Its ability to dismantle the prevailing positivist understanding of the interaction between legal orders and to stand out from the overwhelming and often repetitive literature on the philosophy of EU law should be praised. What is especially noteworthy is the idea of “corrective justice.” This notion explains very well the adoption of financial assistance measures as expression of a new form of solidarity, based on the notion of fair redress for a committed wrong, namely the structural deficiencies detectable in the design of the eurozone.","Fichera, Massimo",Jus Cogens,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7280682/,754

Hence, here we reviewed the early and midterm results of simplified, minimally invasive, beating-heart technique for redo isolated tricuspid valve surgery in patients at high risk. METHODS: A total of 32 consecutive patients underwent a redo isolated tricuspid valve surgery using minimally invasive, beating-heart technique through a right lateral thoracotomy in our center between June 2016 and April 2020. The mean age of patients was 57.4 ± 8.3 years, and 18 patients (56.3%) were women. The mean preoperative EuroSCORE was 7.8 ± 1.4 (range: 6–11). Follow-up was 87.1% complete, with a mean duration of 26.3 ± 12.3 months. RESULTS: Both in-hospital and 30-day mortalities were 3.1%. Tricuspid valve replacement with bioprosthesis was performed in 30 patients (93.8%), and the remaining two patients (6.2%) underwent tricuspid repair (annuloplasty and leaflet reconstruction). The mean cardiopulmonary bypass time was 81.5 ± 29.0 min. The overall in-hospital duration and intensive care unit (ICU) times were 13.6 ± 7.6 days and 4.1 ± 2.8 days, respectively. Postoperative complications included prolonged ventilation in six patients (18.8%), acute kidney injury in three patients (9.4%), and neurologic event, wound infection, or permanent third-degree atrioventricular block, in one patient (3.1%) each. A total of 96.9% patients were discharged uneventfully. Four patients were lost to follow-up; there were no midterm deaths in patients who were followed up. CONCLUSIONS: Simplified, minimally invasive, beating-heart technique for redo tricuspid valve surgery is both feasible and safe, and the early and midterm results are excellent.","Lu, Shuyang; Song, Kai; Yao, Wangchao; Xia, Limin; Dong, Lili; Sun, Yongxin; Hong, Tao; Yang, Shouguo; Wang, Chunsheng",J Cardiothorac Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7301080/,754

Given the rapid development of genomics and immunotherapies, the interference strategies for AML recurrence have been changing these years. More and more novel targeting agents that have received the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for de novo AML treatment have been administrated in the salvage or maintenance therapy of post-HSCT relapse. Targeted strategies that regulate the immune microenvironment of and optimize the graft versus leukemia (GVL) effect of immune cells are gradually improved. Such agents not only have been proven to achieve clinical benefits from a single drug, but if combined with classic therapies, can significantly improve the poor prognosis of AML patients who relapse after allo-HSCT. This review will focus on currently available and promising upcoming agents and also discuss the challenges and limitations of targeted therapies in the allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation community.","Shi, Wei; Jin, Weiwei; Xia, Linghui; Yu, Hu",Acta Pharm Sin B,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7326461/,754

In the United States, several states attempted to manage the pandemic by issuing stay-at-home orders. In this research note, I examine whether the gender of state policy makers in the executive branch might impact a state's adoption of a stay-at-home order. Using event history analysis, I find that the governor's gender has no impact on the likelihood of a state adopting a stay-at-home order. However, I find that gender plays a significant role for agency heads. Specifically, my analysis shows that states with a female-headed health agency tend to adopt stay-at-home orders earlier than states with a male administrator. These findings shed light on how female leadership in the executive branch may impact public policy regarding COVID-19.","Shay, Laine P.",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7360953/,754

Protected amino acid aldehydes obtained by the racemization‐free oxidation of amino alcohols with Dess–Martin periodinane were immobilized on threonyl resins as oxazolidines. Following Boc protection of the ring nitrogen to yield the N‐protected oxazolidine linker, peptide synthesis was performed efficiently on this resin. A peptide aldehyde library was designed for targeting the SARS coronavirus main protease, SARS‐CoV M(pro)(also known as 3CL(pro)), on the basis of three different reported binding modes and supported by virtual screening. A set of 25 peptide aldehydes was prepared by this method and investigated in inhibition assays against SARS‐CoV M(pro). Several potent inhibitors were found with IC(50) values in the low micromolar range. An IC(50) of 7.5 μm was found for AcNSTSQ‐H and AcESTLQ‐H. Interestingly, the most potent inhibitors seem to bind to SARS‐CoV M(pro) in a noncanonical binding mode.","Al‐Gharabli, Samer I.; Shah, Syed T.

Therefore, we created three-dimensional (3D) tactile models of the earth for the visually impaired, utilizing the exact topography data obtained by planetary explorations. Additively manufactured 3D models of the earth can impart an exact shape of relief on their spherical surfaces. In this study, we made improvements to existing models to satisfy the requirements of tactile learning. These improvements were the addition of the equator, prime meridian, and two poles to a basis model. Hence, eight types of model were proposed. The equator and the prime meridian were expressed by the belt on four models (i.e., B1, B2, B3, and B4). The height of their belt was pro-vided in four stages. The equator and the prime meridian were expressed by the gutter on four models (i.e., C1, C2, C3, and C4). The width of their gutter was provided in four stages. The north pole was expressed by a cone, while the south pole was expressed by a cylinder. The two poles have a common shape in all of the eight models. Evaluation experiments revealed that the Earth models developed in this study were useful for tactile learning of the visually impaired.","Teshima, Yoshinori; Hosoya, Yohsuke; Sakai, Kazuma; Nakano, Tsukasa; Tanaka, Akiko; Aomatsu, Toshiaki; Yamazawa, Kenji; Ikegami, Yuji; Watanabe, Yasunari",Computers Helping People with Special Needs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7479795/,754

39428,Eculizumab/tocilizumab: Various toxicities: case report,2020-09-19,"To ensure the faithful inheritance of DNA, a macromolecular protein complex called the kinetochore sustains the connection between chromosomes and force-generating dynamic microtubules during cell division. Defects in this process lead to aneuploidy, a common feature of cancer cells and the cause of many developmental diseases [1, 2, 3, 4]. One of the major microtubule-binding activities in the kinetochore is mediated by the conserved Ndc80 complex (Ndc80c) [5, 6, 7]. In budding yeast, the retention of kinetochores on dynamic microtubule tips also depends on the essential heterodecameric Dam1 complex (Dam1c) [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], which binds to the Ndc80c and is proposed to be a functional ortholog of the metazoan Ska complex [16, 17]. The load-bearing activity of the Dam1c depends on its ability to oligomerize, and the purified complex spontaneously self-assembles into microtubule-encircling oligomeric rings, which are proposed to function as collars that allow kinetochores to processively track the plus-end tips of microtubules and harness the forces generated by disassembling microtubules [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]. However, it is unknown whether there are specific regulatory events that promote Dam1c oligomerization to ensure accurate segregation. Here, we used a reconstitution system to discover that Cdk1, the major mitotic kinase that drives the cell cycle, phosphorylates the Ask1 component of the Dam1c to increase its residence time on microtubules and enhance kinetochore-microtubule attachment strength. We propose that Cdk1 activity promotes Dam1c oligomerization to ensure that kinetochore-microtubule attachments are stabilized as kinetochores come under tension in mitosis.","Gutierrez, Abraham; Kim, Jae ook; Umbreit, Neil T.; Asbury, Charles L.; Davis, Trisha N.; Miller, Matthew P.; Biggins, Sue",Curr Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7497780/,754

39833,Dexamethasone/immune-globulin: Treatment ineffective: case report,2020-09-26,"BACKGROUND: Veno-arterial extracorporeal life support (VA-ECLS) results in cardiopulmonary shunting with reduced native cardiac output (NCO). Low NCO occurrence is common and associated with risk of thromboembolic and pulmonary complications. Practical tools for monitoring NCO during VA-ECLS would therefore be valuable. Pulse pressure (PP) and end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO(2)) are known to be related to cardiac output. We have designed a study to test whether PP and EtCO(2) were efficient for the monitoring of NCO during VA-ECLS. METHODS: In this prospective single-center observational study, patients who underwent a VA-ECLS for cardiogenic shock from January 2016 to October 2017 were included, provided low NCO was suspected by a PP < 20 mmHg. NCO was measured with pulmonary artery catheter or echocardiography and compared to PP and EtCO(2). The ability of PP and EtCO(2) to predict NCO < 1 L/min was evaluated with receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves. RESULTS: Among the 106 patients treated with VA-ECLS for cardiogenic shock during the study period, 26 were studied, allowing the collection of 196 study points. PP and EtCO(2) relationships with NCO were nonlinear and showed strong correlations for NCO < 2 L/min (r = 0.69 and r = 0.78 respectively). A PP < 15 mmHg and EtCO(2) < 14 mmHg had good predictive values for detecting NCO < 1 L/min (area under ROC curve 0.93 [95% CI 0.89–0.96] and 0.97 [95% CI 0.94–0.99] respectively, p = 0.058). CONCLUSIONS: PP and EtCO(2) may offer an accurate real-time monitoring of low NCO events during VA-ECLS support. Further studies are needed to show if their utilization may help to implement therapeutic strategies in order to prevent thromboembolic and respiratory complications associated with VA-ECLS, and to improve patients’ prognosis.

39849,Azithromycin/estrogen/hydroxychloroquine: Cerebral venous thrombosis: 2 case reports,2020-09-26,"To promote innovativeness and efficiency, an increasing number of firms have adopted New ways of working (NWW). However, it is not clear what effect NWW has on innovation-related outcomes, such as intrapreneurial behaviour. Therefore, we provide a first investigation on the relation between the facets of NWW and intrapreneurial behaviour, while testing transformational leadership and co-worker social interaction as mediators. We use a sample of 254 employees of the Dutch working population and apply the Preacher and Hayes’ (Behav Res Methods 40(3):879–891, 2008) bootstrap method for multiple mediation to test our hypotheses. We find that NWW facets time- and location-independent work and management on output are positively related to intrapreneurial behaviour. In addition, we find that the relation between a freely accessible open workplace and intrapreneurial behaviour is mediated by transformational leadership. However, we find no relationship between co-worker social interaction and intrapreneurial behaviour and thus no mediating role for social interaction. Our research adds to the budding literature on the effects of NWW and to the literature on the determinants of intrapreneurial behaviour. We conclude that implementation of several NWW facets and a transformational leadership style could help foster intrapreneurial behaviour among employees, and that future research that further enhances the measurement of the NWW facets and investigates its configurational effects on intrapreneurial behaviour is welcome.","Gerards, Ruud; van Wetten, Sanne; van Sambeek, Cecile",Rev Manag Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7508424/,754

We sought to evaluate the variability of crSO(2) in a cohort of neonates following cardiac surgery with brief or no exposure to DHCA. METHODS: Variability of averaged 1-min crSO(2) values was calculated for the first 48 h following cardiac surgery in consecutive neonates over a 30-month period. Neonates requiring aortic arch repair underwent antegrade cerebral perfusion with either brief or no exposure to DHCA. RESULTS: There were 115 neonates included in the study. Reduced crSO(2) variability was observed in neonates with aortic arch obstruction (p = 0.02) and non-survivors (p = 0.02). Post hoc analysis demonstrated that the reduction in crSO(2) variability was not as marked as in previously studied neonates with aortic arch obstruction who received DHCA alone (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Neonates with aortic arch obstruction have reduced crSO(2) variability following cardiac surgery. The reduction in crSO(2) variability observed in aortic arch obstruction is likely influenced by a number of factors, including perioperative perfusion technique. The impact of interventions on crSO(2) variability and resultant influence on neurodevelopmental outcomes requires further study. IMPACT: Neonates with aortic arch obstruction have reduced crSO(2) variability following cardiac surgery, which has been associated with poor neurodevelopmental outcomes, and is likely influenced by a number of factors, including perioperative perfusion technique. The contribution of perioperative perfusion technique to crSO(2) variability following neonatal cardiac surgery is significant. Monitoring of crSO(2) variability may provide insights into the adequacy of cerebral perfusion in neonates following cardiac surgery.","Spaeder, Michael C.; Surma, Victoria J.",Pediatr Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7523257/,754

The Wuhan coronavirus epidemic continues to spread globally to the new European hotspot in Italy. New information about the epidemic and the virus is changing rapidly as the virus spreads and appears in parts of the world. Although official announcements by the Croatian Government and Crisis Staff calmed the public with pictures and data on the disease, it showed something else that heightened public concern and caused two conflicting phenomena among citizens - on the one hand, the majority showed understandable doubt about the information that could have raised the concern for their own health while the rest of the population ignored the facts. The market showed complete unwillingness to cope with this epidemic and a chronic shortage of protective equipment (masks, disinfectants...) emerged. Most of the citizens' queries and concerns were moving in the direction of personal protection, child protection and justification for holding large gatherings. RESULTS: By March 8, 2020, twelve COVID-19 patients were recorded in Croatia, of which 5 were patients in Rijeka, 3 in Zagreb and 4 in VaraÅ¾din. The first sick person is a Croatian citizen from Zagreb who became infected during his stay in Italy (Milan, Lombardy province). CONCLUSIONS: The first source of communication often becomes the source against which everyone else is measured. Accuracy is crucial to credibility. Emotion cannot be countered by facts. People must first know that the government cares. The public should regain a sense of control over circumstances beyond control. A lack of public respect in a crisis undermines trust. Honesty is fundamental to maintaining trust. KEY MESSAGES: Accuracy is crucial to credibility.

41756,Metformin: Various toxicities: case report,2020-11-07,"BACKGROUND: The elderly population has been growing in most low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), and depression is a common condition among these populations. The lack of integration between mental health and primary healthcare services and the shortage of mental health specialists in the public health system contribute to underdiagnosis and undertreatment of depression. One of the strategies to reduce this gap is task shifting and collaborative care treatments. This study therefore aims to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a collaborative care psychosocial intervention to improve the clinical management of depression among elderly people in poor neighbourhoods in Guarulhos, Brazil. METHODS: Two-arm, cluster randomised controlled trial with Basic Health Units as the clusters and a 1:1 allocation ratio. Twenty Basic Health Units have been randomly selected and randomised to control or intervention arms. We aim to recruit 1440 adults (72 per cluster) aged 60 years or over identified with depression (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) score ≥ 10). The control arm participants will receive an enhanced usual care, while the intervention arm participants will receive an enhanced usual care and a 17-week psychosocial intervention programme delivered at home by community health workers with the help of an application installed on tablet computers. The primary outcome is the proportion with depression recovery (PHQ-9 < 10) at 8 months’ follow-up. We will also assess the maintenance of any earlier clinical gains and the cost-effectiveness of the intervention at 12 months. DISCUSSION: This is the first randomised trial to investigate a collaborative care intervention to treat depression among poor elderly in LMIC/Latin America. This is a major public health problem worldwide, but in these countries, there are no locally tested, evidence-based interventions available to date.

AIM AND OBJECTIVES: To compare the effect of prophylactic versus therapeutic doses of enoxaparin in the treatment of severe cases of COVID-19 infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study conducted at Latifa hospital, Dubai. Fifty-nine patients enrolled from March to June 2020 and divided into 2 groups: patients who received the prophylactic dose of enoxaparin (group 1) and patients who received the therapeutic dose of enoxaparin (group 2). RESULTS: The mean age of all cases was 47.2 ± 10.4 years, while the mean weight was 76.4 ± 13.4 kg. Males represented 79.7% of cases. Blood group “O” was the most frequent blood group (40.9%). None of the cases were smokers or using alcohol. Bronchial asthma, lung diseases, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, CKD, cardiac disease, thyroid disease, and immunodeficiency were present in 1.7, 1.7, 39, 27.1, 5.1, 1.7, 5.1, and 1.7% respectively. There was no significant difference between both study groups regarding personal and medical characteristics, except for hypertension where 35.9% of group 2 (therapeutic) cases were hypertensive compared to 10% of group 1 cases (prophylactic). There was a significant difference between both study groups regarding inflammatory markers improvement duration, duration of MV and O2 support duration, with longer duration among (therapeutic) group 2 cases compared to group 1 cases (prophylactic). There was a highly significant difference between both study groups regarding ICU admission, as 64% of group 1 cases were admitted compared to 25% of group 1 cases. Similarly, 38.5% of group 2 cases needed MV compared to only 10% of group 1 cases, which was statistically significant. There was no significant difference between both groups regarding bleeding tendency and mortality (p value 0.54). CONCLUSION: Our results showed that use of prophylactic dose of enoxaparin might have some benefits compared to the therapeutic dose in terms of less duration of ICU and hospital stay, duration of oxygen support, need and duration of MV, and normalization of inflammatory markers. However, there was no significant difference between the 2 regimens regarding the mortality.","Elmelhat, Ahmed; Elbourai, Essam; Dewedar, Hany; Elgergawi, Taghrid; Alkhanbouli, Maryam; Ahmed, Salwa; Malik, Zoiya; Nugud, Alaa; Mohammed, Shadha; Mohammad, Hozaifah; Husain, Abdullah",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7649681/,754

43076,Midazolam: Aspiration: case report,2020-12-12,"OBJECTIVE: This observational cross-sectional multicenter study aimed to evaluate the longitudinal impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on neurosurgical practice. METHODS: We included 29 participating neurosurgeons in centers from all geographical regions in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The study period, which was between March 5, 2020 and May 20, 2020, was divided into three equal periods to determine the longitudinal effect of COVID-19 measures on neurosurgical practice over time. RESULTS: During the 11-week study period, 474 neurosurgical interventions were performed. The median number of neurosurgical procedures per day was 5.5 (interquartile range [IQR]: 3.5–8). The number of cases declined from 72 in the first week and plateaued at the 30’s range in subsequent weeks. The most and least number of performed procedures were oncology (129 [27.2%]) and functional procedures (6 [1.3%]), respectively. Emergency (Priority 1) cases were more frequent than non-urgent (Priority 4) cases (178 [37.6%] vs. 74 [15.6%], respectively). In our series, there were three positive COVID-19 cases. There was a significant among-period difference in the length of hospital stay, which dropped from a median stay of 7 days (IQR: 4 – 18) to 6 (IQR: 3 - 13) to 5 days (IQR: 2 - 8). There was no significant among-period difference with respect to institution type, complications, or mortality. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that the COVID-19 pandemic decreased the number of procedures performed in neurosurgery practice. The load of emergency neurosurgery procedures did not change throughout the three periods, which reflects the need to designate ample resources to cover emergencies. Notably, with strict screening for COVID -19 infections, neurosurgical procedures could be safely performed during the early pandemic phase. We recommend to restart performing neurosurgical procedures once the pandemic gets stabilized to avoid possible post-pandemic health-care system intolerable overload.","Alatar, Abdullah; Bajunaid, Khalid; Alqurashi, Ashwag; Ajlan, Abdulrazag",Neuro Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7650349/,754

44244,Durvalumab: Immune-related pneumonitis: case report,2021-01-02,"BACKGROUND: The clinical presentation of SARS-CoV-2 disease ranges from asymptomatic respiratory infection to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Risk factors upon hospital admission associated with the need for invasive mechanical ventilation are not well documented. METHODS: 185 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled in this study, and they were classified as patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation and patients who did not require it. Comorbidities such as diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, chronic lung disease and immunodeficiency were recorded. Laboratory studies were requested upon admission such as C-reactive protein, leukocyte and lymphocyte levels, D-dimer, troponin, serum ferritin and procalcitonin. RESULTS: Of the patients who entered the study, 65 patients (35%) required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), while 120 (65%) did not require advanced airway management. Of the patients with invasive mechanical ventilation, age > 65 years, male sex, obesity (BMI > 30) and high blood pressure were the most frequent characteristics, presenting the latter two in 26% and 27% respectively. Regarding laboratory studies, the parameters most associated with the requirement for mechanical ventilation were a D-dimer (> 1000) and troponin (> 1), with 26% and 18%, respectively. CONCLUSION: This study showed the high proportion of obesity, hypertension and advanced age among patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation associated with SARS-CoV2 infection. The presence of elevated D-dimer and troponin on admission are associated with more severe presentations and a requirement for invasive mechanical ventilation.

44255,Remdesivir: Bowel Perforation: case report,2021-01-02,"BACKGROUND: Many viruses infect salivary glands. These include mumps, Epstein-Barr, herpes virus 6, parainfluenza, influenza, adeno virus, boca virus and others. Almost all coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) infected patients carry the virus in saliva. Salivary duct epithelium were the early target cells in macaque monkeys infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus (SARS-COV). Here we present 2 COVID-19 cases with the involvement of salivary glands. Salivary gland involvement has not been reported in COVID-19. METHODS: We followed the COVID 19 clinical findings in a Pennsylvania long term care facility with 190 residents. Thirty tested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive. However, 48 were presumed infected. Eighteen likely cases were not tested due to shortage of swabs. Thirty four employees also tested positive. Two out of 48 patients aged 78 and 88 developed unilateral sialadenitis during the course of the illness. Both were Hispanic females. We studied the Clinical presentations, co-morbidities, lab and imaging results and the outcome. RESULTS: Case 1: Two days after the first confirmed case, a 88 year old Hispanic female developed fever and fatigue and tested COVID-19 positive. Fever lasted 5 days. Twenty days later the patient developed a 5x3 cm tender left parotid mass and hypoxia treated with oxygen via nasal cannula. (Table 1) Case 2: A 78 year old Hispanic female developed high fever and cough 7 days after the index case. Six days later she had persistent fever and presented with a tender 8.5x3.5 cm right submandibular mass. The patient was intubated for 3 days to protect the airway due to the size of the mass. Both made an uneventful recovery. (Table 1 and Figure 1) CONCLUSION: New clinical findings of COVID -19 have been gradually added during the course of the pandemic. The virus is almost universally present in the saliva. In experimental Chinese macaques with SARS-COV early target cells were the salivary duct epithelium. Salivary gland inflammation and swelling should be included amongst the clinical features of COVID-19.

44261,Sugammadex: Anaphylaxis: case report,2021-01-02,"BACKGROUND: In Louisiana, deaths related to COVID-19 have disproportionately occurred in Black persons. Granular data are needed to better understand inequities and develop prevention strategies to mitigate further impact on Black communities. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients admitted to an urban safety net hospital in New Orleans, LA with reactive SARS-CoV-2 testing from March 9–31, 2020. Clinical characteristics and outcomes of Black and other racial/ethnic group patients were compared using Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Fisher’s exact tests. We examined Day-14 status using an ordinal scale to assess race and outcome. Table 1. Demographics and Comorbidities by Race for Patients Hospitalized with COVID-19 [Image: see text] Table 2. Clinical Characteristics at Presentation by Race for Patients Hospitalized with COVID-19, March 2020 [Image: see text] RESULTS: This study included 249 patients. Median age was 59, 44% were male, 86% were age ≥65 years or had ≥1 comorbidity. Overall, 87% were Black, relative to 55% Black patients typically hospitalized at our center. Black patients had longer symptom duration at presentation (6.41 versus 5.88 days, p=0.05), and were more likely to have asthma (p=0.008), but less likely to have dementia (p=0.002). There were no racial differences in initial respiratory status or laboratory values other than higher initial LDH in Black patients. Patient age and initial oxygen requirement, but not race (adjusted proportional odds ratio = 0.92, 95%CI: 0.70–1.20), were associated with worse Day-14 outcomes. Figure 1: Admissions over time by Race [Image: see text] Figure 2a: Hospital outcomes by Race over the Follow-up period [Image: see text] Figure 2b: Day-14 Outcomes by Race [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate minor racial differences in comorbidities or disease severity at presentation, and Day-14 outcomes were not different between groups. However, Black patients were disproportionately represented in hospitalizations, suggesting that prevention efforts should include strategies to limit SARS-CoV-2 exposures in Black communities as one step towards reducing racial inequities related to COVID-19.

Previously, it has been shown by the authors that the first day of creation is the day when the primary foundations of everything, i.e., the cores of the Sun (stars) and planets, which are composed of protons and neutrons in different ratios, were created and the thermonuclear processes were started; the second day is the formation of the Earth’s mantle and primary crust, the hydrosphere, and the Earth’s atmosphere; and the most important day is the third, when the Earth’s crust, the hydrosphere, and the biosphere were formed as the future cradle of humanity. This paper considers 4—6 days of world creation according to the Bible: the fourth day as the epoch of the Cambrian burst of biological diversity emerging on the Earth due to the flaring Sun and the appearance of the second luminary—the Moon; the fifth day is the epoch when transparency of the atmosphere and its nitrogen–oxygen composition caused an evolution burst in the development of terrestrial life, i.e., the appearance of fishes, animals, and birds. Before this moment, the life “evolved” at the level of viruses, bacteria, and protozoal algae. In this paper, the main focus is laid on the appearance of viruses as the most mysterious Earth’s creatures, which may also be born in the space, have unique properties, and represent the most numerous biological forms able to injure all the types of archaeon organisms up to the human. It has been shown that water is the cradle of life, and its evolution and the development of cell life occurs in it only as a deuterium concentration of 150 ± 50 mg/dm(3). At different concentrations, water becomes an unsuitable medium for any biological life. As a result of the sixth day, the creation of the Earth was terminated and the foundations and the evolution processes launched by God were laid for the further development of the vegetal and animal world in compliance with biological laws. The events reflected in the Bible are real, the predictions are true, and we merely need to draw the correct conclusions about our past, present, and future.","Goncharuk, V. V.; Goncharuk, D.

45431,Losartan: Hypotension and acute kidney injury: 7 case reports,2021-02-06,"Thermoplastics combine high freedom of design with economical mass production. Metallic coatings on thermoplastics enable power and signal transmission, shield sensitive parts inside of housings and can reduce the temperature in critical areas by functioning as a heat sink. The most used technical thermoplastics are polyamides (PA), while the described use cases are often realized using Cu. Consequently, several studies tried to apply copper coatings on PA substrates via thermal spraying; so far, this combination is only feasible using an interlayer. In this study, a new approach to metallize thermoplastics via thermal spraying based on validated state-of-the-art predictions of the thermoplastics’ material response at relevant temperatures and strain rates is presented. Using these predictions, high velocity wire-arc spraying was selected as coating process. Furthermore, the process parameters were adapted to realize a continuous coating while also roughening the substrate during coating deposition. The resulting Cu coating on PA6 had a sufficiently high coating adhesion for post-treatment by grinding. The adhesion is achieved by in situ roughening during the coating application. The results indicate that different process parameters for initial layer deposition and further coating buildup are required due to the low thermal stability of PA6.","Bobzin, Kirsten; Wietheger, Wolfgang; Knoch, Martin Andreas",J Therm Spray Tech,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7847715/,754

The changes in the suspensions’ zeta potential, pH, viscosity and Turbiscan Stability Index (TSI) were monitored over their aging time of 1 to 7 days. The results showed that α-Terpineol is the most effective surfactant to produce functionally stable suspensions with low viscosity and surface tension values.

This is highly relevant, since health advantages in one domain (e.g., being a permanent formal full-time worker) may offset health disadvantages in other domains (e.g., being a regular smoker or alcohol consumer); conversely, disadvantages in both domains may interact, leading to even greater health risks. Considering these knowledge gaps, this research has two main objectives: (1) to reconstruct simultaneous employment, tobacco use, and alcohol consumption trajectories over the life course (from birth to old age) and (2) to measure the association between these trajectories and CVD in old age. Drawing on a rich and comprehensive life history dataset and using multichannel sequence and regression analyses, we analyzed a cohort of individuals aged 65–75 in Chile, a Latin American country with high social inequalities and scarce research on this matter. Our study shows that following a trajectory of formal employment together with no tobacco and alcohol use reduces CVD risk by 36 percentage points relative to a similar employment trajectory but with regular tobacco and alcohol use. Even with an employment trajectory characterized by constant informal employment or permanent inactivity, a life course free of regular tobacco and alcohol use shows protective effects against CVD. This study stresses the importance of health policies that consider CVD as a condition that strongly depends on individual experiences in multiple life domains and across different life stages.","Madero-Cabib, Ignacio; Azar, Ariel; Bambs, Claudia",SSM Popul Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7848642/,754

Despite the rapid, widespread implementation, research regarding the impact LC has on pedagogy and student attainment is limited and not conclusive in its findings. It is still unclear if there is a causal or a correlated relationship between attainment and usage of LC. This systematic review sought to collate and compare the current literature on the efficacy of LC in tertiary mathematics education and provide practical advice for institutions that use or plan to use LC. The literature is consistent in the opinion that students and administrators positively view LC for its utility and flexibility despite the moderately strong evidence that most institutions face attendance drops. However, most students do tend to see attending lectures/watching recordings as an “either-or.” The literature predominantly reports a negative association between attainment and the use of LC as a substitute to live lectures. The proportion of students who choose to skip live lectures has steadily increased over the last decade as the student campus culture adjusts to LC. Within this group, LC is used imperfectly, providing false benefits and promoting surface learning strategies. There is evidence that regular use of LC by this large group of students may diminish the quality of their learning. We offer research-informed, evidence-based recommendations to mitigate the unplanned and counterproductive impact of LC implementation.","Lindsay, Euan; Evans, Tanya",Math Ed Res J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7882467/,754

By taking a close look at three offices—the donation, intake, and disbursement office—I untangle the regime of care that shapes the daily transactions at this Islamic charity organization. In particular I highlight a significant gap between “caring for” and “caring about.” Donors view caring for those in need as a duty and frequently frame their donations in calculative terms, as a way of “trading with God.” Less central is a language of empathy or compassion. While this seemingly careless care-less?

45936,Cladribine: Lymphopenia: case report,2021-02-20,"BACKGROUND: The COVID‐19 pandemic has halted many Alzheimer’s Disease clinical trials, with some forced to re‐start at different points along the trial time‐line with substantial protocol amendments and patients dropping out with substantial partial assessments. To align the functional outcomes of these protocol amendments with the original trial design at the individual patient level, we propose to use Physiology‐Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK) and Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP) Modeling to ‘correct’ the cognitive trajectory of mirror virtual patient population back to the original trail design. METHOD: The Virtual Twin approach creates a PBPK computer‐simulated model of each patient with a virtual twin QSP model of trial subjects, with the same co‐medications, common genotype variants affecting metabolism and cognitive outcome; β‐amyloid and tau biomarkers. The QSP platform is a previously ADAS‐Cog calibrated model of key neuronal circuits involved in cognition, allowing to model the effects of CNS active co‐medications based on their pharmacology and genotypes based on imaging studies. In this Virtual Twin approach, the platform will be extensively validated against the actual clinical data from the completer set and the fragmented outcomes of the restarters with their individual protocol amendments, before simulating the cognitive trajectory with the original trial design for those whose trial was interrupted. RESULT: Different interruption scenarios in a 24‐month AD study of a bi‐weekly amyloid antibody infusion are simulated with increased anxiolytics and anti‐depressants use after restart. The impact of changes is dependent upon the genotype combination with the 5‐HTTLPR rs 23351 > APOE > COMTVal158Met and different for placebo and active treatment. Anti‐depressants and benzo also differentially substantially affect the cognitive trajectory. We illustrate how to reconstruct the cognitive trajectory of 600 subjects (out of 1200) affected by the interruption. CONCLUSION: Combining QSP modeling of the biology with PBPK modeling and extensive validation with the fragmented clinical data available, in principle allows to reconstruct the original cognitive trajectory in patients affected by the COVID‐19 interruption. In this way, the original trial design and statistical analysis plan can be applied to achieve a fair evaluation of the clinical effect of the investigative new drug.","Geerts, Hugo; Van der Graaf, Piet",Alzheimers Dement,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7883028/,754

46135,Parenteral nutrition supplements: Hyperglycaemia: case report,2021-02-27,"This paper demonstrates the impact of path-dependent policy paradigms on institutional progression. This could involve institutional journeys from democracy to authoritarianism, from federalism to centralization, and vice versa. First, we posit that policy ideas are more important than material interests for the evolution of historical paths. Second, the sequence of path construction is equally important. This paper points to the significance of policy ideas for the construction of two sequences—a layering–tipping–displacement path—and a path of institutional drift. Our case work describes how the layered evolution of ideas led to a tipping point that transformed a public sector-driven regime into a private sector oriented one in 1991, thereby unleashing India’s rapid economic growth. The causal mechanism suggests that layering leading to a tipping point that displaces the old paradigm can reveal why overtly abrupt change may result from gradual endogenous processes. This is a largely unexplored causal mechanism in comparative politics. The paper also demonstrates that an ideational drift away from the federalising frame evolved since 2014. It has resulted in famishing the Indian sub-national states for development expenditure, especially at the time of COVID-19. Scholars have suggested the causal logic behind conversion, drift, layering and displacement largely based on material factors. This paper connects ideas embedded in policy paradigms with two of these paths.","Mukherji, Rahul; Zarhani, Seyed Hossein",GPPG,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7893618/,754

First, the pandemic has exacerbated various types of morally uncivil behaviour, such as discrimination and hate. Moreover, COVID-19 has created opportunities for some political actors to put forward sectarian agendas, grounded in partial interests and controversial beliefs, that breach the demands of justificatory civility. Furthermore, some policies to contain the pandemic have resulted in unreasonable ‘strains of commitment’ for members of marginalized sectors of the population, such as racial minorities, women, the LGBTIQ+ community, and older people; governments should acknowledge this aspect when publicly justifying these policies. Finally, justificatory civility during the pandemic has been undermined by scientific uncertainty around particular aspects of the virus itself; limited research on its social and cultural dimensions; and the politicization of science for personal or partisan advantage. The chapter advances numerous suggestions to counteract these challenges to moral and justificatory civility.","Bonotti, Matteo; Zech, Steven T.",Recovering Civility during COVID-19,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7924097/,754

Software Defect Prediction (SDP) is no exception to this latent problem. Solutions such as data sampling and ensemble methods have been proposed to address the class imbalance problem in SDP. This study proposes a combination of Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and homogeneous ensemble (Bagging and Boosting) methods for predicting software defects. The proposed approach was implemented using Decision Tree (DT) and Bayesian Network (BN) as base classifiers on defects datasets acquired from NASA software corpus. The experimental results showed that the proposed approach outperformed other experimental methods. High accuracy of 86.8% and area under operating receiver characteristics curve value of 0.93% achieved by the proposed technique affirmed its ability to differentiate between the defective and non-defective labels without bias.,"Balogun, Abdullateef O.; Lafenwa-Balogun, Fatimah B.; Mojeed, Hammed A.; Adeyemo, Victor E.; Akande, Oluwatobi N.; Akintola, Abimbola G.; Bajeh, Amos O.; Usman-Hamza, Fatimah E.",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974969/,754

Communications subsystems and a ground station are integrated, with which an unmanned aerial system (UAS) is formed, carrying out the necessary calibrations and configurations. After a set of tests and the necessary adjustments, a long-distance mission is carried out and its energy consumption, height reached and trajectory tracking are analyzed. In addition, the video signal level obtained and the percentage of telemetry signal in each of the tests are established, which managed to be 90% with a distance greater than 4 km.

We model social and behaviour change communication intervention among other components of a water-sanitation-hygiene (WASH) system in response to the menace of open defecation in rural and urban communities globally. We also used experimental outcomes to show empirically that patterns in data captured in the WASH process could be learnt for effective decision making using deep learning neural networks as an intelligent software engineering technique. Eradicating open defecation is one of the indicators used for measuring progress made towards the attainment of Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6). We use the Adum-Aiona community in Nigeria as case study in designing community-based total sanitation programs using software model-driven engineering approaches with the aim of promoting their implementation. This is because even when toilets and other sanitary infrastructure are available, behavior and social change efforts are needed to promote their large-scale use. Also, we demonstrate that besides being used to model software systems, computational models (software architecture) are useful in documenting and promoting understanding of concepts in virtually all fields of human endeavour. Our motivation is that enhancing understanding of open defecation through software modelling would help SDG 6 implementors and actors attain set sanitation goals in both rural and urban communities towards the SDGs target year 2030.","Okewu, Emmanuel; Misra, Sanjay; Lius, Fernandez-Sanz",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974978/,754

Milestones have been reached recently in the management of EBOV disease (EVD) with licensure of an EBOV vaccine and two monoclonal antibody therapies. However, neither vaccines nor therapies are available for other disease-causing filoviruses. In preparation for such outbreaks, and for more facile and cost-effective management of EVD, we seek a cocktail containing orally available and room temperature stable drugs with strong activity against multiple filoviruses. We previously showed that (bepridil + sertraline) and (sertraline + toremifene) synergistically suppress EBOV in cell cultures. Here, we describe steps towards testing these combinations in a mouse model of EVD. We identified a vehicle suitable for oral delivery of the component drugs and determined that, thus formulated the drugs are equally active against EBOV as preparations in DMSO, and they maintain activity upon storage in solution for up to seven days. Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies indicated that the drugs in the oral delivery vehicle are well tolerated in mice at the highest doses tested. Collectively the data support advancement of these combinations to tests for synergy in a mouse model of EVD.

Unemployment rate prediction achieved researcher attention from a fast few years. The intention of doing our research is to examine the impact of the coronavirus on the unemployment rate. Accurately predicting the unemployment rate is a stimulating job for policymakers, which plays an imperative role in a country's financial and financial development planning. Classical time series models such as ARIMA models and advanced non‐linear time series methods be previously hired for unemployment rate prediction. It is known to us that mostly these data sets are non‐linear as well as non‐stationary. Consequently, a random error can be produced by a distinct time series prediction model. Our research considers hybrid prediction approaches supported by linear and non‐linear models to preserve forecast the unemployment rates much precisely. These hybrid approaches of the unemployment rate can advance their estimates by reproducing the unemployment ratio irregularity. These models' appliance is exposed to six unemployment rate statistics sets from Europe's selected countries, specifically France, Spain, Belgium, Turkey, Italy and Germany. Among these hybrid models, the hybrid ARIMA‐ARNN forecasting model performed well for France, Belgium, Turkey and Germany, whereas hybrid ARIMA‐SVM performed outclass for Spain and Italy. Furthermore, these models are used for the best future prediction. Results show that the unemployment rate will be higher in the coming years, which is the consequence of the coronavirus, and it will take at least 5 years to overcome the impact of COVID‐19 in these countries.","Ahmad, Muneeb; Khan, Yousaf Ali; Jiang, Chonghui; Kazmi, Syed Jawad Haider; Abbas, Syed Zaheer",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8013453/,754

It has become the worldwide pandemic in recent few years. It is a kind of haemorrhagic fever, caused by SFTS virus (SFTSV), a novel phlebovirus of family Bunyaviridae. This syndrome is also a tick-borne zoonosis that means the virus transmitted from tick bite (having virus) into human body, i.e. infection spread from animals to humans and also transmitted from human to human. Epidemiological data of SFTS was collected to know the nature/symptoms of SFTSV. First case of this disease has been reported in China, followed by Japan, South korea, Taiwan, USA and many other countries. Vertebrates are the host of this disease and tick functions as a vector, where the virus can undergo brisk changes using gene mutation, homologous recombination and reassortments. The major symptoms of hemorrhagic fever are fever, thrombocytopenia, leucopenia and gastrointestinal abnormalities. Sometimes in very severe cases, full body organ failure may also take place and average death rate in humans is nearly 10 %. Old aged peoples are more prone to SFTSV infection. Apart from the fact of increasing SFTSV related health problems to humans, the pathogenesis of SFTS virus in human is not entirely understood and no treatment to this virus is still available. The simplest way to protect our self from this infection is to refrain from tick bite. Therefore, this disease has evolved to produce serious health issues to humans in various countries of world including china. This review discussing about causative agent, epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of SFTS. In order to control the spread of SFTSV, we have to stop the viral transmission or to protect the easily vulnerable population from tick bites, avoiding direct contact of infectious and also to use personal protective devices for SFTS patients. So, the weather conditions, mode of transmission and creation of new therapeutics like vaccines and drugs are the main areas of forthcoming research.","Sharma, Divya; Kamthania, Mohit",Virusdisease,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8082055/,754

Following this realization are recommendations for implementing climate-smart agriculture (CSA) as adaptation and resilience pathways to address the negative ramifications of climate change impacts. While CSA mainstreaming is strong at the global and national levels, it remains a challenge at the local level. To understand CSA mainstreaming at the local level, this paper utilizes mixed-content analysis to deconstruct eleven local development plans for the 2018–2021 plan period for the Upper West Region, a semi-arid region of Ghana. Results show that CSA mainstreaming is a challenge, despite a general awareness of climate change impacts on agriculture. The plans lacked adequate data on local climate change trends and impacts leading to discrepancies among CSA problematization, development goals, objectives, and strategies—raising serious concerns about ownership and localization of CSA in semi-arid Ghana. Also, awareness of climate finance opportunities to support CSA interventions was absent in the plans. This paper suggests a review of the national guidelines for preparing local development plans by integrating resources for CSA, climate assessment and information systems, and climate finance opportunities. This should be complemented by building institutional capacity and partnerships with nongovernmental organizations as well as other development partners working on CSA at the local level.","Diko, Stephen Kofi; Okyere, Seth Asare; Opoku Mensah, Seth; Ahmed, Abubakari; Yamoah, Owusua; Kita, Michihiro",Socio Ecol Pract Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8082745/,754

When the majority resided in rural areas, and lived predominantly agrarian lifestyles, it made sense for the state to govern food security through national agricultural ministries, focusing predominantly on the availability dimension of food security. With the transition to a majority urban world, coupled with the food security challenges currently experienced in urban areas, specifically in Africa, these historical policy and governance structures are increasingly inadequate in responding to essential food and nutrition needs. Problematically, urban areas, and specifically urban managers, cite unfunded mandates, and absent authority, as the reasons for not engaging food and nutrition governance responses. This paper argues that this is a false position. Drawing on recent data from household food security and poverty surveys, the paper calls for new and expanded planning and design approaches at the urban scale. The paper argues that spatial planning and urban design principles and actions provide an immediate and effective means through which to engage urban food system questions. Importantly these actions are essential to the transition from the current piecemeal project responses to urban food system inadequacies. Food sensitive planning and urban design is offered as a specific approach that could assist in programming food system–related challenges at the urban scale, responding to conceptual, analytical, organisational and design related dimensions of planning, and in so doing offering a longer term, systematic response to urban food insecurity.","Haysom, Gareth",Urban Forum,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8083919/,754

Clinical Case: A 64-year-old man (BMI 25kg/m2, weight 75kg) with past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (on metformin and sitagliptin; glycated haemoglobin 51 mmol/mol, n<42mmol/mol), hypertension, G6PD deficiency and gout was admitted to hospital with COVID pneumonitis and type 1 respiratory failure giving 5 days’ history of cough, shortness of breath, fatigue and tiredness. As per hospital guidelines, the patient was treated with amoxicillin/clavulanate 625mg three times daily and doxycycline 100mg once daily. Hydroxycholoroquine was not given in view of G6PD deficiency. There was no evidence of diabetic ketoacidosis and a short-acting insulin sliding scale was initiated at 2U/hr. Continuous positive pressure ventilation was offered for next 72 hours, however the patient failed to improve and required transfer to intensive care unit for intubation and mechanical ventilation. Computer tomography scan of pulmonary artery excluded embolism. The patient was fed via nasogastric tube post intubation. On day 8, the patient experienced a sudden drop in haemoglobin levels from 132 g/dl on day 1 to 68 g/dl, requiring multiple blood transfusions. The blood results demonstrated evidence of haemolysis with a rise in total and direct bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase levels. The peripheral blood smear showed numerous bite cells with polychromasia suggesting an acute haemolytic crisis in the context of G6PD deficiency. A medication review revealed no evidence of drug-induced haemolysis. Later the patient was started on dexamethasone 6mg once daily (day 11) and on remdesivir 100mg once daily (day 15). During this time, the patient’s insulin infusion requirements had progressively increased from 2U/hr to 8U/hr (equivalent to 192 units/24 hr). On day 22, the patient’s clinical condition deteriorated with septicaemia requiring extended course of antibiotics. At this time, continuous insulin infusion was stopped and intermediate acting insulin (insulatard 36U twice daily; later increased to 48U twice daily) was started. In the next 10 days, the patient made good clinical recovery from sepsis with stable haemoglobin and blood sugar levels. He was extubated and transferred for rehabilitation. The patient was successfully weaned off insulin in the community with optimal diabetes control. Conclusion: This is a case demonstrating the possible role of SARS-CoV-2 in increased insulin resistance and severe haemolytic crisis on background of diabetes and G6PD deficiency.","Joshi, Hareesh; Earle, Kenneth",J Endocr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8090178/,754

This restricted access to usual food, workplace, and leisure sports, and also led to reduced clinic attendance. The effects of MCO on patients with chronic lifestyle diseases like DM is unknown. Methodology: This is a cross-sectional study exploring effects of MCO on adult (>18 years) DM patients (both Type 1 and Type 2) attending endocrinologist-run DM clinics in 3 tertiary centres in Malaysia. Glycaemic and metabolic parameters were collected through medical record review while data on healthcare utilisation, dietary and lifestyle habits before MCO (17 Nov 2019 to 17 Mar 2020) and during MCO were collected by investigator-administered questionnaires during routine clinic follow-up after the MCO period (10 Jun to 30 Oct 2020). Results: From a total of 207 patients (56.5% female, 73.4% T2D and 80% on insulin) no significant difference between mean (SD) A1c [8.6(2.39) % vs 8.4(2.14) %; p=0.073] or BMI [29.2(7.57) vs 29.4(9.23)kg/m(2); p=0.968] were seen before and during MCO respectively. More than 95% of the patients attended clinic before MCO and at least 20.3% saw either the DM nurse educator, DM pharmacist or dietitian. In contrast, during MCO only 31.4% of patients attended clinic and less than 10% had face-to-face consultation with the DM support team. More patients also reported missing insulin (11.6% vs 7.7%) and not checking blood glucose (17.9% vs 15.5%) during MCO. Before MCO, 61.8% of patients had home-cooked food daily. During MCO this increased to 83.1%. However, there was a trend towards unhealthy eating during MCO. Patients reported eating more frequently with those eating more than 4 meals a day nearly tripled during MCO (18.4% vs 6.8%). In addition, 22% of patients recalled consuming more confectionary; a similar percentage also reported higher consumption of processed food like dry snacks, canned food and instant noodles during MCO. Mean (SD) hours of sleep [6.8 (1.35) vs 7.2 (1.73) hours; p<0.001] and screen time [3.3 (2.51) vs 4.51 (3.10] hours, p< 0.001) increased significantly during MCO compared to before. Notably, before MCO 44% of patients reported no exercise and this increased to 65.7% during MCO. Conclusion: Despite reduced clinic attendance and contact with the DM support team, there were no consequent significant change in A1c or BMI of our DM patients from the 3-month MCO in our short term study. However, a worrying increase in sedentariness and unhealthy eating existed. The imperative need to conduct work or lessons online, among others contributed to the inevitable rise in screen time and reduced physical activity. As the pandemic continues with imposed movement restrictions, the long-term implications of MCO to metabolic health warrant our attention. Innovative strategies to promote healthier living during MCO are urgently needed.","Kuan, Yueh Chien; Tong, Chin Voon; Katiman, Elliyyin; Tiong, Xun Ting; Chan, Pei Lin; Tan, Florence; Noor, Nurain Mohd",J Endocr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8090270/,754
52568,Methotrexate: Hypersensitivity pneumonitis: case report,2021-05-08,"Aim: In response to new updated guidance from Society For Endocrinology April 2020, this Audit was conduct to assess the adequacy of steroid replacement in confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients with adrenal insufficiency or adrenal suppression admitted to Bedford District General Hospital. In steroid dependent patients (Addison’s disease, adrenal insufficiency, pituitary steroid insufficiency, use of long term steroids for other conditions - 5mg or more of prednisolone (or equivalent doses) daily for longer than 4 weeks) admitted to hospital very unwell with confirmed or suspected COVID recommendations is to start on Hydrocortisone 100 mg per IV injection followed by continuous IV infusion of 200 mg hydrocortisone/24h (alternatively 50 mg every 6 h per intravenous or IM bolus injection). Method: Retrospect data collection on Patients admitted in May 2020 to Bedford Hospital with suspected or confirmed COVID 19 disease with adrenal insufficiency or on long term steroid use. Those patients should be started on Hydrocortisone 100 mg per IV injection followed by continuous IV infusion of 200 mg hydrocortisone/24h (alternatively 50 mg every 6 h per intravenous or IM bolus injection). Results: In May 2020, 295 patients admitted under the medical team in Bedford Hospital with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. Only 12 patients met the inclusion criteria, one patient with a diagnosis of Addison disease and the remaining 11 patients on long term steroids. None of these patients were managed as per updated guidelines. 6 patients had less than the adequate dose, they were started on prednisolone 30-40mg. 4 patients dose of oral steroids was only doubled, 1 patient received the same dose of oral steroid and the only confirmed Addison had higher dose of hydrocortisone. Moreover, In June 2020, The RECOVERY Outcome trial results showed that Dexamethasone 6mg for 10 days reduces the death by one third in hospitalised patient with severe respiratory complications of COVID-19. Dexamethasone 6mg is 12 times the physiological required steroid dose, this is equivalent to 240mg hydrocortisone, which is adequate for steroid replacement in patients with adrenal insufficiency or suppression. Conclusion: In view of these results and the outcome of the RECOVERY Trial, Local trust guidelines updated, indicated that any patient with Adrenal insufficiency or suppression including those on long term steroids very unwell admitted to the hospital should receive Dexamethasone if requiring oxygen or Hydrocortisone if not requiring oxygen. Recommendation of changes included teaching sessions delivered to doctors, posters on updated guidelines distributed in major areas in hospital and trust guidelines updated on the intranet.","Haddad, Aiman",J Endocr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8090352/,754
52581,Betamethasone/dexamethasone/prednisone: Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia: case report,2021-05-08,"Synthetic glucocorticoids such as Dexamethasone (Dex) are widely prescribed drugs used to treat a variety of human diseases including auto-immune disorders, asthma, cancer, and COVID-19. The transcriptional response to glucocorticoids is elicited by the Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR), which enters the nucleus upon Dex treatment and interacts with thousands of enhancer elements throughout the genome. We recently demonstrated that the Dex response in human breast cancer cells is highly heterogeneous and that individual cells have unique transcriptional responses to Dex. To examine whether this heterogeneity arises from differential utilization of distinct GR-bound enhancers, we focused on the Dex response at the DNA Damage Inducible Transcript 4 (DDIT4) gene. Using a variety of genomic techniques, we identified four GR binding sites (GBSs) 18-30kb upstream of the DDIT4 TSS with differential patterns of chromatin accessibility, histone acetylation, SWI/SNF recruitment, and enhancer RNA (eRNA) transcription. To determine whether these GBSs had unique requirements for DDIT4 transcription, we used CRISPR-CAS9 to generate homozygous deletions of each site. Using ChIP-seq, 4C-seq, single molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization (smFISH), and RT-PCR, we demonstrated GR binding to these GBSs was independent and each GBS deletion had unique effects on DDIT4 and eRNA transcription, local histone acetylation, and chromatin looping. Deletion of any of the first three GBSs resulted in delayed and/or decreased induction of DDIT4 transcription whereas deletion of the fourth GBS resulted in significant upregulation of both DDIT4 and eRNA transcription. Thus, three of the GBSs acted as enhancers of DDIT4 expression while the fourth functioned as a suppressor. Strikingly, smFISH also revealed that these enhancers contributed to cellular heterogeneity, as deleting the GBSs altered the frequency and amplitude of DDIT4 transcription across cell populations. Taken together, these results demonstrate that individual GBSs uniquely contribute to cell-to-cell heterogeneity within the transcriptional response of DDIT4 to Dex. Furthermore, they underscore the possibility that targeted modification of individual GBSs could be utilized to tailor custom, patient-specific strategies for the treatment of human diseases.","Hoffman, Jackson Andrew; Trotter, Kevin W; Day, Christopher R; Ward, James M; Rodriguez, Joseph; Archer, Trevor K",J Endocr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8090539/,754

Level-2 PPE is worn in our orthopaedic theatres, with increased time taken for simple tasks due to claustrophobia, excessive heat, and difficulties in communication due to masks, including donning and doffing. We sought to determine the impact of Covid-19 on theatre utility. METHOD: 8week period during Covid-19 was reviewed for semi-elective orthopaedic surgery. Pre-Covid-19 case controls for age, procedure and ASA were identified. Electronic database was used to determine total time in theatre complex, time taken for anaesthesia, total procedure time, and time taken for patient to leave the theatre. RESULTS: 27patients undergoing semi-elective surgery during Covid-19 pandemic and 27-matched controls from before pandemic were identified. No statistically significant difference in procedural or anaesthetic time. Significant difference in time interval between cases (14minutes pre-Covid-19 v 58minutes during Covid-19; p < 0.05). Mean theatre start times are 51minutes later during Covid-19. CONCLUSIONS: Procedural times of surgery have not significantly increased, however the time between cases has increased; resulting in a decrease in overall theatre complex utility and direct impact on future costing.","Luney, C; Little, C",Br J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135798/,754
53408,Hyaluronic acid: Delayed type hypersensitivity: case report,2021-05-22,"INTRODUCTION: Acute epistaxis can be a life-threatening airway emergency. Therefore, the majority of patients in whom conservative management (including cautery) has failed are admitted. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our management has shifted towards a more outpatient centred approach. METHOD: A single centre retrospective study was undertaken of all epistaxis patients managed by the ENT team at our centre over a five-month period from 1(st) January to 31(st) May 2020. The first 10 weeks (Pre-COVID-19) were managed using pre-existing guidelines. The following 10 weeks (COVID-19) were managed using the new COVID-19 standard operating procedures which aimed to minimise inpatient admissions. RESULTS: 142 patients, with similar demographic data, were seen across the 5-month period. There were significantly more patients aged over 65 presenting in the COVID-19 group (p = 0.04). There was a significantly increased use of local haemostatic agents (Nasopore ® and Surgiflo ®) and decreased use of nasal packing in the COVID-19 group. There were significantly fewer admissions (p < 0.0005) in the COVID-19 group, but similar rates of representation, length of stay and morbidity. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the shift towards the use of local haemostatic agents and outpatient management of epistaxis, which is as safe and effective as previously well-established epistaxis management.","Devabalan, Y",Br J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135805/,754

METHOD: The IDENTIFY study was an international, prospective, multicentre cohort study of over 11,000 patients referred to secondary care for investigation of haematuria. Using this data, we developed strategies using combinations of imaging and cytology as triage tests to maximise cancer detection within a pragmatic pathway. RESULTS: 8112 patients (74·4%) received an ultrasound or a CT urogram, with or without cytology. 5737 (70·7%) patients had visible haematuria (VH) and 2375 (29·3%) had non-visible haematuria (NVH). Diagnostic test performance was used to determine optimal age cut-offs for four proposed strategies. We recommended proceeding directly to transurethral resection of bladder tumour for patients of any age with positive triage tests for cancer. Patients with negative triage tests under 35-years-old with VH, or under 50-years-old with NVH can safely be discharged without undergoing flexible cystoscopy. The remaining patients may undergo flexible cystoscopy, with a greater priority for older patients to capture high risk bladder cancer. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest diagnostic strategies in patients with haematuria, which focus on detection of bladder cancer, whilst reducing the burden to healthcare services in a resource-limited setting.","Khadhouri, S; Gallagher, K; MacKenzie, K; Shah, T; Gao, C; Moore, S; Zimmermann, E; Edison, E; Jefferies, M; Nambiar, A; Mannas, M; Lee, T; Marra, G; Gomez Rivas, J; Marcq, G; Assmus, M; Ucar, T; Claps, F; Boltri, M; Montagna, G La; Burnhope, T; Nkwam, N; Austin, T; Boxall, N; Downey, A; Sukhu, T; Anton-Juanilla, M; Rai, S; Chin, Y F; Moore, M; Drake, T; Green, J; Nielsen, M; Takwoingi, Y; McGrath, J; Kasivisvanathan, V",Br J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135806/,754

This survey was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of VL amongst medical students in the UK. METHOD: An online anonymised SurveyMonkey© survey was distributed through social media amongst UK medical students. RESULTS: There were 142 completed surveys, 96.5% of students engaged in some form of VL during the pandemic, compared to 57.8% prior to the pandemic. The most frequently used method to deliver teaching was interactive online lectures (74.7%). The students perceived small group online teaching sessions to be the most effective delivery method (weighted average 7.4/10) followed by interactive online lectures (7.4/10). The least effective teaching method was online lecture notes (5.3/10). Accessibility to coursework (8.6/10) and enhanced flexibility (8.4/10) were considered to be the biggest advantages of VL. Overall, 44% of students felt VL had a negative impact on their learning, with 23% of students considered to have failed to meet the learning objectives set out in these sessions. CONCLUSIONS: Beyond the COVID-19 pandemic VL will continue to play a role in medical education. However, there is room for improvement in both delivery and engagement to improve student experience and satisfaction.","Jayawardena, O; Toh, S; Fowler, H; Fok, M; Clifford, R",Br J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135813/,754
53431,Remdesivir: Profound bradycardia: case report,2021-05-22,"INTRODUCTION: We aimed to identify motivators and barriers to volunteering during a disaster and knowledge and medical school curriculum of disaster and pandemic medicine. METHOD: We systematically searched the literature on 28/6/2020, following PRISMA guidelines. RESULTS: A total of 37 studies met inclusion criteria including 11,168 medical students and 91 medical schools. 24 studies evaluated knowledge (64.9%), 16 evaluated volunteering (43.2%), and five evaluated medical school curricula (13.5%). Weighted mean willingness to volunteer during a disaster was 68.4% (SD = 21.7%, n = 2911), and there was a significant difference between those planning to volunteer and those who actually volunteered (P<.001). We identified a number of modifiable barriers which may contribute to this difference. Overall, knowledge of disasters was poor with a weighted mean of 48.9% (SD = 15.1%, n = 2985). CONCLUSIONS: There is a large number of students who are willing to volunteer during pandemics. However, they are likely to be under-prepared for these roles due to poor overall knowledge and limited teaching. During the current COVID-19 pandemic and in future disasters, medical students may be required to volunteer as auxiliary staff. Medical schools need to develop infrastructure to facilitate this process as well as providing education and training to ensure students are adequately prepared for these roles.","Byrne, M; Ashcroft, J; Alexander, L; Wan, J; Harvey, A",Br J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135845/,754

54325,Lisdexamfetamine: Bilateral acute angle closure: case report,2021-06-12,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: A large percentage of patients with neuroblastoma relapse and die, despite treatment, thus demanding new personalized strategies and therapeutic targets. Hypoxia, a condition of reduced oxygenation in several solid tumors, has profound effects on the neuroblastoma (NB) tumor biology and patient prognosis. Establishing new connections between hypoxia and pharmacological compounds may provide novel treatment strategies for NB patients. In the present study, we successfully identified 19 compounds mainly belonging to the class of PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors, whose anti-hypoxia effect was shown on the gene expression profile of nine distinct cell lines using connectivity map software. We independently confirmed these findings on NB cells cultured under hypoxia conditions and treated with the mTORC inhibitor PP242. PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors represent a potential effective class of compounds targeting hypoxia in neuroblastoma. PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors may thus find future applicability as a new adjuvant therapy in randomized clinical trials involving neuroblastoma patients with hypoxic tumors. ABSTRACT: Neuroblastoma (NB) is one of the deadliest pediatric cancers, accounting for 15% of deaths in childhood. Hypoxia is a condition of low oxygen tension occurring in solid tumors and has an unfavorable prognostic factor for NB. In the present study, we aimed to identify novel promising drugs for NB treatment. Connectivity Map (CMap), an online resource for drug repurposing, was used to identify connections between hypoxia-modulated genes in NB tumors and compounds. Two sets of 34 and 21 genes up- and down-regulated between hypoxic and normoxic primary NB tumors, respectively, were analyzed with CMap. The analysis reported a significant negative connectivity score across nine cell lines for 19 compounds mainly belonging to the class of PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors. The gene expression profiles of NB cells cultured under hypoxic conditions and treated with the mTORC complex inhibitor PP242, referred to as the Mohlin dataset, was used to validate the CMap findings. A heat map representation of hypoxia-modulated genes in the Mohlin dataset and the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed an opposite regulation of these genes in the set of NB cells treated with the mTORC inhibitor PP242. In conclusion, our analysis identified inhibitors of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway as novel candidate compounds to treat NB patients with hypoxic tumors and a poor prognosis.","Uva, Paolo; Bosco, Maria Carla; Eva, Alessandra; Conte, Massimo; Garaventa, Alberto; Amoroso, Loredana; Cangelosi, Davide",Cancers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8200206/,754

54970,Meropenem: Leucopenia: case report,2021-06-26,"BACKGROUND: Long-term survival is still low for high-risk patients with soft tissue sarcoma treated with standard management options, including surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Immunotherapy is a promising new potential treatment paradigm. However, the application of immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of patients with sarcoma did not yield promising results in a clinical trial. Therefore, there is a considerable need to identify factors that may lead to immune checkpoint inhibitor resistance. METHODS: In this study, we performed a bioinformatic analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to detect key long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that were correlated with immune checkpoint inhibitory molecules in sarcoma. The expression levels of these lncRNAs and their correlation with patient prognosis were explored. The upstream long noncoding RNAs were also examined via 450K array data from the TCGA. The potential roles of these lncRNAs were further examined via KEGG and GO analysis using DAVID online software. Finally, the relationship between these lncRNAs and immune cell infiltration in tumors and their effect on immune checkpoint inhibitors were further explored. RESULTS: We identified lncRNAs correlated with tumor cell immune evasion in sarcoma. The expression of these lncRNAs was upregulated and correlated with worse prognosis in sarcoma and other human cancer types. Moreover, low DNA methylation occupation of these lncRNA loci was detected. Negative correlations between DNA methylation and lncRNA expression were also found in sarcoma and other human cancer types. KEGG and GO analyses indicated that these lncRNAs correlated with immune evasion and negative regulation of the immune response in sarcoma. Finally, high expression of these lncRNAs correlated with more suppressive immune cell infiltration and reduced sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors in sarcoma and other human cancer types. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that long noncoding RNAs confer immune checkpoint inhibitor resistance in human cancer. Further characterization of these lncRNAs may help to elucidate the mechanisms underlying immune checkpoint inhibitor resistance and uncover a novel therapeutic intervention point for immunotherapy.","Pang, Boran; Hao, Yongqiang",Front Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8226247/,754

The 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and metabolomics approaches were used to investigate the difference in microbes and metabolites in saliva of the control and halitosis groups. The profiles of microbiota and metabolites were relatively different between the halitosis and control groups. The relative abundances of Prevotella, Alloprevotella, and Megasphaera were significantly higher in the halitosis group. In contrast, the relative abundances of Streptococcus, Rothia, and Haemophilus were considerably higher in the control group. The levels of 5-aminovaleric acid and n-acetylornithine were significantly higher in the halitosis group.

The Covid crisis has shown that the use of technology is sometimes the only way to provide access to education, but despite the potential of technology to organize synchronous and asynchronous learning, there are still many problems in using technology, both in terms of just sending students materials to learn by e-mail and also with the initial inflexibility of the learning process. For instance, synchronous online classes were organized for students according to the traditional agenda of classes without thinking about the students’ ability to focus on on-screen activities for many hours and, after that, to do independent work.","Daniela, Linda",Tech Know Learn,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8227361/,754

Since online preschool education is large‐scale and time‐sensitive, the traditional network model cannot satisfy the needs of online education. In this paper, edge computing is adopted to optimize online preschool education, where a task unloading algorithm based on genetic algorithm (TUOGA) is designed to minimize the computing delay of terminal tasks. In order to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm, TUOGA is compared with two task offloading algorithms, and simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms them in the aspect of time latency.","Duan, Xiaoxuan",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8250266/,754

A review of related literature for this paper includes an early perspective of online education, emergent trends, methods used to support educators and learners and a summary of best practices and opportunities for educators. Transitioning courses from on‐ground to online education requires a student‐centered approach, a clear understanding of the objectives, and a plan to address each of the learning goals. Remote learning does not equate to a less rigorous learning experience, instead the online delivery will provide opportunities for synchronous and asynchronous interactions, and will require students to complete assignments and projects to demonstrate comprehension and mastery of the subject matter. Educators, administrators, institutional leaders may find insights into the merits of employing best practices in online education.","Camacho, Danielle J.; Legare, Jill M.",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8250315/,754

It uses students' responses from survey questions and the difference in the average assessment grades between pre‐lockdown and post‐lockdown at a South African university. We find that students' performance was positively associated with good wifi access, relative to using mobile internet data. We also observe lower academic performance for students who found transitioning to online difficult and who expressed a preference for self‐study (i.e. reading through class slides and notes) over assisted study (i.e. joining live lectures or watching recorded lectures). The findings suggest that improving digital infrastructure and reducing the cost of internet access may be necessary for mitigating the impact of the Covid‐19 pandemic on education outcomes.","Chisadza, Carolyn; Clance, Matthew; Mthembu, Thulani; Nicholls, Nicky; Yitbarek, Eleni",Afr Dev Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8250490/,754

55685,Metyrapone: Various toxicities: case report,2021-07-10,"Driving behavior in a highway tunnel could be affected by external environmental factors like light, traffic flow, and acoustic environments, significantly when these factors suddenly change at the moment before and after entering a tunnel. It will cause tremendous physiological pressure on drivers because of the reduction of information and the narrow environment. The risks in driving behavior will increase, making drivers more vulnerable than driving on the regular highways. This research focuses on the usually neglected acoustic environment and its effect on drivers' physiological state and driving behavior. Based on the SIMLAB driving simulation platform of a highway tunnel, 45 drivers participated in the experiment. Five different sound scenarios were tested: original highway tunnel sound and a mix of it with four other sounds (slow music, fast music, voice prompt, and siren, respectively). The subjects' physiological state and driving behavior data were collected through heart rate variability (HRV) and electroencephalography (EEG). Also, vehicle operational data, including vehicle speed, steering wheel angle, brake pedal depth, and accelerator pedal depth, were collected. The results indicated that different sound scenarios in the highway tunnel showed significant differences in vehicle speed (p = 0.000, η(2) = 0.167) and steering wheel angle (p = 0.007, η(2) = 0.126). At the same time, they had no significant difference in HRV and EEG indicators. According to the results, slow music was the best kind of sound related to driving comfort, while the siren sound produced the strongest driver reaction in terms of mental alertness and stress level. The voice-prompt sound most likely caused driver fatigue and overload, but it was the most effective sound affecting safety. The subjective opinion of the drivers indicated that the best sound scenario for the overall experience was slow music (63%), followed by fast music (21%), original highway tunnel sound environment (13%), and voice-prompt sound (3%). The findings of this study will be valuable in improving acoustic environment quality and driving safety in highway tunnels.","Yang, Yanqun; Feng, Yang; Easa, Said M.; Yang, Xiujing; Liu, Jiang; Lin, Wei",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8260679/,754

Previous studies have shown that differences in race, gender, and income level have been associated with avoidable ED visits. Broward County, Florida, is diverse with people from many different socioeconomic backgrounds. The objective of this study is to determine the impact that race/ethnicity, gender, and payment methods have on the rates of avoidable ED visits at hospitals in Broward County, Florida. Methods This study utilized a dataset from the Broward Regional Health Planning Council that included ED visits in Broward County in 2019. Secondary data analysis was conducted utilizing a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post-hoc analysis to compare the proportions of non-emergent, emergent primary care-treatable, and emergent preventable ED visits amongst different race/ethnicities, genders, and payment/insurance methods. Results Compared to non-Hispanic white patients, non-Hispanic black and Hispanic patients had higher mean rates of non-emergent ED visits. Women had greater mean rates compared to men for non-emergent ED visits; males had higher mean rates than females for emergent primary care-treatable and emergent preventable. Patients covered by Medicaid had greater mean rates of non-emergent and emergent primary care-treatable visits compared to patients using other payment or insurance methods. Conclusions This study identified demographics within Broward County associated with avoidable ED visits. To reduce the burden of ED overutilization on the healthcare system, healthcare providers must better educate the at-risk populations about proper ED use. In addition, a comprehensive assessment of social determinants of health in patients overutilizing the ED will allow for better alignment of resources and policy changes to improve healthcare access and community health.","Williams, Caitlin A; Haffizulla, Farzanna",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8272918/,754

The regression results show that the degree of prudence taken by the lending platform in the pre-screening activity negatively affects the detection of some misreporting borrowers.

Therefore, in pediatric diabetology the use of at least one technical device is standard. Both devices can also be combined to form automated insulin delivery (AID) systems. Many AID systems have been tested in clinical trials and have proven to be safe and effective. The supply situation in Germany currently only allows one system to be prescribed for people insured by the statutory health insurances. Currently, children younger than 7 years of age cannot be treated with this system. The reasons for this are legal hurdles and lack of certification by the manufacturers. The CE certification can also lead to problems with insulin prescriptions. Open-source systems are non-regulated variants to circumvent existing regulatory conditions. There are risks here for both users and prescribers. For permanent use a thorough knowledge of the features of each AID system is necessary for both the user and the practitioner. Complete automation does not yet work. For the evaluation of the AID treatment, the metric data of the glucose sensors, the time in range and the glucose management index are the recognized and suitable parameters, because they allow a consultation based on real data from the daily life of people with diabetes. As all glucose sensors are read out via cloud-based software or the data are obtained directly and automatically from a telephone-linked receiver device, this provides the ideal technical basis for telemedical care, which still needs to be configured.","Biester, T.; Dovc, K.; Chobot, A.; Tauschmann, M.; Kapellen, T.",Monatsschr Kinderheilkd,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8276231/,754

Unlike traditional text streams, short text stream data present the following characteristics: short length, weak signal, high volume, high velocity, topic drift, etc. Existing methods cannot simultaneously address two major problems very well: inferring the number of topics and topic drift. Therefore, we propose a dynamic clustering algorithm for short text streams based on the Dirichlet process (DCSS), which can automatically learn the number of topics in documents and solve the topic drift problem of short text streams. To solve the sparsity problem of short texts, DCSS considers the correlation of the topic distribution at neighbouring time points and uses the inferred topic distribution of past documents as a prior of the topic distribution at the current moment while simultaneously allowing newly streamed documents to change the posterior distribution of topics. We conduct experiments on two widely used datasets, and the results show that DCSS outperforms existing methods and has better stability.","Xu, Wanyin; Li, Yun; Qiang, Jipeng",Appl Intell,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8313119/,754

However, its powers have been updated in relatively recent times. Similarly, the EU has promoted in the post-Kyoto Protocol environmental issues with a leading by example approach and implementing an ambitious plan to decarbonize the economy with the energy transition and emission limitation through a market instrument, the emission trading system. The European emissions trading system has been the most ambitious management of negative externalities related to GHG set-up at the international level. The EU now considers that the costs of ecological industrial transition could limit the ability of European industries to compete in the globalized market with industries not subject to similar limits and costs. The EU intends to adopt a carbon adjustment tax at the border, to limit the phenomenon of reallocation and compensate for environmental costs. This paper analyses the various proposals and their advantages and disadvantages. The focus is on the charge on emissions mechanism, which is one of the three proposals the European Economic and Social Committee suggested to the European Commission for further investigation in view of the current competitive asymmetry now recognized by the EU Commission itself. The charge on emissions would value industrial emissions directly within the VAT and use the blockchain to track the emissive supply chain of products.","Gerbeti, Agime",Glob J Flex Syst Manag,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8363487/,754

Disseminated sepsis being a systemic disorder with multisystem involvement, overshadows the timely recognition of bone and joint infections. Hence, we did this cross sectional study to evaluate the prevalence of septic arthritis and osteomyelitis in disseminated sepsis in children, the organisms implicated, and their antibiotic sensitivities. METHODS: We prospectively collected data from 1st July 2016 to 31st September 2017 of children aged less than 12 years with disseminated sepsis, i.e., patients with fever and two or more sites of focal infection of anatomically non-contiguous tissues. RESULTS: Fifty-four patients of disseminated disease were included, of which 25 patients (46.3%) had osteoarticular infections. Septic arthritis was seen in 17 patients, and osteomyelitis was seen in 12 patients. The most common joint was hip (41.6%), and the most common bone involved was femur (53.8%). Blood culture showed MRSA in 28% and MSSA in 20%. Joint and bone aspirates showed S. aureus in 56% with 28% of MRSA and MSSA each. All Staphylococcus aureus organisms were found sensitive to vancomycin and teicoplanin. The mean values of CRP, duration of stay and duration of intravenous antibiotic was higher in MRSA infected patients compared to MSSA patients. CONCLUSIONS: Staphylococcus aureus is the most prevalent organism in musculoskeletal infection in disseminated sepsis children, with vancomycin sensitivity of 100% and methicillin sensitivity of 46.2% only. Cases of osteoarticular involvement with MRSA were higher compared to MSSA among the cases of disseminated disease. The prevalence of osteoarticular involvement is high in disseminated sepsis in children and increased clinical suspicion for such must be maintained.","Sodavarapu, Praveen; Sudesh, Pebam; Gopinathan, Nirmal Raj; Jayashree, Muralidharan; Kumar, Praveen; Rangasamy, Karthick",Indian J Orthop,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8380016/,754

DESIGN: A retrospective, observational, multicenter cohort study. SETTING: A total of 307 patients without propensity score matching and 186 adult inpatients with propensity score matching diagnosed with hypertension and moderate-severe pulmonary acute respiratory distress syndrome in five teaching hospitals in Jiangsu province, China, from December 2015 to December 2020 were enrolled. PATIENTS: A total of 307 patients without propensity score matching and 186 patients with propensity score matching diagnosed with hypertension and moderate-severe pulmonary acute respiratory distress syndrome were included in the final analysis. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Demographic characteristics and clinical characteristics were recorded. The propensity score matching method was used to eliminate the difference between group with dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker and group without dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. We used univariate and multivariate regression analyses for both patients with or without propensity score matching to assess the effect of these variables on mortality. In the subset of 186 patients with propensity score matching, in-hospital mortality was 53.2%. Inpatient mortality was significantly higher in patients treated with dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker than in those not treated with dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker of patients without propensity score matching (65.4% vs 40.4%; p < 0.01). Multivariate analysis for patients without propensity score matching showed that dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (hazard ratio, 1.954; 95% CI, 1.415–2.699), lactate dehydrogenase greater than or equal to 600 U/L (hazard ratio, 3.809; 95% CI, 2.106–4.531), and lactate greater than or equal to 2 mmol/L (hazard ratio, 1.454; 95% CI, 1.041–2.029) were independently associated with in-hospital mortality. Based on univariate analysis for patients with propensity score matching, dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (hazard ratio, 2.021; 95% CI, 1.333–3.064), lactate dehydrogenase greater than or equal to 600 U/L (hazard ratio, 4.379; 95% CI, 2.642–7.257), and lactate greater than or equal to 2 mmol/L (hazard ratio, 2.461; 95% CI, 1.534–3.951) were independently associated with in-hospital mortality. In contrast, patients not treated with dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker had a significant survival advantage over those treated with dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker in both patients without or with propensity score matching (p < 0.001; p = 0.001 by Kaplan-Meier analysis). CONCLUSIONS: Dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, lactate dehydrogenase greater than or equal to 600 U/L, and lactate greater than or equal to 2 mmol/L at admission were independent risk factors for patients with hypertension and moderate-severe pulmonary acute respiratory distress syndrome.","Li, Fengyuan; Gao, Chang; Chen, Jiahao; Yang, Ling; Guo, Shiqi; Jin, Dongmei; Lu, Xiaoting; Sheng, Yin; Ji, Xiaoxia; Guo, Qiang",Crit Care Explor,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8425825/,754

57864,Multiple drugs: COVID-19 infection and lack of efficacy: 8 case reports,2021-09-18,"Climate change is very present in public debates (again), at the latest since the Fridays for Future protests. This manifested recently in the intensity of societal controversies in which, for example, the coal phase-out was negotiated. At the same time, local conflicts over specific energy projects are on the rise. Energy conflicts are particularly acute, among other reasons, because they often form focal points for disputes over the recognition of certain interests as legitimate common good interests. These conflicts are first and foremost a reaction to the design of the energy transition and, at the same time, have an impact on it. In addition, these conflicts are in a reciprocal relationship with the political culture of a society. They are both an effect and a co-producer of the ideas of democracy negotiated in society. This article makes a twofold contribution to the analysis of common good conflicts in the German energy transition. First, empirical results of energy transition research are interpreted with regard to the struggles over the definition and prioritization of common good goals of the energy transition. A key observation is that energy conflicts reveal phenomena of a crisis of democracy that cannot be adequately addressed in negotiations over concrete energy projects. Second, the findings on common good conflicts in the energy transition are discussed in the light of democratic theory. It is argued that the lack of willingness (on the part of government policy actors) to engage in conflicts over the prioritization of common good goals of the energy transition is a central deficit. In combination with a one-sided orientation towards the deliberative model of democracy (in the processes of implementing energy projects), this exacerbates the tendencies of a crisis of democracy. From a radical democratic perspective, there is a need for agonistic arenas of dispute in which political opponents compete to implement their respective energy transition visions.","Krüger, Timmo",Z Politikwiss,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8436023/,754

The aim is to identify different factors, which affect creative work from the learners’ point of view. These insights help to design an appropriate digital teaching environment for creative group work. The qualitative and quantitative analysis of learners’ needs revealed three groups of design factors that need special attention in digital learning spaces: (1) functionality and characteristics of the technical tools, (2) psychological values of collaboration and organizational culture, (3) motivation and engagement.","Gebbing, Pia; Yang, Xingyue; Michalke, Simon; Lattemann, Christoph",HMD,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8477360/,754

In this article, we reflect on our experiences of applying active learning methods. We argue that we have been part of a change that has occasioned a loss of key skills development, especially those associated with traditional learning and academic thinking. An overly headlong rush to implement the “new” over the “old” saw the discarding of certain skills central to the active learning agenda. Further, the emphasis on student satisfaction, professionalisation and quality assurance pushed the academic to the sidelines, to the detriment of Higher Education. We, therefore, first critique the skills debate and identify shortcomings in the active learning application that emerged from that debate. We focus on the skills emphasised in practice, how they are portrayed in opposition (instead of complementarity) to academic skills, and how they undermine the agency academics and students really require. Next, we propose a reconsideration of necessary but undervalued skills like reading, listening and note-taking.","David, Maxine; Maurer, Heidi",Eur Polit Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8477978/,754

The central argument presented in the paper is that renewed impetus for national distinction and self-determination in Scotland is best understood as one facet of a much wider popular disenchantment and growing restiveness with the trajectory of contemporary UK politics, culture and society that has found an outlet via a resurgent nationalist discourse and institutional framework. Analysis here is approached via the application of an original biosocial theory with the aim of presenting further insights into the underlying processes driving contemporary political instability. Moreover, it is argued that this scenario can be understood, and may shed light upon, the wider rise in nationalist and populist sentiment that is contributing to increasing political turbulence across Europe and beyond.","Bone, John",Br Polit,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8478637/,754

Differentiation status of infused T cells is a crucial parameter for their persistence and antitumor immunity. Key phenotypic molecules are effective and efficient to analyze differentiation status. Differentiation status is crucial for T cell exhaustion, in-vivo lifespan, antitumor immunity, and even antitumor pharmacological interventions. Strategies including cytokines, Akt, Wnt and Notch signaling, epigenetics, and metabolites have been developed to produce less differentiated T cells. Clinical trials have shown better clinical outcomes from infusion of T cells with less differentiated phenotypes. CD27+, CCR7+ and CD62L+ have been the most clinically relevant phenotypic molecules, while Tscm and Tcm the most clinically relevant subtypes. Currently, CD27+, CD62L+ and CCR7+ are recommended in the differentiation phenotype to evaluate strategies of enhancing stemness.

This cross-sectional study sought to measure the point prevalence levels of depression in university students (ages 19–25 years) from Maharashtra, India, during the peak of the first wave of the pandemic and lockdown, through an online opt-in survey. The BDI-II was self-administered by 783 respondents (males = 243; females = 540). Results indicated overall mild levels of depression (mean BDI = 16.48) and high point prevalence, with 51.8% (n = 406) of the population being symptomatic, of which 16.3% had severe, 17.9% had moderate, and 17.8% had mild levels of depression. No association was found with age, gender, educational level of participants, period of hostel stay, education, and occupational level of parents. Overall percentages of symptomatic women were higher, suggesting the gendered effects of the pandemic. This study explored the symptomatology of depression wherein “sadness,” “changes in sleep patterns,” and “concentration difficulties” emerged as the most commonly experienced symptoms. Symptom expression was found to vary with intensity and gender. Symptomatic men experienced significantly more cognitive symptoms like self-criticalness, punishment feelings, thoughts about past failures, and changes in sleep patterns, while symptomatic women felt significantly high “loss of energy.” No significant gender differences were seen in the experience of cognitive-affective symptoms.

METHODS: We analyzed Spring 2020 data from a longitudinal study of young adults (ages 18–34) across 6 metropolitan areas (Atlanta, Boston, Minneapolis, Oklahoma City, San Diego, and Seattle). We examined tobacco/e-cigarette use and self-reported appeal of various intervention approaches, and regarding technology-based approaches, the appeal of types of technology and intervention functions. RESULTS: In this sample of past 6-month tobacco/e-cigarette users (M(age) = 24.69; 48.4% male; 73.3% White), 59.6% used e-cigarettes, and 48.2% used cigarettes. The most frequently endorsed intervention approach was nicotine replacement therapy (NRT; 72.7%), followed by technology-based programs (70.0%) and oral medications (53.0%). The most frequently endorsed technology-based approach was smartphone apps (85.9%), followed by programs involving text-messaging (62.1%), websites (57.1%), social media (48.4%), and video counseling (41.6%). The most frequently endorsed technology-based program function was behavioral monitoring (68.3%), followed by earning rewards (60.3%). We identified no differences in approach appeal among subcategories of tobacco/e-cigarette users. CONCLUSIONS: Findings underscore the promise of technology-based approaches, particularly apps, and text-messaging for tobacco/e-cigarette cessation, and functions like behavioral monitoring and gamification. Additionally, appropriate and effective NRT use for young-adult tobacco/e-cigarette users warrants further research.","Berg, Carla J; Romm, Katelyn F; Patterson, Brooke; Wysota, Christina; Abroms, Lorien C",Tob Use Insights,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8516370/,754

Definitive diagnosis of PE is confirmed by computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA). METHODS This was a prospective study on 80 patients referred to the Institute for Pulmonary Diseases of Vojvodina with suspected PE between April 2010 and August 2012. Clinical probability of PE was determined according to the Wells and modified Wells scoring system. CTPA was performed in 60 patients. The degree of pulmonary vascular obstruction was quantified by the Qanadli index. RESULTS Low clinical probability of PE was present in one patient (1.6%), moderate in 43 (71.6%) and high in 16 (26.6%) patients. PE was confirmed in 50 (83.3%) patients. There were 21 patients (42%) whose Quanadli index was <25%, 18 (36%) between 25%-50%, while Quanadli index was ≥50 in 11 patients (22%). When compared to CTPA findings, modified Wells scoring system showed 90% sensitivity [95% confidence interval (CI) 78.2%-96.6%], and 20% specificity (95% CI 3.11%-55.6%), positive predictive value (PPV) 84.9% (95% CI 72.4%-93.2%) and negative predictive value (NPV) 28.6% (95% CI 4.5%-70.7%). There was weak positive correlation between Wells score and Quanadli index (r = 0.14; P = 0.29), without statistical significance. Wells score was significantly higher in haemodynamically unstable than in haemodynamically stable patients (6.8 vs 5.6, P = 0.014). There was no statistically significant difference between the values of Quanadli index in these two groups (31.33% vs 26.64%, P = 0.062). CONCLUSION Modified Wells criteria have high sensitivity but low specificity in PE diagnostics. The Wells score does not correlate well with the Quanadli index.","Obradović, Dušanka; Joveš, Biljana; Pena Karan, Slobodanka; Stefanović, Srdjan; Ivanov, Igor; Vukoja, Marija",The clinical respiratory journal,https://doi.org/10.1111/crj.12291; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25763885/,754

Evidence is lacking on the effects of online contraceptive service use on short-term contraceptive continuation. METHODS Cohort study comparing contraceptive continuation between new users of a free-to-access online OC service in South East London with those from other, face-to-face services in the same area. Online questionnaires collected data on participants' sociodemographic characteristics, motivations for OC access, service ratings, OC knowledge and contraceptive use. Contraceptive use in the 4-month study period was measured using health service records. Unadjusted and multivariable logistic regression models compared outcomes between the online service group and those using other services. RESULTS Online service-users (n=138) were more likely to experience short-term continuation of OCs compared with participants using other services (n=98) after adjusting for sociodemographic and other characteristics (adjusted OR 2.94, 95% CI 1.52 to 5.70). Online service-users rated their service more highly (mean 25.22, SD 3.77) than the other services group (mean 22.70, SD 4.35; p<0.001), valuing convenience and speed of access. Among progestogen-only pill users, knowledge scores were higher for the online group (mean 4.83, SD 1.90) than the other services group (mean 3.87, SD 1.73; p=0.007). Among combined oral contraceptive users, knowledge scores were similar between groups. CONCLUSIONS Free-to-access, online contraception has the potential to improve short-term continuation of OCs.

The use of HH technologies is increasing and studies examining the success of these technologies on HH compliance and HAIs are important to inform standards of care. COVID-19 has emphasized compliance HH standards. METHODS This study evaluated HH compliance and Clostridium difficile (C-difficile) rates following implementation of an HH technology at a long-term acute care hospital. The HH technology required nursing and other staff with direct patient contact to wear a ""badge"" that measured alcohol concentration on a health care worker's hands or time washing hands at designated sinks upon exit/entry of patient rooms. No changes were made to environmental cleaning or antibiotic stewardship standards. Compliance and infection rates were compared 12 months pre-post implementation during 2017-2019. RESULTS There was an increase in HH compliance (89.82% to 97.10%, p <0.001)) and a reduction in the incidence of C-difficile (9.541 to 3.720, p = 0.0032).

Considering the virus' zoonotic potential, its genome nature (segmented RNA virus), its worldwide circulation in livestock, and its role in bovine respiratory disease, an increased interest is given to IDV. However, few data are available on drivers of emergence of IDV. We first listed fifty possible drivers of emergence of IDV in ruminants and swine. As recently carried out for COVID19 in pets (Saegerman e,t al, 2020b), a scoring system was developed per driver and scientific experts (N = 28) were elicited to: (i) allocate a score to each driver, (ii) weight the drivers scores within each domain and (iii) weight the different domains among themselves. An overall weighted score was calculated per driver; and drivers were ranked in decreasing order. Drivers with comparable likelihoods to play a role in the emergence of IDV in ruminants and swine in Europe were grouped using a regression tree analysis. Finally, the robustness of the expert elicitation was verified. Eight drivers were ranked with the highest probability to play a key role in the emergence of IDV: current species specificity of the causing agent of the disease; influence of (il)legal movements of live animals (ruminants, swine) from neighbouring/European Union member states and from Third countries for the disease to (re-)emerge in a given country; detection of emergence; current knowledge of the pathogen; vaccine availability; animal density; and transport vehicles of live animals. As there is still limited scientific knowledge on the topic, expert elicitation of knowledge and multi-criteria decision analysis, in addition to clustering and sensitivity analyses, are very important to prioritize future studies, starting from the top eight drivers. The present methodology could be applied to other emerging animal diseases.","Saegerman, Claude; Bianchini, Juana; Snoeck, Chantal J; Moreno, Ana; Chiapponi, Chiara; Zohari, Siamak; Ducatez, Mariette F",Transboundary and emerging diseases,https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.13938; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33249766/,754

Unidirectional barbed sutures have been proposed to simplify wall and mesentery closure, but the results for intestinal anastomosis are not clear. This study aimed to establish the feasibility and the safety of laparoscopic intestinal anastomosis using barbed suture. METHODS Between June 2011 and May 2012, 15-cm-long unidirectional absorbable barbed sutures (V-Loc; Covidien, Mansfield, MA, USA) were used for all laparoscopic intestinal anastomoses: one suture for closure of intestinal openings after mechanical anastomoses and two sutures for hand-sewn anastomoses. RESULTS Over a 1-year period, 201 consecutive patients required 220 laparoscopic anastomoses for gastrojejunostomy (n = 177; 172 during Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and 5 after gastrectomy), ileocolostomy (n = 15), colocolostomy (n = 1), esophagojejunostomy (n = 5), and jejunojejunostomy (n = 22; 4 after small bowel resection and 18 during gastric bypass or gastrectomy). Senior and training surgeons performed 209 closures of intestinal openings and 11 hand-sewn anastomoses. There was no conversion to usual sutures. One fistula occurred in an esophagojejunostomy and was managed conservatively. One self-limited anastomotic bleeding occurred, and no anastomotic stenosis occurred during 6 months of follow-up evaluation. CONCLUSIONS The use of knotless barbed suture for laparoscopic intestinal anastomosis is safe and reproducible.","Facy, Olivier; De Blasi, Vito; Goergen, Martine; Arru, Luca; De Magistris, Luigi; Azagra, Juan-Santiago",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-013-2992-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23670743/,754

The development of transgenic models and intravital imaging technologies has made it possible to track the cellular dynamics of Bmem reactivation by antigen, their interactions with follicular memory T cells, and differentiation into plasma cells in subcapsular proliferative foci in the lymph nodes of immune animals. Such in situ studies have reinforced the importance of geography in shaping the outcome of the secondary antibody response. We also review the evidence for Bmem reactivation and differentiation into short-lived plasma cells in the pathogenesis of disease flares in relapsing-remitting autoimmune diseases. Elucidating the mechanisms that control the Bmem fate decision to differentiate into plasma cells or germinal center B cells will aid future efforts to more precisely engineer fit-for-purpose vaccines as well as to treat antibody-mediated autoimmune diseases.","Dhenni, Rama; Phan, Tri Giang",Immunological reviews,https://doi.org/10.1111/imr.12862; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32472583/,754

BACKGROUND COVID-19 related social and physical distancing measures increase the risk for individuals who are socially isolated with partners who perpetuate violence. Providing support through telehealth is one strategy that can mitigate the pandemic of IPV, while helping patients and providers stay safe from COVID-19. DESIGN AND METHODS In this discursive paper, we describe how practical guidance for safely recognizing and responding to IPV in telehealth encounters was developed. The ADAPT-ITT (Assessment, Decisions, Administration, Production, Topical Experts, Integration, Testing, Training) framework was used to guide the novel identification and adaptation of evidence-informed. We focused on the first six stages of the ADAPT-ITT framework. CONCLUSIONS This paper fills a gap in available guidance, specifically for IPV recognition and response via telehealth. We present strategies for prioritizing safety and promoting privacy while initiating, managing, or terminating a telehealth encounter with patients who may be at risk for or experiencing IPV. Strategies for assessment, planning, and intervention are also summarized. System level responses, such as increasing equitable access to telecommunication technology are also discussed. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE Integrating innovative IPV-focused practices into telehealth care is an important opportunity for nurses and midwives during the current global COVID-19 pandemic.

It is unclear whether this is driven by an increased risk of infection or complications. We therefore aimed to investigate the incidence of clinically diagnosed influenza/influenza-like illness (ILI) by ethnicity in England from 2008-2018. Methods: We used linked primary and secondary healthcare data (from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink [CPRD] GOLD and Aurum databases and Hospital Episodes Statistics Admitted Patient Care [HES APC]). We included patients with recorded ethnicity who were aged 40-64 years and did not have a chronic health condition that would render them eligible for influenza vaccination. ILI infection was identified from diagnostic codes in CPRD and HES APC. We calculated crude annual infection incidence rates by ethnic group. Multivariable Poisson regression models with random effects were used to estimate any ethnic disparities in infection risk. Our main analysis adjusted for age, sex, and influenza year. Results: A total of 3,735,308 adults aged 40-64 years were included in the study; 87.6% White, 5.2% South Asian, 4.2% Black, 1.9% Other, and 1.1% Mixed. We identified 102,316 ILI episodes recorded among 94,623 patients. The rate of ILI was highest in the South Asian (9.6 per 1,000 person-years), Black (8.4 per 1,000 person-years) and Mixed (6.9 per 1,000 person-years) ethnic groups. The ILI rate in the White ethnic group was 5.7 per 1,000 person-years. After adjustment for age sex and influenza year, higher incidence rate ratios (IRR) for ILI were seen for South Asian (1.70, 95% CI 1.66-1.75), Black (1.48, 1.44-1.53) and Mixed (1.22, 1.15-1.30) groups compared to White ethnicity. Conclusions: Our results suggest that influenza infection risk differs between White and non-White groups who are not eligible for routine influenza vaccination.","Davidson, Jennifer; Banerjee, Amitava; Mathur, Rohini; Ramsay, Mary; Smeeth, Liam; Walker, Jemma; McDonald, Helen; Warren-Gash, Charlotte",Wellcome open research,https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16620.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34056137/,754
114492,Working memory capacity predicts individual differences in social-distancing compliance during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.,2020-07-10,"BACKGROUND Obesity has been considered a relative contraindication to peritoneal dialysis (PD). Surprisingly, PD catheter dysfunction rates and longevity have not been studied in the growing obese ESRD population. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of patient weight on PD catheter survival in the three insertion technique categories of advanced laparoscopy (AL), basic laparoscopy (BL), and open. METHODS We examine retrospectively collected data on 231 consecutive PD catheter insertions at the NorthShore University HealthSystem between 2004 and 2014. Three cohorts were created based on the catheter insertion technique: open, BL using selective adhesiolysis, and AL using rectus sheath tunnel, selective omentopexy, and adhesiolysis. Primary outcomes included catheter dysfunction and catheter dysfunction-free survival for each cohort by BMI: normal weight (18.5-24.9), overweight (25-29.9), obese (≥30). Nominal variables were compared using Chi-square test, continuous variables using ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis tests, and catheter survival was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method with log-rank test. Statistical significance was established at 0.05. RESULTS For the three BMI categories, there were no statistically significant differences in patient demographics. There were no statistically significant differences in catheter dysfunction or peri-operative complications by BMI category among all patients. This was also true in the AL cohort. Among all patients, similar 2-year dysfunction-free catheter survival was noted for normal weight, overweight, and obese patients (log-rank p = 0.79). This was also true across all insertion techniques: open (log-rank p = 0.87), BL (log-rank p = 0.41), AL (log-rank p = 0.43). In the obese cohort, the 2-year dysfunction-free catheter survival was 91.1% in AL, 83.5% in BL, and 65.7% in open (log-rank p = 0.58). CONCLUSION Obesity does not increase complications or shorten dysfunction-free PD catheter survival regardless of the operative technique used. Obesity should not be considered as a relative contraindication to PD catheter placement as it confers similar technique success to normal- and overweight individuals.","Krezalek, Monika A; Bonamici, Nicolas; Kuchta, Kristine; Lapin, Brittany; Carbray, JoAnn; Denham, Woody; Linn, John; Ujiki, Michael; Haggerty, Stephen P",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-017-5852-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28917008/,754

Materials and Methods This study included 306 volunteer adults who applied to our dental clinic for dental interventions during the early days of COVID-19 outbreak in Turkey. All patients responded to a newly created questionnaire composed of four sections with 19 questions those mostly assessing the social and demographic details; like the participant's age, gender, marital status, education status, medical history, basic dental hygiene habits, occupation, and general information about the COVID-19 infection and its protection methods. Results The outcomes of 306 participants revealed that their gender, age, and education status showed significant distinctions about the dissemination of coronavirus via dental interventions. Higher education status was linked to a loftier level of social awareness about the COVID-19 infection and its potential associations with dental interventions. It was observed that the participants were unsatisfactorily cautious against the COVID-19 infection and its dissemination pathways in their social environment, particularly in the specific case of systematic diseases and preventive measures. The primary way of obtaining information about the COVID-19 infection was the electronic websites. Conclusion Deplorably, accentuating the urgent need for further intensive training programs on the relationship between the systemic diseases and COVID-19 infection, and explicit daily care methods in the social environment.","Yilmaz, B; Somay, E",Nigerian journal of clinical practice,https://doi.org/10.4103/njcp.njcp_434_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34018986/,754

126018,Anterior Cranial Fossa Dural Arteriovenous Fistulae - Angioarchitecture and Intervention.,2020-07-14,"The current pandemic of COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) is the critical determinant of viral tropism and infectivity. To investigate whether naturally occurring RBD mutations during the early transmission phase have altered the receptor binding affinity and infectivity, firstly we analyzed in silico the binding dynamics between SARS-CoV-2 RBD mutants and the human ACE2 receptor. Among 32,123 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 isolates (January through March, 2020), 302 non-synonymous RBD mutants were identified and clustered into 96 mutant types. The six dominant mutations were analyzed applying molecular dynamics simulations (MDS). The mutant type V367F continuously circulating worldwide displayed higher binding affinity to human ACE2 due to the enhanced structural stabilization of the RBD beta-sheet scaffold. The MDS also indicated that it would be difficult for bat SARS-like CoV to infect humans. However, the pangolin CoV is potentially infectious to humans. The increased infectivity of V367 mutants was further validated by performing receptor-ligand binding ELISA, surface plasmon resonance, and pseudotyped virus assays. Phylogenetic analysis of the genomes of V367F mutants showed that during the early transmission phase, most V367F mutants clustered more closely with the SARS-CoV-2 prototype strain than the dual-mutation variants (V367F + D614G) which may derivate from recombination. The analysis of critical RBD mutations provides further insights into the evolutionary trajectory of early SARS-CoV-2 variants of zoonotic origin under negative selection pressure and supports the continuing surveillance of spike mutations to aid in the development of new COVID-19 drugs and vaccines. Importance A novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has caused the pandemic of COVID-19. The origin of SARS-CoV-2 was associated with zoonotic infections. The spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) is identified as the critical determinant of viral tropism and infectivity. Thus, whether the mutations in the RBD of the circulating SARS-CoV-2 isolates have altered the receptor binding affinity and made them more infectious, has been the research hotspot. Given that SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus, the significance of our research is in identifying and validating the RBD mutant types emerging during the early transmission phase and increasing human ACE2 receptor binding affinity and infectivity. Our study provides insights into the evolutionary trajectory of early SARS-CoV-2 variants of zoonotic origin. The continuing surveillance of RBD mutations with increased human ACE2 affinity in human or other animals is critical to the development of new COVID-19 drugs and vaccines against these variants during the sustained COVID-19 pandemic.","Ou, Junxian; Zhou, Zhonghua; Dai, Ruixue; Zhang, Jing; Zhao, Shan; Wu, Xiaowei; Lan, Wendong; Ren, Yi; Cui, Lilian; Lan, Qiaoshuai; Lu, Lu; Seto, Donald; Chodosh, James; Wu, Jianguo; Zhang, Gong; Zhang, Qiwei",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00617-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34105996/,754

DESIGN Prospective clinical study. SAMPLES 96 blood samples from 80 dogs and 90 blood samples from 65 cats. PROCEDURES Serum, plasma, and whole blood were obtained from each blood sample. The glucose concentrations in serum, plasma, and whole blood measured by a POCG were compared with the serum glucose concentration measured by a biochemical analyzer by use of the Lin concordance correlation coefficient (ρc) and Bland-Altman plots. RESULTS For both canine and feline samples, glucose concentrations in serum and plasma measured by the POCG were more strongly correlated with the serum glucose concentration measured by the biochemical analyzer (ρc, 0.98 for both canine serum and plasma; ρc, 0.99 for both feline serum and plasma) than was that in whole blood (ρc, 0.62 for canine samples; ρc, 0.90 for feline samples). The mean difference between the glucose concentrations determined by the biochemical analyzer and the POCG in serum, plasma, and whole blood was 0.4, 0.3, and 31 mg/dL, respectively, for canine samples and 7, 6, and 32 mg/dL, respectively, for feline samples.

136232,Comparison of the performance of laboratory tests in the diagnosis of feline infectious peritonitis.,2018,"In 2019, lung cancer was estimated to be the leading cause of cancer deaths in humans. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are known to increase the risk of lung cancer. PAHs are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP)1A subfamily, comprised of the CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 monooxygenases. These enzymes bioactivate PAHs into reactive metabolites that induce mutagenic DNA adducts, which can lead to cancer. Past studies have investigated the role of CYP1A1 in PAH bioactivation; however, the individual roles of each CYP1A enzyme are still unknown. In this investigation, we tested the hypothesis that mice lacking the genes for Cyp1a1 or Cyp1a2 will display altered susceptibilities to PAH-induced pulmonary carcinogenesis. Wild-type (WT), Cyp1a1-null (Cyp1a1-/-), and Cyp1a2-null (Cyp1a2-/-) male and female mice were treated with 3-methylcholanthrene (MC) for cancer initiation and tumor formation studies. In WT mice, CYP1A1 and 1A2 expression was induced by MC. Cyp1a1-/- and Cyp1a2-/- mice treated with PAHs displayed a compensatory pattern, where knocking out one Cyp1a gene led to increased expression of the other. Cyp1a1-/- mice were resistant to DNA adduct and tumor formation, while Cyp1a2-/- mice displayed increased levels of both. UALCAN analysis revealed that lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients with high levels of CYP1A2 expression survive significantly better than patients with low/medium expression. In conclusion, Cyp1a1-/- mice were less susceptible to PAH-induced pulmonary carcinogenesis, while Cyp1a2-/- mice were more susceptible. Additionally, high CYP1A2 expression was found to be protective for LUAD patients. These results support the need to develop novel CYP1A1 inhibitors to mitigate human lung cancer.","Gastelum, Grady; Jiang, Weiwu; Wang, Lihua; Zhou, Guodong; Borkar, Roshan; Putluri, Nagireddy; Moorthy, Bhagavatula",Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology,https://doi.org/10.1093/toxsci/kfaa107; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32726451/,754

MATERIALS AND METHODS From September 2009 to September 2013, seven patients, diagnosed with unilateral adrenal APA and underwent computed tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous RFA, were recruited in this retrospective study. Eighteen unilateral adrenal APA with the same tumor size (<25 mm) who underwent LA during the same interval were enrolled as control group. Treatment success was defined as complete tumor ablation on follow-up CT scan and normalization of serum aldosterone-to-renin ratio. We also compared ""normalization ability"" between RFA group and LA group. Normalization ability was defined as reduction in blood pressure, decrease in number of antihypertensive medicine use, reduction in serum aldosterone, and increase in serum potassium level. RESULTS There was no statistically significant demographic difference in both groups. The mean tumor size was 18 (8-25) mm in RFA and 19 (11-25) mm in LA groups, respectively. There was only one intra-procedure hypertensive crisis in the RFA group. No other complications needed further management in both groups. During an interval of 3-6 months of follow-up, the treatment success rate reached 100 % in the RFA group versus 94.4 % in the LA group. Normalization ability was statistically equivalent in the RFA and the LA group. Comparing with LA group, RFA group demonstrated with less post-operative pain (visual analog scale, 2.0 ± 1.16 vs. 4.22 ± 1.44, p < 0.001) and shorter operative time (105 ± 34 vs. 194 ± 58 min, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS CT-guided percutaneous RFA is effective, safe and is a justifiable alternative for patients who are reluctant or unfit for laparoscopic surgery for the treatment of APA.","Yang, Min-Hsin; Tyan, Yeu-Sheng; Huang, Yu-Hui; Wang, Shao-Chuan; Chen, Sung-Lang",La Radiologia medica,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11547-016-0662-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27300650/,754

The chemical hemispheric-dominance in various systemic and neuropsychiatric diseases was also studied. METHODS The isoprenoid metabolites, digoxin, dolichol and ubiquinone, glycoconjugate metabolism, free radical metabolism and the RBC membrane composition, were studied in individuals with differing hemispheric-dominance. The digoxin levels and RBC membrane Na+-K+ATPase activity were also studied in systemic and neuropsychiatric diseases. RESULTS The results showed that right hemispheric-dominant individuals had elevated digoxin levels, increased free radical production and reduced scavenging, increased tryptophan catabolites and reduced tyrosine catabolites, increased glycoconjugate levels and increased cholesterol : phospholipid ratio of RBC membranes. Left hemispheric-dominant individuals had the opposite patterns. This patterns could be correlated with various systemic and neuropsychiatric diseases. CONCLUSION Right hemispheric-dominance represents a hyperdigoxinaemic state with membrane sodium-potassium ATPase inhibition. Left hemispheric-dominance represents the reverse pattern with hypodigoxinaemia and membrane sodium-potassium ATPase stimulation. Hemispheric-dominance could predispose to various systemic and neuropsychiatric diseases.","Kurup, R K; Kurup, P A",Acta neuropsychiatrica,https://doi.org/10.1034/j.1601-5215.2003.00012.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26984796/,754

A perspective from the United States of America.",2020-05-13,"PURPOSE Total extraperitoneal preperitoneal (TEP) repair is widely used for inguinal, femoral, or obturator hernia treatment. However, mesh repair is not often used for strangulated hernia treatment if intestinal resection is required because of the risk of postoperative mesh infection. Complete mesh repair is required for hernia treatment to prevent postoperative recurrence, particularly in patients with femoral or obturator hernia. CASES We treated four patients with inguinocrural and obturator hernias (a 72-year-old male with a right indirect inguinal hernia; an 83-year-old female with a right obturator hernia; and 86- and 82-year-old females with femoral hernias) via a two-stage laparoscopic surgery. All patients were diagnosed with intestinal obstruction due to strangulated hernia. First, the incarcerated small intestine was released and then laparoscopically resected. Further, 8-24 days after the first surgery, bilateral TEP repairs were performed in all patients; the postoperative course was uneventful in all patients, and they were discharged 5-10 days after TEP repair. At present, no hernia recurrence has been reported in any patient. CONCLUSION The two-stage laparoscopic treatment is safe for treatment of strangulated inguinal, femoral, and obturator hernias, and complete mesh repair via the TEP method can be performed in elderly patients to minimize the occurrence of mesh infection.","Sasaki, A; Takeuchi, Y; Izumi, K; Morimoto, A; Inomata, M; Kitano, S",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-014-1272-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24908448/,754

Staple-line buttressing is largely adopted as an acceptable reinforcement but data regarding leaks have been equivocal. This study compared staple-line leaks in five reinforcement options during LSG: no reinforcement (NO-SLR), oversewing (suture), nonabsorbable bovine pericardial strips (BPS), tissue sealant or fibrin glue (Seal), or absorbable polymer membrane (APM). METHODS This systematic review study of articles published between 2012 and 2016 regarding LSG leak rates aligned with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Variables of interest included leak rates, bleeding, and complications in addition to surgical and population parameters. An independent Fisher's exact test was used to compare the number of patients with and without leaks for the different reinforcement options. RESULTS Of the 1633 articles identified, 148 met inclusion criteria and represented 40,653 patients. Differences in age (older in APM; p = 0.001), starting body mass index (lower in Suture; p = 0.008), and distance from pylorus (closer in BPS; p = 0.04) were observed between groups, but mean bougie size was equivalent. The overall leak rate of 1.5% (607 leaks) ranged from 0.7% for APM (significantly lower than all groups; p ≤ 0.007 for next lowest leak rate) to 2.7% (BPS). CONCLUSIONS This systematic review of staple-line leaks following LSG demonstrated a significantly lower rate using APM staple-line reinforcement as compared to oversewing, use of sealants, BPS reinforcement, or no reinforcement. Variation in surgical technique may also contribute to leak rates.","Gagner, Michel; Kemmeter, Paul",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-019-06782-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30993513/,754

The hypothesis that protein or peptide biomarkers may also be of value in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic appears self-evident. Proteome based biomarkers are not expected to display significant added value in the detection of viral infection but appear well suited to address a major unmet need: the prognosis of the course of disease, to guide appropriate, timely intervention. Based on similar approaches in the context of other diseases and using a CE-MS platform, urinary peptides are investigated for their value as biomarkers to assess disease progression after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The manuscript presented in this issue of Proteomics reports first results, indicating that urine peptides may be of substantial value in the assessment and prediction of severity of the Covid-19 disease course on an individual level. While the findings are not entirely surprising, the report does stand out from all others by a well-defined context-of-use, and, what is more, by presenting an already initiated validation study that may, if successful, result in immediate implementation of this proteomics-based diagnostic test.

Problems and research on the use of artificial intelligence is carried out at the intersection of many scientific fields. Jurisprudence is no exception. In recent years, there has been a tendency to harmonize law in accordance with new challenges and global trends in the development of the information society, which includes the introduction of information and communication technologies into social processes. This causes a change in the system of public relations and the formation of specific branches and sub-branches of law, in particular information or digital law. The Russian Federation, like most modern states, has put forward serious tasks to create a system of legal regulation of artificial intelligence. This issue has become especially urgent in the context of the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, which triggered the expansion of the introduction of artificial intelligence technologies. The authors in the study raise the question of the most important areas of regulation in the use of artificial intelligence, primarily for sustainable economic development in a pandemic as well as for the activation of innovative technological entrepreneurship. The authors analyzed strategic documents and the legal basis for regulating artificial intelligence, science and technology of the digital economy in Russia. Based on the study of foreign practices in regard to normative legal regulation of the digital economy and artificial intelligence, the features of approaches in Europe and East Asia are revealed.

As part of the COVID-19 response, emergency services were temporarily reconfigured to GRH. This was rapidly implemented, to maximise patient safety whilst managing high patient volumes and potentially high levels of staff sickness.In theatres, communication is critical to safe working. Much has been done in our Trust to improve theatre briefings. We aimed to assess how communication in theatres was impacted by changes made to working patterns during COVID-19. A SurveyMonkeyTM collected demographics, and Likert scale responses assessing team working, communication, briefings, and staff well-being. The survey was distributed to all surgical specialties, anaesthetic, and theatre staff. A total of 100 responses were collected over 5 weeks.The survey confirmed that COVID-19 had a significant impact on working structures. 60% of respondents worked in different teams, and 44% felt outside of their comfort zone. 72% found communication more difficult, with 92% attributing this to PPE. The majority (72%) felt briefings covered specific C-19 related issues and they could raise concerns (77%). However, only 26% of respondents felt this was true for emergency briefings. This is the focus of our initial change.We plan to improve briefings whilst re-engaging those stakeholders who were less involved during the early phase of the initial pandemic. Our high volume of emergency work means that we can implement rapid PDSA cycles following focused discussion groups.

185769,Fatal coronavirus infection in puppies following canine parvovirus 2b infection.,1999,"As the world experienced the COVID-19 outbreak, education was one of the multiple systems that were hit hard. We explored the consequences of the reconfiguration of schooling based on the experiences of the educational stakeholders caught up in the sudden transition to virtual schooling during COVID-19. Using Bronfenbrenner’s (1976) Ecological Systems framework, we underscored the complexity of the individual’s socio-cultural world and the myriad influences that impact the individual’s growth to examine how agents involved in the educational system have dealt with this unanticipated crisis academically, personally, socially, and emotionally. People can endorse contradictory positions on the same policy. Recognizing that multiplicity of voices might bring a different perspective, we captured various voices—an administrator leading the teachers’ professional development, a public-school elementary teacher, and a parent with two kids. Using unstructured interviews, we unpacked the narratives and counter-narratives of the participants to unpack “what worked” and “what did not work” during virtual learning and teaching environment. The voices centered in this article offer a rich source of insight into challenges faced by those who are at the forefront of the educational crisis—teachers and parents. The results showed how various communities cooperated to deal with such unprecedented times while maintaining the responsibility of educating children. The key trends that emerged from our qualitative investigation were: 1) development of collaboration among teachers as they transitioned into virtual teaching, 2) flexibility of the school leaders to assist the teachers in this new instructional modality, and 3) parents’ acknowledgment of the teachers’ efforts to assist their children. © Copyright © 2021 Bharaj and Singh.","Bharaj, P.

All the efforts taken globally to curtail the novel COVID-19; the outbreak is still on a rise owing to the community spread pattern of this infection. COVID-19 is a zoonotic infection that, like other coronavirus infections, is believed to have been originated in bats and pangolins, and later transmitted to humans. Once in the human body, this coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is abundantly present in nasopharyngeal and salivary secretions of affected patients and its spread is predominantly thought to be respiratory droplet in nature. Dental professionals may soon encounter patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and will have to act carefully not only to provide care but at the same time prevent spread of infection. Thus, the aim of this article is to provide a brief overview of the epidemiology, symptoms and routes of spread of the novel COVID-19 infection. In addition to this, specific recommendations for dental practice are prescribed for patient screening, infection control strategies, and patient management protocol.","Jadhav, Rajashree Dhananjay; Gachake, Arti Rajaram; Swami, Vasanthi V.; Jadhav, Abhishek Dhananjay",Dent Res J (Isfahan),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8174456/,754

187376,Detection of Feline leukemia virus in the endangered Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus).,2008,"OPINION STATEMENT Nausea and vomiting result from continuous interactions among gastrointestinal, central nervous system, and autonomic nervous system. Despite being closely associated, central pathways of nausea and vomiting appear to be at least partly different and nausea is no longer considered only a penultimate step of vomiting. Although our understanding of central pathways of nausea has improved over the last one decade, it is still very basic. Afferent pathways from gastrointestinal tract via vagus, vestibular system, and chemoreceptor trigger zone project to nucleus tractus solitarius which, in turn, relays the signal to central pattern generator initiating multiple downstream pathways. This central nausea pathway appears to be under constant modulation by autonomic nervous system and cerebral cortex. There is also some evidence that central pathway of chronic nausea is different from that of acute nausea and closely resembles that of neuropathic pain. This improved understanding has modified the way we can approach the treatment of acute and chronic nausea. While conventional therapies such as antiemetics (antiserotoninergic, antihistaminic, antidopaminergic) and prokinetics are commonly used to manage acute nausea, they are not as effective in improving chronic nausea. Recently, neuromodulators such as tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentin, olanzapine, benzodiazepines, and cannabinoids have been shown to have antinausea effect. There is a need to study the utility of these drugs in managing chronic functional nausea. Improving our understanding of central and peripheral circuitry of nausea will allow us to better utilize the currently available drugs and develop new therapeutic options.","Singh, Prashant; Kuo, Braden",Current treatment options in gastroenterology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27734216/,754
187590,Plaque variations in clinical isolates of bovine coronavirus.,1995,"Intracerebral inoculation of JHM virus (JHMV), the neuropathic strain of mouse hepatitis virus, into Wistar Furth, Wistar Lewis, and Fischer 344 rats at various ages indicated that Wistar Furth rats are more susceptible to the virus than are the other strains. Fischer 344 and Wistar Lewis rats were more resistant to inoculation at 2 and 5 days of age and completely resistant by 10 days of age. In contrast, Wistar Furth rats which were very susceptible at both 2 and 5 days of age remained susceptible until 21 days of age. Intracerebral challenge of an F1 cross between Wistar Furth and Wistar Lewis rats at 10 days of age indicated that resistance to JHMV infection is dominant. Cyclophosphamide treatment 28 days after intracerebral inoculation exacerbated an inapparent infection, leading to paralysis in eight of nine and death in six of nine Wistar Furth test rats. In such immunosuppressed animals, grey- and white-matter lesions were noted throughout the central nervous system, in contrast to the purely demyelinating lesions noted previously. Since rats, unlike mice, were not susceptible to disease after intracerebral injection with the serorelated viscerotropic strain MHV-3, we wished to extend our understanding of the neurological disease process elicited by the two viruses in rodents. For this reason, various mouse strains, including some with recognized immunodeficiencies, were challenged by different routes of inoculation. Intraperitoneal infection of nude and beige mice with JHMV indicated that lack of natural killer cell functions does not markedly enhance the susceptibility to virus, whereas T-cell activity appears to be essential for resisting infection. JHMV and MHV-3 replication in peritoneal macrophages from highly resistant A/J mice was reduced in comparison with that noted in macrophages from susceptible C57BL6/J mice. An initial intraperitoneal inoculation of JHMV was able to protect C57BL6/J mice against fatal intracerebral challenge within 3 days, whereas A/J mice remained susceptible beyond day 3. The protective effect did not appear to result from increased levels of circulating interferon, preceded elevation in serum JHMV-neutralizing antibody titers, and persisted for at least several weeks after intraperitoneal inoculation. Based on the combined studies described here and on previous work by us and others, it appears that the factors influencing the outcome of coronavirus disease in rodents are age at inoculation, route of challenge, genetic constitution of the virus and host, and competence of the immune system, particularly cellular immunity involving T-cells.","Sorensen, O; Dugre, R; Percy, D; Dales, S",Infection and immunity,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6290393/,754
187716,Serological prevalence of canine respiratory coronavirus in southern Italy and epidemiological relationship with canine enteric coronavirus.,2007,"Two groups of cats were experimentally infected orally with the cat-passaged RM strain of feline enteric coronavirus (FECV-RM). One group of cats (n = 19) had been chronically infected with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) for over 6 years, while a second control group (n = 20) consisted of FIV-naive siblings. Fecal virus shedding of FECV occurred in both groups starting on day 3 postinfection, nearly ceased by 4 weeks in FIV-uninfected cats, but remained at high levels in FIV-infected animals. FIV-infected cats shed virus for a longer period of time and at levels 10 to 100 times greater than those for FIV-uninfected cats. The coronavirus antibody response of the FIV-infected cats was delayed and of reduced titer compared with that of the FIV-uninfected animals. Cats in both groups remained asymptomatic for the first two months following FECV-RM infection; however, 8 to 10 weeks postinfection two cats in the FIV-infected group developed feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). The FIP viruses (designated FIPV-UCD9 and -UCD10) isolated from these two cats had almost complete genetic homology to each other and to the infecting FECV-RM. However, unlike FECV-RM, they readily induced FIP when inoculated intraperitoneally into specific-pathogen-free cats. This study confirms that FIPVs are frequently and rapidly arising mutants of FECV. Immunosuppression caused by chronic FIV infection may have enhanced the creation and selection of FIPV mutants by increasing the rate of FECV replication in the bowel and inhibiting the host's ability to combat the mutant viruses once they occurred.","Poland, A M; Vennema, H; Foley, J E; Pedersen, N C",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8940468/,754

However, little is known about the regulatory role of autophagy in influenza A virus replication. Using fluorescence and electron microscopy, we observed that autophagosomes can be induced and identified upon influenza A virus infection. The virus increased the amount of the autophagosome marker protein microtubule-associated protein light chain 3-II (LC3-II) and enhanced autophagic flux. When autophagy was pharmacologically inhibited by either 3-methylademine or wortmannin, the titers of influenza A virus were remarkably decreased. Viral reduction via autophagy inhibition was further confirmed by RNA interference, through which two different proteins required for autophagy were depleted. Noticeably, the compounds utilized had no marked effect on virus entry or cell viability, either of which might limit viral replication. Furthermore, alteration of cellular autophagy via pharmacological reagents or RNA interference impaired viral protein accumulation. Taken together, these findings indicate that autophagy is actively involved in influenza A virus replication.","Zhou, Zhi; Jiang, Xuejun; Liu, Di; Fan, Zheng; Hu, Xudong; Yan, Jinguo; Wang, Ming; Gao, George F",Autophagy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19066474/,754

188931,Antigenic variant of swine influenza virus causing proliferative and necrotizing pneumonia in pigs.,1992,"CONTEXT A critical question in pandemic influenza planning is the role nonpharmaceutical interventions might play in delaying the temporal effects of a pandemic, reducing the overall and peak attack rate, and reducing the number of cumulative deaths. Such measures could potentially provide valuable time for pandemic-strain vaccine and antiviral medication production and distribution. Optimally, appropriate implementation of nonpharmaceutical interventions would decrease the burden on health care services and critical infrastructure. OBJECTIVES To examine the implementation of nonpharmaceutical interventions for epidemic mitigation in 43 cities in the continental United States from September 8, 1918, through February 22, 1919, and to determine whether city-to-city variation in mortality was associated with the timing, duration, and combination of nonpharmaceutical interventions; altered population susceptibility associated with prior pandemic waves; age and sex distribution; and population size and density. DESIGN AND SETTING Historical archival research, and statistical and epidemiological analyses. Nonpharmaceutical interventions were grouped into 3 major categories: school closure; cancellation of public gatherings; and isolation and quarantine. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Weekly excess death rate (EDR); time from the activation of nonpharmaceutical interventions to the first peak EDR; the first peak weekly EDR; and cumulative EDR during the entire 24-week study period. RESULTS There were 115,340 excess pneumonia and influenza deaths (EDR, 500/100,000 population) in the 43 cities during the 24 weeks analyzed. Every city adopted at least 1 of the 3 major categories of nonpharmaceutical interventions. School closure and public gathering bans activated concurrently represented the most common combination implemented in 34 cities (79%); this combination had a median duration of 4 weeks (range, 1-10 weeks) and was significantly associated with reductions in weekly EDR. The cities that implemented nonpharmaceutical interventions earlier had greater delays in reaching peak mortality (Spearman r = -0.74, P < .001), lower peak mortality rates (Spearman r = 0.31, P = .02), and lower total mortality (Spearman r = 0.37, P = .008). There was a statistically significant association between increased duration of nonpharmaceutical interventions and a reduced total mortality burden (Spearman r = -0.39, P = .005). CONCLUSIONS These findings demonstrate a strong association between early, sustained, and layered application of nonpharmaceutical interventions and mitigating the consequences of the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic in the United States. In planning for future severe influenza pandemics, nonpharmaceutical interventions should be considered for inclusion as companion measures to developing effective vaccines and medications for prophylaxis and treatment.","Markel, Howard; Lipman, Harvey B; Navarro, J Alexander; Sloan, Alexandra; Michalsen, Joseph R; Stern, Alexandra Minna; Cetron, Martin S",JAMA,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17684187/,754

189833,Serologic evidence of coronavirus infection in New York and New England dairy cattle with winter dysentery.,1991,"The coronavirus main protease, M(pro), is considered to be a major target for drugs suitable for combating coronavirus infections including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). An HPLC-based screening of electrophilic compounds that was performed to identify potential M(pro) inhibitors revealed etacrynic acid tert-butylamide (6a) as an effective nonpeptidic inhibitor. Docking studies suggested a binding mode in which the phenyl ring acts as a spacer bridging the inhibitor's activated double bond and its hydrophobic tert-butyl moiety. The latter is supposed to fit into the S4 pocket of the target protease. Furthermore, these studies revealed etacrynic acid amide (6b) as a promising lead for nonpeptidic active-site-directed M(pro) inhibitors. In a fluorimetric enzyme assay using a novel fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) pair labeled substrate, compound 6b showed a K(i) value of 35.3 muM. Since the novel lead compound does not target the S1', S1, and S2 subsites of the enzyme's substrate-binding pockets, there is room for improvement that underlines the lead character of compound 6b.","Kaeppler, Ulrich; Stiefl, Nikolaus; Schiller, Markus; Vicik, Radim; Breuning, Alexander; Schmitz, Werner; Rupprecht, Daniel; Schmuck, Carsten; Baumann, Knut; Ziebuhr, John; Schirmeister, Tanja",Journal of medicinal chemistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16250642/,754

To determine the requirement of nsp4 for murine hepatitis virus (MHV) infection in culture, engineered deletions and mutations in TMs and intervening soluble regions were analyzed for effects on virus recovery, growth, RNA synthesis, protein expression, and intracellular membrane modifications. In-frame partial or complete deletions of nsp4; deletions of TM1, -2, and -3; and alanine substitutions of multiple conserved, clustered, charged residues in nsp4 resulted in viruses that were nonrecoverable, viruses highly impaired in growth and RNA synthesis, and viruses that were nearly wild type in replication. The results indicate that nsp4 is required for MHV replication and that while putative TM1, -2, and -3 and specific charged residues may be essential for productive virus infection, putative TM4 and the carboxy-terminal amino acids K(398) through T(492) of nsp4 are dispensable. Together, the experiments identify important residues and regions for studies of nsp4 topology, function, and interactions.","Sparks, Jennifer S; Lu, Xiaotao; Denison, Mark R",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17855548/,754

In group 1 (n=30), the only basic therapy was prescribed. In group 2 in addition to the basic therapy the inhalations with high concentrated oxygen with Camomile Oil were used. RESULTS Results: It is proved that the use of highly concentrated oxygen with camomile oil in the inhalation treatment regimen significantly reduces the duration of local respiratory symptoms (p<0.001) and symptoms of general intoxication (p<0.001), prolonged hospital stay decreases by an average of 5 days (p<0.001).

Although the etiology of endometriosis is unknown, several hypotheses have been proposed to explain its origin. Retrograde menstruation of endometrial cells into the peritoneum is the most widely accepted theory, however, this phenomenon occurs in approximately 90% of women while the prevalence of endometriosis is much lower. Hence, other factors are thought to contribute to the development of this disease, including exposure to environmental toxicants. Although the epidemiological evidence is equivocal, animal and experimental investigations provide a basis for the proposed association between dioxin and dioxin-like chemical exposure and endometriosis. However, the mechanism(s) underlying this potential association are poorly understood. Development of novel animal models that more reliably recapitulate the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of this disease provide exciting opportunities to further test the link between exposure to these chemicals and endometriosis. Moreover, differential expression of several novel genes that may be important in the disease provides new targets to test the actions of environmental toxicants in the pathobiology of endometriosis.","Anger, Dana L; Foster, Warren G",Frontiers in bioscience : a journal and virtual library,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17981650/,754

Knowledge of the impact of COVID-19 in patients with SAD is limited because most are included in studies carried out in patients with autoimmune and rheumatic diseases (mainly inflammatory arthritis). Most studies supported an increased risk of SARS-Cov-2 infection in patients with AD and SAD. Although case-control studies reported no significant differences in the rate of poor outcomes between patients with and without AD, large population-based studies analysing baseline risk factors reported a 2-3 times higher rate of poor outcomes in patients with AD, especially in those with SAD. Individual risk factors associated with poor outcomes included gender male, older age, and underlying comorbidities and therapies (glucocorticoids, sulfasalazine, immunosuppressants and rituximab). Patients with SAD had less favourable COVID-19 outcomes than those with inflammatory arthritis, possibly due to a differentiated underlying therapeutic approach (glucocorticoids, immunosuppressants and B-cell depleting agents for most SAD, anti-cytokine therapies and JAK inhibitors for inflammatory arthritis). Despite the limited evidence, most studies suggest that patients with SAD have an increased risk of a worse evolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including a greater risk of hospitalisation/ICU admission and worse survival rates and, therefore, should be considered a high-risk group for COVID-19.","Brito-Zerón, Pilar; Sisó-Almirall, Antoni; Flores-Chavez, Alejandra; Retamozo, Soledad; Ramos-Casals, Manuel",Clinical and experimental rheumatology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34001305/,754
193215,Respiratory disease associated with bovine coronavirus infection in cattle herds in Southern Italy.,2008,"The defense of a mucosal surface against viral infection is dependent in part on the leukocyte population resident at that site. In this study, leukocytes from the bovine intestinal epithelium were isolated and assessed for their ability to inhibit in vitro replication of an enteric pathogen, bovine coronavirus (BCV). As well, the intraepithelial leukocytes (IEL) were tested for their ability to mediate different types of cytotoxicity. The IEL were able to inhibit virus replication, and this activity was markedly enhanced by interleukin-2 and tumor necrosis factor. This combination of cytokines has similar effects on IEL-mediated cytotoxicity, which implicated cytotoxicity as a mechanism by which viral replication was limited. The IEL demonstrated enhanced cytotoxic function when compared with lymphocytes isolated from other sites in the gut-associated or systemic immune system. The IEL mediated higher levels of IL-2-activated, antibody-dependent, and lectin-dependent cytotoxicity than did lymphocytes from mesenteric lymph nodes, Peyer's patches, or the spleen. This function may be a reflection of the type of cell recruited to the epithelium, as indicated by the increased prevalence of T cells, and particularly CD8+ cells in the IEL population. Cytokine activation and the presence of a recognition signal, such as antibody, resulted in a synergistic increase in the level of IEL-mediated cytotoxicity. This type of interaction could serve to enhance the efficiency of IEL cytotoxic cells in vivo. Thus IEL-mediated cytotoxicity has the potential to serve as a mechanism of defense to enteric viral infection.","Godson, D L; Campos, M; Babiuk, L A",Viral immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1319169/,754

Understanding and defining the biology of this specific coronavirus infection may lead to targeted therapies to lessen its virulence and expand the host resistance. This study's objective was to apply morphoproteomics to pulmonary lung sections from a forensic autopsy of an untreated COVID-19 victim, so that we may better define its biology from the perspective of its interaction with the host and provide options for therapeutic targets. DESIGN Morphoproteomic analysis from a case study of this COVID-19 pulmonary infection included immunohistochemical probes to detect phosphorylated p-STAT3 (Tyr 705), as part of the interleukin (IL)-6 pathway; cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, CD8+ cytotoxic lymphocytes, Programmed Death (PD)-1 receptor+ lymphoid cells, CD56+ NK lymphoid cells, CD163+ (M2 polarized monocytes/macrophages), and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression as part of the host response to interaction with the COVID-19 virus. RESULTS Representative sections of the COVID-19 victim's lung showed: nuclear expression of p-STAT3 (Tyr 705) in many of the alveolar pneumocytes and in occasional endothelial cells; COX-2 expression in the alveolar pneumocytes; a relative paucity of CD8+ cytotoxic lymphocytes; absence of CD56+ NK lymphoid cells; abundance of intra-alveolar and alveolar interstitial CD163+ macrophages/monocytes; PD-L1 expression on occasional macrophages, focally on collections of alveolar pneumocytes, and on cells in the alveolar interstitium; and rare PD-1+ lymphocytes in similar regions as CD8+ lymphocytes. CONCLUSION Morphoproteomics and microanatomical features coincide with the etiopathogenic features of pulmonary coronavirus infection and the host response. This suggests that a targeted therapy could address the biology of COVID-19 pneumonia, enhance the host immune response and prevent its progression to a life-threatening, ventilator-dependent clinical situation.","Brown, Robert E; Wolf, Dwayne A; Hunter, Robert L; Zhao, Bihong; Buja, L Maximilian",Annals of clinical and laboratory science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32581017/,754

Antibody detection uses purified proteins of SARS-CoV-2 to determine antibody binding via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA), or colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic assay. With the advent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), nucleic acid amplification technology (NAAT) SARS-CoV-2 testing for active infection was not widely available to healthy, active-duty Soldiers. The purpose of this surveillance survey was to determine the prevalence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and symptoms of COVID-19 within a mechanized infantry brigade. MATERIALS AND METHODS Active-duty military Servicemembers (= 18 years) from a mechanized infantry brigade provided serum samples for testing for the Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 qualitative antibody test from June to September 2020 at Joint Base Lewis McChord (JBLM). In addition, participants filled out a questionnaire for symptoms and exposure to COVID-19 from January to September 2020. The surveillance team collected and analyzed antibody testing results and questionnaires from participants for antibody positivity rates and symptom prevalence. RESULTS A total of 264 participants were tested, with one (0.4%) participant testing positive for the SARS-CoV-2 antibody. On the questionnaire, 144 of 264 (54.5%) endorsed symptoms of COVID-19 from January to September 2020. The most common symptoms were headache (35%), rhinorrhea (34%), cough (35%), and sore throat (31%).

CONCLUSIONS While there are limitations inherent to SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing and the survey, prevalence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection is low. In this sample, symptoms for COVID-19 were prevalent with significant days of duty lost. Prevalence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection in this sample may be generalizable to the larger brigade. Prevalence of symptoms of possible COVID-19 are not generalizable to the larger brigade. There is utility to further studies of SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence in military populations for purposes of vaccination triaging and deployment readiness.","Koo, Alex Y; Rodgers, David K; Johnson, Keaton A; Gordon, Leanna L; Mease, Luke E; Couperus, Kyle S",Journal of special operations medicine : a peer reviewed journal for SOF medical professionals,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34529807/,754
194713,Diarrhea associated with Enterococcus faecium in an adult cat.,1999,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW In recent years, many investigators have focused on potential associations between infections and vascular inflammation. We review the principal pathogenic mechanisms that have been implicated for possible roles in the vascular inflammation initiated by infectious agents. We also summarize the most important literature related to this topic. RECENT FINDINGS A novel theory known as autoantigen complementarity suggests that an infectious agent could trigger antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis. Several recent studies investigating the presence of parvovirus B19 and herpesviruses in temporal arteries with giant cell arteritis have yielded contradictory results. A recent study has identified higher frequency of a novel human virus, the 'New Haven coronavirus', in respiratory secretions of children with Kawasaki disease. Many case reports have suggested potential relationships between human pathogens and vasculitis. SUMMARY There remains considerable interest in the possibilities of primary vasculitic syndromes caused in some fashion by infection. With the exception of a few well sustained associations - for example hepatitis B or C with known vasculitic syndromes - most of the purported links between microbial agents and primary vasculitides remain speculative.","Rodríguez-Pla, Alicia; Stone, John H",Current opinion in rheumatology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16344618/,754

However, few organizations have assessed caregivers' needs and fears related to disaster response. When nurses have been interviewed on this topic, findings indicated complex concerns involving fear of loss (e.g., loss of order in their work environment, loss of safe work conditions, loss of freedom to come and go at will, and loss of trust in their hospital's commitment to their best interest). The sobering result of anticipating these losses is fear of abandonment. The purpose of this article is to address factors identified by hospital-based nurses that contribute to their fears of abandonment in a bioterrorism emergency. Hospitals that choose to respond to these concerns will exemplify best practice toward care of the community and care of their own nurses.","Good, Linda",AAOHN journal : official journal of the American Association of Occupational Health Nurses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18183801/,754
194939,Comparison of ELISA and RT-PCR versus immune electron microscopy for detection of bovine torovirus (Breda virus) in calf fecal specimens.,2003,"INTRODUCTION Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of pneumonia in infants worldwide. We aimed to evaluate the clinical course of community-acquired RSV pneumonia in newborns hospitalized in neonatal intensive care unit. MATERIALS AND METHODS All the newborns diagnosed as pneumonia were prospectively evaluated for RSV infection between November 2010 and April 2011. Fifty-four specimens of nasopharyngeal secretions were tested in parallel with the RAT and the multiplex real time polymerase chain reaction (RT- PCR). Downes' score was used to assess the disease severity in patients with pneumonia. RESULTS RAT has a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 78.5%, as the PCR technique target assay. Four of the patients with RSV pneumonia had secundum atrial septal defect (ASD) and all of four needed mechanical ventilation support. The first day Downes' score was positively correlated with time of intravenous fluid requirement (p= 0.001, r= 0.48), total oxygen need (p= 0.000, r= 0.63), and re-enteral feeding (p= 0.001, r= 0.46). Blood pH (p= 0.031, r= 0.46) were negatively correlated with Downes' score. The second day Downes' score was higher in patients with ASD than those of without ASD (3.8 ± 2.6 vs. 2 ± 1.1, p= 0.01). The most possible risk factor for longer hospital stay was the higher second day Downes' score (p= 0.02 OR: 1.9, CI 95% (1.1-3.2). All infants were discharged from hospital in a good health. CONCLUSION RAT is sensitive and specific in detecting RSV infections in newborns. Physicians may use Downes' score for evaluation of disease severity in infants with RSV pneumonia. In these patients, ASD has increased the disease severity.","Aydın, Banu; Zenciroğlu, Ayşegül; Dilli, Dilek; Okumuş, Nurullah; İpek, M Sah; Aydın, Mustafa; Uzunalıç, Nuran; Hakan, Nilay; Kundak, Ahmet Afşin; Dursun, Arzu; Karadağ, Nilgün; Korukluoğlu, Gülay",Tuberkuloz ve toraks,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24298966/,754

196617,"Experimental infection of swine with a sandfly (Lutzomyia shannoni) isolate of vesicular stomatitis virus, New Jersey serotype.",1996,"Norwalk virus (NV), a member of the Caliciviridae family, is the major cause of acute, epidemic, viral gastroenteritis. The NV genome is a positive sense, single-stranded RNA that encodes three open reading frames (ORFs). The first ORF produces a polyprotein that is processed by the viral cysteine protease into six nonstructural proteins. We have determined the structure of the NV protease to 1.5 and 2.2 A from crystals grown in the absence or presence, respectively, of the protease inhibitor AEBSF [4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride]. The protease, which crystallizes as a stable dimer, exhibits a two-domain structure similar to those of other viral cysteine proteases with a catalytic triad composed of His 30, Glu 54, and Cys 139. The native structure of the protease reveals strong hydrogen bond interactions between His 30 and Glu 54, in the favorable syn configuration, indicating a role of Glu 54 during proteolysis. Mutation of this residue to Ala abolished the protease activity, in a fluorogenic peptide substrate assay, further substantiating the role of Glu 54 during proteolysis. These observations contrast with the suggestion, from a previous study of another norovirus protease, that this residue may not have a prominent role in proteolysis (K. Nakamura, Y. Someya, T. Kumasaka, G. Ueno, M. Yamamoto, T. Sato, N. Takeda, T. Miyamura, and N. Tanaka, J. Virol. 79:13685-13693, 2005). In the structure from crystals grown in the presence of AEBSF, Glu 54 undergoes a conformational change leading to disruption of the hydrogen bond interactions with His 30. Since AEBSF was not apparent in the electron density map, it is possible that these conformational changes are due to subtle changes in pH caused by its addition during crystallization.","Zeitler, Corinne E; Estes, Mary K; Venkataram Prasad, B V",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16641296/,754
196682,"Evaluation and application of an indirect ELISA for the detection of antibodies to bovine respiratory syncytial virus in milk, bulk milk, and serum.",1995,"OBJECTIVE To examine the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) on pulmonary function, exercise capacity, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among survivors. METHODS 110 survivors with confirmed SARS were evaluated at the Prince of Wales Hospital, HK at the end of 3 and 6 months after symptom onset. The assessment included lung volumes (TLC, VC, RV, FRC), spirometry (FVC, FEV1), carbon monoxide transfer factor (TLCO adjusted for haemoglobin), inspiratory and expiratory respiratory muscle strength (Pimax and Pemax), 6 minute walk distance (6MWD), chest radiographs, and HRQoL by SF-36 questionnaire. RESULTS There were 44 men and 66 women with a mean (SD) age of 35.6 (9.8) years and body mass index of 23.1 (4.8) kg/m2. Seventy (64%) were healthcare workers. At 6 months 33 subjects (30%) had abnormal chest radiographs; four (3.6%), eight (7.4%), and 17 (15.5%) patients had FVC, TLC, and TLCO below 80% of predicted values; and 15 (13.9%) and 24 (22.2%) had Pimax and Pemax values below 80 cm H2O, respectively. The 6MWD increased from a mean (SD) of 464 (83) m at 3 months to 502 (95) m (95% CI 22 to 54 m, p<0.001), but the results were lower than normal controls in the same age groups. There was impairment of HRQoL at 6 months. Patients who required ICU admission (n = 31) had significantly lower FVC, TLC, and TLCO than those who did not. CONCLUSION The exercise capacity and health status of SARS survivors was considerably lower than that of a normal population at 6 months. Significant impairment in surface area for gas exchange was noted in 15.5% of survivors. The functional disability appears out of proportion to the degree of lung function impairment and may be related to additional factors such as muscle deconditioning and steroid myopathy.","Hui, D S; Joynt, G M; Wong, K T; Gomersall, C D; Li, T S; Antonio, G; Ko, F W; Chan, M C; Chan, D P; Tong, M W; Rainer, T H; Ahuja, A T; Cockram, C S; Sung, J J Y",Thorax,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15860716/,754

The goals of this study were: (1) to describe the pattern of change in lower-extremity functional status of patients over a 1-year period after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and (2) to describe the effect of preoperative functional status on change over time. SUBJECTS Eighty-four patients (44 female, 40 male) with osteoarthritis, mean age of 66 years (SD=9), participated. METHODS Repeated measurements for the Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS) and the Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWT) were taken over a 1-year period. Data were plotted to examine the pattern of change over time. Different models of recovery were explored using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling that accounted for preoperative status and gender. RESULTS Growth curves were generated that depict the rate and amount of change in LEFS scores and 6MWT distances up to 1 year following TKA. The curves account for preoperative status and gender differences across participants. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION The greatest improvement occurred in the first 12 weeks after TKA. Slower improvement continued to occur from 12 weeks to 26 weeks after TKA, and little improvement occurred beyond 26 weeks after TKA. The findings can be used by physical therapists to make prognostic judgments related to the expected rate of improvement following TKA and the total amount of improvement that may be expected.","Kennedy, Deborah M; Stratford, Paul W; Riddle, Daniel L; Hanna, Steven E; Gollish, Jeffrey D",Physical therapy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17986495/,754

METHODS the SARS-CoV N gene was cloned into pQE-80L vector, and the constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21. The 6x His-tagged N protein was expressed by inducing the bacterial cells with isopropyl-1-thio-D-galactopyranoside (IPTG) and purified by Ni-NTA affinity resin. The 6x His-tagged N protein was used as antigen for ELISA assay and evaluated for the serum samples from patients with SARS positive and the plasma samples from the HIV-1 positive and negative IDUs. RESULTS all sera samples from patients with SARS positive were the ELISA positive (100% sensitivity). The ELISA assay yielded no positive results of the total 61 HIV-1 negative IDU samples (100% specificity) and two positive results of the total 68 HIV-1 positive IDU samples (97.06% specificity). CONCLUSION the specificity of the SARS-CoV N protein-based IgG ELISA assay for the detection of the SARS-CoV N specific IgG in plasma samples from IDUs with HIV-1 positive is, therefore, questionable.","Yasmon, Andi; Ibrahim, Fera; Bela, Budiman; Sjahrurachman, Agus",Acta medica Indonesiana,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22983073/,754

253354,"How did ""flatten the curve"" become ""flatten the economy?"" A perspective from the United States of America",2020,"Strong social distancing restrictions have been crucial to controlling the COVID-19 outbreak thus far, and the next question is when and how to relax these restrictions. A sequential timing of relaxing restrictions across groups is explored in order to identify policies that simultaneously reduce health risks and economic stagnation relative to current policies. The goal will be to mitigate health risks, particularly among the most fragile sub-populations, while also managing the deleterious effect of restrictions on economic activity. The results of this paper show that a properly constructed sequential release of age-defined subgroups from strict social distancing protocols can lead to lower overall fatality rates than the simultaneous release of all individuals after a lockdown. The optimal release policy, in terms of minimizing overall death rate, must be sequential in nature, and it is important to properly time each step of the staggered release. This model allows for testing of various timing choices for staggered release policies, which can provide insights that may be helpful in the design, testing, and planning of disease management policies for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and future outbreaks.","Zhao, Henry; Feng, Zhilan; Castillo-Chavez, Carlos; Levin, Simon A.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.05549v1.pdf,754

However, a subset of TLRs recognizes nucleic acids, which are present in both the host and foreign microorganisms. This specificity enables broad recognition by virtue of the ubiquity of nucleic acids but also introduces the possibility of self-recognition and autoinflammatory or autoimmune disease. Defining the regulatory mechanisms required to ensure proper discrimination between foreign and self-nucleic acids by TLRs is an area of intense research. Progress over the past decade has revealed a complex array of regulatory mechanisms that ensure maintenance of this delicate balance.
