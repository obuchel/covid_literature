However, the Covid-19 (Coronavirus) poses a major challenge to the majority of companies within these industries and may reduce their commitment to sustainable development. At the same time, a counter argument holds that a continuing commitment to sustainability will be vitally important in maintaining the relationships between the service industries and the natural and social capital on which many of them depend. This commentary paper explores sustainability within the retail and hospitality industries through the lens of the COVID-19 crisis. The paper provides an outline of the COVID-19 crisis and of its impact within the retail and hospitality industries and explores some of the relationships between COVID-19 and sustainability.","Jones, Peter; Comfort, Daphne",J Public Aff,951,18

This paper describes current practices and challenges conducting anal cancer screening for WLWH at an urban integrated safety-net system and a non-profit community-based HIV clinic. We conducted 25 semi-structured interviews with clinical and administrative stakeholders to assess knowledge, clinic practices and procedures, and experiences with anal cancer screening. Interview transcripts and fieldnotes were thematically analyzed using an iterative deductive and inductive coding scheme. Findings were organized by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) domains and constructs. Provider-level barriers to conducting anal cancer screening included limited knowledge of guidelines. System-level barriers included: structural characteristics such as lack of coordination between clinics to discern provider roles and responsibilities; and limitations in available resources such as configuration of electronic health records and infrastructure to manage referrals of abnormal anal Pap results. We conclude that anal cancer screening and follow-up for WLWH requires organization and coordination between multiple care teams, updated clinical information systems to facilitate communication and support anal Pap ordering and result documentation, and infrastructure that includes policies and protocols for management of abnormal results.

A Qualitative Study",23.342731,1.9021693,2021,"Water bloom development due to eutrophication constitutes a case of niche specialization among planktonic cyanobacteria, but the genomic repertoire allowing bloom formation in only some species has not been fully characterized. We posited that the habitat relevance of a trait begets its underlying genomic complexity, so that traits within the repertoire would be differentially more complex in species successfully thriving in that habitat than in close species that cannot. To test this for the case of bloom-forming cyanobacteria, we curated 17 potentially relevant query metabolic pathways and five core pathways selected according to existing ecophysiological literature. The available 113 genomes were split into those of blooming (45) or nonblooming (68) strains, and an index of genomic complexity for each strain's version of each pathway was derived. We show that strain versions of all query pathways were significantly more complex in bloomers, with complexity in fact correlating positively with strain blooming incidence in 14 of those pathways. Five core pathways, relevant everywhere, showed no differential complexity or correlations. Gas vesicle, toxin and fatty acid synthesis, amino acid uptake, and C, N, and S acquisition systems were most strikingly relevant in the blooming repertoire. Further, we validated our findings using metagenomic gene expression analyses of blooming and nonblooming cyanobacteria in natural settings, where pathways in the repertoire were differentially overexpressed according to their relative complexity in bloomers, but not in nonbloomers. We expect that this approach may find applications to other habitats and organismal groups.IMPORTANCE We pragmatically delineate the trait repertoire that enables organismal niche specialization. We based our approach on the tenet, derived from evolutionary and complex-system considerations, that genomic units that can significantly contribute to fitness in a certain habitat will be comparatively more complex in organisms specialized to that habitat than their genomic homologs found in organisms from other habitats. We tested this in cyanobacteria forming harmful water blooms, for which decades-long efforts in ecological physiology and genomics exist. Our results essentially confirm that genomics and ecology can be linked through comparative complexity analyses, providing a tool that should be of general applicability for any group of organisms and any habitat, and enabling the posing of grounded hypotheses regarding the ecogenomic basis for diversification.","Cao, Huansheng; Shimura, Yohei; Steffen, Morgan M; Yang, Zhou; Lu, Jingrang; Joel, Allen; Jenkins, Landon; Kawachi, Masanobu; Yin, Yanbin; Garcia-Pichel, Ferran",mBio (Online),951,30

Therefore, in order to provide new evidence-based medicine for clinical treatment, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of respiratory training in improving lung function, quality of life, and mental health of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Relevant publications were searched from clinical trials. Computer was used to retrieve Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials Repositories, PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases. The retrieval time limit was from the establishment of the database to April 2021. Two researchers independently carried out data extraction and literature quality evaluation on the quality and meta-analysis of the included literature was performed with Revman 5.3 software. RESULTS: The results of this meta-analysis will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal for publication. CONCLUSION: This study will provide reliable evidence-based evidence on the effects of breathing training on lung function, bad mood, and quality of life in patients with COVID-19. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was not required for this study. The systematic review will be published in a peer-reviewed journal, presented at conferences, and shared on social media platforms.

Nucleic-acid-based tests currently offer the most sensitive and early detection of COVID-19. However, the ""gold standard"" test pioneered by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention takes several hours to complete and requires extensive human labor, materials such as RNA extraction kits that could become in short supply, and relatively scarce qPCR machines. It is clear that a huge effort needs to be made to scale up current COVID-19 testing by orders of magnitude. There is thus a pressing need to evaluate alternative protocols, reagents, and approaches to allow nucleic-acid testing to continue in the face of these potential shortages. There has been a tremendous explosion in the number of papers written within the first weeks of the pandemic evaluating potential advances, comparable reagents, and alternatives to the ""gold-standard"" CDC RT-PCR test. Here we present a collection of these recent advances in COVID-19 nucleic acid testing, including both peer-reviewed and preprint articles. Due to the rapid developments during this crisis, we have included as many publications as possible, but many of the cited sources have not yet been peer-reviewed, so we urge researchers to further validate results in their own laboratories.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate if addition of detergent to rRT-PCR master mix (MM) enabled in-well direct lysis and detection of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical eSwab specimens. STUDY DESIGN: IGEPAL-CA-630 (IGEPAL) was added to SARS-CoV-2 MM to 0.3 % final concentration and crude sample was added directly to the PCR well containing MM. Cycle of positivity (Cp) and categorical agreement was compared in samples tested in standard rRT-PCR after NA purification and in in-well lysis, direct rRT-PCR. RESULTS: In-well lysis direct rRT-PCR detected SARS-CoV-2 in 27/30 previously SARS-CoV-2+ samples with an average bias of 3.26 cycles (95 %CI: 0.08-6.43 cycles). All 30 previously test negative samples remained negative when tested in in-well lysis, direct PCR.

This led to the suspension of service provision for elective cases. AIM: To assess the potential barriers for resuming the endoscopy service in Egypt. METHODS: A national online survey, four domains, was disseminated over a period of 4 wk in August 2020. The primary outcome of the survey was to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the endoscopy service and barriers to the full resumption of a disabled center(s). RESULTS: A hundred and thirteen Egyptian endoscopy centers participated in the survey. The waiting list was increased by &#8805; 50% in 44.9% of areas with clusters of COVID-19 cases (n = 49) and in 35.5% of areas with sporadic cases (n = 62). Thirty nine (34.8%) centers suffered from staff shortage, which was considered a barrier against service resumption by 86.4% of centers in per-protocol analysis. In multivariate analysis, the burden of cases in the unit locality, staff shortage/recovery and the availability of separate designated rooms for COVID-19 cases could markedly affect the resumption of endoscopy practice (P = 0.029, < 0.001 and 0.02, respectively) and Odd's ratio (0.15, 1.8 and 0.16, respectively). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to restrictions in endoscopic volumes. The staff shortage/recovery and the availability of COVID-19 designed rooms are the most important barriers against recovery. Increasing working hours and dividing endoscopy staff into teams may help to overcome the current situation.","Elshaarawy, Omar; Lashen, Sameh Aldesoky; Makhlouf, Nahed A; Abdeltawab, Doaa; Zaghloul, Mariam Salah; Ahmed, Rasha M; Fathy, Hayam; Afifi, Shimaa; Abdel-Gawad, Muhammad; Abdelsameea, Eman; Abd-Elsalam, Sherief; Mohamed, Salem Youssef; Tag-Adeen, Mohammed; Tharwat, Mina; Alzamzamy, Ahmed; Bekhit, Ahmed Nasr; Eid, Alshaimaa M; Awad, Abeer; Aamr, Mohammad; Dayem, Waleed A Abd El; Wifi, Mohamed-Naguib; Alboraie, Mohamed",World J Gastroenterol,951,16

We present epidemiological data for all notified cases of COVID-19 among the 17 largest immigrant groups in Norway, and related hospitalizations and mortality. Methods: We used data on all notified COVID-19 cases in Norway up to 18 October 2020, and associated hospitalizations and mortality, from the emergency preparedness register (including Norwegian Surveillance System for Communicable Diseases) set up by The Norwegian Institute of Public Health to handle the pandemic. We report numbers and rates per 100,000 people for notified COVID-19 cases, and related hospitalizations and mortality in the 17 largest immigrant groups in Norway, crude and with age adjustment. Results: The notification, hospitalization and mortality rates per 100,000 were 251, 21 and five, respectively, for non-immigrants; 567, 62 and four among immigrants; 408, 27 and two, respectively, for immigrants from Europe, North-America and Oceania; and 773, 106 and six, respectively for immigrants from Africa, Asia and South America. The notification rate was highest among immigrants from Somalia (2057), Pakistan (1868) and Iraq (1616). Differences between immigrants and non-immigrants increased when adjusting for age, especially for mortality. Immigrants had a high number of hospitalizations relative to notified cases compared to non-immigrants. Although the overall COVID-19 notification rate was higher in Oslo than outside of Oslo, the notification rate among immigrants compared to non-immigrants was not higher in Oslo than outside. Conclusions: We observed a higher COVID-19 notification rate in immigrants compared to non-immigrants and much higher hospitalization rate, with major differences between different immigrant groups. Somali-, Pakistani- and Iraqi-born immigrants had especially high rates.","Indseth, Thor; Grøsland, Mari; Arnesen, Trude; Skyrud, Katrine; Kløvstad, Hilde; Lamprini, Veneti; Telle, Kjetil; Kjøllesdal, Marte",Scand J Public Health,951,5

METHODS: Phone interviews were conducted with 103 patients with mild COVID-19 in Israel over a 6-month period (April 2020 to October 2020). Patients were recruited via social media and word to mouth and were interviewed up to 4 times, depending on reports of their unresolved symptoms. Inclusion criteria required participants to be residents of Israel aged 18 years or older, with positive COVID-19 real-time PCR results and nonsevere symptoms. The onset, duration, severity and resolution of symptoms were analysed. RESULTS: A total of 44% (45/103), 41% (42/103), 39% (40/103) and 38% (39/103) of patients experienced headache, fever, muscle ache and dry cough as the first symptom respectively. Smell and taste changes were experienced at 3.9 ± 5.4 and 4.6 ± 5.7 days (mean ± standard deviation (SD)) after disease onset respectively. Among prevalent symptoms, fever had the shortest duration (5.8 ± 8.6 days), and taste and smell changes were the longest-lasting symptoms (17.2 ± 17.6 and 18.9 ± 19.7 days; durations censored at 60 days). Longer recovery of the sense of smell correlated with the extent of smell change. At the 6-month follow-up, 46% (47/103) of the patients had at least one unresolved symptom, most commonly fatigue (22%, 23/103), smell and taste changes (15%, 15/103 and 8%, 8/103 respectively) and breathing difficulties (8%, 8/103). CONCLUSIONS: Long-lasting effects of mild COVID-19 manifested in almost half of the participants reporting at least one unresolved symptom after 6 months.","Klein, Hadar; Asseo, Kim; Karni, Noam; Benjamini, Yuval; Nir-Paz, Ran; Muszkat, Mordechai; Israel, Sarah; Niv, Masha Y",Clin. microbiol. infect,951,1

Using data from the recent wave of the EPICOVID19 study, a nationwide household-based survey including 133 cities from all states of Brazil, we estimated the proportion of people with and without antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 who were asymptomatic, which symptoms were most frequently reported, number of symptoms and the association with socio-demographic characteristics. We tested 33,205 subjects using a rapid antibody test previously validated. Information was collected before participants received the test result. Out of 849 (2.7%) participants positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, only 12.1% (95% CI 10.1-14.5) reported no symptoms, compared to 42.2% (95% CI 41.7-42.8) among those negative. The largest difference between the two groups was observed for changes in smell/taste (56.5% versus 9.1%, a 6.2-fold difference). Changes in smell/taste, fever and body aches were most likely to predict positive tests as suggested by recursive partitioning tree analysis. Among individuals without any of these three symptoms, only 0.8% tested positive, compared to 18.3% of those with both fever and changes in smell or taste. Most subjects with antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 are symptomatic, even though most present only mild symptoms.","Menezes, Ana M B; Victora, Cesar G; Hartwig, Fernando P; Silveira, Mariângela F; Horta, Bernardo L; Barros, Aluísio J D; Mesenburg, Marilia A; Wehrmeister, Fernando C; Pellanda, Lúcia C; Dellagostin, Odir A; Struchiner, Cláudio J; Burattini, Marcelo N; Barros, Fernando C; Hallal, Pedro C",Sci Rep,951,28

MATERIALS: 2,883 well-preserved skeletal elements and 9 relatively complete skulls representing an MNI of 32 non-adults (<18 years old). METHODS: All skeletal elements were observed macroscopically and pathophysiological processes underlying any lesions or other anomalies were assessed, followed by a comparative approach to rule out potential diagnoses. RESULTS: The skeletal lesions observed were caused by inflammation due to chronic hemorrhaging, marrow hyperplasia due to an increase in hemopoiesis, rapid bone growth, and the impact of biomechanical strain on poorly mineralized elements. Rickets, scurvy, and acquired anemias best fit this pattern of lesions, although inflammation from other sources such as trauma or infection could not be definitively ruled out. CONCLUSIONS: The in utero and postnatal environments at Hisban were conducive to the development of vitamin C and D deficiencies from birth until 2 years of age. The analysis of commingled remains requires an ontological shift in the importance of the individual to the population in paleopathology. SIGNIFICANCE: This investigation demonstrates the efficacy of a combined biological and comparative approach in differential diagnosis in complicated commingled collections. In addition, it emphasizes the importance of the mother-infant dyad in understanding metabolic disease. LIMITATIONS: Histological and radiographic analyses were not included in this diagnostic study due to COVID-19 travel restrictions. SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH: Isotopic analysis to investigate childhood diet and histological and radiographic analyses to assess survival of deficiencies.","Perry, Megan A; Edwards, Emily",Int J Paleopathol,951,28

We addressed the following research questions: the efficacy of LTO for more significant varus ankle arthritis, the effect of additional inframalleolar correction followed by LTO, and the preoperative or operation-related factors influencing postoperative TT decrease. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the radiographic and clinical findings of 31 patients with more significant varus ankle arthritis (&#8805;8 degrees) who underwent LTO or LTO plus inframalleolar correction. We grouped the included patients according to combination with inframalleolar correction and postoperative decreased TT. Furthermore, a binary logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the factors influencing postoperative TT decrease. RESULTS: Even though the mean TT was unchanged postoperatively (from 12.1 to 9.9 degrees, P = .052), clinical parameters were significantly increased. In the group with concomitant inframalleolar correction, we found that TT was more corrected (3.9 vs 1.8 degrees, P = .023) with a greater lateralization of the talar center and a greater correction of the hindfoot alignment to valgus. The results of the binary logistic regression analysis showed a significant relationship between postoperative decreased TT and preoperative talar center migration (P = .016), hindfoot alignment angle (P = .033), hindfoot moment arm (P = .041), and hindfoot alignment ratio (P = .016). CONCLUSION: LTO in more significant varus ankle arthritis could result in clinical improvement, although TT was not significantly changed.

There are inconsistent data on the causes of death after PCI, and the proportion of these deaths that are attributable to cardiac causes. METHODS: All patients undergoing PCI in England between January 1, 2017 and May 10, 2020 (n = 273,141) were retrospectively analyzed according to their outcome from the date of PCI: no death, in-hospital death, postdischarge death, and total 30-day death. The present study examined short-term primary causes of death after PCI in a national cohort before and during COVID-19. RESULTS: The overall rates of in-hospital and 30-day death were 1.9% and 2.8%, respectively. The rate of 30-day death declined between 2017 (2.9%) and February 2020 (2.5%), mainly due to lower in-hospital death (2.1% vs 1.5%), before rising again from March 1, 2020 (3.2%) due to higher rates of postdischarge mortality. Only 59.6% of 30-day deaths were due to cardiac causes, with the most common causes being acute coronary syndrome, cardiogenic shock, and heart failure, and this persisted throughout the study period. In the 30-day death group, 10.4% after March 1, 2020 were due to confirmed COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: In this nationwide study, we show that 40% of 30-day deaths are due to non-cardiac causes. Non-cardiac deaths have increased even more from the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, with 1 in 10 deaths from March 2020 being COVID-19 related.

To evaluate the immediate psychological impact of COVID-19, we conducted an online survey in Portugal (24-27 March 2020), using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). From the 10,529 participants (M = 31.33; SD = 9.73), 83.4% were women, had a mean age of 31.2 years, and 70.9% were active workers. Depression, anxiety, and stress were rated as moderate to severe in 11.7%, 16.9%, and 5.6% of the sample, respectively. Moreover, 49.2% of participants reported a moderate or severe psychological impact of the outbreak. Women, the unemployed, those with lower education, living in rural areas, and with flu-like symptoms or chronic disorders were risk factors. Further research is needed to identify vulnerable groups to better inform and adapt mental health policies and interventions.","Paulino, Mauro; Dumas-Diniz, Rodrigo; Brissos, Sofia; Brites, Rute; Alho, Laura; Simões, Mário R; Silva, Carlos F",Psychol Health Med,951,17

Processes such as secure login to electronic devices or identity verification at automatic border control gates are increasingly dependent on such technologies. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has increased the focus on hygienic and contactless identity verification methods. The pandemic has led to the wide use of face masks, essential to keep the pandemic under control. The effect of mask-wearing on face recognition in a collaborative environment is currently a sensitive yet understudied issue. Recent reports have tackled this by using face images with synthetic mask-like face occlusions without exclusively assessing how representative they are of real face masks. These issues are addressed by presenting a specifically collected database containing three sessions, each with three different capture instructions, to simulate real use cases. The data are augmented to include previously used synthetic mask occlusions. Further studied is the effect of masked face probes on the behaviour of four face recognition systems-three academic and one commercial. This study evaluates both masked-to-non-masked and masked-to-masked face comparisons. In addition, real masks in the database are compared with simulated masks to determine their comparative effects on face recognition performance.","Damer, Naser; Boutros, Fadi; Süßmilch, Marius; Kirchbuchner, Florian; Kuijper, Arjan",,951,18

The purpose of CPR is to maintain some blood flow until the arrival of the emergency medical services (EMS). Our concern is that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative effect on the number of patients who get CPR before EMS arrival. The aim of this study is to compare the incidence of bystander CPR during the pandemic with data from before the pandemic. METHODS: The protocol is for a retrospective cohort study where data from existing registries will be used. All participating registries will share aggregated data from 2017 to 2020, and the study team will compare the results from 2020 to results from 2017 to 2019. Due to the General Data Protection Regulation, each participating registry will check for completeness and plausibility, and perform all aggregation of data locally. In the following analysis different registries will be considered as random samples and analysed by means of a generalized linear mixed effects model with Poisson distribution for the outcome, the population covered as offsets, and different registries as random factors. DISCUSSION: This study does not present the prospect of direct benefit to the patient, but does provide an opportunity to gain a better understanding of the epidemiology of bystander CPR for OHCA patients during a pandemic. By comparing data during the pandemic with already collected information in established registries we believe we can gain valuable information about changes in public response to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.","Tjelmeland, Ingvild B M; Wnent, Jan; Masterson, Siobhan; Kramer-Johansen, Jo; Gräsner, Jan-Thorsten",Scand J Trauma Resusc Emerg Med,951,16

METHODS: We conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study on 27 migraine patients, using a well-established trigeminal nociceptive paradigm, examining patients before and two weeks after administration of the CGRP-receptor-antibody erenumab 70 mg. RESULTS: Comparing both visit days in all patients (n=27) revealed that erenumab leads to a decrease in activation in the right thalamus (i.e. contralateral to the stimulated side), right middle temporal gyrus, right lingual gyrus, left operculum, and several clusters on both sides of the cerebellum. Furthermore, when contrasting responders (n=9) and non-responders (n=8) of the respective same headache state, we found a significant reduction of hypothalamic activation after the administration of erenumab in responders only (T-value: 4.78; contrast estimate [90% CI]: 29.79 [19.53; 40.05]). This finding of reduced hypothalamic activation was confirmed when using the absolute headache days as a regressor. INTERPRETATION: These findings suggest that erenumab may not be an exclusively peripheral migraine treatment but has additional central effects. Whether this is due to secondary changes following peripheral modulation of sensory input or indeed represents a direct central mode of action is discussed.","Ziegeler, Christian; Mehnert, Jan; Asmussen, Katharina; May, Arne",Neurology,951,18

Here we investigated the therapeutic potential of co-inhibiting integrin-dependent signaling pathway and BRD4, a transcriptional and epigenetic mediator, for TNBC. METHODS: Two independent patient cohorts were subjected to bioinformatic and IHC examination for clinical association of candidate cancer drivers. The efficacy and biological bases for co-targeting these drivers were interrogated using cancer cell lines, a protein kinase array, chemical inhibitors, RNAi/CRISPR/Cas9 approaches, and a 4 T1-Balb/c xenograft model. RESULTS: We found that amplification of the chromosome 8q24 region occurred in nearly 20% of TNBC tumors, and that it coincided with co-upregulation or amplification of c-Myc and FAK, a key effector of integrin-dependent signaling. This co-upregulation at the mRNA or protein level correlated with a poor patient survival (p < 0.0109 or p < 0.0402, respectively). Furthermore, we found that 14 TNBC cell lines exhibited high vulnerabilities to the combination of JQ1 and VS-6063, potent pharmacological antagonists of the BRD4/c-Myc and integrin/FAK-dependent pathways, respectively. We also observed a cooperative inhibitory effect of JQ1 and VS-6063 on tumor growth and infiltration of Ly6G+ myeloid-derived suppressor cells in vivo. Finally, we found that JQ1 and VS-6063 cooperatively induced apoptotic cell death by altering XIAP, Bcl2/Bcl-xl and Bim levels, impairing c-Src/p130Cas-, PI3K/Akt- and RelA-associated signaling, and were linked to EMT-inducing transcription factor Snail- and Slug-dependent regulation. CONCLUSION: Based on our results, we conclude that the BRD4/c-Myc- and integrin/FAK-dependent pathways act in concert to promote breast cancer cell survival and poor clinical outcomes. As such, they represent promising targets for a synthetic lethal-type of therapy against TNBC.","Zhang, Yang; Xu, Bingwei; Shi, Junfeng; Li, Jieming; Lu, Xinlan; Xu, Li; Yang, Helen; Hamad, Nevean; Wang, Chi; Napier, Dana; He, Shuixiang; Liu, Chunming; Liu, Zeyi; Qian, Hai; Chen, Li; Wei, Xiaowei; Zheng, Xucai; Huang, Jian-An; Thibault, Olivier; Craven, Rolf; Wei, Dongping; Pan, Yueyin; Zhou, Binhua P; Wu, Yadi; Yang, Xiuwei H",Cellular oncology (2011.

These features amplify its psychological toxicity, and increase the number of psychological casualties it inflicts. Uncertainty was fueled by lack of knowledge about the lethality of a disaster, its duration, and ambiguity in messaging from leaders and healthcare authorities. Human resilience can have a buffering effect on the psychological impact. Experts have advocated ""flattening the curve"" to slow the spread of the infection. Our strategy for crisis leadership is focused on flattening the rise in psychological casualties by increasing resilience among healthcare workers. This paper describes an approach employed at Johns Hopkins to promote and enhance crisis leadership. The approach is based on four factors: vision for the future, decisiveness, effective communication, and following a moral compass. We recommend specific actionable recommendations for implementing these factors that are being disseminated to frontline leaders and managers. The COVID-19 pandemic is destined to have a strong psychological impact that extends far beyond the end of quarantine. Following these guidelines has the potential to build resilience and thus reduce the number of psychological casualties and speed the return to normal - or at least the new normal in the post-COVID world.","Everly, George S; Wu, Albert W; Crumpsty-Fowler, Carolyn J; Dang, Deborah; Potash, James B",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,951,18
