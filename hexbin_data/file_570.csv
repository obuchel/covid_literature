8723,Procedimientos de identificación viral en infección respiratoria,2015-06-23,"It is well known that DNA-based organisms rearrange and repair their genomic DNA through recombination processes, and that these rearrangements serve as a powerful source of variability and adaptation for these organisms. In RNA viruses' genetic recombination is defined as any process leading to the exchange of information between viral RNAs. There are two types of recombination events: legitimate and illegitimate. While legitimate (homologous) recombination occurs between closely related sequences at corresponding positions, illegitimate (nonhomologous) recombination could happen at any position among the unrelated RNA molecules. In order to differentiate between the symmetrical and asymmetrical homologous crosses, Lai defined the former as homologous recombination and the latter as aberrant homologous recombination. This chapter uses brome mosaic virus (BMV), a multicomponent plant RNA virus, as an example to discuss the progress in studying the mechanism of genetic recombination in positive-stranded RNA viruses. Studies described in this chapter summarize the molecular approaches used to increase the frequency of recombination among BMV RNA segments and, more importantly, to target the sites of crossovers to specific BMV RNA regions. It demonstrates that the latter can be accomplished by introducing local complementarities to the recombining substrates.","Bujarski, Jozef J.; Nagy, Peter D.; Flasinski, Stanislaw",Adv Virus Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131656/,570
9046,Pathologies respiratoires infectieuses : des concepts à la pratique !,2017-07-10,"Pathogenicity is a complex process with stringent requirements of both the host cell and the infecting virion. Among these requirements are a port of entry into host cells, a means of replication for the virus, and a means by which infection damages host cells. Damage to the host can result from multiple mechanisms including transformation, suppression of cellular metabolism, apoptosis, autoimmune responses directed against infected or uninfected tissues, or by molecular mimicry. In the attempt to identify new associations between viral infection and disease, investigators should be mindful that variable host factors as well as viral infection may be required for pathogenesis. Efforts to associate specific viral infections with specific diseases may be obscured by final common pathways through which multiple agents damage host cells in similar ways.","Hibbs, Jonathan; Young, Neal S.",Baillieres Clin Haematol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134682/,570

Interventionists, often TWOC themselves, who provided these services developed caring relationships, promoted personal empowerment, and became role models for participants and the community. Intervention groups engaged participants to reinforce the importance of health and HIV care and provided mutual support. Gender affirming services and caring relationships may be two key characteristics of interventions that address individual and structural-level barriers to engage TWOC in HIV care.","Maiorana, Andres; Sevelius, Jae; Keatley, JoAnne; Rebchook, Greg",AIDS Behav,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223907/,570
14718,Recomendaciones preventivas cardiovasculares. Actualización PAPPS 2020(),2020-12-30,"PURPOSE: U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended telavancin dosing is based on total body weight (TBW) but lacks adjusted regimens for obese subjects with varying renal function. Our aim was to develop a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model of telavancin to design optimized dosing regimens for obese patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and varying renal function. METHODS: The PBPK model was verified using clinical pharmacokinetic (PK) data of telavancin in healthy populations with varying renal function and obese populations with normal renal function. Then, the PBPK model was applied to predict the PK in obese HAP patients with renal impairment (RI). RESULTS: The fold error values of PK parameters (AUC, C(max), T(max)) were all within 1.5. The telavancin AUC(0-inf) was predicted to increase 1.07-fold in mild RI, 1.23-fold in moderate RI, 1.41-fold in severe RI, and 1.57-fold in end-stage renal disease (ESRD), compared with that in obese HAP with normal renal function. The PBPK model combined with Monte Carlo simulations (MCS) suggested that dose adjustment based on a 750-mg-fixed dose could achieve effectiveness with reduced risk of toxicity, compared with current TBW-based dosing recommendations. CONCLUSION: The PBPK simulation proposed that using TBW-based regimen in obesity with RI should be avoided. Dose recommendations in obesity from the PBPK model are 750 mg daily for normal renal function and mild RI, 610 mg daily for moderate RI, 530 mg daily for severe RI, and 480 mg daily for ESRD.

18879,‘Too many mice make no lining for their nest’ – Reasons and effects of parallel governmental structures for disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation in Southern Africa,2021-06-17,"There are calls for better empirical models to inform climate change adaptation in smallholder agriculture. Hitherto adaptation studies have failed to comprehensively integrate non-cognitive behavioural factors (e.g. psychological capital), and there is also no common framework for measuring non-cognitive abilities of smallholder farmers. Hence, this study is the first attempt to assess how psychological capital affects climate change adaptation amongst smallholder farmers. The study estimated the multivariate probit regression model using data collected from 328 smallholder farmers in KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa. The results show an association between some psychological capital indicators and smallholder adaptation decisions. Social networks, having multiple farming objectives, access to credit and the type of farmer (irrigators vs. non-irrigators) were also significant in determining smallholders’ adaptation decisions. In conclusion, the study recommends the need for practical ways for enhancing smallholders’ endowment with key non-cognitive abilities. There is also a need for researchers to develop a comprehensive framework for assessing non-cognitive factors critical for climate change adaptation. This will improve the use of positive psychology theories to advance the literature on climate change adaptation. Support should also be provided to communities facing higher risks of climate change adaptation. More focus should also be given to improve smallholder farmers’ ability to adapt, including access to affordable credit. The role of social networks in information sharing remains critical, and hence their promotion should be prioritised. The findings on multiple objectives in farming were unique to climate change adaptation research, and hence the indicator should be considered in future similar studies.","Chipfupa, Unity; Tagwi, Aluwani; Wale, Edilegnaw",Jamba,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8252145/,570

It grows within a wide temperature range (15–33°C), survives between 7 and 10°C for several months without alterations in its further virus susceptibility and growth characteristics, and degenerates at 37°C. Its karyotype is 2n=96. It propagates most of the systemic infection viruses of the fish families Salmonidae, Cyprinidae, Anguillidae and Esocidae, as well as Indiana-type vesicular stomatitis virus. Despite the origin of EPC cells, we were unable to demonstrate the presence of herpes virus in them. Their transformation was reflected in their karyotype (normally 2n=100) and by their growth ability in soft agar medium; monolayer growth, however, was inhibited at a density of 3×10(6) cells/cm(2). The temperature growth range, good splitting ratio (1/10) and virus susceptibility make EPC cells a highly suitable material both for fish pathology and for comparative virology studies.","Fijan, N.; Sulimanović, D.; Bearzotti, M.; Muzinić, D.; Zwillenberg, L.O.; Chilmonczyk, S.; Vautherot, J.F.; de Kinkelin, P.",Ann Inst Pasteur Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7135074/,570

28540,Breves en enfermería,2014-02-19,"This chapter presents a new model of thinking for evaluating social development work. The social assessment framework put forward is based on TNS stakeholder management model, TRI*M, and focuses on the critical area of how aid and donor organizations can assess the effectiveness of social development programs. The Millennium Development Goals have opened up a two way street between donors and beneficiaries and has provided for a need to look at social development assessment from a new perspective. The reader is taken through a journey of how the model came about, challenges faced during the process, and a vision for how the model will be used in the future. The two basic components of the model, the Program Effectiveness Index and the TRI*M Grid for understanding program drivers, are explained. A case study covering the Tsunami relief effort in Aceh, where the model was used for the first time, is included as an example of how TNS was able to deliver insight and clear direction in an otherwise complex environment. A client perspective is also provided both in terms of needs assessment and actions taken by UNICEF as a result. The chapter concludes with a reflection of what the future holds and the opportunity to apply the framework in other countries as well as for different situations.","Lindgren, Daniel; Budd, John",Public Opinion Polling in a Globalized World,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7139441/,570

It is therefore perceivable that the endothelium of the lung contributes significantly to the circulation of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which include exosomes, microvesicles, and apoptotic bodies. In addition to the endothelium, EVs may arise from alveolar macrophages, fibroblasts and epithelial cells. Because EVs harbor cargo molecules, such as miRNA, mRNA, and proteins, these intercellular communicators provide important insight into the health and disease condition of donor cells and may serve as useful biomarkers of lung disease processes. This comprehensive review focuses on what is currently known about the role of EVs as markers and mediators of lung pathologies including COPD, pulmonary hypertension, asthma, lung cancer and ALI/ARDS. We also explore the role EVs can potentially serve as therapeutics for these lung diseases when released from healthy progenitor cells, such as mesenchymal stem cells.","Mohan, Aradhana; Agarwal, Stuti; Clauss, Matthias; Britt, Nicholas S.; Dhillon, Navneet K.",Respir Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7341477/,570

Responding to the commission on religious education’s recommendation for primary initial teacher education,2020-09-19,"As I already mentioned, ozone (from the Greek means to give off a smell) is a natural but unstable molecule. The pure gas has a soft sky-blue colour with a pungent, acrid smell. The molecule is composed of three oxygen atoms (O(3)) and, the molecular weight, in comparison to the oxygen diatomic molecule (32.00) is of 48.00. Ozone has a cyclical structure with a distance among oxygen atoms of 1.26 Å and exists in several mesomeric states in dynamic equilibrium. For the physician it is useful to know that the solubility (ml) in 100 ml water (at 0°C) of either ozone or oxygen is either 49.0 ml or 4.89 (ten fold lower), respectively. Consequently the great solubility of ozone in water allows its immediate reaction with any soluble compounds and biomolecules present in biological fluids. Either traces of oxygen polymers (O(4)) or ozone polymers (O(6) and O(9)) can be generated but the idea that superactive ozone polymers/clusters may have a therapeutic role remains speculative (Cacace et al., 2001; Murai et al., 2003).","Bocci, Velio",OZONE,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7498869/,570

We propose simple model that describes air flow around ship hull with constant initial speed and direction which is based on the law of reflection. On the boundary the model reduces to the known model for potential flow around a cylinder, and near the boundary they are not equivalent, but close enough to visualise the effect of the hull on the flow. Then we apply this model to simulate air flow around real-world ship hull and conclude that for any real-world situation ship roll angle and ship speed caused by the wind is small to not cause capsizing, but large enough to be considered in onboard intelligent systems that determine real roll, pitch and yaw angles during ship operation and similar applications.","Gavrikov, Anton; Degtyarev, Alexander; Egorov, Denis; Gankevich, Ivan; Grigorev, Artemii; Khramushin, Vasily; Petriakov, Ivan",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7975005/,570

Due to the rapid growth of these techniques, researchers have been increasingly interested in the availability of strategies, models or data that may assist process optimization. In fact, 3D parts often exhibit limited mechanical performance, which is usually the result of poor bonding between adjacent filaments. In turn, the latter is influenced by the temperature field history during deposition. This study aims at evaluating the influence of considering a phase change from the melt to the solid state on the heat transfer during the deposition stage, as undergone by semi-crystalline polymers. The energy equation considering solidification is solved analytically and then inserted in the MatLab® code previously developed by the authors to model cooling in FFF. The predictions of temperature evolution during the deposition of a simple 3D part demonstrate the importance of that thermal condition and highlight the influence of the type of material used for FFF.","Costa, S.

This study investigated whether nutritional risk screening score is an independent predictor of NV-HAP. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted between September 2017 and June 2020 in a tertiary hospital in China. The tool of Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 (NRS-2002) was used for nutritional risk screening. A total score of ≥3 indicated a patient was “at nutritional risk.” Logistic regression was applied to explore the association between the NRS score and NV-HAP. RESULTS: A total of 67,280 unique patients were included in the study. The incidence of NV-HAP in the cohort for the NRS < 3 and ≥ 3 NRS group was 0.4% (232/62702) and 2.6% (121/4578), respectively. In a multivariable logistic regression model adjusted for all of the covariates, per 1-point increase in the NRS score was associated with a 30% higher risk of NV-HAP (OR = 1.30; 95%CI:1.19–1.43). Similarly, patients with NRS score ≥ 3 had a higher risk of NV-HAP with an odds ratio (OR) of 2.06 (confidence interval (CI): 1.58–2.70) than those with NRS score < 3. Subgroup analyses indicated that the association between the NRS score and the risk of NV-HAP was similar for most strata. Furthermore, the interaction analyses revealed no interactive role in the association between NRS score and NV-HAP. CONCLUSION: NRS score is an independent predictor of NV-HAP, irrespective of the patient’s characteristics. NRS-2002 has the potential as a convenient tool for risk stratification of adult hospitalized patients with different NV-HAP risks.

Itaconate, an important intermediate metabolite isolated from the tricarboxylic acid cycle, is derived from cis-aconitate decarboxylation mediated by immune response gene 1 in mitochondrial matrix. Itaconate has emerged as a key autocrine regulatory component involved in the development and progression of inflammation and immunity. It could directly modify cysteine sites on functional substrate proteins which related to inflammasome, signal transduction, transcription, and cell death. Itaconate can be a connector among immunity, metabolism, and inflammation, which is of great significance for further understanding the mechanism of cellular immune metabolism. And it could be the potential choice for the treatment of inflammation and immune-related diseases. This study is a systematic review of the potential mechanisms of metabolite associated with different pathology conditions. We briefly summarize the structural characteristics and classical pathways of itaconate and its derivatives, with special emphasis on its promising role in future clinical application, in order to provide theoretical basis for future research and treatment intervention.","Lin, Jiaqi; Ren, Jinxuan; Gao, Dave Schwinn; Dai, Yi; Yu, Lina",Front Chem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8149739/,570

METHODS: The clinical data of 420 patients with hydatid disease who were treated in our hospital from October 2015 to October 2018 were collected from the database of our hospital. According to the postoperative pathological diagnosis, 200 patients were assigned into the alveolar echinococcosis (AE) group, and 220 patients were assigned into the cystic echinococcosis (CE) group. A total of 160 healthy examinees were enrolled as the control group. The main observation indexes included preoperative PLR and NLR. Pearson’s correlation was used to analyze the correlation between PLR and NLR with clinical indicators in HE patients, and the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the clinical values of PLR and NLR in diagnosing different types of hydatid diseases. RESULTS: The results revealed that the expressions of PLR and NLR were significantly higher in the AE group than in the CE and control groups (P<0.05). The results of multiple linear regression analysis revealed that PLR was positively correlated with aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase and γ-glutamyltranspeptidase (P<0.05). NLR was correlated with albumin content (P<0.05). ROC curve analysis results revealed that the area under the curve (AUC) of PLR and NLR for AE was 0.800 and 0.700 respectively, and the AUC for CE was 0.78 and 0.75 respectively. CONCLUSION: The NLR and PLR of AE patients were higher than those of CE patients, and the high inflammation of CE patients may be correlated to the reproductive mode of Echinococcus multilocularis. PLR and NLR have certain diagnostic values for disease classification, but PLR has higher specificity when compared with NLR.","E, Weijian; Wang, Zhixin; Pang, Mingquan; Lu, Yongliang; Fan, Haining",J Inflamm Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8184230/,570

We discover that deposit interest rates at bank branches in counties with higher COVID-19 infection rates fell by more than rates at branches—even branches of the same bank—in counties with lower infection rates. Credit drawdowns, national policies, such as the Payment Protection Program, and a flight-to-safety do not account for these cross-branch changes in deposit rates. Evidence suggests that higher local COVID-19 infection rates are associated with households’ greater anxiety about future job and income losses, anxiety that induces households to reduce spending and increase deposits.","Levine, Ross; Lin, Chen; Tai, Mingzhu; Xie, Wensi",Rev Financ Stud,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8241436/,570

Therefore, developing broad-spectrum antiviral treatments is particularly important. Host responses to IAV infection provide a promising approach to identify antiviral factors involved in virus infection as potential molecular drug targets. In this study, in order to better illustrate the molecular mechanism of host responses to IAV and develop broad-spectrum antiviral drugs, we systematically analyzed mRNA expression profiles of host genes in a variety of human cells, including transformed and primary epithelial cells infected with different subtypes of IAV by mining 35 microarray datasets from the GEO database. The transcriptomic results showed that IAV infection resulted in the difference in expression of amounts of host genes in all cell types, especially those genes participating in immune defense and antiviral response. In addition, following the criteria of P<0.05 and |logFC|≥1.5, we found that some difference expression genes were overlapped in different cell types under IAV infection via integrative gene network analysis. IFI6, IFIT2, ISG15, HERC5, RSAD2, GBP1, IFIT3, IFITM1, LAMP3, USP18, and CXCL10 might act as key antiviral factors in alveolar basal epithelial cells against IAV infection, while BATF2, CXCL10, IFI44L, IL6, and OAS2 played important roles in airway epithelial cells in response to different subtypes of IAV infection. Additionally, we also revealed that some overlaps (BATF2, IFI44L, IFI44, HERC5, CXCL10, OAS2, IFIT3, USP18, OAS1, IFIT2) were commonly upregulated in human primary epithelial cells infected with high or low pathogenicity IAV. Moreover, there were similar defense responses activated by IAV infection, including the interferon-regulated signaling pathway in different phagocyte types, although the differentially expressed genes in different phagocyte types showed a great difference. Taken together, our findings will help better understand the fundamental patterns of molecular responses induced by highly or lowly pathogenic IAV, and the overlapped genes upregulated by IAV in different cell types may act as early detection markers or broad-spectrum antiviral targets.","Zhou, Ao; Dong, Xia; Liu, Mengyun; Tang, Bin",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8337049/,570

The potential gains associated with cross-border macroprudential coordination, dwelling on both recent analytical contributions and quantitative studies based on multi-country models with financial frictions, are then evaluated. The issue of whether coordination of macroprudential policies simultaneously requires some degree of monetary policy coordination is also discussed. The analysis focuses on the potential for policy coordination between major advanced economies and a group identified as systemically-important middle-income countries (SMICs). Next, practical ways to promote international macroprudential policy coordination are considered. Following a discussion of Basel III’s Principle of reciprocity and ways to improve it, the paper advocates a further strengthening of the current statistical, empirical and analytical work conducted by international financial institutions to evaluate, and raise awareness of, the gains from international coordination of macroprudential policies.","Agénor, Pierre-Richard; Pereira da Silva, Luiz A.",Int Econ Econ Policy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8514282/,570

PATIENTS AND METHODS This retrospective study was designed and implemented from 100 cone-beam computed tomographic scans (CBCTs) of patients with age ranging from 18 to 65 years old. The primary outcome was to assess the incidence of mandibular third molars (Md3s) with existing lingual cortex perforation by their roots. Perforation was assessed at the level of root apex and the most lingual portion on the apical half of the root. Other outcome variables included average thickness of covering lingual bone in the nonperforation group, lingual cortex morphology, impaction, and demographics. Descriptive statistics were computed. RESULTS More than half the radiographs showed lingual cortex perforation at the level of root apex and most lingual portion on the apical one half of the root (51.2% and 52.8%, respectively). The average thickness of the covering lingual bone was 1.25 mm around the root apex and 0.93 mm around the most lingual portion on the apical half of the root. The most common lingual cortex morphology was the undercut shape. There was statistically significant association between the presence of Md3 impaction and perforation at both root levels (P value < .001, Effect size = 0.378) and (P value < .001, Effect size = 0.445). CONCLUSIONS Perforation of the lingual cortex by Md3s, whether erupted or impacted, was found in >50% of patients as determined by a preoperative CBCT scan. Therefore, the finding of lingual cortex perforation after removal of Md3s is likely to be evidence of a pre-existing condition rather than a result of surgery.","Amin, Sara A; Elsheikh, Ahmad K; Bagheri, Shahrokh C; Meyer, Roger A",Journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery : official journal of the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joms.2020.08.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32916133/,570

We have developed and present here an initial feasibility and safety study of transanal total mesorectal excision (TME) with splenic flexure release, high ligation of the IMA and IMV, and side-to-end coloanal anastomosis with temporary diverting ileostomy for rectal cancer. METHODS A program of full NOTES TME resection with release of the splenic flexure, high ligation of the IMA/IMV, with side-to-end coloanal anastomosis was performed transanally from December 2013 to July 2014. Demographics, preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative data were prospectively obtained. Operative components were broken into TME, colonic mobilization, splenic flexure release, IMA/IMV transection, transanal extraction of specimen, and coloanal anastomosis for analysis of performance completion. RESULTS There were 3 women and 1 man on whom we operated. Mean age was 56 (46-65). Mean BMI was 26 (23.8-30.2). The operation was completed entirely transanally in 2 patients. Transanal component completion of the operation was as follows: TME in 3/4; colonic mobilization in 4/4; splenic flexure release in 3/4; IMA/IMV transection in 3/4; transanal specimen extraction in 4/4; coloanal anastomosis in 4/4. Abdominal time for completion of component parts was: splenic flexure release 4:53 (min:s), IMA/IMV 19:43, completion of TME 13:41. Mean EBL was 194 cc (25-500). Aside from stoma site, there were no abdominal incisions. There were no mortalities. Mesorectum was intact in all 4 patients and with negative circumferential and distal margins. CONCLUSION This experience supports the feasibility and safety of a true NOTES TME. The critical anatomic views demonstrated on video affirm the potential of this approach for distal rectal cancer. Colorectal surgery represents the most logical application for NOTES. While highly promising, a great deal of work remains to develop the technique and applicability of NOTES colorectal surgery.","Marks, John H; Lopez-Acevedo, Nicolas; Krishnan, Barath; Johnson, Matthew N; Montenegro, Grace A; Marks, Gerald J",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-015-4731-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26823054/,570

Most surgeons would favor a standard anterior hernioplasty to minimize the potential risk of damaging the spermatic cord structures that are always intimately fused to the congenital peritoneal sac. This also means overlooking the potential benefit of alternative posterior techniques such as endoscopic totally extraperitoneal (TEP) repair that is known to offer faster recovery with reduced risk of developing chronic groin pain. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety of TEP approach for repair of adult inguinoscrotal hernias associated with completely PPV and to compare those results with a corresponding group of male patients undergoing an identical procedure, but with no demonstrated PPV. METHODS This is a prospective study of consecutive male patients diagnosed with inguinal hernia during a 10-year period and eligible for endoscopic TEP repair. Every recognized completely PPV were systematically divided taking care not to damage the attached cord structures and the proximal end closed with a pre-tied Endoloop of PDS. In both groups, all meshes were secured with fibrin sealant only. Patients were reviewed in clinic 2 and 6 weeks after the operation. Further follow-up was scheduled if deemed necessary. The primary post-operative outcome parameter was spermatic cord injury; secondary outcome parameters included groin pain, surgical complications, and recurrence. RESULTS Nine hundred and thirty-nine hernia repairs were prospectively recorded during this period. All procedures were carried out endoscopically. A total of 41 patients with a median age of 27 years presented with 43 inguinoscrotal hernias (two bilateral) related to the presence of a congenital completely PPV. 72% of them were right-sided. No injury to the cord structures was recorded and only one complication (2.4%) occurred at 1 week post-operatively that was unrelated to the PPV. There was no report of chronic groin or testicular pain, symptomatic seroma formation, or hernia recurrence. By comparison, out of the 608 patients representing the no PPV group, there were 35 complications out of 33 patients (5.4%), one of those requiring subsequent laparoscopic revision. Only one early post-operative recurrence was recorded in this group (0.15%). CONCLUSIONS In the presence of a completely PPV, the recognized benefit of a posterior approach, such as endoscopic TEP inguinal hernia repair, outweighs the theoretical risk of damaging the spermatic cord structures when dissecting and dividing the congenital hernia sac. This technique should be the preferred option among expert laparoscopic surgeons.","Berney, C R",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-017-1632-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28698899/,570

We aimed to assess whether a systematic approach to disconnect tracheotomized neurological and neurosurgical patients off the ventilator (intervention) is superior to the sole physician's judgment (control). Based on previous work in intubated patients, we hypothesized a reduction of the rate of failure within 48 h from 15 to 5 %. Secondary endpoints were duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay and mortality. METHODS We designed a single center randomized controlled study. Since no data are available on tracheotomized patients, we based our a priori power analysis on results derived from intubated patients and calculated an overall sample size of 280 patients. RESULTS After inclusion of 168 consecutive patients, the trial was interrupted because the attending physicians judged the observed rate of reconnection to be much greater than expected. The overall rate of failure was 29 %, confirming the physicians' judgment. Twenty-one patients (24 %) in the intervention group and 27 (33 %) controls were reconnected to the ventilator within 48 h (p = 0.222). The main reasons for failure were respiratory distress (80 and 88 % in the treatment and control group, respectively), hemodynamic impairment (15 and 4 % in the treatment and control group, respectively), neurological deterioration (4 % in the control group only). The duration of mechanical ventilation was of 412 ± 202 h and 402 ± 189 h, in the control and intervention group, respectively. ICU length of stay was on average of 23 days for both groups. ICU mortality was 6 % in the control and 2 % in the intervention group without significant differences.

The diagnosis was based on the clinical picture of community-acquired pneumonia, data of chest multispiral computed tomography, and a positive test for COVID-19. ECG was recorded both in 3-6 and in 12 leads. Signs of right ventricular (RV) stress, so-called systolic overload (high R and inverted TV1-3 and TII, III, aVF), and diastolic overload (RV wall hypertrophy and cavity dilatation; complete or incomplete right bundle branch block) were evaluated.Results The most common signs for impaired functioning of the right heart include emergence of the RV P wave phase (41.3 %), incomplete right bundle branch block (42.6 %), ECG of the SIQ IIITIII type (33.3 %) typical for thromboembolic complications, and signs of RV hypertrophy, primarily increased SV5-6 (14.7 %). These changes are either associated with signs of RV myocardial stress (16 %) or appear on the background of signs for diffuse hypoxia evident as tall, positive, sharp-ended T waves in most leads (28 %).Conclusion A conclusive, comprehensive assessment of the reversal of hemodynamic disorders and electrocardiographic dynamics in patients with COVID-19 will be possible later, when more data become available.","Ryabykina, G V",Kardiologiia,https://doi.org/10.18087/cardio.2020.8.n1192; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33155954/,570

Addressing such a gap is timely as HWs are pivotal resources, particularly during pandemics or the ensuing recessions. Drawing from the empirical literature, we aimed to provide a framework for understanding the impact of recessions on HWs and their reactions. We use a systematic review and best-fit framework synthesis approach to identify the relevant qualitative, quantitative and mixed-methods evidence, and refine an a priori, theory-based conceptual framework. Eight relevant databases were searched, and four reviewers employed to independently review full texts, extract data and appraise the quality of the evidence retrieved. A total of 57 peer-reviewed publications were included, referring to six economic recessions. The 2010-15 Great Recession in Europe was the subject of most (52%) of the papers. Our consolidated framework suggests that recessions transmit to HWs through three channels: (1) an increase in the demand for services; (2) the impacts of austerity measures; and (3) changes in the health labour market. Some of the evidence appeared specific to the context of crises; demand for health services and employment increased during economic recessions in North America and Oceania, but stagnated or declined in Europe in connection with the austerity measures adopted. Burn-out, lay-offs, migration and multiple jobholding were the reactions observed in Europe, but job opportunities never dwindled for physicians during recessions in North America, with nurses re-entering labour markets during such crises. Loss of motivation, absenteeism and abuse of health systems were documented during recessions in low-income countries. Although the impacts of recessions may vary across economic events, health systems, labour markets and policy responses, our review and framework provide an evidence base for policies to mitigate the effects on HWs.","Russo, Giuliano; Silva, Tiago Jesus; Gassasse, Zakariah; Filippon, Jonathan; Rotulo, Arianna; Kondilis, Elias",Health policy and planning,https://doi.org/10.1093/heapol/czaa180; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33393588/,570

Most patients are diagnosed at the advanced stage, primarily because there are not yet any valid biomarkers available for early diagnosis. Useful biomarkers are absolutely necessary for early detection of PBC. Fortunately, the use of MALDI-TOF-MS and pattern recognition software has been successful in finding specific markers for the early detection of the disease. To screen for potential protein biomarkers in the serum for diagnosing PBC, MALDI-TOF-MS combined with magnetic beads and pattern recognition software was used to investigate 119 serum samples from 44 patients with PBC, 32 controls with other hepatic disease, and 43 healthy controls. A total of 69 discriminant m/z peaks were identified as being associated with PBC. Of them, the m/z peaks at 3445, 4260, 8133, and 16,290 were used to construct a model for the diagnosis of PBC. This diagnostic model can distinguish PBC from non-PBC controls with a sensitivity of 93.3% and a specificity of 95.1%. In our blind test, it demonstrated good sensitivity and specificity: 92.9% and 82.4%, respectively. These results indicate that useful serum biomarkers for PBC can be discovered by MALDI-TOF-MS combined with the use of magnetic beads and pattern recognition software. The pattern of multiple markers provides a powerful and reliable diagnostic method for PBC with high sensitivity and specificity.","Li, Yong-zhe; Hu, Chao-Jun; Leng, Xiao-Mei; Zhao, Guan-Fei; Li, Ning; Xu, Yang",Anatomical record,https://doi.org/10.1002/ar.20870; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19248174/,570

Suggested measurements used to gauge a quantifiable component of surge capacity and adaptive strategies for staff and supply challenges are proposed. The use of refined definitions of surge capacity as it relates to space, staffing, and supply concerns during a mass casualty incident may aid phased implementation of surge capacity plans at health care facilities and enhance the consistency of terminology and data collection between facilities and regions.","Hick, John L; Barbera, Joseph A; Kelen, Gabor D",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,https://doi.org/10.1097/dmp.0b013e31819f1ae2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19349869/,570

METHODS A retrospective study reviewed morbidly obese patients who underwent LSG between October 2008 and December 2010 to identify patients treated for SS. RESULTS In this study, 230 patients (83% female) with a mean age of 49.5 years and a mean body mass index (BMI) of 43 kg/m(2) underwent LSG. In 3.5% of these patients (100% female; mean age, 42 years; mean BMI, 42.6 kg/m(2)), SS developed. The LSG procedure was performed using a 36-Fr. bougie and tissue-reinforced staplers. Four patients had segmental staple-line imbrication, and seven patients underwent contrast study, with 71.4% demonstrating a fixed narrowing. Endoscopy confirmed short-segment stenoses: seven located at mid-body and one located near the gastroesophageal junction. Endoscopic management was 100% successful. The mean number of dilations was 1.6, and the median balloon size was 15 mm. The mean time from surgery to initial endoscopic intervention was 48.8 days, and the mean time from the first dilation to toleration of a solid diet was 49.6 days. Two patients were referred to our institution after undergoing LSG at another facility. The mean time to the transfer was 28.5 days. The two patients had a mean age of 35 years and a mean BMI of 42.3 kg/m(2). Both patients experienced immediate SS after perioperative complications comprising one staple-line hematoma and one leak. Contrast studies demonstrated minimal passage of contrast through a long-segment stenosis. Both patients underwent multiple endoscopic dilation procedures and endoluminal stenting, ultimately requiring laparoscopic conversion to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. The mean time from the initial surgery to the surgical revision was 77 days, and the mean time after the first intervention to tolerance of a solid diet was 82 days. CONCLUSION Symptomatic short-segment stenoses after LSG may be treated successfully with endoscopic balloon dilation. Long-segment stenoses that do not respond to endoscopic techniques may ultimately require conversion to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.","Parikh, Amit; Alley, Joshua B; Peterson, Richard M; Harnisch, Michael C; Pfluke, Jason M; Tapper, Donovan M; Fenton, Stephen J",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-011-1945-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22044967/,570

109891,Years of Rampant Expansion Have Imposed Darwinian Survival-of-the-Fittest Conditions on US Pharmacy Schools.,2020-10-01,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW The COVID-19 pandemic has had unprecedented global effects, yet the rapid emergence of telehealth across the globe has allowed healthcare professionals to connect virtually with patients and families while following safe social distancing guidelines. Telehealth has been used relatively well in patients from remote regions with limited access to subspecialty healthcare providers. This article discusses novel ways of using telehealth during the current pandemic and measures that would need to be taken to sustain telehealth and teleconsultations. RECENT FINDINGS Telehealth has expanded to outpatient pediatric cardiology clinics across the globe during the pandemic. Technological advancements in video conferencing and the abundance of readily available wearable devices have allowed cardiologists to establish a preliminary diagnosis and set forth a treatment plan. Additional support by insurance providers and relaxation of mandatory regulations by the government have allowed telehealth to succeed during the pandemic. Although many subdisciplines within pediatric cardiology can be easily adapted into a sustainable telehealth model, some unique patient interactions, such as fetal cardiology, exercise physiology, and echocardiograms cannot be done remotely. The field of telehealth medicine with HIPAA-compliant programs and both insurance and government support should remain in our armamentarium of available resources for all patients and families. SUMMARY Although not unique to pediatric cardiology, telehealth has emerged as an avenue to perform an initial evaluation and even establish a care pathway for patients. It is well recognized that telehealth visits will not supplant all patient--physician interactions but is a very acceptable first step in the majority of cases and can often steer the patient to subsequently undergo more selective and streamlined care.","Cohen, Emmie; Cohen, Mitchell I",Current opinion in cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/hco.0000000000000806; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33136662/,570

While early days, we here illustrate a line of research explored by our group-intrusive imagery-based memories after trauma. METHOD/RESULTS We illustrate three possible approaches through which mental health science may stimulate thinking around psychological treatment innovation. First, focusing on single/specific target symptoms rather than full, multifaceted psychiatric diagnoses (e.g., intrusive trauma memories rather than all of posttraumatic stress disorder). Second, investigating mechanisms that can be modified in treatment (treatment mechanisms), rather than those which cannot (e.g., processes only linked to aetiology). Finally, exploring novel ways of delivering psychological treatment (peer-/self-administration), given the prevalence of mental health problems globally, and the corresponding need for effective interventions that can be delivered at scale and remotely for example at times of crisis (e.g., current COVID-19 pandemic). CONCLUSIONS These three approaches suggest options for potential innovative avenues through which mental health science may be harnessed to recouple basic and applied research and transform treatment development.","Singh, Laura; Espinosa, Lisa; Ji, Julie L; Moulds, Michelle L; Holmes, Emily A",Cognitive neuropsychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1080/13546805.2020.1804845; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32847486/,570

The optimal type and duration of prophylactic antithrombotic therapy in these patients remain unknown. METHODS This manuscript reports the final (90-day) results of the Intermediate versus Standard-dose Prophylactic anticoagulation In cRitically-ill pATIents with COVID-19: An opeN label randomized controlled trial (INSPIRATION) study. Patients with COVID-19 admitted to intensive care were randomized to intermediate-dose versus standard-dose prophylactic anticoagulation for 30 days, irrespective of hospital discharge status. The primary efficacy outcome was a composite of adjudicated venous or arterial thrombosis, treatment with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), or all-cause death. The main safety outcome was major bleeding. RESULTS Of 600 randomized patients, 562 entered the modified intention-to-treat analysis (median age [Q1, Q3]; 62 (50, 71) years; 237 (42.2%) women), of whom 336 (59.8%) survived to hospital discharge. The primary outcome occurred in 132 (47.8%) of patients assigned to intermediate-dose and 130 (45.4%) patients assigned to standard-dose prophylactic anticoagulation (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.21, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.95-1.55, P=0.11). No significant differences were observed between the two groups for other efficacy outcomes, or in the landmark analysis from days 31-90. Overall, there were 7 (2.5%) major bleeding events in the intermediate-dose group (including 3 fatal events) and 4 (1.4%) major bleeding events in the standard-dose group (none fatal) (HR: 1.82, 95% CI: 0.53-6.24, P=0.33). CONCLUSION Intermediate-dose compared with standard-dose prophylactic anticoagulation did not reduce a composite of death, treatment with ECMO, or venous or arterial thrombosis at 90-day follow-up.","Bikdeli, Behnood; Talasaz, Azita H; Rashidi, Farid; Bakhshandeh, Hooman; Rafiee, Farnaz; Matin, Samira; Baghizadeh, Elahe; Rezaeifar, Parisa; Jamalkhani, Sepehr; Tahamtan, Ooria; Sharif-Kashani, Babak; Beigmohammadi, Mohammad Taghi; Farrokhpour, Mohsen; Sezavar, Seyed Hashem; Payandemehr, Pooya; Dabbagh, Ali; Gohari Moghadam, Keivan; Khalili, Hossein; Yadollahzadeh, Mahdi; Riahi, Taghi; Abedini, Atefeh; Lookzadeh, Somayeh; Rahmani, Hamid; Zoghi, Elnaz; Mohammadi, Keyhan; Sadeghipour, Pardis; Abri, Homa; Tabrizi, Sanaz; Mousavian, Seyed Masoud; Shahmirzaei, Shaghayegh; Amin, Ahmad; Mohebbi, Bahram; Parhizgar, Seyed Ehsan; Aliannejad, Rasoul; Eslami, Vahid; Kashefizadeh, Alireza; Dobesh, Paul; Kakavand, Hessam; Hosseini, Seyed Hossein; Shafaghi, Shadi; Fattah Ghazi, Samrand; Najafi, Atabak; Jiménez, David; Gupta, Aakriti; Madhavan, Mahesh V; Sethi, Sanjum; Parikh, Sahil A; Monreal, Manuel; Hadavand, Naser; Hajighasemi, Alireza; Maleki, Majid; Sadeghian, Saeed; Piazza, Gregory; Kirtane, Ajay J; Van Tassell, Benjamin W; Stone, Gregg W; Lip, Gregory Yh; Krumholz, Harlan; Goldhaber, Samuel Z; Sadeghipour, Parham",Thrombosis and haemostasis,https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1485-2372; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33865239/,570

125601,Single plus one port robotic radical prostatectomy (SPORP); Initial experience.,2017,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Tumor size is one of the most important issues for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment and prognosis, but the classification of it is still controversial. The aim of this study was to screen appropriate cutoffs for size of solitary hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC. METHODS A cohort of 1760 patients with solitary HBV-related HCC undergoing curative liver resection was divided into 11 groups based on tumor size in 1-cm interval. The minimum p value method was used to screen the appropriate size cutoff according to overall survival (OS). If multiple cutoffs meet the above standard, a univariate analysis will be performed by using the Cox proportional hazards regression model, and hazard ratio (HR) will be considered as a criterion to assess the difference in survival. RESULTS There are 8 dichotomy, 8 trichotomy, and no inquartation cutoffs that were screened when classifying tumor sizes in accordance with OS. The HR values of tumor size at these trichotomy cutoffs for OS were compared, and the highest HR value is 2.79 when size cutoff is 3/9 cm. Then, we reclassified patients into three new classifications: ≤ 3 cm (n = 422), > 3 and ≤ 9 cm (n = 1072), and > 9 cm (n = 266). The comparison of clinicopathologic characteristics among these three classifications showed that the increase of tumor size was associated with the increase of α-fetoprotein (AFP), microvascular invasion (MVI), tumor differentiation, and liver cirrhosis. And the comparison of the OS among three classifications showed statistical differences. CONCLUSIONS This study suggested that size criteria of 3 cm and 9 cm in solitary HBV-related HCC patients were appropriate based on biological characteristics and prognostic significance.","Liu, Hongzhi; Yang, Yuan; Chen, Chuanchun; Wang, Lei; Huang, Qizhen; Zeng, Jianxing; Lin, Kongying; Zeng, Yongyi; Guo, Pengfei; Zhou, Weiping; Liu, Jingfeng",World journal of surgical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12957-020-01963-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32709254/,570

136966,The epidemiology of mycosis fungoides in New Zealand.,2021-05-19,"Influenza viruses are highly infectious and are the leading cause of human respiratory diseases and may trigger severe epidemics and occasional pandemics. Although antiviral drugs against influenza virus have been developed, there is an urgent need to design new strategies to develop influenza virus inhibitors due to the increasing resistance of viruses towards currently available drugs. In this study, we examined the antiviral activity of natural compounds against influenza virus strains: A/WSN/33 (H1N1), A/Udorn/72 (H3N2) and B/Lee/40. Papaverine (a non-narcotic alkaloid that has been used for the treatment of heart disease, impotency and psychosis) was found to be an effective inhibitor of multiple strains of influenza virus. Kinetic studies demonstrated that papaverine inhibited influenza virus infection at a late stage in the virus life cycle. An alteration in influenza virus morphology and viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs) localization was observed as an effect of papaverine treatment. Papaverine is a well-known phosphodiesterase inhibitor and also modifies MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathway by downregulating the phosphorylation of MEK and ERK (Extracellular signal-related kinase). Thus, the modulation of host cell signaling pathways by papaverine may be associated with the nuclear retention of vRNPs and the reduction of influenza virus titers. Interestingly, papaverine also inhibited paramyxoviruses PIV5, HPIV3 and RSV infection. We propose that papaverine can be a potential candidate to be used as an antiviral agent against a broad range of influenza viruses and paramyxoviruses.Importance Influenza viruses are important human pathogens which are the causative agents of epidemics and pandemics. Despite the availability of an annual vaccine, a large number of cases occur every year globally. Here, we report that papaverine, a vasodilator, shows inhibitory action against various strains of influenza virus as well as the paramyxoviruses PIV5, HPIV3 and RSV. A significant effect of papaverine on the influenza virus morphology was observed. Papaverine treatment of influenza virus infected cells resulted in the inhibition of virus at a later time in the virus life cycle through the suppression of nuclear export of vRNP and also interfered with the host cellular cAMP and MEK/ERK cascade pathways. This study explores the use of papaverine as an effective inhibitor of both influenza viruses as well as paramyxoviruses.","Aggarwal, Megha; Leser, George P; Lamb, Robert A",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01888-19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31896588/,570

METHODS This was a randomized double-blinded trial in patients undergoing elective laparoscopic umbilical hernia repair comparing sutured closure of the fascial defect before intraperitoneal onlay mesh (IPOM) repair with a no-closure IPOM repair. Postoperative pain, movement limitations, discomfort and fatigue were registered before surgery and on postoperative days 1-3, 7 and 30. Seroma formation, quality of life and cosmesis were assessed at day 30, and at 2 years of follow-up. Recurrence (clinical and reoperation) and chronic pain were assessed after 2 years. RESULTS Eighty patients were randomized. Median defect sizes in closure and no-closure groups were 2·5 (range 1·5-4·0) and 2·5 (2·0-5·5) cm respectively (P = 0·895). There were no significant differences in early and late postoperative pain or in any other early or late PROMs, except for early fatigue which was higher in the closure group (P = 0·011). Seroma formation after 30 days was significantly reduced after closure (14 of 40; 35 (95 per cent c.i. 22 to 51) per cent) compared with no closure (22 of 38; 58 (42 to 72) per cent) (P = 0·043). Cumulative recurrence after 2 years was lower in the closure group: 5 of 36 (7 (3 to 17) per cent) versus 12 of 37 (19 (10 to 33) per cent) for no closure (P = 0·047).

Retrospective, Match-Paired Case-Control Study.",2019,"INTRODUCTION The COVID-19 pandemic may present special challenges for residential substance use disorder (SUD) treatment facilities, which may lack infrastructure and support to implement infection control protocols while maintaining on-site treatment services. However, little is known about how residential SUD treatment programs are impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS This study conducted semi-structured interviews with 17 directors of 20 residential SUD treatment programs across California during the state's shelter-in-place order. The research team analyzed qualitative interview data thematically and coded them using ATLAS.ti software. FINDINGS Thematic analyses identified six major themes: program-level impacts, staff impacts, client impacts, use of telehealth, program needs, and positive effects. ""Program-level impacts"" were decreased revenue from diminished client censuses and insufficient resources to implement infection control measures. ""Staff impacts"" included layoffs, furloughs, and increased physical and emotional fatigue. ""Client impacts"" were delayed treatment initiation; receipt of fewer services while in treatment; lower retention; and economic and psychosocial barriers to community re-entry. ""Use of telehealth"" included technical and interpersonal challenges associated with telehealth visits. ""Program needs"" were personal protective equipment (PPE), stimulus funding, hazard pay, and consistent public health guidance. ""Positive effects"" of the pandemic response included increased attention to hygiene and health, telehealth expansion, operational improvements, and official recognition of SUD treatment as an essential health care service.

We hypothesized that MAIT cells may have inherent adjuvant activity in vaccine platforms that use replication-incompetent adenovirus vectors. In mice and humans, ChAdOx1 (chimpanzee adenovirus Ox1) immunization robustly activated MAIT cells. Activation required plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC)-derived interferon (IFN)-α and monocyte-derived interleukin-18. IFN-α-induced, monocyte-derived tumor necrosis factor was also identified as a key secondary signal. All three cytokines were required in vitro and in vivo. Activation of MAIT cells positively correlated with vaccine-induced T cell responses in human volunteers and MAIT cell-deficient mice displayed impaired CD8+ T cell responses to multiple vaccine-encoded antigens. Thus, MAIT cells contribute to the immunogenicity of adenovirus vectors, with implications for vaccine design.","Provine, Nicholas M; Amini, Ali; Garner, Lucy C; Spencer, Alexandra J; Dold, Christina; Hutchings, Claire; Silva Reyes, Laura; FitzPatrick, Michael E B; Chinnakannan, Senthil; Oguti, Blanche; Raymond, Meriel; Ulaszewska, Marta; Troise, Fulvia; Sharpe, Hannah; Morgan, Sophie B; Hinks, Timothy S C; Lambe, Teresa; Capone, Stefania; Folgori, Antonella; Barnes, Eleanor; Rollier, Christine S; Pollard, Andrew J; Klenerman, Paul",Science,https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aax8819; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33510029/,570

We included 40 adult patients, who were undergoing elective urological surgery under general anaesthesia. We assessed the ability to differentiate the transilluminated glottis from other structures and found a median (IQR [range]) larynx recognition time of 8 (5-14 [3-28]) s. The difference in laryngeal visibility on the screen between the deactivated vs. activated device expressed on a visual analogue scale was significant (6 (4-7 [2-10]) vs. 10 (8-10 [4-10]); p < 0.001). The number of laryngoscope insertions was 1 (1-2 [1-3]) and the device showed high values on a visual analogue scale ranging from 0 (lowest score) to 10 (highest score) for helpfulness (6 (5-7 [2-10])), credibility (10 (8-10 [5-10])) and ease of use (10 (9-10 [8-10])). Tracheal intubation with the system lasted 26 (16-32 [6-89]) s. No alternative technique of securing the airway was necessary. The lowest SpO2 during intubation was 98 (97-99 [91-100])%.

RECENT FINDINGS Literature from the review period includes case series demonstrating the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RNA in the conjunctival secretions of patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. The global ophthalmology community published reports outlining the enhanced infection control measures undertaken by different institutions around the world to mitigate transmission of the novel coronavirus. Telemedicine has been increasingly implemented in glaucoma practices to reduce in-office patient volume. New data regarding the efficacy and feasibility of tools for home monitoring of intraocular pressure, virtual visual field testing, and remote disc photography are reviewed. SUMMARY COVID-19 has posed a global public health threat due to the severity of its contagion and associated morbidity and mortality. Glaucoma specialists have responded to the pandemic with innovative modifications to reduce viral transmission and optimize patient and staff safety in the office and operating room. The role of teleglaucoma has expanded and will continue to evolve as remote diagnostic devices undergo further refinement and validation.","Vinod, Kateki; Sidoti, Paul A",Current opinion in ophthalmology,https://doi.org/10.1097/icu.0000000000000730; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33315725/,570

METHODS Meta-analysis was conducted using Medcalc 16.8 version software. Standardized mean differences (SMD), odds ratios (OR), and the respective 95% confidence intervals (CI) were determined appropriately. The Cochran Q statistic and the I2 test were used to assess studies' heterogeneity. RESULTS GnRH-agonists were shown to correlate with fewer cancelled IVF/ICSI cycles (p = 0.044, OR = 1.268 > 1, 95% CI 1.007, 1.598), a larger number of embryos transferred (p = 0.008, SMD = - 0.230, 95% CI - 0.400, - 0.0599), and more clinical pregnancies (p = 0.018, OR = 0.748 < 1, 95% CI 0.588, 0.952). However, GnRH-antagonists resulted in a significantly shorter duration of ovarian stimulation (p = 0.007, SMD = - 0.426. 95% CI - 0.736, - 0.115). The number of oocytes and mature oocytes retrieved in both protocols did not differ statistically (p = 0.216, SMD = - 0.130, 95% CI - 0.337, 0.0763 and p = 0.807, SMD = - 0.0203, 95% CI - 0.183, 0.142, respectively). Moreover, a high heterogeneity among studies was observed regarding duration of ovarian stimulation (I2 = 90.6%), number of oocytes (I2 = 82.83%)/mature oocytes retrieved (I2 = 70.39%), and embryos transferred (I2 = 72.83%). CONCLUSIONS Based on the present meta-analysis, agonist protocols could be suggested as a first choice approach, in terms of effectiveness. Due to the high studies' heterogeneity, results should be considered with caution. Accordingly, larger cohort studies and meta-analyses like the present one will enhance the robustness of the emerging results to identify the ideal protocol for poor responders.","Papamentzelopoulou, Myrto; Stavros, Sofoklis; Mavrogianni, Despoina; Kalantzis, Christos; Loutradis, Dimitrios; Drakakis, Petros",Archives of gynecology and obstetrics,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00404-020-05954-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423109/,570

While previous studies have described the distribution and metabolism of the compounds after inhalation, spatial localization in the lungs remains unclear. We visualized two-dimensional spatial localization of CIC and its metabolites in rat lungs after administration of a single dose of a CIC aerosol (with the mass median aerodynamic diameter of 0.918-1.168 μm) using desorption electrospray ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry imaging (DESI-MSI). In the analysis, CIC, des-CIC, and des-CIC-oleate were imaged in frozen lung sections at high spatial and mass resolutions in negative-ion mode. MSI revealed the coexistence of CIC, des-CIC, and des-CIC-oleate on the airway epithelium, and the distribution of des-CIC and des-CIC-oleate in peripheral lung regions. In addition, a part of CIC independently localized on the airway epithelium. These results suggest that distribution of CIC and its metabolites in lungs is related to both the intended delivery of aerosols to pulmonary alveoli and peripheral regions, and the potential deposition of CIC particles on the airway epithelium.","Yamamoto, Eiichi; Taquahashi, Yuhji; Kuwagata, Makiko; Saito, Hirokatsu; Matsushita, Kohei; Toyoda, Takeshi; Sato, Futoshi; Kitajima, Satoshi; Ogawa, Kumiko; Izutsu, Ken-Ichi; Saito, Yoshiro; Hirabayashi, Yoko; Iimura, Yasuo; Honma, Masamitsu; Okuda, Haruhiro; Goda, Yukihiro",International journal of pharmaceutics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2021.120241; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33484917/,570

The study included consecutive patients undergoing lower extremity revascularization due to acute or chronic lower extremity arterial disease. The antibiotic regime was changed in between the two sampling periods (2014 -2016 versus 2016 -2017). The diagnosis of SSI was based on clinical examination and microbiological results, and severity was classified according to the Szilagyi classification. One hundred and twenty-two patients in the cloxacillin/cefotaxime and 67 patients in the TMP-SMX group were included. The SSI rates were 32.0% and 40.3%, respectively (p=0.25). The proportion of women were higher in the TMP-SMX group (32.8% versus 47.8%, respectively, p=0.043). No other differences between the two groups were found regarding patient, vascular surgery procedure characteristics or severity of SSI. Groin infection rate was higher in the TMP-SMX group (15.4% versus 30.5%, respectively, p=0.022). When adjusting for gender, groin infection was more common in the TMP-SMX group (Odds Ratio 2.5, 95% CI 1.1 -5.4).

Our analysis shows that some stations recorded a drop in anthropogenic seismic noise during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the timing of the anthropogenic noise decrease typically correlates with the timing of a strict curtailment of personal and economic activity issued by the local government. In other locations, the drop in the anthropogenic seismic noise appears not to follow the lockdown timing perfectly.Duringour analysis,weobservedthatmanystations didnot recordadropduring the early stageofCOVID-19pandemic. Ofthe 19 stationsof the Southern California Seismic Network that were surveyed, we found that only five show a similar extent of drop in anthropogenic seismic noise comparable to the Christmas holiday break in 2019. This suggests that the human activity that caused seismic noise did not significantly reduce during the COVID-19 pandemic near most surveyed stations in southern California. A further analysis implies that the primary seismic noise source in southern California might be traffic, and the continuation of industrial traffic, such as cargo transportation, during the COVID-19 pandemic may be the reason why many stations did not record a noise drop. Our results show that the anthropogenic seismic noise recorded by seismic stations is capable of indicating human activity, and that thismetric is, particularly, powerful inmeasuring how localized communities initially responded to the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2021 Seismological Society of America.

COVID-19 is currently causing a lot of concern worldwide since it is difficult to detect and prevent. The Internet of Things (IoT) coupled with the wireless sensor network (WSN) has an impact on lowering the medical expenses and improving the treatment results of the infected individual. This paper proposes a secure and energy-efficient WSN architecture combined with machine learning and IoT to recognize and observe the Covid-19 patients. The proposed architecture is designed to determine whether a person has COVID-19 or a typical cold, depending on their symptoms. The proposed architecture utilizes the supervised machine learning techniques such as random forest classifier, multi-layer perceptron, Naive Bayes, logistic regression, support vector machine classifiers to improve the precision of COVID-19 investigation. Energy efficiency is a significant obstacle for the sensor devices' longterm sustainability because signal transmission from many biosensors to the cloud consumes a large amount of energy. The proposed architecture substantially enhances the WSN's power efficiency as well as its longevity.

An Empirical Study in Indonesia,2021,"Stock price movement prediction is commonly accepted as a very challenging task due to the volatile nature of financial markets. Previous works typically predict the stock price mainly based on its own information, neglecting the cross effect among involved stocks. However, it is well known that an individual stock price is correlated with prices of other stocks in complex ways. To take the cross effect into consideration, we propose a deep learning framework, called Multi-GCGRU, which comprises graph convolutional network (GCN) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) to predict stock movement. Specifically, we first encode multiple relationships among stocks into graphs based on financial domain knowledge and utilize GCN to extract the cross effect based on these pre-defined graphs. To further get rid of prior knowledge, we explore an adaptive relationship learned by data automatically. The cross-correlation features produced by GCN are concatenated with historical records and then fed into GRU to model the temporal dependency of stock prices. Experiments on two stock indexes in China market show that our model outperforms other baselines. Note that our model is rather feasible to incorporate more effective stock relationships containing expert knowledge, as well as learn data-driven relationship.","Ye, Jiexia; Zhao, Juanjuan; Ye, Kejiang; Xu, Chengzhong",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.04955v3.pdf,570

However, most models are based on officially reported case numbers, which depend on test availability and test strategies. The time dependence of these factors renders interpretation difficult and might even result in estimation biases. Here, we present a computational modelling framework that allows for the integration of reported case numbers with seroprevalence estimates obtained from representative population cohorts. To account for the time dependence of infection and testing rates, we embed flexible splines in an epidemiological model. The parameters of these splines are estimated, along with the other parameters, from the available data using a Bayesian approach. The application of this approach to the official case numbers reported for Munich (Germany) and the seroprevalence reported by the prospective COVID-19 Cohort Munich (KoCo19) provides first estimates for the time dependence of the under-reporting factor. Furthermore, we estimate how the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions and of the testing strategy evolves over time.

A non-experimental, descriptive, correlational, and explanatory research is presented. According to pathologies of interest, the articles were taken virtually from scientific journals present in Google Scholar and PubMed. The excluded publications were: articles that do not detail the established protocol for detecting SARSCoV-2, studies that do not present a significant number of people with Covid-19 disease, articles that the person has the covid-19 disease but no underlying diseases of nutritional origin. It focused on the vulnerable or higher risk population group, including scientific information from children (over five years old), adults (over 18 years old), and older adults (over 65 years old) found in countries of the Asian and American continents. The R program analyzed the scientific articles using the ggplot2 package with a pie and bar diagram. A higher prevalence in men than women (56% vs. 44%) stood out. Likewise, arterial hypertension was presented in the first place with 40.82%, followed by diabetes with 30.61%, obesity with 12.24%, overweight and dyslipidemia with 6.12%, malnutrition with 4.08%. There was a higher prevalence of stable individuals (29%) within the health facility than those admitted to the ICU (20%). Adults with 69.39%, followed by older adults with 16.33%, and mixed ages with 14.29%. Comorbidities stand out as risk factors in people infected with SARS-CoV-2, regardless of age.

Recent studies led us to ask if HR might have a more central role in replicating the genome of Leishmania, a eukaryotic parasite. Conflicting evidence has emerged regarding whether or not HR genes are essential, and genome-wide mapping has provided evidence for an unorthodox organisation of DNA replication initiation sites, termed origins. To answer this question, we have employed a combined CRISPR/Cas9 and DiCre approach to rapidly generate and assess the effect of conditional ablation of RAD51 and three RAD51-related proteins in Leishmania major. Using this approach, we demonstrate that loss of any of these HR factors is not immediately lethal, but in each case growth slows with time and leads to DNA damage, accumulation of cells with aberrant DNA content, and genome-wide mutation. Despite these similarities, we show that only loss of RAD51 and RAD51-3 impairs DNA synthesis, and that the factors act in distinct ways. Finally, we reveal that loss of RAD51 has a profound effect on DNA replication, causing loss of initiation at the major origins and increased DNA synthesis at subtelomeres. Our work clarifies questions regarding the importance of HR to survival of Leishmania and reveals an unanticipated, central role for RAD51 in the programme of genome replication in a microbial eukaryote.","Damasceno, Jeziel D.; Reis-Cunha, João; Crouch, Kathryn; Lapsley, Craig; Tosi, Luiz R.

170149,"Spread of information versus spread of virus: China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong",2021,"Objective: The common approach to meta-analysis with double-zero studies is to remove such studies. Our previous work has confirmed that exclusion of these studies may impact the results. In this study, we undertook extensive simulations to investigate how the results of meta-analyses would be impacted in relation to the proportion of such studies. Methods: Two standard generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) were employed for the meta-analysis. The statistical properties of the two GLMMs were first examined in terms of percentage bias, mean squared error, and coverage. We then repeated all the meta-analyses after excluding double-zero studies. Direction of estimated effects and p-values for including against excluding double-zero studies were compared in nine ascending groups classified by the proportion of double-zero studies within a meta-analysis. Results: Based on 50,000 simulated meta-analyses, the two GLMMs almost achieved unbiased estimation and reasonable coverage in most of the situations. When excluding double-zero studies, 0.00% to 4.47% of the meta-analyses changed the direction of effect size, and 0.61% to 8.78% changed direction of the significance of p-value. When the proportion of double-zero studies increased in a meta-analysis, the probability of the effect size changed the direction increased; when the proportion was about 40% to 60%, it has the largest impact on the change of p-values. Conclusion: Double-zero studies can impact the results of meta-analysis and excluding them may be problematic. The impact of such studies on meta-analysis varies by the proportion of such studies within a meta-analysis.","Xu, C.; Lin, L.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.23.21262461v1?rss=1,570
170898,Time management during corona virus era,2021,"Amongst the recent documents released by the Greek Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, the one titled 'For the Life of the World', published before the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, touches upon an important section of the life of the Orthodox Church, namely, the social one. As a result of the fact that, so far, there is no official document of the aforementioned Church dedicated to this aspect, whilst the Reformed Churches and the Catholic one have already issued similar documents, I consider the existence of such an article, with all its minuses, important. Moreover, it can constitute a bridge and an invitation to dialogue with other Christian traditions or backgrounds. Being aware of this fact, I have decided to analyse this document in this article to emphasise its influence and its elements of novelty and to speak about both its utility and its weaknesses. As a result of the fact that the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew has had an important contribution to its drafting, I will also try to present this aspect and to show how the ecological vision that he has, amongst other aspects, influenced its content. Contribution: Considering the importance of the recent document 'For the Life of the World of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople', I will try to analyse it and to present its social relevance and meaning.","Morariu, I.

171284,Effects of the non-face-to-face learning on health-related physical fitness and balance in adolescents according to covid-19,2021,"The word stress brings about the thoughts of depression, anxiety and other potentially life-threatening conditions in the mind of an individual. Every person is exposed to stress at some point in their lives, and it is an inevitable part of a students life as it takes a toll on their emotional well-being, academic performance as well as their physical health. Different factors cause stress among students. These include relationships with family and friends, examinations and deadlines, poor time management, social media, financial instability, future career thoughts, depression, anxiety and many more. Educational environments are extremely competitive, and students must be able to deal with academic related stress by relying on their coping capabilities. Most students are unable to cope with stress. This leads to different behavioural patterns such as alcoholism and substance abuse such as dagga (marijuana) and codeine in order to escape the harsh reality. This eventually leads to absentia in school and an increased number of school drop outs. Stress is known to be the source of many problems among youth and its effects can be as toxic as suicide. Therefore, it is important that parents or guardians, teachers, the students themselves and the entire nation unite and ensure that supportive data is communicated to students for them to cope with their stress levels in a responsible manner.","Hachintu, M.; Kasisi, F.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.26.21257875v1?rss=1,570

Similar to the previously deposited structures of SARS-CoV-1 nsp7 at acidic and basic conditions, SARS-CoV-2 nsp7 has a helical bundle folding at neutral pH. Remarkably, the α4 helix shows gradual dislocation from the core α2-α3 structure as pH increases from 6.5 to 7.5. The protonation state of residue H36 contributes to the change of nsp7’s intramolecular interactions, and thus, to the structural variation near-neutral pH. Spin-relaxation results revealed that all three loop regions in nsp7 possess dynamic properties associated with this structural variation.","Lee, Yeongjoon; Tonelli, Marco; Rahimi, Mehdi; Anderson, Thomas K.; Kirchdoerfer, Robert N.; Henzler-Wildman, Katherine; Lee, Woonghee",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.10.459800,570
171655,Social Economy Futures in the Context of COVID-19: Revue Canadienne de Recherche sur les OSBL et l'Économie Sociale (ANSERJ),2021,"SARS-CoV-2 is part of a diverse family of viruses, which mainly affect the respiratory system, central nervous, hepatic, and gastrointestinal systems. The symptoms are fever, cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, confusion, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, and nausea and vomiting. The COVID-19 upheaval has certainly become the most significant issue around the world, and its results have left nobody immaculate. Rapid discoveries, especially in the terms of diagnosing COVID-19 can assist with controlling the infection spread just as additional flare-ups of this infectious diseases. Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) is a golden standard when it comes to diagnosing COVID-19 infection. Novel methods have been developed to overcome time-consuming problems including RT-LAMP and AI-LAMP. On the other hand, various antigen tests are being currently developed. One of the novel ones is the ultrasensitive antigen-based test for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein detection. Furthermore, the Panbio test detects nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal samples. Next, Field-Effect Transistor (FET) based biosensors are very attractive due to their high sensitivity and instant measurements with small amounts of needed analytes. Moreover, the peak of rapid testing is a device that can detect COVID-19 in exhaled breath, making it the fastest and easiest test to run. Up to this day, “Breathonix” and “Scentech Medical” companies alongside professor Niann Sun developed breath analyzers that are still in the testing phase. In this paper, we review novel methods for diagnosing COVID-19, including the RT-PCR. The advantages, as well as disadvantages of the mentioned methods, are included in this paper. Data on COVID-19 are evolving rapidly. Considering science and technology’s swift development, some of the specifics in this review could be changed as more studies become available. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Abdukić, T.; Bego, T.; Meseldžić, N.; Planinić, M.; Pulo, E.; Šehić, F.","International Conference on Medical and Biological Engineering in Bosnia and Herzegovina, CMBEBIH 2021",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-73909-6_97,570

After the COVID-19 vaccines are widely used, rare and potentially severe vaccine complications become more manifest. Here reported is a case of rapid and severe worsening of diabetes after the Johnson & Johnson's Janssen COVID-19 vaccine (J&J COVID vaccine) administration. A 55-year-old male heart transplant recipient with metformin (500 mg twice daily)-controlled mild diabetes started to have flu-like symptoms a few days after receiving the J&J COVID vaccine. His fasting glucose levels had ranged between 130-150 mg/dL (normal 65-99) before he received the J&J COVID vaccine. The fasting glucose rose to ~200 mg/dL one day after the vaccine administration and gradually rose to ~400 mg/dL over the next few weeks. He presented to the endocrine clinic urgently. Point-of-care fasting glucose was 382 mg/dL and A1c 13.0 (which was 6.7 six months before). Bicarbonate and anion gap were normal, insulin and C-peptide in the low normal range, and β cell autoantibodies negative. Multi-dosing insulin treatment was immediately started and the doses titrated up to insulin glargine 30 units daily and insulin lispro 10 units before each meal. He improved clinically with well-controlled glycemia. The rapid and severe worsening of his diabetes after the vaccination suggests that the J&J COVID vaccine could severely deteriorate diabetes control in some patient populations.","Yu, R.",International Medicine,https://doi.org/10.5455/im.79278,570

ObjectiveTo evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of FDA authorized serology tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Data sourcesA search of MEDLINE, SCOPUS, CINAHL Plus, and EMBASE up to April 4, 2020, was performed to identify studies using the ""COVID 19 testing"" and ""meta-analysis."" FDA website was accessed for the list of tests for emergency use authorization (EUA). Study SelectionManufacturer reported serology tests published in the FDA website were selected. Two reviewers independently assessed the eligibility of the selected reports. Data extraction and synthesisThe meta-analysis was performed in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. A bivariate analysis using the ""random-effects model"" was applied for pooled summary estimates of sensitivity, specificity, and the summary receiver operating characteristic curves. Main outcomes and measuresThe primary outcome was the diagnostic accuracy of the serology test for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection. Subgroup analysis of the diagnostic accuracy with lag time between symptom onset and testing were studied. ResultsSeven manufacturer listed reports were included. The pooled sensitivity was 87% (95% CI, 78% - 93%), the pooled specificity was 100% (95% CI, 97% - 100%), and the area under the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.97. At [â¤] 7 days, sensitivity was 44% (95% CI, 21% - 70%), and for 8-14 days, sensitivity was 84% (95% CI, 67 % - 94%).For blood draws [â¥] 15 days after the onset of symptoms, sensitivity was 96% (95% CI, 93% - 98%). Heterogeneity was substantial, and the risk of bias was low in this analysis. Conclusions and relevanceFDA authorized serology tests demonstrate high diagnostic accuracy for SARS-CoV-2 infection (certainty of evidence: moderate). There is a wide variation in the test accuracy based on the duration between the onset of symptoms and the tests (certainty of evidence: low). Key- points QuestionsWhat is the pooled diagnostic accuracy of FDA authorized serology tests to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies? FindingsIn this systematic review and meta-analysis of seven reports from FDA authorized serology tests to detect antibodies against SARS-CoV2 antibodies (3336 patients/ samples) pooled sensitivity was 87%, and pooled specificity was almost 100%. There was a wide variation in test performance based on the duration between the onset of symptoms and the tests. MeaningFDA authorized tests are highly accurate to detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 antibodies if tests are performed under a similar condition, as presented in the original report. There is a wide variation in the test performance based on the time interval between the onset of symptoms to the tests.","Pandey, Rajesh; Gourishankar, Anand",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.07.20208553,570

174785,Political polarization and selective exposure of social media users in indonesia,2021,"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) clears the brain's interstitial spaces, and disruptions in CSF flow or egress impact homeostasis, contributing to various neurological conditions. Here, we recast the human cribriform plate from innocuous bony structure to complex regulator of CSF egress with an apical role in Alzheimer's disease etiology. It includes the pathological evaluation of 70 post-mortem samples using high-resolution contrast-enhanced micro-CT and cutting-edge machine learning, a novel ferret model of neurodegeneration, and a clinical study with 560 volunteers, to provide conclusive evidence of a relationship between cribriform plate aging/pathology and cognitive impairment. Interstitial spaces within the medial temporal lobe and basal forebrain are cleared by CSF flow that drains through olfactory structures to the olfactory bulb, directly above the cribriform plate. We characterized CSF flow channels from subarachnoid spaces under the olfactory bulb to the nasal mucosa through subarachnoid evaginations that subdivide into tiny tubules that connect to an elaborate conduit system within the cribriform plate. These conduits form an internal watershed that runs from the crista galli's vault to a bony manifold within the olfactory fossa's back wall, connecting with large apertures in between. We found that the cross-sectional area of apertures limits CSF flux through the cribriform plate, which declines with increasing age. Subjects with a confirmed post-mortem diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease had the smallest CSF flux capacity, which reduces CSF-mediated clearance in upstream areas and leads to the accumulation of toxic macromolecules that seen AD pathology. We surgically occluded apertures in adult ferrets and found that this manipulation induced progressive deficits in spatiotemporal memory and significant atrophy of the temporal lobe, olfactory bulbs, and lateral olfactory stria. Finally, we explored human cribriform plate aging/pathology and cognition in a clinical study with 560 participants (20-95y). We evaluated cribriform plate morphology with CT and Deep Learning, assessed memory with a novel touch screen platform, tested olfactory discrimination, and asked questions about family history and relevant life events, like broken noses. Deep learning algorithms effectively parsed subjects and established the feasibility of predicting Alzheimer's disease years before a clinical presentation of cognitive impairment. This study provides a new perspective of the cribriform plate as a critical regulator of CSF egress and brain homeostasis.","Zaragoza, R.; Miulli, D.; Kashyap, S.; Carson, T.

Twenty-nine client-owned dogs with NeuP were included in a prospective, partially masked, randomized crossover clinical trial, and treated with gabapentin/placebo/gabapentin-meloxicam or gabapentin-meloxicam/placebo/gabapentin (each treatment block of 7 days; total 21 days). Pain scores, mechanical (MNT) and electrical (ENT) nociceptive thresholds and descending noxious inhibitory controls (DNIC) were assessed at baseline, days 7, 14, and 21. DNIC was evaluated using ΔMNT (after-before conditioning stimulus). Positive or negative ΔMNT corresponded to inhibitory or facilitatory pain profiles, respectively. Data from baseline were compared to those of sixteen healthy controls. ΔMNT, but not MNT and ENT, was significantly larger in controls (2.3 ± 0.9 N) than in NeuP (−0.2 ± 0.7 N). The percentage of dogs with facilitatory sensory profile was similar at baseline and after placebo (61.5-63%), and between controls and after gabapentin (33.3-34.6%). Pain scores were lower than baseline after gabapentin or gabapentin-meloxicam. Cytokine levels were not different between groups or treatments.

This study was aimed to describe the clinico-demographic, hematological, and comorbidity profile in a group of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients at a tertiary care center in north India. Materials and Methods: We conducted a prospective, single-center collection of data regarding clinico-epidemiological, hematological parameters, and comorbidity profile of COVID-19 patients admitted at a tertiary care facility. Results: Data from 200 patients with COVID-19 were collected and analyzed. The median age of the patients was 48 years, with 63% males, and 78% patients were from urban area. Ten patients were smokers while 11 patients were alcoholic. The occupation of 20.6% of patients was related directly or indirectly with medical or allied professions. The most common mode of transmission of COVID-19 was direct close contact with microbiologically confirmed patients. Fever (n = 93;46.5%) was the most common presenting symptom and the median duration of onset of symptoms before admission were 3.5 days (range 2-6 days). In hematological profile, lymphopenia (n = 48;24%) had been the most common documented finding. Comorbidities were present in 39 (19.5%) patients, of which diabetes mellitus (n = 25;12.5%) was the most common. Furthermore, the case fatality rate in our study was 1.5%.

Design: A pragmatic pre-post design study examined physiotherapy services across two three-month periods: current service delivery [P1] and current service delivery plus AHA [P2]. Outcome measures: Clinical and non-clinical activity contributing to physiotherapy services delivery quantified as number, type and duration (per day) of all staff activity, and categorised for skill level (AHA, junior, senior). Results: Overall physiotherapy service delivery increased in P2 compared to P1 (n=4730 vs n=3048). Physiotherapists undertook fewer respiratory (p < 0.001) and exercise treatments (p < 0.001) but increased patient reviews for inpatients (p < 0.001) and at multidisciplinary clinics in P2 (56% vs 76%, p < 0.01). The AHA accounted for 20% of all service provision. AHA activity comprised mainly non-direct clinical care including oversight of respiratory equipment use (e.g. supply, set-up, cleaning, loan audits) and other patient related administrative tasks associated with delegation handovers, supervision and clinical documentation (72%) and delegated supervision of established respiratory (5%) and exercise treatments (10%) and delegated exercise tests (3%). The AHA completed most of the exercise tests (n = 25). AHA non-direct clinical tasks included departmental management activities such as statistics and ongoing training (11%). No adverse events were reported. Conclusion: Inclusion of an AHA in an acute respiratory care service changed physiotherapy service provision. The AHA completed delegated routine clinical and non-clinical tasks. Physiotherapists increased clinic activity and annual reviews. Including an AHA role offers safe and sustainable options for enhancing physiotherapy service provision in acute respiratory care services.","Hall, K.

176678,Conclusion: emerging issues for Indian hospitality and tourism businesses: How are managers responding to the COVID-19 pandemic?,2021,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) originally emerged from Hubei province, Wuhan, China, and has caused a worldwide pandemic with millions affected since December 2019. Since the first case of SARS-CoV-2 reported on 27th Jan 2020 in India, over 11 million people have been affected by the virus in the country in the past one year. To understand its demographic distribution, in this study we carried out the early distribution of clades and subclades state-wise based on the analysis of shared mutations in Indian SARS-CoV-2 isolates collected during the period 27th Jan – 27th May 2020. A total of 1279 mutations have been identified in 685 Indian isolates during this period. Principal component analysis on the mutational profile of Indian isolates revealed clusters corresponding to Nextstrain’s clades and some state-specific clusters. Phylogenetic analysis of these isolates indicates multiple independent sources of introduction of the virus in the country. It is observed that clade 20A defining mutations C241T (ORF1ab: 5′UTR), C3037T (ORF1ab: F924F), C14408T (ORF1ab: P4715L), and A23403G (S: D614G) are the predominant mutation set in Indian isolates during this period. Higher number of coronavirus cases were observed in certain states, viz., Delhi, Tamil Nadu, and Telangana. Genetic analysis of isolates from these states revealed a cluster with shared mutations, C6312A (ORF1ab: T2016K), C13730T (ORF1ab: A4489V), C23929T, and C28311T (N: P13L).

177062,Some turning points in the early sociology of Robert King Merton,2021,"There has been growing concern about high risk of airborne infection during wind instrument performance as the COVID-19 pandemic evolves. In collaboration with 16 musicians from the Minnesota Orchestra, we employ multiple experimental and numerical techniques to quantify the airflow and aerosol concentration emitted from ten wind instruments under realistic performance conditions. For all instruments, the extent of the flow and aerosol influence zones are limited to 30 cm. Further away, the thermal plume generated by the human body is the dominant source of flow. Flow and aerosol concentration vary in response to changes in music amplitude, pitch, and note duration, depending on playing technique and instrument geometry. Covering the trumpet bell with speaker cloth and placing filters above the instrument outlet can substantially reduce the aerosol concentration. Our findings indicate that with appropriate risk mitigation strategies, musical instrument performance can be conducted with low risk of airborne disease transmission.","Abraham, A.; He, R.; Shao, S.; Kumar, S.

178093,The Effect of COVID-19 on Investment Decisions in Saudi Stock Market,2021,"Purpose: The rapidly changed global context for internationalization (IZN) over the next decade prompted a decision to use a futurist perspective for identifying issues to be considered in the organization’s next strategic plan. This paper aims to report on this project to identify current and strategic issues influencing the future strategy of the higher education (HE) IZN for Thailand on behalf of the Bureau of International Cooperation Strategy and the Office of the Higher Education Commission. Design/methodology/approach: The research approach was a customized version of the University of Houston’s Framework Foresight method. It involved framing the domain with a description and domain map, scanning for signals of change within the domain and emerging issues analysis to produce a set of current and emerging issues. A planning step synthesizes a set of recommended actions. Findings: The key findings reported in this paper are the identification of 14 current and emerging issues influencing the future of the IZN of HE in Thailand. The issues were organized along with the three horizons framework: H1: how are we [currently] doing? H2: what should we do next and H3, where do we want to go? The primary recommendation of this research reported on in this study is to consider the 14 issues for inclusion into the next strategic plan. Seven specific strategic options mapped over three phases were identified as well. The research reported here was carried out for Thailand, but the process could easily be adapted by other countries and other topics. Research limitations/implications: The modified version of the University of Houston Framework Foresight approach has been applied successfully to many topics. The topic explored here is focused on one nation, Thailand. The authors feel the lessons are, however, broadly applicable. Practical implications: The ability to use a futurist perspective to identify current and emerging issues is highlighted. The organizing of the issues using the three horizons framework proved to be particularly useful in helping the client to develop a sense of timing regarding the future, that is, when and to what degree to pay attention to the many issues that typically confront any organization. Originality/value: The use of the three horizons framework in the analysis of the emerging issues provide benefits in two ways in situating the likely timing of signals of change in horizon scanning and “scan hits” both scanning for the identification of issues and organizing the resulting current and emerging issues along the three horizons with H1 current issues: how are we [currently] doing?;H2 emerging issues: what should we do next and H3 emerging issues, where do we want to go? The paper also includes a section exploring the impact of Covid-19 on the likely timing of the issues identified just before the pandemic hit, finding that timing of some issues would speed up, some would stay the same and some would slow down. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Hines, A.; Dockiao, L.",On the Horizon,https://doi.org/10.1108/oth-03-2021-0044,570

We investigated the plasma lipidome for markers of severity and nutritional status in critically ill children. Children with multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) (n=24) were analyzed at three time points and cross referenced to sedation controls (n = 4) for a total of N=28. Eight of the patients with MODS, needed veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA ECMO) support to survive. Blood plasma lipid profiles were quantified by nano-electrospray (nESI), direct infusion high resolution/accurate mass spectrometry (MS), and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and compared to nutritional profiles and PEdiatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction (PELOD) scores. PELOD scores were not significantly different between MODS and ECMO cases across time-points (p = 0.66). Lipid profiling provided stratification between sedation controls and all MODS patients for lysophosphatidylserine (lysoPS) (p-value = 0.004), total phosphatidylserine (PS) (p-value = 0.015), and total ether-linked phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) (p-value = 0.03). Phospholipids in patients needing ECMO were observably closer to sedation controls than other MODS patients. Nutrition intake revealed changes in lipid profiles that corresponded to calorie and protein intake. Lipid measurement in the intensive care environment shows dynamic changes over an 8-day PICU course, suggesting novel indicators for defining critically ill children.","Leimanis-Laurens, M.

179127,Pengaruh personal traits pegawai terhadap kepuasan kerja work from home (WFH) saat pandemi COVID-19,2021,"Natural language descriptions sometimes accompany visualizations to better communicate and contextualize their insights, and to improve their accessibility for readers with disabilities. However, it is difficult to evaluate the usefulness of these descriptions, and how effectively they improve access to meaningful information, because we have little understanding of the semantic content they convey, and how different readers receive this content. In response, we introduce a conceptual model for the semantic content conveyed by natural language descriptions of visualizations. Developed through a grounded theory analysis of 2,147 sentences, our model spans four levels of semantic content: enumerating visualization construction properties (e.g., marks and encodings); reporting statistical concepts and relations (e.g., extrema and correlations); identifying perceptual and cognitive phenomena (e.g., complex trends and patterns); and elucidating domain-specific insights (e.g., social and political context). To demonstrate how our model can be applied to evaluate the effectiveness of visualization descriptions, we conduct a mixed-methods evaluation with 30 blind and 90 sighted readers, and find that these reader groups differ significantly on which semantic content they rank as most useful. Together, our model and findings suggest that access to meaningful information is strongly reader-specific, and that research in automatic visualization captioning should orient toward descriptions that more richly communicate overall trends and statistics, sensitive to reader preferences. Our work further opens a space of research on natural language as a data interface coequal with visualization.","Lundgard, Alan; Satyanarayan, Arvind",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.04406v1.pdf,570

Methods Dancers from a ballet company completed a published, online dance-specific health questionnaire. Over the study period, dancers recorded wellbeing and training metrics, with menstrual cycle tracking and capillary blood testing for the recognised indicators of low energy availability. At regular, virtual clinical discussions with each dancer, findings were discussed and personalised advice given. Results Twenty dancers participated in the study (mean age 26.2 years, SD 3.7), comprising 14 females (mean age 25.5 years, SD 3.7) and 6 males (mean age 27.7 years, SD 2.4). Ten of the female and all the male dancers recorded positive scores on the dance health questionnaire, suggesting a low risk of relative energy deficiency in sport (RED-S). Two female dancers were taking hormonal contraception. Apart from one, all female dancers not on hormonal contraception reported current eumenorrhoeic status. Blood testing confirmed the low risk of insufficient energy availability across the group, apart from female dancers with negative questionnaire scores. The initiative of monitoring menstrual cycles and on demand virtual clinical support was well received by dancers, healthcare and artistic staff. Conclusions Multimodal monitoring facilitated delivery of prompt personalised clinical medical feedback specific for dance. This interactive strategy permitted the early identification and swift management of emergent clinical issues. Dancers highly rated the new monitoring modalities and opportunity to discuss health and well-being, in confidence, with a doctor conversant in dance.","Keay, N.; Lanfear, M.; Francis, G.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.09.25.21263895v1?rss=1,570

During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the aerosol-generating nature of spirometry coupled with service user shielding disrupted its routine monitoring. To maintain continuity, we implemented a home spirometry service to complement our telemedicine clinic. Methods: We provided NuvoAir Air Next© home spirometers in clinic or by courier to those of our adult CF cohort with good service engagement and spirometry technique. Training and instruction was given by ARTP-registered physiologists, who are also available at telemedicine clinics to grade spirometry and offer support to service users. Results are uploaded by pwCF via a connected phone. We report our experiences, and the quality of independently-performed home spirometry as graded against ATS/ERS guidelines. Results: Over 4 months, we provided 302 of the 354 pwCF attending our centre with spirometers ([mean ± SD] age 32 ± 11 years (range 17–76), BMI 23.4 ± 4 kgm–2, % predicted FEV1 76.5 ± 23.6. Of the 300, 2 did not tolerate home spirometry, one due to an incompatible phone, and one due to poor compliance. 20 (6.8%) pwCF have yet to use their spirometer. 278 (93%) have performed a total of 5,344 manoeuvres across 1,636 sessions (mean sessions 5.8, mean interval 14.9 days, see Table). We report no adverse events. Quality of spirometry below grade D was often repeated after physiologist feedback. Grade E spirometry was often recorded when only a single acceptable spirometry was performed (20%) or when end-of-test criteria had not been met (46.4%). [Table Presented] Conclusion: Home spirometry can be implemented in a large cohort in a short time frame. Engagement and quality of independently performed spirometry in this group of expert performers was high, but falls below that of hospital quality spirometry. The availability of physiologists to support this service in real-time is an important factor in this and in the reinforcement of reproducible spirometry.","Hawkes, S.; Peat, R.; FitzMaurice, T.

Since the beginning of 2020, the sudden outbreak of the COVID-19 has affected everyone around the world. Thermometers have played a crucial role in the fight against the pandemic. For example, public places like airports and stations are all equipped with necessary temperature-measuring devices such as medical thermometers, infrared ear thermometers, and thermal imagers. Traditional mercury thermometers not only easily break, but also take a long time to measure body temperature and are difficult to read. As staffers need to be assigned to measure people's temperature, infrared ear thermometers and thermal imagers increase the chances of cross infection and are unable to provide real-time and continuous data, making temperature monitoring and management during the pandemic much more difficult. This paper will introduce an intelligent mobile body temperature monitoring and management system (IMBTMMS) particularly designed for nursing homes. Besides monitoring body temperature on a real-time and continuous basis, the system also provides heart rate and blood oxygen data and intelligently recommends relaxing music solutions. The sensor pad is connected to the mobile app via Bluetooth, with the server on the cloud integrated with an advanced artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm. By regularly processing body temperature, heart rate, and blood oxygen data, the system offers real-time and continuous monitoring, forecasting, warning, and management services. Targeting at use in nursing home, the system enables large-scale monitoring and management, which greatly eases the shortage of manpower during the pandemic and reduces the risk of cross infection. Finally, the system is highly extendable as it can be connected with offline and online medical services, which can be customized as per different demands. © 2021 IEEE.","Cui, C.; Wang, C.; Dong, X.; An, Z.","6th IEEE International Conference on Computer and Communication Systems, ICCCS 2021",https://doi.org/10.1109/icccs52626.2021.9449137,570

The results show that the spillover between markets under investigation is time-varying, asymmetric, and crisis-sensitive. Furthermore, short-term return spillovers dominate the intermediate- and long-term spillovers. In contrast, long-term volatility spillovers constitute the principal proportion of the total volatility spillovers. COVID-19 and GFC intensify more the long-term volatility spillovers than short- and medium-terms. Wheat is the better portfolio diversfier among the four commodities irrespective of the investment horizons. Liquidity shocks show a stronger impact on the return and volatility spillover strengths than the economic policy uncertainty and volatility index.

This teaching note introduces an elective course open to both Master of Social Work and doctoral students to develop holistic competence for socially just and culturally competent social work practice. We describe how the course originally designed in an in-person format was redesigned and adapted to an online format during the COVID-19 pandemic. Another consideration during this transition is how this requires social work students who are adult learners to balance family, work, and school demands while attending virtual classrooms in a personal space during physical distancing. We explain metacompetence and procedural competence, which are two competence dimensions conceptualized in the holistic competence model. Each competence dimension was targeted through a variety of synchronous and asynchronous virtual teaching approaches (e.g., intergroup dialog, digital storytelling, and virtual simulation). While these teaching approaches may be applicable to other online courses, we highlight specific considerations for teaching social justice online. We close with a discussion of challenges and new lessons from teaching social justice in social work practice courses online and provide recommendations for future teaching and research.

In this article, we discuss the intersection of the social psychology concepts of therapeutic holding spaces and containment with more-than-human theory as it relates to Australia's mental health sector during the COVID-19 crisis. Drawing on our recent qualitative survey research into Australian psychologists' use of telepsychology during the crisis, we consider the ways that they worked to build and maintain therapeutic holding spaces and alliances over teleconferencing platforms during this extraordinary time of social crisis and isolation. We explore and contextualise three important findings from our study: 1) the limited viewing area of a flat screen makes it difficult for therapists to read and respond to their client's body language and requires different forms of returned bodily gestures in order to show empathy;2) most respondents implemented different affective and relational strategies online to ensure they were not missing important non-verbal cues from their clients;and 3) the traditionally ‘safe’ therapeutic holding space created in face-to-face therapy can be easily subverted by client-end interruptions, and concerns around safety or personal privacy in the client's home environment. In bringing these issues to the fore, we highlight the online therapeutic holding space as a temporally and socially situated human-technological assemblage in which a series of affective, spatial, relational and sense-making agencies coverage, opening or closing off capacities for therapists and their clients. © 2021","Downing, L.; Marriott, H.; Lupton, D.","Emotion, Space and Society",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.emospa.2021.100824,570

Leveraging self-reported survey outcomes via an existing international social media network has the potential to provide reliable and standardized data streams to support monitoring and decision-making world-wide, in real time, and with limited local resources. The University of Maryland Global COVID Trends and Impact Survey (UMD-CTIS), in partnership with Facebook, invites daily cross-sectional samples from the social media platform's active users to participate in the survey since launch April 23, 2020. COVID-19 indicators through December 20, 2020, from N=31,142,582 responses representing N=114 countries, weighted for nonresponse and adjusted to basic demographics, were benchmarked with government data. COVID-19-related signals showed similar concordance with reported benchmark case and test positivity. Bonferroni significance and minimal Spearman correlation strength thresholds were met in the majority. Light Gradient Boost machine learning trained on national and pooled global data verified known symptom indicators, and predicted COVID-19 trends similar to other signals. Risk mitigation behavior trends are correlated with, but sometimes lag, risk perception trends. In regions with strained health infrastructure, but active social media users, we show it is possible to define suitable COVID-19 impact trajectories.

Background: Differential diagnosis and management for perforated appendicitis and non-perforated appendicitis and the infectious etiology of appendicitis are current hot topics. Methods: Field investigation for Tibetan students were carried out and reports published in English and Chinese medical journals were reviewed. Results: The literature review included 473 patients in 7 cluster/outbreaks of appendicitis in 6 provinces and autonomous regions. All the clusters/outbreaks occurred in group living units. We found two classic entities of appendicitis with natural history from non perforated appendicitis to perforated appendicitis and two entities of non-perforated appendicitis . In classic entities, one may represent majority of sporadic patients and the other may represent partial sporadic patients with obvious gastrointestinal manifestation. In entities of non-perforated appendicitis, one was identical to features of sporadic non-perforated appendicitis and the other one is identical to the following Tibetan students and associated with Fusobacterium. The field investigation for 120 Tibetan students with appendicitis showed that the resected appendices exhibited diffuse or focal hemorrhages and infiltration by eosinophils and by lymphocytes. Most patients had normal body temperature, white blood cell count and neutrophil count. This is a new entity of appendicitis. The clusters/outbreaks of appendicitis showed the features of infectious disease in epidemiology. The entity of perforated appendicitis was not found.

184573,Challenge for COVID-19 vaccines to protect the New Zealand population.,2021-04-30,"Existing compartmental-logistics models in epidemics control are limited in terms of optimizing the allocation of vaccines and treatment resources under a risk-averse objective. In this paper, we present a data-driven, mean-risk, multi-stage, stochastic epidemics-vaccination-logistics model that evaluates various disease growth scenarios under the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) risk measure to optimize the distribution of treatment centers, resources, and vaccines, while minimizing the total expected number of infections, deaths, and close contacts of infected people under a limited budget. We integrate a new ring vaccination compartment into a Susceptible-Infected-Treated-Recovered-Funeral-Burial epidemics-logistics model. Our formulation involves uncertainty both in the vaccine supply and the disease transmission rate. Here, we also consider the risk of experiencing scenarios that lead to adverse outcomes in terms of the number of infected and dead people due to the epidemic. Combining the risk-neutral objective with a risk measure allows for a tradeoff between the weighted expected impact of the outbreak and the expected risks associated with experiencing extremely disastrous scenarios. We incorporate human mobility into the model and develop a new method to estimate the migration rate between each region when data on migration rates is not available. We apply our multi-stage stochastic mixed-integer programming model to the case of controlling the 2018–2020 Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) using real data. Our results show that increasing the risk-aversion by emphasizing potentially disastrous outbreak scenarios reduces the expected risk related to adverse scenarios at the price of the increased expected number of infections and deaths over all possible scenarios. We also find that isolating and treating infected individuals are the most efficient ways to slow the transmission of the disease, while vaccination is supplementary to primary interventions on reducing the number of infections. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that vaccine acceptance rates affect the optimal vaccine allocation only at the initial stages of the vaccine rollout under a tight vaccine supply.","Yin, X.; Büyüktahtakın, Iacute; E.,",IISE Transactions on Healthcare Systems Engineering,https://doi.org/10.1080/24725579.2021.1938298,570

Bamboo attaches itself to the minds of the Vietnamese people with villages, thatched roofs and bamboo roofs that are present in everything that belong to the Vietnamese environment and living environment. Bamboo is associated with community activities and creates many values in interior architecture design. The bamboo constructions are increasingly favored because it is not only a work but also a precious yield of art, a work of humanity and sustainability. However, this article only emphasizes the value and how to put bamboo materials into the components of the interior space: walls, ceilings and floors. The inherent properties of bamboo and advances in manufacturing techniques have resulted in high-value consumer products such as bamboo flooring and bamboo furniture to replace laminate flooring and wood furniture, offering more benefits to society and the environment. The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic is huge and comprehensive globally, especially on development issues and development trends. The impact of the Covid-19 epidemic had a lot to do with the way of life and working of many organizations, individuals, many industries, including interior design. Research and use of healthy, non-viral materials in interior design and construction are very interested in the current period. In addition to industrial materials manufactured with antibacterial technology, bamboo materials are considered to be the optimal solution to exploit and put into use in the interior, especially they are used to make walls and floors as a Practical solution for limiting the influence of viruses. Therefore, the use of environmentally friendly materials, healthy materials such as bamboo is essential. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.","Van, N. T.

This is the gene encoding the major protein component of the A-type inclusion bodies produced by this virus. This gene (designated the 160K gene) is transcribed late during the infection. Analyses of its mRNAs showed that these late RNAs, unlike all other characterized late mRNAs of poxviruses, are uniform in length. However, the most remarkable feature of the mRNAs of the 160K gene is the structure of their 5'-termini. Most of these mRNAs have 5'-terminal poly(A) sequences containing 5-21 residues. Furthermore, these 5'-terminal poly(A) sequences are not complementary to the corresponding region of the template strand of the viral DNA. Instead, the nucleotide sequences of the mRNA and the viral DNA diverge at the site of the three As in the sequence 5'-TAAATG-3' containing the gene's initiation codon. Consequently, the poly(A) provides the leader sequences of these mRNAs. These unusual 5'-terminal structures suggest that the late mRNAs of pox-virus genes are generated by a novel process.","Patel, D D; Pickup, D J",EMBO J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC553850/,570

This epitope includes amino acids 198, 199 and 201, as determined by selection of IIB4 escape mutants, and is involved in haemagglutination-inhibition (HI) and virus-neutralization (VN). We have developed anti-idiotypic MAbs (Ab2) that mimic the IIB4 epitope. Two Ab2, 78 and 464, completely inhibited binding of MAb IIB4 to the virus. Nucleotide sequences of VL- and VH-encoding regions were determined for IIB4 and both Ab2. VH of IIB4 and 78 belong to the same IgG family (VII) and show high nucleotide identity (89%). Conversely, VH and VL sequences of both internal image-bearing Ab2 revealed lower degrees of identity (61 and 50%, respectively). Ab2 were used for syngeneic immunization to elicit polyclonal Ab3 responses. Like Ab1, Ab3 immunoprecipitated viral HA and displayed HI and VN activity. The different VN activity of anti-78 and anti-464 in vitro correlated with the affinities of their corresponding Ab2 to IIB4. In vivo immunization with either Ab2 protected 15-37% of mice against lethal influenza infection or delayed dying. In contrast to VN activity of Ab3 in vitro, there was no significant difference between the protection of mice induced by Ab2 78 and 464. We demonstrate, for the influenza model, that active immunization with a single influenza virus HA epitope in the form of its internal image leads to partial protection in vivo.","Betáková, T; Varecková, E; Kostolanský, F; Mucha, V; Daniels, R S",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9519824/,570
187570,[Efficacy of serological tests for COVID-19 in asymptomatic HD patients: the experience of an Italian hemodialysis unit].,2020-10-05,"INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND The novel coronavirus or commonly referred to as the covid-19, has been a threat to the global health as well as the world economy. It all started from the Wuhan city of china in December 2019, when a cluster of pneumonia cases with severe acute respiratory symptoms were reported with unknown etiology, majority of cases linked to the exposure to wholesale seafood market in Hunan. On January 7th, after the nomenclature of this causative agent was done as Corona Virus Disease 2019, COVID19, the struggles to combat and try to control this illness have only so far been less helpful as more and more countries have exponential proportion of cases. On the other side of the illness are the efforts being done constantly to study the characteristics of the virus, newer treatment agents, expanding testing facilities and finally to find a vaccine as soon as possible. Although most human coronavirus infections are mild, the epidemics of the two beta corona viruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)20-24 have caused more than 10 000 cumulative cases in the past two decades, with mortality rates of 10% for SARS-CoV and 37% for MERS-CoV. The 2019-nCoV has features typical of the coronavirus family and was classified in the beta coronavirus. Four viruses - (HCoV 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1) are endemic globally and account for 10% to 30% of upper respiratory tract infections in adults and typically cause common cold symptoms in immunocompetent individuals. Currently, the patients infected by the novel coronavirus are the main source of infection. Although asymptomatic infected can also be a source. Transmission of the virus happens mainly through respiratory droplets and close contact (defined as that within 1m distance and lasting for several minutes). A possibility of aerosol transmission in a relatively closed environment for a long-time exposure to high concentrations has also not been denied as of yet. Since the information regarding the illness, the treatment principles have been in constant scrutiny and have been changed dynamically as we get to know more about the virus, studies of covid19 cases would be a major stepping stone in acquiring maximum if not hundred percent knowledge about covid19. MATERIALS AND METHODS An observational retrospective case study was done for a fixed duration of a month i.e from 23/05/2020 to 23/06/2020. Patients satisfying the inclusion and exclusion criteria were included under the study. INCLUSION CRITERIA Age >40yrs with symptoms of severe acute respiratory Illness (screened as per the symptom suggestive of acute respiratory illness, mohfw.gov.in) Asymptomatic aged >40yrs with comorbidities and in direct contact with confirmed cases of covid19. EXCLUSION CRITERIA Immunocompromised patients. Pregnant patients. Autoimmune disease patients History of psychiatric illness The patients were isolated in different wards based on the presence or absence and severity of symptoms. Detailed history, general and systemic examination and investigations were done. Samples of throat and nasal swab were sent for RT-PCR assay of covid19 testing done by Real time reverse transcriptase based PCR. Regular monitoring of patients was done. Treatment given based on the most recent guidelines update by the ICMR and made available by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Data was analysed by using SPSS 22.0 (trial version) software and T test, Chi-square Pierson's correlation and other appropriate statistical test will be used to analyse the data. Aims Objectives: To understand the symptomatology, disease course and complications of covid19. To study the changes in laboratory parameters in association with severity of illness. To study the effect of presence of comorbidities with respect to the outcome of covid19 Ethical Considerations: Since it being a retrospective observational study, complete patient confidentiality was being maintained while collecting and analysing the data as well as during the tabulation of the results.","Gupta, Deepak; Sharma, Ramavtar; Patwardhan, Bhalachandra; Mathur, Rajendra Dutt",The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34585882/,570

Other groups or viruses are not classically associated with infection of the gut but can infect the gastrointestinal tract in immunocompromised individuals (herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus, papillomavirus ....). The viruses associated with gastroenteritis represent a large number of taxonomic group. Because these viruses have in general been difficult to cultivate, most members of this group were firstly detected by electron microscopic examination (adenovirus, astrovirus, calicivirus, coronavirus, rotavirus ....). The most widely used diagnostic techniques for adenovirus (40/41), rotavirus and astrovirus detection in faecal samples include immunoassays such as Elisa and latex agglutination. Nucleic acid hybridization techniques have generally not proven to be substantially sensitive and the more sensitive techniques recently developed use the polymerase chain reaction (adenovirus) or the reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction (astrovirus, calicivirus, coronavirus, rotavirus). Special efforts have been made in the search for efficient procedures to extract viral nucleic acids, and to establish the optimal conditions for the amplification and identification of PCR products but the candidate viruses were very different, consensus procedures were not determined, and amplification kits were not actually commercialized.","Denis, F; Barrière, E; Venot, C; Ranger-Rogez, S; Durepaire, N; Martin, C; Ploy, M C",Annales de biologie clinique,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9309226/,570

The adverse effects of cigarette smoking on the lungs and cardiovascular system are well described; however, the detrimental effects of smoking on the liver are not as well defined. Smoking affects the liver via 3 separate mechanisms: toxic (both direct and indirect), immunologic, and oncogenic. There is an emerging body of evidence of an association between cigarette smoking and progression of fibrosis in chronic liver diseases such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and primary biliary cholangitis. Smoking is associated with accelerated development of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with chronic hepatitis B or C virus infection. Tobacco smoking adversely affects lung function, which increases physical limitations and may preclude liver transplantation. Following liver transplantation, smoking is associated with several adverse outcomes, including increased risk of de novo malignancy, vascular complications, and nongraft-associated mortality. The respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus disease 2019 serves as a good example of the complex interplay between the lungs and the liver. It is evident that cigarette smoking has important negative effects on a multitude of liver diseases and that patients' smoking cessation must be prioritized. The data are limited, and more research is needed to better understand how smoking affects the liver. This article summarizes what is known about the pathologic effects of cigarette smoking on common liver diseases.","Rutledge, Stephanie M; Asgharpour, Amon",Gastroenterology & hepatology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34035697/,570

The response (or output) of interest is the control reproduction number, which is an epidemiological threshold governing the persistence or elimination of SARS in a given population. The compartmental model includes parameters associated with control measures such as quarantine and isolation of asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals. One feature of our analysis is the incorporation of time-dependent functions into the model to reflect the progressive refinement of these SARS control measures over time. Consequently, the model contains continuous time-varying inputs and outputs. In this setting, sensitivity and uncertainty analytical techniques are used in order to analyze the impact of the uncertainty in the parameter estimates on the results obtained and to determine which parameters have the largest impact on driving the disease dynamics.","McLeod, Robert G; Brewster, John F; Gumel, Abba B; Slonowsky, Dean A",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20210378/,570

Surgical residents were redeployed to COVID-19 units whereas education and scientific didactics were reduced. The aim of this study is to identify the impact of COVID-19 on Flemish surgical residents' education, personal life and volume of performed surgeries. METHODS A cross-sectional retrospective survey on educational and personal impact during the first COVID-19 wave was administered anonymously to all surgical residents in Flanders. A quantitative comparison of performed surgeries during this period and the same period a year earlier was conducted. RESULTS 193 surgical residents (46%) completed the survey. 63% of residents were no longer admitted to multidisciplinary oncologic meetings and 107 (55%) residents had no longer any scientific theoretical meetings at all. Almost one in two residents (46%) indicated more than 50% reduction in time in the operating theater and one in three (31%) residents were involved in care for COVID-19 positive surgical patients. 78% of the residents experienced a negative impact on their surgical training and 41% experienced a negative influence on their private situation. Performed surgical cases during the COVID-19 period were on average 40% less for second, third- and fourth-year residents. CONCLUSION Surgical residents perceived a high negative impact on personal and professional lives during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in Flanders. Education and training programs were cancelled and volume of performed surgeries decreased tremendously.

Method One hundred and fifty extracted mandibular first premolars were collected from Nepalese population. Access cavities were prepared on the occlusal surface of each tooth. Teeth were decalcified by immerging in 5% nitric acid, dehydrated in ethyl alcohol and made transparent using methyl salicylate. Methylene blue dye was injected through access cavity and canal anatomy were observed and classified according to Vertucci's classification. Result The average length of mandibular first premolar was 20.43mm. One rooted teeth were 96% and two rooted were 4%. Vertucci's type I canal configuration was most prevalent (72%) followed by type V (18.6%), type III (3.3%), type II (2.6%) and type IV (2.6%). An unusual configuration was found in one tooth. Isthmus and apical deltas were found in 8.6%) and 14.6% of the cases respectively. Conclusion Type I canal configuration were the most frequently observed root canal configuration in mandibular first premolar followed by type V configuration. Such variation in root canal anatomy should be taken into consideration to ensure successful endodontic therapy of these teeth.","Shrestha, R; Srii, R; Shrestha, D",Kathmandu University medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33305752/,570

Recently, the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) protein ICP0 has been shown to block the induction of ISGs by subverting the IFN pathway upstream of the 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)/RNase L pathway. We report that ICP0 also prevents rRNA degradation at late stages of HSV-1 infection, independent of its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, and that the resultant rRNA degradation is independent of the classical RNase L antiviral pathway. Moreover, the degradation is independent of the viral RNase vhs and is independent of IFN response factor 3. These studies indicate the existence of another, previously unidentified, RNase that is part of the host antiviral response to viral infection.","Sobol, Paul T; Mossman, Karen L",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16352546/,570

SEMs typically represent counts of individuals in discrete infection states using Markov jump processes (MJPs), but are computationally challenging as imperfect surveillance, lack of subject-level information, and temporal coarseness of the data obscure the true epidemic. Analytic integration over the latent epidemic process is impossible, and integration via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is cumbersome due to the dimensionality and discreteness of the latent state space. Simulation-based computational approaches can address the intractability of the MJP likelihood, but are numerically fragile and prohibitively expensive for complex models. A linear noise approximation (LNA) that approximates the MJP transition density with a Gaussian density has been explored for analyzing prevalence data in large-population settings, but requires modification for analyzing incidence counts without assuming that the data are normally distributed. We demonstrate how to reparameterize SEMs to appropriately analyze incidence data, and fold the LNA into a data augmentation MCMC framework that outperforms deterministic methods, statistically, and simulation-based methods, computationally. Our framework is computationally robust when the model dynamics are complex and applies to a broad class of SEMs. We evaluate our method in simulations that reflect Ebola, influenza, and SARS-CoV-2 dynamics, and apply our method to national surveillance counts from the 2013--2015 West Africa Ebola outbreak.","Fintzi, Jonathan; Wakefield, Jon; Minin, Vladimir N",ArXiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33948449/,570

METHODS A self-administered questionnaire survey of 14,554 HCWs in nine healthcare settings, which included tertiary care hospitals, community hospitals, and polyclinics, was carried out in May-July 2003. Only doctors, nurses, and clerical staff were selected for subsequent analysis. RESULTS A total of 10 236 valid questionnaires were returned (70.3% response); 873 doctors, 4404 nurses, and 921 clerical staff were studied. A total of 32.5% of doctors, 48.7% of nurses, and 77.1% of the administrative staff agreed that paper and/or surgical masks were ""useful in protecting from contracting SARS"". Among this group, 23.6% of doctors and 42.3% of nurses reported working with SARS patients. The view that a paper and/or surgical mask was adequate protection against SARS was held by 33.3% of doctors and 55.9% of nurses working at the A&E unit, 30.5% of doctors and 49.4% of nurses from medical wards, and 27.5% of doctors and 37.1% of nurses from intensive care units.

Knowledge of infants' electroencephalogram (EEG) responses to anaesthetics is fragmentary. An earlier pilot study suggested amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG) may be a useful measure of anaesthetic effect. The aim of this study was to determine how aEEG changes between awake and anaesthetised children of varying ages and to compare the response to that seen with Spectral Edge Frequency 90% (SEF90). A prospective observational study of children receiving a general anaesthetic was conducted. Anaesthetic regimen remained at the discretion of the treating anaesthetist. EEG data were collected using the BrainZ ReBrim(TM) monitor using forehead and biparietal montages. SEF90 and aEEG were compared across age groups, EEG montage and between awake and anaesthetised states. A total of 178 children (aged 24 days to 14 years) were recruited. All aEEGs were greater during anaesthesia compared to when awake and this difference varied with age. Only children older than two years showed lower SEF90 while anaesthetised compared to when awake. SEF90 from children younger than six months was higher during anaesthesia compared to when awake. Analysis of parietal and forehead EEG montages revealed age-related differences. These findings suggest that SEF90 and aEEG can discriminate between awake and anaesthetised states in older children. In younger children aEEG changes are less pronounced and SEF90 either cannot discriminate between states or responds paradoxically. The aEEG may be marginally better than other EEG parameters in measuring anaesthetic depth in children.","McKeever, S; Johnston, L; Davidson, A J",Anaesthesia and intensive care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22417022/,570

In this study, the crystal structures of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) M(pro) and a severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) M(pro) mutant (H41A), in complex with an N-terminal autocleavage substrate, were individually determined to elucidate the structural flexibility and substrate binding of M(pro). A monomeric form of IBV M(pro) was identified for the first time in CoV M(pro) structures. A comparison of these two structures to other available M(pro) structures provides new insights for the design of substrate-based inhibitors targeting CoV M(pro)s. Furthermore, a Michael acceptor inhibitor (named N3) was cocrystallized with IBV M(pro) and was found to demonstrate in vitro inactivation of IBV M(pro) and potent antiviral activity against IBV in chicken embryos.

Serum samples were collected between 1999 and 2004 and were tested for antibodies using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. Seroprevalence was very high for IBV (84%); intermediate for reovirus (41%), APV (40%), and ILTV (20%); and very low for ALV (<5%) antibodies. By commercial ELISA, the seroprevalence of antibodies against AIV was, in some flocks, up to 63%. However, more specific assays did not confirm AIV antibodies, indicating that all flocks tested were free of avian influenza antibodies. Birds seemed to be first infected by IBV (at about 7 wk of age), then by reovirus at 12 wk, before they became infected by APV (week 25) and ILTV (week 30). This is the first report of serological evidence of the above viruses in West Africa. Further studies are necessary to assess economic losses due to these avian viruses and the costs and benefits of countermeasures.","Owoade, A A; Ducatez, M F; Muller, C P",Avian diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16863071/,570

195530,Hui: a partnership in practice in familial hypercholesterolemia.,2020-09-25,"INTRODUCTION The preparedness levels of front-line clinicians including physicians, nurses, emergency medical responders (EMRs), and other medical staff working in clinics, offices and ambulatory care centers must be assessed, so these personnel are able to deal with communicable and potentially lethal diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). In order to determine the knowledge of these clinicians, a survey of their understanding of SARS and their use of educational resources was administered. METHODS A questionnaire was distributed to physicians, nurses, and EMRs attending conferences on SARS in the summer of 2003. Questions related to information sources, knowledge of SARS, and plans implemented in their workplace to deal with it. Statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (10.1 Program, SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois). RESULTS A total of 201 community healthcare providers (HCPs) participated in the study. A total of 51% of the participants correctly identified the incubation period of SARS; 48% correctly identified the symptoms of SARS; and 60% knew the recommended infection control precautions to take for families. There was little difference in knowledge among the physicians, nurses, and EMRs evaluated. Media outlets such as newspapers, journals, television, and radio were reported as the main sources of information on SARS. However, there appears to be a growing use of the Internet, which correlated best with the correct answers on symptoms of SARS. Fewer than one-third of respondents were aware of a protocol for SARS in their workplace. A total of 60% reported that N-95 masks were available in their workplace. CONCLUSION These findings suggest the need for more effective means of education and training for front-line clinicians, as well as the institution of policies and procedures in medical offices, clinics, and emergency services in the community.","Tice, Alan Douglas; Kishimoto, Mitsumasa; Dinh, Chuong Hoang; Lam, Geoffrey Tak-Kin; Marineau, Michelle",Prehospital and disaster medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16892883/,570
196059,Productivity losses associated with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder in New Zealand.,2016,"While viral infections and their impact are well studied in domestic cats, only limited information is available on their occurrence in free-ranging lions. The goals of the present study were (i) to investigate the prevalence of antibodies to feline calicivirus (FCV), herpesvirus (FHV), coronavirus (FCoV), parvovirus (FPV), and immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and of feline leukemia virus (FeLV) antigen in 311 serum samples collected between 1984 and 1991 from lions inhabiting Tanzania's national parks and (ii) to evaluate the possible biological importance and the interrelationship of these viral infections. Antibodies to FCV, never reported previously in free-ranging lions, were detected in 70% of the sera. In addition, a much higher prevalence of antibodies to FCoV (57%) was found than was previously reported in Etosha National Park and Kruger National Park. Titers ranged from 25 to 400. FeLV antigen was not detectable in any of the serum samples. FCoV, FCV, FHV, and FIV were endemic in the Serengeti, while a transient elevation of FPV titers pointed to an outbreak of FPV infection between 1985 and 1987. Antibody titers to FPV and FCV were highly prevalent in the Serengeti (FPV, 75%; FCV, 67%) but not in Ngorongoro Crater (FPV, 27%; FCV, 2%). These differences could be explained by the different habitats and biological histories of the two populations and by the well-documented absence of immigration of lions from the Serengeti plains into Ngorongoro Crater after 1965. These observations indicate that, although the pathological potential of these viral infections seemed not to be very high in free-ranging lions, relocation of seropositive animals by humans to seronegative lion populations must be considered very carefully.","Hofmann-Lehmann, R; Fehr, D; Grob, M; Elgizoli, M; Packer, C; Martenson, J S; O'Brien, S J; Lutz, H",Clinical and diagnostic laboratory immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8877134/,570

Treatment requires long-term immunosuppression, and steroid-sparing treatment strategies are desirable. Azathioprine and cyclosporine A have limitations, however alternatives have not been described in adults. CASE REPORT We present the case of a 54-year-old male patient with autoimmune enteropathy who responded initially to a standard treatment with steroids, but was dependent on 30 mg prednisolone. Medical treatment was changed to tacrolimus after renal function deteriorated under treatment with cyclosporine A. Under this regimen, small bowel histology normalized and the clinical condition is stable after 2 years of introduction of tacrolimus. CONCLUSION This constitutes the first report of effective treatment of adult autoimmune enteropathy with tacrolimus, a substance with a similar mode of action to cyclosporine, but with fewer side effects and improved bioavailability.","Daum, Severin; Sahin, Ergün; Jansen, Andreas; Heine, Bernhard; Riecken, Ernst-Otto; Zeitz, Martin; Schmidt, Wolfgang",Digestion,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14581765/,570

We demonstrated that these species are noncovalently associated tetramers and trimers of gp41 which represent the native form of this protein in virions. These complexes were stable when boiled in the presence of low concentrations of sodium dodecyl sulfate but were dissociated to gp41 monomers at high sodium dodecyl sulfate concentrations. Moreover, two human monoclonal antibodies preferentially recognized the oligomeric complexes over monomeric gp41 in Western blots, indicating the presence of epitopes recognized by the human immune system on the gp41 multimers which are not efficiently expressed by the dissociated monomers. The demonstration of the existence of multimeric env complexes and the enhanced and altered antigenicity of such multimers may be relevant to the design of subunit and recombinant human immunodeficiency virus env vaccines.","Pinter, A; Honnen, W J; Tilley, S A; Bona, C; Zaghouani, H; Gorny, M K; Zolla-Pazner, S",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2786089/,570

Toward the development of a safe, effective, and inexpensive vaccine candidate, we have expressed the N-terminal fragment of SARS-CoV S protein (S1) in tomato and low-nicotine tobacco plants. Incorporation of the S1 fragment into plant genomes as well as its transcription was confirmed by PCR and RT-PCR analyses. High levels of expression of recombinant S1 protein were observed in several transgenic lines by Western blot analysis using specific antibodies. Plant-derived antigen was evaluated to induce the systemic and mucosal immune responses in mice. Mice showed significantly increased levels of SARS-CoV-specific IgA after oral ingestion of tomato fruits expressing S1 protein.

The data serve as a reference for a study of resuscitation efficacy at HUT such as during transport. Nine healthy swine (49+/-4 kg) were anesthetized and multiple sensors including myocardial pressure-volume loops catheter, carotid flow probe, blood pressure catheters, near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) tissue oximetry and mixed venous oximetry (SVO2) catheter were introduced and parameters continuously recorded. Experimental protocol consisted of baseline in supine position (15 min), 30 degrees HUT (15 min), recovery at supine position (15 min) and 60 degrees HUT (5 min). Vacuum mattress was used for body fixation during tilts. We found that 30 and 60 degrees inclination led to significant immediate reduction in hemodynamic and oximetry parameters. Mean arterial pressure (mm Hg) decreased from 98 at baseline to 53 and 39, respectively. Carotid blood flow dropped to 47 % and 22 % of baseline values, end diastolic volume to 49 % and 53 % and stroke volume to 47 % and 45 % of baseline. SVO2 and tissue oximetry decreased by 17 and 21 percentage points. The values are means.

We describe the symptoms and signs of the first 2,184 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted at COVID-19 treatment centers in Lagos State. We also assessed the relationship between patients' presenting symptoms, sociodemographic and clinical characteristics and COVID-19 deaths. METHODS: Medical records of PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients were extracted and analyzed for their symptoms, symptom severity, presence of comorbidities and outcome. RESULTS: The ages of the patients ranged from 4 days to 98 years with a mean of 43.0(16.0) years. Of the patients who presented with symptoms, cough (19.3%) was the most common presenting symptom. This was followed by fever (13.7%) and difficulty in breathing, (10.9%). The most significant clinical predictor of death was the severity of symptoms and signs at presentation. Difficulty in breathing was the most significant symptom predictor of COVID-19 death (OR:19.26 95% CI 10.95-33.88). The case fatality rate was 4.3%. CONCLUSION: Primary care physicians and COVID-19 frontline workers should maintain a high index of suspicion and prioritize the care of patients presenting with these symptoms. Community members should be educated on such predictors and ensure that patients with these symptoms seek care early to reduce the risk of deaths associated with COVID-19.","Abayomi, Akin; Odukoya, Oluwakemi; Osibogun, Akin; Wright, Ololade; Adebayo, Bisola; Balogun, Mobolanle; Abdus-Salam, Ismael; Bowale, Abimbola; Mutiu, Bamidele; Saka, Babatunde; Adejumo, Moyosore; Yenyi, Sam; Agbolagorite, Rotimi; Onasanya, Oluwatosin; Erinosho, Eniola; Obasanya, Joshua; Adejumo, Olu; Adesola, Sunday; Oshodi, Yewande; Akase, Iorhen E; Ogunbiyi, Shina; Lajide, Dayo; Erinoso, Femi; Abdur-Razzaq, Hussein",Int J Infect Dis,,570

205152,The Satisfaction Level of Undergraduate Science Students towards Using E-learning and Virtual Classes in Exceptional Condition Covid-19 Crisis,2021,"The state of Kuwait is facing a substantial challenge in responding to the spread of the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). The government's decision to repatriate stranded citizens back to Kuwait from various COVID-19 epicenters has generated a great concern. It has heightened the need for prediction models to estimate the epidemic size. Mathematical modeling plays a pivotal role in predicting the spread of infectious diseases to enable policymakers to implement various health and safety measures to contain the spread. This research presents a forecast of the COVID-19 epidemic size in Kuwait based on the confirmed data. Deterministic and stochastic modeling approaches were used to estimate the size of COVID-19 spread in Kuwait and determine its ending phase. In addition, various simulation scenarios were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of nonpharmaceutical intervention measures, particularly with time-varying infection rates and individual contact numbers. Results indicate that, with data until 19 April 2020 and before the repatriation plan, the estimated reproduction number in Kuwait is 2.2. It also confirms the efficiency of the containment measures of the state of Kuwait to control the spread even after the repatriation plan. The results show that a high contact rate among the population implies that the epidemic peak value is yet to be reached and that more strict intervention measures must be incorporated.","Almeshal, Abdullah M.; Almazrouee, Abdulla I.; Alenizi, Mohammad R.; Alhajeri, Saleh N.",Appl.

The study used a mixed methods design study as a research methodology. Methods: A semi-structured interview and the scale for Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) were used to achieve the aim of the study. The survey was conducted from 16 to 20 April 2020 and 1 to 2 September 2020 in Poland, at the during of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in this country. The data were coded and cross-processed. The (COREQ) checklist was followed. Results: Interviews with patients and a thorough analysis of recordings revealed commonly used phrases in the following categories: “anxiety”, “Am I going crazy?”, “Sleep problems”. 10 out of 11 respondents reported sleep disorders of varying severity according to the Insomnia Severity Index scale. Patients presented a fear related to the return to society and normal functioning after quarantine. Additionally, some study participants voiced concerns related to their mental health;some cases of hallucinations were reported. Conclusions: Further global population studies should be conducted to analyse this phenomenon. Acute Stress Disorder should be understood as a threat to life and health of an isolated society in quarantine. Further research in this area should be promoted and the need for global guidelines for the entire population should be developed.","Krupa, S.; Paweł, W.; Mędrzycka-Dąbrowska, W.; Lintowska, A.; Ozga, D.",Global Advances In Health and Medicine,,570

Public markets were exempted from the restrictive regulations instituted to limit the rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). In the early stage of the pandemic, we assessed people's knowledge, attitudes, and behavior on public markets towards COVID-19. Methods. We conducted a cross-sectional study from 16 to 29 April 2020 among sellers and customers frequenting the food sections of ten public markets in three large cities (Kolwezi, Likasi, and Lubumbashi) and one small town (Lwambo) of the former Katanga province. We administered a questionnaire on knowledge (about clinical characteristics, transmission and prevention) and on attitudes in relation to COVID-19. We also observed prevailing practices (hand-washing and mask-wearing). Results: Of the 347 included participants (83% women, 83% sellers), most had low socioeconomic status and a low level of education. Only 30% of participants had correct knowledge of COVID-19. The majority of the respondents (88%) showed no confidence in the government's ability to manage the upcoming pandemic crisis. Nearly all respondents (98%) were concerned about the associated increase in food insecurity. Preventive practices were rarely in place. Conclusion: For an effective implementation of measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in Africa, appropriate health education programs to improve knowledge and attitudes are warranted among the population frequenting public markets.","Carsi Kuhangana, Trésor; Kamanda Mbayo, Caleb; Pyana Kitenge, Joseph; Kazadi Ngoy, Arlène; Muta Musambo, Taty; Musa Obadia, Paul; Katoto, Patrick D M C; Banza Lubaba Nkulu, Célestin; Nemery, Benoit",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,570

The clinical spectrum is broad, with recent reports of cases with cardiac involvement, mainly myocarditis, in COVID-19 patients. To date there are few reports of COVID-19 cases in need of heart surgery. The position of the Spanish Society of Cardiovascular and Endovascular Surgery (SECCE) has been to ensure the correct care of emerging and urgent patients, according to current clinical guidelines, however, in some cases the distinction between involvement of cardiac or pulmonary etiology can make the decision-making difficult. We present the case of a man with infective endocarditis and intercurrent infection with COVID-19, in which multidisciplinary consensus was essential to set the surgical indication, because his symptomatology generated controversy with current clinical guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) on infective endocarditis. We consider that the adaptation of the guidelines during the current health emergency and the multidisciplinary decision-making can facilitate therapeutic action in complex cases of cardiac pathologies with surgical indication and COVID-19 coinfection.","Barajas-Díaz, Carolina; Centeno-Rodríguez, Jorge; Pérez-de la Sota, Enrique; Eixerés-Esteve, Andrea; López-Gude, María-Jesús; Cortina-Romero, José M.",Cir.

To understand the significance of the vitamin D endocrine system in SARS-CoV-2 pathobiology, computational approaches were applied to transcriptomic datasets from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cells of such patients or healthy individuals. Levels of vitamin D receptor, retinoid X receptor, and CYP27A1 in BALF cells of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 were found to be reduced. Additionally, 107 differentially expressed, predominantly downregulated genes, as potentially modulated by vitamin D endocrine system, were identified in transcriptomic datasets from patient's cells. Further analysis of differentially expressed genes provided eight novel genes with a conserved motif with vitamin D-responsive elements, implying the role of both direct and indirect mechanisms of gene expression by the dysregulated vitamin D endocrine system in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Protein-protein interaction network of differentially expressed vitamin D-modulated genes were enriched in the immune system, NF-&#954;B/cytokine signaling, and cell cycle regulation as top predicted pathways that might be affected in the cells of such patients. In brief, the results presented here povide computational evidence to implicate a dysregulated vitamin D endocrine system in the pathobiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","George, Bijesh; Amjesh, Revikumar; Paul, Aswathy Mary; Santhoshkumar, T R; Pillai, Madhavan Radhakrishna; Kumar, Rakesh",Sci Rep,,570

The current COVID 19 pandemic impact on health services mandated an utmost readiness to implement telemedicine which in part is dependent on health care providers willingness to adopt such platforms. AIM: The aim of this cross sectional study was to assess knowledge and attitude toward telemedicine Egyptian dermatologists amidst the COVID 19 pandemic. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross sectional study was designed and data were collected using structured self-administered online questionnaires. RESULTS: Dermatologists had a good knowledge about telemedicine (mean 4.17 ± 1.63; p < .05). Of those completing the questionnaire, 193 (68.9%) were familiar with the term 'telemedicine' and 164 (58.6%) were familiar with tools like teleconferencing. The majority of responding dermatologists 227 (81.1%) were confident that the COVID 19 pandemic is a good opportunity to start applying telemedicine protocols however the majority 234 (83.6%) preferred using it on trial basis at first before full implementation. CONCLUSION: In conclusion an overall good attitude toward telemedicine was reported with a mean of 3.39 (p < .05).

For the first time at great scale, Chinese college students had their educational activities moved online in spring 2020. Due to this unexpected isolation and unconventional learning method, their mental health following returning to school is worth investigating. METHODS: Between June 1 and June 15, 2020, a total of 8,921 returning college students' mental health status were assessed using instruments designed for psychiatric disorders, namely the 9-Item Patient Heath Questionnaire (PHQ-9), 7-Item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), 6-Item Impact of Event Scale (IES-6), Youth Self Rating Insomnia Scale (YSIS), and self-developed questionnaire. RESULTS: Our results showed that 8.7%, 4.2%, 10.5%, and 6.1% of the participants experienced depression, anxiety, acute stress, and insomnia, respectively, with a total of 19.8% reporting having at least one psychiatric symptom following their return to school. Sophomore and Senior year, and presence of previous psychiatric conditions contribute to the increased occurrence of psychiatric issues. The level of impact by COVID-19 on one's daily functioning is also positively associated with poor mental health. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested no significant increase in the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms, following the first batch of students' return to school. These findings aim to complement the current understanding of the psychiatric impact of COVID-19 on students and assist school principals to plan their return-to-school approaches in a mental-health sensitive way.","Wang, Dongfang; Chen, Huilin; Zhai, Shuyi; Zhu, Zhiyi; Huang, Shuiqing; Zhou, Xiuzhu; Pan, Ye; Meng, Dongjing; Yang, Zheng; Zhao, Jingbo; Fan, Fang; Liu, Xianchen",J Affect Disord,,570

The shortage of intensive care units (ICU) beds and ventilators for the treatment of patients with severe respiratory failure produced angst in the clinicians/intensivists who have to decide which patients admit to ICU and in which patients to implement palliative care. They have to apply specific clinical and ethical criteria, in emergency conditions. Proportionality and appropriateness criteria should be integrated with equity, equality, utility criteria, widening the distributive justice concept from the right of the patient to receive all available therapies to a right resources allocation during shortage, guided by public health ethic. The clinical criteria should include the disease severity, the number and severity of comorbidities, frailty, the organ failures and their stage, the patient's age, the functional autonomy and cognitive status. Consequently the first come-first served rule to ICU admission should not be applied. The patients not admitted to ICU due to clinical reasons and advanced stage diseases should receive a high quality palliative care, to obtain a good symptoms control (mainly dyspnea, anxiety and delirium) and to implement palliative sedation at the end of life.

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study in a large tertiary maternity unit within a university hospital with an average annual birth of over 10,000 births. We prospectively collected and analysed data for a cohort of 23 pregnant patients including singleton and multiple pregnancies tested positive for COVID-19 between February 2020 and April 2020 inclusive to assess the effect of COVID-19 on pregnancy, and neonatal outcomes. RESULTS: Twenty-three pregnant patients tested positive for COVID-19, delivering 20 babies including a set of twins, with four ongoing pregnancies at the time of manuscript submission. 16/23 (70 %) whom tested positive were patients from Asian (Indian sub-continent) background. The severity of the symptoms ranged from mild in 13/23 (65.2 %) of the patients, moderate in 2/23 (8.7 %), and severe in 8/23 (34.8 %). Four out of total 23 COVID-19 pregnant patients (17.4 %) developed severe adult respiratory distress syndrome complications requiring ICU support, one of whom led to maternal death 1/23 (4.3 %). 11/23 (48 %) of the patients had pre-existing co-morbidities, with morbid obesity 5/23 (21.7 %) and diabetes 4/23 (17.4 %) being the more commonly represented. Of the 23 pregnant patients 19 were in their third trimester of pregnancy and delivered; 7/19 (36.8 %) had preterm birth, 3/19 (15.8 %) developed adult respiratory distress syndrome before delivery, and 2/19 (10.5 %) had pre-eclampsia. 16/19 (84 %) of patients delivered by C-section. Out of the 20 new-borns, 18 were singletons with a set of twin. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is associated with high prevalence of preterm birth, preeclampsia, and caesarean section compared to non-COVID pregnancies.

226040,The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Batik Industry: An Empirical Study in Indonesia,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic is bringing about far-reaching structural changes on both the economy and public health, and conventional methodologies have to be fine-tuned to assist public health decision making. In this context, behavioural economics, which is situated at the crossroads between economics and social psychology, is an undeniably innovative field. In contrast with conventional models, the economic models of behavioural economics incorporate psychological and social determinants to produce more accurate predictions of individual behaviour. In the last 20 years, the scientific community has been using this approach's quantitative tool, experimental economics, in many areas of health, including prevention, promotion, human resources and social signage. Studies have come up with effective solutions that have improved best public health practices and provided sources of inspiration that should not be overlooked in the fight against COVID-19. They have allowed natural human behaviour to take a central role again, helped us to understand how the social and economic environment influences individuals, and enabled us to anticipate human reactions and so make faster adjustments to public policies.","Arnaud, Yann; Borgès Da Silva, Roxane; Drouin, Olivier",Can J Public Health,,570

This study examined 2908 calls made to a national mental health helpline over a 10 month period, 2 months prior to (Pre-COVID) and 8 months during the pandemic phase, that incorporated the imposition of a partial lockdown, followed by the removal and reintroduction of restrictive measures locally. Data collected included reason/s for call assistance, gender, age and number of daily diagnosed cases and deaths due to COVID-19. In the Pre-COVID phase, calls for assistance were related to information needs and depression. With the imposition of a partial lockdown, coupled with the first local deaths and spikes in number of diagnosed cases, a significant increase in number of calls targeting mental health, medication management and physical and financial issues were identified. Following the removal of local restrictions, the number of calls decreased significantly; however, with the subsequent reintroduction of restrictions, coupled with the rise in cases and deaths, assistance requested significantly targeted informational needs. Hence, whilst calls in the initial phase of the pandemic mainly targeted mental health issues, over time this shifted towards information seeking requests, even within a context where the number of deaths and cases had significantly risen.","Scerri, Josianne; Sammut, Alexei; Cilia Vincenti, Sarah; Grech, Paulann; Galea, Michael; Scerri, Christian; Calleja Bitar, Daniela; Dimech Sant, Stephania",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,570

The current study was designed to evaluate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection based on both nucleic acid testing (NAT) and antibody testing in Chinese patients receiving MHD. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: From December 1, 2019, to March 31, 2020, a total of 1,027 MHD patients in 5 large hemodialysis centers in Wuhan, China, were enrolled. Patients were screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection by symptoms and initial computed tomography (CT) of the chest. If patients developed symptoms after the initial screening was negative, repeat CT was performed. Patients suspected of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 were tested with 2 consecutive throat swabs for viral RNA. In mid-March 2020, antibody testing for SARS-CoV-2 was obtained for all MHD patients. EXPOSURE: NAT and antibody testing results for SARS-CoV-2. OUTCOMES: Morbidity, clinical features, and laboratory and radiologic findings. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Differences between groups were examined using t test or Mann-Whitney U test, comparing those not infected with those infected and comparing those with infection detected using NAT with those with infection detected by positive serology test results. RESULTS: Among 1,027 patients receiving MHD, 99 were identified as having SARS-CoV-2 infection, for a prevalence of 9.6%. Among the 99 cases, 52 (53%) were initially diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection by positive NAT; 47 (47%) were identified later by positive immunoglobulin G (IgG) or IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. There was a spectrum of antibody profiles in these 47 patients: IgM antibodies in 5 (11%), IgG antibodies in 35 (74%), and both IgM and IgG antibodies in 7 (15%). Of the 99 cases, 51% were asymptomatic during the epidemic; 61% had ground-glass or patchy opacities on CT of the chest compared with 11.6% among uninfected patients (P<0.001). Patients with hypertensive kidney disease were more often found to have SARS-CoV-2 infection and were more likely to be symptomatic than patients with another primary cause of kidney failure. LIMITATIONS: Possible false-positive and false-negative results for both NAT and antibody testing; possible lack of generalizability to other dialysis populations. CONCLUSIONS: Half the SARS-CoV-2 infections in patients receiving MHD were subclinical and were not identified by universal CT of the chest and selective NAT. Serologic testing may help evaluate the overall prevalence and understand the diversity of clinical courses among patients receiving MHD who are infected with SARS-CoV-2.","Tang, Hui; Tian, Jian-Bo; Dong, Jun-Wu; Tang, Xiao-Tie; Yan, Zhen-Yuan; Zhao, Yuan-Yuan; Xiong, Fei; Sun, Xin; Song, Cai-Xia; Xiang, Chang-Gang; Tu, Can; Lei, Chun-Tao; Liu, Jing; Su, Hua; Huang, Jing; Qiu, Yang; Miao, Xiao-Ping; Zhang, Chun",Am J Kidney Dis,,570

235405,A descriptive analysis of the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on driving behavior and road safety,2020,"Magnetic resonance (MR) studies suggested cardiac involvement post-Covid-19 in a significant subset of affected individuals, including athletes. This brings serious clinical concerns regarding the potential need for in-depth cardiac screening in athletes after Covid-19 before return to play. The aim of this study was to gain further insight into the relation between Covid-19 and cardiac involvement in professional athletes. This was a retrospective cohort study, in which 26 consecutive elite athletes (national team, Olympians, top national league players; median age 24 years, interquartile range [IQR] 21-27, 81% female) were included. At 1.5 T including balanced steady-state free precession cine imaging, T1 and T2-mapping using Myomaps software (Siemens), dark-blood T2-weighted images with fat suppression, and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) with phase-sensitive inversion recovery sequence were used. The athletes had mainly asymptomatic or mild course of the disease (77%). They were scanned after a median of 32 days (IQR 22-62 days) from the diagnosis. MR data were reviewed by three independent observers, each with >10 years cardiac MR experience. Native T1, T2, extracellular volume, and T2 signal intensity ratio were calculated. Diagnosis of acute myocarditis was based on modified Lake Louise criteria. Statistical analyses used were Pearson correlation and Bland-Altman repeatability analysis. At the time of MR the athletes had no pathologic electrocardiogram abnormalities or elevated troponin levels. MR did not reveal any case of acute myocarditis. Cardiac abnormalities were found in five (19%) athletes, including four athletes presenting borderline signs of isolated myocardial edema and one athlete showing nonischemic LGE with pleural and pericardial effusion. Another athlete had signs of persistent lung congestion without cardiac involvement. We have shown that in a small group of elite athletes with mainly asymptomatic to mild Covid-19, lack of electrocardiographic changes, and normal troponin concentration 1-2 months after the diagnosis, there were no signs of acute myocarditis, but 19% of athletes had some abnormalities as assessed by cardiac MR.

237674,"Choose your shortcuts wisely: COVID-19 rapid reviews of traditional, complementary and integrative medicine",2020,"Sociological research has traditionally emphasized the importance of post-birth factors (i.e., social, economic, and cultural capital) in the intergenerational transmission of educational advantages, to the neglect of potentially consequential pre-birth endowments (e.g., heritable traits) that are passed from parent to child. In this study, we leverage an experiment of nurture-children who were adopted at birth into nonrelative families-in an effort to simultaneously model the effects associated with both pathways. To do so, we fit a series of simple linear regression models that relate the academic achievement of adopted children to the educational attainments of their adoptive and biological parents, using U.S. data from a recent nationwide sample of birth and adoptive families (the Early Growth and Development Study). Because our dataset includes both ""genetic"" and ""environmental"" relatives, but not ""genetic-and-environmental"" relatives, the separate contributions of each pathway can be identified, as well as possible interactions between the two. Our results show that children's early achievements are influenced not only by the attainments of their adoptive parents, but also the attainments of their birth parents-suggesting the presence of environmental and genetically mediated effects. Supplementary analyses provide little evidence of effect moderation, using both distal and proximate measures of the childhood environment to model gene-by-environment interactions. These findings are robust to a variety of parameterizations, withstand a series of auxiliary checks, and remain intact even after controlling for intrauterine exposures and other measurable variables that could compromise our design. The implications of our results for theory and research in the stratification literature, and for those interested in educational mobility, are discussed.","Halpern-Manners, Andrew; Marahrens, Helge; Neiderhiser, Jenae M; Natsuaki, Misaki N; Shaw, Daniel S; Reiss, David; Leve, Leslie D",,,570

The objective was to evaluate association between standardized simple visual lung damage CT score (vldCTs) at admission, which does not require any software, and 30-day mortality. METHODS: In a single-center prospective cohort of COVID-19 patients included during 4 weeks, the presence and extent of ground glass opacities(GGO), consolidation opacities, or both of them were visually assessed in each of the 5 lung lobes (score from 0 to 4 per lobe depending on the percentage and out of 20 per patient = vldCTs) after the first chest CT performed to detect COVID-19 pneumonia. RESULTS: Among 210 confirmed COVID-19 patients, the number of survivors and non-survivors was 162 (77%) and 48 (23%), respectively at 30 days. vldCTs was significantly higher in non-survivors, and the AUC of vldCTs to distinguish survivors and non-survivors was 0.72 (95%CI 0.628-0.807, p < 0.001); the best cut-off vldCTs value was 7. During follow-up, significant differences in discharges and 30-day mortality were observed between patients with vldCTs &#8805; 7 versus vldCTs < 7: (98 [85.2%] vs 49 [51.6%]; p < 0.001 and 36 [37.9%] vs 12 [12.4%]; p < 0.001, respectively.

CONCLUSIONS: By using chest CT in COVID-19 patients, extensive lung damage can be visually assessed with a score related to 30-day mortality independent of conventional risk factors of the disease. KEY POINTS: â¢ In non-selected COVID-19 patients included prospectively during 4 weeks, the extent of ground glass opacities(GGO) and consolidation opacities evaluated by a simple visual score was related to 30-day mortality independent of age, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation levels, comorbidities, and hs-troponin I level at admission. â¢ This severity score should be incorporated into risk stratification algorithms and in structured chest CT reports requiring a standardized reading by radiologists in case of COVID-19.","Charpentier, Etienne; Soulat, Gilles; Fayol, Antoine; Hernigou, Anne; Livrozet, Marine; Grand, Teodor; Reverdito, Guillaume; Al Haddad, Jad; Dang Tran, Kim Diep; Charpentier, Anne; Clement, Olivier; Hulot, Jean-Sebastien; Mousseaux, Elie",Eur. radiol,,570
245589,"Epidemiological emergency, correct exercise of parental responsibility and protection of bigenitoriality",2020,"Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) is a global pandemic. The Covid-19 outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has overloaded healthcare systems that need medication to be rapidly established, at least to minimize the incidence of Covid-19. The co-infection with other microorganisms has drastically affected human health. Due to the utmost necessity to treat the patient infected with Covid-19 earliest, poor diagnosis and misuse of antibiotics may lead the world where no more drugs are available even to treat mild infections. Besides, sanitizers and disinfectants used to help minimize widespread coronavirus infection risk also contribute to an increased risk of antimicrobial resistance. To ease the situation, zinc supplements' potentiality has been explored and found to be an effective element to boost the immune system. Zinc also prevents the entry of the virus by increasing the ciliary beat frequency. Furthermore, the limitations of current antiviral agents such as a narrow range and low bioavailability can be resolved using nanomaterials, which are considered an important therapeutic alternative for the next generation. Thus, the development of new antiviral nanoagents will significantly help tackle many potential challenges and knowledge gaps.

We reviewed the effects of the pandemic on the neurosurgical case volume to study the incidence of COVID-19 in patients undergoing these procedures during the perioperative period and compared the characteristics and outcomes of this group to those of patients without COVID-19. METHODS: The neurosurgical and neurointerventional procedures at 2 tertiary care centers during the pandemic were reviewed. The case volume, type, and acuity were compared to those during the same period in 2019. The perioperative COVID-19 tests and results were evaluated to obtain the incidence. The baseline characteristics, including a modified Medically Necessary Time Sensitive (mMeNTS) score, and outcome measures were compared between those with and without COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 405 cases were reviewed, and a significant decrease was found in total spine, cervical spine, lumbar spine, and functional/pain cases. No significant differences were found in the number of cranial or neurointerventional cases. Of the 334 patients tested, 18 (5.4%) had tested positive for COVID-19. Five of these patients were diagnosed postoperatively. The mMeNTS score, complications, and case acuity were significantly different between the patients with and without COVID-19. CONCLUSION: A small, but real, risk exists of perioperative COVID-19 in neurosurgical patients, and those patients have tended to have a greater complication rate. Use of the mMeNTS score might play a role in decision making for scheduling elective cases. Further studies are warranted to develop risk stratification and validate the incidence.","Dowlati, Ehsan; Zhou, Tianzan; Sarpong, Kwadwo; Pivazyan, Gnel; Briscoe, Jessica; Fayed, Islam; Mualem, William; Black, Jordan; Kalhorn, Christopher G; Nair, Mani N; Felbaum, Daniel R",World Neurosurg,,570

By revisiting transcriptomic data from patients with Th2 low versus Th2 high asthma, as well as mild, moderate, and severe asthmatics, we characterized the changes in expression of human coronavirus and influenza viral entry genes relative to sex, airway location, and disease endotype. We found sexual dimorphism in the expression of SARS-CoV-2-related genes ACE2, TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4, and SLC6A19. ACE2 receptor downregulation occurred specifically in females in Th2 high asthma, while proteases broadly assisting coronavirus and influenza viral entry, TMPRSS2, and TMPRSS4, were highly upregulated in both sexes. Overall, changes in SARS-CoV-2-related gene expression were specific to the Th2 high molecular endotype of asthma and different by asthma severity and airway location. The downregulation of ACE2 (COVID-19, SARS) and ANPEP (HCoV-229E) viral receptors wascorrelated with loss of club and ciliated cells in Th2 high asthma.

252425,An insight on wabāi amrād (Epidemic diseases) and covid-19 like conditions – unani perspective,2020,"ABSTRACT Many health workers in the Americas, especially women, have been victims of discrimination and different types of grievances during the COVID-19 pandemic. These brief reflections aim to make the problem visible, offer theoretical explanations and some recommendations. The pandemic constitutes a massive crisis that triggers fears and reassuring of diffuse anxieties, which often includes someone to blame. Healthcare workers have become circumstantial scapegoating targets. The inflicted attacks can be understood as reactive hate crimes since they are originated from an allegedly healthy person to an allegedly contaminated person. People seems to incur in a sanitary profiling process based on the health worker's uniform. However, these expressions of hatred are fueled by pre-pandemic circumstances such as the precariousness of health systems and deficient medical equipment, misogyny, or the pervasiveness of authoritarian tendencies. Understanding this situation as a human rights issue, it is suggested to consider measures in order to discourage these attacks, such as: guaranteeing the appropriate conditions of hospitals and the personal protective equipment of workers; development of recognition campaigns of the healthcare staff and the work they carry out (in particular female nurses); and implementing transitory regulations that sanction any hate crime type attack to health workers or the scientific community. Furthermore, educational advocacy efforts should reiterate basic hygiene measures for the people, but also focus on refuting false and pseudoscientific beliefs that contribute to the fear-induced construction of the health worker as a threat of contagion.(AU)","Orellana, Carlos I",Rev. salud pública,,570

We are herein discussing a possible novel therapeutic tool for COVID-19. METHODS: Virus binds to the cell surface receptor ACE2; indeed, recent evidences suggested that SARS-CoV-2 may be using as co-receptor, when entering the cells, the same one used by MERS-Co-V, namely the DPP4/CD26 receptor. The aforementioned observation underlined that mechanism of cell entry is supposedly similar among different coronavirus, that the co-expression of ACE2 and DPP4/CD26 could identify those cells targeted by different human coronaviruses and that clinical complications may be similar. RESULTS: The DPP4 family/system was implicated in various physiological processes and diseases of the immune system, and DPP4/CD26 is variously expressed on epithelia and endothelia of the systemic vasculature, lung, kidney, small intestine and heart. In particular, DPP4 distribution in the human respiratory tract may facilitate the entrance of the virus into the airway tract itself and could contribute to the development of cytokine storm and immunopathology in causing fatal COVID-19 pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: The use of DPP4 inhibitors, such as gliptins, in patients with COVID-19 with, or even without, type 2 diabetes, may offer a simple way to reduce the virus entry and replication into the airways and to hamper the sustained cytokine storm and inflammation within the lung in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection.","Solerte, Sebastiano Bruno; Di Sabatino, Antonio; Galli, Massimo; Fiorina, Paolo",Acta Diabetol,,570

256391,Higher education in troubled times: on the impact of Covid-19 in Italy,2020,"This study's case narrative presents the Australian digital marketing firm (DUK). DUK successfully transitioned across the 2020 Australian business economic downturn created during the COVID-19 global pandemic. DUK's competencies, capabilities and competitiveness form its 3Cs Market Intelligence Framework. When these 3Cs are expanded, and then networked with Porter's Five Forces model, along with the firm's decisive pivot with knowledge inclusions, the DUK strategic change matrix can be used to portray a firm's matrix-box of its current multi-dimensional business components. The strategic change matrix approach offers a firm a visual map that can be matrix-boxed and quickly interpreted. When faced with adversity, a firm can remap its matrix-box into an expanded form that includes its proposed enhanced competitiveness business solutions. These solutions can then be operationalised to form potentially sustainable business pathways into the future. This approach is particularly useful when a firm is confronted with a perceived economic, or game-changing business crisis, or when a firm makes the strategic decision to pivot, and to seek a new sustainable business-enhancing pathway, or when a firm just wants to visualise its ongoing business pathways into the future.","Hamilton, John",Sustainability,,570

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate Galectin-1 (Gal-1), Galectin-3 (Gal-3), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels in patients with COVID-19. Gal-1, Gal-3, and PGE2 serum concentrations were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent analysis (ELISA) on 84 COVID-19 patients (severe=29 and nonsevere=55) and 56 healthy controls. In this study, the increased levels of Gal-1 (median, 9.86, 6.35, 3.67 ng/ml), Gal-3 (median, 415.31, 326.33, 243.13 pg/ml)and PGE2 (median, 193.17, 192.58, 124.62 pg/ml) levels were found in patients with COVID-19 than healthy controls (p<0.001 for all). In the severe group, Gal-3 levels were higher while there were no differences in Gal-1 and PGE2 levels (p=0.011, p=0.263, p=0.921, respectively). There was a positive correlation between serum Gal-1 and Gal-3 levels (&#961;=0.871, p<0.001).

Everybody is waiting the findings of ongoing clinical trials in various chemical and biological products. This review is specifically aimed to summarize the available evidence and ongoing clinical trials of remdesivir as a potential therapeutic option for COVID-19. Remdesivir is an investigational drug having broad spectrum antiviral activity with its target RNA dependent RNA polymerase. It has not yet been officially approved for Ebola and Coronaviruses. Several studies showed that remdesivir had promising in vitro and in vivo antiviral activities against SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV strains. On the top of this, it exhibited a promising in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 strains though there are no published studies that substantiate its activity in vivo until the time of this review. There are few phase 3 randomized double-blind placebo controlled trials on the way to investigate the safety and efficacy of remdesivir. Of which, one completed double blind, placebo controlled trial showed that remdesivir showed faster time to clinical improvement in severe COVID-19 patients compared to placebo though not found statistically significant.

The main route of transmission is considered to be the inhalation of large respiratory drops, by deposition in the mucosa and hands or contaminated fomites. The objective is to identify the interventions to be performed during hospitalization for the correct and safe handling of clothing and hygiene of patients and health professionals. METHOD: Scoping review carried out without chronological or language delimitation in the PUBMED and Cochrane databases. Tracking standards and recommendations of national and international government entities to answer the research question on the safe handling of clothing and skin hygiene in patients and in health professionals to avoid Covid-19 infection. The data analysis was carried out in 2stages: in the first, identification and categorization of the studies, and in the second, content analysis as an informative and classifying criterion. RESULTS: 14 documents have been selected, mainly from government entities. The recommendations are structured in 5 sections on the management of clothing and skin hygiene of infected patients and health professionals in the hospital setting. CONCLUSION: The clothing of patients and healthcare personnel are transmitting vehicles of the disease. Its correct treatment helps to improve the control of the same and the correct use of the resources available at the moment. Proper skin hygiene, especially hand cleansing, is one of the basic pillars for infection prevention and control. We highlight the similarity of some of the guidelines collected and provided by the different agencies consulted.","Martín-Vaquero, Yolanda; González-Sanz, Azucena; Muñoz-Martín, Beatriz",Enferm. clin.

Although the respiratory tract is the primary portal of entry of SARS-CoV-2, gastrointestinal involvement associated with nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea may also occur. No drug or vaccine has been approved due to the absence of evidence deriving from rigorous clinical trials. Increasing interest has been highlighted on the possible preventative role and adjunct treatment of lactoferrin, glycoprotein of human secretions part of a non-specific defensive system, known to play a crucial role against microbial and viral infections and exerting anti-inflammatory effects on different mucosal surfaces and able to regulate iron metabolism. In this review, analysing lactoferrin properties, we propose designing a clinical trial to evaluate and verify its effect using a dual combination treatment with local, solubilized intranasal spray formulation and oral administration. Lactoferrin could counteract the coronavirus infection and inflammation, acting either as natural barrier of both respiratory and intestinal mucosa or reverting the iron disorders related to the viral colonization.","Campione, Elena; Cosio, Terenzio; Rosa, Luigi; Lanna, Caterina; Di Girolamo, Stefano; Gaziano, Roberta; Valenti, Piera; Bianchi, Luca",,,570
278251,Rethinking Teacher Education Policy in ICT: Lessons from Emergency Remote Teaching (ERT) the during COVID-19 Pandemic Period in Korea,2021,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Presence of comorbidities in patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have often been associated with increased in-hospital complications and mortality. Intriguingly, several developed countries with a higher quality of life have relatively higher mortality with COVID-19, compared to the middle- or low-income countries. Moreover, certain ethnic groups have shown a higher predilection to contract COVID-19, with heightened mortality. We sought to review the available literature with regards to impact of COVID-19 and comorbidities on the health and economics, especially in context to the developing countries including India. METHODS: A Boolean search was carried out in PubMed, MedRxiv and Google Scholar databases up till August 23, 2020 using the specific keywords, to find the prevalence of comorbidities and its outcome in patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: All available evidence consistently suggests that presence of comorbidities is associated with a poor outcome in patients with COVID-19. Diabetes prevalence is highest in Indian COVID-19 patients, compared to other countries. Majority of the patients with COVID-19 are asymptomatic ranging from 26 to 76%. CONCLUSIONS: Universal masking is the need of hour during unlock period. Low-income countries such as India, Brazil and Africa with less resources and an average socio-economic background, must adopt a strict policy for an affordable testing programs to trace, test, identify and home quarantine of asymptomatic cases. Despite the huge number of COVID-19 patients, India still has low volume research at the moment.","Singh, Awadhesh Kumar; Misra, Anoop",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,570

280137,(Job)Keeping up appearances,2021,"Background: Multiple serosurveillance studies have focused on the presence of antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in the general population and confirmed cases. However, seroprevalence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) among contacts of confirmed cases can add further value to the scientific findings. Objectives: The objective is to estimate COVID-19 seropositivity among contacts of COVID-19 cases and to compare the seropositivity between types of contact for the assessment of differential risk and transmission dynamics. Methods: Large scale population-based serosurveillance on contacts of COVID-19 cases was carried out during the second half of August 2020 in Ahmedabad using the COVID-Kavach. The seropositivity among contacts was estimated and correlated-compared with type of contact and other demographic factors. Results: With 1268 positive for IgG antibodies from 3973 samples, the seropositivity against COVID-19 among contacts of cases in Ahmedabad was 31.92% (95% confidence interval 30.48%-33.38%). The seropositivity among family contacts was significantly higher (39.36%) as compared to other contacts (28.72%) (Z = 6.60, P < 0.01). This trend is seen across all age groups and both the sex groups. The seropositivity has increasing trend with increasing age and is significantly higher among females (35.11%) than males (28.95%) (Z = 4.16, P < 0.01). Conclusion: Seropositivity of 31.92% among contacts indicates that a large proportion of contacts have already acquired immunity on account of their contact with the case. Higher seropositivity among family contacts justifies the risk categorization and testing strategy adopted for the contacts of the cases. This also reaffirms the need for contact tracing strategy for controlling the inevitable spread of pandemic.","Prakash, Om; Solanki, Bhavin; Sheth, Jay Kirtikumar; Kadam, Mina; Vyas, Sheetal",Indian J Public Health,,570

METHODS: Twenty-six patients with XLH (age 3.1-25.7 years) were enrolled in Pediatric Endocrine Unit; nine of them were receiving human monoclonal anti-fibroblast growth factor 23 antibody (burosumab) and 17 (pediatric patients, age 9.5-17.9 years, n=7; young-adult patients, age 20.1-25.7 years, n=10) received conventional treatment with inorganic oral phosphate salts and active vitamin D metabolites. A Covid-19 free pathway was addressed for XLH patients receiving burosumab treatment in hospital. XLH patients receiving conventional treatment were followed by phone calls, e-mails, or telemedicine. RESULTS: All XLH patients receiving burosumab continued the scheduled follow-up and treatment; none of them was infected by Covid-19. Seven XLH patients out of 17 (41%) receiving conventional treatment showed some complication related to the disease itself or its treatment: periapical abscess with gingival fistula was diagnosed in five patients (three children and two young-adults) and treated with antibiotics with complete resolution; one child showed abdominal pain due to the administration of high doses of inorganic oral phosphate salts solved by reducing the dosage, and one child had severe legs pain during deambulation after orthopedic surgery solved with common analgesics. CONCLUSIONS: Covid-19 free pathway was safe and effective to manage XLH patients receiving burosumab. E-health technologies were useful methods to follow XLH patients receiving conventional treatment during Covid-19 pandemic lockdown.","Baroncelli, Giampiero I; Bertelloni, Silvano; Cosci O Di Coscio, Mirna; Tyutyusheva, Nina; D039,; Elios, Sofia; Peroni, Diego",,,570

How have prior experiences with managing HIV prepared countries for COVID-19? To what extent has the structure of the global health field enabled or constrained countries' ability to respond? Drawing on qualitative methods, this article examines the impact of HIV interventions on the healthcare system in Malawi and its implications for addressing COVID-19. I argue that the historical and continued influence of neoliberalism in global health manifests in the structures and routines of clinical practice. In Malawi's health centres, a parallel NGO system of care has become grafted onto state healthcare, with NGOs managing HIV commodities and providing care to HIV patients. While HIV NGOs do support the work of government providers, it is limited to tasks that align with their programmatic goals. Outside of donor priorities, the conditions of public healthcare are left behind, and government providers struggle with shortages of staff, medical resources, and basic infrastructure. In the context of COVID-19, risks are compounded as public healthcare facilities not only struggle with resources to treat patients, but also become a site of risk itself for COVID-19 infection.","Zhou, Amy",Glob Public Health,,570

The COVID-19 pandemic has forced the governments of hundreds of countries to apply several heavy restrictions in the citizens' socio-economic life. Italy was one of the most affected countries with long-term restrictions, impacting the socio-economic tissue. During this lockdown period, people got informed mostly on Online Social Media, where a heated debate followed all main ongoing events. In this scenario, the following study presents an in-depth analysis of the main emergent topics discussed during the lockdown phase within the Italian Twitter community. The analysis has been conducted through a general purpose methodological framework, grounded on a biological metaphor and on a chain of NLP and graph analysis techniques, in charge of detecting and tracking emerging topics in Online Social Media, e.g. streams of Twitter data. A term-frequency analysis in subsequent time slots is pipelined with nutrition and energy metrics for computing hot terms by also exploiting the tweets quality information, such as the social influence of the users. Finally, a co-occurrence analysis is adopted for building a topic graph where emerging topics are suitably selected. We demonstrate via a careful parameter setting the effectiveness of the topic tracking system, tailored to the current Twitter standard API restrictions, in capturing the main sociopolitical events that occurred during this dramatic phase.","De Santis, Enrico; Martino, Alessio; Rizzi, Antonello",IEEE Access,,570

These properties allow them to be used as an element of biosensors for the detection of specific proteins, including viral ones, which makes it possible to design valuable diagnostic tools. The influenza virus causes a huge number of human and animal deaths worldwide every year, and contributes to remarkable economic losses. In addition, in 2020, a new threat appeared-the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic. Both disease entities, especially in the initial stage of infection, are almost identical in terms of signs and symptoms. Therefore, a diagnostic solution is needed that will allow distinguishing between both pathogens, with high sensitivity and specificity; it should be cheap, quick and possible to use in the field, for example, in a doctor's office. All the mentioned properties are met by aptasensors in which the detection elements are specific aptamers. We present here the latest developments in the construction of various types of aptasensors for the detection of influenza virus. Aptasensor operation is based on the measurement of changes in electric impedance, fluorescence or electric signal (impedimetric, fluorescence and electrochemical aptasensors, respectively); it allows both qualitative and quantitative determinations.

DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. SETTING: A newly created specialized rehabilitation unit in a tertiary care medical center. PARTICIPANTS: Consecutive sample of patients (N=100) with COVID-19 infection admitted to rehabilitation. INTERVENTION: Inpatient rehabilitation for postacute care COVID-19 patients. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Measurements at admission and discharge comprised a Barthel Activities of Daily Living Index (including baseline value before COVID-19 infection), time to perform 10 sit-to-stands with associated cardiorespiratory changes, and grip strength (dynamometry). Correlations between these outcomes and the time spent in the intensive care unit (ICU) were explored. RESULTS: Upon admission to rehabilitation, 66% of the patients were men, the age was 66±22 years, mean delay from symptom onset was 20.4±10.0 days, body mass index was 26.0±5.4 kg/m2, 49% had hypertension, 29% had diabetes, and 26% had more than 50% pulmonary damage on computed tomographic scans. The mean length of rehabilitation stay was 9.8±5.6 days. From admission to discharge, the Barthel index increased from 77.3±26.7 to 88.8±24.5 (P<.001), without recovering baseline values (94.5±16.2; P<.001). There was a 37% improvement in sit-to-stand frequency (0.27±0.16 to 0.37±0.16 Hz; P<.001), a 13% decrease in post-test respiratory rate (30.7±12.6 to 26.6±6.1; P=.03), and a 15% increase in grip strength (18.1±9.2 to 20.9±8.9 kg; P<.001).

Generating SSI rates often requires labor-intensive methods, but increasing numbers of publications reported SSI rates using administrative data. METHODS: Index laminectomy and spinal fusion procedures were identified using Canadian Classification of Health Interventions (CCI) procedure codes for inpatients and outpatients in the province of Alberta, Canada between 2008 and 2015. SSIs occurring in the year postsurgery were identified using the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Canada (ICD-10-CA) diagnosis and CCI procedure codes indicative of post-op infection. Rates of SSIs and case characteristics were reported. RESULTS: Over the 8-year study period, 21,222 index spinal procedures were identified of which 12,027 (56.7%) were laminectomy procedures, with 322 SSIs identified, an SSI rate of 2.7 per 100 procedures. Of the 9,195 (43.3%) fusion procedures, 298 were identified as an SSI, an SSI rate of 3.2 per 100 procedures. This study found SSI rates increased from 2008 and 2015, and rates were the highest in the 0-18 year age group. CONCLUSIONS: The rates reported in this study were similar to published SSI rates using traditional surveillance methods, suggesting administrative data may be a viable method for reporting SSI rates following spinal procedures. Further work is needed to validate SSIs identified using administrative data by comparing to traditional surveillance.","Crocker, Alysha; Kornilo, Anna; Conly, John; Henderson, Elizabeth; Rennert-May, Elissa; Leal, Jenine",Am J Infect Control,,570

However, it is also crucial for clinicians to summarize and investigate the co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 in children.We retrospectively reviewed the clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, and imaging characteristics of COVID-19 patients in co-infection group (CI, nâ=â27) and single infection group (SI, nâ=â54). Samples were tested for multiple pathogens.A high incidence (27/81, 33%) of co-infection in children with COVID-19 was revealed. The most frequent co-infected pathogen was mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP, 20/81, 25%), followed by virus (6/81, 7%), and bacteria (4/81, 5%). No significant difference in clinical characteristics, laboratory examinations, or hospital stay was observed between the patients with co-infections and those with monomicrobial, only lower in white blood cell counts (CI: 5.54â±â0.36 vs SI: 7.38â±â0.37, Pâ=â.002), neutrophil counts (CI: 2.20â±â0.20 vs SI: 2.92â±â0.23, Pâ=â.024) and lymphocyte counts (CI: 2.72â±â0.024 vs SI: 3.87â±â0.28, Pâ=â.006). Compared with the patients with monomicrobial, chest imaging of those with co-infections showed consolidation in more cases (CI: 29.6% vs SI: 11.1%, Pâ=â.038) and duration of positive in nucleic acid was shorter (CI: 6.69â±â0.82 vs SI: 9.69â±â0.74, Pâ=â.015).Co-infection was relatively common in children with COVID-19, almost 1/3 had co-infection, most commonly caused by MP. Co-infection did not cause a significant exacerbation in clinical manifestations.","Li, Ying; Wang, Haizhou; Wang, Fan; Lu, Xiaoxia; Du, Hui; Xu, Jiali; Han, Feng; Zhang, Liqiong; Zhang, Maorong",Medicine (Baltimore),,570

301757,Revealing higher education students’ readiness for abrupt online learning in Indonesia amidst COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis, which are typically transmitted via respiratory droplets, are leading causes of invasive diseases, including bacteraemic pneumonia and meningitis, and of secondary infections subsequent to post-viral respiratory disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of invasive disease due to these pathogens during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: In this prospective analysis of surveillance data, laboratories in 26 countries and territories across six continents submitted data on cases of invasive disease due to S pneumoniae, H influenzae, and N meningitidis from Jan 1, 2018, to May, 31, 2020, as part of the Invasive Respiratory Infection Surveillance (IRIS) Initiative. Numbers of weekly cases in 2020 were compared with corresponding data for 2018 and 2019. Data for invasive disease due to Streptococcus agalactiae, a non-respiratory pathogen, were collected from nine laboratories for comparison. The stringency of COVID-19 containment measures was quantified using the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker. Changes in population movements were assessed using Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports. Interrupted time-series modelling quantified changes in the incidence of invasive disease due to S pneumoniae, H influenzae, and N meningitidis in 2020 relative to when containment measures were imposed. FINDINGS: 27 laboratories from 26 countries and territories submitted data to the IRIS Initiative for S pneumoniae (62â837 total cases), 24 laboratories from 24 countries submitted data for H influenzae (7796 total cases), and 21 laboratories from 21 countries submitted data for N meningitidis (5877 total cases). All countries and territories had experienced a significant and sustained reduction in invasive diseases due to S pneumoniae, H influenzae, and N meningitidis in early 2020 (Jan 1 to May 31, 2020), coinciding with the introduction of COVID-19 containment measures in each country. By contrast, no significant changes in the incidence of invasive S agalactiae infections were observed. Similar trends were observed across most countries and territories despite differing stringency in COVID-19 control policies. The incidence of reported S pneumoniae infections decreased by 68% at 4 weeks (incidence rate ratio 0·32 [95% CI 0·27-0·37]) and 82% at 8 weeks (0·18 [0·14-0·23]) following the week in which significant changes in population movements were recorded. INTERPRETATION: The introduction of COVID-19 containment policies and public information campaigns likely reduced transmission of S pneumoniae, H influenzae, and N meningitidis, leading to a significant reduction in life-threatening invasive diseases in many countries worldwide.

There are no guidelines at present regarding the use of immunosuppressants. The main aim at this time should be to keep the dermatoses under control without exposing the patient to increased risk of infection and the consequent morbidity. In vitiligo, immunosuppressive agents are utilized in stabilization of progressive disease. An informed decision regarding the use of immunosuppressive agents can be made only after understanding the immune response to coronavirus, reviewing the mechanism of action of drug and evidence from previous studies on risk of infection. This review briefly discusses the mechanism of action and the safety data of various immunosuppressants used in vitiligo.","Mehta, Hitaishi Soufila K.

There is an urgent need to look for alternative strategies for COVID-19 treatment especially in the case of severe and/or critically ill patients with cytokine release syndrome (CRS). AIM: Convalescent plasma proved to increase survival rates in other severe viral infections. Therefore, convalescent plasma could be a promising treatment option for severe COVID-19 patients. METHOD: In our article, we present the first two critically ill Hungarian patients with COVID-19 infection treated with convalescent fresh frozen plasma. RESULTS: At the time of plasma therapy both patients were on mechanical ventilation and received antiviral agents and a full scale of supportive care. Each patient received 3 × 200 mL of convalescent plasma of recently recovered donors with sufficient novel anti-coronavirus IgG titers. Subsequent to convalescent plasma infusion, oxygenization improved and inflammatory markers decreased in both individuals. As compared to pretransfusion, lymphocyte counts increased and interleukin-6 level lessened. Both patients were weaned from mechanical ventilation within 2 weeks of treatment. No severe adverse effects were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our experience indicates that convalescent plasma therapy is well tolerated and could potentially improve clinical outcomes. Optimal dose and timing as well as precise assessment of clinical benefit of convalescent plasma therapy will need further investigation in larger, well-controlled trials. This is the first report of the successful use of convalescent plasma in the treatment of critically ill patients with COVID-19 infection in Hungary.

Whether acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) is safe and effective in aneurysm clipping remains largely unknown. METHODS: Patients with aSAH who underwent clipping surgery within 72 hours from bleeding were included. The patients in the ANH group received 400 mL autologous blood collection, and the blood was returned as needed during surgery. The relationships between ANH and perioperative allogeneic blood transfusion, postoperative outcome, and complications were analyzed. RESULTS: Sixty-two patients with aSAH were included between December 2019 and June 2020 (20 in the ANH group and 42 in the non-ANH group). ANH did not reduce the need of perioperative blood transfusion (3 [15%] vs. 5 [11.9%]; P = 0.734). However, ANH significantly increased serum hemoglobin levels on postoperative day 1 (11.5 ± 2.5 g/dL vs. 10.3 ± 2.0 g/dL; P = 0.045) and day 3 (12.1 ± 2.0 g/dL vs. 10.7 ± 1.3 g/dL; P = 0.002). Multivariable analysis indicated that serum hemoglobin level on postoperative day 1 (odds ratio, 0.895; 95% confidence interval, 0.822-0.973; P = 0.010) was an independent risk factor for unfavorable outcome, and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that it had a comparable predictive power to World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies grade (Z = 0.275; P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: ANH significantly increased postoperative hemoglobin levels, and it may hold the potential to improve patients' outcomes. Routine use of ANH should be considered in aneurysm clipping surgery.","Chen, Ping; Wang, Ying; Zhang, Xin-Huang; Kang, De-Zhi; Lin, Xian-Zhong; Lin, Qing-Song",World neurosurgery (Online),,570

320666,Turning home boredom during the outbreak of COVID-19 into thriving at home and career self-management: the role of online leisure crafting,2020,"Pandemic coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) gives ample reason to generally review coronavirus (CoV) containment. For establishing some preliminary views on decontamination and disinfection, surrogate CoVs have commonly been assessed. This review serves to examine the existing science in regard to CoV containment generically and then to translate these findings into timely applications for COVID-19. There is widespread dissemination of CoVs in the immediate patient environment, and CoVs can potentially be spread via respiratory secretions, urine, and stool. Interpretations of the spread however must consider whether studies examine for viral RNA, virus viability by culture, or both. Presymptomatic, asymptomatic, and post-14 day virus excretion from patients may complicate the epidemiology. Whereas droplet spread is accepted, there continues to be controversy over the extent of possible airborne spread and especially now for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). CoVs are stable in body secretions and sewage at reduced temperatures. In addition to temperature, dryness or relative humidity, initial viral burden, concomitant presence of bioburden, and the type of surface can all affect stability. Generalizing, CoVs can be susceptible to radiation, temperature extremes, pH extremes, peroxides, halogens, aldehydes, many solvents, and several alcohols. Whereas detergent surfactants can have some direct activity, these agents are better used as complements to a complex disinfectant solution. Disinfectants with multiple agents and adverse pH are more likely to be best active at higher water temperatures. Real-life assessments should be encouraged with working dilutions. The use of decontamination and disinfection should be balanced with considerations of patient and caregiver safety. Processes should also be balanced with considerations for other potential pathogens that must be targeted. Given some CoV differences and given that surrogate testing provides experimental correlates at best, direct assessments with SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2 are required.","Cimolai, Nevio",J. med. virol,,570

Hence, COVID-19 vaccines that can elicit a robust T cell response may be particularly important. The design, development and experimental evaluation of such vaccines is aided by an understanding of the landscape of T cell epitopes of SARS-CoV-2, which is largely unknown. Due to the challenges of identifying epitopes experimentally, many studies have proposed the use of in silico methods. Here, we present a review of the in silico methods that have been used for the prediction of SARS-CoV-2 T cell epitopes. These methods employ a diverse set of technical approaches, often rooted in machine learning. A performance comparison is provided based on the ability to identify a specific set of immunogenic epitopes that have been determined experimentally to be targeted by T cells in convalescent COVID-19 patients, shedding light on the relative performance merits of the different approaches adopted by the in silico studies.

To enable students of a local secondary school in Brisbane, Queensland, to continue with their practical agricultural science learning and facilitate online learning, a ""Grass Gazers"" citizen science scoping project was designed and rapidly implemented as a collaboration between the school and a multidisciplinary university research group focused on pollen allergy. Here, we reflect on the process of developing and implementing this project from the perspective of the school and the university. A learning package including modules on pollen identification, tracking grass species, measuring field greenness, using a citizen science data entry platform, forensic palynology, as well as video guides, risk assessment and feedback forms were generated. Junior agriculture science students participated in the learning via online lessons and independent data collection in their own local neighborhood and/or school grounds situated within urban environments. The university research group and school coordinator, operating in their own distributed work environments, had to develop, source, adopt, and/or adapt material rapidly to meet the unique requirements of the project. The experience allowed two-way knowledge exchange between the secondary and tertiary education sectors. Participating students were introduced to real-world research and were able to engage in outdoor learning during a time when online, indoor, desk-based learning dominated their studies. The unique context of restrictions imposed by the social isolation policies, as well as government Public Health and Department of Education directives, allowed the team to respond by adapting teaching and research activity to develop and trial learning modules and citizen science tools. The project provided a focus to motivate and connect teachers, academic staff, and school students during a difficult circumstance. Extension of this citizen project for the purposes of research and secondary school learning has the potential to offer ongoing benefits for grassland ecology data acquisition and student exposure to real-world science.","Van Haeften, Shanice; Milic, Andelija; Addison-Smith, Beth; Butcher, Christopher; Davies, Janet Mary",,,570

We investigate private psychiatrists' uptake of telehealth, and face-to-face consultations for April-September 2020 for the state of Victoria, which experienced two consecutive waves of COVID-19. We compare these to the same 6 months in 2019. METHOD: MBS-item-consultation data were extracted for video, telephone and face-to-face consultations with a psychiatrist for April-September 2020 and compared to face-to-face consultations in the same period of 2019 Victoria-wide, and for all of Australia. RESULTS: Total Victorian psychiatry consultations (telehealth and face-to-face) rose by 19% in April-September 2020 compared to 2019, with telehealth comprising 73% of this total. Victoria's increase in total psychiatry consultations was 5% higher than the all-Australian increase. Face-to-face consultations in April-September 2020 were only 46% of the comparative 2019 consultations.

333912,Variation in volumes and characteristics of trauma patients admitted to a level one trauma centre during national level 4 lockdown for COVID-19 in New Zealand,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Respiratory failure, multiple organ failure, shortness of breath, recovery, and mortality have been identified as critically important core outcomes by more than 9300 patients, health professionals, and the public from 111 countries in the global coronavirus disease 2019 core outcome set initiative. The aim of this project was to establish the core outcome measures for these domains for trials in coronavirus disease 2019. DESIGN: Three online consensus workshops were convened to establish outcome measures for the four core domains of respiratory failure, multiple organ failure, shortness of breath, and recovery. SETTING: International. PATIENTS: About 130 participants (patients, public, and health professionals) from 17 countries attended the three workshops. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Respiratory failure, assessed by the need for respiratory support based on the World Health Organization Clinical Progression Scale, was considered pragmatic, objective, and with broad applicability to various clinical scenarios. The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment was recommended for multiple organ failure, because it was routinely used in trials and clinical care, well validated, and feasible. The Modified Medical Research Council measure for shortness of breath, with minor adaptations (recall period of 24 hr to capture daily fluctuations and inclusion of activities to ensure relevance and to capture the extreme severity of shortness of breath in people with coronavirus disease 2019), was regarded as fit for purpose for this indication. The recovery measure was developed de novo and defined as the absence of symptoms, resumption of usual daily activities, and return to the previous state of health prior to the illness, using a 5-point Likert scale, and was endorsed. CONCLUSIONS: The coronavirus disease 2019 core outcome set recommended core outcome measures have content validity and are considered the most feasible and acceptable among existing measures. Implementation of the core outcome measures in trials in coronavirus disease 2019 will ensure consistency and relevance of the evidence to inform decision-making and care of patients with coronavirus disease 2019.","Tong, Allison; Baumgart, Amanda; Evangelidis, Nicole; Viecelli, Andrea K; Carter, Simon A; Azevedo, Luciano Cesar; Cooper, Tess; Bersten, Andrew; Cervantes, Lilia; Chew, Derek P; Crowe, Sally; Douglas, Ivor S; Flemyng, Ella; Elliott, Julian H; Hannan, Elyssa; Horby, Peter; Howell, Martin; Ju, Angela; Lee, Jaehee; Lorca, Eduardo; Lynch, Deena; Manera, Karine E; Marshall, John C; Gonzalez, Andrea Matus; McKenzie, Anne; Mehta, Sangeeta; Mer, Mervyn; Morris, Andrew Conway; Needham, Dale M; Nseir, Saad; Povoa, Pedro; Reid, Mark; Sakr, Yasser; Shen, Ning; Smyth, Alan R; Simpson, A John; Snelling, Tom; Strippoli, Giovanni F M; Teixeira-Pinto, Armando; Torres, Antoni; Turner, Tari; Webb, Steve; Williamson, Paula R; Woc-Colburn, Laila; Zhang, Junhua; Craig, Jonathan C",Crit. care med,,570
334034,A comparison of machine learning methods to predict hospital readmission of diabetic patient,2021,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an enveloped virus which binds its cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and enters hosts cells through the action of its spike (S) glycoprotein displayed on the surface of the virion. Compared to the reference strain of SARS-CoV-2, the majority of currently circulating isolates possess an S protein variant characterized by an aspartic acid-to-glycine substitution at amino acid position 614 (D614G). Residue 614 lies outside the receptor binding domain (RBD) and the mutation does not alter the affinity of monomeric S protein for ACE2. However, S(G614), compared to S(D614), mediates more efficient ACE2-mediated transduction of cells by S-pseudotyped vectors and more efficient infection of cells and animals by live SARS-CoV-2. This review summarizes and synthesizes the epidemiological and functional observations of the D614G spike mutation, with focus on the biochemical and cell-biological impact of this mutation and its consequences for S protein function. We further discuss the significance of these recent findings in the context of the current global pandemic.","Jackson, Cody B; Zhang, Lizhou; Farzan, Michael; Choe, Hyeryun",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,,570

After the SARS epidemic, Taiwan began to overhaul its Communicable Disease Control Act authorising the government to act in a murky situation without the fear of violating due process. In hindsight, the new law has contributed a large part to the effective containment of Covid-19 in Taiwan. However, a new issue emerged concerning the conflict between an individual's freedom of confidential communication and the government's use of cell phone positioning to monitor self-quarantine.

This article explores stakeholders’ perceptions of educational technology as it relates to schooling in six rural districts in the state of Idaho. Stakeholder descriptions were collected using sondeo style focus groups with seven specific groups (students, parents, teachers, support staff, community members, principals, boards, and superintendents) in each district (n = 42). Stakeholders believe the educational technology in their schooling environments is both necessary and welcome in their districts; however, their assessments indicated that despite a decades-long policy push aimed at increasing educational equity, augmenting schooling facilities with technology presents complex resourcing challenges. The conclusion explores how different experiences and conceptualizations of context shape individuals’ understanding and implementation of educational technology. We argue that a more contextualized view of technology-oriented change is needed. One that better positions rural place as something to be protected (as opposed to overcome) in order to leverage the best of both what technology and place have to offer in changing rural communities.","Wargo, Elizabeth; Carr Chellman, Davin; Budge, Kathleen; Canfield Davis, Kathryn",J.

This multimodal effort enables new opportunities for analyzing the impacts such a pandemic has on the pulse of society. Our preliminary results show that the number of COVID-19-related news articles published immediately after the World Health Organization declared the pandemic on March 11, and that since that time have steadily decreased---regardless of changes in the number of cases or public policies. Additionally, we found that politically moderate and scientifically-grounded sources have, relative to baselines measured before the beginning of the pandemic, published a lower proportion of COVID-19 news than more politically extreme sources. We suggest that further analysis of these multimodal signals could produce meaningful social insights and present an interactive dashboard to aid further exploration.","Krieg, Steven J.; Schnur, Jennifer J.; Marshall, Jermaine D.; Schoenbauer, Matthew M.; Chawla, Nitesh V.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.05983v1.pdf,570
338054,"Hospitality, tourism, human rights and the impact of COVID-19",2020,"Interest in Baccharis linearis has increased as an alternative for assisted phytostabilization due to its spontaneous colonization of tailings dumps. The search for a novel fast-vegetative propagation technique to accelerate its coverage on mine tailings is a promising research area for sustainable mine closure plans. In this study, we determined the optimal proportion of compost and tailings as growing media to promote fast B. linearis propagation through a compound layering technique. The assessed growing substrates were: 100% tailings, 70% tailings + 30% compost, and 50% tailings + 50% compost. After 84 days of growth, the change in number and height of layering branches, root and shoot dry mass, percentage of ground coverage, and substrate chemical properties were assessed. The main results showed that compound layering of B. linearis is possible with compost addition. The growth of new roots and layering branches was significantly improved by either 30% or 50% compost addition into tailings, due to chemical improvements of substrate (higher nutrients and pH and decreased copper bioavailability). The study confirms that the compound layering of B. linearis may be an effective and novel technique for speeding the reclamation of post-operative mine tailings, which is improved by the incorporation of compost.","Ginocchio, Rosanna; de la Fuente, Luz María; Orrego, Fabiola; Díaz, María José; Báez, Javiera; Ovalle, Juan Francisco",Int J Phytoremediation,,570

As the field continues to evolve, the criteria for referral and listing have also changed. The last update to these guidelines was in 2014 and several studies since then have changed how patients are transplanted. Our article aims to briefly discuss these updates in lung transplantation. RECENT FINDINGS: This article discusses the importance of early referral of patients for lung transplantation and the concept of the 'transplant window'. We review the referral and listing criteria for some common pulmonary diseases and also cite the updated literature surrounding the absolute and relative contraindications keeping in mind that they are a constantly moving target. Frailty and psychosocial barriers are difficult to assess with the current assessment tools but continue to impact posttransplant outcomes. Finally, we discuss the limited data on transplantation in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to COVID19 as well as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation bridge to transplantation. SUMMARY: The findings discussed in this article will strongly impact, if not already, how we select candidates for lung transplantation. It also addresses some aspects of lung transplant such as frailty and ARDS, which need better assessment tools and clinical data.","Shah, Purav; Neujahr, David C",Curr Opin Organ Transplant,,570

In this paper, we provide a consensus statement on the clinical practice changes in ECT specific to older adults based on expert group discussions of ECT practitioners across the country and a systematic review of the literature. There is a universal consensus that ECT is an essential treatment of severe mental illness. In addition, there is a clear consensus on what modifications are imperative to ensure continued delivery of ECT in a manner that is safe for patients and staff, while maintaining the viability of ECT services. Approaches to modifications in ECT to address infection control, altered ECT procedures, and adjusting ECT operations are almost uniform across the globe. With modified ECT procedures, it is possible to continue to meet the needs of older patients while mitigating risk of transmission to this vulnerable population.","Lapid, Maria I; Seiner, Stephen; Heintz, Hannah; Hermida, Adriana P; Nykamp, Louis; Sanghani, Sohag N; Mueller, Martina; Petrides, Georgios; Forester, Brent P",Am J Geriatr Psychiatry,,570
349322,Poorly known aspects of flattening the curve of COVID-19,2020,"Forecasting influenza in a timely manner aids health organizations and policymakers in adequate preparation and decision making. However, effective influenza forecasting still remains a challenge despite increasing research interest. It is even more challenging amidst the COVID pandemic, when the influenza-like illness (ILI) counts are affected by various factors such as symptomatic similarities with COVID-19 and shift in healthcare seeking patterns of the general population. Under the current pandemic, historical influenza models carry valuable expertise about the disease dynamics but face difficulties adapting. Therefore, we propose CALI-NET, a neural transfer learning architecture which allows us to 'steer' a historical disease forecasting model to new scenarios where flu and COVID co-exist. Our framework enables this adaptation by automatically learning when it should emphasize learning from COVID-related signals and when it should learn from the historical model. Thus, we exploit representations learned from historical ILI data as well as the limited COVID-related signals. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach is successful in adapting a historical forecasting model to the current pandemic. In addition, we show that success in our primary goal, adaptation, does not sacrifice overall performance as compared with state-of-the-art influenza forecasting approaches.","Rodriguez, A.; Muralidhar, N.; Adhikari, B.; Tabassum, A.; Ramakrishnan, N.; Prakash, B.

These very legitimate questions are directly the consequence of the recent recognition of the fundamental role of ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) in COVID-19 infection. Indeed, SARS COV2 utilizes ACE2 as a membrane receptor to enter target cells. Consequently, the putative impact of drugs modulating the renin-angiotensin system on the risk of developing severe or fatal severe acute respiratory syndrome in case of COVID-19 infection emerged. As a membrane-bound enzyme (carboxypeptidase), ACE2 inactivates angiotensin II and therefore physiologically counters its effects. Due to a different structure compared with ACE1, ACE2 is insensitive to ACEIs. In vitro, both ARBs and ACEi appear able to upregulate ACE2 tissue expression and activity but these results were not confirmed in Humans. The exact impact of both ARBs and ACEis on COVID-19 infection is definitively known and preliminary results are even in favor of a protective role confers by these drugs. Due to the crucial role of ACE2, some groups support the hypothesis that a modulation of ACE2 expression could represent a valuable therapeutic target could confer protective properties against inflammatory tissue damage in COVID-19 infection. So, studies are currently ongoing to test the impact of elevated ACE2 membrane expression, administration of ARB and infusion of soluble ACE2. In summary, based on the currently available evidences and as recommended by several medical societies, ACEi or ARB should not be systematically discontinued because to date no safety signal was raised with the use of these drugs.","Alexandre, Joachim; Cracowski, Jean-Luc; Richard, Vincent; Bouhanick, Béatrice",Therapie,,570

BACKGROUND: Patients with CLTI and/or DFI are at risk of amputations if not treated in a timely manner. METHODS: We compared the outcomes in patients with CLTI or DFI during two periods; Period 1[P1] (15/03/2019-31/05/2019) and period 2[P2] (15/03/2020-31/05/2020- corresponding to COVID-19 pandemic). RESULTS: 139 patients were treated in P1 [mean age 70 years (±11), Male:Female=102:37] while 95 patients were treated in P2 [mean age 67(±12), Male:Female=64:31]. The two cohorts were matched regarding Rutherford category (P=0.25) and GLASS classification (P=0.38). Notably, the time from onset of symptom to clinical presentation was significantly longer [31(1-105) days vs 27(0-78) days, (P=0.017)], whereas the time from presentation to first intervention was significantly shorter [3 (0-61) days vs 5 (0-65) days, (P=0.013)] in P2 compared to P1. There was a significantly higher WCC(P=0.014) and CRP(P=0.004) on admission in P2. Having treatment for CLTI or DFI in P2 was an independent predictor of worse primary patency rate and Freedom from major adverse limb events (F-MALE). At 90 days, amputation-free survival (AFS) and Limb salvage (LS) were noticeably worse in P2 compared to P1 (AFS was 80% and 87% while LS was 64% and 72% in P2 and P1 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CLTI and DFI experienced a significantly delayed presentation with features of sepsis on admission in P2. Treatment in P2 was a predictor of worse primary patency and F-MALE and therefore close and long follow-up is advisable.","Musajee, Mustafa; Zayed, Hany; Thulasidasan, Narayanan; Sayed, Mohamed; Francia, Federica; Green, Meryl; Arissol, Martin; Lakhani, Alpa; Biasi, Lukla; Patel, Sanjay",Ann. surg,,570
350132,Troubles digestifs révélateurs de la COVID-19 chez une patiente sous chimiothérapie pour cancer du sein au Mali./ [Gastrointestinal symptoms revealing COVID-19 in Malian breast cancer patient undergoing chemotherapy],2020,"BACKGROUND: Since its outbreak in January 2020, COVID-19 has quickly spread worldwide and has become a global pandemic. Social media platforms have been recognized as important tools for health-promoting practices in public health, and the use of social media is widespread among the public. However, little is known about the effects of social media use on health promotion during a pandemic such as COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to explore the predictive role of social media use on public preventive behaviors in China during the COVID-19 pandemic and how disease knowledge and eHealth literacy moderated the relationship between social media use and preventive behaviors. METHODS: A national web-based cross-sectional survey was conducted by a proportionate probability sampling among 802 Chinese internet users (""netizens"") in February 2020. Descriptive statistics, Pearson correlations, and hierarchical multiple regressions were employed to examine and explore the relationships among all the variables. RESULTS: Almost half the 802 study participants were male (416, 51.9%), and the average age of the participants was 32.65 years. Most of the 802 participants had high education levels (624, 77.7%), had high income >¥5000 (US $736.29) (525, 65.3%), were married (496, 61.8%), and were in good health (486, 60.6%). The average time of social media use was approximately 2 to 3 hours per day (mean 2.34 hours, SD 1.11), and the most frequently used media types were public social media (mean score 4.49/5, SD 0.78) and aggregated social media (mean score 4.07/5, SD 1.07). Social media use frequency (ß=.20, P<.001) rather than time significantly predicted preventive behaviors for COVID-19. Respondents were also equipped with high levels of disease knowledge (mean score 8.15/10, SD 1.43) and eHealth literacy (mean score 3.79/5, SD 0.59). Disease knowledge (ß=.11, P=.001) and eHealth literacy (ß=.27, P<.001) were also significant predictors of preventive behaviors. Furthermore, eHealth literacy (P=.038) and disease knowledge (P=.03) positively moderated the relationship between social media use frequency and preventive behaviors, while eHealth literacy (ß=.07) affected this relationship positively and disease knowledge (ß=-.07) affected it negatively. Different social media types differed in predicting an individual's preventive behaviors for COVID-19. Aggregated social media (ß=.22, P<.001) was the best predictor, followed by public social media (ß=.14, P<.001) and professional social media (ß=.11, P=.002). However, official social media (ß=.02, P=.597) was an insignificant predictor. CONCLUSIONS: Social media is an effective tool to promote behaviors to prevent COVID-19 among the public. Health literacy is essential for promotion of individual health and influences the extent to which the public engages in preventive behaviors during a pandemic. Our results not only enrich the theoretical paradigm of public health management and health communication but also have practical implications in pandemic control for China and other countries.","Li, Xiaojing; Liu, Qinliang",J Med Internet Res,,570

353132,Improvising resilience: The unfolding of resilient leadership in COVID-19 times,2021,"On the morning of November 9th 2016, the world woke up to the shocking outcome of the US Presidential elections: Donald Trump was the 45th President of the United States of America. An unexpected event that still has tremendous consequences all over the world. Today, we know that a minority of social bots, automated social media accounts mimicking humans, played a central role in spreading divisive messages and disinformation, possibly contributing to Trump's victory. In the aftermath of the 2016 US elections, the world started to realize the gravity of widespread deception in social media. Following Trump's exploit, we witnessed to the emergence of a strident dissonance between the multitude of efforts for detecting and removing bots, and the increasing effects that these malicious actors seem to have on our societies. This paradox opens a burning question: What strategies should we enforce in order to stop this social bot pandemic? In these times, during the run-up to the 2020 US elections, the question appears as more crucial than ever. What stroke social, political and economic analysts after 2016, deception and automation, has been however a matter of study for computer scientists since at least 2010. In this work, we briefly survey the first decade of research in social bot detection. Via a longitudinal analysis, we discuss the main trends of research in the fight against bots, the major results that were achieved, and the factors that make this never-ending battle so challenging. Capitalizing on lessons learned from our extensive analysis, we suggest possible innovations that could give us the upper hand against deception and manipulation. Studying a decade of endeavours at social bot detection can also inform strategies for detecting and mitigating the effects of other, more recent, forms of online deception, such as strategic information operations and political trolls.","Cresci, Stefano",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.03604v2.pdf,570

Besides the resulting health and economic disasters is the psycho-socio-cultural problem related with the management of corpses of people dead from the disease, which might hinder the implementation of the response strategy. In Cameroon for instance, the current corpse management policy is very disputed. In fact, although they were recently made more flexible, the restrictions applied to burials still ban any transfer of dead bodies between cities. In light of the African cultural considerations of dead persons, the disputes observed between the families and the health personnel, the legislation and the available scientific evidence, this article analyses the risks and benefits of allowing families to bury their relatives. It thereafter suggests solutions that reconcile dignity (by allowing families to bury their dead relatives in their homes) and safety (by ensuring a sealed handling and the surveillance by a judiciary police officer). Applying these solutions could improve the population's trust towards the health system, and positively contribute to COVID-19 case prevention, identification and management.","Timtchueng, Moise; Mapa-Tassou, Clarisse; Gnintedem, Patrick Juvet Lowe; Sontang, Hervé Martial Tchabo; Ndoungue, Mireille; Meli, Vivien; Zambou, Henri René; Choukem, Siméon Pierre",Pan Afr Med J,,570

The lockdown impact on the economy as well as on social and psychological processes is relevant, we conducted an exploratory study to examine which social factors are associated with the psychological reactions of Italians during the COVID-19 lockdown. Participants (n = 690) self-reported their social identification on three levels (i.e., Italians, Europeans and humankind), their trust toward social and political actors, and their level of welbeing, interdependent-happiness, and distress. Results showed that the relation between trust and the level of wellbeing and distress was mediated by identification with Italians and humankind, only the identification with humankind mediated the relationship between trust and the level of interdependent-happiness. The identification with Europeans did not emerge as a mediator in such relationships.

METHODS: Quantitative and qualitative historical data analysis. Total Risk Assessment (TRA) evaluation tool was used to assess the pre-pandemic stage risks, pandemic threshold fast responsiveness, and the ongoing performance until plateau. The Infected Patient Ratio (IPR) tool was developed to measure the number of patients resulting from 1 infector during the incubation period. Both IPR and TRA were used together to forecast inflection points, plateau phases, intensive care units' and ventilators' breakpoints, and the Total Fatality Ratio. RESULTS: In Italy, Spain, France, Germany, and the United States, an inflection point is predicted within the first 15 d of April, to arrive at a plateau after another 30 to 80 d. Variations in IPR drop are expected due to variations in lockdown timing by each country, the extent of adherence to it, and the number of performed tests in each.

The indication of preoperative mouthwash containing 1% hydrogen peroxide for reducing the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva prior to oral procedures has been significantly disseminated through several citations and influenced various dental associations in the elaboration of dental care protocols during this pandemic period, including patients admitted to hospital wards and intensive care units. AIM: To Our aim was to perform a systematic review to answer the following question: does hydrogen peroxide mouthwash (at any concentration) have a virucidal effect? METHODS: The Cochrane, LILACS, PubMed, Scopus, and Embase databases were searched by using the following key-words: 'hydrogen peroxide', 'mouthwash', 'mouth rinse', 'rinse', 'oral rinse', 'mouth bath', 'mouth wash', and 'mouth washes'. Reviews, letters to the editor, personal opinions, book chapters, case reports, congress abstracts, studies with animals and studies on mouthwash containing other compounds other than hydrogen peroxide were excluded. FINDINGS: During the initial search 1342 articles were identified on the five electronic databases. After excluding some duplicates, 976 articles remained. Only studies assessing the virucidal effect of hydrogen peroxide mouthwash were selected, regardless of publication date. CONCLUSION: After reading titles and abstracts, no article met the eligibility criteria. In conclusion, there is no scientific evidence supporting the indication of hydrogen peroxide mouthwash for control of the viral load regarding SARS-CoV-2 or any other viruses in saliva.","Ortega, K L; Rech, B O; El Haje, G L C; Gallo, C B; Pérez-Sayáns, M; Braz-Silva, P H",J Hosp Infect,,570

In this paper, we used micro-computed tomography scanning and infrared scanning technology to further explore the internal structure and surface chemistry of polyurethane modified materials and then established an experimental platform for the filtration performance of polyurethane modified materials. The change of suspended solids concentration and oil content in the sewage was tested under different filtration rate, filter layer thickness, and water quality. The results showed that the porosity of the filter material and the oil-absorbing material was 65.85% and 56.03% respectively, and the difference in the number of oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface of these two materials indicated different adsorption force for sewage impurities. And the polyurethane modified materials had good filtration performance. Through these experiments, we demonstrated that the quality of water filtrated by the polyurethane modified materials met the requirements of the 'National Comprehensive Wastewater Discharge Standards', and the filtration efficiency for suspended particles and oils in oily sewage was higher than 80%.

Using Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics to enhance sampling of conformational space, we identified cryptic pockets within the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, including some within regions far from the active site. These simulations sampled comparable dynamics and pocket volumes to conventional brute force simulations carried out on two orders of magnitude greater timescales.","Sztain, Terra; Amaro, Rommie; McCammon, J Andrew",J Chem Inf Model,,570

AIM: To asses efficacy of ablation for PAF in a middle-volume EP center over last years. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 1 year efficacy and safety of ablation for PAF in three cohorts of patients treated between 2011 and 2014 (period I), 2015-2017 (period II), and 2018-2019 (period III). RESULTS: Of 234 patients (mean age 57 ± 9 years, 165 males), 81 (35%) were treated in period I, 84 (36%) in period II, and 69 (29%) in period III. The overall efficacy of ablation during all analyzed periods was 67%. The overall efficacy of ablation increased over time-from 56% in period I to 68% in period II and 81% in period III. Significant improvement was achieved using radiofrequency ablation (RF) (53% in period I vs 82% in period III, and 55% in period II vs 82% in period III, p = 0.003 and 0.0012, respectively) whereas positive trend in the improvement of cryoballoon efficacy was NS. The rate of peri-procedural complications was 9% and it did not change significantly over time. CONCLUSIONS: This real-life observational study from a medium volume EP center shows that progress in PAF ablation, especially RF, reported by highly-skilled centers, can be reproduced in real life by less experienced operators.","Kulakowski, Piotr; Sikorska, Agnieszka; Piotrowski, Roman; Krynski, Tomasz; Baran, Jakub",J. interv. card. electrophysiol,,570

373345,[COVID-19 and asthma control],2021,"INTRODUCTION: Critical illness from SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) is associated with a high burden of pulmonary embolism (PE) and thromboembolic events despite standard thromboprophylaxis. Available guidance is discordant, ranging from standard care to the use of therapeutic anticoagulation for enhanced thromboprophylaxis (ET). Local ET protocols have been empirically determined and are generally intermediate between standard prophylaxis and full anticoagulation. Concerns have been raised in regard to the potential risk of haemorrhage associated with therapeutic anticoagulation. This report describes the prevalence and safety of ET strategies in European Intensive Care Unit (ICUs) and their association with outcomes during the first wave of the COVID pandemic, with particular focus on haemorrhagic complications and ICU mortality. METHODS: Retrospective, observational, multi-centre study including adult critically ill COVID-19 patients. Anonymised data included demographics, clinical characteristics, thromboprophylaxis and/or anticoagulation treatment. Critical haemorrhage was defined as intracranial haemorrhage or bleeding requiring red blood cells transfusion. Survival was collected at ICU discharge. A multivariable mixed effects generalised linear model analysis matched for the propensity for receiving ET was constructed for both ICU mortality and critical haemorrhage. RESULTS: A total of 852 (79% male, age 66 [37-85] years) patients were included from 28 ICUs. Median body mass index and ICU length of stay were 27.7 (25.1-30.7) Kg/m2 and 13 (7-22) days, respectively. Thromboembolic events were reported in 146 patients (17.1%), of those 78 (9.2%) were PE. ICU mortality occurred in 335/852 (39.3%) patients. ET was used in 274 (32.1%) patients, and it was independently associated with significant reduction in ICU mortality (log odds = 0.64 [95% CIs 0.18-1.1; p = 0.0069]) but not an increased risk of critical haemorrhage (log odds = 0.187 [95%CI - 0.591 to - 0.964; p = 0.64]). CONCLUSIONS: In a cohort of critically ill patients with a high prevalence of thromboembolic events, ET was associated with reduced ICU mortality without an increased burden of haemorrhagic complications. This study suggests ET strategies are safe and associated with favourable outcomes. Whilst full anticoagulation has been questioned for prophylaxis in these patients, our results suggest that there may nevertheless be a role for enhanced / intermediate levels of prophylaxis. Clinical trials investigating causal relationship between intermediate thromboprophylaxis and clinical outcomes are urgently needed.","Lavinio, Andrea; Ercole, Ari; Battaglini, Denise; Magnoni, Sandra; Badenes, Rafael; Taccone, Fabio Silvio; Helbok, Raimund; Thomas, William; Pelosi, Paolo; Robba, Chiara",Crit Care,,570

News reports and information about the virus are rapidly changing. We present a case of a patient with COVID-19 who had a seizure-like spell for which an EEG was performed. In early to mid-March, there were no clear guidelines or recommendations available from neurodiagnostic-related organizations or hospitals on how to adapt procedure workflow to those with COVID-19. When caring for COVID-19 patients, as when caring for any patient with an infectious disease, it is hospital protocol to follow contact, droplet/airborne precautions by wearing appropriate PPE. However, because we knew very little about the coronavirus, this case was different. In this article, we discuss our experience with our EEG workflow and concerns for staff exposure. We then discuss our adaptations and modifications to our standard procedures and protocols. A time analysis comparing our standard EEG protocol with our modified COVID-19 protocol revealed a significant decrease in technologist exposure time (99 minutes versus 51 minutes), which theoretically would reduce the chance of virus transmission to our technologist. At this critical moment in time, we hope such modifications will allow us to continue delivering high quality patient care while optimizing resource utilization and above all keeping our technologists safe.","Haines, Seline; Caccamo, Amy; Chan, Fonda; Galaso, German; Catinchi, Alexis; Gupta, Puneet K",Neurodiagn J,,570

As of February 28, 2020, the cumulative number of reported deaths in China was 2,858. We estimated the time-delay adjusted risk for death from COVID-19 in Wuhan, as well as for China excluding Wuhan, to assess the severity of the epidemic in the country. Our estimates of the risk for death in Wuhan reached values as high as 12% in the epicenter of the epidemic and &#8776;1% in other, more mildly affected areas. The elevated death risk estimates are probably associated with a breakdown of the healthcare system, indicating that enhanced public health interventions, including social distancing and movement restrictions, should be implemented to bring the COVID-19 epidemic under control.","Mizumoto, Kenji; Chowell, Gerardo",Emerg Infect Dis,,570

We apply the model to a number of pandemic centers. Our results are in good agreement with the data to date and show that social distancing significantly reduces the epidemic spread and flattens the curve. Predictions on the spreading trajectory including the total infections and peak time of new infections for a community of any size are made weeks ahead, providing the vital information and lead time needed to prepare for and mitigate the epidemic.

At present, whether COVID-19 has an effect on thyroid function is unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate thyroid function in patients with COVID-19. Methods: Clinical manifestations, laboratory results, and chest computed tomography scans were retrospectively reviewed for 50 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 without a history of thyroid disease who underwent thyroid function testing during their course of COVID-19 infection and after recovery. They were admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, between January and March 2020. Healthy participants who underwent routine physical checkups and non-COVID-19 pneumonia patients with a similar degree of severity during the same period were included in the study as the control group. Thyroid hormone and thyrotropin (TSH) levels were analyzed and compared between the COVID-19 and control groups. Results: TSH lower than the normal range was present in 56% (28/50) of the patients with COVID-19. The levels of TSH and serum total triiodothyronine (TT3) of the patients with COVID-19 were significantly lower than those of the healthy control group and non-COVID-19 pneumonia patients. The more severe the COVID-19, the lower the TSH and TT3 levels were, with statistical significance (p < 0.001). The degree of the decreases in TSH and TT3 levels was positively correlated with the severity of the disease. The total thyroxine (TT4) level of the patients with COVID-19 was not significantly different from the control group. All the patients did not receive thyroid hormone replacement therapy. After recovery, no significant differences in TSH, TT3, TT4, free triiodothyronine (fT3), and free thyroxine (fT4) levels were found between the COVID-19 and control groups. Conclusions: The changes in serum TSH and TT3 levels may be important manifestations of the courses of COVID-19.","Chen, Min; Zhou, Weibin; Xu, Weiwei",Thyroid,,570

The review focuses on the challenges faced by ECRs and how these compare to the ones more senior researchers have to tackle. In the examination of the literature three general questions are posed: Q1) What are the identifiable and forthcoming impacts of the pandemic-induced financial pressures felt in the Higher Education sector on ECRs' employment and career development prospects? Q2) What are the identifiable and forthcoming pandemic-associated disruptions in the pace/focus/direction of the research undertaking? Have any disruptions been predicted to exert an impact on ECRs' research activities, and if so, with what scholarly consequences? Q3) How is the work-life of ECRs shaping up under the virus-dictated rules of the 'new normal' in the research undertaking? What challenges, if any, arise from the changes in practices identified, and what might their potential consequences be for ECRs?

The gold standard for its diagnosis is the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, but considering the high number of infected people, the low availability of this diagnostic tool in some contexts, and the limitations of the test, other tools that aid in the identification of the disease are necessary. In this scenario, imaging exams such as chest X-ray (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) have played important roles. CXR is useful for assessing disease progression because it allows the detection of extensive consolidations, besides being a fast and cheap method. On the other hand, CT is more sensitive for detecting lung changes in the early stages of the disease and is also useful for assessing disease progression. Of note, ground-glass opacities are the main COVID-19-related CT findings. Positron emission tomography combined with CT can be used to evaluate chronic and substantial damage to the lungs and other organs;however, it is an expensive test. Lung ultrasound (LUS) has been shown to be a promising technique in that context as well, being useful in the screening and monitoring of patients, disease classification, and management related to mechanical ventilation. Moreover, LUS is an inexpensive alternative available at the bedside. Finally, magnetic resonance imaging, although not usually requested, allows the detection of pulmonary, cardiovascular, and neurological abnormalities associated with COVID-19. Furthermore, it is important to consider the challenges faced in the radiology field in the adoption of control measures to prevent infection and in the follow-up of post-COVID-19 patients.","de Carvalho, L.

The spatial dissemination of droplets varies according to their initial velocity. After a short literature review, our goal was to determine the velocity of the exhaled air during vocal exercises. METHODS: A propylene glycol cloud produced by 2 e-cigarettes' users allowed visualization of the exhaled air emitted during vocal exercises. Airflow velocities were measured during the first 200 ms of a long exhalation, a sustained vowel /a/ and varied vocal exercises. For the long exhalation and the sustained vowel /a/, the decrease of airflow velocity was measured until 3 s. Results were compared with a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) study using boundary conditions consistent with our experimental study. RESULTS: Regarding the production of vowels, higher velocities were found in loud and whispered voices than in normal voice. Voiced consonants like /Ê/ or /v/ generated higher velocities than vowels. Some voiceless consonants, e.g., /t/ generated high velocities, but long exhalation had the highest velocities. Semi-occluded vocal tract exercises generated faster airflow velocities than loud speech, with a decreased velocity during voicing. The initial velocity quickly decreased as was shown during a long exhalation or a sustained vowel /a/. Velocities were consistent with the CFD data. CONCLUSION: Initial velocity of the exhaled air is a key factor influencing droplets trajectory. Our study revealed that vocal exercises produce a slower airflow than long exhalation. Speech therapy should, therefore, not be associated with an increased risk of contamination when implementing standard recommendations.","Giovanni, Antoine; Radulesco, Thomas; Bouchet, Gilles; Mattei, Alexia; Révis, Joana; Bogdanski, Estelle; Michel, Justin",Eur. arch. oto-rhino-laryngol,,570

Conclusion: Teleconsultation is here to stay beyond the pandemic. WhatsApp was the preferred modality of communication for us. Teleophthalmology has given us insights to use this evolving technology to reach out to the population at large to provide eye care services. We believe that this mode of teleophthalmology has helped us in providing feasible eye care to the patients.","Ravindran, Meenakshi; Segi, Ashwin; Mohideen, Syed; Allapitchai, Fathima; Rengappa, Ramakrishna",Indian J Ophthalmol,,570

METHODS: We conducted a single-blind, randomised, controlled, clinical trial involving severe hospitalised patients with confirmed COVID-19 at the early pulmonary phase of the illness in Iran. The patients were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio by block randomisation method to receive standard care with methylprednisolone pulse (intravenous injection, 250â mg·day-1 for 3â days) or standard care alone. The study endpoint was the time of clinical improvement or death, whichever came first. Primary and safety analysis was done in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. RESULTS: Sixty-eight eligible patients underwent randomisation (34 patients in each group) from April 20, till Jun 20, 2020. In the standard care group, six patients received corticosteroids by the attending physician during treatment and excluded from the ITT population. Patients with clinical improvement were higher in the methylprednisolone group than in the standard care group (94·1% versus 57·1%), and the mortality rate was numerically lower in the methylprednisolone group (5·9% versus 42.9%; p <0·001). We demonstrated that patients in the methylprednisolone intervention group had a significantly increased survival time compared with the patients in the standard care group [Log rank test: p<0.001; Hazard ratio: 0.293; 95% C I: 0. 154-0.556]. A total of two patients in each group (5·8% and 7·1% respectively) showed severe adverse events between initiation of treatment and the end of the study. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that methylprednisolone pulse could be an efficient therapeutic agent for hospitalised severe COVID-19 patients at the pulmonary phase.","Edalatifard, Maryam; Akhtari, Maryam; Salehi, Mohammadreza; Naderi, Zohre; Jamshidi, Ahmadreza; Mostafaei, Shayan; Najafizadeh, Seyed Reza; Farhadi, Elham; Jalili, Nooshin; Esfahani, Masoud; Rahimi, Besharat; Kazemzadeh, Hossein; Mahmoodi Aliabadi, Maedeh; Ghazanfari, Tooba; Satarian, Mohammad Reza; Ebrahimi Louyeh, Hourvash; Raeeskarami, Seyed Reza; Jamali Moghadam Siahkali, Saeidreza; Khajavirad, Nasim; Mahmoudi, Mahdi; Rostamian, Abdorahman",Eur. respir. j,,570

397779,Stock Liquidity and Firm Value in the Time of COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Previous research has identified both goal orientation and ruminative flooding as potential risk factors for suicidal thoughts and behaviors, as well as positive associations between goal orientation and rumination. The present study examined whether the association between goal orientation and suicidal thoughts and behaviors, assessed one month later, was accounted for by ruminative flooding. A sample of 924 psychiatric outpatients (Mage = 39.09 years, SD = 14.82, range = 18 to 84; 61.7% female; 37.0% White) completed self-report and interview measures at baseline and provided information about suicide-related outcomes at one-month follow-up. Goal orientation was positively associated with ruminative flooding, and both goal orientation and ruminative flooding were associated with suicidal thoughts and behaviors at one-month follow-up. Controlling for lifetime suicidal thoughts and behaviors, as well as patient age and sexual orientation, ruminative flooding accounted for the relationship between goal orientation and suicidal thoughts and behaviors at one-month follow-up. These findings were especially relevant for individuals with a history of multiple suicide attempts. Overall, this study provided evidence that difficulties with goal orientation may relate to suicidal thoughts and behaviors through intense ruminations perceived as a loss of cognitive control. Interventions that address ruminative thinking and cognitive flexibility may, in turn, assist in reducing emotion dysregulation and managing suicidality among those who struggle with goal orientation.","Rogers, Megan L; Cao, Erjia; Sinclair, Courtney; Galynker, Igor",Behav Res Ther,,570

METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study including all adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to Hospital Universitario Marqués de Valdecilla from February to May 2020. Patients were stratified according to COVID-GRAM and CURB-65 scores as being at low-medium or high risk of critical illness. Univariate analysis, multivariate logistic regression models, receiver operating characteristic curve, and area under the curve (AUC) were calculated. RESULTS: A total of 523 patients were included (51.8% male, 48.2% female; mean age 65.63 years (standard deviation 17.89 years)), of whom 110 (21%) presented a critical illness (intensive care unit admission 10.3%, 30-day mortality 13.8%). According to the COVID-GRAM score, 122 (23.33%) patients were classified as high risk; 197 (37.7%) presented a CURB-65 score &#8805;2.

411989,Cutibacterium spp. isolated from orthopaedic implant-associated infection: A not-so-slowly growing organism,2020,"Heavy metals are considered to be among the leading environmental factors that trigger amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, no convincing biopathological mechanism and therapeutic clinical implication of such metals in ALS pathogenesis have been established. This is partly attributable to the technical and scientific difficulties in demonstrating a direct and causative role of heavy metals in the onset of ALS in patients. However, a body of epidemiological, clinical and experimental evidences suggest that lead (Pb), more than other metals, could actually play a major role in the onset and progression of ALS. Here, to clarify the nature of the association and the causative role of Pb in ALS, we comprehensively reviewed the scientific literature of the last decade with objective database searches and the methods typically adopted in systematic reviews, critically analysing and summarising the various scientifically sound evidence on the relationship between ALS and Pb. From these tasks, we noted a number of multidisciplinary associations between ALS and Pb, and specifically the importance of occupational exposure to Pb in ALS development and/or progression. We also report the possible involvement of TAR DNA binding protein (TDP-43)-based molecular mechanism in Pb-mediated ALS, although these data rely on a single study, which included both in vitro experiments and an animal model, and are therefore still preliminary. Finally, we briefly examined whether this knowledge could inspire new targeted therapies and policies in the fight against ALS.","Farace, Cristiano; Fenu, Grazia; Lintas, Simone; Oggiano, Riccardo; Pisano, Andrea; Sabalic, Angela; Solinas, Giuliana; Bocca, Beatrice; Forte, Giovanni; Madeddu, Roberto",Neurotoxicology,,570
412142,Online and face-to-face learning: Evidence from students’ performance during the Covid-19 pandemic,2021,"Major public health emergencies would have a negative influence on the psychology of the public, and an effective psychological intervention can help them to relieve some emotions, such as tension and panic. However, differences in individual environments affect people's psychological intervention demands and intervention mode choices. Therefore, it is of great theoretical and practical value to analyze and identify the key factors affecting these demands and choices.

A total of 1318 participants (mean age 47.8 SD12.6; 82.1% women) were recruited through social media in Sweden during autumn 2020. The survey included questions regarding perceived changes in PA compared to the previous year, the ""Rating of Perceived Capacity"" scale and ""Life Satisfaction Questionnaire-11"". A change in PA was reported by 65% of participants. More participants reported an increase (36%) than a decrease (29%), however a decrease in PA was significantly more often considered to be due to the pandemic. The highest odds of decreased PA was found in the oldest age group (70+ years) (OR 2.8; 95% CI 1.4-5.7). Those who reported decreased levels of PA reported lower life satisfaction and aerobic capacity than the other groups (p > 0.001). Decreased physical activity was reported by many, but an equal share reported increased activity during the pandemic. The highest odds for decreased activity was found in the oldest group-the group that has been subjected to the strictest recommended COVID-19 restrictions in Sweden.","Eek, Frida; Larsson, Caroline; Wisén, Anita; Ekvall Hansson, Eva",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,570

Here, we use a sero-survey to estimate the seroprevalence of IgG antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the St. Louis, MO, metropolitan area in a symptom-independent manner. Five hundred three adult and 555 pediatric serum/plasma samples were collected from patients presenting to Barnes-Jewish Hospital or St. Louis Children's Hospital between 14 April 2020 and 12 May 2020. We developed protocols for in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) using spike and nucleoprotein and used the assays to estimate a seroprevalence rate based on our samples. Overall IgG seropositivity was estimated to be 1.71% (95% credible interval [CI], 0.04% to 3.38%) in pediatric samples and 3.11% (95% CI, 0.92% to 5.32%) in adult samples. Seropositivity was significantly lower in children under 5 years of age than in adults, but rates between adults and children aged 5 or older were similar. Of the 176 samples tested from children under 4 years of age, none were positive.IMPORTANCE This study determined the percentages of both children and adult samples from the greater St. Louis metropolitan area who had antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in late April to early May 2020. Approximately 1.7 to 3.1% of the tested individuals had antibodies, indicating that they had previously been infected by SARS-CoV-2. These results demonstrate that the extent of infection was about 10 times greater than the number of confirmed cases at that time. Furthermore, it demonstrated that by 5 years of age, children were infected to an extent similar to that of adults.","Smith, Brittany K; Janowski, Andrew B; Danis, Jonathan E; Harvey, Ian B; Zhao, Haiyan; Dai, Ya-Nan; Farnsworth, Christopher W; Gronowski, Ann M; Roper, Stephen; Fremont, Daved H; Wang, David",MSphere,,570

This is particularly pronounced under the periodic boundary conditions commonly used in molecular simulations. In this article, the dielectric properties of a water model whose intermolecular electrostatic interactions are entirely short-ranged are investigated. This is done within the framework of local molecular-field theory (LMFT), which provides a well-controlled mean-field treatment of long-ranged electrostatics. This short-ranged model gives a remarkably good performance on a number of counts, and its apparent shortcomings are readily accounted for. These results not only lend support to LMFT as an approach for understanding solvation behavior, but also are relevant to those developing interaction potentials based on local descriptions of liquid structure.","Cox, Stephen J",Proc.

Hypertensive retinopathy can be divided into chronic and acute phases. A cross-sectional study was performed to explore a method of measurement in the diameters of retinal vessels for diagnosis of chronic hypertensive retinopathy based on spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). The central retinal artery diameter (CRAD), the central retinal vein diameter (CRVD), and the artery-to-vein ratio (AVR) were measured. A total of 119 subjects with 119 eyes were included in this study, in which 56 subjects with 56 eyes were included in hypertensive group and 63 subjects with 63 eyes were included in normotensive group. There were significant differences between the two groups in the CRAD (t = -2.14, P = .04) and the AVR (t = -2.59, P = .01). The cutoff point of 0.75 was determined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (area under the curve, AUC 0.786; 95% confidence interval, 95% CI 0.70-0.87). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed the probability of AVR below to 0.75 was more in patients with high systolic blood pressure (odds ratio OR 4.39; P = .048), more in male (OR 4.15; P = .004) and more in smokers (OR 5.80; P = .01). Bland-Altman plots showed small mean bias between the measurements of the two technicians in the CRAD, the CRVD, and the AVR. In summary, application of SD-OCT is an accurate, reproducible, convenient method for measuring the diameters of retinal vessels. It is valuable for the diagnosis of chronic stage of hypertensive retinopathy.","Feng, Xue; Wang, Haiwei; Kong, Yuanyuan; Zhang, Junyan; He, Jingfang; Zhang, Bozheng; Zhang, Jianqiang; Qi, Hong; Wang, Yanling",J. clin. hypertens.

It's little wonder that the plague mask in the collection of the German Museum of the History of Medicine in Ingolstadt (Bavaria) is one of the museum's most popular objects and motifs. This forum paper investigates the figure of the plague doctor on several levels: first, it analyses contemporary textual and image sources in regard to protective clothing used in times of plague and the respective role of the beak-like part of the mask. Then it takes a close look at the Ingolstadt specimen. By examining the mask's materiality and fabrication, questions of its authenticity and practicability are raised. Finally, the Ingolstadt mask is compared with the specimen at the German Historical Museum in Berlin.The conclusion: the beak mask is not mentioned before the mid-seventeenth century, and then only in Italy and Southern France. There is no proof at all of its use during plague outbreaks in Middle Europe. And the specimens in Ingolstadt and Berlin? Both masks present details which suggest that they were not used as protective clothing at all.

DesignA retrospective study was conducted in children (0-18 years), admitted in two pediatric hospitals of Rio de Janeiro city, between January 17 and July 3, 2021 with confirmed COVID-19 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction or serological tests. Trends of COVID-19 pediatric admissions number during the first 24 weeks of COVID-19 vaccination in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and the pre-vaccine period were measured by linear regression. ParticipantsChildren admitted in pediatric hospitals in Rio de Janeiro, city, Brazil ResultsThe number of total admitted patients (with all diseases) were 5340 during the pre-vaccine period, being 94 (1.8%) of them with confirmed COVID-19, and 4182 children admitted during the vaccine period, with 86 confirmed COVID-19 patients (2.1 %) (p=0.29). Media of cases admitted per/week were 2.02 in pre-vaccine period and 3.6 during the first 24 weeks of COVID vaccination (p=0.009). One death was reported in the pre-vaccine period and four in the vaccine period (p=0.14). Trends of increase in the number of admitted cases were verified both in the pre-vaccine period as in the vaccine period, being more expressive in the last one. ConclusionThere was trend of increase in number of children admitted with confirmed COVID-19 during the first 24 weeks of COVID-vaccination in Rio de Janeiro, city. Considering that few people were fully vaccinated, reducing of number of admitted children with confirmed COVID-19 was not verified.","Silva, Andre Ricardo Araujo da; Esteves, Monica Del Monaco; Carvalho, Bernardo Rodrigues Rosa de; Souza, Cristina Vieira; Teixeira, Cristiane Henriques",,,570
425690,Effects of COVID-19 on hotel marketing and management: a perspective article,2020,"Influenza A virus may circulate simultaneously with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, leading to more serious respiratory diseases during this winter. However, the influence of these viruses on disease outcome when both influenza A and SARS-CoV-2 are present in the host remains unclear. Using a mammalian model, sequential infection was performed in ferrets and in K18-hACE2 mice, with SARS-CoV-2 infection following H1N1. We found that co-infection with H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2 extended the duration of clinical manifestation of COVID-19, and enhanced pulmonary damage, but reduced viral shedding of throat swabs and viral loads in the lungs of ferrets. Moreover, mortality was increased in sequentially infected mice compared with single-infection mice. Compared with single-vaccine inoculation, co-inoculation of PiCoVacc (a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine) and the flu vaccine showed no significant differences in neutralizing antibody titers or virus-specific immune responses. Combined immunization effectively protected K18-hACE2 mice against both H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our findings indicated the development of systematic models of co-infection of H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2, which together notably enhanced pneumonia in ferrets and mice, as well as demonstrated that simultaneous vaccination against H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2 may be an effective prevention strategy for the coming winter.","Bao, Linlin; Deng, Wei; Qi, Feifei; Lv, Qi; Song, Zhiqi; Liu, Jiangning; Gao, Hong; Wei, Qiang; Yu, Pin; Xu, Yanfeng; Qu, Yajin; Li, Fengdi; Xue, Jing; Gong, Shuran; Liu, Mingya; Wang, Guanpeng; Wang, Shunyi; Zhao, Binbin; Cong, Bin; Qin, Chuan",Signal Transduct Target Ther,,570

The virus causes relatively minor damage to young, healthy populations, imposing life-threatening danger to the elderly and people with diseases of chronic inflammation. Therefore, if we could reduce the risk for vulnerable populations, it would make the COVID-19 pandemic more similar to other typical outbreaks. Children don't suffer from COVID-19 as much as their grandparents and have a much higher melatonin level. Bats are nocturnal animals possessing high levels of melatonin, which may contribute to their high anti-viral resistance. Viruses induce an explosion of inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species, and melatonin is the best natural antioxidant that is lost with age. The programmed cell death coronaviruses cause, which can result in significant lung damage, is also inhibited by melatonin. Coronavirus causes inflammation in the lungs which requires inflammasome activity. Melatonin blocks these inflammasomes. General immunity is impaired by anxiety and sleep deprivation. Melatonin improves sleep habits, reduces anxiety and stimulates immunity. Fibrosis may be the most dangerous complication after COVID-19. Melatonin is known to prevent fibrosis. Mechanical ventilation may be necessary but yet imposes risks due to oxidative stress, which can be reduced by melatonin. Thus, by using the safe over-the-counter drug melatonin, we may be immediately able to prevent the development of severe disease symptoms in coronavirus patients, reduce the severity of their symptoms, and/or reduce the immuno-pathology of coronavirus infection on patients' health after the active phase of the infection is over.","Shneider, Alex; Kudriavtsev, Aleksandr; Vakhrusheva, Anna",Int Rev Immunol,,570
432120,Implications of COVID-19 Pandemic on China’s Exports,2021,"BACKGROUND & AIM: The aim of this systematic review was to quantify the association between frailty and COVID-19 in relation to mortality in hospitalised patients. METHODS: Medline, Embase, Web of Science and the grey literature were searched for papers from inception to 10th September 2020; the search was re-run in Medline up until the 9th December 2020. Screening, data extraction and quality grading were undertaken by two reviewers. Results were summarised using descriptive statistics, including a meta-analysis of overall mortality; the relationships between frailty and COVID-19 mortality were summarised narratively. RESULTS: 2,286 papers were screened resulting in 26 being included in the review. Most studies were from Europe, half from the UK, and one from Brazil; the median sample size was 242.5, median age 73.1 and 43.5% were female. 22/26 used the Clinical Frailty Scale; reported mortality ranged from 14 to 65%. Most, but not all studies showed an association between increasing frailty and a greater risk of dying. Two studies indicated a sub-additive relationship between frailty, COVID-19 and death, and two studies showed no association. CONCLUSIONS: Whilst the majority of studies have shown a positive association between COVID-19 related death and increasing frailty, some studies suggested a more nuanced understanding of frailty and outcomes in COVID-19 is needed. Clinicians should exert caution in placing too much emphasis on the influence of frailty alone when discussing likely prognosis in older people with COVID-19 illness.","Cosco, Theodore D; Best, John; Davis, Daniel; Bryden, Daniele; Arkill, Suzanne; van Oppen, James; Riadi, Indira; Wagner, Kevin R; Conroy, Simon",Age ageing,,570

In this context, automatic summarization has substantial importance as it will provide the foundation for big data analytic. Traditional summarization approaches optimize the system to produce a short static summary that fits all users that do not consider the subjectivity aspect of summarization, i.e., what is deemed valuable for different users, making these approaches impractical in real-world use cases. This paper proposes an interactive concept-based summarization model, called Adaptive Summaries, that helps users make their desired summary instead of producing a single inflexible summary. The system learns from users' provided information gradually while interacting with the system by giving feedback in an iterative loop. Users can choose either reject or accept action for selecting a concept being included in the summary with the importance of that concept from users' perspectives and confidence level of their feedback. The proposed approach can guarantee interactive speed to keep the user engaged in the process. Furthermore, it eliminates the need for reference summaries, which is a challenging issue for summarization tasks. Evaluations show that Adaptive Summaries helps users make high-quality summaries based on their preferences by maximizing the user-desired content in the generated summaries.","Ghodratnama, Samira; Zakershahrak, Mehrdad; Sobhanmanesh, Fariborz",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.13387v1.pdf,570

We evaluated a screening strategy combining chest computed-tomography (CT) and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for patients treated with radiotherapy (RT) in our cancer center located in a COVID-19 French hotspot during the first wave of the pandemic. METHODS: Chest CT images were proposed during the radiotherapy CT simulation. Images were reviewed by an expert radiologist according to the CO-RADS classification. Nasal swabs with RT PCR assay were initially proposed in case of suspicious imaging or clinical context and were eventually integrated into the systematic screening. A dedicated radiotherapy workflow was proposed for COVID-19 patients to limit the risk of contamination. RESULTS: From March 18, 2020 to May 1, 2020, 480 patients were screened by chest CT, with 313 patients having both chest CT and RT-PCR (65%). Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was 5.4%, 95%CI [3.6, 7.8] (26 patients out of 480). Diagnosis of COVID-19 was made before RT for 22 patients (84.6%) and during RT for 4 patients (15.3%). Chest CT directly aided the diagnosis of 7 cases for whom the initial RT-PCR was negative or not feasible; out of a total of 480 patients (1.5%) and 517 chest CT acquisition. Four patients with COVID-19 at the time of the chest CT screening had a false negative CT. Sensitivity and specificity of chest CT screening in patients with both RT-PCR and chest CT testing were estimated to be 0.82, 95% CI [0.60, 0.95] and 0.98, 95% CI [0.96, 0.99] respectively.Adaptation of the radiotherapy treatment was made for all the patients with seven postponed treatments (median=5 days, IQR [1.5, 14.8]).

441713,Patients' perceptions of teleconsultation during COVID-19: A cross-national study,2020,"In recent years the COVID pandemic has influenced education significantly. The pace of digital transformation is very fast and requires a change of mindset. Translators or cross-language mediators have to work at the focal point of various information transfer processes. We think that a digital mindset of a future translator can be created by re-contextualising classroom communication reality with online teaching tools that will ensure synchronous and asynchronous studies. The challenges of online resources variety can be responded to by classifying them according to L2 communicative competence and translation competence structural components. Thus the choice of sources can be narrowed down according to specific teaching objectives. The research proposes a classification of online resources for mediation competence development which is a communicative competence component according to CEFR. Classification categories include online teaching tools that can help develop (1) skills of mediating concepts, texts, communication;(2) strategies of explaining new concepts and strategies of text simplification. The classification is used to work out a few sample activities for an L2 course within translation curriculum. It is assumed that the classification and sample activities will help teachers be more flexible facing distance learning challenges in translation teaching. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2021.","Enbaeva, L.; Plastinina, N.","2021 Ural Environmental Science Forum on Sustainable Development of Industrial Region, UESF 2021",,570

Using the filtering fusion algorithm proposed in this paper, after the Kalman filter (KF) filters the raw data of the attitude sensor, explicit complementary filtering and data fusion are used to obtain the attitude angle of the body. At the same time, the obtained attitude angle is combined with acceleration and blood oxygen concentration to obtain the behaviour characteristic value. On this basis, the speed of the oxygen supply fan captured by the photoelectric sensor is used to form a closed loop with the characteristic value of the behaviour. Finally, the structure of the mask is upgraded and optimized through fluid mechanics simulation, and experiments have verified that the combination of the replaceable filter cloth, the intelligent control system and the ultraviolet disinfection device can effectively protect people's health.","Xia, Kun; Li, Xiang; Li, Xueyong; Liu, Yiren; Zhang, Hongwei; Hou, Ruifeng",,,570

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Otolaryngology Clinic of the University Polyclinic A. Gemelli, IRCCS Foundation. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: All patients with voice prosthesis who underwent laryngectomy followed by our institute were offered enrollment. Patients who agreed to participate were interviewed to inquire about the nature of the need and to plan a video call with the appropriate clinician. Before and 1 week after the clinician's call, patients were tested with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Degrees of satisfaction were investigated with a visual analog scale. A comparison between those who accepted and refused telematic support was carried out to identify factors that influence patient interest in teleservice. RESULTS: Video call service allowed us to reach 37 (50.68%) of 73 patients. In 23 (62.16%) of 37 cases, the video call was sufficient to manage the problem. In the remaining 14 cases (37.83%), an outpatient visit was necessary. Participants who refused telematic support had a significantly shorter time interval from the last ear, nose, and throat visit than patients who accepted (57.95 vs 96.14 days, P = .03). Video-called patients showed significantly decreased levels of anxiety and depression (mean Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale total score pre- vs post-video call: 13.97 vs. 10.23, P < .0001) and reported high levels of satisfaction about the service.

454627,Sierra Leone – Pandemic Politics,2020,"When vaccines are in limited supply, expanding the number of people who receive some vaccine, such as by halving doses or increasing the interval between doses, can reduce disease and mortality compared with concentrating available vaccine doses in a subset of the population. A corollary of such dose-sparing strategies is that the vaccinated individuals may have less protective immunity. Concerns have been raised that expanding the fraction of the population with partial immunity to SARS-CoV-2 could increase selection for vaccine-escape variants, ultimately undermining vaccine effectiveness. We argue that, although this is possible, preliminary evidence instead suggests such strategies should slow the rate of viral escape from vaccine or naturally induced immunity. As long as vaccination provides some protection against escape variants, the corresponding reduction in prevalence and incidence should reduce the rate at which new variants are generated and the speed of adaptation. Because there is little evidence of efficient immune selection of SARS-CoV-2 during typical infections, these population-level effects are likely to dominate vaccine-induced evolution.","Cobey, Sarah; Larremore, Daniel B; Grad, Yonatan H; Lipsitch, Marc",Nat Rev Immunol,,570

On the basis of the authors' experience and recommendations from other institutions, a set of specific proposals for clinical trial reform are identified that can be implemented immediately by sponsors, regulators, and study sites. Improvements in clinical trial processes should include increased leverage of technology to facilitate remote trial activity and electronic documents, more efficient and effective communication of adverse event information, and better study design to optimize inclusion criteria, required research procedures, and data collection. The authors suggest that such reform will preserve patient safety and study integrity, address unnecessary and inefficient pre-pandemic constraints, improve access to clinical trials for patients, and speed improvements in cancer care.","Vogl, Dan T; Sallée, Vicki; Hendricks, Maria C; Redlinger Tabery, Colleen; Blair, Meghan L; Dahlmeier, Erica; Meagher, Emma A; Cohen, Roger B; Vonderheide, Robert H",Cancer,,570

COVID-19 has a multifaceted presentation. We are herein to report two cases of SARS-CoV-2 induced rhabdomyolysis with an initial presentation of weakness and elevated creatinine kinase (CK). Both patients had no respiratory symptoms, they only complained of generalized weakness and were found to have elevated CK. Routine chest X-ray showed bilateral infiltrates in both cases and subsequently reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 was positive. To the best of our knowledge, there was only one literature to date documented SARS-CoV-2 induced rhabdomyolysis as a late complication of COVID-19 patient. Our cases showed that elevated CK and rhabdomyolysis can be the sole initial presentation of patients with COVID-19 and total CK should be ordered in every patient on admission.","Chan, Kok Hoe; Farouji, Iyad; Abu Hanoud, Amany; Slim, Jihad",Am. j. emerg. med,,570

Methods: Data was extracted from a prospectively managed trauma registry at level-1 trauma center in India. We have compared the data in lockdown period with the same day’s number from the pre-lockdown period. Patients were categorized according to age, gender, injury cause, injury place, injury severity, and injury outcome to compare the statistical analysis between two periods. Results: Total emergency department (ED) trauma footfall decreased significantly by 73% during lockdown period. The injuries result increased significantly due to blunt forces. There was a significant decrease in the major injury of the patient’s percentage. The road traffic injuries (RTIs) in individuals were less than the reported falls number, which increased significantly during lockdown. The less number of patients significantly presented without receiving primary care. Majority of the patients had been transferred by using private cars, police vehicle, and two wheelers during lockdown;however, patients’ less number were transferred significantly by three wheelers as expected. The comparative analysis between quantitative data points shows significant differences in median Injury Severity Score (ISS) and length of stay during lockdown. Conclusion: This study highlighted that the preparedness should not focus solely on the response to treat infectious disease during health emergencies but also on ensuring access and provision of reasonable quality of care for non-infectious illnesses especially acute conditions like trauma.","Kaushik, G.; Sharma, A.; Bagaria, D.; Kumar, S.; Sagar, S.; Gupta, A.",Bulletin of Emergency and Trauma,,570

471581,The impact of faculty experience with emergency remote teaching: An interpretive phenomenological study,2021,"OBJECTIVE: Report simple reference structure fabrication and validate the precise localization of subdural micro- and standard electrodes in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in phantom experiments. APPROACH: Electrode contacts with diameters of 0.3 mm and 4 mm are localized in 1.5 T MRI using reference structures made of silicone and iron oxide nanoparticle doping. The precision of the localization procedure was assessed for several standard MRI sequences and implant orientations in phantom experiments and compared to common clinical localization procedures. MAIN RESULTS: A localization precision of 0.41±0.20 mm could be achieved for both electrode diameters compared to 1.46±0.69 mm that was achieved for 4 mm standard electrode contacts localized using a common clinical standard method. The new reference structures are intrinsically bio-compatible, and they can be detected with currently available feature detection software so that a clinical implementation of this technology should be feasible. SIGNIFICANCE: Neuropathologies are increasingly diagnosed and treated with subdural electrodes, where the exact localization of the electrode contacts with respect to the patient's cortical anatomy is a prerequisite for the procedure. Post-implantation electrode localization using MRI may be advantageous compared to the common alternative of CT-MRI image co-registration, as it avoids systematic localization errors associated with the co-registration itself, as well as brain shift and implant movement. Additionally, MRI provides superior soft tissue contrast for the identification of brain lesions without exposing the patient to ionizing radiation. Recent studies show that smaller electrodes and high-density electrode grids are ideal for clinical and research purposes, but the localization of these devices in MRI has not been demonstrated.","Erhardt, Johannes B; Lottner, Thomas; Pasluosta, Cristian; Gessner, Isabel; Mathur, Sanjay; Schuettler, Martin; Bock, Michael; Stieglitz, Thomas",J. neural eng,,570

Furthermore, estimating the prevalence of such infectious diseases and associated factors is key to assess the disease impact and design control programs. In this study, we identified a high herd-level seroprevalence of EBL in cattle from the semi-arid Paraíba state, Northeast Region of Brazil, using a planned cross-sectional survey. Herd-level and animal-level prevalence were estimated using a two-stage random sampling survey. In total, 2067 cows aged &#8805;24 months from 400 herds were sampled. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect specific antibodies directed to the bovine leukosis virus gp51 antigen in both individual and pooled sera. The herd-level and animal-level prevalence was 23.4 % (95 % CI = 19.2-28.1 %) and 10.8 % (95 % CI = 7.5 %-15.3 %), respectively. There were no significant clusters of positive herds (within a radius of 2 km). The factors associated with herd-level prevalence were the exclusive use of hand milking (prevalence ratio [PR] = 1.88), herd size (PR = 1.005), artificial insemination (PR = 2.03), purchase of animals in the previous year (PR = 1.87), and peri-urban farms (PR = 2.09). Prevention measures should be applied at the herd-level, particularly for farms located in peri-urban areas, focusing on good hygiene in hand milking, robust practices and standards for artificial insemination, and serological testing of animals prior to purchase.","Ramalho, Gisele Cândida; Silva, Maria Luana Cristiny Rodrigues; Falcão, Brunna Muniz Rodrigues; Limeira, Clécio Henrique; Nogueira, Denise Batista; Dos Santos, Amanda Martins; Martins, Camila Marinelli; Alves, Clebert José; Clementino, Inácio José; de Sousa Américo Batista Santos, Carolina; de Azevedo, Sérgio Santos",Prev Vet Med,,570

489885,"Challenges to online engineering education during the Covid-19 pandemic in Eastern Visayas, Philippines",2021,"The link between status and self-esteem remains theoretically and empirically controversial. To help clarify it, we proposed an integrated account of status and self-esteem, and tested several hypotheses derived from it. We distinguished between two types of status: socioeconomic status (SES; education, income, occupation) and sociometric status (SMS; respect, admiration, importance). We then examined how they related to one another and to self-esteem across five studies (N = 2,018). As hypothesized, in Studies 1-2 (cross-sectional), SES and SMS correlated positively with one another, and both correlated positively with self-esteem, yet SMS predicted self-esteem more strongly than SES did. Moreover, SMS mediated the link between SES and self-esteem, and this statistical model fit the data better than an alternative model where SMS and SES reversed roles. Studies 3-5 demonstrated causal links experimentally. In Study 3, manipulating SES to be higher (vs. lower) led to higher (vs. lower) SMS and state self-esteem, with SMS again statistically mediating the impact of SES on state self-esteem. In Study 4, manipulating SMS to be higher (vs. lower) led to higher (vs. lower) state self-esteem. Finally, in Study 5, manipulating SMS showed that it causally mediated the link between SES and state self-esteem. Our findings persisted across multiple measurement formats and after controlling for the Big Five personality traits. They point to SMS being a more powerful and proximate predictor of self-esteem than SES, thereby illuminating the link between status and self-esteem, and adding to a growing literature on the psychology of status.

METHODS: We examined anonymised clinical data of psychiatry presentations to the ED during the initial 8-week period of COVID-19 restrictions. Data from corresponding 8-week periods in 2018 and 2019 were also extracted for comparison. RESULTS: Psychiatry presentations to ED reduced by 21% during the COVID-19 restrictions, from 24/week to 19/week when compared with corresponding periods in 2018/2019 (Poisson's Rate Test estimate of difference -5.2/week, 95% CI 1.3-9.1, p = 0.012). Numbers attending for out-of-hours assessment remained unchanged (81 v. 80), but numbers seeking assessment during normal hours decreased (71 v. 114). We observed increased presentations from the <18 age group, but decreased presentations from the 18 to 29 age group (Pearson's Chi-Square 20.363, df = 6, p = 0.002). We recorded an increase in anxiety disorders during the initial COVID-19 restrictions (31 v. 23), and a reduction in alcohol disorders (28 v. 52). The proportion of presentations with suicidal ideation (SI) or self-harm as factors remained unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: Rates of emergency presentation with mental illness reduced during the initial COVID-19 restrictions. This may represent an unmet burden of mental health needs. Younger people may be experiencing greater distress and mental illness during the current crisis. More people sought help for anxiety disorders during the COVID-19 restrictions compared with corresponding data from 2018 and 2019.","McAndrew, Joseph; O039,; Leary, Julia; Cotter, David; Cannon, Mary; MacHale, Siobhan; Murphy, Kieran C; Barry, Helen",Ir J Psychol Med,,570
492554,Summaries,2020,"How may exposure risks to SARS-CoV-2 be assessed quantitatively? The material metabolism approach of Industrial Ecology can be applied to the mass flows of these virions by their numbers, as a key step in the analysis of the current pandemic. Several transmission routes of SARS-2 from emission by a person to exposure of another person have been modelled and quantified. Start is a COVID-19 illness progression model specifying rising emissions by an infected person: the human virion factory. The first route covers closed spaces, with an emission, concentration, and decay model quantifying exposure. A next set of routes covers person-to-person contacts mostly in open spaces, modelling the spatial distribution of exhales towards inhalation. These models also cover incidental exposures, like coughs and sneezes, and exposure through objects. Routes through animal contacts, excrements, and food, have not been quantified. Potential exposures differ by six orders of magnitude. Closed rooms, even with reasonably (VR 2) to good (VR 5) ventilation, constitute the major exposure risks. Close person-to-person contacts of longer duration create two orders of magnitude lower exposure risks. Open spaces may create risks an order of magnitude lower again. Burst of larger droplets may cause a common cold but not viral pneumonia as the virions in such droplets cannot reach the alveoli. Fomites have not shown viable viruses in hospitals, let alone infections. Infection by animals might be possible, as by cats and ferrets kept as pets. These results indicate priority domains for individual and collective measures. The wide divergence in outcomes indicates robustness to most modelling and data improvements, hardly leading to major changes in relative exposure potentials. However, models and data can substantially be improved.","Huppes, Gjalt; Huele, Ruben",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.07826v2.pdf,570

The impact of COVID-19 on employees’ work attitudes and turnover intentions,2020,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, the scientific community developed predictive models to evaluate potential governmental interventions. However, the analysis of the effects these interventions had is less advanced. Here, we propose a data-driven framework to assess these effects retrospectively. We use a regularized regression to find a parsimonious model that fits the data with the least changes in the Rt parameter. Then, we postulate each jump in Rt as the effect of an intervention. Following the do-operator prescriptions, we simulate the counterfactual case by forcing Rt to stay at the pre-jump value. We then attribute a value to the intervention from the difference between true evolution and simulated counterfactual. We show that the recommendation to use facemasks for all activities would reduce the number of cases by 170000 (95% CI 160000 to 180000) in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New York State. The framework presented here might be used in any case where cause and effects are sparse in time.","Babino, Andres; Magnasco, Marcelo O.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.05532v2.pdf,570

495325,UGANDA: Strict Covid-19 Measures,2020,"BACKGROUND: ARDS in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is characterized by typical microcirculatory alterations in the pulmonary vascular bed, which could increase dead-space ventilation more than in non-COVID-19 ARDS. We aimed to establish if dead-space ventilation is different in patients with COVID-19 ARDS when compared with patients with non-COVID-19 ARDS. METHODS: A total of 187 subjects with COVID-19 ARDS and 178 subjects with non-COVID-19 ARDS who were undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation were included in the study. The association between the ARDS types and dead-space ventilation, compliance of the respiratory system, subjects' characteristics, organ failures, and mechanical ventilation was evaluated by using data collected in the first 24 h of mechanical ventilation. RESULTS: Corrected minute ventilation (VÌE), a dead-space ventilation surrogate, was higher in the subjects with COVID-19 ARDS versus in those with non-COVID-19 ARDS (median [interquartile range] 12.6 [10.2-15.8] L/min vs 9.4 [7.5-11.6] L/min; P < .001). Increased corrected VÌE was independently associated with COVID-19 ARDS (odds ratio 1.24, 95% CI 1.07-1.47; P = .007). The best compliance of the respiratory system, obtained after testing different PEEPs, was similar between the subjects with COVID-19 ARDS and the subjects with non-COVID-19 ARDS (mean ± SD 38 ± 11 mL/cm H2O vs 37 ± 11 mL/cm H2O, respectively; P = .61). The subjects with COVID-19 ARDS received higher median (interquartile range) PEEP (12 [10-14] cm H2O vs 8 [5-9] cm H2O; P < .001) and lower median (interquartile range) tidal volume (5.8 [5.5-6.3] mL/kg vs 6.6 [6.1-7.3] mL/kg; P < .001) than the subjects with non-COVID-19 ARDS, being these differences maintained at multivariable analysis. In the multivariable analysis, the subjects with COVID-19 ARDS showed a lower risk of anamnestic arterial hypertension (odds ratio 0.18, 95% CI 0.07-0.45; P < .001) and lower neurologic sequential organ failure assessment score (odds ratio 0.16, 95% CI 0.09-0.27; P < .001) than the subjects with non-COVID-19 ARDS. CONCLUSIONS: Indirect measurements of dead space were higher in subjects with COVID-19 ARDS compared with subjects with non-COVID-19 ARDS. The best compliance of the respiratory system was similar in both ARDS forms provided that different PEEPs were applied. A wide range of compliance is present in every ARDS type; therefore, the setting of mechanical ventilation should be individualized patient by patient and not based on the etiology of ARDS.","Bertelli, Michele; Fusina, Federica; Prezioso, Chiara; Cavallo, Erika; Nencini, Niccolò; Crisci, Serena; Tansini, Francesca; Mari, Letizia Mazzuca; Hoxha, Laureta; Lombardi, Fabiana; Natalini, Giuseppe",Respir. care,,570

495715,How is the COVID-19 pandemic shaping transportation access to health care?,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated ""going remote"" with the delivery, support, and assessment of a study intervention targeting older adults enrolled in a clinical trial. While remotely delivering and assessing technology is not new, there are few methods available in the literature that are proven to be effective with diverse populations, and none for older adults specifically. Older adults comprise a diverse population, including in terms of their experience with and access to technology, making this a challenging endeavor. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to remotely deliver and conduct usability testing for a mobile health (mHealth) technology intervention for older adult participants enrolled in a clinical trial of the technology. This paper describes the methodology used, its successes, and its limitations. METHODS: We developed a conceptual model for remote operations, called the Framework for Agile and Remote Operations (FAR Ops), that combined the general requirements for spaceflight operations with Agile project management processes to quickly respond to this challenge. Using this framework, we iteratively created care packages that differed in their contents based on participant needs and were sent to study participants to deliver the study intervention-a medication management app-and assess its usability. Usability data were collected using the System Usability Scale (SUS) and a novel usability questionnaire developed to collect more in-depth data. RESULTS: In the first 6 months of the project, we successfully delivered 21 care packages. We successfully designed and deployed a minimum viable product in less than 6 weeks, generally maintained a 2-week sprint cycle, and achieved a 40% to 50% return rate for both usability assessment instruments. We hypothesize that lack of engagement due to the pandemic and our use of asynchronous communication channels contributed to the return rate of usability assessments being lower than desired. We also provide general recommendations for performing remote usability testing with diverse populations based on the results of our work, including implementing screen sharing capabilities when possible, and determining participant preference for phone or email communications. CONCLUSIONS: The FAR Ops model allowed our team to adopt remote operations for our mHealth trial in response to interruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic. This approach can be useful for other research or practice-based projects under similar circumstances or to improve efficiency, cost, effectiveness, and participant diversity in general. In addition to offering a replicable approach, this paper tells the often-untold story of practical challenges faced by mHealth projects and practical strategies used to address them.

Our study describes the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with severe COVID-19 admitted to ICU in the largest health care system in the state of Florida, United States. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of patients admitted to ICU due to severe COVID-19 in AdventHealth health system in Orlando, Florida from March 11th until May 18th, 2020. Patients were characterized based on demographics, baseline comorbidities, severity of illness, medical management including experimental therapies, laboratory markers and ventilator parameters. Major clinical outcomes analyzed at the end of the study period were: hospital and ICU length of stay, MV-related mortality and overall hospital mortality of ICU patients. RESULTS: Out of total of 1283 patients with COVID-19, 131 (10.2%) met criteria for ICU admission (median age: 61 years [interquartile range (IQR), 49.5-71.5]; 35.1% female). Common comorbidities were hypertension (84; 64.1%), and diabetes (54; 41.2%). Of the 131 ICU patients, 109 (83.2%) required MV and 9 (6.9%) received ECMO. Lower positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) were observed in survivors [9.2 (7.7-10.4)] vs non-survivors [10 (9.1-12.9] p = 0.004]. Compared to non-survivors, survivors had a longer MV length of stay (LOS) [14 (IQR 8-22) vs 8.5 (IQR 5-10.8) p< 0.001], Hospital LOS [21 (IQR 13-31) vs 10 (7-1) p< 0.001] and ICU LOS [14 (IQR 7-24) vs 9.5 (IQR 6-11), p < 0.001]. The overall hospital mortality and MV-related mortality were 19.8% and 23.8% respectively. After exclusion of hospitalized patients, the hospital and MV-related mortality rates were 21.6% and 26.5% respectively.

508226,Serum Phosphate and Mortality in Incident Dialysis Patients in Australia and New Zealand,2021,"BACKGROUND: There is growing concern that racial and ethnic minority communities around the world are experiencing a disproportionate burden of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We investigated racial and ethnic disparities in patterns of COVID-19 testing (i.e., who received testing and who tested positive) and subsequent mortality in the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This retrospective cohort study included 5,834,543 individuals receiving care in the US Department of Veterans Affairs; most (91%) were men, 74% were non-Hispanic White (White), 19% were non-Hispanic Black (Black), and 7% were Hispanic. We evaluated associations between race/ethnicity and receipt of COVID-19 testing, a positive test result, and 30-day mortality, with multivariable adjustment for a wide range of demographic and clinical characteristics including comorbid conditions, health behaviors, medication history, site of care, and urban versus rural residence. Between February 8 and July 22, 2020, 254,595 individuals were tested for COVID-19, of whom 16,317 tested positive and 1,057 died. Black individuals were more likely to be tested (rate per 1,000 individuals: 60.0, 95% CI 59.6-60.5) than Hispanic (52.7, 95% CI 52.1-53.4) and White individuals (38.6, 95% CI 38.4-38.7). While individuals from minority backgrounds were more likely to test positive (Black versus White: odds ratio [OR] 1.93, 95% CI 1.85-2.01, p < 0.001; Hispanic versus White: OR 1.84, 95% CI 1.74-1.94, p < 0.001), 30-day mortality did not differ by race/ethnicity (Black versus White: OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.80-1.17, p = 0.74; Hispanic versus White: OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.73-1.34, p = 0.94). The disparity between Black and White individuals in testing positive for COVID-19 was stronger in the Midwest (OR 2.66, 95% CI 2.41-2.95, p < 0.001) than the West (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.11-1.39, p < 0.001). The disparity in testing positive for COVID-19 between Hispanic and White individuals was consistent across region, calendar time, and outbreak pattern. Study limitations include underrepresentation of women and a lack of detailed information on social determinants of health. CONCLUSIONS: In this nationwide study, we found that Black and Hispanic individuals are experiencing an excess burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection not entirely explained by underlying medical conditions or where they live or receive care. There is an urgent need to proactively tailor strategies to contain and prevent further outbreaks in racial and ethnic minority communities.","Rentsch, Christopher T; Kidwai-Khan, Farah; Tate, Janet P; Park, Lesley S; King, Joseph T; Skanderson, Melissa; Hauser, Ronald G; Schultze, Anna; Jarvis, Christopher I; Holodniy, Mark; Lo Re, Vincent; Akgün, Kathleen M; Crothers, Kristina; Taddei, Tamar H; Freiberg, Matthew S; Justice, Amy C",PLoS Med,,570

We focused our research attention on frequency and purposes of Internet visits by students while learning remotely. The paper provides findings obtained through two waves of the sociological survey carried out in Moscow in 2019 and 2020. Using a questionnaire method we surveyed students of Moscow universities in March 2019 (N=1240 respondents) and in April 2020 (N=410). We fixed growth in the use of desktop computers by student users. We found that the number of Internet visits for communication purposes remained almost the same as it had been before the pandemic. Remarkably, the number of work related requests increased significantly, while the growth in searches for learning resources was not as impressive as we had expected in view of the overall shift to distance learning. Thus, we concluded that the e-learning shift did not cause significant transformations of the higher education system. © 2020 Copyright for this paper by its authors.","Kargapolova, Y.; Davydova, Y.; Denisenkova, N.; Akimova, N.","2020 International Scientific Conference on Innovative Approaches to the Application of Digital Technologies in Education, SLET 2020",,570
509650,Moving from emergency remote teaching to digital education in times of pandemic,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has substantially impacted the conduct of clinical trials. While initially preparing for a period of time, where it would likely be impossible to supervise trials in the usual way and precautionary measures had to be implemented to care for medication supply and general safety of study participants it is now important to consider, how the impact of the pandemic on trial outcome can be assessed, which measures are needed to decide, how to proceed with the trial and what is needed to compensate to irregularity introduced by the pandemic situation. Obviously not all trials will suffer to the same degree: some trials may be close to finalizing recruitment, others may not yet have started. Similarly not all clinical trials investigate vulnerable patient populations, but some will and may in addition have recruited to an extent that beneficial effects achieved in the initial phase of the trial may be outweighed by an increase e.g. in mortality that impacts both treatment groups. The situation is further complicated by the fact that the pandemic reached different countries in the world and even cities in one country at different points in time with different severity. Our example is a randomized and double-blind clinical trial comparing digitoxin and placebo in patients with advanced chronic heart failure. This trial has recruited roughly 1/3 of the overall 2200 patients when the disease outbreak reached Germany. We discuss how simulations and theoretical considerations can be used to address questions about the need to increase the overall sample-size to be recruited to compensate for a potential shrinkage of the treatment effect caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and what role the degree of consistency could play when comparing pre-, during- and post- COVID-19 periods of trial conduct regarding the question, whether the treatment effect can be considered consistent and with this generalizable. This is dependent on the size of the treatment effect and the impact of the pandemic. We argue, that in case of doubt, it may be wise to proceed with the original study plan.","Großhennig, Anika; Koch, Armin",Contemp Clin Trials,,570

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was used to analyze the case data of 200 inpatients diagnosed with common-type COVID-19 at Wuhan Hospital. Participants were divided into a control group and an experimental group. The control group was treated with Arbidol hydrochloride capsules while the experimental group was treated with combination Arbidol hydrochloride capsules and Shufeng Jiedu Capsules (SFJDC) for 14 days. RESULTS: Defervescence was achieved more rapidly in the experimental group (P < 0.05). The white blood cell count and the lymphocyte percentage in the experimental group were higher than that of the control group (P < 0.05). CRP and IL-6 levels in the experimental group were significantly lower than those in the control group (P < 0.05). The proportion of chest CT studies showing resolution of pneumonia in the experimental group was significantly higher than that in the control group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A treatment regimen of Shufeng Jiedu Capsules combined with Arbidol to treat common-type COVID-19, combining traditional Chinese and western allopathic medicine, improves time to recovery, has better clinical effectiveness, and is safe.","Chen, Jing; Lin, Shaowu; Niu, Conway; Xiao, Qi",Expert Rev Respir Med,,570

This report describes the person-to-person transmission of the virus in a hospital setting. Presentation of case: A 63-year-old man with pneumonia and a 70-year-old man without symptoms were admitted to a tertiary hospital with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Both men were accompanied by their wives, who stayed with their husbands during their hospitalisation. The wives of Patient 1 and Patient 2 tested positive and negative for SARS-CoV-2, respectively. Of the environmental samples tested, 1/21 and 0/25 from the rooms of Patient 1 and Patient 2, respectively, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Patient 1’s wife appeared to have acquired infection during her husband's hospitalisation. Discussion: The study had several limitations, including methodology inconsistencies. Additionally, a viral culture was not performed to demonstrate the viability of the virus identified in the environmental sample. Finally, the wife of Patient 1 stayed on the Diamond Princess cruise ship for 4 days before being transferred to the hospital and may have been infected on the ship and not while in the hospital. Conclusion: Our study suggests that airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 may be limited. However, owing to the abovementioned limitations, the results should be interpreted with caution.","Morioka, Shinichiro; Nakamura, Keiji; Iida, Shun; Kutsuna, Satoshi; Kinoshita, Noriko; Suzuki, Tetsuya; Suzuki, Tadaki; Yamamoto, Kei; Hayakawa, Kayoko; Saito, Sho; Ohmagari, Norio",Infect.

511953,[Reply]./ Respuesta,2021,"PURPOSE: The adrenal gland is a common site of metastasis in patients with advanced cancer, but it is rarely symptomatic. A subset of patients develop a complex pain syndrome with anorexia, nausea, and poorly localized visceral pain in the back, flank, or epigastric region. These symptoms can impact quality of life and are occasionally challenging to palliate. The role of palliative radiotherapy (PRT) in these patients is unclear. This population-based retrospective study evaluates PRT practices for patients with adrenal metastases and aims to describe treatment response and acute toxicity. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients who received PRT to an adrenal metastasis between the years of 1985 and 2015 were identified in a XXX database. Patient demographics, tumor factors, symptom burden, radiotherapy prescriptions and response to treatment were collected. Variables were summarized using descriptive statistics. Kaplan-Meier was used to assess survival. Factors associated with clinical response were evaluated using univariate and logistic regression analysis. Factors associated with survival were evaluated using univariate and Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: One hundred patients who received 103 separate courses of PRT were identified. The majority had a lung primary (82%). The most common baseline symptoms were pain (90%) and gastrointestinal upset (13%). Prescriptions ranged from 600 cGy in a single fraction to 4500 cGy in 25 fractions. Seventy percent of patients experienced an improvement in pain (either a complete or partial response). Forty-three percent of patients developed acute toxicity from treatment. Median survival was 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to other anatomic sites, conventional PRT is uncommonly delivered to adrenal metastases. Despite heterogeneity in tumor histology and radiotherapy prescriptions, treatment was associated with an overall pain response of 70%. Prophylactic anti-emetics to decrease radiation induced nausea are required prior to treatment. Given the poor prognosis of this population, short fractionations are indicated.","Parhar, Ravi; Livergant, Jonathan; Lefresne, Shilo",Int. j. radiat. oncol. biol. phys,,570

However, since the dental services cannot be stopped for a long period it is important that dentist be fully prepared before resuming their services. Therefore, the current study was carried out for evaluating knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP) along with perceived barriers to practice dentistry during pandemic. Methods: this cross-sectional study was conducted through an online survey questionnaire on dentists of India. Dentists were enquired for demographics, KAP and perceived barriers regarding practicing dentistry during pandemic. The knowledge was assessed based on 16 items in true or false or multiple choice questions format getting score of 1 or 0. The attitude and practices by 8 items each, on 5-point Likert scale and 4 items perceived barriers were enquired. The differences between the median scores among demographic variables were determined by applying student's t-test and keeping level of significance at below 0.05. Results: out of 500 dentists who were approached through email, a total of 296 dentists returned the questionnaire (response rate, 59.2%) among which 22 questionnaires were incomplete and thus excluded making 274 as final study participants. Overall poor median scores of knowledge and practices were obtained whereas for attitude total median score was good. Median practice scores were significantly higher among female respondents (20(6)). Median knowledge and practice scores were significantly better in study participants with age <40 years (6(4) and 19(5), respectively). Conclusion: with the recent claims of authorities that virus is going to stay in world for quite some time it is essential that dentists must be fully prepared before resuming their services and must attain proper awareness to limit the disease spread.","Singh, Kumar Tathagat; Mishra, Gaurav; Shukla, Alok Kumar; Behera, Subasish; Tiwari, Arun Kumar; Panigrahi, Subhasish; Chhabra, Kumar Gaurav",Pan Afr Med J,,570

DATA SOURCES: We performed a systematic search of the available literature using PubMed, MEDLINE (Ovid), and Web of Science, combining key terms regarding recent infectious disease outbreaks and psychological and coping responses. Papers published from database inception to April 20, 2020, were considered for inclusion. Only studies in the English language and papers from peer-reviewed journals were included. STUDY SELECTION: We identified 95 (PubMed) and 49 papers (Web of Science) from the database search, of which 23 papers were eventually included in the review. DATA EXTRACTION: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were used for data extraction. The McMaster University critical appraisal tool was used to appraise quantitative studies. Guidelines by Higginbotham and colleagues were used to appraise qualitative studies. Only studies exploring the combined psychological and coping responses of HCW amid infectious diseases were included. RESULTS: Salient psychological responses that can persist beyond the outbreaks included anxiety/fears, stigmatization, depression, posttraumatic stress, anger/frustration, grief, and burnout, but also positive growth and transformation. Personal coping methods (such as problem solving, seeking social support, and positive thinking) alongside workplace measures (including infection control and safety, staff support and recognition, and clear communication) were reported to be helpful. CONCLUSIONS: Psychological support for HCW in the current COVID-19 pandemic and future outbreaks should focus on both individual (eg, psychoeducation on possible psychological responses, self-care) and institutional (eg, clear communication, providing access to resources for help, recognition of efforts of HCW) measures.","Chew, Qian Hui; Wei, Ker Chiah; Vasoo, Shawn; Sim, Kang",J. clin. psychiatr,,570

SARS-CoV-2 transmission on different levels showed that the cold and dry climate, hot wind and relative humid wind, maximum wind speed, turbulent wind, intensified recirculating flow were causing transmission higher than factors. The role of environmental factors described in Ayurveda like air, water, soil, season, frequent earthquakes, sunlight exposure, frequent thunderstorm with lightening, and factors from arthropods were revalidated in perspective of COVID-19 transmission. The authors searched the information regarding epidemic diseases in Ayurveda textbooks. Pubmed, Science Direct, Wikipedia, Elsevier, Lancet, and Springer were approached for the latest knowledge relating to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. Google Scholar search engine was thoroughly checked upon for scientific evidence regarding the Ayurveda drugs. Various environmental factors like soil, air, water, frequent earthquake disasters, wildlife animals, aquatic birds, space, inevitable disastrous factors, weather or seasonal hazards, violent thunderstorm with lightning, intermediate hosts, sunlight exposure etc. were considered for their role in the genesis of the disease. The Ayurvedic concepts behind the etiology and development of epidemics are the same as modern epidemiological theories.

This study examined this association in an evaluation of home-quarantined university students during the 2019/2020 COVID-19 pandemic in China. Methods: In total, 2501 home-quarantined students from six southwest Chinese universities completed the following questionnaires: the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL[sbnd]C), and the Patients Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), after which structural equation modeling (SEM) and mediation analyses were employed to extract and evaluate the possible associations. Results: It was found that participants with probable depression or PTSD also reported more severe alexithymia features, such as difficulties in identifying feelings (DIF) or describing feelings (DDF). Alexithymia was also found to partially mediate the effect of number of exposures on mental health problems. Conclusion: These results suggested that implementing strategies to assist young people identify and deal with their own emotions and those of others could prevent or mitigate the mental health problems associated with deadly pandemic events. However, future longitudinal studies are needed to examine the specific involvement of DIF or DDF in people with mental health problems.","Tang, Wanjie; Hu, Tao; Yang, Le; Xu, Jiuping",Pers. Individ.

The social network of a patient is a critical yet understudied factor in the success of TR that may influence both engagement in therapy programs and post-stroke outcomes. We designed a 12-week home-based TR program for stroke patients and evaluated which social factors might be related to motor gains and reduced depressive symptoms. Methods: Stroke patients (n = 13) with arm motor deficits underwent supervised home-based TR for 12 weeks with routine assessments of motor function and mood. At the 6-week midpoint, we mapped each patient's personal social network and evaluated relationships between social network metrics and functional improvements from TR. Finally, we compared social networks of TR patients with a historical cohort of 176 stroke patients who did not receive any TR to identify social network differences. Results: Both network size and network density were related to walk time improvement (p = 0.025; p = 0.003). Social network density was related to arm motor gains (p = 0.003). Social network size was related to reduced depressive symptoms (p = 0.015). TR patient networks were larger (p = 0.012) and less dense (p = 0.046) than historical stroke control networks. Conclusions: Social network structure is positively related to improvement in motor status and mood from TR. TR patients had larger and more open social networks than stroke patients who did not receive TR. Understanding how social networks intersect with TR outcomes is crucial to maximize effects of virtual rehabilitation.","Podury, Archana; Raefsky, Sophia M.; Dodakian, Lucy; McCafferty, Liam; Le, Vu; McKenzie, Alison; See, Jill; Zhou, Robert J.; Nguyen, Thalia; Vanderschelden, Benjamin; Wong, Gene; Nazarzai, Laila; Heckhausen, Jutta; Cramer, Steven C.; Dhand, Amar",Front Neurol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2021.603767; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33603709/,570

This study sought to investigate the association between mental health (eg, anxiety and depressive symptoms) and sleep health among a sample of Jordanians living through a state of COVID-19-induced nationwide lockdown. METHODS: Using Facebook, participants (n=1240) in Jordan in March 2020 were recruited and direct to a web-based survey measuring anxiety (items from General Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale instrument), depressive symptoms (items from Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale), sleep health (items from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) and sociodemographic. A modified Poisson regression model with robust error variance. Adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) and 95% CIs were estimated to examine how anxiety and depressive symptoms may affect different dimensions of sleep health: (1) poor sleep quality, (2) short sleep duration, (3) encountering sleep problems. RESULTS: The majority of participants reported having experienced mild (33.8%), moderate (12.9%) or severe (6.3%) levels of anxiety during lockdown, and nearly half of respondents reported depressive symptoms during lockdown. Similarly, over 60% of participants reported having experienced at least one sleep problem in the last week, and nearly half reported having had short sleep duration. Importantly, anxiety was associated with poor sleep health outcomes. For example, corresponding to the dose–response relationship between anxiety and sleep health outcomes, those reporting severe anxiety were the most likely to experience poor sleep quality (aPR =8.95; 95% CI=6.12 to 13.08), short sleep duration (aPR =2.23; 95% CI=1.91 to 2.61) and at least one problem sleep problem (aPR=1.73; 95% CI=1.54 to 1.95). Moreover, depressive symptoms were also associated with poor sleep health outcomes. As compared with scoring in the first quartile, scoring fourth quartile was associated with poor sleep quality (aPR=11.82; 95% CI=6.64 to 21.04), short sleep duration (aPR=1.87; 95% CI=1.58 to 2.22), and experiencing at least one sleep problem (aPR=1.90; 95% CI=1.66 to 2.18). CONCLUSIONS: Increased levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms can negatively influence sleep health among a sample of Jordanian adults living in a state of COVID-19-induced nationwide lockdown.","Al-Ajlouni, Yazan A; Park, Su Hyun; Alawa, Jude; Shamaileh, Ghaith; Bawab, Aziz; El-Sadr, Wafaa M; Duncan, Dustin T",BMJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33371040/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-041995,570

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to describe a research protocol to investigate the effect of a newly developed iCBT stress management program adopting AI technologies on improving depression among healthy workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This study is a two-arm, parallel, randomized controlled trial. Participants (N=1400) will be recruited, and those who meet the inclusion criteria will be randomly allocated to the intervention or control (treatment as usual) group. A 6-week, six-module, internet-based stress management program, SMART-CBT, has been developed that includes machine-guided exercises to help participants acquire CBT skills, and it applies machine learning and deep learning technologies. The intervention group will participate in the program for 10 weeks. The primary outcome, depression, will be measured using the Beck Depression Inventory II at baseline and 3- and 6-month follow-ups. A mixed model repeated measures analysis will be used to test the intervention effect (group × time interactions) in the total sample (universal prevention) on an intention-to-treat basis. RESULTS: The study was at the stage of recruitment of participants at the time of submission. The data analysis related to the primary outcome will start in January 2022, and the results might be published in 2022 or 2023. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to investigate the effectiveness of a fully automated machine-guided iCBT program for improving subthreshold depression among workers using a randomized controlled trial design. The study will explore the potential of a machine-guided stress management program that can be disseminated online to a large number of workers with minimal cost in the post-COVID-19 era.

Pandemic related workload and level of experience on covid‐dedicated chest CT scans might have affected the diagnostic performance of on‐call radiologists. The aim of this study was to reveal the interpretation errors (IEs) in chest CT reports of COVID‐19–suspected patients admitted to the Emergency Room (ER). METHODS: Chest CT scans between March and June 2020 were re‐evaluated and compared with the former reports and PCR test results. CT scan results were classified into four groups. Parenchymal involvement ratios, radiology departments’ workload, COVID‐19–related educational activities have been examined. RESULTS: Out of 5721 Chest CT scans, 783 CTs belonging to 664 patients (340 female, 324 male) were included in this study. PCR test was positive in 398; negative in 385 cases. PCR positivity was found to be highest in “normal” and “typical for covid” groups whereas lowest in “atypical for covid” and “not covid” groups. 5%‐25% parenchymal involvement ratio was found in 84.2% of the cases. Regarding the number of chest CT scans performed, radiologists’ workload has found to be increased six‐folds. With the re‐evaluation, a total of 145 IEs (18.5%) have been found. IEs were mostly precipitated in the first two months (88.3%) and mostly in the “not covid” class (60%) regardless of PCR positivity. COVID‐19 and radiology entitled educational activities along with the ER admission rates within the first two months of the pandemic have seemed to be related to the decline of IEs within time. CONCLUSION: COVID‐19 pandemic made a great impact on radiology departments with an inevitable burden of daily chest CT reporting.

Public and private decision-making surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic must contend with uncertainty about the probability of infection during activities involving groups of people, in order to decide whether that activity is worth undertaking. We propose a deterministic linear model of SARS-CoV-2 infection probability that can produce estimates of relative risk for diverse activities, so long as those activities meet a list of assumptions, including that they do not last longer than one day. We show how the model can be used to inform decisions facing governments and industry, such as opening stadiums or flying on airplanes. We prove that the model is a good approximation of a more refined model in which we assume infections come from a series of independent risks. The linearity assumption makes interpreting and using the model straightforward, and we argue that it does so without significantly diminishing the reliability of the model.","McCarthy, John E.; Dumas, Bob A.; McCarthy, Myles T.; Dewitt, Barry D.",medRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32869042/; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.23.20180349v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.23.20180349,570

Although SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus, most humans had been previously exposed to other antigenically distinct common seasonal human coronaviruses (hCoVs) before the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we quantified levels of SARS-CoV-2-reactive antibodies and hCoV-reactive antibodies in serum samples collected from 204 humans before the COVID-19 pandemic. We then quantified pre-pandemic antibody levels in serum from a separate cohort of 252 individuals who became PCR-confirmed infected with SARS-CoV-2. Finally, we longitudinally measured hCoV and SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the serum of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Our studies indicate that most individuals possessed hCoV-reactive antibodies before the COVID-19 pandemic. We determined that ~23% of these individuals possessed non-neutralizing antibodies that cross-reacted with SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins. These antibodies were not associated with protection against SARS-CoV-2 infections or hospitalizations, but paradoxically these hCoV cross-reactive antibodies were boosted upon SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Anderson, Elizabeth M.; Goodwin, Eileen C.; Verma, Anurag; Arevalo, Claudia P.; Bolton, Marcus J.; Weirick, Madison E.; Gouma, Sigrid; McAllister, Christopher M.; Christensen, Shannon R.; Weaver, JoEllen; Hicks, Phillip; Manzoni, Tomaz B.; Oniyide, Oluwatosin; Ramage, Holly; Mathew, Divij; Baxter, Amy E.; Oldridge, Derek A.; Greenplate, Allison R.; Wu, Jennifer E.; Alanio, Cécile; D’Andrea, Kurt; Kuthuru, Oliva; Dougherty, Jeanette; Pattekar, Ajinkya; Kim, Justin; Han, Nicholas; Apostolidis, Sokratis A.; Huang, Alex C.; Vella, Laura A.; Wherry, E.

To ensure successful implementation of the proposed framework, point-of-care (POC) immunodiagnostic testing is needed to quickly ramp up the testing capability. Considerations for deploying POC immunodiagnostic testing at such a large scale are discussed.

625341,Comment on “Poorly known aspects of flattening the curve of COVID-19”,2021-02-16,"BACKGROUND: Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) constitutes the most common types of oral cancer. Because its prognosis varies significantly, identification of a tumor immune microenvironment could be a critical tool for treatment planning and predicting a more accurate prognosis. This study is aimed at utilizing the Hyperion imaging system to depict a preliminary landscape of the tumor immune microenvironment in OSCC with lymph node metastasis. METHODS: We collected neoplasm samples from OSCC patients. Their formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections were obtained and stained utilizing a panel of 26 clinically relevant metal-conjugated antibodies. Detection and analysis were performed for these stained cells with the Hyperion imaging system. RESULTS: Four patients met our inclusion criteria. We depicted a preliminary landscape of their tumor immune microenvironment and identified 25 distinct immune cell subsets from these OSCC patients based on phenotypic similarity. All these patients had decreased expression of CD8(+) T cells in tumor specimens. Variety in cell subsets was seen, and more immune activated cells were found in patient A and patient B than those in patient C and patient D. Such differences in tumor immune microenvironments can contribute to forecasting of individual prognoses. CONCLUSION: The Hyperion imaging system helped to delineate a preliminary and multidimensional landscape of the tumor immune microenvironment in OSCC with lymph node metastasis and provided insights into the influence of the immune microenvironment in determination of prognoses. These results reveal possible contributory factors behind different prognoses of OSCC patients with lymph node metastasis and provide reference for individual treatment planning.","Xie, Shang; Zhang, Xin-Yuan; Shan, Xiao-Feng; Yau, Vicky; Zhang, Jian-Yun; Wang, Wei; Yan, Yong-Pan; Cai, Zhi-Gang",J Immunol Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34239944/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/9975423,570
631084,Demographic Dividend in the Age of Neoliberal Capitalism: An Analysis of Employment and Employability in India,2021-08-24,"The recent COVID-19 pandemic has sparked a global public health crisis. Vital to the development of informed treatments for this disease is a comprehensive understanding of the molecular interactions involved in disease pathology. One lens through which we can better understand this pathology is through the network of protein-protein interactions between its viral agent, SARS-CoV-2, and its human host. For instance, increased infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV can be explained by rapid evolution along the interface between the Spike protein and its human receptor (ACE2) leading to increased binding affinity. Sequence divergences that modulate other protein-protein interactions may further explain differences in transmission and virulence in this novel coronavirus. To facilitate these comparisons, we combined homology-based structural modeling with the ECLAIR pipeline for interface prediction at residue resolution, and molecular docking with PyRosetta. This enabled us to compile a novel 3D structural interactome meta-analysis for the published interactome network between SARS-CoV-2 and human. This resource includes docked structures for all interactions with protein structures, enrichment analysis of variation along interfaces, predicted ΔΔG between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 variants for each interaction, predicted impact of natural human population variation on binding affinity, and a further prioritized set of drug repurposing candidates predicted to overlap with protein interfaces†.

However, there is a paucity of evidence regarding this association. In the field of low back pain research, inconsistent reporting of outcomes has been highlighted. To address this issue a Core Outcome Set has been developed. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this scoping review were: (1) The health literacy measures currently employed for low back pain and the aspects of health literacy they include. (2) The low back pain health outcomes included in such work. (3) The extent to which these health outcomes reflect the Core Outcome Set for Clinical Trials in Non-Specific Low Back Pain. METHODS: The search included thirteen bibliographic databases, using medical subject heading terms for low back pain and health literacy, and followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines. The eligibility criteria were defined by the Joanna Briggs Institute PCC mnemonic. A thematic framework approach was used for analysis. RESULTS: The search yielded ten relevant studies for inclusion, amongst which a total of nine health literacy measures and 50 health outcome measures were used. Most health literacy measures focused on functional health literacy, with few assessing communicative and critical health literacy. The health outcomes assessed by the included studies could be broadly categorised into: Pain, Disability, Behaviour, Knowledge and Beliefs, and Resource Utilisation. Most of these outcome measures studied (36 out of 50) did not directly reflect the Core Outcome Set for Clinical Trials in Non-Specific Low Back Pain. CONCLUSIONS: To allow for comparison across findings and the development of a rigorous evidence base, future work should include the Core Outcome Set for Clinical Trials in Non-Specific Low Back Pain. There is an urgent need to broaden the evidence-base to include regions where low back pain morbidity is high, but data is lacking. Such work demands the incorporation of comprehensive measures of health literacy that have both generic and culturally sensitive components.","See, Ye King Clarence; Smith, Helen Elizabeth; Car, Lorainne Tudor; Protheroe, Joanne; Wong, Wei Cong; Bartlam, Bernadette",BMC Med Inform Decis Mak,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12911-021-01572-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34256742/,570

As such, how educators respond to the contemporary situation is not without consequence. Inspired by the writings of Giorgio Agamben, this article argues that, while the way forward is not unambiguous, the Covid-19 situation offers educators an unanticipated opportunity to pause; to reconsider our aspirations; and, ultimately, to reclaim education as an ethico-political activity. To embrace this opportunity requires the interpretation of our current situation as a real state of exception in which the neoliberal order and its utopian-learning culture can be suspended. In a state of suspension, one can begin thinking afresh about the Covid-19 pandemic and what reactions to and conversations about the event reveal about (more desirable) ways of learning and living together in schools and society.","Phelan, Anne M.; Hansen, Dion Rüsselbæk",Prospects (Paris),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33612862/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11125-020-09536-4,570

Our study objective is to evaluate the electromyography and nerve conduction study (EMG/NCS) findings among COVID-19 patients and look for possible correlations. METHODS: This is a hospital-based retrospective observational study. All COVID-19 patients between the period of 1st January 2020 to 31st December 2020 undergoing an EMG/NCS were included. RESULTS: Eighteen patients (12 male and 6 female) were included. Mean age was 55 ±12 years. 11 patients required intubation for a mean period of 18.6 days (range: 3-37 days). Electrodiagnostic findings were consistent with a myopathy in a majority of these patients (82%). Five of them also had a concurrent axonal neuropathy. In the remaining patients who did not require intubation (n=7), three patients had myopathic EMG changes and one had Guillain Barre syndrome. CONCLUSION: At this time, there are no neuromuscular-specific recommendations for patients who contract COVID-19. Only time and additional data will unveil the varying nature and potential neurological sequelae of COVID-19. SIGNIFICANCE: Myopathic EMG changes are commonly seen in critically ill COVID-19 patients, especially with a prolonged hospital stay.

Moreover, the related factors of voluntary reduction of social interaction were examined. We recruited participants via a Facebook advertisement. We determined the reduced social interaction, perceived social support, cognitive and affective constructs of health belief and demographic characteristics among 1954 respondents (1305 women and 649 men; mean age: 37.9 years with standard deviation 10.8 years). In total, 38.1% of respondents voluntarily reduced their social interaction with friends to avoid COVID-19 infection, 36.1% voluntarily reduced their interaction with colleagues or classmates, and 11.1% voluntarily reduced interaction with family members. Respondents who voluntarily reduced interaction with other people reported lower perceived social support than those who did not voluntarily reduce interaction. Respondents who were older and had a higher level of worry regarding contracting COVID-19 were more likely to voluntarily reduce interaction with family members, friends, and colleagues or classmates to avoid COVID-19 infection than respondents who were younger and had a lower level of worry regarding contracting COVID-19, respectively. The present study revealed that despite strict social distancing measures not being implemented in Taiwan, more than one-third of respondents voluntarily reduced their interaction with friends and colleagues or classmates. The general public should be encouraged to maintain social contacts through appropriately distanced in-person visits and telecommunication.","Chou, Wei-Po; Wang, Peng-Wei; Chen, Shiou-Lan; Chang, Yu-Ping; Wu, Chia-Fen; Lu, Wei-Hsin; Yen, Cheng-Fang",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33142789/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17218039,570
655077,The Development of a Video Intervention to Improve Senior Medical Students’ Performance on Outpatient Telephone Encounters: a Delphi Analysis and Randomized Controlled Trial,2021-06-21,"BACKGROUND: There is growing concern about possible cognitive consequences of COVID-19, with reports of ‘Long COVID’ symptoms persisting into the chronic phase and case studies revealing neurological problems in severely affected patients. However, there is little information regarding the nature and broader prevalence of cognitive problems post-infection or across the full spread of disease severity. METHODS: We sought to confirm whether there was an association between cross-sectional cognitive performance data from 81,337 participants who between January and December 2020 undertook a clinically validated web-optimized assessment as part of the Great British Intelligence Test, and questionnaire items capturing self-report of suspected and confirmed COVID-19 infection and respiratory symptoms. FINDINGS: People who had recovered from COVID-19, including those no longer reporting symptoms, exhibited significant cognitive deficits versus controls when controlling for age, gender, education level, income, racial-ethnic group, pre-existing medical disorders, tiredness, depression and anxiety. The deficits were of substantial effect size for people who had been hospitalised (N = 192), but also for non-hospitalised cases who had biological confirmation of COVID-19 infection (N = 326). Analysing markers of premorbid intelligence did not support these differences being present prior to infection. Finer grained analysis of performance across sub-tests supported the hypothesis that COVID-19 has a multi-domain impact on human cognition. INTERPRETATION: Interpretation. These results accord with reports of ‘Long Covid’ cognitive symptoms that persist into the early-chronic phase. They should act as a clarion call for further research with longitudinal and neuroimaging cohorts to plot recovery trajectories and identify the biological basis of cognitive deficits in SARS-COV-2 survivors.

659235,Medical Students’ Perspectives on Online Proctoring During Remote Digital Progress Test,2021-09-30,"BACKGROUND: Micro-organisms transmitted from vertebrate animals – including livestock – to humans account for an estimated 60% of human pathogens. Micro-organisms can be transmitted through inhalation, ingestion, via conjunctiva or physical contact. Close contact with animals is crucial for transmission. The role of intensity and type of contact patterns between livestock and humans for disease transmission is poorly understood. In this systematic review we aimed to summarise current knowledge regarding patterns of human–livestock contacts and their role in micro-organism transmission. METHODS: We included peer-reviewed publications published between 1996 and 2014 in our systematic review if they reported on human–livestock contacts, human cases of livestock-related zoonotic diseases or serological epidemiology of zoonotic diseases in human samples. We extracted any information pertaining the type and intensity of human–livestock contacts and associated zoonoses. RESULTS: 1522 papers were identified, 75 were included: 7 reported on incidental zoonoses after brief animal–human contacts (e.g. farm visits), 10 on environmental exposures and 15 on zoonoses in developing countries where backyard livestock keeping is still customary. 43 studies reported zoonotic risks in different occupations. Occupations at risk included veterinarians, culling personnel, slaughterhouse workers and farmers. For culling personnel, more hours exposed to livestock resulted in more frequent occurrence of transmission. Slaughterhouse workers in contact with live animals were more often positive for zoonotic micro-organisms compared to co-workers only exposed to carcasses. Overall, little information was available about the actual mode of micro-organism transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Little is known about the intensity and type of contact patterns between livestock and humans that result in micro-organism transmission. Studies performed in occupational settings provide some, but limited evidence of exposure response-like relationships for livestock–human contact and micro-organism transmission. Better understanding of contact patterns driving micro-organism transmission from animals to humans is needed to provide options for prevention and thus deserves more attention.","Klous, Gijs; Huss, Anke; Heederik, Dick J.J.; Coutinho, Roel A.",One Health,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352771415300136; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.onehlt.2016.03.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28616478/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352771415300136,570

These might present with a wide range of symptoms from being completely asymptomatic to having life-threatening complications like stroke, heart failure, or even sudden death. This study summarizes our 6-year clinical experience with surgical resection of cardiac tumors at Chittagong Medical College and Hospital, Chattogram, Bangladesh. METHODS: Twenty patients who underwent surgical excision of primary intracardiac myxoma between February 2014 and February 2020 were included in the study. Seventeen (85%) of them were female and 3 (15%) were male. Mean age was 43.4 ± 14.1 years. The tumors were located in the left atrium in 19 patients and in 1 patient it was in the right atrium. The most common attachment site was the interatrial septum. Most of the patients presented with dyspnea. Preoperative diagnosis was established using transthoracic echocardiography with colour Doppler. Surgery for all patients was via median sternotomy. RESULTS: All 20 patients survived the surgery. Mean tumor dimension was 4.6 ± 3.5 cm in the longest diameter. Solid tumors were detected in 13 patients (65%) whereas papillary myxomas were found in 7 patients (35%). On follow-up of these 20 patients, there was no perioperative death. One patient presented with recurrence 28 months after the surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Although cardiac myxomas carry the risk of serious systemic and cardiac symptoms, prompt surgical excision gives excellent outcome.","Hosain, Nazmul; Quaium Chowdhury, Muhammad Abdul; Maruf, Mohammad Fazle; Chowdhury, Minhazur Rahman; Barua, Subir; Rahman, Mamunur",CJC Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33778452/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjco.2020.10.021,570

The results demonstrate that the randomly unpredictable amino acid pairs are more sensitive to the mutations. The larger is the difference between actual and predicted frequencies, the higher is the chance of mutation occurring. The effect induced by mutations is to reduce the difference between actual and predicted frequencies. The amino acid pairs whose actual frequencies are larger than their predicted frequencies are more likely to be targeted by mutations, whereas the amino acid pairs whose actual frequencies are smaller than their predicted frequencies are more likely to be formed after mutations. These findings are identical to our several recent studies, i.e. the mutations represent a process of degeneration inducing human diseases.","Wu, Guang; Yan, Shaomin",Peptides,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15127935/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196978103003309; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196978103003309,570

It is feared that the pandemic maybe more devastating in conflict affected areas in the world. This study assessed the knowledge, attitudes and practices with regard to the COVID-19 in Buea municipality, Cameroon. METHODS: this was a cross-sectional study carried out in communities selected from 5 health areas of the Buea Health District. A questionnaire was administered to collect data on the knowledge, attitudes and practices on COVID-19. The knowledge was measured using a 26-points Liker scale on awareness, mode of transmission, clinical manifestation, site of the infection and prevention. The data was analyzed in SPSS version 25. RESULTS: of the 545 particpants who consented, 21.9% had a correct knowledge of COVID-19, 43.8% had intermediate knowledge, 34.4% had poor knowledge and 11.93% had no knowledge. Majority of the participants (73.3%) knew they were at risk of contacting the infection. They were aware that cleaning and disinfecting the environment (78.8%), reducing contact with animals (56.3%) could help prevent the infection. Even though participants knew about the face mask (93.5%) and hand sanitizers (88.8%), only 21.7% and 32.9% had purchased them respectively. Few participants reported that they will go to a man of God (6.0%), native doctor (3.5%) and auto-medication (25.8%) if infected. CONCLUSION: There is still a knowledge gap in the Buea population with respect to COVID-19. The population is aware of the disease and preventive measures, but few have taken steps to procure essential tools for the prevention. There is need to intensify sensitization to fill the knowledge gap the population has with regards to COVID-19.","Nicholas, Tendongfor; Mandaah, Forlemu Vanessa; Esemu, Seraphine Nkie; Vanessa, Amana Bokagne Theresa; Gilchrist, Kouam Talla Destin; Vanessa, Lambou Fopa; Shey, Nsagha Dickson",Pan Afr Med J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33623559/; https://doi.org/10.11604/pamj.supp.2020.35.2.22963,570

Care at home has proven to be a viable alternative to hospital care, as shown by a project for hospital-based home care conducted in West Sweden. The aim of this study was to describe how children with cancer and parents experienced receiving care at home. After purposive sampling, six children with cancer aged 6–16 and eight parents participated. Semistructured interviews were performed, and the data were analysed using qualitative content analysis. Four main categories emerged: save time and energy in the family; maintain everyday life; feel trust in the healthcare professionals; mixed feelings about getting treatment at home. This hospital-based home care project created good conditions for both children with cancer and their parents to feel secure. In addition, home care can be very child-centric, whereby the caregivers involve the children by taking their thoughts and utterances into account.","de Flon, Malin; Glaffey, Gisela; Jarl, Linda; Sellbrant, Kristin; Nilsson, Stefan",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18126241; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34207704/,570

However, the long-term consequences of such procedures on children’s well-being are not clear. Therefore, this study investigated the psychological impacts of COVID-19 on Jordanian children between the ages of 5–11 years old. A total of 1309 parents with children between the ages of 5 and 11 years old filled in an online survey that included a set of questions to measure their children’s behaviour and emotions before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Being bored (77.5%), irritable (66%), likely to argue with the rest of the family (60.7%), nervous (54.8%), reluctant (54.2%), and lonely (52.4%) were the most frequently reported symptoms compared to the pre-COVID-19 period. Parents reported that screen use of ≥120 min a day was shown among 48.9% of children and 42% of children did <30 min a day of physical activity. ≤8 h of sleep per night was reported among 42.5% of children compared to pre COVID-19.

We summarize findings from a rapid Cochrane review that included cohort and modelling studies to assess the benefits and harms of digital solutions for identifying contacts of confirmed positive cases of an infectious disease. The review included 12 studies, which assessed digital contact tracing for the following infectious diseases: Ebola, tuberculosis, pertussis and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This review revealed low-certainty evidence of a decrease in secondary cases of the targeted infectious disease, if digital contact tracing was used. However, it is uncertain from the currently available evidence whether digital contact tracing would produce more reliable counts of contacts and reduce the time taken to complete contact tracing. Therefore, implementation of digital contact tracing in the context of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic in African countries should be accompanied by a robust monitoring and evaluation framework. There should be an evaluation and documentation of the benefits, cost-effectiveness, acceptability, feasibility, equity impacts, and unintended consequences of the intervention.","Jaca, Anelisa; Iwu, Chinwe Juliana; Wiysonge, Charles Shey",Pan Afr Med J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33294109/; https://doi.org/10.11604/pamj.supp.2020.37.8.25986,570
686546,From Face-to-Face to Online Modality: Implications for Undergraduate Learning While the World is Temporarily Closed in the Age of COVID-19,2020-08-31,"Background: Past research suggests that knowledge supports- but strong illness expectations thwart- adoption of protective behaviors (e.g., handwashing). Strong illness expectations may place COVID-19 essential workers at risk. It is unclear, however, whether knowledge can moderate the negative effects of pessimistic illness expectations on protective behaviors. We test COVID-19 knowledge as a moderator of the effects of (1) pessimistic illness expectations and (2) essential worker status on adherence to protective behaviors. Methods: Participants (n = 350) completed measures of knowledge, illness expectations, and protective behaviors. We used chi-square tests to examine associations between variables and logistic regressions to test the moderation models predicting adherence (low, high) while controlling for demographics. Results: Knowledge, illness expectations, and adherence were significantly associated with each other (p < 0.05). Essential workers had stronger illness expectations and lower knowledge than did non-essential workers (p < 0.001). Logistic regressions showed a non-significant Worker Status × Knowledge interaction (p = 0.59) but a significant Knowledge × Illness Expectations interaction (p < 0.05) indicating that those with strong illness expectations and low knowledge were disproportionately at risk of failing to adhere to recommended behaviors. Conclusions: Knowledge promotes protective behaviors by buffering the negative effects of pessimistic illness expectations. Essential workers are more likely to have low levels of knowledge with strong illness expectations, suggesting that educational policies may be warranted.","Miller, Lisa M.
