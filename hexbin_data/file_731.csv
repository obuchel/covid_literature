Haematological changes suggestive of sepsis occurred in 83% and positive bacteriological cultures were found in 38%, the most common organism isolated being Clostridium perfringens. Complications included intestinal perforation in six patients and recurrence of NEC in five, of whom one subsequently developed an intestinal stricture. Five of the eight nursery deaths were secondary to peritonitis and overwhelming sepsis from NEC. In spite of the discontinuation of milk feeds for prolonged periods, satisfactory caloric intake and weight gain were achieved with parenteral nutrition in the survivors. Of the 41 long‐term survivors, six (15%) were found to have a disability at 2 years of ago, corrected for prematurity, compared with 48 (20%) of 241 very low birthweight survivors from the same study period who did not have NEC. None had evidence of gastrointestinal dysfunction. Six (15%) children remained below the 10th percentile for both weight and height. This study showed that early diagnosis and therapy for NEC in very tow birthweight infants were associated with a favourable short‐ and long‐term outcome.","YU, V. Y.

The paper also analyses the impact of lagged synergy (a proxy of sales growth) on the post merger and acquisition (M&A) performance of acquiring firms. The study employs System Generalised Method of Moment model (System GMM) to the panel dataset of 64 Indian firms from 2012 to 2018 to determine the synergy impacts and value creation post merger and acquisition (M&A). The outcome of the study signs that mergers create positive value for post merger acquiring firms, and lagged synergy influences future synergies positively. The lagged dependent variable synergy (p-value is 0.000) shows a significant positive effect on dependent variable synergy, which indicates that previous year sales of the firm have a positive effect on future year sales. If the acquisition of firm post merger and acquisition (M&A) effectively absorbs acquired firm resources and digests nutrition from those resources, then the value can be created, and synergy can be achieved, or at least not damaged. Corporate managers, policy makers and regulators can lure significant conclusions from the outcomes of the study. This study for managers concludes that a strong view of possible synergies that can be accomplished through mergers, timelines and processes to achieve them, all of which will aid in the post merger integration process. This knowledge and understanding also helps to optimise the effect of lagged synergies. The results have also important consequences for academics and give impetus to further research. Future research can be undertaken by comprising premiums paid, cross borders mergers, hostile or friendly mergers that may shed some supplementary insights. This paper contributes to value addition in the literature of post M&A as it analyses value creation and effect of lagged synergy in terms of sales. There are limited studies that observed the relationship of value creation and merger and acquisition (M&A), especially in the context of Indian sectors; moreover, this paper takes into consideration different sectors viz. Manufacturing, Mining, Electricity, Construction, Service and Real Estate which gives a holistic view of Indian sectors.","Gupta, Isha; Mishra, Nandita; Tripathy, Naliniprava",The Importance of New Technologies and Entrepreneurship in Business Development: In The Context of Economic Diversity in Developing Countries,731,1

As part of the dissertation, and as a design strategy approach, a visual study on facial expressions was developed, culminating in a book with about 250 photographs, which aims to reflect upon the way we interpret the facial expressions that hide behind health masks. This study uses photographs of different facial expressions of 35 people, with and without health mask, to show how facial expressions are influenced by the use of this item. In this way, it seeks to draw attention to the bias in the perception and interpretation of the facial expression of people wearing health masks. The study shows that non-verbal communication is negatively affected by the use of health masks, making it difficult to interpret the emotional state of the person wearing them.","Santos, Vasco; Macedo, Miguel; Bispo, Renato",Advances in Design and Digital Communication,731,1

Surprisingly, despite being “overfit” in this way, they tend to generalize well to future data, thereby defying the classic bias–variance trade-off of machine learning theory. Of the many possible explanations, a prevalent one is that training by stochastic gradient descent (SGD) imposes an implicit bias that leads it to learn simple functions, and these simple functions generalize well. However, the specifics of this implicit bias are not well understood. In this work, we explore the smoothness conjecture which states that SGD is implicitly biased towards learning functions that are smooth. We propose several measures to formalize the intuitive notion of smoothness, and we conduct experiments to determine whether SGD indeed implicitly optimizes for these measures. Our findings rule out the possibility that smoothness measures based on first-order derivatives are being implicitly enforced. They are supportive, though, of the smoothness conjecture for measures based on second-order derivatives.

Yet little is known about how they succeed in approximating complex distributions, given the seemingly limited expressiveness of individual affine layers. In this work, we take a first step towards theoretical understanding by analyzing the behaviour of a single affine coupling layer under maximum likelihood loss. We show that such a layer estimates and normalizes conditional moments of the data distribution, and derive a tight lower bound on the loss depending on the orthogonal transformation of the data before the affine coupling. This bound can be used to identify the optimal orthogonal transform, yielding a layer-wise training algorithm for deep affine flows. Toy examples confirm our findings and stimulate further research by highlighting the remaining gap between layer-wise and end-to-end training of deep affine flows.

This call underscores the supreme importance of the rule of law in global perspective by construing law as both constitutive of social institutions and a fundamental institution in its own right. In both capacities law historically has acted to buffer public goods and vulnerable populations from the vicissitudes of market supply and demand. For this reason, law schools—where we teach and train most new lawyers and judges—have been a particularly sensitive kind of institution. Yet, during the 2000s the West saw the rise of “for-profit” law schools—institutions of legal education and scholarship newly created with the mission of commercial gain, sometimes for the benefit of outside investors or investment “funds.” What effect might this historical turn have had on law and its practice in the twenty-first century, and what does this say more generally about democratic ideals in the West during this period? For instance, that for-profit law schools emerged simultaneously with the major accounting and banking scandals of the decade may be no coincidence. This chapter argues, therefore, that the rise of for-profit legal education was a symptom of changes in U.S moral economy, and in the social and political climate of the West more generally. Namely, this development points to an emerging conception of law as primarily in the service of economic rather than social life.","Tejani, Riaz",Crime Prevention and Justice in 2030,731,7

During recent years, India’s water usage has increased and diversified, creating both increased water shortages and water quality degradation in rivers and aquifers, thereby threatening broader environmental sustainability. River healthcare gaps blight the quality of life of the average Indian who have been relegated to the periphery. Whereas governments are expected to restore and maintain the wholesomeness of the rivers ensuring environmental flows and preventing the pollution ingress into the water bodies, it is also noteworthy that the protection of water and environmental infrastructure is a social responsibility of every citizen—both individually and collectively. In this background, the paper examines the Ganga conservation and rejuvenation strategies and its impact on environment and drinking water. While government is committed for conserving and rejuvenating National River Ganga, and also addressing interrelated issues like sustainable agriculture, basin protection against floodplains disasters, river hazard management, urban river management, wastewater management and revival of water bodies for providing environmentally safe sanitation and through a well-designated scheme of afforestation in riparian zones to purify base flows and run-off draining into the river, they are also working on to enhance the ecosystem services of our rivers and water bodies that remain healthy for downstream users. In this regard, institutional network of integrated water resource management plan, policy and regulatory governance provides synergy and helps other key stakeholders, experts, investors and well-wishers. On micro-level, key points of river restoration include aspects of flows (aviralta, nirmalta) and functions of river as geologic entity and ecological entity. One may track river science, engineering and operations including afforestation and biodiversity to suggest ways of improving the overall efficacy of aquatic ecology, ecological restoration (lateral, longitudinal and vertical connectivity) and geological safeguarding (sediment transport, assessing quantity, quality and nutrient value). Critical success of recovering wastewater and restoration of drains are components of urban river management. Decentralized infrastructure can greatly enhance the speed of water treatment leading to one city-one operator through reuse of treated sewage/trade effluents. In order to have a successful water economics, it essentially requires creating enabling environment for sustained infrastructure management through water valuation, pricing and effective implementation of the urban river management strategies, and well-functioning water markets.

Although GPUs can be used for accelerating the R-GCN processing, there is a possibility that the size of weight matrices exceeds GPU device memory. To address this issue, in this paper, an edge attribute-wise partitioning is proposed for R-GCN. The proposed partitioning divides the model and graph data so that R-GCN can be accelerated by using multiple GPUs. Also, the proposed approach can be applied to sequential execution on a single GPU. Both the cases can accelerate the R-GCN processing with large graph data, where the original model cannot be fit into a device memory of a single GPU without partitioning. Experimental results demonstrate that our partitioning method accelerates R-GCN by up to 3.28 times using four GPUs compared to CPU execution for a dataset with more than 1.6 million nodes and 5 million edges. Also, the proposed approach can accelerate the execution even with a single GPU by 1.55 times compared to the CPU execution for a dataset with 0.8 million nodes and 2 million edges.","Kibata, Tokio; Tsukada, Mineto; Matsutani, Hiroki",Euro-Par 2020: Parallel Processing Workshops,731,7

These methods include replication, triplication, Algorithm-Based Fault Tolerance (ABFT) and residual checking (RC). Error correction for ABFT can be achieved either by solving a small-size linear system of equations, or by recomputing corrupted coefficients. We show that both approaches can be used for RC. We provide a synthetic presentation of all methods before discussing their pros and cons. We have implemented all these methods with calls to optimized BLAS routines, and we provide performance data for a wide range of failure rates and matrix sizes.","Fèvre, Valentin Le; Herault, Thomas; Langou, Julien; Robert, Yves",Euro-Par 2020: Parallel Processing Workshops,731,7

Accurate diagnosis of thyroid nodules through ultrasound images is significant for cancer detection at the early stage. Many Computer-Aided Diagnose (CAD) systems for this task ignore the inherent correlation between nodule segmentation task and classification task (i.e. cancer grading). Actually, segmentation results could be used as localization cues of thyroid nodules for facilitating their classifications as benign or malignant. Accordingly, we propose a two-stage thyroid nodule diagnosis method through 1) nodule segmentation and 2) segmentation-guided diagnosis. Specifically, in the segmentation stage, we use an ensemble strategy to integrate segmentations from diverse segmentation networks. Then, in the classification stage, the obtained segmentation result is integrated as additional information along with its corresponding original ultrasound images as the input of the classification network. Meanwhile, the segmentation result is further served as guidance to refine the attention map of the features used for classification. Our method is applied to the TN-SCUI 2020, a MICCAI 2020 Challenge, with the largest set of thyroid nodule ultrasound images according to our knowledge. Our method achieved the 2nd place in its classification challenge.","Lu, Jintao; Ouyang, Xi; Liu, Tianjiao; Shen, Dinggang","Segmentation, Classification, and Registration of Multi-modality Medical Imaging Data",731,7

As e-books are not yet commonly used in Japan, this paper examines the impact of the pandemic on the use of e-books in academic libraries in Japan. As a case study, the usage data for each e-book platform in Kyushu University in Japan were analyzed, and the overall trends in each period before and during the pandemic were revealed. The access counts of e-books from January to June 2019 and those for 2020 were examined. The number of total access counts in 2020 was higher than that in 2019 on all nine platforms. The platform that saw the highest access count growth rate was JSTOR, with an 846% increase. The usage of e-books in the Maruzen eBook Library, which holds many Japanese textbooks, was examined in detail. E-books on mathematics, medical science, and programming languages were in constant use both before and during the pandemic. E-books in law and economics started to be used during the pandemic.

In this volume, we identify and analyse these challenges, and compare them to those of learners of English. The global success of English has led to language learning crises in Anglophone countries. Despite these underlying commonalities, the specifics of the crisis manifest both in the school context (Part I) and in Higher Education (Part II) and vary from one country to the next. Complex combinations of liberalisation, decentralisation and marketisation, and, in some Anglophone countries, rising nationalism, all contribute to a gradual but steady erosion of language learning. We furthermore describe how four linguistic ‘myopias’ commonly support the erosion of language learning, namely: ignoring existing plurilingual (community) competencies; essentialising English first language (English L1) language learners as (somehow inherently) incompetent in language learning; ignoring the disadvantageous conditions of English L1 learners; and laying the problem, and potential solutions, at the door of individual schools or institutions, rather than addressing policies and practices more widely. Our Ways Forward sections of this volume (Parts III, IV and V) describe innovative and promising ways out of the crisis, invariably by addressing one (or several) of the above-described myopias, for instance, by schools adopting language policies which include students’ community languages.

We have no holistic view of how readers interact with diverse resources, social and digital, to obtain reading recommendations. Users can consult computer-generated summaries and human-created reviews. How much or how often the typical user relies on one or other source, or what variations there are by genre of intended reading, are both open questions. To narrow these research gaps, we conducted a diary study to capture a comprehensive picture of readers’ use of algorithm- and social-sourced information to inform their future reading choices. Based on a qualitative analysis of these diaries, we produced a survey to investigate in-depth readers’ recommendation preferences across fictional reading, factual reading, academic resources, and news and articles. We show that users rely on different sources of recommendation information in different ways across different genres, and that modern social media plays an increasing role alongside established mass media, especially for fiction.","Zhang, Huiwen; Buchanan, George; McKay, Dana","Diversity, Divergence, Dialogue",731,7

JD causes huge economic losses to the dairy industry due to reduced milk production and premature culling. Infected animals excrete MAP via feces during the prolonged subclinical stage without exhibiting any clinical signs. Therefore, accurate detection of subclinical stage animals is crucial for successful eradication of JD in the herd. In the current study, we analyzed serum samples of MAP-infected and non-infected cattle to identify potential biomarker candidates. First, we identified 12 differentially expressed serum proteins in subclinical and clinical shedder groups compared to the healthy control group. Second, we conducted ELISA for three selected biomarkers (alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M), alpha-1-beta glycoprotein, and transthyretin) and compared their diagnostic performance with that of two commercial ELISA diagnostic kits. Serum A2M levels were significantly higher in the MAP-exposed, subclinical shedder, subclinical non-shedder, and clinical shedder groups than in the healthy control group, suggesting its possible use as a diagnostic biomarker for MAP infection. Furthermore, A2M demonstrated a sensitivity of 90.4%, and a specificity of 100% while the two commercial ELISA kits demonstrated a sensitivity of 67.83 and 73.04% and a specificity of 100%, respectively. In conclusion, our results suggest that measuring A2M by ELISA can be used as a diagnostic tool to detect MAP infection, considerably improving the detection rate of subclinical shedders and MAP-exposed animals that are undetectable using current diagnostic tools.","Park, Hyun-Eui; Park, Jin-Sik; Park, Hong-Tae; Choi, Jeong-Gyu; Shin, Jeong-Ih; Jung, Myunghwan; Kang, Hyung-Lyun; Baik, Seung-Chul; Lee, Woo-Kon; Kim, Donghyuk; Yoo, Han Sang; Shin, Min-Kyoung",Front Vet Sci,731,7

The choice of transport mode often depends on the distance travelled and the motivation for the journey. Among the conditions and variables that most influence the propensity to use a shared transport mode, the distance between the users’ places of origin or destination and the parking areas covered plays an important role, especially in the case of station-based type. The common system that has become more and more widespread in Italy is car sharing, with its various forms (i.e. station-based, free-floating, electric vehicles) that allow the use of reserved parking spaces or shared with other circulating vehicles. In urban areas, people generally tend to walk the first and last mile or use micro-mobility, while for longer distances they tend to use private or shared motor vehicles. Starting from this premise, this thesis provides a methodology for evaluating the effectiveness of car sharing by measuring the probability of using it based on parking distance.

Today’s world population requires more natural resources be consumed than in previous decades, thus contributing to making primary resources increasingly scarce and with limited access. Furthermore, an issue that persisted over time to become unsustainable is the waste emergency. It is also linked to the low capacity of operators to recover and re-use scraps of the production processes losing production values and generating environmental pressure. Companies, whose growth is crucial for the economic system, generate waste in all stages of the production processes; although there is an increasing attention and awareness on the issue of waste, we are still in the early stages of the process that will lead SMEs to zero waste production. If we recognize such attribute as a competitive factor, we can identify in advance a critical innovation demand generated by SMEs operating in low competitive areas which has to be supported with technological transfer inn order to result “green” and effective in the short/medium term. This paper presents data and defines there critical innovations domain in order to deliver an effective and scalable innovation transfer concerning circular economy thorough the application of green chemistry principles exploiting territorial factors in order to deliver sustainable local production chains.","Cerminara, Iole; Chiummiento, Lucia; Funicello, Maria; Lupattelli, Paolo; Scafato, Patrizia; Scorza, Francesco; Superchi, Stefano",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,731,7

It echoes the theory of general resilience in ecology and is not linked to catastrophic events. Complexity theory informs principles of resilient systems that can be applied to urban form. This paper shows how morphological resilience can be assessed in a wide metropolitan area using geoprocessing protocols and available geospatial information. More specifically, a two-step methodology is proposed and tested on the French Riviera. First, spatial units of analysis are identified based on the interconnectedness of the street network, which is a major morphological component in itself. Next, a set of morpho-functional quantitative indicators of resilience is computed for such spatial units, accounting for both internal structure and integration within the wider metropolitan area. Thirteen indicators are selected to describe five different proxies of morphological resilience: diversity, connectivity, redundancy, modularity and efficiency. The paper also presents the preliminary results of morphological resilience assessment in the French Riviera. Urban central areas on the coast generally show more resilient characteristics, while more contrasted patterns emerge in the hinterland.","Fusco, Giovanni; Venerandi, Alessandro",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,731,7

Insular regions and small islands in particular are critical spatial entities in this respect, as lagging behind regions confronted with a range of contemporary risks and challenges. These raise concerns for spatial planning and policies that are capable of dealing with their geographical specificities. However, issues of conceptual clarification and methodological approach regarding as to the insularity phenomenon remain rather open at the official planning scene. The problem lies in the lack of a multi-factorial assessment of islands’ dynamics and determination of their area of influence or their dependence on powerful insular/mainland territories. Focusing on the Aegean insular territory, it is investigated whether, and under what conditions, isolation or relinquishment of small islands can be prevented, and smart sustainable development can be ensured. The answer is sought in the leveraging of their competitive advantages as a ground for endogenous development and their organic inclusion in broader spatial, sectoral, and social networks of supralocal/supranational reach.","Theodora, Yiota",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,731,7

The rupture culminated in mud flow. A study and characterization of the area was made, to understand the flow of the waters, and consequently, the mud. In addition, it was possible to obtain information on the land use of the area before and after the break using remote sensing (Sentinel-2A) supervised image classification. Through a spatial and temporal analysis, it was estimated that the mud reached a total of 2.48 km(2), being the class of robust vegetation the most affected by the disaster in numerical terms. The typology of anthropic areas, despite being the smallest area hit by mud, was the one that suffered the greatest impact. The importance of an analysis of the elements that belong in the area of study and how they behave, in order to avoid and mitigate situations of vulnerability is considered very important.

It is therefore the task of territorial planning discipline to explore methodological approaches capable of making explicit complex relationships in order to use them as tools for effectively designing the sustainable development. In this paper, we report changes in land use over a 28-year period considering the territory of the Basilicata region. Our aim is to translate these changes in ecosystem services values, highlighting potentials of a framework able to integrate monetary figures into a larger approach based on the interactions between biomes and the meaning of human well-being more closely linked to the economics sector. The results show that the greatest loss occurred at the detriment of wooded areas and agricultural mosaic while bare land and arable land increased. Several municipalities experienced significant changes involving above all the classes in the agricultural compartment. The growth of urban settlements took place everywhere affecting to a much greater extent the most important centers, the only ones not subject to depopulation. Our estimate quantifies these changes in a total annual loss of ecosystem service delivery higher than €39 million with some municipalities where this loss corresponds to a significant part of GDP. Reversing the perspective, moreover, the internal areas emerge where, also due to depopulation, the monetization of ecosystem services leads to pro capita amounts equivalent to multiples of GDP per capita.

The study was developed over two years in two different fields (one field per year). Three different N fertilization approaches applied to the second fertilization were compared by integrating NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data from Sentinel 2 satellites (S2), grain yield, and protein content. In both fields used for the experimentation, the three treatments were defined as follows: 1) a standard rate (Flat-N) derived by an N balance approach; 2) a variable rate based on S2 NDVI, where the maximum rate was equal to the standard rate (Var-N-low); 3) a variable rate based on S2 NDVI, where the average rate was equal to the standard rate (Var-N-high). An inverse linear relationship between NDVI and N-rates was applied to calculate VRT doses on the assumption that NDVI and other correlated VIs, before the second N fertilization, are directly related to crop N nutritional status. Results show that differences between treatments in terms of NDVI, grain yield, and protein content were very low and generally not significant, suggesting that a low-N management approach, even using simple linear models based on NDVI and VRT, may considerably improve the economic and environmental sustainability of N fertilization in winter wheat. Further experiments are necessary to better explore the proposed approaches and compare them, by example, with the NDVI proportional methods that could be more suitable when the crop growth is mainly influenced by limiting factors other than N nutrition status.","Santaga, Francesco; Benincasa, Paolo; Vizzari, Marco",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,731,1

The research was carried out at 75 agricultural enterprises in 10 administrative districts where 894 calves aged from one month to 12 months were tested for cryptosporidiosis. The Bayesian inference method was used to predict the prevalence of cryptosporidiosis. The maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of infestation of young animals in the region was 0.0391. To get a conjugate beta-posterior in Bayesian statistics, binomial and beta distributions were chosen for likelihood and prior respectively. A 95% credible interval for posterior prevalence was [0.0418, 0.0685]. Cryptosporidiosis was common in 22.7% of cattle farms in the Akmola region, mainly in large industrial enterprises, where there are more favourable conditions for maintaining the biotic potential of the disease pathogens. At the same time, calves up to one month of age are infested with cryptosporidia to a higher degree than animals of older age groups.

Whereas Nanopore technology generates long reads with high error rates, short read technologies - such as Illumina sequencing - generate shorter reads but with low error rate. Since de novo genome assembly of sequencing reads is defined as a NP-hard problem, it remains as one of the major challenges for defining reference genomes of different species. This paper aims to improve the quality of reads obtained through Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). We developed an algorithm to associate the reads obtained from Illumina with the ones obtained with Nanopore. Low accuracy ONT reads were corrected with the high quality Illumina reads to achieve an improved sequencing data. The inclusion of this algorithm as a preprocessing step resulted in improved coverage, contig length, and mismatch rate when performing de novo genome assembly of a bacterial genome with well known tools.","Aldridge-Águila, Jacqueline; Álvarez-Saravia, Diego; Navarrete, Marcelo; Uribe-Paredes, Roberto",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,731,7

A monitoring system has been installed in the Dome since 1955 to monitor the behavior of the cracks; today, it counts more than 160 instruments, such as mechanical and electronic deformometers, thermometers, piezometers. The analyses carried out to date show slight increases in the size of the main cracks and, at the same time, a clear relationship with some environmental variables. However, due to the extension of the monitoring system and the complexity of collected data, to our knowledge an analysis involving all the detected variables has not yet conducted. In this contribution, we aim at finding simplified structures (i.e., latent common factors or principal components) that summarize the measurements coming from the different instruments and explain the overall behavior of the Dome across the time. We found that the overall behavior of the Dome tracked by multiple sensors may be satisfactorily summarized with a single principal component, which shows a sinusoidal time trend characterized, in a one-year period, by an expansive phase followed by a contractive phase.

Satellite images are the most appropriate for environmental monitoring as they provide high resolution multispectral optical images, infact are able to monitor the development of vegetation by assessing the water content an changes in chlorophyll levels. This study can be useful to spatial planning authorities as a tool for assessing and monitoring eroded soil in areas affected by fires, representing a useful tool for land management.","Santarsiero, Valentina; Nolè, Gabriele; Lanorte, Antonio; Tucci, Biagio; Saganeiti, Lucia; Pilogallo, Angela; Scorza, Francesco; Murgante, Beniamino",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,731,7

Such abstract model is called Abstract Syntax Tree and the inference task is called parsing. A parser is usually generated from a grammar specification of a (programming) language and it converts source code of that language into said abstract tree representation. Then, several techniques traverse this tree to assess the quality of the code (for example by computing source code metrics), or by building new data structures (e.g, flow graphs) to perform further analysis (such as, code cloning, dead code, etc). Parsing is a well established technique. In recent years, however, modern languages are inherently ambiguous which can only be fully handled by ambiguous grammars. In this setting disambiguation rules, which are usually included as part of the grammar specification of the ambiguous language, need to be defined. This approach has a severe limitation: disambiguation rules are not first class citizens. Parser generators offer a small set of rules that can not be extended or changed. Thus, grammar writers are not able to manipulate nor define a new specific rule that the language he is considering requires. In this paper we present a tool, name InDubio, that consists of an extensible combinator library of disambiguation filters together with a generalized parser generator for ambiguous grammars. InDubio defines a set of basic disambiguation rules as abstract syntax tree filters that can be combined into more powerful rules. Moreover, the filters are independent of the parser generator and parsing technology, and consequently, they can be easily extended and manipulated. This paper presents InDubio in detail and also presents our first experimental results.","Macedo, José Nuno; Saraiva, João",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,731,1

Although the transition will impact all countries, its effects are arguably more profound in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). This is because MENA countries are major hydrocarbon producers and significant hydrocarbon consumers and because hydrocarbons underwrite the ruling bargain between states, societies, and business. This chapter provides an overview of the two major themes explored throughout this volume. The first explores the role, evolution, interactions, and efficacy of energy stakeholders; the second relates to the geopolitical balance at the bilateral and regional levels during the energy transition. The contention is that politics, more so than economics or environmental pressure, will determine the speed and scope of low carbon energy uptake in MENA. While politics facilitates the transition to a low carbon energy system in some countries, it complicates the pathway for others.","Sim, Li-Chen; Mills, Robin",Low Carbon Energy in the Middle East and North Africa,731,7

The global development and the spread of “win-win” financial instruments such as the Social Impact Bonds (SIBs) outlines a growing interest in making an investment that aims at generating benefits for all the subjects involved, always guaranteeing a monetary return to the private investor. The complexity of identifying the social impact sectors to be preferred, in a context characterized by different social needs, represents a critical issue in the SIBs investment. This research defines a model that can constitute a decision support tool for the public and private subjects in the preliminary phases concerning the resource allocation for a social program. The proposed algorithm allows to define a temporal priority of the social impact sectors that are simultaneously able to maximize the conveniences for all the subjects involved. Through the model, the public and private subjects will be able to determine the best allocation of financial resources according to the real social needs, contributing to an effective spread of SIBs both in Italy and abroad.","Tajani, Francesco; Morano, Pierluigi; Anelli, Debora; Torre, Carmelo Maria",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,731,7

In [14, 17], the authors have considered the facilities and high qualified staff of Portuguese Navy and proposed a variant of the Delphi method, a method that is exceptionally useful where the judgments of individuals are considered as an important information source. They proposed a system that prioritize certain teams for specific incidents taking into account the importance of each team that acts in case of emergency. In the present work we propose a distinct method of computing the weights that represent the importance given to experts opinion in the Delphi method used in [14, 17] under the idea that shall not depend on the years of experience of each expert exclusively but also shall be considered the kind of expert experience. To justify this suggestion we have used hierarchical classification, allowing to identify different padrons for experts with the “same experience”. Also discriminant analysis and multidimensional scaling revealed to be adequate techniques for this issue. We can classify the experience of each expert evaluating the similarity/distance between the individuals in the group of proposed experts and compare with the number of consensus presented. In this manuscript we propose an alternative way of weighting the experts experience that contributes to a decision support system capable to prioritize a set of teams for certain disaster incidents involving maritime issues. The decision support system is still been tested but, with this work, we hope to have given an improvement to its optimization.","Teodoro, M. Filomena; Marques, Mário J.

A block of the Naples historic downtown (Italy) has been selected as a sample to verify the transformations induced by the airification process of the city since 2015 on the social and urban environment, investigating the influence on real estate dynamics, and their impacts related to economic, social, cultural and urban criteria. The mapping of Airbnb listings on the block has allowed to analyse the economic convenience of renting short-term housing, identifying an income surplus defined as “interstitial rent”, which represents the economic advantage achieved. The analyses carried out on the average market values of the properties on Airbnb have revealed the tendency to redevelop the “waste building stock”, which is unattractive for the ordinary market, in view of its turbo-valorisation by converting it into accommodation. The attractiveness characteristics of the properties were compared to the average market values to investigate the housing stock that can be removed from the ordinary residence market in view of its value enhancement. This research has highlighted the progressive gentrification of the historic center and the relocation of the permanent inhabitants outside it. Therefore, investigating the prevailing sentiment that agitates the social organisations of Europe, we have come to provide an intervention proposal for the regulation of post covid-19 housing policy, which tends to co-participated formulation of strategic choices, involving all interested parties, in order to find a shared application.","Cerreta, Maria; Mura, Fernanda Della; Poli, Giuliano",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,731,7

On the one hand, the UAE is a champion of renewable and nuclear power, an oft-cited example of an OPEC member that has made significant progress in zero-carbon electricity generation. On the other hand, the UAE is completing one of the largest coal-fired power plants in the Middle East. If current government goals are realized, the country will generate far more power from coal, the most carbon- and pollution-intensive fuel, than it will with renewables. Three main pressures lie behind the UAE’s decision to turn away from its 50-year legacy of natural gas-dominated power generation. First is the fragmentation of electricity policy among the seven emirates. Second are the diplomatic breaches with major holders of regional natural gas supply. And third are various economic drivers, ranging from volatile gas import prices to plummeting costs of solar panels. This paper finds that while uncertainties surround the eventual scale of renewables’ contribution, the increase in coal combustion appears destined to undermine the UAE’s already minimal carbon competitiveness.

The two main properties of such systems are anonymity and verifiability. To provide anonymity, a blind signature or a ring signature is often used. To provide verifiability, distributed ledger technologies, in particular blockchain, have recently been used. One of these systems has been presented at ICCSA 2019. This system is implemented using Hyperledger Fabric blockchain platform and uses a blind signature to provide anonymity. One of the disadvantages of this system is that a compromised signer (an organizer generating a blind signature) could independently create valid ballots without detection. In this paper, we modify this system by replacing a blind signature with a linkable ring signature in order to eliminate this disadvantage. As a result, we combine linkable ring signature, Idemix and blockchain technologies to construct a decentralized anonymous e-voting system that does not rely on a trusted signer and can achieve the following properties: eligibility, unreusability, anonymity, and verifiability. In addition, the use of both a linkable ring signature and Idemix allows us to construct a two-stage anonymization, that increases the versatility of the proposed system. This allows us to use a blockchain platform (for example, Hyperledger Fabric) to implement the e-voting system, without making changes to platform standard signature scheme.","Kyazhin, Sergey; Popov, Vladimir",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,731,7

The analysis started with the description of all response variables. Then, by using IBM® SPSS software, the Friedman’s test was used to compare how the coefficient of friction varied among samples in five-time points. From this test, results showed that there was no statistically significant difference in the coefficient of friction mean values over the selected time points. Then, the two-samples Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test was used to test the effect of the diamond particles size and the type of technology on the mean of the coefficient of friction over time. The results showed that, for both sintering techniques, the size of the diamond particles significantly affected the values of the coefficient of friction, whereas no statistical differences were found between the tested sintering techniques. Also, the two-way ANOVA test was used to evaluate how these factors influence the specific wear rate, which conducted to the same conclusions drawn for the previous test.

A key feature of this software is using a dataset that is prepared without manual labeling of all obstacles and the probability of a collision. Currently, an important task in mobile robotics is the need to use numerous heuristics and deterministic algorithms in control programs along with neural networks. The use of a single neural network that solves all the tasks of scene analysis (the so-called “end-to-end” solution) is impossible for several reasons: the high complexity of the training samples due to the large parameter space of the environment of the robot and the insufficient formalization of these parameters, as well as the computational complexity of machine learning algorithms, which is critical for mobile robots with strict energy requirements. Therefore, the development of a universal algorithm (end-to-end) is a laborious process. The article describes a method that allows to use weakly formalized parameters of the robot environment for training convolutional neural networks with attention using the obstacle recognition task.

Sequence alignment helps us to identify the evolutionary distance among various species. Sequence alignment is of two types: pairwise and multiple. In pairwise sequence alignment only two sequences are compared in contrast to multiple sequence alignment where more than two sequences can be analyzed. We have also discussed the methods for phylogenetic tree construction using different methods.","Singh, Sidharth; Haque, M.

The government defined the main guidelines for the creation of this digital signature solution through ordinances. According to the MEC, the deadline for implementing a system for signing University Degree and documents in digital format must be established by 2022. This work presents a digital signature solution for the University of Brasïlia (UnB). Besides, we demonstrate the current architecture used by UnB and how the creation of new solutions can be incorporated into this architecture. Thus, we present the internal architecture of the digital signature module and demonstrate how the developed solution will be integrated into the current architecture of UnB. As a main result, the proposed solution presents a reduction in the costs of signing digital documents and allows higher speed in signing University Degree and documents in digital format.","Ribeiro, Renato Carauta; Canedo, Edna Dias",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,731,7

We analyze these scenarios evaluating the system stability through a formal analysis of coalitional and non-cooperative games and the notions of collective actions and robustness. We used socially inspired computing to propose a negotiation method that allows the members of the system to cooperate and manage common-pool resources without any central controller or other orchestration forms. The model was evaluated using four quantitative moral metrics through simulation techniques. The result showed how a system influenced by ethical behaviors exhibited higher efficiency, symmetry, and invariance over time.","Latorre, Julian F.; Ospina, Juan P.; Sánchez, Joaquín F.; Collazos-Morales, Carlos",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,731,7

Recently, some researchers have begun to explore Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in agricultural field for leaves diseases identification. A CNN is a category of deep artificial neural networks that has demonstrated great success in computer vision applications, such as video and image analysis. However, their drawbacks are the demand of huge quantity of data with a wide range of conditions, as well as a carefully fine-tuning to work properly. This work explores and compares the most outstanding five CNNs architectures to determine their ability to correctly classify a leaf image as healthy and unhealthy. Experimental tests are performed referring to an unbalanced and small dataset composed by healthy and diseased leaves. In order to achieve a high accuracy on the explored CNN models, a fine-tuning of their hyperparameters is performed. Furthermore, some variations are done on the raw dataset to increase the quality and variety of the leaves images. Preliminary results provide a point-of-view for selecting CNNs architectures for leaves diseases identification based on accuracy, precision, recall and F1 metrics. The comparison demonstrates that without considerably lengthening the training, ZFNet achieves a high accuracy and increases it by 10% after 50 K iterations being a suitable CNN model for identification of diseased leaves using datasets with a small variation, number of classes and dataset sizes.","Caluña, Giovanny; Guachi-Guachi, Lorena; Brito, Ramiro",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,731,7

The aim of this preliminary study is to evaluate the possibility to predict a good functional outcome, in terms of modified Rankin Scale (mRS ≤ 2), in thrombolysis treated WUS patients by Bayesian analysis of clinical, demographic and neuroimaging data at admission. The study was conducted on 54 thrombolysis treated WUS patients.

Although humans are exposed to OIT through personal and industrial use, the potentially deleterious effects of OIT on human health are still unknown. To investigate the effects of OIT on the vascular system, which is continuously exposed to xenobiotics through systemic circulation, we treated brain endothelial cells with OIT. OIT treatment significantly activated caspase-3-mediated apoptosis and reduced the bioenergetic function of mitochondria in a bEnd.3 cell-based in vitro blood–brain barrier (BBB) model. Interestingly, OIT significantly altered the thiol redox status, as evidenced by reduced glutathione levels and protein S-nitrosylation. The endothelial barrier function of bEnd.3 cells was significantly impaired by OIT treatment. OIT affected mitochondrial dynamics through mitophagy and altered mitochondrial morphology in bEnd.3 cells. N-acetyl cysteine significantly reversed the effects of OIT on the metabolic capacity and endothelial function of bEnd.3 cells.

Areas Covered: This review offers insights into novel and repurposed drugs that may have activity against SARS-CoV-2. We searched the PubMed, Medline, Google Scholar, Web of Science and ClinicalTrials.gov for COVID-19 related therapy until September 15, 2020 using search words ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""COVID-19"", ""antiviral"", and/or ""treatment"". Expert Opinion: Remdesivir decreased symptom duration modestly but had no significant impact on survival. Antivirals alone may be insufficient for a specific subset of patients with severe disease because of cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Treatment may require a combination of antivirals and immunomodulators to inhibit viral replication and CRS, respectively. A safe and efficacious SARS-CoV-2 specific vaccine is critical for prevention and mortality reduction. Moreover, we cannot overstate the importance of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in testing of novel treatments. The pervasive stumbling block, however, is the low representation of minority groups. The benefit of remdesivir may not be generalizable to these populations because of significant underrepresentation in trials.
