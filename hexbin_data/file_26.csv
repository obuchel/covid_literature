3893,3893,3893,Protocol for development of a risk assessment tool for planning and management of religious mass-gathering events of India—a health system-strengthening initiative,19.912136,3.3448944,2019-06-24,"BACKGROUND: Religious mass gatherings (MGs) have always been an integral part of our society. At the outset, mass-gathering events provide challenging settings to plan a suitable emergency public health response. Published studies basically talk about retrospective reviews, case studies of the public health preparedness, or health care provided at individual events. Developing an understanding of the variables associated with MGs is the first step for public health managers. Risk assessment (RA) is a crucial part of pre-event planning as it helps foresee potential risks. Based on RA, one can develop preventive measures and ensure that the infrastructure to control the potential problems is in place. This study is an attempt to systemize RA process during MG events in a country that is culturally rich but with poor resources to handle such events. A RA tool will be developed for planning and management of religious MG events of India. METHODS/DESIGN: Various strategies will be used to develop the risk assessment tool (RA tool). Extensive review of literature clubbed with key informant interviews will be done in order to identify the risk variables and decide the domains and items of the tool. Further, this tool will be developed as a mobile-based application. The feasibility of the mobile-based RA tool will be tested in real-time MG event in one part of the country. Concurrently in the same event, a community survey of residents and visitors will be done in order to assess public perceptions of public health and environmental risks associated with MG events. DISCUSSION: The findings of this study will provide insights into the public health and environmental concerns that need to be considered if preventive strategies and intervention programs are to be designed for MG events. A “RA Tool,” which can be used in the planning and management of MG events by the public health managers will strengthen the existing health systems preparedness plans for MGs.","Sharma, Upasana; Desikachari, B.

The following classification was used: squamous cell metaplasia with marked keratinization, keratinizing cyst, cystic keratinizing epithelioma, cystic keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma, keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma and non-keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma. In study A (inhalation of coal oven exhaust and subcutaneous injection of a high dose of DB (ah)A) 49.3 % of rats developed cystic keratinizing squamous cell carcinomas. Inhalation of coal oven exhaust gas together with intratracheal instillation of crocidolite or subcutaneous injection of a low dose DB(ah)A (dibenz(ah)anthracene) resulted in cystic keratinizing squamous cell carcinomas in 23 % to 24 % of the rats. High incidences of cystic squamous cell carcinomas in the range of 31.9 % to 76.4 % were observed in rats of Study B1 after a 10-months exposure to tar/pitch condensation aerosol (different B(a)P (benzo(a)pyrene) concentrations) with added carbon black in some groups. After a 20-months exposure period to the same inhalation atmospheres (Study B2) the incidence of squamous cell carcinomas was increased up to 95.8 %. Exposure of rats to various concentrations of unfiltered diesel exhaust (Study C) resulted in incidences of cystic keratinizing epitheliomas ranging from 2.5 % (2.5 mg/m(3)) to 10.7 % (7.5 mg/m(3)). Epitheliomas were also observed in 16.2 % of carbon black and 16.0 % of titanium dioxide exposed rats. Only a few cystic keratinizing squamous cell carcinomas occurred. In the intratrachel instillation study (Study D) increased incidences of cystic keratinizing epitheliomas occurred in rats exposed to native diesel exhaust particles (16.7 %), high dose of extracted diesel exhaust particles (14.6 %), extracted printex 90-carbon black particles (18.8 %), and extracted printex 90-carbon black particles + B(a)P (18.8 %). High indicences of cystic keratinizing squamous cell carcinomas were noted in rats that received 15 mg B(a)P (14.6 %) or 30 mg B(a)P (72.7 %) intratracheally. Immunohistochemical labeling of nuclei with PCNA demonstrated proliferative activity in one or two (and focally more than two) peripheral cell layers of cystic keratinizing epitheliomas and in more than three peripheral cell layers of cystic keratinizing squamous cell carcinomas and keratinizing squamous cell carcinomas. The wall of keratinizing cysts showed no or a weak reaction.","Rittinghausen, S.; Mohr, U.; Dungworth, D.L.",Exp Toxicol Pathol,26,5

The growing need for realism in addressing complex public health questions is, however, calling for accurate models of the human contact patterns that govern the disease transmission processes. Here we present a data-driven approach to generate effective population-level contact matrices by using highly detailed macro (census) and micro (survey) data on key socio-demographic features. We produce age-stratified contact matrices for 35 countries, including 277 sub-national administratvie regions of 8 of those countries, covering approximately 3.5 billion people and reflecting the high degree of cultural and societal diversity of the focus countries. We use the derived contact matrices to model the spread of airborne infectious diseases and show that sub-national heterogeneities in human mixing patterns have a marked impact on epidemic indicators such as the reproduction number and overall attack rate of epidemics of the same etiology. The contact patterns derived here are made publicly available as a modeling tool to study the impact of socio-economic differences and demographic heterogeneities across populations on the epidemiology of infectious diseases.","Mistry, Dina; Litvinova, Maria; Pastore y Piontti, Ana; Chinazzi, Matteo; Fumanelli, Laura; Gomes, Marcelo F.

There is a steady rise in cancer cases, but trends and patterns vary within the state depending on the geographic region. OBJECTIVES: To study the proportion and site-wise distribution of neoplasm reported at a tertiary care hospital in district Etawah, Uttar Pradesh, India. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A record based retrospective study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in district Etawah, Uttar Pradesh. Total four years (from 2015 to 2018) hospital-based retrospective data were collected from the Medical Record Department. Identification and distribution of malignant neoplasm were done according to the WHO ICD-10 classification. RESULTS: Total cases diagnosed with malignancy from January 2015 to December 2018 were 3614. Cancer cases reported over the years was 932 (25.8%) in 2015, 1031 (28.5%) cases in 2016, 897 (24.8%) in 2017 and 754 (20.9%) in 2018. It was found that breast carcinoma (24.0%) accounted for the maximum number of cases diagnosed, followed by lung carcinoma (10.9%), cervical cancer (8.7%), gall bladder carcinoma (8%), and oral cavity cancer (7.9%). CONCLUSION: The present study reveals that the malignancy of the breast is most common, followed by malignancies of lung, cervix, and gall bladder among the patients who were seeking care in a tertiary care hospital of the district Etawah Uttar Pradesh, India.","Shukla, Sushil K.; Sachan, Divyta; Bajpai, Prashant K.; Srivastava, Dhiraj K.; Verma, Manoj K.; Agarwal, Tanya",J Family Med Prim Care,26,5

Despite effective vaccination and improved surgery and treatment, CC retains its fatality rate of about half of the infected population globally. The major screening biomarkers and therapeutic target identification have now become a global concern. In the present study, we have employed systems biology approaches to retrieve the potential biomarkers and pathways from transcriptomic profiling. Initially, we have identified 76 of each up-regulated and down-regulated gene from a total of 4643 differentially expressed genes. The up-regulatory genes mainly concentrate on immune-inflammatory responses, and the down-regulatory genes are on receptor binding and gamma-glutamyltransferase. The involved pathways associated with these genes were also assessed through pathway enrichment, and we mainly focused on different cancer pathways, immunoresponse, and cell cycle pathways. After the subsequent enrichment of these genes, we have identified 12 hub genes, which play a crucial role in CC and are verified by expression profile analysis. From our study, we have found that genes LILRB2 and CYBB play crucial roles in CC, as reported here for the first time. Furthermore, the survivability of the hub genes was also assessed, and among them, finally, CXCR4 has been identified as one of the most potential differentially expressed genes that might play a vital role in the survival of CC patients. Thus, CXCR4 could be used as a prognostic and/or diagnostic biomarker and a drug target for CC.","Oany, Arafat Rahman; Mia, Mamun; Pervin, Tahmina; Alyami, Salem Ali; Moni, Mohammad Ali",J Pers Med,26,5

However, the function of SKP2 in gastric adenocarcinoma remains largely obscure. We investigated SKP2 expression in human gastric carcinomas. Tissue samples were acquired from 182 cases of gastric adenocarcinoma that were surgically resected from 2006 to 2012. Immunohistochemical staining for SKP2, Beclin-1, and forkhead box protein P3 (FOXP3) was performed. Pearson chi-square test was used to evaluate the associations among clinicopathological variables. The Kaplan–Meier method, the log-rank test, and the Cox proportional-hazards model were used in the analysis of the overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). As a result, SKP2 overexpression in gastric adenocarcinomas showed a significant correlation with several favorable clinical factors, including the tumor size, T category, N category, lymphatic invasion, vascular invasion, OS, and DFS. SKP2 expression was positively correlated with the tumoral FOXP3, Beclin-1 expression, and regulatory T cell (Treg) infiltration. The difference in DFS between the SKP2 positive and negative group was attenuated by FOXP3 high expression, Beclin-1 high expression, and Tregs infiltration. Attenuation of the difference in OS by FOXP3 high expression, Beclin-1 high expression, and Tregs infiltration was not significant. In multivariable analysis, SKP2 expression was not correlated with OS and DFS. Our study showed a complex interrelationship between SKP2 and Beclin-1 and FOXP3 expression in gastric adenocarcinoma. The antioncogenic effect of Beclin-1 and FOXP3 expression in gastric adenocarcinoma is related to SKP2 expression.","Kim, Hyung Kyung; Won, Kyu Yeoun; Han, Sang-Ah",Medicine (Baltimore),26,5

METHODS: Silica gel column chromatographic separation was used to isolate compounds. Crude extract and isolated compounds were evaluated for antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans via the broth dilution method. Docking studies were performed with E. coli DNA-Gyrase B and human DNA topoisomerase IIα by using AutoDock Vina. ADMET were predicted by SwissADME, PreADMET, and OSIRIS Property predictions. The optimized structures and molecular electrostatic potential surface of the isolated compounds were predicted by DFT analysis using B3LYP/6-31G basis levels. RESULTS: Silica gel column chromatographic separation afforded five compounds 1–5 of which N-methyl-2,3-bis(2-hydroxybenzyl)-1Н-indol (1) is reported herein for the first time, along with known C-benzylated dihydrochalcone uvaretin (2), bis(2-ethylheptyl) phthalate (3), lupeol (4) and suberosin derivative (5). Dichloromethane roots extract of U. scheffleri showed potent antibacterial activity against S. aureus (MIC = 6.25 µg/mL) compared to gentamicin (MIC=5 µg/mL). In silico, molecular docking analysis of compounds (1and 3–5) showed strong interaction with E. coli DNA gyrase B with a binding energy value ranging from −6.9 to −6.0 kcal/mol compared to ciprofloxacin −7.2 kcal/mol, whereas analysis against human topoisomerase IIα showed binding energy value ranging from −5.9 to −5.3 kcal/mol compared to vosaroxin (−6.2 kcal/mol). CONCLUSION: The results obtained suggest that N-methyl-2,3-bis(2-hydroxybenzyl)-1Н-indol (1) and coumarin (5) are potential topoisomerase II α inhibitors and might be used as anticancer agents. The ADMET studies showed the highest drug-likeness properties for studied compounds other than bis(2-ethylheptyl) phthalate (3). DFT calculations suggested that studied compounds showed the lowest gap energy and were chemically reactive, and isolated compounds may serve as potential drug candidates that corroborate with the traditional uses of studied plants.","Anza, Mathewos; Endale, Milkyas; Cardona, Luz; Cortes, Diego; Eswaramoorthy, Rajalakshmanan; Zueco, Jesus; Rico, Hortensia; Trelis, Maria; Abarca, Belen",Adv Appl Bioinform Chem,26,28

While vaccine candidates and therapeutics are currently undergoing clinical trials, there is yet to be a proven effective treatment or cure for COVID-19. In this study, we have presented a synergistic computational platform, including molecular dynamics simulations and immunoinformatics techniques, to rationally design a multi-epitope vaccine candidate for COVID-19. This platform combines epitopes across Linear B Lymphocytes (LBL), Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTL) and Helper T Lymphocytes (HTL) derived from both mutant and wild-type spike glycoproteins from SARS-CoV-2 with diverse protein conformations. In addition, this vaccine construct also takes the considerable glycan shield of the spike glycoprotein into account, which protects it from immune response. We have identified a vaccine candidate (a 35.9 kDa protein), named COVCCF, which is composed of 5 LBL, 6 HTL, and 6 CTL epitopes from the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. Using multi-dose immune simulations, COVCCF induces elevated levels of immunoglobulin activity (IgM, IgG1, IgG2), and induces strong responses from B lymphocytes, CD4 T-helper lymphocytes, and CD8 T-cytotoxic lymphocytes. COVCCF induces cytokines important to innate immunity, including IFN-γ, IL4, and IL10. Additionally, COVCCF has ideal pharmacokinetic properties and low immune-related toxicities. In summary, this study provides a powerful, computational vaccine design platform for rapid development of vaccine candidates (including COVCCF) for effective prevention of COVID-19.","Martin, William R.; Cheng, Feixiong",ChemRxiv,26,29

The appeal of this model construction is that it can be constructed in a small, intensional, type theoretic metatheory, therefore giving a method to boostrap extensionality. The setoid model has been recently adapted into a formal system, namely Setoid Type Theory (SeTT). SeTT is an extension of intensional Martin-Löf type theory with constructs that give full access to the extensionality principles that hold in the setoid model. Although already a rich theory as currently defined, SeTT currently lacks a way to internalize the notion of type beyond propositions, hence we want to extend SeTT with a universe of setoids. To this aim, we present the construction of a (non-univalent) universe of setoids within the setoid model, first as an inductive-recursive definition, which is then translated to an inductive-inductive definition and finally to an inductive family. These translations from more powerful definition schemas to simpler ones ensure that our construction can still be defined in a relatively small metatheory which includes a proof-irrelevant identity type with a strong transport rule.","Altenkirch, Thorsten; Boulier, Simon; Kaposi, Ambrus; Sattler, Christian; Sestini, Filippo",Foundations of Software Science and Computation Structures,26,1

All orthopaedic consent forms from four-week periods in March, June and July were reviewed. Measures such as staff education were implemented after the second cycle. Of consent forms for 37 operations performed in March, only 1 mentioned the risk of contracting COVID-19 and zero mentioned ITU.

METHOD: Three separate cohorts of adult emergency admissions; emergency admissions prior to lockdown (23(rd) of February to 22(nd) of March), 1 month after (23(rd) of March to 22(nd) of April) and 2 months after (23(rd) of April to 22(nd) of May). Data was collected regarding patient characteristics, duration of symptoms prior to presentation, clinical outcomes and compared between these groups. RESULTS: Notable initial decrease in admission per day (4.3 to 2.5) and interventional management (30%) during the 1(st) month of lockdown. A marked increase in 24-hour discharge rate (50%). These parameters begun to normalize by the 2(nd) month. The rate of overall conservative management gradually increased from 36.7% pre-lockdown to 60.9% at the 2(nd) month. CONCLUSIONS: Providing elective work is cancelled, surgical teams could safely tolerate working with 30%-40% of original staffing level, which will need to be gradually increased to 50%-70% after 1 month.","Abdalla, M l; Connolly, T; Bujoreanu, I; Stylianides, N A",Br J Surg,26,29

Innovative scenarios incorporate three virtues essential to making knowledge systemically useful: creativity, collaboration, and communication. The main features of such a scenario-writing process include: (1) the effective integration of participants from a diverse array of disciplinary perspectives; (2) an integrated approach to defining problems as a system of interrelated structures, functions, and processes; (3) the collaborative learning required to synthesize a comprehensive understanding of the interrelated components and processes of the system containing the problem(s); (4) a process of co-writing that guides the alteration of socio-ecological systems to eliminate the problem(s); and (5) communication that clearly and persuasively conveys the message required to actualize resolution.","Murphy, Michael D.; Day, Don R.",Socio Ecol Pract Res,26,24

This is an area of research in which considerable conflicting results have been produced. In our study, we find that while similarities between these segments exist along demographic factors and donation behaviour (e.g., frequency of donating), important distinctions exist along motivational factors, thereby suggesting differentiated promotion messaging. Surveys were administered to 680 subjects. Their responses along twenty-seven motivational variables were subjected to factor analysis. Cluster analysis was then applied to the factor scores that yielded three donor segments. We find six key motivating factors influencing the donation decision: organizational criteria, external inducements, intrinsic motivators, charity organization attributes, egocentric rewards and economic considerations. We also find three distinct segments of individual donors: intrinsics, sceptics and impressionable. Donations by the intrinsic group members are more influenced by selfless altruistic reasons for donating. Decisions made by members of the skeptic segment result from the examination of charitable organization along such criteria as the clarity of its mission and the efficiency of its management practice. The impressionable segment members are most likely to be influenced by the impact of external factors in the donation decision such as marketing measures employed by the charity and the encouragement of others.","Kolhede, Eric; Gomez-Arias, J.

The molecular mechanisms underlying MG are not fully understood. We analyzed the gene expression profile (GSE85452) and methylation profile (GSE85647) of MG samples from the GEO database to identify aberrantly methylated-differentially expressed genes. By integrating the datasets, we identified 143 hypermethylation-low expression genes and 91 hypomethylation-high expression genes. Then we constructed PPI network and ceRNA networks by these genes. Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and Abelson tyrosine-protein kinase (ABL)1 were critical genes in both PPI networks and ceRNA networks. And potential MG associated lncRNAs were selected by comprehensive analysis of the critical genes and ceRNA networks. In the hypermethylation-low expression genes associated ceRNA network, sirtuin (SIRT)1 was the most important gene and the lncRNA HLA complex (HC) P5 had the highest connection degree. Meanwhile, PTEN was the most important gene and the lncRNA LINC00173 had the highest connection degree in the hypomethylation-high expression genes associated ceRNA network. LINC00173 was validated to be upregulated in MG patients by qRT-PCR (P = 0.005), which indicated LINC00173 might be a potential biomarker for MG. These results provide a basis for future studies on the molecular pathogenesis of MG.","Xu, Si; Wang, Tianfeng; Lu, Xiaoyu; Zhang, Huixue; Liu, Li; Kong, Xiaotong; Li, Shuang; Wang, Xu; Gao, Hongyu; Wang, Jianjian; Wang, Lihua",Front Genet,26,12

METHODS This subset of the prospective, multicenter, single-arm DEFINITIVE LE trial included 158 patients (mean age 72.0±10.9 years; 82 men) who underwent directional atherectomy in 162 popliteal artery lesions between 2009 and 2011. Forty-eight (30.4%) patients were suffering from critical limb ischemia (CLI). The mean lesion length was 5.8±3.9 cm; 38 (23.5%) arteries were occluded. The primary outcome measure for patients with intermittent claudication (IC) was duplex ultrasound-defined primary patency at 1 year; the outcome for subjects with CLI was freedom from major amputation of the target limb at 1 year. Outcomes and adverse events were independently assessed. RESULTS Procedure success (≤30% residual stenosis) was achieved in 84.4% of treated lesions; adjunctive stenting was required in 6 (3.7%) of the 162 lesions. The 1-year primary patency rate was 75.0% (IC patients 78.2% and CLI patients 67.5%, p=0.118). The freedom from major amputation in both cohorts was 100%. In both IC and CLI patients, significant improvements were demonstrated at 1 year in the Rutherford category, walking distance, and quality of life in comparison to baseline. CONCLUSION This study indicates that directional atherectomy in popliteal arteries leads to favorable technical and clinical results at 1 year for claudicant as well as CLI patients.","Rastan, Aljoscha; McKinsey, James F; Garcia, Lawrence A; Rocha-Singh, Krishna J; Jaff, Michael R; Harlin, Stuart; Kamat, Suraj; Janzer, Sean; Zeller, Thomas",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,26,27

However, there is currently no evidence to support the speculation. The authors hypothesized that opioid-free balanced anesthetic with dexmedetomidine reduces postoperative opioid-related adverse events compared with balanced anesthetic with remifentanil. METHODS Patients were randomized to receive a standard balanced anesthetic with either intraoperative remifentanil plus morphine (remifentanil group) or dexmedetomidine (opioid-free group). All patients received intraoperative propofol, desflurane, dexamethasone, lidocaine infusion, ketamine infusion, neuromuscular blockade, and postoperative lidocaine infusion, paracetamol, nefopam, and patient-controlled morphine. The primary outcome was a composite of postoperative opioid-related adverse events (hypoxemia, ileus, or cognitive dysfunction) within the first 48 h after extubation. The main secondary outcomes were episodes of postoperative pain, opioid consumption, and postoperative nausea and vomiting. RESULTS The study was stopped prematurely because of five cases of severe bradycardia in the dexmedetomidine group. The primary composite outcome occurred in 122 of 156 (78%) dexmedetomidine group patients compared with 105 of 156 (67%) in the remifentanil group (relative risk, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.33; P = 0.031). Hypoxemia occurred 110 of 152 (72%) of dexmedetomidine group and 94 of 155 (61%) of remifentanil group patients (relative risk, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.40; P = 0.030). There were no differences in ileus or cognitive dysfunction. Cumulative 0 to 48 h postoperative morphine consumption (11 mg [5 to 21] versus 6 mg [0 to 17]) and postoperative nausea and vomiting (58 of 157 [37%] versus 37 of 157 [24%]; relative risk, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.90) were both less in the dexmedetomidine group, whereas measures of analgesia were similar in both groups. Dexmedetomidine patients had more delayed extubation and prolonged postanesthesia care unit stay. CONCLUSIONS This trial refuted the hypothesis that balanced opioid-free anesthesia with dexmedetomidine, compared with remifentanil, would result in fewer postoperative opioid-related adverse events. Conversely, it did result in a greater incidence of serious adverse events, especially hypoxemia and bradycardia.

In addition, sepsis survival patients also exhibit a very high death rate after hospital discharge compared to patients with any other disease. The addressed question is then: why septic patients remain ill after hospital discharge? The cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the high rate of septic patient deaths are still unknown. We described herein the studies that investigated the percentage of septic patients that died after hospital discharge ranging from 90 days up to 5 years. We also reported the symptoms of septic patients after hospital discharge and the development of the recently called post-sepsis syndrome (PSS). The most common symptoms of the PSS are cognitive disabilities, physical functioning decline, difficulties in performing routine daily activities, and poor life quality. The PSS also associates with quite often reinfection and re-hospitalization. This condition is the cause of the high rate of death mentioned above. We reported the proportion of patients dying after hospital discharge up to 5 years of followed up and the PSS symptoms associated. The authors also discuss the possible cellular and metabolic reprogramming mechanisms related with the low survival of septic patients and the occurrence of PSS.","Gritte, Raquel Bragante; Souza-Siqueira, Talita; Curi, Rui; Machado, Marcel Cerqueira Cesar; Soriano, Francisco Garcia",Frontiers in immunology,26,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a prospective cohort study involving 88 consecutive patients who underwent RARP. These patients were categorized into the barbed suture group (n = 50) and the nonbarbed suture group (n = 38). Urethral and periurethral damages determined by magnetic resonance imaging at nine months after RARP were compared using generalized linear models. The International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), quality of life (QOL) index, uroflowmetry, and the 1-h pad test were measured at baseline and at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after RARP. The findings were analyzed using mixed-effects models. Confounding was adjusted for using propensity score covariate adjustment. RESULTS The likelihood of having Grade 2/3 urethral and periurethral damages was greater in the barbed suture group than in the nonbarbed suture group (adjusted risk ratios: 2.98 and 3.85, respectively). IPSS, QOL index, and urinary leakage transiently increased at one month after RARP in both groups. QOL index was higher in the barbed suture group than in the nonbarbed suture group at 1, 9, and 12 months (P = 0.023, P = 0.025, and P = 0.011, respectively). The barbed suture group had significantly more cases of urinary incontinence than the nonbarbed suture group at 3 months (P = 0.041). Other outcomes were comparable between the two groups at all time points. CONCLUSIONS This cohort study showed that, after RARP, barbed sutures during VUA induced more severe tissue damage as determined by MRI and greater transient aggravation of QOL and continence function than nonbarbed sutures. The present findings suggest that using nonbarbed sutures during VUA may facilitate earlier acquisition of urinary QOL and urinary continence.","Haga, Nobuhiro; Kurita, Noriaki; Yanagida, Tomohiko; Ogawa, Soichiro; Yabe, Michihiro; Akaihata, Hidenori; Hata, Junya; Sato, Yuichi; Ishibashi, Kei; Hasegawa, Osamu; Kojima, Yoshiyuki",Surgical endoscopy,26,27

Therefore, an approach to prevent RLN paralysis is necessary. The present study was designed to determine the technical usability of the new hybrid pencil type energy (NP) device developed by Olympus Corporation (Tokyo, Japan) and compare it with a conventional electrosurgical knife (EK) for resection around the RLN lymph nodes. METHODS This nonsurvival (acute) study included 10 pigs (20 RLNs) and investigated the threshold for thermal RLN damage with the NP device and a conventional EK. To obtain basic information for our study, a preliminary experiment for heat spread was performed. RESULTS When using the EK device, the amplitude value disappeared at a distance of 1 mm from the RLN, but when using the NP device, the amplitude value was maintained up to a distance of 0.5 mm. There were significant differences at distances of 0 mm, 0.5 mm, and 1 mm between the NP and EK devices. Furthermore, heat spread was lower with the NP device than with the EK device. CONCLUSIONS The new energy device developed by Olympus Corporation was found to be technically safe for resection of the RLN lymph nodes in a porcine model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the potential advantages of using this new energy device in a clinical aspect.","Takeuchi, Masashi; Kawakubo, Hirofumi; Abe, Yuta; Kanazawa, Akishige; Ehara, Kazuhisa; Kinugasa, Yusuke; Kinoshita, Takahiro; Nomura, Akinari; Kitagawa, Yuko",Surgical innovation,26,31

However, the outcomes of nonoperative therapy are poorly described, and there is a lack of quality evidence to define the optimal intervention. Purpose To perform a comprehensive review of the literature and assess the quality of studies presenting patient outcomes from nonoperative interventions for patellar dislocations. Study Design Systematic review; Level of evidence, 4. Methods The MEDLINE, AMED, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, PEDro, and SPORTDiscus electronic databases were searched through July 2017 by 3 independent reviewers. The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines were followed. Study quality was assessed using the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards for Reporting Trials) criteria for randomized controlled trials and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for cohort studies and case series. Results A total of 25 studies met our inclusion criteria, including 12 randomized controlled trials, 7 cohort studies, and 6 case series, consisting of 1066 patients. Studies were grouped according to 4 broad categories of nonoperative interventions based on immobilization, weightbearing status, quadriceps exercise type, and alternative therapies. The most commonly used outcome measure was the Kujala score, and the pooled redislocation rate was 31%. Conclusion This systematic review found that patient-reported outcomes consistently improved after all methods of treatment but did not return to normal. Redislocation rates were high and close to the redislocation rates reported in natural history studies.

Here, we used information on the substrate specificity of bafinivirus 3C-like proteases to express WBV ExoN in an active form in Escherichia coli. The 374-residue protein displayed robust 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease activity in the presence of Mg2+ ions and, unlike its coronavirus homologues, did not require a protein cofactor for activity. Characterization of mutant forms of ExoN provided support for predictions on putative active-site and conserved zinc-binding residues. WBV ExoN was revealed to be most active on double-stranded RNA substrates containing one or two non-paired 3'-terminal nucleotides, supporting its presumed role in increasing the fidelity of the bafinivirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.","Durzynska, Izabela; Sauerwald, Marc; Karl, Nadja; Madhugiri, Ramakanth; Ziebuhr, John",The Journal of general virology,26,7

Thus, exposure to environmental, nutritional, chemical, and other xenobiotic factors affecting signaling events during critical organizational periods can alter the normal course of uterine development with lasting consequences. In this chapter, we provide an experimental protocol to evaluate the development of the rat uterus as a toxicity biomarker at two different developmental time points: (1) the neonatal period, on postnatal day (PND) 8, and (2) the prepubertal period, on PND21. In this experimental approach, we propose to assess: (1) uterine morphology and cytodifferentiation, (2) uterine cell proliferation, and (3) the expression of proteins involved in uterine organogenetic differentiation. All these morphological and molecular markers are useful tools to determine the consequences of exposure to toxicants with the potential to disrupt the uterine development.","Guerrero Schimpf, Marlise; Milesi, María M; Luque, Enrique H; Varayoud, Jorgelina",Methods in molecular biology,26,28

Such management should be applied in high-risk patients age > 50 years or with one or more medical problems including cardiovascular disease. We evaluated a total of 922 outpatients from March to September 2020. All patients underwent contemporary real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay tests from anterior nasal swab samples. Patients age 50.5 ± 13.7 years (range 12 to 89), 61.6% women, at moderate or high risk for COVID-19 received empiric management via telemedicine. At least two agents with antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 (zinc, hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin) and one antibiotic (azithromycin, doxycycline, ceftriaxone) were used along with inhaled budesonide and/or intramuscular dexamethasone consistent with the emergent science on early COVID-19 treatment. For patients with high severity of symptoms, urgent in-clinic administration of albuterol nebulizer, inhaled budesonide, and intravenous volume expansion with supplemental parenteral thiamine 500 mg, magnesium sulfate 4 grams, folic acid 1 gram, vitamin B12 1 mg. A total of 320/922 (34.7%) were treated resulting in 6/320 (1.9%) and 1/320 (0.3%) patients that were hospitalized and died, respectively. We conclude that early ambulatory (not hospitalized, treated at home), multidrug therapy is safe, feasible, and associated with low rates of hospitalization and death. Early treatment should be considered for high-risk patients as an emergency measure while we await randomized trials and guidelines for ambulatory management.","Procter, Brian C; Ross, Casey; Pickard, Vanessa; Smith, Erica; Hanson, Cortney; McCullough, Peter A",Reviews in cardiovascular medicine,26,31

As a consequence, mesh fixation using glue instead of sutures has become popular. This meta-analysis aimed to clarify which fixation technique is to be preferred for elective Lichtenstein inguinal hernia repair. METHODS A meta-analysis was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines. Articles published between January 1990 and April 2012 were searched for in MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Library. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing glue and sutured mesh fixation in elective Lichtenstein repair for unilateral inguinal hernia were included. The quality of the RCTs and the potential risk of bias were assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. RESULTS Of 254 papers found in the initial search, a meta-analysis was conducted of seven RCTs comprising 1185 patients. With the use of glue mesh fixation, the duration of operation was shorter (mean difference -2·57 (95 per cent confidence interval (c.i.) -4·88 to -0·26) min; P = 0·03), patients had lower visual analogue scores for postoperative pain (mean difference -0·75 (-1·18 to -0·33); P = 0·001), early chronic pain occurred less often (risk ratio 0·52, 95 per cent c.i. 0·31 to 0·87; P = 0·01), and time to return to daily activities was shorter (mean difference -1·17 (-2·30 to -0·03) days; P = 0·04). The hernia recurrence rate did not differ significantly. CONCLUSION Elective Lichtenstein repair for inguinal hernia using glue mesh fixation compared with sutures is faster and less painful, with comparable hernia recurrence rates.","de Goede, B; Klitsie, P J; van Kempen, B J H; Timmermans, L; Jeekel, J; Kazemier, G; Lange, J F",The British journal of surgery,26,12

Obeticholic acid (OCA) is a potent farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist approved for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis. We investigated the efficacy and safety of OCA in patients with PSC. METHODS AESOP was a phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-finding study. Eligible patients were 18 to 75 years of age with a diagnosis of PSC and serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) ≥2×ULN and total bilirubin <2.5×ULN. Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to receive placebo, OCA 1.5-3 mg, or OCA 5-10 mg once daily for a 24-week double-blind phase followed by a 2-year, long-term safety extension (LTSE). Primary endpoints were change in ALP from baseline to week 24, and safety. RESULTS The intent-to-treat population comprised 76 patients randomized to placebo (n=25), OCA 1.5-3 mg (n=25), and OCA 5-10 mg (n=26). At week 24, serum ALP was significantly reduced with OCA 5-10 mg vs. placebo: least-square (LS) mean difference = ‒83.4 (standard error [SE]=40.3) U/L, 95% CI: -164.28, -2.57; p=0.043. Serum ALP was not significantly reduced with OCA 1.5-3 mg vs. placebo at week 24 (LS mean [SE] difference = -78.29 [41.81] U/L, 95% CI: -162.08, 5.50; p=0.067). Total bilirubin remained comparable to baseline in all groups. The most common treatment-emergent adverse event was dose-related pruritus (placebo, 46%; OCA 1.5-3 mg, 60%; OCA 5-10 mg, 67%). Reductions in ALP were maintained during the LTSE, and no new safety signals emerged. CONCLUSIONS Treatment with OCA 5-10 mg reduced serum ALP in patients with PSC. Mild to moderate dose-related pruritus was the most common adverse event.","Kowdley, Kris V; Vuppalanchi, Raj; Levy, Cynthia; Floreani, Annarosa; Andreone, Pietro; LaRusso, Nicholas F; Shrestha, Roshan; Trotter, James; Goldberg, David; Rushbrook, Simon; Hirschfield, Gideon M; Schiano, Thomas; Jin, Yuying; Pencek, Richard; MacConell, Leigh; Shapiro, David; Bowlus, Christopher L",Journal of hepatology,26,28

BACKGROUND Regulatory investigations of health system failures highlight non-adherence to clinical guidelines and standards resulting in deficiencies in nursing care delivery. Limited attention has been paid to measuring nursing care processes particularly in the care of older people. Quality care process metrics can facilitate measurement of nurse sensitive measures of care. DESIGN A scoping literature review and modified Delphi-Consensus Technique. METHODS A scoping review of literature published between January 2007 - January 2017 was conducted to identify nursing process metrics and indicators. The Delphi-Consensus phase incorporated a four-round electronic survey of 404 nurses and a consensus meeting with 13 stakeholders working in Older Persons Care Settings in Ireland. FINDINGS From the review, 33 potential metrics were identified. After all Delphi survey rounds, 20 metrics and 90 associated indicators were selected by the nurses. Following the consensus meeting, 19 metrics and 80 indicators were included in the final suite of nursing quality care process metrics and indicators. CONCLUSION Developing this suite of Nursing Quality Care Process Metrics and Indicators for use in Older Persons Care Settings provided consensus on what nursing processes should be measured to improve the quality and safety of care delivery. IMPACT The nursing processes identified, provide a framework for future research and educational programmes in the care of older persons. Although conducted in the Irish healthcare system, there is potential for adoption or adaption in other healthcare settings. This article is protected by copyright.

Despite the convincing effect of CRT, 30-40% of patients do not respond. Among the most important correctable causes of non-response to CRT is non-optimal LV lead position. METHODS We will enroll 122 patients in this patient-blinded and assessor-blinded, randomized, clinical trial aiming to investigate if implanting the LV lead guided by electrical mapping towards the latest LV activation as compared with imaging-guided implantation, causes an excess increase in left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (LVEF). The patients are randomly assigned to either the intervention group: preceded by cardiac computed tomography of the cardiac venous anatomy, the LV lead is placed according to the latest LV activation in the coronary sinus (CS) branches identified by systematic electrical mapping of the CS at implantation and post-implant optimization of the interventricular pacing delay; or patients are assigned to the control group: placement of the LV lead guided by cardiac imaging. The LV lead is targeted towards the latest mechanical LV activation as identified by echocardiography and outside myocardial scar as identified by myocardial perfusion (MP) imaging. The primary endpoint is change in LVEF at 6-month follow up (6MFU) as compared with baseline measured by two-dimensional echocardiography. Secondary endpoints include relative percentage reduction in LV end-systolic volume, all-cause mortality, hospitalization for heart failure, and a clinical combined endpoint of response to CRT at 6MFU defined as the patient being alive, not hospitalized for heart failure, and experiencing improvement in NYHA functional class or/and > 10% increase in 6-minute walk test. DISCUSSION We assume an absolute increase in LVEF of 12% in the intervention group versus 8% in the control group. If an excess increase in LVEF can be achieved by LV lead implantation guided by electrical mapping, this study supports the conduct of larger trials investigating the impact of this strategy for LV-lead implantation on clinical outcomes in patients treated with CRT.

Several cases from the United States and Europe have been recently published, in addition to multiple ongoing clinical trials in the United States and West Africa. Even more recently, convalescent plasma has been used for treatment of individuals with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. SUMMARY Although the first reports of successful treatment with passive immune therapy date back to the early 1900s, convalescent plasma has materialized as a possible therapy for patients who develop infection from one of the emerging infectious diseases such as EVD or MERS-CoV, although the efficacy of such therapy has yet to be proven in clinical trials.","Winkler, Anne M; Koepsell, Scott A",Current opinion in hematology,26,10

The aim of this study was to assess the added value of p53 immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the homogeneity within a group of dedicated gastrointestinal (GI) pathologists. METHODS AND RESULTS Sixty-single haematoxylin and eosin (HE) slide referral BO cases [20 low-grade dysplasia (LGD); 20 high-grade dysplasia (HGD); and 20 non-dysplastic BO reference cases] were digitalised and independently assessed twice in random order by 10 dedicated GI pathologists. After a 'wash-out' period, cases were reassessed with the addition of a corresponding p53 IHC slide. Outcomes were: (i) proportion of 'indefinite for dysplasia' (IND) diagnoses; (ii) interobserver agreement; and (iii) diagnostic accuracy as compared with a consensus 'gold standard' diagnosis defined at an earlier stage by five core expert BO pathologists after their assessment of this case set. Addition of p53 IHC decreased the mean proportion of IND diagnoses from 10 of 60 to eight of 60 (P = 0.071). Mean interobserver agreement increased significantly from 0.45 to 0.57 (P = 0.0021). The mean diagnostic accuracy increased significantly from 72% to 82% (P = 0.0072) after p53 IHC addition. CONCLUSION Addition of p53 IHC significantly improves the histological assessment of BO biopsies, even within a group of dedicated GI pathologists. It decreases the proportion of IND diagnoses, and increases interobserver agreement and diagnostic accuracy. This justifies the use of accessory p53 IHC within our upcoming national digital review panel for BO biopsy cases.","van der Wel, Myrtle J; Duits, Lucas C; Pouw, Roos E; Seldenrijk, Cornelis A; Offerhaus, G J A; Visser, Mike; Ten Kate, Fiebo J; Biermann, Katharina; Brosens, Lodewijk A A; Doukas, Michael; Huysentruyt, Clement; Karrenbeld, Arend; Kats-Ugurlu, Gursah; van der Laan, Jaap S; van Lijnschoten, G Ineke; Moll, Freek C P; Ooms, Ariadne H A G; van der Valk, Hans; Tijssen, Jan G; Bergman, Jacques J; Meijer, Sybren L",Histopathology,26,12

The aim of this study was to evaluate the results of LA with a transperitoneal anterior approach for right adrenal lesions and either a transperitoneal anterior or transperitoneal anterior submesocolic approach for the left-sided lesions. METHODS The study is a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data. From January 1994 to December 2012, 393 patients underwent LA, 117 of these for an AI. Sixty-seven (57.26 %) and 50 (42.73 %) patients underwent right and left adrenalectomy, respectively. The transperitoneal anterior approach was used in all 67 patients with right lesions (57.26 %) (group A) and in 13 patients with left-sided lesions (11.11 %) (group B). The transperitoneal anterior submesocolic approach was used in the remaining 37 left-sided lesions (31.62 %) (group C). RESULTS Mean operative time in groups A, B, and C was 104.6 min (range 35-255), 148.9 min (range 80-210), and 82.7 min (range 45-230), respectively. One right and one left anterior LA (1.7 %) were converted to open surgery. There were one major and one minor complications (1.7 %). The mean lesion size was 4.73 cm (range 1-10 cm). Mean hospital stay was 3.6 days. CONCLUSIONS With adequate experience, LA with a transperitoneal anterior approach for AI is a safe and effective procedure. Early control of the adrenal vein with minimal gland manipulation and limited surgical dissection are its major advantages. In case of left LA, the submesocolic approach reduces the operative time significantly.","Paganini, Alessandro M; Guerrieri, Mario; Balla, Andrea; Quaresima, Silvia; Isidori, Andrea M; Iafrate, Franco; D'Ambrosio, Giancarlo; Lezoche, Giovanni; Lezoche, Emanuele",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,26,1

We examined the predictors for help-seeking duration in adult-onset psychosis Chinese patients in Hong Kong. We hypothesized that factors which are more related to the illness manifestation would be predictive of waiting time before any help-seeking initiation, and factors which are more related to one's knowledge about mental health services would be predictive of help-seeking duration. METHODS First-episode patients with psychosis were recruited from the Jockey Club Early Psychosis project. They were asked to report retrospectively all help-seeking behaviors involved since their first occurrence of psychotic symptoms until receipt of effective psychiatric treatment. Baseline characteristics, pre-morbid functioning and traits, and mode of illness onset were assessed. RESULTS Help-seeking pattern was analyzed in 360 patients who had subsequently reached the psychiatric services. They had an average of 2.5 help-seeking contacts. Nearly half of the first help-seeking process was initiated by family members. Only 1 % approached priests or traditional healers as the first step in help-seeking. Whereas a gradual mode of onset was significantly associated with longer waiting time to first help-seeking initiation, more premorbid schizoid and schizotypal traits and a migrant status were related to longer help-seeking duration. CONCLUSIONS Current findings suggested that family members were the key decision makers in initiating help-seeking. Longer help-seeking duration in migrants has significant implications to both local and global mental health policy.","Hui, Christy L M; Tang, Jennifer Y M; Wong, Gloria H Y; Chang, W C; Chan, Sherry K W; Lee, Edwin H M; Chen, Eric Y H",Social psychiatry and psychiatric epidemiology,26,19

SCTRs can be found in a variety of tissues and organs across species, including the pancreas, stomach, liver, heart, lung, colon, kidney, and brain. Beyond that, modulation of SCTR-mediated signaling has therapeutic potential for the treatment of multiple diseases, such as heart failure, obesity, and diabetes. However, no ligands other than secretin and its peptide analogs have been described to regulate SCTRs, probably due to inherent challenges in family B GPCR drug discovery. Here we report creation of a testing funnel that allowed targeted detection of SCTR small-molecule activators. Pursuing the strategy to identify positive allosteric modulators (PAMs), we established a unique primary screening assay employing a mixture of three orthosteric stimulators that was compared in a screening campaign testing 12,000 small-molecule compounds. Beyond that, we developed a comprehensive set of secondary assays, such as a radiolabel-free target engagement assay and a NanoBiT (NanoLuc Binary Technology)-based approach to detect β-arrestin-2 recruitment, all feasible in a high-throughput environment as well as capable of profiling ligands and hits regarding their effect on binding and receptor function.

As a core component, flexible conductive materials with skin-like properties are desirable and valuable for the development of flexible electronics. However, the integration of skin-like mechanical properties, inherent self-healing ability, ultrahigh sensitivity, and electrical conductivity into one material is difficult to be realized. Here, this study reports a kind of conductive film (PAM-dc-fGO) fabricated by cross-linking intrinsic self-repair polyazomethine (PAM) and ethylenediamine-functionalized graphene oxide (fGO) through dynamic covalent bonds (imine bonds, -CH═N-). The as-prepared conductive films exhibit skin-like mechanical properties with a stretchability of 212-275% and elastic moduli of 0.76-4.23 MPa. In addition, the healing efficiency in mechanical properties of the 24 h healed specimen can restore up to 99%, and the healing efficiency in terms of electrical conductivity still maintains above 95% after five breaking/healing cycles, indicating an excellent capability of self-repair. Due to the ultrahigh sensing sensitivity with the gauge factor (GF) of 641, the PAM-dc-fGO film-based strain sensor can precisely detect the weak signals from the human body. Moreover, the remote monitoring of human motions with a long distance of about 100 cm has been successfully conducted by a PAM-dc-fGO proximity sensor. This work provides a new path for the development of multifunctional soft materials, and the sensors show great potential in health diagnoses and security protection applications.","Du, Yuzhang; Yu, Guanxiong; Dai, Xingyi; Wang, Xudong; Yao, Bin; Kong, Jie",ACS applied materials & interfaces,26,1

The total number of COVID-19 tests was 76,717,728 and total recovered COVID-19 cases was 5,273,201. Results show an overall decline in the 7-day average change of new COVID-19 cases and new COVID-19 fatality. States such as Maharashtra, Chandigarh, Puducherry, Goa, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh continue to have high COVID-19 infectivity rate. DISCUSSION Findings highlight need for both national guidelines combined with state specific recommendations to help manage the spread of COVD-19. CONCLUSION The heterogeneity represented in India in terms of its geography and various population groups highlight the need of state specific approach to monitor and combat the ongoing pandemic. This would further facilitate the tailored approach for each state to mitigate and contain the spread of the disease.","Joshi, Ashish; Kaur, Harpreet; Krishna, L Nandini; Sharma, Shruti; Sharda, Gautam; Lohra, Garima; Bhatt, Ashruti; Grover, Ashoo",Online journal of public health informatics,26,28

Adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with cancer are particularly vulnerable. Financial burden measures exist but have varying evidence for their validity and reliability. The goal of this systematic review is to summarize and evaluate measures of financial burden in cancer and describe their potential utility among AYAs and their caregivers. To this end, the authors searched PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, CINAHL, and PsycINFO for concepts involving financial burden, cancer, and self-reported questionnaires and limited the results to the English language. They discarded meeting abstracts, editorials, letters, and case reports. The authors used standard screening and evaluation procedures for selecting and coding studies, including consensus-based standards for documenting measurement properties and study quality. In all, they screened 7250 abstracts and 720 full-text articles to identify relevant articles on financial burden. Eighty-six articles met the inclusion criteria. Data extraction revealed 64 unique measures for assessing financial burden across material, psychosocial, or behavioral domains. One measure was developed specifically for AYAs, and none were developed for their caregivers. The psychometric evidence and study qualities revealed mixed evidence of methodological rigor. In conclusion, several measures assess the financial burden of cancer. Measures were primarily designed and evaluated in adult patient populations with little focus on AYAs or caregivers despite their increased risk of financial burden. These findings highlight opportunities to adapt and test existing measures of financial burden for AYAs and their caregivers.","Salsman, John M; Danhauer, Suzanne C; Moore, Justin B; Ip, Edward H; McLouth, Laurie E; Nightingale, Chandylen L; Cheung, Christabel K; Bingen, Kristin M; Tucker-Seeley, Reginald D; Little-Greene, Denisha; Howard, Dianna S; Reeve, Bryce B",Cancer,26,12

Prediction of T cell and B cell epitopes, antigen processing analysis, antigenicity analysis, population coverage, conservancy analysis, allergenicity assessment, toxicity prediction, and protein-peptide docking are important steps in the process of designing and developing potent vaccines against various viruses and cancers. In order to perform all of analyses, several bioinformatics tools and online web servers have been developed. Scientists must take the decision to apply more suitable and precise servers for each part based on their accuracy. AREAS COVERED In this review, a wide-range list of different bioinformatics tools and online web servers has been provided. Moreover, some studies were proposed to show the importance of various bioinformatics tools for predicting and developing efficient vaccines against different pathogens including viruses, bacteria, parasites and fungi as well as cancer. EXPERT OPINION Immunoinformatics is the best way to find potential vaccine candidates against different pathogens. Thus, selection of the most accurate tools is necessary to predict and develop potent preventive and therapeutic vaccines. To further evaluation of the computational and in silico vaccine design, in vitro/in vivo analyses are required to develop vaccine candidates.","Kardani, Kimia; Bolhassani, Azam; Namvar, Ali",Expert review of vaccines,26,1

In this prospective study, we aim to compare the short-term results and real costs of robotic (RDP) and laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy (LDP). METHODS From 2011 until 2016, all consecutive patients underwent minimally invasive DP were included and data were prospectively collected. Patients were assigned in two groups, RDP and LDP, according to the availability of the Da Vinci® Surgical System for our Surgical Unit. RESULTS A minimally invasive DP was performed in 38 patients with a median age of 61 years old (44-83 years old) and a BMI of 26 kg/m2 (20-31 kg/m2). RDP group (n = 15) and LDP group (n = 23) were comparable concerning demographic data, BMI, ASA score, comorbidities, malignant lesions, lesion size, and indication of spleen preservation. Median operative time was longer in RDP (207 min) compared to LDP (187 min) (p = 0.047). Conversion rate, spleen preservation failure, and perioperative transfusion rates were nil in both groups. Pancreatic fistula was diagnosed in 40 and 43% (p = 0.832) of patients and was grade A in 83 and 80% (p = 1.000) in RDP and LDP groups, respectively. Median postoperative hospital stay was similar in both groups (RDP: 8 days vs. LDP: 9 days, p = 0.310). Major complication occurred in 7% in RDP group and 13% in LDP group (p = 1.000). Ninety-days mortality was nil in both groups. No difference was found concerning R0 resection rate and median number of retrieved lymph nodes. Total cost of RDP was higher than LDP (13611 vs. 12509 €, p < 0.001). The difference between mean hospital incomes and costs was negative in RDP group contrary to LDP group (- 1269 vs. 1395 €, p = 0.040). CONCLUSION Short-term results of RDP seem to be similar to LDP but the high cost of RDP makes this approach not cost-effective actually.","Souche, Regis; Herrero, Astrid; Bourel, Guillaume; Chauvat, John; Pirlet, Isabelle; Guillon, Françoise; Nocca, David; Borie, Frederic; Mercier, Gregoire; Fabre, Jean-Michel",Surgical endoscopy,26,1

Anosmia, hypogeusia, headache, nausea and altered consciousness are commonly described, although there are emerging clinical reports of more serious and specific conditions such as acute cerebrovascular accident, encephalitis and demyelinating disease. Whether these presentations are directly due to viral invasion of the central nervous system (CNS) or caused by indirect mechanisms has yet to be established. Neuropathological examination of brain tissue at autopsy will be essential to establish the neuro-invasive potential of the SARS-CoV-2 virus but, to date, there have been few detailed studies. The pathological changes in the brain probably represent a combination of direct cytopathic effects mediated by SARS-CoV-2 replication or indirect effects due to respiratory failure, injurious cytokine reaction, reduced immune response and cerebrovascular accidents induced by viral infection. Further large-scale molecular and cellular investigations are warranted to clarify the neuropathological correlates of the neurological and psychiatric features seen clinically in COVID-19. In this review, we summarise the current reports of neuropathological examination in COVID-19 patients, in addition to our own experience, and discuss their contribution to the understanding of CNS involvement in this disease.","Al-Sarraj, Safa; Troakes, Claire; Hanley, Brian; Osborn, Michael; Richardson, Mark P; Hotopf, Matthew; Bullmore, Edward; Everall, Ian",Neuropathology and applied neurobiology,26,31

Postoperative social and behavioral support (e.g., early mobilization, mealtime assistance) may reduce the incidence and impact of delirium, and these efforts are possible with proactive patient-care programs. This pilot trial tests the hypothesis that a multicomponent decision support system, which sends automated alerts and recommendations to patient-care programs and family members for high-risk patients, will improve the postoperative environment for neurocognitive and clinical recovery. Methods: This will be a randomized, controlled, factorial pilot trial at a large academic medical center. High-risk, non-cardiac surgery patients (≥70 years old) will be recruited. Patients will be allocated to a usual care group (n=15), Hospital Elder Life Program (HELP)-based paging system (n=15), family-based paging system (n=15), or combined HELP- and family-based system (n=15). The primary outcome will be the presence of delirium, defined by positive long-form Confusion Assessment Method screening. Secondary outcomes will include additional HELP- and family-based performance metrics along with various neurocognitive and clinical recovery measures. Exploratory outcomes include the incidence of positive family-based delirium assessments post-discharge, 36-item Short Form Survey, PROMIS Cognitive Function Abilities Subset 4a, and 30-day readmission rates.

The increasing number of TB-resistant cases has contributed to this scenario. In light of this, new strategies to control and treat the disease are necessary. Our research group has previously described furoxan derivatives as promising scaffolds to be explored as new antitubercular drugs. RESULTS Two of these furoxan derivatives, (14b) and (14c), demonstrated a high selectivity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The compounds (14b) and (14c) were also active against a latent M. tuberculosis strain, with MIC90 values of 6.67 μM and 9.84 μM, respectively; they were also active against monoresistant strains (MIC90 values ranging from 0.61 to 20.42 μM) and clinical MDR strains (MIC90 values ranging from 3.09 to 42.95 μM). Time-kill experiments with compound (14c) showed early bactericidal effects that were superior to those of the first- and second-line anti-tuberculosis drugs currently used in therapy. The safety of compounds (14b) and (14c) was demonstrated by the Ames test because these molecules were not mutagenic under the tested conditions. Finally, we confirmed the safety, and high efficacy of compounds (14b) and (14c), which reduced M. tuberculosis to undetectable levels in a mouse aerosol model of infection. CONCLUSION Altogether, we have identified two advanced lead compounds, (14b) and (14c), as novel promising candidates for the treatment of TB infection.","de Souza, P C; Fernandes, G F S; Marino, L B; Ribeiro, C M; Silva, P B da; Chorilli, M; Silva, C S P; Resende, F A; Solcia, M C; de Grandis, R A; Costa, C A S; Cho, S H; Wang, Y; Franzblau, S G; Dos Santos, J L; Pavan, F R",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,26,1

METHODS Prostatic aspirated cells were obtained immediately after transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided needle biopsy. Cellular RNA such as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA, prostate specific antigen (PSA) mRNA and prostate-specific RNA (PCA3) mRNA were analyzed by using Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). PCA3 score was calculated as the ratio of PCA3 mRNA to PSA mRNA expression. Diagnostic performance of the fast-aspirated cellular RNA analysis technique for determining prostate cancer and metastatic status were evaluated by developing receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC), and the correlation between aspirated cellular RNA mRNA expressions and risk grouping was calculated, to investigate the underlying potential for PCa staging. RESULTS PCA3 score was significantly higher in prostatic aspirated cells obtained from cancerous tissues than noncancerous tissues. The median aspirated cellular PCA3 score was higher in patients with PCa compared to BPH, and presenting an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.87 (95%CI: 0.79-0.94) for PCa diagnosis. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that baseline median aspirated cellular PCA3 score (OR=9.316, 95%CI: 1.045-83.033, P<0.05) was an independent predictive factor for metastatic status in PCa patients. CONCLUSION The ease of use and minimal complexity of fast prostatic aspirated cellular RNA analysis may be a valuable diagnostic technique, providing urgent diagnostic information for accurate PCa diagnosing and staging.","Sang, Yiwen; Wang, Xuchu; Yu, Pan; Zhang, Luyan; Dai, Yibei; Zhang, Lingyu; Wang, Danhua; Liu, Zhenping; Wang, Yao; Tao, Zhihua",Translational oncology,26,7

Ex-vivo, lentiviral vectors have been used successfully in the treatment of many hematopoietic diseases in humans, as their use offers stable transgene expression due to the vector's ability to integrate into the host genome. This method demonstrates the application of ex vivo gene therapy of hepatocytes to a large animal model of hereditary tyrosinemia type I. This process consists of 1) isolation of primary hepatocytes from the autologous donor/recipient animal, 2) ex vivo gene delivery via hepatocyte transduction with a lentiviral vector, and 3) autologous transplant of corrected hepatocytes via portal vein injection. Success of the method generally relies upon efficient and sterile removal of the liver resection, careful handling of the excised specimen for isolation of viable hepatocytes sufficient for re-engrafting, high-percentage transduction of the isolated cells, and aseptic surgical procedures throughout to prevent infection. Technical failure at any of these steps will result in low yield of viable transduced hepatocytes for autologous transplant or infection of the donor/recipient animal. The pig model of human type 1 hereditary tyrosinemia (HT-1) chosen for this approach is uniquely amenable to such a method, as even a small percentage of engraftment of corrected cells will lead to repopulation of the liver with healthy cells based on a powerful selective advantage over native-diseased hepatocytes. Although this growth selection will not be true for all indications, this approach is a foundation for expansion into other indications and allows for manipulation of this environment to address additional diseases, both within the liver and beyond, while controlling for exposure to viral vector and opportunity for off-target toxicity and tumorigenicity.","Kaiser, Robert A; Mao, Shennen A; Glorioso, Jaime; Amiot, Bruce; Nicolas, Clara T; Allen, Kari L; Du, Zeji; VanLith, Caitlin J; Hickey, Raymond D; Nyberg, Scott L; Lillegard, Joseph B",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,26,1

Microwave ablation is often used in isolation or succession, and seldom in combination with resection. Potential benefits and pitfalls from combined resection and ablation therapy in patients with complex and extensive bilobar hepatic disease have not been well defined. METHODS A review of the University of Louisville prospective Hepato-Pancreatico-Biliary Patients database was performed with multi-focal bilobar disease that underwent microwave ablation with resection or microwave only included. RESULTS One hundred and eight were treated with microwave only (MWA, n = 108) or combined resection and ablation (CRA, n = 84) and were compared with similar disease-burden patients undergoing resection only (n = 84). The groups were comparable except that the MWA group was older (p = .02) and with higher co-morbidities (diabetes, hepatitis). The resection group had larger tumours (4 vs. 3.2 and 3 cm) but the CRA group had more numerous lesions (4 vs. 3 and 2, p = .002). Short-term outcomes including morbidity (47.6% vs. 43%, p = .0715) were similar between the CRA and resection only groups. Longer operative time (164 vs. 126 min, p = .003) and need for blood transfusion (p = .001) were independent predictors of complications. Survival analyses for colorectal metastasis patients (n = 158) demonstrated better overall survival (OS) (43.9 vs. 37.6 and 30.5 months, p = .035), disease-free survival (DFS) (38 vs. 26.6 and 16.9 months, p = .028) and local recurrence-free survival (LRFS) (55.4 vs. 17 and 22.9 months, p < .001) with resection only. CONCLUSION The use of microwave ablation in addition to surgical resection did not significantly increase the morbidities or short-term outcomes. In combination with systemic and other local forms of therapy, combined resection and ablation is a safe and effective procedure.","Philips, Prejesh; Scoggins, C R; Rostas, J K; McMasters, K M; Martin, R C","International journal of hyperthermia : the official journal of European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology, North American Hyperthermia Group",26,30

DESIGN Retrospective observational study. METHODS We used data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project California State Inpatient Database (2005-2011) to identify 26,878,498 admissions and 532,925 patient transfers. We constructed a weighted, directed network among the hospitals by defining an edge between 2 hospitals to be the monthly average number of patients discharged from one hospital and admitted to another on the same day. We then used a network autocorrelation model to study the effect of the patient sharing network on the monthly average number of CDI cases per hospital, and we estimated the proportion of CDI cases attributable to the network. RESULTS We found that 13% (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.6%-18%) of CDI cases were due to diffusion through the patient-sharing network. The network autocorrelation parameter was estimated at 5.0 (95% CI, 3.0-6.9). An increase in the number of patients transferred into and/or an increased CDI rate at the hospitals from which those patients originated led to an increase in the number of CDIs in the receiving hospital. CONCLUSIONS A minority but substantial burden of CDI infections are attributable to hospital transfers. A hospital's infection control may thus be nontrivially influenced by its neighboring hospitals. This work adds to the growing body of evidence that intervention strategies designed to minimize HAIs should be done at the regional rather than local level.","Sewell, Daniel K; Simmering, Jacob E; Justice, Samuel; Pemmaraju, Sriram V; Segre, Alberto M; Polgreen, Philip M",Infection control and hospital epidemiology,26,24

While many infants are infected with RSV, the nature and severity of disease vary among individuals. RSV causes bronchiolitis, pneumonia and asthma exacerbation. However, most children infected with RSV have only mild upper airways disease and may be asymptomatic.Areas covered: Despite efforts to elucidate mechanisms for the various clinical responses to RSV infection, they remain largely unknown, suggesting that susceptibility and disease are influenced by multiple intrinsic and extrinsic factors. This article reviews the available literature on the field of RSV disease severity and discusses important factors associated to susceptibility and different disease outcome.Expert opinion: The severity of RSV-induced illness is a phenomenon that depends on a variety of graded mechanisms of interaction between the host, virus, and environment. This may lead to differences in intensity of immune response in the lung and different courses of the disease. By characterizing, classifying and grading the affecting factors in high-risk patients versus those who do not fall ill by RSV, we may find therapies or point to disease-limiting medications.","Tahamtan, Alireza; Samadizadeh, Saeed; Rastegar, Mostafa; Nakstad, Britt; Salimi, Vahid",Expert review of respiratory medicine,26,26

RECENT FINDINGS Two observational studies (Cardiovascular Health in Ambulatory Care Research Team [CANHEART] and Copenhagen City Heart Study and the Copenhagen General Population Study [Copenhagen Heart Studies]) of adults without pre-existing ASCVD have shown a significant U-shaped association of HDL-C with all-cause and cause-specific mortality. Both studies showed that low HDL-C levels consistently increased hazard risk (HR) for all-cause and cause-specific mortality. In the CANHEART study, high HDL-C levels, HDL-C > 90 mg/dL, were associated with increased HR for non-CVD/non-cancer mortality. In the Copenhagen Heart Studies, women with HDL-C ≥ 135 mg/dL showed increased HR for all-cause and CVD mortality, while men with HDL-C > 97 mg/dL showed increased HR for all-cause and CVD mortality. Genetic association studies failed to show that genetic etiologies of high HDL-C significantly reduced risk for myocardial infarction (MI), while hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 (HNF4A) was significantly associated with high HDL-C and increased MI risk. Candidate gene studies have identified scavenger receptor B class I (SCARB1) and lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG3) as genes significantly associated with high HDL-C and increased MI risk. Low HDL-C remains as a significant factor for increased disease risk while high HDL-C levels are not associated with cardioprotection. Clinical CVD risk calculators need revision.","Rodriguez, Annabelle",Current atherosclerosis reports,26,1

Today, there are two clustering mechanisms which prevent of uncontrolled disease propagation in a connected network: an ""internal"" clustering, which mimics self-isolation (SI) in local naturally arranged communities, and an ""external"" clustering, which looks like a sharp frontiers closing (FC) between cities and countries, and which does not care about the natural connections of network agents. SI networks are ""evolutionarily grown"" under the condition of maximization of small cliques in the entire network, while FC networks are instantly created. Running the standard SIR model on clustered SI and FC networks, we demonstrate that the evolutionary grown clustered network prevents the spread of an epidemic better than the instantly clustered network with similar parameters. We find that SI networks have the scale-free property for the degree distribution P(k)∼k^{η}, with a small critical exponent -2<η<-1. We argue that the scale-free behavior emerges as a result of the randomness in the initial degree distributions.","Valba, O; Avetisov, V; Gorsky, A; Nechaev, S",Physical review. E,26,8

The goal of this tutorial is to disseminate skills in structure-based drug design and to allow others to unleash their own creativity to design new drugs to fight the current pandemic. The tutorial begins with the X-ray crystallographic structure of the main protease (Mpro) of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) bound to a peptide substrate and then uses the UCSF Chimera software to modify the substrate to create a cyclic peptide inhibitor within the Mpro active site. Finally, the tutorial uses the molecular docking software AutoDock Vina to show the interaction of the cyclic peptide inhibitor with both SARS-CoV Mpro and the highly homologous SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The supporting information (supplementary material) provides an illustrated step-by-step guide for the inhibitor design, to help readers design their own drug candidates for COVID-19 and the coronaviruses that will cause future pandemics.

All P-stalk proteins (uL10, P1 and P2) undergo phosphorylation within their C-termini.

The effect of these restrictions is unknown, given that beauty services are widely used for stress relief or to enhance confidence. The current study explored the relationship between engagement in appearance-focused behaviors and distress regarding beauty service closure. Participants with high and low levels of dysmorphic concern were compared to determine whether COVID-19 restrictions may affect these groups differently. METHOD An online survey was completed by 216 participants living in Australia. Questions addressed engagement in appearance-focused behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic and attitudes toward beauty service closure. The Dysmorphic Concern Questionnaire (DCQ) was used to group participants by low and high dysmorphic concern. RESULTS Appearance-focused behaviors decreased in the low DCQ group (n = 163) during the COVID-19 pandemic, while such behaviors in the high DCQ group (n = 53) remained unchanged. Individuals who were living alone, younger, reported higher dysmorphic concern and greater distress over beauty service closure engaged in more frequent appearance-focused behaviors (R2 = .57, p < .001). The high DCQ group reported greater distress over beauty service closure and increased desire to obtain future beauty treatments. DISCUSSION While COVID-19 restrictions may have provided a break from societal appearance pressure for those with low dysmorphic concern, appearance-focused behaviors persisted in individuals with high dysmorphic concern. A greater understanding of the long-term impacts on appearance-related distress is needed to determine mental health priorities emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic.","Pikoos, Toni D; Buzwell, Simone; Sharp, Gemma; Rossell, Susan L",The International journal of eating disorders,26,33

The purpose of this study was to show a correlation between poor aortic arch anatomy and perioperative ischemic complications after CAS. METHODS Our prospectively maintained database was queried for all CAS procedures performed on symptomatic patients between 2009 and 2011. Retrospective analysis of consecutive CAS procedures was performed. The primary endpoint was perioperative (within 30 days) ischemic events (stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA)). Event incidence was compared between groups dichotomized by age and anatomical features. Incidence of unfavorable arch (acute angle between aortic arch and treated common carotid artery) was compared between age groups. RESULTS Perioperative ischemic events included four ischemic strokes and three TIAs (all events ipsilateral to the treated vessel). Event incidence was more frequent in patients with unfavorable arch anatomy (7.9%) than in those with favorable aortic arch features (0.7%) (p=0.0073). Event incidence in patients ≥80 years of age (4.5%) was not statistically different than that in patients <80 years (2.3%) (p=0.428). Unfavorable aortic arch anatomy was increased in frequency in patients aged 80 years and over (<80 years, 29%; ≥80 years, 52%; p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS In the present series, the incidence of perioperative complications was increased in patients with unfavorable aortic arch anatomy but not in patients ≥80 years. CAS represents a revascularization option for patients of all ages; however, patients with unfavorable aortic arch anatomy may represent a group at relatively high risk for periprocedural ischemic events.","Dumont, Travis M; Mokin, Maxim; Wach, Michael M; Drummond, Patrick S; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Levy, Elad I; Hopkins, L Nelson",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,26,1

However, those with minimal or no bone involvement are more easily resectable because of their well-delineated margins and thus have better prognoses. Such extraosseous chordomas of the spine are localized both intradurally and extradurally. Only a few case reports have focused on extraosseous, extradural spinal chordomas. Radiologically, this type of chordoma has a dumbbell shape; however, dumbbell-shaped spinal tumors are traditionally thought to be neurogenic tumors (i.e., schwannomas or neurofibromas). We herein report a unique case involving a woman with a dumbbell-shaped extraosseous chordoma protruding predominantly into the retropharyngeal space. A 44-year-old woman presented for evaluation of a left submandibular mass. A T2-hyperintense, gadolinium-enhancing mass was found in her cervical spinal canal, protruding through the C2/3 neural foramen into the retropharyngeal space with minimal vertebral involvement. The initial diagnosis was a neurogenic tumor, most likely a schwannoma. After subtotal removal, the pathologic diagnosis was a chordoma. Because chordomas and schwannomas have significantly different prognoses, caution is warranted when a dumbbell-shaped tumor is identified in the spine with minimal or no vertebral deterioration on radiology. This report also provides the first thorough review of extraosseous dumbbell-shaped intraspinal-extraspinal chordomas.","Lee, Sun Joo; Paeng, Sung Hwa; Kang, Mi Seon; Jung, Soo Jin; Yoon, Shin Ae; Park, Ha Young; Yoon, Hye Kyoung; Yang, Young Il; Cho, Hwa Jin",The Journal of international medical research,26,1

Treatment approaches generally aim to restore glottal closure for phonation and improve vocal function. There are a wide range of voice outcome measures that are available to measure the treatment effect. Careful selection of voice outcome measures is required to ensure that they are adequate for purpose and are psychometrically sound to detect the treatment effect. This article aims to critically evaluate the literature for voice outcome measures that are used for patients with UVFP. STUDY DESIGN Systematic review. METHODS Nine databases were searched for UVFP treatment studies published since 2003 (n = 2,484 articles). These articles and their references were screened using inclusion/exclusion criteria, including population characteristics, treatment, voice outcomes, and study findings. Data from the included articles was extracted and appraised with respect to multidimensionality, timing, selection rationale, validity, reliability, and responsiveness to change of the voice outcome measures. RESULTS A total of 29 studies met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review. These studies showed considerable variability in the rationale, selection, and application of voice outcome measures for reporting the treatment effect for patients with UVFP. CONCLUSION There is currently a significant disparity in the selection and use of voice outcome measures for patients with UVFP. A set of principles around selection rationale, validity, reliability, and responsiveness to change is proposed to enhance the judicious selection of voice outcome measures for this patient group.

The patient complained of prolonged fever and coughs for 7 days which had not improved after oral treatment with sultamicillin for 5 days, prescribed by the patient's general practitioner. Physical examination showed high blood pressure due to previously known hypertension. Other vital signs without pathological findings. Pulmonary auscultation showed basal soft crackling noises of the left lung. FINDINGS AND DIAGNOSIS Laboratory examination showed increased values for LDH, pro-BNP and CRP and normal values for leucocytes and procalcitonin. Conventional X-Ray of the chest showed bipulmonal lateral atypical infiltrates. After the first PCR turned in negative another PCR-analysis for SARS-CoV-2 of a deep oral swab-sample was performed since the clinical, laboratory and radiological findings were typical for COVID-19. Again, SARS-CoV-2-RNA was not detected. A CT-scan of the chest showed bipulmonal lateral ground-glass attenuation, again typical for COVID-19 associated pneumonia. After a third attempt for a PCR-analysis of a deep oral swab-sample was negative, analysis of a sputum was performed which finally confirmed the diagnosis of COVID-19 associated pneumonia. THERAPY AND COURSE OF EVENTS The patient was admitted for evaluation of syncopes and suspect of COVID-19 associated pneumonia. The patient was prophylactically isolated while the result of SARS-CoV-2-PCR from a deep oral swab was pending. Suspecting a possible secondary bacterial infection at the beginning, intravenous antibiotic treatment with ampicillin/sulbactam was initiated. While further examinations showed no indication for bacterial infection, antibiotics were discontinued after 3 days. Due to clinical recovery antiviral therapy was not performed after confirming the diagnosis. The patient was discharged 17 days after onset of first symptoms without any requirements for further isolation. CONCLUSION This casuistic describes a case of COVID-19 associated pneumonia presenting with typical clinical features, laboratory and radiological findings. Detection of viral RNA was not successful from deep oral swab-samples despite repeated attempts. Finally, PCR-analysis of sputum confirmed the diagnosis. Analysis of deeper airway samples (sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage, tracheal secretions) or stool for SARS-CoV-2 should be performed in cases of evident clinical suspicion of COVID-19 and negative PCR results from deep oral swabs.","Hornuss, D; Laubner, K; Monasterio, C; Thimme, R; Wagner, D",Pneumologie,26,12

Given its mild initial symptoms, T2DM is often diagnosed several years after its onset, leaving half of diabetic individuals undiagnosed. While several classical clinical and genetic biomarkers have been identified, improving early diagnosis by exploring other kinds of omics data remains crucial. In this study, we have combined longitudinal data from two population-based cohorts CoLaus and DESIR (comprising in total 493 incident cases vs. 1360 controls) to identify new or confirm previously implicated metabolomic biomarkers predicting T2DM incidence more than 5 years ahead of clinical diagnosis. Our longitudinal data have shown robust evidence for valine, leucine, carnitine and glutamic acid being predictive of future conversion to T2DM. We confirmed the causality of such association for leucine by 2-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR) based on independent data. Our MR approach further identified new metabolites potentially playing a causal role on T2D, including betaine, lysine and mannose. Interestingly, for valine and leucine a strong reverse causal effect was detected, indicating that the genetic predisposition to T2DM may trigger early changes of these metabolites, which appear well-before any clinical symptoms. In addition, our study revealed a reverse causal effect of metabolites such as glutamic acid and alanine. Collectively, these findings indicate that molecular traits linked to the genetic basis of T2DM may be particularly promising early biomarkers.","Porcu, Eleonora; Gilardi, Federica; Darrous, Liza; Yengo, Loic; Bararpour, Nasim; Gasser, Marie; Marques-Vidal, Pedro; Froguel, Philippe; Waeber, Gerard; Thomas, Aurelien; Kutalik, Zoltán",Scientific reports,26,5

Though PECs provide essential documentation to position programs for successful accreditation decisions, few resources exist in the literature for PEC members. Methods Employing Kern's model for curriculum development, we conducted a needs assessment in 2016 that resulted in adding a 2-hour workshop on building and supporting effective PECs to a certificate program for residency program directors. The workshop used a flipped classroom model with prework readings and guiding questions to familiarize participants with ACGME requirements for PECs and APEs. Several activities helped participants identify best practices for PECs and discuss authentic examples of mission statements, APEs, and action plans. Results From 2017 to 2019, we offered this workshop on three different occasions to a total of 42 participants (34 residency program directors/associate program directors and eight program coordinators).

The dietary patterns of Bamiléké people were comprised of more energy-dense foods than the Béti people, regardless of the living area. The energy intake (13·8 (SD 4·6)-15·4 (SD 4·8) MJ vs 9·7 (SD 3·5)-11·2 (SD 3·9 MJ) and the obesity (15-29 % vs 5-8 %) were therefore higher in Bamiléké than in Béti respectively. Multivariable linear regression analyses showed strong associations of both ethnicities (4·02 MJ; P <0·001), living area (0·21 MJ; P <0·001), and education (0·59 MJ; P <0·048) with energy intake (EI), independently of each other and other sociodemographic factors. The ethnicity factor has been characterized as the more important determinant of diet. Our findings provide new insights and perspectives highlighting the importance of anthropological factors when building prevention campaigns against obesity in Central Africa.","Amougou, Norbert; Pasquet, Patrick; Bernard, Jonathan Y; Ponty, Amandine; Fotso, Martin; Said-Mohamed, Rihlat; Cohen, Emmanuel",The British journal of nutrition,26,33

Thus, breed-specific peculiarities can be expected, which could include haematological and biochemical measurements. Despite this, there are only a few reports on breed-specific reference intervals (RI). This information is essential in routine practice where results from individual patients are usually compared with an RI. The aim was to compare haematological and biochemical data from clinically healthy Abyssinian, Holy Birman, Norwegian Forest and Siberian cats with published RIs to assess whether the published RIs are acceptable in these breeds. Comparison with established RIs using guidelines from the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards and the American Society of Veterinary Clinical Pathology, revealed a number of breed-related clinicopathological differences. New RIs were established, but in most cases the new RIs overlapped with published RIs, and the use of the breed-specific data would minimally affect the clinical interpretation of laboratory results. Important differences that could result in misinterpretation of laboratory results were as follows: microcytosis and high α2-globulin concentrations in Abyssinian cats; high serum creatinine, α2-globulin and glucose concentrations in Holy Birman cats; high serum alkaline phosphatase activity and calcium and phosphate concentration in Norwegian Forest cats; low β2-globulin and γ-globulin concentrations in Norwegian Forest and Siberian cats. Breed-specific RIs should be used for these analytes. In addition, care should be taken in interpreting clinicopathological data in purebred cats for which specific RIs have not been established.","Paltrinieri, Saverio; Ibba, Fabrizio; Rossi, Gabriele",Journal of feline medicine and surgery,26,27

However, mesh fixation remains a matter of discussion. This study was designed to compare noninvasive fibrin-glue attachment with tack fixation of meshes developed primarily for intra-abdominal use. It was hypothesized that particular mesh structures would substantially influence detachment force. STUDY DESIGN For initial evaluation, specimens of laminated polypropylene/polydioxanone meshes were anchored to porcine abdominal walls by either helical titanium tacks or absorbable tacks in vitro. A universal tensile-testing machine was used to measure tangential detachment forces (TF). For subsequent experiments of glue fixation, polypropylene/polydioxanone mesh and 4 additional meshes with diverse particular mesh structure, ie, polyvinylidene fluoride/polypropylene mesh, a titanium-coated polypropylene mesh, a polyester mesh bonded with a resorbable collagen, and a macroporous condensed PTFE mesh were evaluated. RESULTS TF tests revealed that fibrin-glue attachment was not substantially different from that achieved with absorbable tacks (median TF 7.8 Newton [N], range 1.3 to 15.8 N), but only when certain open porous meshes (polyvinylidene fluoride/polypropylene mesh: median 6.2 N, range 3.4 to 10.3 N; titanium-coated polypropylene mesh: median 5.2 N, range 2.1 to 11.7 N) were used. Meshes coated by an anti-adhesive barrier (polypropylene/polydioxanone mesh: median 3.1 N, range 1.7 to 5.8 N; polyester mesh bonded with a resorbable collagen: median 1.3 N, range 0.5 to 1.9 N), or the condensed PTFE mesh (median 3.1 N, range 2.1 to 7.0 N) provided a significantly lower TF (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Fibrin glue appears to be an appealing noninvasive option for mesh fixation in laparoscopic ventral hernia repair, but only if appropriate meshes are used. Glue can also serve as an adjunct to mechanical fixation to reduce the number of invasive tacks.","Rieder, Erwin; Stoiber, Martin; Scheikl, Verena; Poglitsch, Marcus; Dal Borgo, Andrea; Prager, Gerhard; Schima, Heinrich",Journal of the American College of Surgeons,26,15

Our article aims of comparing and interpreting between-country trends of mortality rate, case-fatality and all-cause excess mortality. METHODS We used data from open databases (Our World in Data mostly) for comparing mortality of eleven western countries (Austria, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, UK, USA). Between-country trends in mortality rate and case-fatality (both including deaths for COVID-19 as numerator and therefore labelled as COVID-19 mortality metrics) and all-cause excess mortality (i.e. observed deaths during the epidemic compared with those expected based on mortality in the same periods of previous years) were compared. RESULTS Although Belgium ranks first in mortality from COVID-19 (possibly due to the broadest criterion for attributing a death to COVID-19), it does not rank first for all-cause excess mortality. Conversely, compared with Belgium, the UK, Italy and Spain have reported lower COVID-19 mortality (possibly due to the narrower definitions for a COVID-19 death) but higher all-cause excess mortality. Germany and Austria are the unique countries for which COVID-19 mortality, case-fatality and all-cause excess mortality consistently exhibited the lowest rates. CONCLUSION Between-country heterogeneity of COVID-19 mortality metrics could be largely explained by differences of criteria for attributing a death to COVID-19; in age/comorbidity structures; in policies for identifying asymptomatic people affected from SARS-CoV-2 infection. All-cause excess mortality is recommended as a more reliable metric for comparing countries.","Corrao, Giovanni; Rea, Federico; Blangiardo, Gian Carlo",Journal of hypertension,26,5

Such coding is usually done manually in hospitals but could potentially be automated to improve the efficiency and accuracy of medical coding. Recent studies on deep learning for automated medical coding achieved promising performances. However, the explainability of these models is usually poor, preventing them to be used confidently in supporting clinical practice. Another limitation is that these models mostly assume independence among labels, ignoring the complex correlations among medical codes which can potentially be exploited to improve the performance. METHODS To address the issues of model explainability and label correlations, we propose a Hierarchical Label-wise Attention Network (HLAN), which aimed to interpret the model by quantifying importance (as attention weights) of words and sentences related to each of the labels. Secondly, we propose to enhance the major deep learning models with a label embedding (LE) initialisation approach, which learns a dense, continuous vector representation and then injects the representation into the final layers and the label-wise attention layers in the models. We evaluated the methods using three settings on the MIMIC-III discharge summaries: full codes, top-50 codes, and the UK NHS (National Health Service) COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) shielding codes. Experiments were conducted to compare the HLAN model and label embedding initialisation to the state-of-the-art neural network based methods, including variants of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). RESULTS HLAN achieved the best Micro-level AUC and F1 on the top-50 code prediction, 91.9% and 64.1%, respectively; and comparable results on the NHS COVID-19 shielding code prediction to other models: around 97% Micro-level AUC. More importantly, in the analysis of model explanations, by highlighting the most salient words and sentences for each label, HLAN showed more meaningful and comprehensive model interpretation compared to the CNN-based models and its downgraded baselines, HAN and HA-GRU. Label embedding (LE) initialisation significantly boosted the previous state-of-the-art model, CNN with attention mechanisms, on the full code prediction to 52.5% Micro-level F1. The analysis of the layers initialised with label embeddings further explains the effect of this initialisation approach. The source code of the implementation and the results are openly available at https://github.com/acadTags/Explainable-Automated-Medical-Coding. CONCLUSION We draw the conclusion from the evaluation results and analyses. First, with hierarchical label-wise attention mechanisms, HLAN can provide better or comparable results for automated coding to the state-of-the-art, CNN-based models. Second, HLAN can provide more comprehensive explanations for each label by highlighting key words and sentences in the discharge summaries, compared to the n-grams in the CNN-based models and the downgraded baselines, HAN and HA-GRU. Third, the performance of deep learning based multi-label classification for automated coding can be consistently boosted by initialising label embeddings that captures the correlations among labels. We further discuss the advantages and drawbacks of the overall method regarding its potential to be deployed to a hospital and suggest areas for future studies.","Dong, Hang; Suárez-Paniagua, Víctor; Whiteley, William; Wu, Honghan",Journal of biomedical informatics,26,1

Embase, PubMed, and Cochrane Library were searched for randomized controlled trials that enrolled patients with overweight or obesity on a ketogenic diet for metabolic control. Fourteen studies were included in meta-analysis. The effects of ketogenic diets on glycemic control were greater for diabetic patients relative to those of low-fat diets, indicated by lower glycated hemoglobin (SMD, -0.62; p < 0.001) and homeostatic model assessment index (SMD, -0.29; p = 0.02), while comparable effects were observed for nondiabetic patients. Ketogenic diets led to substantial weight reduction (SMD, -0.46; p = 0.04) irrespective of patients' diabetes status at baseline and improved lipid profiles in terms of lower triglyceride (SMD, -0.45; p = 0.01) and greater high-density lipoprotein (SMD, 0.31; p = 0.005) for diabetic patients. Other risk markers showed no substantial between-group difference post intervention. Our study findings confirmed that ketogenic diets were more effective in improving metabolic parameters associated with glycemic, weight, and lipid controls in patients with overweight or obesity, especially those with preexisting diabetes, as compared to low-fat diets.

Genotype-based personalised nutrition advice may improve nutrition knowledge and enhance behaviour change towards better diet quality compared with conventional recommendations. AIM To investigate the nutrition knowledge, food choices and diet quality in genotyped and non-genotyped individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS One hundred and twenty-three healthy UK adults were recruited using convenience sampling through social networks. The online questionnaire consisted of the General Nutrition Knowledge Questionnaire, the Food Choices Questionnaire, and the EPIC-Norfolk Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ). FFQ was used to calculate participant diet quality with the Diet Quality Index-International and socio-demographic and anthropometric data. RESULTS Median general nutrition knowledge, diet variety and diet balance scores were higher in genotyped compared with non-genotyped individuals (71.0 ± 11.0 vs. 61.0 ± 15.0, p = <.001, 18.00 ± 5.00 vs. 15.00 ± 5.00, p = .007 and 2.00 ± 4.00 vs. 0.00 ± 2.00, p = .025, respectively).

CONCLUSIONS Nutrition knowledge and diet quality indices of balance and variety were higher among genotyped compared with non-genotyped individuals; overall diet quality was similar between groups.

One-lung ventilation was employed to improve the acoustic window and protect the lung and diaphragm. If the one-lung ventilation was unsuccessful, artificial pleural effusion was added. The technical efficacy was confirmed by contrast-enhanced computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (CT/MRI) 1 month later. After that, CT/MRI was performed every 3-6 months.Results: Among the enrolled patients, the technical success rate of one lung ventilation was 92.2% (59/64). The visibility scores of tumors were improved significantly after one-lung ventilation compared to those before one-lung ventilation (p < .001). Finally, 78.6% (55/70) of the tumors achieved clinical success of one-lung ventilation to become clearly visible and underwent thermal ablation. Fourteen of the remaining 15 tumors achieved a satisfactory acoustic window after combination of artificial pleural effusion. One lesion remained inconspicuous and partly affected by pulmonary gas. The follow-up period was 8 months (3-30 months). The technical efficacy rate was confirmed to be 100% (75/75). During the follow-up period, local tumor progression occurred in 2 patients (2/75, 2.7%). Major complications occurred in two patients (2/64, 3.1%) receiving one-lung ventilation.Conclusions: One-lung ventilation is a promising noninvasive method for the thermal ablation of hepatic dome tumors due to its efficacy and safety.","Long, Yinglin; Zeng, Qingjing; He, Xuqi; Ye, Huolin; Su, Yating; Zheng, Rongqin; Yu, Jie; Xu, Erjiao; Li, Kai","International journal of hyperthermia : the official journal of European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology, North American Hyperthermia Group",26,19

Autophagy is a degradative process with a crucial anti-viral role; however, several viruses subvert this pathway in their benefit. We determined the role of autophagy in JUNV-infected cells analyzing LC3, a cytoplasmic protein (LC3-I) which becomes vesicle membrane-associated (LC3-II) upon induction of autophagy. Cells overexpressing EGFP-LC3 and infected with JUNV showed an increased number of LC3 puncta structures, similar to that obtained after starvation- or Bafilomycin A1- treatment which leads to autophagosome induction or accumulation, respectively. We also monitored the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II observing LC3-II levels in JUNV-infected cells similar to that observed in starved cells. Additionally, we kinetically studied the number of LC3 dots after JUNV infection and found that the virus activated the pathway as early as 2 h p.i. whereas the UV-inactivated virus did not induce the pathway. Cells subjected to starvation or pre-treated with rapamycin, a pharmacological autophagy inductor, enhanced virus yield. Also, we assayed the replication capacity of JUNV in Atg 5 knock-out or Beclin-1 knock-down cells [both critical components of the autophagic pathway] and found a significant decrease in JUNV replication. Taken together, our results constitute the first study indicating that JUNV infection induces an autophagic response which is functionally required by the virus for efficient propagation.IMPORTANCEMammalian arenaviruses are zoonotic viruses causing asymptomatic and persistent infections in their rodent hosts, but may produce severe and lethal haemorrhagic fevers in humans. Currently, there are neither effective therapeutic options nor effective vaccines, for viral haemorrhagic fevers caused by human pathogenic arenaviruses, except the vaccine Candid #1 against AHF, licensed for human use in endemic areas from Argentina. Since arenaviruses remain a severe threat to global public health, more in-depth knowledge of their replication mechanisms would improve our ability to fight against these viruses. Autophagy is a lysosomal degradative pathway involved in maintaining the cellular homeostasis, representing powerful anti-infective machinery. We showed, for the first time for a member of the Arenaviridae family, a pro-viral role of autophagy in JUNV infection, providing new knowledge in the edge of host-virus interaction. Therefore, modulation of virus-induced autophagy could be used as a strategy to block arenaviruses infections.","Roldán, Julieta S; Candurra, Nélida A; Colombo, María I; Delgui, Laura R",Journal of virology,26,7

No national guidelines for PPSV23 have been developed. We analyzed PPSV23 coverage and utilization in Hangzhou to determine patterns of PPSV23 use and the occurrence of adverse events following immunization (AEFI) in Hangzhou. MATERIALS AND METHODS Individuals over 2 years of age in Hangzhou were included. Vaccination data during 2006-2017 was retrieved from Hangzhou's Immunization Information System (HZIIS). We used descriptive epidemiological methods to determine PPSV23 usage patterns and AEFI occurrence. RESULTS In 2017, there were 9,027,973 persons above 2 years of age with the coverage of PPSV23 of 2.98%. The coverage of PPSV23 among elders ranged from 0.17% to 0.69%, and the overall coverage was higher in urban areas (3.70%) than in rural (3.34%) and suburban areas (2.16%). 93.45% of 268957 recipients were vaccinated with PPSV23 at 2-4 years of age. 394 AEFI of PPSV23 cases were reported to the Chinese national adverse event following immunization information system (CNAEFIS) during 2008-2017, with the reporting rate of 140.39 per 100,000 doses. CONCLUSION Persons in Hangzhou had overall low PPSV23 vaccination coverage especially for adults. Most of PPSV23 were used in children, while the proportion of the old population over 60 years slightly increased over year. PPSV23 was safe with a low reported AEFI rate, which was a little higher for children than for the elderly (over 60 years).","Liu, Yan; Xu, Yuyang; Wang, Jun; Che, Xinren; Gu, Wenwen; Du, Jian; Zhang, Xiaoping; Zhang, Xuechao; Jiang, Wei; Chen, Junfang; An, Zhijie",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,26,0

In such control programs, the disease-free status can be compromised by factors that pose risks for introduction or persistence of the virus. The aim of the present study was to gain a comprehensive overview of possible risk factors for BVDV infection in cattle herds in Europe and to assess their importance. Papers that considered risk factors for BVDV infection in cattle were identified through a systematic search. Further selection of papers eligible for quantitative analysis was performed using a predefined checklist, including (1) appropriate region (i.e., studies performed in Europe), (2) representativeness of the study population, (3) quality of statistical analysis, and (4) availability of sufficient quantitative data. In total, 18 observational studies were selected. Data were analyzed by a random-effects meta-analysis to obtain pooled estimates of the odds of BVDV infection.

Significant higher odds were found for dairy herds (odds ratio, OR = 1.63, 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.06-2.50) compared with beef herds, for larger herds (OR = 1.04 for every 10 extra animals in the herd, 95% CI: 1.02-1.06), for herds that participate in shows or markets (OR = 1.45, 95% CI: 1.10-1.91), for herds that introduced cattle into the herd (OR = 1.41, 95% CI: 1.18-1.69), and for herds that share pasture or have direct contact with cattle of other herds at pasture (OR = 1.32, 95% CI: 1.07-1.63). These pooled values must be interpreted with care, as there was a high level of heterogeneity between studies.

Different molar ratios of L/Fe3+ :Ch/Fe3+ , doses and sampling times were used in hydroponic and soil experiments using soybean (Glycine max) as model Strategy I crop in calcareous conditions. Also, ligand competition between the humate and chelating agents was examined. RESULTS Iron humate participates in the chelate shuttle mechanism providing available Fe to the chelating agent and then to the plants, showing a slight synergic effect. After a few days, the contribution of the chelates to the Fe nutrition decreases substantially, but the one from the humates is maintained. CONCLUSIONS The most efficient ratio was two parts of iron humates and one part of iron chelate. In particular, HBED/Fe3+ was the most suitable iron chelate since its lasting effect fits better to the iron humate long-term effect. The soluble iron in soil increased and the shoot to root iron translocation improved due to a synergic effect by a shuttle effect exerted by iron chelate in the mixture.

On postoperative dual-energy CT, parenchymal hyperdensities and iodine extravasation were present in 100% of the patients who developed intracerebral hemorrhage and in 56.3% of the patients who did not (P = .002 for both). Signs of bleeding were present in 35.7% of the patients who developed intracerebral hemorrhage and in none of the patients who did not (P < .001). Median maximum iodine concentration was 2.63 mg/mL in the patients who developed intracerebral hemorrhage and 1.4 mg/mL in the patients who did not (P < .001). Maximum iodine concentration showed an area under the curve of 0.89 for identifying patients developing intracerebral hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS The presence of parenchymal hyperdensity with a maximum iodine concentration of >1.35 mg/mL may identify patients developing intracerebral hemorrhage with 100% sensitivity and 67.6% specificity.","Bonatti, M; Lombardo, F; Zamboni, G A; Vittadello, F; Currò Dossi, R; Bonetti, B; Pozzi Mucelli, R; Bonatti, G",AJNR.

CASE DESCRIPTION We present a 33-year-old woman in hemodialysis with complete exhaustion of the brachial routes for vascular access, admitted to our Nephrology Unit for a long-term central venous catheter (CVC) implant, usually by us performed under EchoScopic Technique (EST), an echographic venipuncture followed by continuous radioscopic control of guidewire and catheter in all the steps of implant. An intraoperative venography showed a complete stop of right internal jugular vein, a right SVC, a persistent left SVC, a left inferior vena cava in the iliac and subrenal tracts, a circumaortic venous collar in the renal tract, and normal right suprarenal and hepatic tracts. CONCLUSIONS The double SVC was related to the persistence of the caudal part of the anterior cardinal veins. As to the PLIVC, the iliac and subrenal parts of the inferior vena cava can be related to the persistent left supracardinal vein, while the circumaortic venous collar to the persistent intersupracardinal and left subsupracardinal anastomoses. All invasive procedures, and particularly those potentially complicated, must be performed under EST, now considered a mandatory tool for CVC implants, owing to the hypothesis of possible venous congenital anomalies.","Ricciardi, Biagio; Ricciardi, Carlo Alberto; Lacquaniti, Antonio; Carella, Giuseppe; Puzzolo, Domenico; Pisani, Antonina; Di Mauro, Debora; Micali, Antonio",The journal of vascular access,26,6

There are numerous ways in which this will impact existing public health issues. In this article we aim to examine and reflect on the interactions between COVID-19 and tuberculosis (TB) another scourge which has long been the world's leading infectious killer. There are potentially grave consequences for existing and undiagnosed TB patients globally, particularly in low and middle income countries like India where TB is endemic and health services poorly equipped. TB control programmes are likely to be strained due to diversion of resources, and an inevitable loss of health system focus. This is likely to lead to a reduction in quality of TB care and worse outcomes. The symptoms of TB and COVID-19 can be similar, for instance symptoms like cough and fever. Not only can this create diagnostic confusion, but it could worsen the stigmatization of TB patients especially in LMICs, given the fear of COVID-19. Women with TB in India are a vulnerable group as gender disparities play a significant role in how men and women access healthcare in the public and private sectors. They are especially likely to suffer as part of the ""collateral damage"" and also experience the impact of the double stigma disproportionately. In this paper the researchers examine the impact of Covid 19 on women seeking TB care in India.","Suresh, Rajani; Ruban, S; Kumar, Saurabh",Health care for women international,26,11

MATERIAL AND METHODS The PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databanks were searched using the following MESH terms: zebrafish, cisplatin, ototoxicity. The identified publications were screened according to inclusion and exclusion criteria and the 26 qualifying manuscripts were included in the full-text analysis. The experimental protocols, including cisplatin concentrations, the exposure duration and the outcome measurements used in zebrafish larvae studies, were evaluated and the reported knowledge was summarized. RESULTS Twenty-six substances protecting from cisplatin-induced toxicity were identified with the use of zebrafish larvae. These substances include quinine, salvianolic acid B, berbamine 6, benzamil, quercetin, dexmedetomidine, dexamethsanone, quinoxaline, edaravone, apocynin, dimethyl sulfoxide, KR-22335, SRT1720, ORC-13661, 3-MA, D-methionine, mdivi-1, FUT-175, rapamycin, Z-LLF-CHO, ATX, NAC, CYM-5478, CHCP1, CHCP2 and leupeptin. The otoprotective effects of compounds were attributed to their anti-ROS, anti-apoptotic and cisplatin uptake-blocking properties. The broadest range of protection was achieved when the experimental flow used preconditioning with an otoprotective compound and later a co-incubation with cisplatin. Protection against a high concentration of cisplatin was observed only in protocols using short exposure times (4 and 6 h). CONCLUSIONS The data extracted from the selected papers confirm that despite the differences between the human and the zebra fish hearing thresholds (as affected by cisplatin), the sensory cells of zebrafish and larval zebrafish are a valuable tool which could be used: (i) for the discovery of novel otoprotective substances and compounds; (ii) to screen their side effects and (iii) to extend the knowledge on the mechanisms of cisplatin-induced inner ear damage. For future studies, the development of a consensus experimental protocol is highly recommended.","Domarecka, Ewa; Skarzynska, Magda; Szczepek, Agnieszka J; Hatzopoulos, Stavros",International journal of immunopathology and pharmacology,26,1

Compared with the apo, binary, and ternary complex structures of the original KOD polymerase, the 16 substitutions that result in the function of copying RNA to DNA do not change the overall protein structure. Only six substitutions occur at the substrate-binding surface, and the others change domain-domain interfaces in the polymerase to enable RNA-DNA hybrid binding and reverse transcription. Most notably, F587L at the Palm and Thumb interface stabilizes the open and apo conformation of the Thumb. The intrinsically flexible Thumb domain seems to play a major role in accommodating the RNA-DNA hybrid product distal to the active site. This is reminiscent of naturally occurring RNA-dependent DNA polymerases, including telomerase, which have a dramatically augmented Thumb domain, and of reverse transcriptase, which extends its Thumb with the RNase H domain.","Choi, Woo Suk; He, Peng; Pothukuchy, Arti; Gollihar, Jimmy; Ellington, Andrew D; Yang, Wei",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,26,31

VLPs assemble from subunits, i.e. capsomeres, composed of recombinantly expressed viral structural proteins. During downstream processing, in vivo-assembled VLPs are typically dis- and reassembled to remove encapsulated impurities and to improve particle morphology. Disassembly is achieved in a high-pH solution and by addition of a denaturant or reducing agent. The optimal disassembly conditions depend on the VLP amino acid sequence and structure, thus requiring material-consuming disassembly experiments. To this end, we developed a low-volume and high-resolution disassembly screening that provides time-resolved insight into the VLP disassembly progress. In this study, two variants of C-terminally truncated hepatitis B core antigen were investigated showing different disassembly behaviors. For both VLPs, the best capsomere yield was achieved at moderately high urea concentration and pH. Nonetheless, their disassembly behaviors differed particularly with respect to disassembly rate and aggregation. Based on the high-throughput screening results, a diafiltration-based disassembly process step was developed. Compared to mixing-based disassembly, it resulted in higher yields of up to 0.84 and allowed for integrated purification. This process step was embedded in a filtration-based process sequence of disassembly, capsomere separation, and reassembly, considerably reducing high-molecular-weight species.

Methods In this study, we combined in silico analysis and in vitro transwell experiments to identify a metastasis gene. Then, we used an in vivo experiment to validate the metastasis. Furthermore, a series of experiments such as FACS, Western blot, and ELISA were applied to explore the function of the metastasis gene. Results LTBP4 (latent transforming growth factor beta binding protein 4) was confirmed as a metastasis gene, whose expression levels are correlated with the overall survival rate of HCC patients. We further showed that the knockout of LTBP4 in an HCC cell line increased cell proliferation, activated the cell cycle, and induced metastasis events. Moreover, we proved that LTBP4-KO could increase the percentage of active TGFβ1 secreted by HCC cell lines, as well as the recruitment of MDSCs (myeloid-derived suppressor cells) by active TGFβ1 (transforming growth factor beta 1), which further inhibited CD8+ T cell proliferation and activated the immune suppression signal. Conclusion Our results demonstrate that the LTBP4-TGFβ1-MDSCs axis is a critical pathway for the immune suppression signals of HCC primary tumors.","Yang, Xiou; Ye, Xiaojuan; Zhang, Liuyan; Zhang, Xingguo; Shu, Peng",OncoTargets and therapy,26,1

However, not all individuals may have been affected in the same way. In addition to situational factors such as occupation, family status, and health, personality traits may affect how individuals experienced the initial crisis. METHODS Using data from the pairfam COVID-19 survey, an online survey of the participants of the German Family Panel pairfam conducted from May to July 2020, as well as personality data from the pairfam panel data, this study analyzes whether the Big Five personality traits influence the degree to which young and middle-aged individuals (16-49 years old) felt negatively affected by and were able to see any benefits of the initial COVID-19 lockdown in Germany. RESULTS While neuroticism is linked to a more negative perception of the restrictions to daily life, openness to experiences is associated with more positive perceptions of the situation. Like neuroticism, extraversion is also associated with a more negative perception, but only among respondents without a partner. For respondents with a romantic partner, no association was found. CONCLUSION Results confirm that personality plays a role in individual perceptions of the pandemic situation. Moreover, they show that most individuals perceived not only negative but also positive aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic situation in 2020.","Schmiedeberg, Claudia; Thönnissen, Carolin",Social science & medicine,26,1

The aim of this study is to describe a modified laparoscopic ventral rectocolpopexy procedure with a low approach to the sacral hollow (laparoscopic low ventral rectocolpopexy: LLVR). We propose this technique to manage combined rectogenital prolapse. METHODS Between November 2006 and June 2009, all patients with symptomatic rectal prolapse associated with genital prolapse and/or enterocele underwent LLVR. Demographics, results of imaging studies, mortality, morbidity, and functional outcome were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS Thirty patients underwent LLVR: two patients suffered from a full-thickness rectal prolapse while 28 had symptomatic recto-anal intussusception. The mean operating time was 94 ± 39 minutes. Conversion to laparotomy was never needed. Hospital stay ranged between 2 and 14 days (mean of 5 ± 2.5 days). No mortality was recorded and only two complications occurred (6.6%): one trocar site incisional hernia and one vaginal suture erosion in a patient who had concomitant hysterectomy. After a mean follow-up of 13.9 months, constipation was completely resolved or improved in 92.8% patients. Significant reduction in the mean Altomare obstructed defecation score (14.7-5.6; p < 0.05) was recorded. Preoperative incontinence improved after the procedure in all patients affected. No new cases of postoperative constipation or fecal incontinence were registered. Only one case of recurrence in a patient with recto-anal intussusception was recorded (3.4%), after 19 months. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic low ventral rectocolpopexy is safe and associated with very low morbidity.

Many water assessment studies are restricted to silo thinking, mostly focusing on water-related consequences, while lacking a quantification of trade-offs and synergies of economic, social, and environmental dimensions. To fill this knowledge gap, we propose a ""nexus"" approach that integrates a water supply constrained multi-regional input-output (mixed MRIO) model, scenario analysis, and multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to quantify the trade-offs and synergies at the sectoral level for the capital region of China, i.e. the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration. A total of 120 industrial transition scenarios including nine major industries with high water-intensities and water consumption under current development pathways were developed to facilitate the trade-off and synergy analysis between economic loss, social goals (here, the number of jobs) and environmental protection (with grey water footprint representing water pollution) triggered by water conservation measures. Our simulation results show that an imposition of a tolerable water constraint (a necessary water consumption reduction for regional water stress level to move from severe to moderate) in the region would result in an average economic loss of 68.4 (± 16.0) billion Yuan (1 yuan ≈ 0.158 USD$ in 2012), or 1.3 % of regional GDP, a loss of 1.94 (± 0.18) million jobs (i.e. 3.5 % of the work force) and a reduction of 1.27 (± 0.40) billion m3 or about 2.2% of the regional grey water footprint. A tolerable water rationing in water-intensive sectors such as Agriculture, Food and tobacco processing, Electricity and heating power production and Chemicals would result in the lowest economic and job losses and the largest environmental benefits. Based on MCDA, we selected the 10 best scenarios with regard to their economic, social and environmental performances as references for guiding future water management and suggested industrial transition policies. This integrated approach could be a powerful policy support tool for 1) assessing trade-offs and synergies among multiple criteria and across multiple region-sectors under resource constraints; 2) quantifying the short-term supply-chain effects of different containment measures, and 3) facilitating more insightful evaluation of SDGs at the regional level so as to determine priorities for local governments and practitioners to achieve SDGs.","Zhao, Dandan; Liu, Junguo; Sun, Laixiang; Ye, Bin; Hubacek, Klaus; Feng, Kuishuang; Varis, Olli",Water research,26,27

In our previous study, it was suggested that Ran is involved in the deltamethrin (DM) stress. In addition, Keap1-Nrf2-ARE pathway was also confirmed to be associated with DM stress. We report here that under DM stress, interfering Ran or nuclear transport factor Ntf2 by RNAi could suppress the nuclear import of nuclear transcription factor Nrf2 which then down-regulates the expressions of detoxification enzyme genes (Cyp4d20, Cyp4ae1, GstD5, Sod3, etc.), ultimately resulting in a significant apoptosis of Drosophila Kc cells. In contrast, after overexpressing Ran in Kc cells, Nrf2 has a higher concentration in the nucleus, and the expressions of detoxification enzyme genes are up-regulated, while the DM-induced apoptosis is significantly lower than that of the control group. Additionally, we preliminary found silencing Ntf2 or Ran could prevent the nuclear import of transcription factor Dif under DM stress, subsequently decreased expressions of antimicrobial peptide genes (Drsl1). In summary, our data mainly indicates that Ran may participate in DM stress through regulating the nuclear import of Nrf2, which could help to study the mechanism of deltamethrin resistance.

Methods From 2016 to 2018 an assessment of different administrative and leadership programs was performed by researching and reviewing previously outlined curricula. Using the data from this assessment, a questionnaire was developed, that was subsequently sent to members of the International Federation for Emergency Medicine's (IFEM) listserv. Results A total of 377 people from 38 different countries participated in the survey. The majority of respondents identified themselves as EM specialists (81%, 306/377), while others identified themselves as EM resident physicians (9.5%, 36/377) and non-EM specialist physicians (4.5%, 17/377). A large majority of respondents articulated that there was a paucity of developed curricula focusing on leadership, administrative, and management principles within their institution, training program, or professional organization. Across all topic areas, fewer than 30% of polled individuals indicated that they had formal education related to individual and programmatic leadership development, change management, assessment methodology, negotiation skills, financial analysis, media relations, and health care policy. Quality improvement (QI) was the only curricular element that a majority of respondents had integrated into their clinical practice (61%). Qualitative data analysis of the narrative comments was performed with further evaluation of thematic components. Conclusions The results of this study further support the findings that the majority of EM providers queried do not have a longitudinal curriculum that fosters administrative and leadership development nor advocate for its importance in relation to the quality of care. Given this gap, we propose that medical education at all levels-medical schools, EM resident/specialty training programs, and professional organizations-should consider creating administrative and leadership development programs. Additionally, development of any curriculum should require a global understanding of health care systems and awareness of the unique contexts of a given location and its available resources.","Tupesis, Janis P; Lin, Janet; Nicks, Brett; Chiu, Arthur; Arbalaez, Christian; Wai, Abraham; Jouriles, Nic",AEM education and training,26,1

In this overarching context, governments are faced with making rapid and high-stake decisions dictated by emergency that in a state of normalcy they would not, or could not pursue. Governments tend to gather, therefore, an incredible amount of unchecked power in times of fast-moving ecological crises that raises concerns about where the legitimacy of such excessive power comes from. Moreover, the elected politicians rely on the expert advice in a pandemic. This takes away democratic political authority from the sovereign people and instead places it on allegedly objective unelected experts. In contrast, experts have (1) a dubious reputation in predicting the future and (2) varying degrees of biases and self-interests, which make them susceptible, for instance, to ""framing problems"" in relation to the urgent public issues at stake. This article suggests new ways of thinking about COVID-19 technology policy, drawing from the field of political science and democratic theory. It examines the power-laden tensions between the political authority and the expert authority.

AIM To examine the applicability of the demands-resources to the school context. METHOD Data of 1,709 adolescents were gathered, once during the transition from comprehensive to post-comprehensive education, twice during post-comprehensive education, and once 2 years later. RESULTS The hypotheses were supported, path analysis showing that study demands were related to school burnout a year later, while study resources were related to schoolwork engagement. Self-efficacy was positively related to engagement and negatively to burnout. School burnout predicted schoolwork engagement negatively 1 year later. Engagement was positively related to life satisfaction 2 years later, while burnout was related to depressive symptoms. Finally, burnout mediated the relationship between study demands and mental health outcomes. CONCLUSIONS The demands-resources model can usefully be applied to the school context, including the associations between school-related burnout and engagement among adolescents. The model comprises two processes, the energy-depleting process and the motivational process.","Salmela-Aro, Katariina; Upadyaya, Katja",The British journal of educational psychology,26,19

Understanding which factors motivate their willingness to work (WTW) during infectious disease outbreaks may guide improvements in preparedness. The perspective of health care students, the future workforce, remains largely unexplored. This study compared factors influencing WTW among medical, nursing, and pharmacy students. METHODS A printed survey was administered to 631 medical, nursing, and pharmacy students. The questionnaire elicited information regarding prior disaster training, disease-related knowledge, and WTW in the setting of infectious diseases with contact or respiratory transmission. RESULTS Analyses of the 579 respondents (92% response rate) demonstrated that students were less fearful for their health and more willing to work during outbreaks with contact transmission than during those with respiratory transmission. Medical students were the most fearful for their health, but they demonstrated the greatest WTW, followed by nursing students, and then pharmacy students. Medical students were also the most knowledgeable about infectious diseases. Prior disaster training was associated with greater WTW. CONCLUSIONS Extent of disease-related knowledge and prior disaster training appear to influence WTW. Our findings, taken in the context of a remarkable underemphasis on disaster preparedness in health care curricula, call for a broader incorporation of disaster training to improve the WTW of health care students, and, ultimately, health care workers.

Results of an electronic survey.,20.00018,3.5599835,2021-06-05,"Evidence suggests that healthcare professionals are at an increased risk of dying by suicide, with anaesthetists at particularly high risk. However, much of the data on which this is based are historical. With a focus on the epidemiology and methods used, we conducted a systematic review of evidence regarding suicide and suicidal behaviour among anaesthetists to provide a more contemporary summary. The systematic review process was adapted from a previous similar study in veterinary surgeons and was consistent with recommended guidance. We identified 54 articles published in or after 1990 that had anaesthetist-specific data and met the inclusion criteria. Seven of these reported epidemiological data, of which four were published after 2000. Although none of the more recent studies reported standardised mortality rates specific to suicide in anaesthetists, the proportion of anaesthetists dying by suicide was increased with respect to comparator groups, which is consistent with previous findings. Eleven studies that included information on suicidal behaviour reported suicidal ideation in 3.2-25% of individuals (six studies) and suicide attempts in 0.5-2% (four studies). Studies reporting methods of suicide highlighted the use of anaesthetic drugs, particularly propofol, supporting the suggestion that the increased risk of suicide in anaesthetists may be related to the availability of the means. We discuss our findings in relation to other recently published data and guidance concerning mental health problems in anaesthetists.","Plunkett, E; Costello, A; Yentis, S M; Hawton, K",Anaesthesia,26,1

METHODS One hundred and fifty-two children of 1-10 years of age, who received general anesthesia for adenotonsillectomy were enrolled to the study. In all participants, the transverse diameter of the subglottis was measured with ultrasound during apnea. An endotracheal tube was chosen with the outer diameter matched to the measured subglottic airway diameter. An age-based (Motoyama-Khine) and height-based (Broselow) endotracheal tube size was calculated. If there was resistance to passage of the tube into the trachea or an airway pressure >25 cmH2 0 was required to detect an audible leak, the endotracheal tube was replaced with internal diameter of 0.5 mm smaller. If there was an audible leak at airway pressure <10 cmH2 O, or peak pressure >25 cmH2 0 or a cuff pressure > 25 cmH2 O was required to seal, the tube was changed to the 0.5 mm larger internal diameter. Best-fit tube internal diameter was the resultant tube internal diameter that met the previously stated conditions. The need for endotracheal tube replacement and peak airway pressure were recorded. RESULTS The internal diameter of ultrasound determined tube was the same as best-fit tube in 88% of children. Endotracheal tube was replaced in 15 patients with a one size larger, and in three patients with one size smaller tube. Using Bland-Altman analysis, a better agreement was observed with ultrasound measurement rather than height-based estimation and age-based formulas. CONCLUSION Our findings show that subglottic diameter measured by ultrasound appears to be a reliable predictor for the assessment of the subglottic diameter of the airway in estimating appropriate size pediatric endotracheal tube.","Altun, Demet; Orhan-Sungur, Mukadder; Ali, Achmet; Özkan-Seyhan, Tülay; Sivrikoz, Nükhet; Çamcı, Emre",Paediatric anaesthesia,26,1

Most people infected by the virus present mild to moderate respiratory symptoms and recover with supportive treatments. However, certain susceptible hosts develop an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), associated with an inflammatory ""cytokine storm"", leading to lung damage. Despite the current availability of different COVID-19 vaccines, the new emerging SARS-CoV-2 genetic variants represent a major concern worldwide, due to their increased transmissibility and rapid spread. Indeed, it seems that some mutations or combinations of mutations might confer selective advantages to the virus, such as the ability to evade the host immune responses elicited by COVID-19 vaccines. Several therapeutic approaches have been investigated but, to date, a unique and fully effective therapeutic protocol has not yet been achieved. In addition, steroid-based therapies, aimed to reduce inflammation in patients with severe COVID-19 disease, may increase the risk of opportunistic infections, increasing the hospitalization time and mortality rate of these patients. Hence, there is an unmet need to develop more effective therapeutic options. Here, we discuss the potential use of natural immunomodulators such as Thymosin α1 (Tα1), all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), and lactoferrin (LF), as adjunctive or preventive treatment of severe COVID-19 disease. These agents are considered to be multifunctional molecules because of their ability to enhance antiviral host immunity and restore the immune balance, depending on the host immune status. Furthermore, they are able to exert a broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity by means of direct interactions with cellular or molecular targets of pathogens or indirectly by increasing the host immune response. Thus, due to the aforementioned properties, these agents might have a great potential in a clinical setting, not only to counteract SARS-CoV-2 infection, but also to prevent opportunistic infections in critically ill COVID-19 patients.","Gaziano, R; Pistoia, E S; Campione, E; Fontana, C; Marino, D; Favaro, M; Pica, F; Di Francesco, P",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,26,5

This is a particular problem in the acute setting where malnutrition is prevalent. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the use of parenteral nutrition (PN) in critically ill surgical patients. METHODS This review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42017079567). Searches of the CENTRAL, EMBASE, and MEDLINE databases were performed using a predefined strategy. Randomised trials published in English since 1995, reporting a comparison of PN vs any comparator in a critically ill surgical population were included. The primary outcome was mortality. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation assessment. Meta-analysis was performed using a random effects model to assess variation in mortality and length of stay. RESULTS Fourteen RCTs were identified; standard PN was compared vs other forms of PN in ten studies, to PN with variable dose amino acids in one, and to enteral nutrition (EN) in three. In trials comparing glutamine-supplemented PN (PN-GLN) to PN, a non-significant reduction in mortality was noted (risk difference - 0.08. 95% CI - 0.17, 0.01, p = 0.08). A trend for a reduction in length of stay was seen in PN-GLN to PN comparator (mean reduction - 2.4, 95% CI - 7.19 to 2.32 days, I2 = 92%). Impact on other outcome measures varied in direction of effect. CONCLUSIONS PN may offer benefit in critically ill surgical patients. The size and quality of studies lead to uncertainty around the estimates of clinical effect, meaning a robust trial is required.","Ledgard, K; Mann, B; Hind, D; Lee, M J",Techniques in coloproctology,26,31

BACKGROUND Compliance with the DSG is important for maintaining blood safety, however, little is currently known about the extent of this among UK donors. MATERIALS AND METHODS The online, unlinked survey was based on the donor health check form with a focus on behaviours associated with blood borne infections, sexual contact, drug use and travel. The survey materials were reviewed by a donor focus group and the survey was piloted among 2982 UK donors. Percentage responses were calculated, complaints monitored and answers to questions reviewed. The survey went live in 2013; 225 091 donors were invited via email to participate followed by two reminders. RESULTS The survey was well received by the focus group, with little concern about the sensitive and personal questions. Their feedback led to important refinement in the survey materials. In the pilots, 21·0% (627/2982) responded, a reminder was necessary to achieve this. Among responders, there was evidence of non-compliance and test seeking behaviour, and no evidence that intention to donate again was affected. In the live survey, 29% (65 439) responded; responders were generally representative of donors overall. CONCLUSION A large scale survey of donor compliances is feasible, acceptable and effective in ascertaining appropriate information; involving donors and the blood services in the development stages through a focus group and pilots was important to achieve this.","Davison, K L; Reynolds, C A; Andrews, N; Brailsford, S R",Transfusion medicine,26,27

There have been concerns on whether alterations of ACE2 expression by renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors would contribute to the infectivity and severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We performed a case-control study to investigate the association between RAAS inhibitors and risk and severity of COVID-19 infection in South Korea using the population-based data provided by the Korean National Health Insurance System. Of 16 281 subjects with hypertension, there were 950 (5.8%) confirmed COVID-19 cases. After case-control matching, multivariable-adjusted conditional logistic regression analysis was performed. The adjusted odds ratio and 95% CIs for COVID-19 infection and long-term hospitalization comparing exposure to RAAS inhibitors and nonexposure to RAAS inhibitors was 1.161 (0.958-1.407) and 0.863 (0.533-1.397), respectively. When comparing exposure to RAAS inhibitors and nonexposure to RAAS inhibitors for intensive care unit admission, high-flow oxygen therapy, and death, the adjusted odds ratios (95% CIs) were 1.515 (0.402-5.701), 0.663 (0.272-1.619), and 1.363 (0.513-3.662), respectively. In all analyses, P values were not significant (P>0.05). The present study demonstrates the absence of an identifiable association between the exposure to RAAS inhibitors and risk and severity of COVID-19 infection, supporting the current medical guidelines and recommendations that patients should not discontinue RAAS inhibitors out of a concern that they are at increased risk for infection or severe illness of COVID-19.","Son, Minkook; Seo, Jeongkuk; Yang, Sung",Hypertension,26,7

BACKGROUND Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death worldwide. Small, dense low-density lipoprotein (sdLDL) has been hypothesized to induce atherosclerosis and subsequent coronary heart disease (CHD). However, the etiological relevance of lipoprotein particle size (sdLDL) versus cholesterol content (sdLDL-C) remains unclear. METHODS PubMed, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and EMBASE were systematically searched for studies published before February 2020. CHD associations were based on quartile comparisons in eight studies of sdLDL-C and were based on binary categorization in fourteen studies of sdLDL particle size. Reported hazards ratios (HR) and odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were standardized and pooled using a random-effects meta-analysis model. RESULTS Data were collated from 21 studies with a total of 30,628 subjects and 5,693 incident CHD events. The average age was 67 years, and 53% were men. Higher sdLDL and sdLDL-C levels were both significantly associated with higher risk of CHD. The pooled estimate for the high vs. low categorization of sdLDL was 1.36 (95% CI: 1.21, 1.52) and 1.07 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.12) for comparing the top quartiles versus the bottom of sdLDL-C. Several studies suggested a dose response relationship. CONCLUSIONS The findings show a positive association between sdLDL or sdLDL-C levels and CHD, which is supported by an increasing body of genetic evidence in favor of its causality as an etiological risk factor. Thus, the results support sdLDL and sdLDL-C as a risk marker, but further research is required to establish sdLDL or sdLDL-C as a potential therapeutic marker for incident CHD risk reduction.","Liou, Lathan; Kaptoge, Stephen",PloS one,26,33

MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively studied data obtained from electronic medical and regular medical records of patients with CD and IS in several academic, hospital-based, and university hospitals across Brazil. Descriptive analyses of cardioembolic and non-cardioembolic patients were performed.

Poor awareness and access to effective diagnosis have led to this enormous disease burden, calling for point-of-care, minimally invasive diagnosis methods. Here, an end-to-end quantitative approach for a new kind of diagnosis has been developed, comprising identification of optimal biomarkers, design of the sensor, and simulation of the diagnostic circuit. Using miRNA expression data in the public domain, we identified circulating miRNA biomarkers specific to cervical cancer using multi-tier screening. Synthetic riboregulators called toehold switches specific for the biomarker panel were then designed. To predict the dynamic range of toehold switches for use in genetic circuits as biosensors, we developed a generic grammar of these switches, and built a multivariate linear regression model using thermodynamic features derived from RNA secondary structure and interaction. The model yielded predictions of toehold efficacy with an adjusted R2 = 0.59. Reaction kinetics modelling was performed to predict the sensitivity of the second-generation toehold switches to the miRNA biomarkers. Simulations showed a linear response between 10nM and 100nM before saturation. Our study demonstrates an end-to-end workflow for the efficient design of genetic circuits geared towards the effective detection of unique genomic signatures that would be increasingly important in today’s world.

NHEs, found in the kidney and intestine, play a major role in the process of fluid reabsorption together via Na+,K+-ATPase pump and Na+ channels. Nevertheless, the expression pattern of NHE in the lung and its role in alveolar fluid homeostasis has not been addressed. Therefore, we aimed to examine the expression of NHE specific isoforms in alveolar epithelium cells (AECs), and assess their role in congestive heart failure. Three NHE isoforms were identified in AEC and A549 cell line, at the level of protein and mRNA; NHE1, NHE2 and mainly NHE8, the latter was shown to be localized in the apical membrane of AEC. Treating A549 cells with angiotensin (Ang) II for 1 and 3 hours displayed a significant reduction in NHE8 protein abundance and to lesser extent at 5 hours; however, there was no effect at 24 hours. Moreover, A549 treated overnight with Ang II downregulated NHE8 protein abundance. CHF rats held for 1 week had increased abundance of NHE8 compared to sham operated rats. However, lower abundance of NHE8 was observed in CHF rats held for 4 weeks. Herein we show, for the first time, the expression of a novel NHE isoform by AEC, namely NHE8. Besides being negatively affected by Ang II, NHE8 protein levels were distinctly affected in CHF rats, which may be related to CHF severity.","Kinaneh, Safa; Knany, Yara; Khoury, Emad; Ismael-Badarneh, Reem; Hammoud, Shadi; Berger, Gidon; Abassi, Zaid; Azzam, Zaher S.",bioRxiv,26,16

The necessary use of personal protective equipments, masks, gloves and other plastic products has to some extent reduced transmission of virus. However, the impact of plastic waste generated worldwide due to the pandemic has affected the environment globally. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has destructed and altered every part of life and environment globally. Potential impacts on environment are seen due to the transmission of virus as well as a slowdown in economic activities as lockdown prevails. Increased biomedical waste, improper usage and disposal of surgical masks, disinfectants, gloves, and increasing plastics wastes from domestic households continuously endangers environment. Not only it has an impact on the environment, but also deteriorates human health in the future. Global environmental sustainability is necessitated to overcome the plastic pollution problem and facilitate strategies to recycle and reuse plastics products. This review highlights the influence of COVID-19 on wastes generated by plastic products along with environmental challenges and repercussions. Also, measures to combat the plastic pollution problem have to be implemented for future protection and safety of the environment.

The Spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 has received special attention as it is the means by which the virus enters the human host cells. The N-terminal domain (NTD) is one of the targeted regions of the Spike protein for therapeutics and neutralizing antibodies against COVID-19. Though its function is not well-understood, the NTD is reported to acquire mutations and deletions that can accelerate the evolutionary adaptation of the virus driving antibody escape. Cellular processes are known to be regulated by complex interactions at the molecular level, which can be characterized by means of a graph representation facilitating the identification of key residues and critical communication pathways within the molecular complex. From extensive all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the entire Spike for the wild-type and the dominant variant, we derive a weighted graph representation of the protein in two dominant conformations of the receptor-binding-domain; all-down and one-up. We implement graph theory techniques to characterize the relevance of specific residues at facilitating roles of communication and control, while uncovering key implications for fitness and adaptation. We find that many of the reported high-frequency mutations tend to occur away from the critical residues highlighted by our graph theory analysis, implying that these mutations tend to avoid targeting residues that are most critical for protein allosteric communication. We propose that these critical residues could be candidate targets for novel antibody therapeutics. In addition, our analysis provides quantitative insights of the critical role of the NTD and furin cleavage site and their wide-reaching influence over the protein at large. Many of our conclusions are supported by empirical evidence while others point the way towards crucial simulation-guided experiments.","Manrique, P.D.; Chakraborty, S.; Nguyen, K.; Mansbach, R.; Korber, B.; Gnanakaran, S.",bioRxiv,26,1

Design An adapted version of the health partnership model by Boelen was used to identify Health Care Partners in each community: health providers, academics, policy makers, health managers, and community representatives. Qualitative data was gathered using a semi-structured interview guide. Major themes were identified through content analysis, and this information was fed back to the government and interviewees in reports every six months. Setting The 107 communities visited thus far have health care services that range from hospitals with surgical programs to remote communities with no medical services at all. The majority have access to local primary care. Participants Participants were recruited from the Health Care Partner groups identified above using purposeful and snowball sampling. Primary and secondary outcome measures A successful process was developed to engage rural communities in identifying their health care priorities, whilst simultaneously building and strengthening relationships. Qualitative data was analysed from 185 meetings in 75 communities and shared with policy makers at governmental and community levels. Results 36 parent themes have been identified and three overarching themes that interconnect all the interviews, namely Relationships, Autonomy and Change Over Time, are discussed. Conclusion The SV Project appears to be unique in that: it is physician led, prioritizes relationships, engages all of the health care partners singly and jointly in each community, is ongoing, provides feedback to both the policy makers and all interviewees on a 6-monthly basis and, by virtue of its large scope, has the ability to produce interim reports that have helped support system change.","Johnston, C.

The expressions for the basic reproduction number and the actual reproduction number under control actions are computed by means of the next generation matrix approach. This function is numerically investigated, showing some graphs which illustrate, qualitatively and quantitatively, in an intuitive way the positive effects of the controls and the negative contribution of the absence of a lifetime immunization from virus. © 2021 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

Analysis of 2L1S events usually involves grid searches over some parameters to locate approximate solutions as a prerequisite to posterior sampling, an expensive process that often requires human-in-the-loop domain expertise. As the next-generation, space-based microlensing survey with the Roman Space Telescope is expected to yield thousands of binary microlensing events, a new fast and automated method is desirable. Here, we present a likelihood-free inference (LFI) approach named amortized neural posterior estimation, where a neural density estimator (NDE) learns a surrogate posterior $\hat{p}(\theta|x)$ as an observation-parametrized conditional probability distribution, from pre-computed simulations over the full prior space. Trained on 291,012 simulated Roman-like 2L1S simulations, the NDE produces accurate and precise posteriors within seconds for any observation within the prior support without requiring a domain expert in the loop, thus allowing for real-time and automated inference. We show that the NDE also captures expected posterior degeneracies. The NDE posterior could then be refined into the exact posterior with a downstream MCMC sampler with minimal burn-in steps.","Zhang, Keming; Bloom, Joshua S.; Gaudi, B.

Students answered open-ended questions and wrote a reflection about how they experienced the pandemic. The majority of the participants reported sleep disturbances, depression, anxiety, and social isolation, identifying their family as the most important source of support during this time. Others tried to cope using their own resources. The study highlighted the need for increased awareness among faculty, education leaders and policy-makers about the psychological effects of lockdown and social isolation. There is a requirement for more support services for those affected by anxiety, depression, and regular follow-up after the pandemic ends to explore the long-term consequences.

Primero se analiza Netflix y su estrategia de branding en torno a la diversidad, y cómo esta puede también entenderse como diversidad cultural y lingüística. Después se analiza el proceso por el que estos tres films en euskera han llegado a la plataforma de streaming. Mediante entrevistas a los actores implicados (los directores Jon Garaño y Paul Urkijo, y el productor Xabi Berzosa) y el seguimiento de las películas, se concluye que, aun siendo notables las oportunidades ofrecidas por Netflix a este cine (en cuanto a financiación y distribución), los desafíos son inmensos en un panorama cambiante y volátil. La revolución del streaming debería tomarse en serio por las corporaciones públicas responsables de producir contenidos y otras alternativas al gigante Netflix (hoy epítome de la OTT) deberían ser tenidas en cuenta para que este caso de tres films no se convierta en mera anécdota.Alternate abstract:This article explores the way Basque language cinema is adapting to streaming platforms, focusing on the case of the three Basque language films that have made it to Netflix: Loreak (2014), Handia (2017) and Errementari (2018).

A predictive phenotype model built from nucleotide-level information alone has previously been considered un-tenable with respect to RNA viruses due to the ultra-high intra-sequence variance of their genomes, even within closely related clades. Building from our prior work developing a degenerate k-mer method to accommodate this high intra-sequence variation of RNA virus genomes for modeling frameworks, and leveraging a taxonomic ‘group-shuffle-split’ paradigm on complete coronavirus assemblies from prior to October 2018, we trained multiple regularized logistic regression classifiers at the nucleotide k-mer level capable of accurately predicting withheld SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences as human pathogens and accurately predicting withheld Swine Acute Diarrhea Syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) genome sequences as non-human pathogens. LASSO feature selection identified several degenerate nucleotide predictor motifs with high model coefficients for the human pathogen class that were present across widely disparate classes of coronaviruses. However, these motifs differed in which genes they were present in, what specific codons were used to encode them, and what the translated amino acid motif was. This emphasizes the importance of a phenetic view of emerging pathogenic RNA viruses, as opposed to the canonical phylogenetic interpretations most-commonly used to track and manage viral zoonoses. Applying our model to more recent Orthocoronavirinae genomes deposited since October 2018 yields a novel contextual view of pathogen-potential across bat-related, canine-related, porcine-related, and rodent-related coronaviruses and critical adaptations which may have contributed to the emergence of the pandemic SARS-CoV-2 virus. Finally, we discuss the utility of these predictive models (and their associated predictor motifs) to novel biosurveillance protocols that substantially increase the ‘pound-for-pound’ information content of field-collected sequencing data and make a strong argument for the necessity of routine collection and sequencing of zoonotic viruses.","Davis, Phillip; Russell, Joseph A.",bioRxiv,26,1

Rather there seems to be a need for some interaction between a therapist and client with two recent meta-analyses reporting this therapist effect. For the large-scale roll-out of cognitive remediation this poses a problem – how do we train these therapists? We know that training or at least educational background is important, so we need clear training packages and supervision. Covid-19 has also given us a greater challenge as it has limited our face-to-face interactions. To remove these two challenges we can use technology. For training we need online processes to increase training availability and for a lack of face to face contact we can provide the bridge with suitable platforms which allow the sharing of screens. Both would ensure that cognitive remediation is available to a wider group, although that requires overcoming the digital divide often experienced by people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia.

This paper examines the impact that these actions had on emissions and expected health effects through reduced personal vehicle travel and electricity consumption. Using daily cell phone mobility data for each U.S. county, we find that vehicle travel dropped about 40% by mid-April across the nation. States that imposed stay-at-home policies before March 28 decreased travel slightly more than other states, but travel in all states decreased significantly. Using data on hourly electricity consumption by electricity region (e.g., balancing authority), we find that electricity consumption fell about 6% on average by mid-April with substantial heterogeneity. Given these decreases in travel and electricity use, we estimate the county-level expected improvements in air quality, and, therefore, expected declines in mortality. Overall, we estimate that, for a month of social distancing, the expected premature deaths due to air pollution from personal vehicle travel and electricity consumption declined by approximately 360 deaths, or about 25% of the baseline 1500 deaths. In addition, we estimate that CO2 emissions from these sources fell by 46 million metric tons (a reduction of approximately 19%) over the same time frame. © 2021 by the authors.

Methods Online questionnaire surveys were conducted among 3 600 primary school students aged 6-12 years in Jilin Province, China in April, 2020 (during the epidemic) and 3 089 primary school students in September, 2020 (during the regular epidemic prevention and control). The general information and the data related to the Mental Health Scale for Child and Adolescent were collected by the questionnaire surveys. The multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the factors influencing the mental health status of the students during the epidemic. Results The students during the epidemic had a significantly poorer mental health status in the emotional experience and volitional behavior than those during the regular epidemic prevention and control (P<0.05). The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed the risk of psychological problems of the students decreased with age (OR=0.895). The girls were at a higher risk of psychological problems than boys (OR=1.453). The students with father's and mother's charater between irritability and gentle were at a lower risk of psychological problems (OR=0.496 and 0.470 respectively). The students from a family with a parental education style of a combination of encouraging and scolding were at a lower risk of psychological problems (OR=0.263). The students from a single-parent family or an extended family were at a higher risk of psychological problems (OR=2.995 and 3.446 respectively). Conclusions The COVID-19 epidemic has a certain impact on emotional experience and volitional behavior of primary school students. During the epidemic, particular attention should be paid to the mental health of primary school students, especially girls, younger students, and students from single-parent families, extended families or families with impatient parents and improper parental education.","Zhao, Zhi Ruo Zeng Fan Jie Ren Wen Jing Song Ya Lan Tian Jing Li Ping",Chinese Journal of Contemporary Pediatrics,26,23

Methods: immunogenicity was measured through the analysis of anti SARS-CoV2 IgG Antibodies and antigen specific CD4 T cells (CD40L+), detected by flow cytometry before vaccination, 21 days after priming (T21), 7 days after booster dose (T28) and 2-4 months after priming (T120). Baseline T and B cell immune phenotype was deeply investigated. The safety profile was investigated by close monitoring and self-reported diary. Results: Anti-S and anti-Trimeric Ab responses were significantly lower in SOT vs HC at T21 (p<0.0001) and at T28 (p<0.0001). Ten out of 34 SOT (29%) at T28 and 3 out of 33 (9%) at T120 had undetectable SARS-CoV-2 IgG. The analysis of SARS-CoV-2 specific CD4 T cells showed lower CD40L expression after in vitro stimulation in SOT compared to HC. Lower frequencies of memory B cells were found in patients not responding to vaccination. Lack of seroconversion was higher in patients treated with mycophenolate (p=0.0005). The vaccination was safe and well tolerated. Only short-term adverse events, were reported and no hospitalization or graft rejection were observed after vaccinations. Conclusions: These data show that SOT have a suboptimal immune response following mRNA vaccinations as compared to HC. Alternative strategies should be investigated to improve the immunization against SARS-CoV-2 in these patients.","Cotugno, N.; Pighi, C.; Morrocchi, E.; Ruggiero, A.; Amodio, D.; Medri, C.; Colagrossi, L.; Di Cesare, S.; Santilli, V.; Manno, E.

The patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9) and generalized anxiety disorder questionnaire (GAD-7) were used to assess depression and anxiety.ResultsThe majority of the participants were male (66.2%), aged 18–29 (47.7%) from the Eastern region (66.15%), who were still waiting for the result of the COVID-19 test (64.6%). Approximately half of the sample had depressive and anxiety symptoms (49.2% and 44.6%, respectively). The depression mean score was significantly higher only among the 18–29 age group. However, the depression and anxiety mean scores were higher among females than males and among participants with positive COVID-19 test results compared to those who had pending or negative results. The anxiety mean score was higher during the first week of quarantine, but the depression mean score was higher during later weeks.ConclusionsDepression and anxiety were prevalent among people in quarantine during the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak in Saudi Arabia.

FEP is based on the systemic approach of the biocultural ethic that values the vital links among the life habits of co-inhabitants (humans and other-than-humans) who share a common habitat. Based on this “3Hs” model (habitats, co-inhabitants, habits), FEP combines tourism with experiential education to reorient biocultural homogenization toward biocultural conservation. FEP’s methodological approach seeks to integrate social, economic, and environmental dimensions of sustainability by generating new links between biological and cultural diversity at different spatial and social scales. Ecotourism has an underutilized potential to link sciences with education and conservation practices at different scales. By incorporating a philosophical foundation, FEP broadens both understanding and practices of environmental education and sustainable tourism. FEP has been developed at the Omora Ethnobotanical Park in the Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve, Chile, at the southern end of the Americas since 2000, where it has oriented transdisciplinary work for the creation of new protected areas and ecotourism practices. FEP enables an integration of biophysical, cultural, and institutional dimensions into the design of ecotourism activities that transform and broaden the perceptions of tourists, local guides, students, and other participants to better appreciate local biological and cultural diversity. FEP’s methodology is starting to be adapted in other world regions, such as Germany, Japan, and Mexico, to integrate education and ecotourism for sustainability.","Tauro, Alejandra Ojeda Jaime Caviness Terrance Moses Kelli P.; Moreno-Terrazas, René Wright T.; Zhu, Danqiong Poole Alexandria K.; Massardo, Francisca Rozzi Ricardo",Sustainability,26,1

In this article, we study dynamical models of the translation kinetics after mRNA transfection and analyze their parameter identifiability. Previous studies have considered ordinary differential equation (ODE) models of the process, and here we formulate a stochastic differential equation (SDE) model. For both model types, we consider structural identifiability based on the model equations and practical identifiability based on simulated as well as experimental data and find that the SDE model provides better parameter identifiability than the ODE model. Moreover, our analysis shows that even for those parameters of the ODE model that are considered to be identifiable, the obtained estimates are sometimes unreliable. Overall, our study clearly demonstrates the relevance of considering different modeling approaches and that stochastic models can provide more reliable and informative results.","Pieschner, Susanne; Hasenauer, Jan; Fuchs, Christiane",bioRxiv,26,1

In children previous studies have reported colonisation to be a symptomatic event and described a relationship between symptom severity/frequency and colonisation density. The evidence for this in adults is lacking in the literature. This study uses an experimental human pneumococcal challenge model to explore whether pneumococcal colonisation (or co-colonisation with a respiratory virus) is a symptomatic event in healthy adults. Methods Healthy volunteers aged 18-50 were recruited and inoculated intra-nasally with either Streptococcus pneumoniae (serotypes 6B, 23F) or saline as a control. Respiratory viral swabs were obtained prior to inoculation. Nasal and non-nasal symptoms were then assessed using a modified Likert score between 1 (no symptoms) to 7 (cannot function). The rate of symptoms reported between groups was compared and a correlation analysis performed. Results Data from 54 participants were analysed. 46 were inoculated with S. pneumoniae (29 with 6B, 17 with 23F) and 8 received saline. In total, 14 became experimentally colonised (30.4%), all of which were inoculated with 6B serotype. There was no statistically significant difference in nasal (p= 0.45) or non-nasal symptoms (p=0.28) between the pneumococcal inoculation group and the saline group. There was no direct correlation between colonisation density and symptom severity in those who were colonised. In the 22% (12/52) who were co-colonised with pneumococcus and respiratory viruses there was no statistical difference in either nasal or non-nasal symptoms (virus positive p=0.74 and virus negative p=1.0). Conclusion Pneumococcal colonisation is asymptomatic in healthy adults, regardless of bacterial density or viral co-colonisation.","Trimble, Ashleigh; Connor, Victoria; Robinson, Ryan E; Hancock, Carole A; Wang, Duolao; Gordon, Stephen B; Ferreira, Daniela M; Wright, Angela D; Collins, Andrea M",bioRxiv,26,10

In the absence of vaccines and the unavailability of effective drugs for the SARS-CoV-2 infection, vaccine development is being continuously explored and several antiviral compounds and immunotherapies are currently being investigated. Given the high similarity in genetic identity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the present investigation identified the interaction between the physicochemical properties and the antiviral activity of different potential and clinically approved antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV using hierarchically weighted principal component analysis. Representative drugs from the classes of neuraminidase inhibitors, reverse transcriptase inhibitors, protease inhibitors, nucleoside analogues, and other compounds with potential antiviral activity were examined. The pharmacologic classification and the biological activity of the different antiviral drugs were described using indices, namely, rotatable bond count, molecular weight, heavy atom count, and molecular complexity (92.32% contribution rate). The physicochemical properties and inhibitory action against SARS-CoV-2 of lopinavir, chloroquine, ivermectin, and ciclesonide validated the adequacy of the current computational approach.

The existing scientific literature on Digital twin primarily refers to a product entity or a physical machine but the core concept can be applied to the entire product lifecycle, particularly the assembly process of a complex product system. In addition, majority of existing work focus on the Digital Twins of individual machines on a shop-floor. This paper focuses on aspects the process to build DTs of a production schedule for a complex defence weapon system. The process is inherently high variety and low quantity in a very manual assembly process. This paper consists of three elements. (1) It reviews the current state of art along with the research gap and discusses how DT can become a tool to the manual assembly process. (2) A data-driven simulation algorithm is proposed to model the complex and manual manufacturing process in a generic-reusable way.

Conventional design methods of the ultrasonic vibrators are difficult to achieve complex hybrid vibration due to the limit of traditional straight shape and the tedious machining processes in fabrication. To overcome the disadvantages, this paper presents a new design of a hybrid longitudinal-torsional (L&T) ultrasonic vibrator. The hybrid L&T vibrator was designed using the acoustic waveguide principle and successfully transform the longitudinal vibration into a harmonic torsional vibration on the sample plane. An analytical finite element modeling was conducted for optimizing the hybrid L&T design parameters. Due to the complex design geometry, the new L&T design is difficult to be manufactured by conventional machining processes. Selective laser melting additive manufacture (SLM-AM) was used to fabricate the new hybrid L&T vibrator design. The designed hybrid longitudinal-torsional (L&T) vibrator was driven by axially polarized piezo-ceramic stacks for ultrasonic vibration applications. The experiments validate that the developed L&T vibrator is able to deliver high-energy efficiency vibration in both the longitudinal and the torsional directions. The presented new design of L&T ultrasonic vibrators can be used for applications of ultrasonic machining, surgical bone drilling, high efficient ultrasonic motors, or vibrational needle insertions or surgical tools for medical treatments.","Wang, Yi; Lee, Yuan-Shin; Cai, Yi; Sun, Yijia; Gong, Hu",Procedia Manufacturing,26,29

Individual organisms are not truly independent, and as a result phylogenetic corrections are necessary to increase the accuracy of scaling relationships. The relationships between body mass and gestation length have not been previously reported at the Family level, as it was previously thought species had insufficient time to diverge evolutionarily leaving phylogenetic corrections unnecessary. Using a Carnivora supertree, we perform a phylogenetically generalised least squares (PGLS) analysis using life history information largely from the Pantheria dataset. Our results suggest that allometric relationships are maintained in four families: Canidae, Felidae, Herpestidae and Otariidae. Conversely, several evolutionary mechanisms may contribute to the lack of a significant scaling parameter in other families, such as diverse reproductive strategies or positive selection for genes affecting adiposity. In addition, low sample sizes or the inclusion of paternal body masses could alter the presence of significant scaling. Our results suggests that PGLS analyses are informative at the family level, and the absence of scaling can provide insight to understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms that work on the family taxonomic level or below.

The aim of this paper is to conduct a systematic literature review on safety and efficacy of pulse glucocorticoid therapy for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoronaVirus (CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 infections and describe a case-series of COVID-19 patients treated with off-label pulse doses of methylprednisolone. METHODS We performed a systematic literature review on safety and efficacy of pulse therapy for betacoronaviridae infections as described in the protocol registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020190183). All consecutive patients admitted to Arcispedale Santa Maria Nuova di Reggio Emilia or Guastalla Hospital with COVID-19 between March 1st and April 30th, 2020 and treated with methylprednisolone 1 gram/day for at least three days were included in the case series. A retrospective review of available computed tomography (CT) scan and chest x-ray was performed independently by two radiologists blinded to clinical data, and discordances were resolved by consensus. RESULTS Twenty papers were included for SARS, but only two were comparative and were included in the primary endpoint analysis. Likewise, eleven papers were included for COVID-19, four of which were comparative and were considered for the primary outcome analysis. Included studies for both SARS and COVID-19 are mostly retrospective and highly heterogeneous, with lethality ranging from 0% to 100% and ICU admission rate ranging from 9% to 100%. Fourteen patients were included in our case series, 7 males and 7 females. CONCLUSIONS No randomised controlled trial is available yet for corticosteroids pulse-therapy defined as at least ≥500mg/day methylprednisolone in patients with emerging coronavirus pneumonia. Lethality among our cohort is high (4/14), but this finding should be interpreted with caution due to the fact that in our setting pulse-steroids were used in patients not eligible for other treatments because of comorbidities or as rescue therapy.

Like other enveloped viruses, coronavirus assembly is presumably dependent on protein localization and protein-protein as well as protein-RNA interactions. We have used the bovine coronavirus (BCV) as a model to study interactions between the viral proteins in virus-infected cells that are important for coronavirus assembly. BCV is a prototype for the coronaviruses that express an additional major structural protein, the hemagglutinin esterase (HE), in addition to the spike (S) glycoprotein, membrane (M) glycoprotein, and nucleocapsid (N) protein. Complexes consisting of the M, S, and HE proteins were detected in virus-infected cells by coimmunoprecipitations. Kinetic analyses demonstrated that S protein and HE each quickly formed a complex with M protein after synthesis, whereas heterocomplexes consisting of all three proteins formed more slowly. The kinetics of HE biosynthesis revealed that the half-life of oligomerization was approximately 30 min, which correlated with the appearance of complexes consisting of M, HE, and S proteins, suggesting that oligomerization and/or conformational changes may be important for the S-M-HE protein complexes to form. Only HE dimers were found associated with the heterocomplexes consisting of all three proteins. S-M-HE protein complexes were detected prior to processing of the oligosaccharide chains on HE, indicating that these protein complexes formed in a premedial Golgi compartment before trimming of sugar chains. Transient coexpressions and double-labeling immunofluorescence demonstrated that HE and S proteins colocalized with M protein. This was further supported by coimmunoprecipitation of specific HE-M and S-M protein complexes from transfected cells, indicating that these proteins can form complexes in the absence of other viral proteins.","Nguyen, V P; Hogue, B G",Journal of virology,26,33

The major goal of this review is to show the interconnections between intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and human neurodegeneration. This brings to existence a new D³ concept: protein intrinsic Disorder in neuroDegenerative Diseases. An important aspect of the D³ concept is that it deals with three D³'s, emphasizing that intrinsically Disordered proteins are abundantly found in various neuroDegenerative Diseases (the first D³), that these IDPs provoke neuroDegeneration due to their Dysfunctionality (the second D³), and that neuroDegeneration-related IDPs are often controlled by other Disordered proteins (the third D³).","Uversky, Vladimir N",Frontiers in bioscience,26,33

METHODS The study participants were 677 employed men and women who were followed up for 3 to 5 years (mean = 3.6 years) for the onset of diagnosed type 2 diabetes. Burnout was assessed by the Shirom-Melamed Burnout Measure with its three subscales: emotional exhaustion, physical fatigue, and cognitive weariness. RESULTS The burnout symptoms were remarkably consistent over the follow-up period irrespective of changes in place of work and in employment status. During the follow-up period, 17 workers developed type 2 diabetes. Logistic regression results indicated that burnout was associated with a 1.84-fold increased risk of diabetes (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.19-2.85) even after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, smoking, alcohol use, leisure time physical activity, initial job category, and follow-up duration. In a subsample of 507 workers, the relative risk of diabetes was found to be much higher after additional control for blood pressure levels (odds ratio = 4.32, 95% CI = 1.75-10.67), available only for this subsample. CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest that chronic burnout might be a risk factor for the onset of type 2 diabetes in apparently healthy individuals.","Melamed, Samuel; Shirom, Arie; Toker, Sharon; Shapira, Itzhak",Psychosomatic medicine,26,4

The predicted unknown proteins (PUPs) encoded by the accessory genes, which are considered to be unique to the SARS-CoV genome, might play important roles in the SARS-CoV infection. Two of these genes, called ORF10 and X5, were synthesized and introduced into E. coli and Streptomyces lividans TK24, respectively. SDS-PAGE and Western blot revealed that the ORF10 and X5 genes have been expressed in the two hosts. This is the first report of heterologous expression of ORF10 and X5 genes in E. coli and S. lividans TK24.

We investigated the role of vertical transmission in perpetuating the high prevalence of these chronic GAV infections. Reverse transcription (RT)-nested PCR detected GAV in spermatophores and mature ovarian tissue from broodstock and in fertilized eggs and nauplii spawned from wild-fertilized females. In laboratory-reared P. monodon (> 12 mo old) that had a high mortality rate, RT-nested PCR detected GAV in male spermatophores at levels significantly higher than that detected in the lymphoid organ. By transmission electron microscopy (TEM), GAV virions were detected in spermatophore seminal fluid, but not sperm cells. Histological evidence of hypertrophied cell foci (spheroids) and TEM observation of GAV nucleocapsids and virions in spheroid cells was also found in 100% of lymphoid organs of approximately 1.2 g juvenile P. monodon reared in the laboratory from postlarvae collected from commercial hatcheries. Sequence analysis of PCR amplicons from parental P. monodon and fertilized eggs of artificially inseminated broodstock indicated that GAV associated with eggs can originate from both the male and female parents. Although the female GAV genotype was predominant in eggs, there was some dependence on infection levels in the male and female shrimp as indicated by RT-PCR. RT-nested PCR data on GAV levels in eggs, nauplii, protozoea and PL5 progeny of the artificial matings suggests that vertically transmitted virus is most probably associated with the egg surface.","Cowley, Jeff A; Hall, Michael R; Cadogan, Lee C; Spann, Kirsten M; Walker, Peter J",Diseases of aquatic organisms,26,29

The SARS-CoV-2 virus has overtaken globe to economic and social lockdown. Many patients with COVID-19 have compromised immunity, especially in an aged population suffering from Parkinson disease (PD). Alteration in dopaminergic neurons or deficiency of dopamine in PD patients is the most common symptoms affecting 1% population above the age of 60 years. The compromised immune system and inflammatory manifestation in PD patients make them an easy target. The most common under trial drugs for COVID-19 are Remdesivir, Favipiravir, Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine, Azithromycin along with adjunct drugs like Amantadine with some monoclonal antibodies. Presently, clinically US FDA approved drugs in PD includes Levodopa, catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitors, (Entacapone and Tolcapone), Dopamine agonists (Bromocriptine, Ropinirole, Pramipexole, and Rotigotine), Monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitors (Selegiline and Rasagiline), Amantadine and Antimuscarinic drugs. The drugs have established mechanism of action on PD patients with known pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic properties along with dose and adverse effects. Conclusion and relevance of this review focus on the drugs that can be tried for the PD patients with SAR CoV-2 infection, in particular, Amantadine approved by all developed countries a common drug possessing both antiviral properties by downregulation of CTSL, lysosomal pathway disturbance and change in pH necessary to uncoat the viral proteins and antiParkinson properties. The significant prognostic adverse effect of SARS-CoV-2 on PD and the present-day treatment options, clinical presentation and various mechanism is warrant need of the hour.","Anwar, Firoz; Naqvi, Salma; Al-Abbasi, Fahad A; Neelofar, Nauroz; Kumar, Vikas; Sahoo, Ankit; Kamal, Mohammad Amjad",Curr. med. chem,26,16

As an RNA virus, SARS-CoV-2 has a high mutation rate due to the low fidelity of RNA polymerase. To study the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, 158 SNPs with high confidence were identified by deep meta-transcriptomic sequencing, and the most common SNP type was C > T. Analyses of intra-host population diversity revealed that intra-host quasispecies' composition varies with time during the early onset of symptoms, which implicates viral evolution during infection. Network analysis of co-occurring SNPs revealed the most abundant non-synonymous SNP 22,638 in the S glycoprotein RBD region and 28,144 in the ORF8 region. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 variations differ in an individual's respiratory tissue (nose, throat, BALF, or sputum), suggesting independent compartmentalization of SARS-CoV-2 populations in patients. The positive selection analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 genome uncovered the positive selected amino acid G251V on ORF3a. Alternative allele frequency spectrum (AAFS) of all variants revealed that ORF8 could bear alternate alleles with high frequency.

The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptors and enter the host cells. Several reports have been highlighted the importance of ACE-2 on the pathogenesis of COVID-19. In the present study, we hypothesize that a functional insertion/deletion polymorphism in the ACE gene could be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and mortality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PubMed and Google scholar search engines were used to obtained data on the prevalence of ACE I/D polymorphism in different countries of the Asia continent. Data on COVID-19 infection rate (per million), mortality/million, and percentage of recovery were acquired form worldometer website. The Spearman rank correlation test performed to investigate the correlation of allele 'D' with SARS-CoV-2 infection, mortality rate, and recovery percentage. RESULTS: Epidemiological investigation revealed a significant positive correlation of D allele of ACE polymorphism with SARS-CoV-2 infection (r = 0.502, p = 0.008, n = 26) and mortality rate (r = 0.620, p = 0.002, n = 22) in Asian population. However, no significant role of ACE I/D polymorphism was observed with recovery rate of patients from SARS-CoV-2 infection (r = -0.208, p = 0.352, n = 22).

Internet search volumes are useful data that can sensitively detect trends of the public's attention during a pandemic outbreak situation. OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to analyze the public's interest in COVID-19 proliferation, identify the correlation between the proliferation of COVID-19 and interest in immunity and products that have been reported to confer an enhancement of immunity, and suggest measures for interventions that should be implemented from a health and medical point of view. METHODS: To assess the level of public interest in infectious diseases during the initial days of the COVID-19 outbreak, we extracted Google search data from January 20, 2020, onward and compared them to data from March 15, 2020, which was approximately 2 months after the COVID-19 outbreak began. In order to determine whether the public became interested in the immune system, we selected coronavirus, immune, and vitamin as our final search terms. RESULTS: The increase in the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases that occurred after January 20, 2020, had a strong positive correlation with the search volumes for the terms coronavirus (R=0.786; P<.001), immune (R=0.745; P<.001), and vitamin (R=0.778; P<.001), and the correlations between variables were all mutually statistically significant. Moreover, these correlations were confirmed on a country basis when we restricted our analyses to the United States, the United Kingdom, Italy, and Korea. Our findings revealed that increases in search volumes for the terms coronavirus and immune preceded the actual occurrences of confirmed cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that during the initial phase of the COVID-19 crisis, the public's desire and actions of strengthening their own immune systems were enhanced. Further, in the early stage of a pandemic, social media platforms have a high potential for informing the public about potentially helpful measures to prevent the spread of an infectious disease and provide relevant information about immunity, thereby increasing the public's knowledge.","Lee, Jinhee; Kwan, Yunna; Lee, Jun Young; Shin, Jae Il; Lee, Keum Hwa; Hong, Sung Hwi; Han, Young Joo; Kronbichler, Andreas; Smith, Lee; Koyanagi, Ai; Jacob, Louis; Choi, SungWon; Ghayda, Ramy Abou; Park, Myung-Bae",J Med Internet Res,26,29

Objectives: To identify and describe core services provided by the pharmacist during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A literature search was performed in MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and LILACS for studies published between December 1st, 2019 and May 20th, 2020 without language restriction. Studies that reported services provided by pharmacists during the COVID-19 pandemic were included. Two independent authors performed study selection and data extraction with a consensus process. The pharmacist's intervention identified in the included studies were described based on key domains in the DEPICT v.2. Results: A total of 1189 records were identified, of which 11 studies fully met the eligibility criteria. Most of them were conducted in the United States of America (n = 4) and China (n = 4). The most common type of publication were letters (n = 4) describing the workplace of the pharmacist in hospitals (n = 8). These findings showed the different roles of pharmacists during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as disease prevention and infection control, adequate storage and drug supply, patient care and support for healthcare professionals. Pharmacists' interventions were mostly conducted for healthcare professionals and patients (n = 7), through one-to-one contact (n = 11), telephone (n = 6) or video conference (n = 5). The pharmacists' main responsibility was to provide drug information for healthcare professionals (n = 7) as well as patient counseling (n = 8). Conclusions: A reasonable number of studies that described the role of the pharmacists during the COVID-19 pandemic were found. All studies reported actions taken by pharmacists, although without providing a satisfactory description. Thus, future research with more detailed description as well as an evaluation of the impact of pharmacist intervention is needed in order to guide future actions in this and/or other pandemic.","Visacri, Marília Berlofa; Figueiredo, Isabel Vitória; Lima, Tácio de Mendonça",Res.

Catheter-based therapies are emerging as a new armamentarium for improving outcomes in these patients. Purpose of review: The purpose of this review is to familiarize the clinicians with (1) various types of catheter-based modalities available for patients with acute PE, (2) advantages, disadvantages, and appropriate patient selection for the use of these devices, and (3) evidence base and the relevance of such therapies in the COVID-19 pandemic. Recent findings: There are four main types of catheter-based therapies in acute PE: (1) standard catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT), (2) ultrasound-assisted CDT, (3) pharmacomechanical CDT, and (4) mechanical thrombectomy without thrombolysis. Ultrasound-assisted thrombolysis is the most widely studied modality in this group;however, evidence base for other catheter-based technologies is rapidly emerging. Summary: Current use of catheter-based therapies is most suitable for patients with intermediate and high-risk acute PE. The adoption of a multidisciplinary approach like the pulmonary embolism response team (PERT) is desirable for appropriate patient selection and possibly/potentially improving patient outcomes. We discuss the current status of these therapies.","Singh, M.; Shafi, I.; Rali, P.; Panaro, J.; Lakhter, V.; Bashir, R.",Current Treatment Options in Cardiovascular Medicine,26,3

Has traffic noise from cars and airplanes really gone down, so that more birdsong can be heard? Have socially distanced people quietened down? This article presents a case study of the human perception of environmental sounds in an urban neighborhood in the Basque Country between 15 March and 25 May 2020 The social restrictions imposed through national legislation divided the 69-day period into three phases We collected observations, field audio recordings, photography, and diary notes on 50 days Experts in soundscape and architecture were presented with the recordings, in randomized order, and made two separate perceptual analyses One group (N = 11) rated the recordings for pleasantness and eventfulness using an adapted version of the Swedish Soundscape Quality Protocol, and a partly overlapping group (N = 12) annotated perceived sound events with free-form semantic labels The labels were systematically classified into a four-level Taxonomy of Sound Sources, allowing an estimation of the relative amounts of Natural, Human, and Technological sounds Loudness and three descriptors developed for bioacoustics were extracted computationally Analysis showed that Eventfulness, Acoustic Complexity, and Acoustic Richness increased significantly over the time period, while the amount of Technological sounds decreased These observations were interpreted as reflecting changes in people's outdoor activities and behavior over the whole 69-day period, evidenced in an increased presence of Human sounds of voices and walking, and a significant shift from motorized vehicles toward personal mobility devices, again evidenced by perceived sounds Quantitative results provided a backdrop against which qualitative analyses of diary notes and observations were interpreted in relation to the restrictions and the architectural specifics of the site An integrated analysis of all sources pointed at the temporary suspension of human outdoor activity as the main reason for such a change In the third phase, the progressive return of street life and the usage of personal mobility vehicles seemed to be responsible for a clear increase in Eventfulness and Loudness even in the context of an overall decrease of Technological sounds Indoor human activity shared through open windows and an increased presence of birdsong emerge as a novel characteristic element of the local urban soundscape We discuss how such changes in the acoustic environment of the site, in acoustic measurements and as perceived by humans, point toward the soundscape being a crucial component of a comprehensive urban design strategy that aims to improve health and quality of life for increasingly large and dense populations in the future","Lenzi, S.; Sadaba, J.; Lindborg, P.",Frontiers in Psychology,26,1

Increasing data indicate that the disease presents in a severe form in patients with pre-existing chronic conditions like cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, respiratory system diseases, and renal diseases. This indicates that these patients seem to be more susceptible to COVID-19 and have higher mortality rates compared to patients with no comorbid conditions. Several factors can explain the heightened susceptibility to and fatal presentation of COVID-19 in these patients, for example, the enhanced expression of the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptor (ACE2) in specific organs, cytokine storm, and drug interactions contribute to the increased morbidity and mortality. Adding to the findings that individuals with pre-existing conditions may be more susceptible to COVID-19, it has also been shown that COVID-19 can induce chronic diseases in previously healthy patients. Therefore, understanding the interlinked relationship between COVID-19 and chronic diseases helps in optimizing the management of susceptible patients. This review comprehensively described the molecular mechanisms that contribute to worse COVID-19 prognosis in patients with pre-existing comorbidities such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, gastrointestinal and renal diseases, blood disorders, autoimmune diseases and finally, obesity. It also focused on how COVID-19 could, in some cases, lead to chronic conditions as a result of long-term multi-organ damage. Lastly, this work carefully discusses the tailored management plans for each specific patient population, aiming to achieve the best therapeutic outcome with minimum complications.","Alyammahi, Shatha K; Abdin, Shifaa M; Alhamad, Dima W; Elgendy, Sara M; Altell, Amani T; Omar, Hany A",Infect Genet Evol,26,1

Here, it is addressed by modeling and simulation approaches guided by classic ecological theories and by treating the COVID-19 pandemic as a metapopulation dynamics problem. Three classic ecological theories are harnessed, including TPL (Taylor's power-law) and Ma's population aggregation critical density (PACD) for spatiotemporal aggregation/stability scaling, approximating virus metapopulation dynamics with Hubbell's neutral theory, and Ma's diversity-time relationship adapted for the infection-time relationship. Fisher-Information for detecting critical transitions and tipping points are also attempted. It is discovered that: (i) TPL aggregation/stability scaling parameter (b > 2), being significantly higher than the b-values of most macrobial and microbial species including SARS, may interpret the chaotic pandemic of COVID-19. (ii) The infection aggregation critical threshold (M 0) adapted from PACD varies with time (outbreak-stage), space (region) and public-health interventions. Exceeding M 0, local contagions may become aggregated and connected regionally, leading to epidemic/pandemic. (iii) The ratio of fundamental dispersal to contagion numbers can gauge the relative importance between local contagions vs. regional migrations in spreading infections. (iv) The inflection (turning) points, pair of maximal infection number and corresponding time, are successfully predicted in more than 80% of Chinese provinces and 68 countries worldwide, with a precision >80% generally.","Ma, Zhanshan Sam",Adv Sci (Weinh),26,23

We aim to estimate inequities in infection fatality rates (IFR) in New Zealand by ethnicity. METHODS: We combine existing demographic and health data for ethnic groups in New Zealand with international data on COVID-19 IFR for different age groups. We adjust age-specific IFRs for differences in unmet healthcare need, and comorbidities by ethnicity. We also adjust for life expectancy reflecting evidence that COVID-19 amplifies the existing mortality risk of different groups. RESULTS: The IFR for Maori is estimated to be 50% higher than that of non-Maori, and could be even higher depending on the relative contributions of age and underlying health conditions to mortality risk. CONCLUSIONS: There are likely to be significant inequities in the health burden from COVID-19 in New Zealand by ethnicity. These will be exacerbated by racism within the healthcare system and other inequities not reflected in official data. Highest risk communities include those with elderly populations, and Maori and Pacific communities.

During May 2020, the authors examined intended vaccination in the next 12 months in relationship to demographic variables, healthcare attitudes, and personal COVID-19 experiences for two samples of adults--those who did not receive influenza vaccine during the prior 12 months, and those who did. METHODS: In May 2020, a cross-sectional online survey was conducted with a national US sample. Participants reported prior influenza vaccination (yes/no during prior 12 months) and anticipated vaccination (yes/no during next 12 months). Covariates included demographic characteristics (e.g., gender, race-ethnicity, political ideology), general beliefs (e.g., benefits of vaccines, altruistic attitudes), and COVID-19 health beliefs and experiences (COVID-19 worry and severity, perception of COVID-19 as a community threat, knowing someone with COVID-19). For each group, hierarchical multivariable logistic regression was conducted with intent to vaccinate as the outcome. RESULTS: Among participants (n = 3502), 47% did not receive influenza vaccine in the prior 12 months and 53% had; 25.5% of non-vaccinators and 91.9% of vaccinators intended future vaccination. For non-vaccinators, odds of intending vaccination was associated with race/ethnicity (Hispanics were more likely to intend than white-NH; AOR = 1.74; 95% CI = 1.23-2.4), greater perceived benefits of vaccination (AOR = 2.19; 95% CI = 1.88-2.54), and perception of COVID-19 as a community threat (AOR = 1.91; 95% CI = 1.49-2.45). For vaccinators, odds of intending vaccination was associated with age (AOR = 1.04; 95% CI = 1.03-1.05), race/ethnicity (Black-NH and Other-NH were less likely to intend than white-NH, AOR = 0.60; 95% CI = 0.36-0.999; and AOR = 0.45; 95% CI = 0.24-0.84, respectively), greater perceived benefits of vaccination (AOR = 1.88; 95% CI = 1.45-2.45) and greater perception of collective benefits of vaccines (AOR = 1.48; 95% CI = 1.15-1.90). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic may have served as a cue to action for influenza vaccination intention among some prior non-vaccinators whereas intention among prior vaccinators is more related to positive attitudes toward vaccination.","Sturm, Lynne; Kasting, Monica L; Head, Katharine J; Hartsock, Jane A; Zimet, Gregory D",Vaccine,26,25

Many studies have shown machine learning models to be effective at detecting lung nodules from chest X-ray images. However, these techniques have yet to be embraced by the medical community due to several practical, ethical, and regulatory constraints stemming from the black-box nature of deep learning models. Additionally, most lung nodules visible on chest X-ray are benign; therefore, the narrow task of computer vision-based lung nodule detection cannot be equated to automated lung cancer detection. Addressing both concerns, this study introduces a novel hybrid deep learning and decision tree-based computer vision model which presents lung cancer malignancy predictions as interpretable decision trees. The deep learning component of this process is trained using a large publicly available dataset on pathological biomarkers associated with lung cancer. These models are then used to inference biomarker scores for chest X-ray images from two, independent data sets for which malignancy metadata is available. We mine multi-variate predictive models by fitting shallow decision trees to the malignancy stratified datasets and interrogate a range of metrics to determine the best model. Our best decision tree model achieves sensitivity and specificity of 86.7% and 80.0% respectively with a positive predictive value of 92.9%. Decision trees mined using this method may be considered as a starting point for refinement into clinically useful multi-variate lung cancer malignancy models for implementation as a workflow augmentation tool to improve the efficiency of human radiologists.","Horry, Michael J.; Chakraborty, Subrata; Pradhan, Biswajeet; Paul, Manoranjan; Gomes, Douglas P.

The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is commonly used as a measure for the effectiveness of diagnostic markers. We develop six nonparametric estimators of the AUC with/without utilizing tie information based on different approaches. We then compare the estimators using a Monte Carlo simulation and an empirical study with real data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.

We have developed a novel aerosol barrier mask (ABM) to mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and other infectious pathogens. This Aerosol Barrier Mask is designed for preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission while transporting patients within hospital facilities. This mask can constrain aerosol and droplet particles and trap them in a biofilter, while the patient is normally breathing and administrated with medical oxygen. The system can be characterized as an oxygen delivery and mitigation mask which has no unfiltered exhaled air dispersion. The mask helps to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2, and potentially other infectious respiratory pathogens and protects everyone in general, especially healthcare professionals.","Abi Karam, Karam; Hota, Piyush; Mora, S Jimena; Lowell, Amelia; McKay, Kelly; Xian, Xiaojun; Patel, Bhavesh; Forzani, Erica",Respir Med,26,24

In this study, our aim was to establish whether NF2F clinics are sustainable according to the ""triple bottom line"" framework by taking into account the impact on patients, the planet, and the financial cost. Methodology This retrospective cohort study was carried out at a large district general hospital with 261 patients identified as having undergone face-to-face (F2F) or NF2F orthopedic consultations (April 2020). These patients were contacted by telephone to establish their experience, mode of transport, and preference for future consultations. Data were also collected relating to environmental and financial costs to the patient and the trust. Results The final analysis included 180 (69%) patients: 42% had an F2F consultation and 58% NF2F consultation. There was no significant difference between each group in terms of convenience, ease of communication, subjective patient safety, or overall satisfaction rating (p &gt; 0.05). Overall, 80% of NF2F patients would be happy with virtual consultations in the future. The mean journey distance was 18.6 miles leading to a reduction in total carbon emissions of 563.9 kgCO(2)e (66%), equating to 2,106 miles in a medium-sized car. The hospital visit carbon cost (heating, lighting, and waste generation) was reduced by 3,967 kgCO(2)e (58%). The financial cost (petrol and parking) was also reduced by an average of 8.96 pound per person. Conclusions NF2F consultations are aligned to the National Health Service's ""Long Term Plan"": (i) delivering high patient satisfaction with equivalent outcomes as F2F consultations;(ii) reducing carbon emissions from transportation and hospital running;and (iii) becoming cheaper.","Curtis, A.; Parwaiz, H.; Winkworth, C.; Sweeting, L.; Pallant, L.; Davoudi, K.; Smith, E.; Chin, K.; Kelsey, M.; Stevenson, A.",Cureus,26,1

METHODS: The CONCEPTION study was a cohort, multidisciplinary study conducted at Conception University Hospital, in France, from March 17th to May 11th, 2020. Our study included all adult patients who underwent minor surgery in one of the seven surgical departments of our hospital: urology, digestive, plastic, gynecological, otolaryngology, gynecology or maxillofacial surgery. Preoperative self-isolation, clinical assessment using a standardized questionnaire, physical examination, nasopharyngeal RT-PCR and chest CT scan performed the day before surgery were part of our active prevention strategy. The main outcome was the occurrence of a SARS-CoV-2 infection within 21 days following surgery. The COVID-19 status of patients after discharge was updated during the postoperative consultation and to ensure the accuracy of data, all patients were contacted again by telephone. RESULTS: A total of 551 patients from six different specialized surgical Departments in our tertiary care center were enrolled in our study. More than 99% (546/551) of included patients underwent a complete preoperative Covid-19 screening including RT-PCR testing and chest CT scan upon admission to the Hospital. All RT-PCR tests were negative and in 12 cases (2.2%), preoperative chest CT scans detected pulmonary lesions consistent with the diagnosis criteria for COVID-19. No scheduled surgery was postponed. One patient (0.2%) developed a SARS-CoV-2 infection 20 days after a renal transplantation. No readmission or COVID-19 -related death within 30 days from surgery was recorded. CONCLUSIONS: Minor surgery remained safe in the COVID-19 Era, as long as all appropriate protective measures were implemented.

Light-propulsion occurs as consequence of the coupling between the chirality of polymeric particles - left (L)- or right (R)-type - and the circularly-polarized light that irradiates them. Irradiation with light that has the same helicity as the particle material leads to a circular cooperative vortical motion between the chiral Brownian particles. In contrast, opposite circular-polarization does not induce such coupling among the particles but only affects their Brownian motion. The mean angular momentum of each particle has a value and sign that distinguishes between chiral activity dynamics and typical Brownian motion. These outcomes have relevant implications for chiral separation technologies and provide new strategies for optical torque tunability in mesoscopic optical array systems, micro- and nanofabrication of light-activated engines with selective control and collective motion.","Hernández, Raúl Josué; Sevilla, Francisco J; Mazzulla, Alfredo; Pagliusi, Pasquale; Pellizzi, Nicola; Cipparrone, Gabriella",,26,29

As previously observed with other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 deeply dysregulate the immune system eliciting respiratory failure and a state of systemic hyperinflammation in severely ill individuals. Immunotherapy is often used to downgrade the detrimental effects of the disease sustained by high-level of cytokines. Those treatments, however, are known to undermine patients' ability to contain tuberculosis (TB) infection. This study aims to describe interferon-Î³ release assay (IGRA) results in severe COVID-19 patients eligible for immunosuppressive treatment. Aggregate data were gathered from five hospitals in Milan, Italy, from March 1 to May 15, 2020 and retrospectively analyses. Results were summarized using absolute frequencies and percentages and compared using a two-sided Chi-squared test. Overall, 462 COVID-19 patients were eligible for immunosuppressive therapy, among which 335 were tested using IGRA testing. More than one-third of them (122/335; 36.4%) had an indeterminate IGRA result because of insufficient immune response to mitogen control, 19 (5.7%) tested positive and 194 (57.9) negative. The majority of patients with lymphocytopenia (i.e., total lymphocyte count [TLC] below 1000â¯cells/mm3) had indeterminate IGRAs (81/155; 52.3%). The proportion becomes even higher in patients with severe lymphocytopenia (i.e., TLC<500â¯cells/mm3) (36/57; 63%). Our results suggest a possible negative impact of COVID-19 related immune dysregulation on TB infection assessment and management. Close monitoring of individuals with or without retesting of individuals with indeterminate IGRAs and further basic science investigations should to be sought to better comprehend their implication on TB epidemiology.","Torre, Alessandro; Aliberti, Stefano; Castellotti, Paola Francesca; Cirillo, Daniela Maria; Grisolia, Antonella; Mangioni, Davide; Marchetti, Giulia; Rossotti, Roberto; Santus, Pierachille; Besozzi, Giorgio; Villa, Simone; Codecasa, Luigi Ruffo",Respir Med,26,30

PED causes lethal watery diarrhea in piglets, which has led to substantial economic losses in many countries and is a great threat to the global swine industry. Interferons (IFNs) are major cytokines involved in host innate immune defense, which induce the expression of a broad range of antiviral effectors that help host to control and antagonize viral infections. PEDV infection does not elicit a robust IFN response, and some of the mechanisms used by the virus to counteract the host innate immune response have been unraveled. PEDV evades the host innate immune response by two main strategies including: (1) encoding IFN antagonists to disrupt innate immune pathway, and (2) hiding its viral RNA to avoid the exposure of viral RNA to immune sensors. This review highlights the immune evasion mechanisms employed by PEDV, which provides insights for the better understanding of PEDV-host interactions and developing effective vaccines and antivirals against CoVs.","Li, Shasha; Yang, Jinping; Zhu, Zixiang; Zheng, Haixue",,26,15

Many factors diminish access to education and prevention technologies emerging to combat COVID-19. For farmers, advanced age and rural location play a part. Farmworkers encounter numerous additional barriers including language and cultural differences, socioeconomic pressures, and immigration status. The unusual persistence and multiple transmission pathways of SARS-CoV-2 emerging from ongoing scientific study require customization of otherwise standard prevention messaging to farmers and farmworkers to prevent infection and disease exacerbation. AgriSafe Network and Migrant Clinicians Network, both national organizations and major stakeholders in agricultural health, are on the front lines of translating science into practical prevention strategies for those providing health services to farmworkers and farmers.

Therefore, we search for a more global analysis of antihypertensive medication in relation to SAS-CoV-2 severity using prescription data worldwide. The association between the percentage use of different types of antihypertensive medications and mortality rates due to a SARS-CoV-2 infection during the first 3 weeks of the pandemic was analyzed using random effects linear regression models for 30 countries worldwide. Higher percentages of prescribed angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) (ß, 95% confidence interval [CI]; -0.02 [-0.04 to -0.0012]; p = .042) and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) (ß, 95% CI; -0.023 [-0.05 to -0.0028]; p = .0304) were associated with a lower first 3-week SARS-CoV-2-related death rate, whereas a higher percentage of prescribed angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) (ß, 95% CI; 0.03 [0.0061-0.05]; p = .0103) was associated with a higher first 3-week death rate, even when adjusted for age and metformin use. There was no association between the amount of prescribed beta-blockers (BBs) and diuretics (Diu) and the first 3-week death rate. When analyzing the combination of drugs that is used by at least 50% of antihypertensive users, within the different countries, countries with the lowest first 3-week death rates had at least an angiotensin receptor blocker as one of the most often prescribed antihypertensive medications (ARBs/CCBs: [ß, 95% CI; -0.02 [-0.03 to -0.004]; p = .009], ARBs/BBs: [ß, 95% CI; -0.03 [-0.05 to -0.006]; p = .01]). Finally, countries prescribing high-potency ARBs had lower first 3-week ARBs. In conclusion, ARBs and CCB seem to have a protective effect against death from SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Singh, Sandeep; Widrich, Christine; Nap, Martijn; Schokker, Emile; Zwinderman, Aeilko H; Pinto-Sietsma, Sara-Joan",J Med Virol,26,23

This study examined the factors associated with difficulties in accessing HIV services during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An online survey of 236 Chinese-speaking gay and bisexual men in Hong Kong conducted in 2020. RESULTS: Among those who expressed a need to access HIV services during the COVID-19 pandemic, 22.9%, 33.9% and 43.2% indicated moderate-to-high, mild and no difficulties in accessing these services, respectively. Difficulties in accessing HIV services were positively related to concerns about potential COVID-19 infection, experience of actual impact on health because of COVID-19, disruption in work/studies, and reduced connection to the LGBT+ community during the pandemic. It was also found that difficulties in accessing HIV services were positively associated with frequency of having sex with casual partners, but were not significantly associated with frequency of having sex with regular partners. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides novel empirical evidence for understanding difficulties in accessing HIV services during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The hybrid model was considered a mid-risk option compared with remote and in-person learning models. The current study assesses school-based coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread in the early fall using a national data set. METHODS: We assess COVID-19 case growth rates from August 10 to October 14, 2020 based on a crowdsourcing data set from the National Education Association. The study follows a retrospective cohort design with the baseline exposures being 3 teaching models: remote learning only, hybrid, and in-person learning. To assess the consistency of our findings, we estimated the overall, as well as region-specific (Northeast, Midwest, South, and West) and poverty-specific (low, mid, and high) COVID-19 case-growth rates. In addition, we validated our study sample using another national sample survey data. RESULTS: The baseline was from 617 school districts in 48 states, where 47% of school districts were in hybrid, 13% were in remote, and 40% were in-person. Controlling for state-level risk and rural-urban difference, the case growth rates for remote and in-person were lower than the hybrid (odds ratio [OR]: 0.963, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.960-0.965 and OR: 0.986, 95% CI: 0.984-0.988, respectively). A consistent result was found among school districts in all 4 regions and each poverty level. CONCLUSIONS: Hybrid may not necessarily be the next logical option when transitioning from the remote to in-person learning models due to its consistent higher case growth rates than the other 2 learning models.","Liu, Dong; Lin, Ge; Sun, Xiaoting; Du, Yi; Liu, Han; Qu, Ming",J Sch Health,26,24

There are currently no efficacious drugs targeting coronavirus disease 2019, therefore, it is an urgent requirement for the development of drugs to control this emerging disease. Owing to the importance of nucleocapsid protein, the present study focuses on targeting the N-terminal domain of nucleocapsid protein from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 to identify the potential compounds by computational approaches such as pharmacophore modeling, virtual screening, docking and molecular dynamics. We found three molecules (ZINC000257324845, ZINC000005169973 and ZINC000009913056), which adopted a similar conformation as guanosine monophosphate (GMP) within the N-terminal domain active site and exhibiting high binding affinity (>-8.0 kcalmol-1). All the identified compounds were stabilized by hydrogen bonding with Arg107, Tyr111 and Arg149 of N-terminal domain. Additionally, the aromatic ring of lead molecules formed &#960; interactions with Tyr109 of N-terminal domain. Molecular dynamics and Molecular mechanic/Poisson-Boltzmann surface area results revealed that N-terminal domain - ligand(s) complexes are less dynamic and more stable than N-terminal domain - GMP complex. As the identified compounds share the same corresponding pharmacophore properties, therefore, the present results may serve as a potential lead for the development of inhibitors against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.

This includes a majority of undocumented cases of COVID-19, which were classified as mild or moderate and received little to no clinical care during the course of illness. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to document and glean insights from the experiences of individuals with a first-hand experience in dealing with COVID-19, especially the so-called mild-to-moderate cases that self-resolved while in isolation. METHODS: This web-based survey study called C19 Insider Scoop recruited adult participants aged 18 years or older who reside in the United States and had tested positive for COVID-19 or antibodies. Participants were recruited through various methods, including online support groups for COVID-19 survivors, advertisement in local news outlets, as well as through professional and other networks. The main outcomes measured in this study included knowledge of contraction or transmission of the virus, symptoms, and personal experiences on the road to recovery. RESULTS: A total of 72 participants (female, n=53; male, n=19; age range: 18-73 years; mean age: 41 [SD 14] years) from 22 US states were enrolled in this study. The top known source of how people contracted SARS-CoV-2, the virus known to cause COVID-19, was through a family or household member (26/72, 35%). This was followed by essential workers contracting the virus through the workplace (13/72, 18%). Participants reported up to 27 less-documented symptoms that they experienced during their illness, such as brain or memory fog, palpitations, ear pain or discomfort, and neurological problems. In addition, 47 of 72 (65%) participants reported that their symptoms lasted longer than the commonly cited 2-week period even for mild cases of COVID-19. The mean recovery time of the study participants was 4.5 weeks, and exactly one-half of participants (50%) still experienced lingering symptoms of COVID-19 after an average of 65 days following illness onset. Additionally, 37 (51%) participants reported that they experienced stigma associated with contracting COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents preliminary findings suggesting that emphasis on family or household spread of COVID-19 may be lacking and that there is a general underestimation of the recovery time even for mild cases of illness with the virus. Although a larger study is needed to validate these results, it is important to note that as more people experience COVID-19, insights from COVID-19 survivors can enable a more informed public, pave the way for others who may be affected by the virus, and guide further research.","Prioleau, Temiloluwa",JMIR Form Res,26,28

In this eye-tracking study, we investigated how participants (N = 54) looked at faces of individuals presented as “COVID-19 Free”, “Sick with COVID-19”, or “Recovered from COVID-19”. Results showed that participants tend to look at the eyes of COVID-19-free faces longer than at those of both COVID-19-related faces. Crucially, we also found an increase of visual attention for the mouth of the COVID-19-related faces, possibly due to the threatening characterisation of such area as a transmission vehicle for SARS-CoV-2. Thus, by detailing how people dynamically changed the way of looking at faces as a function of the perceived risk of contagion, we provide the first evidence in the literature about the impact of the pandemic on the most basic level of social interaction.","Federico, Giovanni Ferrante Donatella Marcatto Francesco Brandimonte Maria Antonella",PeerJ,26,1

We propose a new combination of a covariance tuning algorithm with existing PCA-type data compression approaches, either observation- or information-based, with the aim of reducing the computational cost of real-time updating at each assimilation step. Relying on a local assumption of flow-independent error covariances, dynamical assimilation residuals are used to adjust the covariance in each assimilation window. The estimated covariances then contribute to better specify the principal components of either the observation dynamics or the state-observation sensitivity. The proposed approaches are first validated on a shallow water twin experiment with correlated and non-homogeneous observation error. Proper selection of flow-independent assimilation windows, together with sampling density for background error estimation, and sensitivity of the approaches to the observations error covariance knowledge, are also discussed and illustrated with various numerical tests and results. The method is then applied to a more challenging industrial hydrological model with real-world data and a non-linear transformation operator provided by an operational precipitation-flow simulation software.","Cheng, Sibo; Lucor, Didier; Argaud, Jean-Philippe",,26,17

METHOD: We evaluated lymphocyte subsets and other clinical features of COVID-19 patients, and analyzed their potential impacts on COVID-19 outcomes. RESULTS: 1. Lymphocyte subset counts in the peripheral blood of patients with COVID-19 were significantly reduced, especially in patients with severe disease. 2. In patients with non-severe disease, the time from symptom onset to hospital admission was positively correlated with total T cell counts. 3. Among COVID-19 patients who did not reach the composite endpoint, lymphocyte subset counts were higher than in patients who had reached the composite endpoint. 4. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed significant differences in COVID-19 patients, classified by the levels of total, CD8+, and CD4+ T cells at admission. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that total, CD8+, and CD4+ T cell counts in patients with COVID-19 were significantly reduced, especially in patients with severe disease. Lower T lymphocyte subsets were significantly associated with a higher occurrence of composite endpoint events.

This study aimed to investigate the clinical significance of liver blood tests in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: The analysis included clinical data of 23 patients with suspected COVID-19 and 66 patients with confirmed COVID-19 from January 25 to February 20, 2020. The relationship between liver blood test results, liver condition (HBsAb positive, HBcAb positive, and fatty liver disease), and duration of hospital stay among COVID-19 patients was analyzed. RESULTS: The median hospital stay of COVID-19 patients was 6 days. Serum albumin (Alb) level was lower in patients with COVID-19 confirmed on admission than in patients with suspected COVID-19 (40.08 g/L vs 42.50 g/L, P = .016), while the level of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was higher (23 U/L vs 18 U/L, P = .005). Abnormal results of liver blood tests in patients with COVID-19 included increased levels of alanine transaminase (ALT) (21.2%, 14 patients), AST (15.2%, 10 patients), and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) (22.7%, 15 patients). After 5-10 days of treatment, levels of Alb and AST in COVID-19 patients were significantly decreased (P < .001 and P = .027, respectively). Abnormal levels of Alb and AST in patients with COVID-19 were not associated with the liver condition (all P > .05). In addition, only levels of AST were positively correlated with the duration of hospital stay (r = .334, P = .007). CONCLUSION: Abnormal results of the liver blood test were found in COVID-19 patients. The COVID-19 patients on admission with the higher levels of AST might have longer hospital stays.","Gu, Xuexiang; Li, Xiangyu; An, Xusheng; Yang, Shufeng; Wu, Shangnong; Yang, Xiaozhong; Wang, Honggang",J Clin Lab Anal,26,18

Objectives. To investigate the impact of lockdown measures on the number of patients who visited a tertiary urban trauma centre. Methods. The period of investigation was from 1 February to 30 June 2020 and was segmented into three intervals: pre-lockdown (February and March 2020), hard lockdown (April and May 2020) and immediately post lockdown (June 2020). The electronic HECTIS health record registry was interrogated for the total number of patients that were seen per month. These were further categorised according to mechanism of injury (stab, gunshot, blunt assault and road traffic injuries). Penetrating (stab and gunshot) and blunt assault victims were collectively grouped as violent trauma. Results. The mean total number of patients seen decreased by 53% during the hard lockdown period. There was a moderate reduction (15%) in patients with gunshot injuries seen during the hard lockdown phase, but there was an 80% increase in the post-lockdown period. The proportion of patients injured in road traffic collisions pre lockdown, hard lockdown and immediate post lockdown was 16.4%, 8.9% and 11.1%, respectively. Patients injured in road traffic collisions decreased by 74% during the hard lockdown period and maintained a reduction of 32% during the immediate post-lockdown period. The mean total number of patients who visited the trauma unit returned to pre-lockdown levels in June. Conclusions. There was an overall trend of reduced number of patients who visited the trauma unit during the hard lockdown period; however, these numbers returned to pre-lockdown levels during the immediate post-lockdown period. The number of road traffic injury admissions remained reduced during all three phases of lockdown, while the number of gunshot victims increased substantially during the post-lockdown period.","Navsaria, P H; Nicol, A J; Parry, C D H; Matzopoulos, R; Maqungo, S; Gaudin, R",S Afr Med J,26,24

In this research work, we propose a deep-learning prediction model for evaluating and predicting the impact of various lockdown policies on daily COVID-19 cases. This is achieved by first clustering countries having similar lockdown policies, then training a prediction model based on the daily cases of the countries in each cluster along with the data describing their lockdown policies. Once the model is trained, it can used to evaluate several scenarios associated to lockdown policies and investigate their impact on the predicted COVID cases. Our evaluation experiments, conducted on Qatar as a use case, shows that the proposed approach achieved competitive prediction accuracy.

The virulence mechanisms associated with Staphylococcus aureus biofilms are becoming better understood. Human neutrophils are critical for the innate immune response to S. aureus infection. Here we describe two virulence strategies that converge to promote the ability of S. aureus biofilms to evade killing by neutrophils. Specifically, we show that while neutrophils exposed to S. aureus biofilms produce extracellular traps (NETs) and phagocytose bacteria, both mechanisms are inefficient in clearance of the biofilm biomass. This is attributed to the leukocidin LukAB, which promotes S. aureus survival during phagocytosis. We also show that the persistence of biofilm bacteria trapped in NETs is facilitated by S. aureus nuclease (Nuc)-mediated degradation of NET DNA. This study describes key aspects of the interaction between primary human neutrophils and S. aureus biofilms and provides insight for how S. aureus evades the neutrophil response to cause persistent infections.","Bhattacharya, Mohini; Berends, Evelien T M; Zheng, Xuhui; Hill, Preston J; Chan, Rita; Torres, Victor J; Wozniak, Daniel J",Infect. immun,26,29

BCG vaccine appears to be one of the candidate immunostimulants in this regard. At the same time, other microbe-derived preparations capable of inducing a state of trained immunity deserve attention. BCG and other bacterial immunostimulatory agents containing a large number of biologically active subunits have long been considered as objects of search for promising pharmacological substances. The review analyzes the linkages between BCG, mycobacterial adjuvants, bacterial lysates, trained immunity, muramylpeptides (MPs) and NOD2 receptors in light of the choice of a low molecular weight alternative to multicomponent bacterial immunostimulants for ARI prevention during the COVID-19 pandemic. The search for key molecules by which bacteria stimulate innate and adaptive immune responses proceeds in a spiral. On different loops of this spiral, MPs have repeatedly reproduced the nonspecific effects of multicomponent bacterial adjuvants, vaccines and immunostimulants. MPs and peptidoglycans containing MPs determine the adjuvant properties of the cell walls of mycobacteria and their peptide-glycolipid fraction (wax D). MPs were able to replace Mycobacterium tuberculosis in complete Freunds adjuvant. MPs determine the NOD2-dependent ability of BCG to induce trained immunity. Probably, MPs provide NOD2-mediated long-term prophylactic action of bacterial lysates. All of the above has prompted revisiting the previously obtained evidence of the efficacy of glucosaminylmuramyl dipeptide (GMDP) as a NOD2 agonist in treatment/prevention of respiratory infections. We speculate here that MPs, in particular GMDP, at rational dosing regimens will be able to reproduce many aspects of the nonspecific effects of BCG and multicomponent bacterial immunostimulants in preventing ARI during the COVID-19 pandemic and in the post-pandemic period.","Kalyuzhin, O V; Andronova, T M; Karaulov, A V",Ter Arkh,26,1

This study used the effort-reward imbalance model to investigate the association between work-stress characteristics (effort, over-commitment, reward) and mental health problems (anxiety and depression) among front-line public health workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. METHODS: A total of 4850 valid online questionnaires were collected through a self- constructed sociodemographic questionnaire, the adapted ERI questionnaire, the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the 7-item General Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7). Hierarchical logistic regression analysis was conducted to investigate the association between ERI factors and mental health problems (i.e., depression and anxiety), with reward treated as a potential moderator in such associations. RESULTS: The data showed that effort and over-commitment were positively associated with depression and anxiety, while reward was negatively associated with depression and anxiety. Development and job acceptance were the two dimensions of reward buffered the harmful effect of effort/over-commitment on depression and anxiety, whereas esteem was non-significant. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed the harmful effects of effort and over-commitment on mental health among public health workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. Such effects could be alleviated through an appropriate reward system, especially the development and job acceptance dimensions of such a system. These findings highlight the importance of establishing an emergency reward system, comprising reasonable work-allocation mechanism, bonuses and honorary titles, a continuous education system and better career-development opportunities.","Zhang, Jing; Wang, Yijing; Xu, Jingdong; You, Hua; Li, Yan; Liang, Yuan; Li, Shan; Ma, Lina; Lau, Joseph Tak-Fai; Hao, Yuantao; Chen, Shilin; Zeng, Jing; Li, Jinghua; Gu, Jing",BMC Psychol,26,24

Nonetheless, the highly pathogenic viruses need to be handled in a high level of biosafety containment, which hinders vaccine development. To shorten the timeframe of vaccine development, the pseudovirus system has been widely applied to examine vaccine efficacy or immunogenicity in the emerging and re-emerging viruses. METHODS: We developed pseudovirus systems for emerging SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and re-emerging avian influenza virus H5 subtypes which can be handled in the biosafety level 2 facility. Through the generated pseudovirus of SARS-CoV-2 and avian influenza virus H5 subtypes, we successfully established a neutralization assay to quantify the neutralizing activity of antisera against the viruses. RESULTS: The result of re-emerging avian influenza virus H5Nx pseudoviruses provided valuable information for antigenic evolution and immunogenicity analysis in vaccine candidate selection. Together, our study assessed the potency of pseudovirus systems in vaccine efficacy, antigenic analysis, and immunogenicity in the vaccine development of emerging and re-emerging viruses. CONCLUSION: Instead of handling live highly pathogenic viruses in a high biosafety level facility, using pseudovirus systems would speed up the process of vaccine development to provide community protection against emerging and re-emerging viral diseases with high pathogenicity.","Huang, Sheng-Wen; Tai, Ching-Hui; Hsu, Yin-Mei; Cheng, Dayna; Hung, Su-Jhen; Chai, Kit Man; Wang, Ya-Fang; Wang, Jen-Ren",Biomed J,26,1

In case of Senegal, the country was already facing number of challenges at the inception of the pandemic, including high rates of poverty, prevalence of food insecurity, combined with other biophysical and socioeconomic challenges faced generally in Sub-Saharan Africa. OBJECTIVE: To understand farmer perceptions of the potential impacts of COVID-19 on agricultural systems and social well-being of smallholder farmers in Senegal. Particular attention was given to potential vulnerabilities and resilience in the targeted farming systems. METHODS: A survey was developed to better understand smallholder farmer perceptions regarding the anticipated impacts of COVID-19 on their agriculture practices and social well-being. The survey was administered (between June 5 and June 20) with smallholder farmers (nâ¯=â¯872) in 14 regions covering all agroecological zones. Variables of interest included perceptions of potential impact on farming systems, agricultural productivity, communities, economics, markets, labor, gendered division of labor, food security, and community well-being. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Across the three farming systems examined (cropping, livestock, and horticulture) significant majorities expressed concerns related to access to inputs, ability to plant (cropping, horticulture), reduction of yields (cropping, horticulture), ability to feed livestock, ability to sell livestock, and the ability to hire labor (horticulture). The majority of respondents also expressed concern that COVID-19 would make it more difficult to get enough food on a regular basis for their household (82.5%); that the markets where they purchase food will either be closed or significantly disrupted (79.5%); that the price of food would increase (73.5%); and the market where they sell their produce/livestock will be either closed or significantly disrupted (73.2%). SIGNIFICANCE: Anticipated impacts of COVID-19 on agriculture will be felt on both the biophysical aspects such as production and access to inputs and socioeconomic aspects such as access to labor, markets, or rapid shifts in demand. Results support the need to use farming systems approach to gather perceived and actual impacts of COVID-19 and warrants a more in-depth examination of agronomic and biophysical issues as well as the impact on the livelihoods and social well-being of families at community and household levels. Further examination will help identify the characteristics that strengthen smallholder farming systems resilience to adjust to anticipated and unanticipated shocks, such as COVID-19, to decrease the negative impacts and increase the rate of recovery.","Middendorf, B Jan; Faye, Aliou; Middendorf, Gerad; Stewart, Zachary P; Jha, Prakash K; Prasad, P V Vara",Agric Syst,26,1

However, the tone and content of communication varies across and within countries and led to conflicting results in terms of collective sensemaking. To understand how government leaders' messages shape emotional and cognitive responses of citizens, we designed a 2x2 vignette experiment in which we manipulate the framing (pessimistic vs. optimistic) and content of the message (specific vs. general) delivered by a political leader. Results from 436 participants showed that while the tone of leader's messages has significant implications for the levels of anxiety and evaluation of the government's truthfulness and its overall response to the crisis, the content of the leader's message matters less. Furthermore, these effects were particularly experienced by women and left-leaning participants. Overall, our results highlight the importance of the leader's communication strategies on influencing the public's emotional reactions, as well as the perceptions of government effectiveness in dealing with the crisis.","Sobral, Filipe; Carvalho, Juliana; amp,; 321,; agowska, Urszula; Furtado, Liliane Magalhães Girardin Pimentel; Grobman, Miriam",Rev. adm. pública (Online),26,22

The occurrence of several deleterious events, such as hyperactivation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), and oxidative and inflammatory stress, contributes to the development of small vessel disease in PAH. Small resistance arteries are found at various points through the arterial tree, act as the major site of vascular resistance, and actively regulate local tissue perfusion. Experimental and clinical studies demonstrate that alterations in small resistance artery properties are important features of PAH pathophysiology. Diseased small vessels in PAH show decreased lumens, thicker walls, endothelial dysfunction, and oxidative stress and inflammation. These events may lead to altered blood flow supply to tissues and organs, and can increase the risk of thrombosis. Notably, PAH is prevalent among patients diagnosed with COVID-19, in whom evidence of small vessel disease leading to cardiovascular pathology is reported. The SARS-Cov2 virus, responsible for COVID-19, achieves cell entry through an S (spike) high-affinity protein binding to the catalytic domain of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a negative regulator of the RAS pathway. Therefore, it is crucial to examine the relationship between small resistance artery disease, ACE2, and PAH, to understand COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. The scope of the present review is to briefly summarize available knowledge on the role of small resistance artery disease and ACE2 in PAH, and critically discuss their clinical relevance in the context of cardiovascular pathology associated to COVID-19.","Galán, María; Jiménez-Altayó, Francesc",Front Cardiovasc Med,26,20

DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of nationally representative survey data. SETTING: Internet survey conducted between 25 August and 30 September 2020 in Japan. Sampling weights were used to calculate national estimates. PARTICIPANTS: 25 482 survey respondents (50.3% (12 809) women; mean (SD) age, 48.8 (17.4) years). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence rate of five symptoms indicative of the COVID-19 infection (high fever, sore throat, cough, headache, and smell and taste disorder) within the past month of the survey, after adjustment for characteristics of individuals and prefecture fixed effects (effectively comparing individuals living in the same prefecture). RESULTS: At the time of the survey, 3289 (12.9%) participated in the subsidy programme. After adjusting for potential confounders, we found that participants in the subsidy programme exhibited higher incidence of high fever (adjusted rate, 4.7% for participants vs 3.7% for non-participants; adjusted OR (aOR) 1.83; 95% CI 1.34 to 2.48; p<0.001), sore throat (19.8% vs 11.3%; aOR 2.09; 95% CI 1.37 to 3.19; p=0.002), cough (19.0% vs 11.3%; aOR 1.96; 95% CI 1.26 to 3.01; p=0.008), headache (29.2% vs 25.5%; aOR 1.24; 95% CI 1.08 to 1.44; p=0.006) and smell and taste disorder (2.6% vs 1.8%; aOR 1.98; 95% CI 1.15 to 3.40; p=0.01) compared with non-participants. These findings remained qualitatively unaffected by additional adjustment for the use of 17 preventative measures (eg, social distancing, wearing masks and handwashing) and fear against the COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSIONS: The participation of the government subsidy programme for domestic travel was associated with a higher probability of exhibiting symptoms indicative of the COVID-19 infection.","Miyawaki, Atsushi; Tabuchi, Takahiro; Tomata, Yasutake; Tsugawa, Yusuke",BMJ Open,26,16

Unfortunately, there is lack of clearly defined AEs associated with given procedures, and their reporting is non-uniform and often arbitrary. However, with an increasing number of neurosurgical procedures performed, there is a need for standardization of AEs for systematic tracking. Such a system would establish a baseline for future quality improvement strategies. OBJECTIVE: To review our institutional AEs and devise standardized titles specific to the spine, tumor, functional, and vascular neurosurgery divisions. METHODS: A review of prospective monthly-reported morbidity and mortality (M&M) conference data within the Department of Neurological Surgery was conducted from January 2017 to December 2019. An AE was defined as any mortality, an ""unintended and undesirable diagnostic or therapeutic event"", ""an event that prolongs the patient's hospital stay"", or an outcome with permanent or transient neurologic deficit. RESULTS: A total of 1096 AEs from 7418 total procedures (14.8 %) were identified. Of those, 418 (5.6 %) were in cerebrovascular, 249 (3.4 %) were in neuro-oncology and 429 (5.8 %) were in the spine & functional divisions. The most common AEs across all divisions were infection (17 %), hemorrhage (11 %) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak (7.8 %). Other AEs were indirectly related to the neurosurgical procedure, such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism (2.7 %), or pneumothorax (0.3 %). CONCLUSION: This work illustrates standardized AEs can be implemented universally across the spectrum of neurological surgery. Standardization can help identify recurring AE patterns through better tracking.","Al Saiegh, Fadi; Mazza, Jacob; Hafazalla, Karim; Baldassari, Michael P; Theofanis, Thana; Ye, Donald; Hoelscher, Christian; Harrop, James S; Evans, James J; Jabbour, Pascal; Rosenwasser, Robert H; Sharan, Ashwini D",Clin Neurol Neurosurg,26,1

Customers buy subscriptions, not individual pieces of content, and once subscribed they may consume many pieces of content in addition to the one(s) that drew them to the service. In this paper, we propose a scalable methodology to estimate the incremental acquisition impact of content launches in a subscription business model when randomized experimentation is not feasible. Our approach uses simple assumptions to transform the problem into an equivalent question: what is the expected consumption rate for new subscribers who did not join due to the content launch? We estimate this counterfactual rate using the consumption rate of new subscribers who joined just prior to launch, while making adjustments for variation related to subscriber attributes, the in-product experience, and seasonality. We then compare our counterfactual consumption to the actual rate in order to back out an acquisition estimate. Our methodology provides top-line impact estimates at the content / day / region grain. Additionally, to enable subscriber-level attribution, we present an algorithm that assigns specific individual accounts to add up to the top-line estimate. Subscriber-level attribution is derived by solving an optimization problem to minimize the number of subscribers attributed to more than one piece of content, while maximizing the average propensity to be incremental for subscribers attributed to each piece of content. Finally, in the absence of definitive ground truth, we present several validation methods which can be used to assess the plausibility of impact estimates generated by these methods.","Badri, Hamidreza; Kaufman, Alex",,26,17

Another concern is the lack of definitive treatment for this disease. The researchers tried different treatment options which are not specific. The current study aims to identify potential small molecule inhibitors against the main protease protein of SARS-CoV-2 by the computational approach. MAIN METHODS: In this study, a virtual screening procedure employing docking of the two different datasets from the ZINC database, including 1615 FDA approved drugs and 4266 world approved drugs were used to identify new potential small molecule inhibitors for the newly released crystal structure of main protease protein of SARS-CoV-2. In the following to validate the docking result, molecular dynamics simulations were applied on selected ligands to identify the behavior and stability of them in the binding pocket of the main protease in 150 nanoseconds (ns). Furthermore, binding energy using the MMPBSA approach was also calculated. KEY FINDINGS: The result indicates that simeprevir (Hepatitis C virus NS3/4A protease inhibitor) and pyronaridine (antimalarial agent) could fit well to the binding pocket of the main protease and because of some other beneficial features including broad-spectrum antiviral properties and ADME profile, they might be a promising drug candidate for repurposing to the treatment of COVID-19.

Using serial interval data from before and after the rollout of nonpharmaceutical interventions in China, we estimate that the relative frequency of presymptomatic transmission increased from 34% before the rollout to 71% afterward. The shift toward earlier transmission indicates a disproportionate reduction in transmission post-symptom onset. We estimate that, following the rollout of nonpharmaceutical interventions, transmission post-symptom onset was reduced by 82% whereas presymptomatic transmission decreased by only 16%. The observation that only one-third of transmission was presymptomatic at baseline, combined with the finding that NPIs reduced presymptomatic transmission by less than 20%, suggests that the overall impact of NPIs was driven in large part by reductions in transmission following symptom onset. This implies that interventions which limit opportunities for transmission in the later stages of infection, such as contact tracing and isolation, are particularly important for control of SARS-CoV-2. Interventions which specifically reduce opportunities for presymptomatic transmission, such as quarantine of asymptomatic contacts, are likely to have smaller, but non-negligible, effects on overall transmission.","Bushman, Mary Worby Colin Hsiao-Han Chang Kraemer Moritz U.

In concert with its metabolizing enzymes, particularly sphingomyelinases, it has key roles in regulating the physical properties of biological membranes, including the formation of membrane microdomains. Thus, ceramide and its related molecules have been attributed significant roles in nearly all steps of the viral life cycle: they may serve directly as receptors or co-receptors for viral entry, form microdomains that cluster entry receptors and/or enable them to adopt the required conformation or regulate their cell surface expression. Sphingolipids can regulate all forms of viral uptake, often through sphingomyelinase activation, and mediate endosomal escape and intracellular trafficking. Ceramide can be key for the formation of viral replication sites. Sphingomyelinases often mediate the release of new virions from infected cells. Moreover, sphingolipids can contribute to viral-induced apoptosis and morbidity in viral diseases, as well as virus immune evasion. Alpha-galactosylceramide, in particular, also plays a significant role in immune modulation in response to viral infections. This review will discuss the roles of ceramide and its related molecules in the different steps of the viral life cycle.

Thus, a survey aiming to investigate the use of information and communication technology (ICT) among European SCFTs was launched in 2017. A sample of 220 SCFTs was included in the survey. The majority were residents in Greece, France and Italy. Descriptive analysis compared SCFTs’ digital practices and concerns from the above three countries with those from the rest of Europe. Results showed that 81.4 per cent of European SCFTs used ICT for clinical purposes and 47.7 per cent in training and supervision. Main concerns among European SCFTs related to the quality of therapeutic relationship, ethical and legal issues, and a lack of national and transnational regulation.

The intra and intermolecular interactions which exist within these compounds are analyzed by different methods namely the topological analysis AIM, ELF and the reduced gradient of the density. These approaches make it possible in particular to study the properties of hydrogen bonds. The highest occupied molecular orbital and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy levels are constructed and the corresponding frontier energy gaps are determined to realize the charge transfer within the molecule. The densities of state diagrams were determined to calculate contributions to the molecular orbitals. The molecular electrostatic potential surfaces are determined to give a visual representation of charge distribution of these ligands and to provide information linked to electrophilic and nucleophilic sites localization.

Satellite imagery can support the decision-making of analysts and policymakers by providing a different kind of visibility into the unfolding economic changes. Such information can be useful both during the crisis and also as we recover from it. In this work, we use a deep learning approach that combines strategic location sampling and an ensemble of lightweight convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to recognize specific elements in satellite images and compute economic indicators based on it, automatically.

We thus conducted a nationwide cohort study to estimate the effects of environmental factors [temperature, particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3)] on COVID-19 case fatality. A total of 71,808 confirmed COVID-19 cases were identified and followed up for their vital status through April 25, 2020. Exposures to ambient air pollution and temperature were estimated by linking the city- and county-level monitoring data to the residential community of each participant. For each participant, two windows were defined: the period from symptom onset to diagnosis (Exposure Window â ), and the period from the diagnosis date to date of death/recovery or end of the study period (Exposure Window â ¡). Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the associations between these environmental factors and COVID-19 case fatality. COVID-19 case fatality increased in association with environmental factors for two exposure windows. For example, each 10 ug/m3 increase of PM2.5, PM10, O3 and NO2 in Window I was associated with a hazard ratio of 1.11 (95% CI: 1.09, 1.13), 1.10 (95% CI: 1.08, 1.13), 1.09 (95 CI: 1.03, 1.14) and 1.27 (95% CI: 1.19, 1.35) for COVID-19 fatality, respectively. A significant effect was also observed for low temperature, with a hazard ratio of 1.03 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.04) for COVID-19 case fatality per each 1°C decrease. Subgroup analysis indicated that these effects were stronger in the elderly, as well as those with mild symptoms and living in Wuhan or Hubei. Overall, the sensitivity analyses also yielded the consistent estimates. Short-term exposure to ambient air pollution and low temperature during the illness would play a nonnegligible part in causing case fatality of COVID-19. Reduced exposures to high concentration of PM2.5, PM10, O3, SO2 and NO2 and low temperature would help improve the prognosis and reduce public health burden.","Tian, Fei; Liu, Xiaobo; Chao, Qingchen; Qian, Zhengmin Min; Zhang, Siqi; Qi, Li; Niu, Yanlin; Arnold, Lauren D; Zhang, Shiyu; Li, Huan; Xu, Jianguo; Lin, Hualiang; Liu, Qiyong",Innovation (N Y),26,16

However, these have limited or no impact if not applied correctly through lack of knowledge, inappropriate attitude or incorrect practice. In order to maximise the impact of infection prevention and control measures on COVID-19 spread, we undertook a study to assess and improve knowledge, attitudes and practice among 119 healthcare workers and 100 general public in Thailand. The study setting was two inpatient hospitals providing COVID-19 testing and treatment. Detailed information on knowledge, attitudes and practice among the general public and healthcare workers regarding COVID-19 transmission and its prevention were obtained from a combination of questionnaires and observations. RESULTS: Knowledge of the main transmission routes, commonest symptoms and recommended prevention methods was mostly very high (> 80%) in both groups. There was lower awareness of aerosols, food and drink and pets as sources of transmission; of the correct duration for handwashing; recommended distance for social/physical distancing; and about recommended types of face coverings. Information sources most used and most trusted were the workplace, work colleagues, health workers and television. The results were used to produce a set of targeted educational videos which addressed many of these gaps with subsequent improvements on retesting in a number of areas. This included improvements in handwashing practice with an increase in the number of areas correctly washed in 65.5% of the public, and 57.9% of healthcare workers. The videos were then further optimized with feedback from participants followed by another round of retesting. CONCLUSIONS: Detailed information on gaps in knowledge, attitudes and practice among the general public and healthcare workers regarding COVID-19 transmission and its prevention were obtained from a combination of questionnaires and observations. This was used to produce targeted educational videos which addressed these gaps with subsequent improvements on retesting. The resulting videos were then disseminated as a resource to aid in efforts to fight COVID-19 in Thailand and worldwide.","Maude, Rapeephan R; Jongdeepaisal, Monnaphat; Skuntaniyom, Sumawadee; Muntajit, Thanomvong; Blacksell, Stuart D; Khuenpetch, Worarat; Pan-Ngum, Wirichada; Taleangkaphan, Keetakarn; Malathum, Kumtorn; Maude, Richard James",BMC Public Health,26,21

We characterized risk perceptions and adherence to social distancing recommendations in March 2020 among US adults aged 18+ in an online survey with age and gender quotas to match the general US population (N = 713). We used multivariable logistic and linear regression to estimate associations between age (by generational cohort) and these outcomes. The median perceived risk of infection with COVID-19 within the next month was 32%, and 65% of individuals were practicing more social distancing than before the outbreak. Baby Boomers had lower perceived risk than Millennials (-10.6%, 95% CI: -16.2%, -5.0%), yet were more frequently social distancing (OR = 1.64; 95% CI: 1.05, 2.56). Public health outreach should focus on raising compliance with social distancing recommendations, especially among high risk groups. Efforts to address risk perceptions alone may be inadequate.","Masters, Nina B; Shih, Shu-Fang; Bukoff, Allen; Akel, Kaitlyn B; Kobayashi, Lindsay C; Miller, Alison L; Harapan, Harapan; Lu, Yihan; Wagner, Abram L",PLoS One,26,2

We aim to evaluate the occurrence of pulmonary embolism among patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and to describe their risk factors, clinical characteristics, and in-hospital clinical outcomes. METHODS: This is a multicenter Italian study including 333 consecutive SARS-CoV-2 patients admitted to seven hospitals from February 22 to May 15, 2020. All the patients underwent computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) for PE detection. In particular, CTPA was performed in case of inadequate response to high-flow oxygen therapy (Fi02&#8805;0.4 to maintain Sp02&#8805;92%), elevated D-dimer (>0.5µg/mL), or echocardiographic signs of right ventricular dysfunction. Clinical, laboratory and radiological data were also analyzed. RESULTS: Among 333 patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and undergoing CTPA, PE was detected in 109 (33%) cases. At CTPA, subsegmental, segmental, lobar and central thrombi were detected in 31 (29%), 50 (46%), 20 (18%) and 8 (7%) cases, respectively. In-hospital death occurred in 29 (27%) patients in the PE-group and in 47 (21%) patients in the non-PE group (p = 0.25). Patients in PE-group had a low rate of traditional risk factors and deep vein thrombosis was detected in 29% of patients undergoing compression ultrasonography. In 71% of cases with documented PE, the thrombotic lesions were located in the correspondence of parenchymal consolidation areas. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a low rate of risk factors for venous thromboembolism, PE is present in about 1 out 3 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia undergoing CTPA for inadequate response to oxygen therapy, elevated D-dimer level, or echocardiographic signs of right ventricular dysfunction. In most of the cases, the thromboses were located distally in the pulmonary tree and were mainly confined within pneumonia areas.","Loffi, Marco; Regazzoni, Valentina; Toselli, Marco; Cereda, Alberto; Palmisano, Anna; Vignale, Davide; Moroni, Francesco; Pontone, Gianluca; Andreini, Daniele; Mancini, Elisabetta Maria; Monello, Alberto; Iannopollo, Gianmarco; Casella, Gianni; Monetti, Francesco; Monti, Lorenzo; Ferrillo, Giuseppe; Liccardo, Gaetano; Tonet, Elisabetta; Zucchetti, Ottavio; Cossu, Alberto; Dugo, Marco; Patelli, Gianluigi; Sergio, Pietro; Esposito, Antonio; Colombo, Antonio; Giannini, Francesco; Piccolo, Raffaele; Danzi, Gian Battista",PLoS One,26,11

None considered the significant impact of SARS-CoV-2 viral load on adverse outcomes. We aimed to clarify the prognostic role of NTIS among predominantly mild-to-moderate COVID-19 patients. DESIGN: A prospective study of COVID-19 patients. PATIENTS AND MEASUREMENTS: Consecutive adults admitted to Queen Mary Hospital for confirmed COVID-19 from July to December 2020 were prospectively recruited. SARS-CoV-2 viral load was represented by cycle threshold (Ct) values from real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of the respiratory specimen on admission. Serum TSH, free thyroxine and free T3 were measured on admission. The outcome was deterioration in clinical severity, defined as worsening in &#8805;1 category of clinical severity according to the Chinese National Health Commission guideline. RESULTS: We recruited 367 patients. At baseline, 75.2% had mild disease, and 27 patients (7.4%) had NTIS. Fifty-three patients (14.4%) had clinical deterioration. Patients with NTIS were older, had more comorbidities, worse symptomatology, higher SARS-CoV-2 viral loads and worse profiles of inflammatory and tissue injury markers. They were more likely to have clinical deterioration (p < .001). In multivariable stepwise logistic regression analysis, NTIS independently predicted clinical deterioration (adjusted odds ratio 3.19, p = .017), in addition to Ct value <25 (p < .001), elevated C-reactive protein (p = .004), age >50 years (p = .011) and elevated creatine kinase (p = .017). CONCLUSIONS: Non-thyroidal illness syndrome was not uncommon even in mild-to-moderate COVID-19 patients. NTIS on admission could predict clinical deterioration in COVID-19, independent of SARS-CoV-2 viral load, age and markers of inflammation and tissue injury.","Lui, David Tak Wai; Lee, Chi Ho; Chow, Wing Sun; Lee, Alan Chun Hong; Tam, Anthony Raymond; Fong, Carol Ho Yi; Law, Chun Yiu; Leung, Eunice Ka Hong; To, Kelvin Kai Wang; Tan, Kathryn Choon Beng; Woo, Yu Cho; Lam, Ching Wan; Hung, Ivan Fan Ngai; Lam, Karen Siu Ling",Clin. endocrinol,26,16

Although still much less utilized compared to computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is gaining traction in medical 3D printing. The purpose of this study was two-fold: 1) to determine the prevalence in the existing literature of using MRI to create 3D printed anatomic models for surgical planning and 2) to provide image acquisition recommendations for appropriate clinical scenarios where MRI is the most suitable imaging modality. The workflow for creating 3D printed anatomic models from medical imaging data is complex and involves image segmentation of the regions of interest and conversion of that data into 3D surface meshes, which are compatible with printing technologies. CT is most commonly used to create 3D printed anatomic models due to the high image quality and relative ease of performing image segmentation from CT data. As compared to CT datasets, 3D printing using MRI data offers advantages since it provides exquisite soft tissue contrast needed for accurate organ segmentation and it does not expose patients to unnecessary ionizing radiation. MRI, however, often requires complicated imaging techniques and time-consuming postprocessing procedures to generate high-resolution 3D anatomic models needed for 3D printing. Despite these challenges, 3D modeling and printing from MRI data holds great clinical promises thanks to emerging innovations in both advanced MRI imaging and postprocessing techniques.

It begins by conceptualising peer relationships for youth globally and considers why these are pivotal for young people living in street settings. The paper reconceptualizes street peer relationships not as replacement families, but as sharing 'social anchorage' in the street space. It draws on qualitative ethnographic data from Growing up on the Streets, a longitudinal research project with a participatory methodology undertaken between 2012 and 2016 and engaging street youth (aged 14-20 at project outset) trained in ethnographic observations as research assistants (n = 18), following a network of ten peers (n = 229 by 2016), reporting their experiences in weekly interviews with facilitators. A wider network attended focus groups (n = 399). The project engaged a 'capability' approach, with ten capabilities defined by street youth as key to their daily lives. Empirical evidence is from a subset of data qualitatively coded (using NVivo) against capabilities 'Health and Wellbeing' and 'Friendship', across all interviews, focus groups and cities (n = 212 sources). In exploring this intersection, the paper demonstrates beneficial and adverse impacts of peer influence on sexual health, including misinformation about contraceptives and death from an informal sector abortion; highlighting findings from across the three cities around primacy of same-sex peer relations, mistrust between genders and in healthcare providers. The paper finds that while street youth remain subject to cultural norms around gender identities, street peer relationships hold a persuasive power; contributing to both everyday survival and moments of acute need. It concludes that recognising the right of young people to live and seek livelihoods in urban settings, and adopting the social networks they create to advance street youth's sexual health has become even more relevant in a (post)pandemic world.","Hunter, Janine; van Blerk, Lorraine; Shand, Wayne",Soc Sci Med,26,24

Research has shown, however, that the nested three-parameter model suffers from issues of unidentifiability (San Martín et al. in Psychometrika 80:450-467, 2015), which places concern on the identifiability of the four-parameter model. Borrowing from recent advances in the identification of cognitive diagnostic models, in particular, the DINA model (Gu and Xu in Stat Sin https://doi.org/10.5705/ss.202018.0420 , 2019), a new model is proposed with restrictions inspired by this new literature to help with the identification issue. Specifically, we show conditions under which the four-parameter model is strictly and generically identified. These conditions inform the presentation of a new exploratory model, which we call the dyad four-parameter normal ogive (Dyad-4PNO) model. This model is developed by placing a hierarchical structure on the DINA model and imposing equality constraints on a priori unknown dyads of items. We present a Bayesian formulation of this model, and show that model parameters can be accurately recovered.

Among the 333 confirmed cases in Shanghai, 172 (51.7%) were males and 161 (48.3%) were females, with a median age of 50 years. 299 (89.8%) cases presented mild symptoms. 139 (41.7%) and 111 (33.3%) cases were infected in Wuhan and Shanghai, respectively. 148 (44.4%) cases once had contact with confirmed cases before onset, while 103 (30.9%) cases had never contacted confirmed cases but they had a sojourn history in Wuhan. The onset date of the first case in Shanghai was 28 December, with the peak appearing on 27 January. The median incubation period of COVID-19 was estimated to be 7.2 days. 207 (62.2%) cases had fever symptoms at the onset, whereas 273 (82.0%) cases experienced fever before hospitalization. 56 (18.6%) adults experienced a decrease in white blood cell and 84 (42.9%) had increased C-reactive protein after onset. Elderly, male and heart disease history were risk factors for severe or critical pneumonia. These findings suggest that most cases experienced fever symptoms and had mild pneumonia. Strengthening the health management of elderly men, especially those with underlying diseases, may help reduce the incidence of severe and critical pneumonia.

DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. METHODS: 114 patients with COVID-19 admitted to a mobile cabin hospital in Wuhan, Hubei Province, in February 2020 were enrolled by a convenience sampling method. The Chinese version of the Mishel Illness Uncertainty Scale (MUIS) was used to assess patients' degree of illness uncertainty, and multiple regression analysis was used to explore the influencing factors. RESULTS: The average total score of MUIS (Chinese version) was 52.22 ± 12.51, indicating a moderate level of illness uncertainty. The dimension unpredictability turned out to have the highest mean score: 2.88 ± 0.90. The multiple stepwise regression analysis showed that female (t = 2.462, p = .015), monthly family income not less than RMB 10,000 (t = -2.095, p = .039), and disease duration of 28 days or more (t = 2.249, p = .027) were independent influencing factors of illness uncertainty. CONCLUSION: Patients with COVID-19 are at a moderate level of illness uncertainty. Medical staffs should pay more attention to female patients, patients with lower monthly family income, patients with the prolonged disease, and take targeted interventions to help them reduce illness uncertainty. IMPACT: Facing the brand new and unknown infectious disease, patients confirmed of COVID-19 suffer from immense physical and psychological stress, where illness uncertainty is a major stressor that troubles patients. The present study surveys illness uncertainty among patients with COVID-19 in the mobile cabin hospital with results revealing a moderate level.

METHODS: We applied the H-Score to risk-stratify our patient to help predict his hospital course. This study was exempt from requiring specific Institutional Review Board approval, but met all the criteria required by our institution for this type of study and report including consent from the patient. RESULTS: The calculated H-Score for our patient fell below the diagnostic cut-off value for rHLH. Because rHLH is characterized by CRS, we expected him to have a milder hospital course with COVID-19. Correlating with his below cut-off H-score, the patient had a more benign than expected hospital course. CONCLUSIONS: Because this is only a single case, we plan to retrospectively review a series of patients to validate our initial experience-that a low H-Score may correlate with a milder hospital course in kidney transplant patients with COVID-19.","Adrogué, A H; Mithani, F; Ibrahim, H N; Schwartz, M R; Gaber, L; Hebert, S A; Adrogué, H E",Transplant Proc,26,24

For models with two structures, we propose a numerical technique to approximate $R_{0}$, which measures the transmissibility of an infectious disease and, rigorously, is defined as the dominant eigenvalue of a next-generation operator. Via bivariate collocation and cubature on tensor grids, the latter is approximated with a finite-dimensional matrix, so that its dominant eigenvalue can easily be computed with standard techniques. We use test examples to investigate experimentally the behavior of the approximation: the convergence order appears to be infinite when the corresponding eigenfunction is smooth, and finite for less regular eigenfunctions. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique for more realistic applications, we present a new epidemic model structured by demographic age and immunity, and study the approximation of $R_{0}$ in some particular cases of interest.","Breda, Dimitri; Reggi, Simone De; Scarabel, Francesca; Vermiglio, Rossana; Wu, Jianhong",,26,0

The pandemic also caused delayed detection of new-onset diabetes in children; this increased the risk and severity of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). We therefore investigated the frequency of new-onset pediatric T1DM and DKA in Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 pandemic and compared it to the same period in 2019. Methods: We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study, including patients aged 1-14 years admitted with new-onset T1DM or DKA during the COVID-19 pandemic (March-June 2020) and the same period in 2019. We assessed factors including age, sex, anthropometric measures, nationality, duration of diabetes, diabetes management, HbA1c levels, glycemic control, cause of admission, blood gas levels, etiology of DKA, DKA complications, length of hospital stay, and COVID-19 test status. Result: During the lockdown, 106 children, compared with 154 in 2019, were admitted to 6 pediatric diabetes centers. Among the admissions, DKA was higher in 2020 than in 2019 (83% vs. 73%; P=0.05; risk ratio=1.15; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.26), after adjusting for age and sex. DKA frequency among new-onset T1DM and HbA1c levels at diagnosis were higher in 2020 than in 2019 (26% vs. 13.4% [P=<0.001] and 12.1 ± 0.2 vs. 10.8 ± 0.25 [P<0.001], respectively). Females and older patients had a higher risk of DKA. Conclusion: The lockdown implemented in Saudi Arabia has significantly impacted children with T1DM and led to an increased DKA frequency, including children with new-onset T1DM, potentially owing to delayed presentation.","Alaqeel, Aqeel; Aljuraibah, Fahad; Alsuhaibani, Mohammed; Huneif, Mohammed; Alsaheel, Abdulhameed; Dubayee, Mohammad Al; Alsaedi, Abdulaziz; Bakkar, Ayman; Alnahari, Ahmed; Taha, Areej; Alharbi, Khulood; Alanazi, Yousef; Almadhi, Samia; Khalifah, Reem Al",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),26,24

SARS-CoV-2 highlights the global impact emergence events can have. Considering the history and diversity of coronaviruses (CoVs), especially in bats, SARS-CoV-2 will likely not be the last to spillover from animals into human populations. We sampled and tested wildlife in the central African country Cameroon to determine which CoVs are circulating and how they relate to previously detected human and animal CoVs. We collected animal and ecological data at sampling locations and used family-level consensus PCR combined with amplicon sequencing for virus detection. Between 2003 and 2018, samples were collected from 6,580 animals of several different orders. CoV RNA was detected in 175 bats, a civet, and a shrew. The CoV RNAs detected in the bats represented 17 different genetic clusters, coinciding with alpha (n=8) and beta (n=9) CoVs. Sequences resembling human CoV-229E (HCoV-229E) were found in 40 Hipposideridae bats. Phylogenetic analyses place the human derived HCoV-229E isolates closest to those from camels in terms of the S and N genes, but closest to isolates from bats for the E, M, and RdRp genes. The CoV RNA positivity rate in bats varied significantly (p<0.001) between the wet (8.2%) and dry season (4.5%). Most sampled species accordingly had a wet season high and dry season low, while for some the opposite was found. Eight of the suspected CoV species of which we detected RNA appear to be entirely novel CoV species, which suggests that CoV diversity in African wildlife is still rather poorly understood. The detection of multiple different variants of HCoV-229E-like viruses supports the bat reservoir hypothesis for this virus, with the phylogenetic results casting some doubt on camels as an intermediate host. The findings also support the previously proposed influence of ecological factors on CoV circulation, indicating a high level of underlying complexity to the viral ecology. These results indicate the importance of investing in surveillance activities among wild animals to detect all potential threats as well as sentinel surveillance among exposed humans to determine emerging threats.","Ntumvi, Nkom F; Ndze, Valantine Ngum; Gillis, Amethyst; Diffo, Joseph Le Doux; Tamoufe, Ubald; Takuo, Jean-Michel; Mouiche, Moctar M M; Nwobegahay, Julius; LeBreton, Matthew; Rimoin, Anne W; Schneider, Bradley S; Monagin, Corina; McIver, David J; Roy, Sanjit; Ayukekbong, James A; Saylors, Karen; Joly, Damien O; Wolfe, Nathan D; Rubin, Edward M; Lange, Christian E",,26,14

With several months of backlogs in appointments, there has not only been a reduction in primary samples being taken for human papilloma virus (HPV) testing but there have also been fewer women referred to colposcopy for investigation and treatment of precancerous or cancerous changes as a result. Encouraging uptake for cervical screening was always a priority before the pandemic, but it is even more important now, considering that the fears and barriers to screening that women may have are now exacerbated by COVID-19. OBJECTIVES: This article explores the impact of the pandemic on the uptake of cervical screening within NHS Ayrshire & Arran and evaluates potential strategies to improve uptake now and in future such as self-sampling and telemedicine. METHODS: This article presents evidence-based literature and local health board data relating to cervical screening during the pandemic. RESULTS: Human papilloma virus self-sampling carried out by the woman in her home has been shown to improve uptake, especially in non-attenders, whilst maintaining a high sensitivity and, crucially, reducing the need for face-to-face contact. Increased education is key to overcoming barriers women have to screening and telemedicine can strengthen engagement with women during this time. CONCLUSION: There are lessons to be learned from the pandemic, and we must use this opportunity to improve cervical screening uptake for the future.","Masson, Hannah",Womens Health (Lond),26,16

We aimed to describe the early psychological impact of COVID-19 and its contributing factors in a large Spanish sample, globally and according to mental status (never mental disorder NMD, past mental disorder PMD, current mental disorder CMD). Methods: An online questionnaire was conducted between 19 and 26 March, five days after the official declaration of alarm and the lockdown order. Data included sociodemographic and clinical information and the DASS-21 and IES questionnaires. We analysed 21 207 responses using the appropriate descriptive and univariate tests as well as binary logistic regression to identify psychological risk and protective factors. Results: We found a statistically significant gradient in the psychological impact experienced in five domains according to mental status, with the NMD group being the least affected and the CMD group being the most affected.

However, there is little known about the demand pattern for calcium salts and collagen needed by biomineralization. In this study, natural bone biomineralization is analyzed, and a novel interplay between calcium concentration and collagen production is observed. Any quantitative change in one of the entities causes a corresponding change in the other. Translocation-associated membrane protein 2 (TRAM2) is identified as an intermediate factor whose silencing disrupts this relationship and causes poor mineralization. TRAM2 directly interacts with the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 2b (SERCA2b) and modulates SERCA2b activity to couple calcium enrichment with collagen biosynthesis. Collectively, these findings indicate that osteoblasts can independently and directly regulate the process of biomineralization via this coupling.

The sedentary lifestyle and possible poor nutrition in nursing homes place residents (NHRs) at risk for body composition impairments, malnutrition, and, subsequently, numerous chronic diseases. The aim of this study was to assess body composition (including body fluids) and dietary intake in NHRs. The association between osteosarcopenic adiposity syndrome (OSA) and its components, osteopenic adiposity (OA), sarcopenic adiposity (SA), and adiposity-only (AD), and specific macro- and micro-nutrients was evaluated as well. The study included 84 participants (82.1% women), aged 65.3-95.2 years. Body composition was assessed with an advanced bioelectrical impedance device BIA-ACC® and dietary intake was assessed via 24-h recall and analyzed using ""Nutrition"" software. The majority (95%) of participants were overweight with a high body fat and low muscle and bone mass, leading to a high prevalence of OSA (>50%), OA (13%), and AD (26%). There were only a few participants with SA, and they were not analyzed. The highest extracellular water/total body water ratio was observed in the OSA participants, indicating a heightened inflammatory state. Participants in all three body composition categories had a similar nutrient intake, with protein, fiber, omega-3 fatty acids, and almost all micronutrients being far below recommendations. In conclusion, a high prevalence of OSA among NHRs accompanied by a poor dietary intake, could place these residents at a very high risk for COVID-19 infections. Therefore, optimization of body composition and nutritional status should be included along with standard medical care in order to provide better health maintenance, particularly in the COVID-19 era.","Keser, Irena; Cvijetic, Selma; Ilic, Ana; Colic Baric, Irena; Boschiero, Dario; Ilich, Jasminka Z",Nutrients,26,25

A total of 9 male nurses newly recruited for the COVID-19 wards in Chinese hospitals were interviewed for this study. And Colaizzi's method was applied for evaluation in the data analysis. RESULTS: Based on our findings, three themes were extracted. Firstly, the newly recruited male nurses showed negative emotions at the beginning of COVID-19 epidemic, which was caused by changesin working conditions and content, but also prompted the nurses to change the way of coping with the crisis. Secondly, they gradually mastered the working skills and psychological training tocope with COVID-19, and developed a positive attitude towards life and a high sense of professional responsibility. Finally, we learned about their needs to respond to public health emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is a disaster for all of humanity. The newly recruited male nurses are an important force in emergency rescue. Although they suffered from short-term negative emotions, they quickly adapted to the crisis. In order to better prepare for future emergencies, the disaster response capacity of newly recruited male nurses needs to be further improved.

It was initially linked to the animal-to-human transmission. However, it is now thought that COVID-19 is spreading through human-to-human transmission mainly via droplets. As there is no definite antiviral therapy for the treatment of cases with COVID-19 the best option for slowing down the pandemic and reducing mortality rates is protection against the virus of interest. To achieve this goal obtaining information about how first cases infected with COVID-19 is crucial. Hence, this study aims to review the studies published in peer-reviewed journals to report the first confirmed cases with COVID-19. Herein, we review the origin, symptoms, diagnostic tests, and progress of the disease and possible actions of authorities which would be effective in similar pandemics in the future. This study reviewed 13 cases (5 females and 8 males; 25-61 years old) from 10 countries. All cases have recovered from COVID-19. The results of this review suggested that timely reports of the confirmed cases, notifying World Health Organization and providing information to the general population about the methods of spreading the virus would have decreased the number of infected cases and mortality rates. In addition, the travel history of the first confirmed cases in various countries suggested that prompt actions in restricting travels and closing borders could be an efficient strategy in preventing the transmission of the disease outside of the affected sites.

Our theory development is based on three ongoing academic debates related to (a) the unrepresentativeness of the stakeholder theory in entrepreneurship research; (b) the emergence of digital social entrepreneurship (DSE) as a bridge between stakeholders' needs, socio-economic actors, and digital-social initiatives; and (c) the role of N-Helix collaborations to facilitate the emergence of global knowledge-intensive initiatives and the rapid adoptions of open innovations. Our results support our assumptions about the positive mediation effect of DSE in the relationship between N-Helix collaborations and stakeholders' satisfaction. Notably, results show how pandemic has intensified these relationships and how DSE in N-Helix collaborations can generate social impacts globally.

Since then, the contagion has rapidly spread all over the world resulting in a global pandemic. Since frequent cardiovascular (CV) system involvement has soon been detected in patients occurring coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we would provide a simple review available to cardiologists who are going to be involved in the management of COVID-19 patients from several levels: from diagnosis to prevention and management of CV complications. AREAS COVERED: We investigate the role of CV diseases in COVID-19: from the incidence of CV comorbidities to their negative impact on prognosis. We also search Literature in order to identify the main CV manifestations in patients occurring virus infection and their management by cardiologists. EXPERT OPINION: Specific treatments for CV involvement associated with COVID-19 are still debated. Results from ongoing trials are needed to further clarify issues about the therapeutic approach, which is constantly changing according to the continuous flow of published evidence. Finally, it seems necessary to sensitize all population to raise awareness on CV diseases in the COVID era, to hinder the underestimation of both new-onset acute CV diseases and the consequences of chronic mistreated CV diseases.","Capone, Valentina; Cuomo, Vittoria; Esposito, Roberta; Canonico, Mario Enrico; Ilardi, Federica; Prastaro, Maria; Esposito, Giovanni; Santoro, Ciro",Expert Rev Cardiovasc Ther,26,16

We reviewed the evidence on cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 based on PubMed database. The searching strategy was (COVID* or coronavirus*) and (dermatol* or skin* or cutaneous*). The publication time was limited to 2019 onward. After independent review by two authors, 14 studies with 228 confirmed cases were included in the analysis. A total of 60 patients developed skin rashes, and the age ranged from 8 to 84. Exanthematous eruptions potentially related to COVID-19 infection were highly variable and heterogeneous. Skin lesions mainly appeared erythematous, urticarial, and vesicular (chicken pox-like or varicelliform). Petechiae rash, livedo reticularis, and reactivation of oral HSV-1 were also observed in single cases. Newly reported eruptions like vascular lesions and peculiar (perniosis-like) skin lesions caused concern among dermatologists. Exanthems were widely distributed and were primarily located on the trunk. Associated symptoms, latency time, treatment, and prognosis were also carefully summarized. This study reviewed the recently published COVID-19 studies with skin manifestations, which may pave the way for further research.","Tang, Keyun; Wang, Yuanzhuo; Zhang, Hanlin; Zheng, Qingyue; Fang, Rouyu; Sun, Qiuning",Dermatol Ther,26,6

However, despite the diversity of novel theoretical approaches and the comprehensiveness of many widely established models, the official figures that recount the course of the outbreak still sketch a largely elusive and intimidating picture. Here we show unambiguously that the dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak belongs to the simple universality class of the SIR model and extensions thereof. Our analysis naturally leads us to establish that there exists a fundamental limitation to any theoretical approach, namely the unpredictable non-stationarity of the testing frames behind the reported figures. However, we show how such bias can be quantified self-consistently and employed to mine useful and accurate information from the data. In particular, we describe how the time evolution of the reporting rates controls the occurrence of the apparent epidemic peak, which typically follows the true one in countries that were not vigorous enough in their testing at the onset of the outbreak. The importance of testing early and resolutely appears as a natural corollary of our analysis, as countries that tested massively at the start clearly had their true peak earlier and less deaths overall.","Carletti, Timoteo; Fanelli, Duccio; Piazza, Francesco",Chaos Solitons Fractals X,26,3

Oncolytic viruses are gaining traction as novel cancer therapeutics. These viruses are either naturally nonpathogenic or engineered to be safe by specific genetic deletions yet retain the ability to infect and kill human cancer cells and elicit anticancer immunity. Some versions are being specifically designed and tested in patients with osteosarcoma, though due to their generalized mechanism of action most are being tested in patients across a broad range of cancer types. The activity of these viruses is impacted not only by the susceptibility of tumor cells to infection but also by the tumor microenvironment (TME) and by tumor immunogenicity. Here we review the field of oncolytic viruses with a particular emphasis on highlighting any available data in preclinical osteosarcoma models or in patients with osteosarcoma. While in general the viruses have been shown safe to administer to patients by a variety of routes, their therapeutic efficacy to date has been limited. Given the low rate of adverse events and the likely absence of long-term side effects, the utility of oncolytic viruses will most likely be realized when used in combination with other agents.","Wedekind, Mary Frances; Cripe, Timothy P",Adv Exp Med Biol,26,21

The interfacial stability of aging oily sludge hinders the recovery and disposal of oil resources. This review summarizes the interfacial film stability of aging oily sludge, which occurs through the formation of viscoelastic and rigid bilayer interfacial films between heavy components (asphaltenes and resins) and inorganic particles. The bilayer interfacial films enhance interfacial film strength and hinder the aggregation of droplets, contributing to the formation of a stable and high-viscosity oil-water-solid three-phase mixture. Recent demulsification technologies for reducing the stability of interfacial films have been classified as follows: removing heavy components, changing asphaltene aggregate structure, and reducing inorganic particle content. More efficient demulsification technologies are expected to be developed by deeply analyzing the microstructure and interfacial properties of asphaltenes and resins, as well as comprehensively studying the complex interactions among various components. This review constructs a bridge between the stability mechanism and the corresponding destabilization methods, which would promote future studies in aging oily sludge treatment.","Liu, Jia; Zhang, Yixuan; Peng, Kaiming; Zhao, Xia; Xiong, Yuan; Huang, Xiangfeng",J Hazard Mater,26,21

This paper presents findings related to the ""universe"" of people who called the toll-free service, from the sociocultural characteristics of the users to the information collected by the professionals during the psychological pathways until human satisfaction was achieved. We provide a retrospective description of an experience that took place between April and June 2020, and which involved users of the maternal-infant area calling from the whole Italy. (1) Methods: The aims of this study were to investigate the configuration of the indicators identified and to detect the possible correlations between them in the sample. There were 193 users who took advantage of the Service, 160 of whom continued beyond the reception service; it is this group that we report the findings from here. The tool used was a form reporting access to care and interventions, and the resulting data underwent a content analysis and the indicators were subject to non-parametric statistical analysis to analyze differences and relationships. (2) Results: There were many correlations among the indicators that revealed a high prevalence of calls due to personal motivations and requests for support, which later allowed users to gain a greater understanding of the underlying problems they were facing. The professionals running the service noticed a prevalence of weaknesses attributable to the negative emotions of its users, alongside a presence of cognitive and relational resources. The professionals' interventions, which can be characterized by a prevalence of social support, psychological rehabilitation, and psychoeducation, achieved outcomes of redefining users' relationships with themselves and others. All of the service's users have expressed a high level of satisfaction with it. (3) Discussion: Our results revealed the protective and transformative effects of the service for its users and the underlying importance of having an easily accessible psychological support system in place during emergencies, like the recent pandemic. In conditions like these, the great value of a remote support service should be noted, and despite its limitations, assures its own efficacy when a medical emergency precludes closer in-person forms of psychological assistance.","Perricone, Giovanna; Rotolo, Ilenia; Beninati, Viviana; Billeci, Nicolò; Ilarda, Valeria; Polizzi, Concetta",Pediatr Rep,26,1

Existing treatments that can be repurposed as prophylactic and therapeutic agents may reduce the pandemic's devastation. Emerging evidence of potential applications in other therapeutic contexts has led to the investigation of dietary supplements and nutraceuticals for COVID-19. Such products include vitamin C, vitamin D, omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, probiotics, and zinc, all of which are currently under clinical investigation. In this review, we critically appraise the evidence surrounding dietary supplements and nutraceuticals for the prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19. Overall, further study is required before evidence-based recommendations can be formulated, but nutritional status plays a significant role in patient outcomes, and these products may help alleviate deficiencies. For example, evidence indicates that vitamin D deficiency may be associated with a greater incidence of infection and severity of COVID-19, suggesting that vitamin D supplementation may hold prophylactic or therapeutic value. A growing number of scientific organizations are now considering recommending vitamin D supplementation to those at high risk of COVID-19. Because research in vitamin D and other nutraceuticals and supplements is preliminary, here we evaluate the extent to which these nutraceutical and dietary supplements hold potential in the COVID-19 crisis. IMPORTANCE Sales of dietary supplements and nutraceuticals have increased during the pandemic due to their perceived ""immune-boosting"" effects. However, little is known about the efficacy of these dietary supplements and nutraceuticals against the novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) or the disease that it causes, CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19). This review provides a critical overview of the potential prophylactic and therapeutic value of various dietary supplements and nutraceuticals from the evidence available to date. These include vitamin C, vitamin D, and zinc, which are often perceived by the public as treating respiratory infections or supporting immune health. Consumers need to be aware of misinformation and false promises surrounding some supplements, which may be subject to limited regulation by authorities. However, considerably more research is required to determine whether dietary supplements and nutraceuticals exhibit prophylactic and therapeutic value against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19.

We aimed to evaluate the effects of ARBs/ACE inhibitors on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a retrospective, single-center study. One hundred twenty-six patients with COVID-19 and preexisting hypertension at Hubei Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Wuhan from January 5 to February 22, 2020, were retrospectively allocated to ARBs/ACE inhibitors group (n=43) and non-ARBs/ACE inhibitors group (n=83) according to their antihypertensive medication. One hundred twenty-five age- and sex-matched patients with COVID-19 without hypertension were randomly selected as nonhypertension controls. In addition, the medication history of 1942 patients with hypertension that were admitted to Hubei Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine from November 1 to December 31, 2019, before the COVID-19 outbreak were also reviewed for external comparison. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected, analyzed, and compared between these groups. The frequency of ARBs/ACE inhibitors usage in patients with hypertension with or without COVID-19 were comparable. Among patients with COVID-19 and hypertension, those received either ARBs/ACE inhibitors or non-ARBs/ACE inhibitors had comparable blood pressure. However, ARBs/ACE inhibitors group had significantly lower concentrations of hs-CRP (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein; P=0.049) and PCT (procalcitonin, P=0.008). Furthermore, a lower proportion of critical patients (9.3% versus 22.9%; P=0.061) and a lower death rate (4.7% versus 13.3%; P=0.216) were observed in ARBs/ACE inhibitors group than non-ARBs/ACE inhibitors group, although these differences failed to reach statistical significance. Our findings thus support the use of ARBs/ACE inhibitors in patients with COVID-19 and preexisting hypertension.","Yang, Guang; Tan, Zihu; Zhou, Ling; Yang, Min; Peng, Lang; Liu, Jinjin; Cai, Jingling; Yang, Ru; Han, Junyan; Huang, Yafei; He, Shaobin",Hypertension,26,16

This study explored parent's attitudes toward LFH policy based on a survey of 261 participants from 16 provinces in Indonesia. Employing latent class analysis, we revealed three distinct groups of parents with unique compounds of attitudes toward LFH (i.e., disengaged, positive, and negative). Disengaged parents neither consider LFH useful, nor do they see it as demanding. In contrast, the other two groups of parents have quite the opposite views on the usefulness and demandingness of LFH. Further analysis using multinomial logistic regression revealed that older parents from low-income households tend to be disengaged while fathers of young children tend to have negative attitudes toward LFH. Interestingly, the ownership of a personal computer at home seems to be a key indicator of parents with positive attitudes toward LFH after controlling for other demographic factors. How the findings provide a firsthand insight on the existence of digital divide by highlighting the importance of access to personal computers at home is further discussed.","Pratama, Ahmad R; Firmansyah, Firman M",J Child Fam Stud,26,1

During the last two decades, three outbreaks of coronavirus-associated pneumonia, namely Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome, and the ongoing Coronavirus Infectious Disease-2019 (COVID-19) were reported. The rate of diagnosis of viral pneumonia is increasingly approaching 60% among children identified as having community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Clinical presentation ranges from mild to severe pneumonitis complicated by respiratory failure in severe cases. The most vulnerable patients, the elderly and those living with cancer, report a relevant mortality rate. No clinical characteristics can be useful to conclusively distinguish the different etiology of viral pneumonia. However, accessory symptoms, such as anosmia or ageusia together with respiratory symptoms suggest COVID-19. An etiologic-based treatment of viral pneumonia is possible in a small percentage of cases only. Neuraminidase inhibitors have been proven to reduce the need for ventilatory support and mortality rate while only a few data support the large-scale use of other antivirals. A low-middle dose of dexamethasone and heparin seems to be effective in COVID-19 patients, but data regarding their possible efficacy in viral pneumonia caused by other viruses are conflicting. In conclusion, viral pneumonia is a relevant cause of CAP, whose interest is increasing due to the current COVID-19 outbreak. To set up a therapeutic approach is difficult because of the low number of active molecules and the conflicting data bearing supportive treatments such as steroids.","Pagliano, P; Sellitto, C; Conti, V; Ascione, T; Esposito, Silvano",Infection,26,16

OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to test the effectiveness of portal and interactive voice response outreach in improving rates of influenza vaccination by targeting patients in early September, shortly after vaccinations became available. METHODS: Using electronic health record portal messages and interactive voice response calls promoting influenza vaccination, outreach was conducted in September 2015. Participants included adult patients within a large multispecialty group practice in central Massachusetts. Our main outcome was electronic health record-documented early influenza vaccination during the 2015-2016 influenza season, measured in November 2015. We randomly assigned all active portal users to 1 of 2 groups: (1) receiving a portal message promoting influenza vaccinations, listing upcoming clinics, and offering online scheduling of vaccination appointments (n=19,506) or (2) receiving usual care (n=19,505). We randomly assigned all portal nonusers to 1 of 2 groups: (1) receiving interactive voice response call (n=15,000) or (2) receiving usual care (n=43,596). The intervention also solicited patient self-reports on influenza vaccinations completed outside the clinic. Self-reported influenza vaccination data were uploaded into the electronic health records to increase the accuracy of existing provider-directed electronic health record clinical decision support (vaccination alerts) but were excluded from main analyses. RESULTS: Among portal users, 28.4% (5549/19,506) of those randomized to receive messages and 27.1% (5294/19,505) of the usual care group had influenza vaccinations documented by November 2015 (P=.004). In multivariate analysis of portal users, message recipients were slightly more likely to have documented vaccinations when compared to the usual care group (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.02-1.12). Among portal nonusers, 8.4% (1262/15,000) of those randomized to receive calls and 8.2% (3586/43,596) of usual care had documented vaccinations (P=.47), and multivariate analysis showed nonsignificant differences. Over half of portal messages sent were opened (10,112/19,479; 51.9%), and over half of interactive voice response calls placed (7599/14,984; 50.7%) reached their intended target, thus we attained similar levels of exposure to the messaging for both interventions. Among portal message recipients, 25.4% of message openers (2570/10,112) responded to a subsequent question on receipt of influenza vaccination; among interactive voice response recipients, 72.5% of those reached (5513/7599) responded to a similar question. CONCLUSIONS: Portal message outreach to a general primary care population achieved a small but statistically significant improvement in rates of influenza vaccination (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.02-1.12). Interactive voice response calls did not significantly improve vaccination rates among portal nonusers (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.96-1.10). Rates of patient engagement with both modalities were favorable.

Many were not evaluated rigorously, and there is a significant lack of concordance in results across methods. To enable meaningful clinical decisions to be made, robustly evaluated, quantitative serology methods are needed. These should be harmonized to a primary reference material, allowing for the comparison of trial data and improved clinical decision making. A comprehensive evaluation of the new Abbott IgG II anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG method was undertaken using CLSI-based protocols. Two different candidate primary reference materials and verification panels were assessed with a goal to move toward harmonization. The Abbott IgG II method performed well across a wide range of parameters with excellent imprecision (<3.5%) and was linear throughout the positive range (tested to 38,365 AU/ml). The sensitivity (based on &#8805;14-day post-positive reverse transcription-PCR [RT-PCR] samples) and specificity were 98.3% (90.6% to 100.0%) and 99.5% (97.1% to 100%), respectively. The candidate reference materials showed poor correlation across methods, with mixed responses noted in methods that use the spike protein versus the nucleocapsid proteins as their binding antigen. The Abbott IgG II anti-SARS-CoV-2 measurement appears to be the first linear method potentially capable of monitoring the immune response to natural infection, including from new emerging variants. The candidate reference materials assessed did not generate uniform results across several methods, and further steps are needed to enable the harmonization process.","English, Emma; Cook, Laura E; Piec, Isabelle; Dervisevic, Samir; Fraser, William D; John, W Garry",J Clin Microbiol,26,16

COVID-19 is spread through aerosol making the emergent tracheostomy a high-risk procedure for surgeons. The surgical establishment of the air conduit in emergency scenarios must be adjusted for safety reasons. METHODS: To establish the Slovenian National Guidelines for airway management in cannot intubate-cannot ventilate situations in COVID-19 positive patients. RESULTS: Good communication and coordination between surgeon and anaesthesiologist is absolutely necessary. Deep general anaesthesia, full muscle relaxation and adequate preoxygenation without intubation are initial steps. The surgical cricothyrotomy is performed quickly, the thin orotracheal tube is inserted, the cuff is inflated and ventilation begins. Following patient stabilisation, the conversion to the tracheostomy is undertaken with the following features: skin infiltration with vasoconstrictor, a vertical incision, avoidance of electrical devices in favour of classical manners of haemostasis, the advancement of the tube towards the carina, performing the tracheal window in complete apnoea following adequate oxygenation, the insertion of non-fenestrated canulla attached to a heat and moisture exchanger, the fixation of canulla with stitches and tapes, and the cricothyrotomy entrance closure. Appropriate safety equipment is equally important. CONCLUSION: The goal of the guidelines is to make the procedure safer for medical teams, without harming the patients.

The current COVID-19 pandemic has left the world in a unique state of crisis. The aim of this analysis was to explore whether Google searches can be used to retrospectively retrace the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany and to detect local outbreaks by reflecting public interest in the virus. METHODS: Google Trends was used to explore the relative search volume (RSV) related to ""coronavirus"" from January 2020 to July 2020 in Germany. The RSV ranging between 0-100 was compared to new SARS-CoV-2 infections per day on a national level and to the cumulative infection numbers on a state level, as well as to important infectiological and political events. RESULTS: The most striking search peaks occurred after the first reported SARS-CoV-2 infection in Germany (January 27), during a major local outbreak in Heinsberg (February 25), after school closings (March 13) and the largest peak after nationwide contact restrictions (March 22) were announced. On a state level, peaks in RSV were observed after the first reported infection in each respective state. In addition, a higher RSV was recorded in states with higher numbers of infections (r=0,6, p=0,014) such as in Bavaria (RSV=96, 391 infections/100,000 inhabitants) and Baden-Württemberg (RSV=98, 340 infections/100,000 inhabitants). The lowest RSV (n=83) and lowest number of infections (50 infections/100,000 inhabitants) was observed in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. Since the end of May, SARS-CoV-2 related RSV remained at low level even when numbers of infections were temporarily rising due to local outbreaks such as the outbreak in Gütersloh, North Rhine-Westphalia. CONCLUSION: RSV related to ""coronavirus"" precisely reflected public interest during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. As public interest has strongly declined, information distribution regarding the newest developments over the entire course of the pandemic will be a major public health challenge. ZIEL DER STUDIE: Während Pandemien ist die gesamte Gesellschaft zur gleichen Zeit mit derselben Erkrankung konfrontiert, was zu großem öffentlichen Interesse führt. Die aktuelle COVID-19 Pandemie hat die ganze Welt in einen einmaligen Ausnahmezustand versetzt. Ziel dieser Studie war es zu untersuchen ob das Pandemiegeschehen in Deutschland anhand von Google Suchanfragen retrospektiv rekonstruiert werden kann und ob lokale Ausbrüche mithilfe von Google Daten detektiert werden können. METHODIK: Das relative Google Suchvolumen (RSV) zum Thema ""Coronavirus"" wurde für den Zeitraum von Januar bis Juli 2020 mit Google Trends analysiert. Das RSV, das zwischen 0 und 100 betragen kann, wurde auf Bundesebene mit den täglich neu gemeldeten SARS-CoV-2 Infektionszahlen und auf Länderebene mit den kumulativen Infektionszahlen pro Bundesland sowie wichtigen infektiologischen und politischen Ereignissen verglichen. ERGEBNISSE: Höchstwerte im Google Suchvolumen nach der ersten gemeldeten SARS-CoV-2-Infektion in Deutschland (27. Januar), während des lokalen Ausbruchs in Heinsberg (25. Februar), nach den Schulschließungen (13. März) sowie, der absolute Höchstwert, nach Verkündung der bundesweiten Kontaktbeschränkungen (22. März) verzeichnet worden. Auf Bundesländerebene wurde immer dann ein Anstieg im Suchvolumen beobachtet, wenn die erste SARS-CoV-2 Infektion im jeweiligen Bundesland gemeldet wurde. Zudem wurde ein höheres RSV in Bundesländern mit mehr gemeldeten SARS-CoV-2-Infektionen registriert (r=0,6, p=0,014), wie z. B. in Bayern (RSV=96, 391 Infektionen/100 000 Einwohner) und Baden-Württemberg (RSV=98, 340 Infektionen/100 000 Einwohner). Das niedrigste RSV (n=83) und die niedrigste Anzahl an Infektionen (50 Infektionen/100 000 Einwohner) wurde in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern beobachtet. Seit Ende Mai ist das RSV bezüglich SARS-CoV-2 konstant gering, obwohl die Zahl an Neuinfektionen zwischenzeitlich aufgrund lokaler Ausbrüche gestiegen war wie z. B. der lokale Ausbruch in Gütersloh, Nordrhein-Westfalen. SCHLUßFOLGERUNG: Das RSV zum Thema ""Coronavirus"" bildeten das öffentliche Interesse während der ersten Monate der COVID-19 Pandemie präzise ab. Da das öffentliche Interesse jedoch stark nachgelassen hat, könnte es eine zentrale Herausforderung im weiteren Verlauf der Pandemie darstellen, die Bevölkerung weiterhin über neueste Entwicklungen und Maßnahmen informiert zu halten.","Schuster, Barbara; Tizek, Linda; Schielein, Maximilian C; Ziehfreund, Stefanie; Rothe, Kathrin; Spinner, Christoph D; Biedermann, Tilo; Zink, Alexander",Gesundheitswesen,26,16

The risk for severe RSV infection is highest in infants and older adults. A safe and effective RSV vaccine for older adults represents a serious unmet medical need due to higher morbidity and mortality in this age group. In this randomized, partially double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1 dose-escalation study, we evaluated the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of an investigational messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccine encoding the RSV fusion protein (F) stabilized in the prefusion conformation. The study was conducted in healthy younger adults (ages &#8805;18 and &#8804;49 years) and healthy older adults (ages &#8805;60 and &#8804;79 years). Participants received mRNA-1777 (V171) or placebo as a single intramuscular dose. For each dose level, three sentinel participants were administered open-label mRNA-1777 (V171). Seventy-two younger adults were randomized and administered 25, 100, or 200 µg mRNA-1777 (V171) or placebo, and 107 older adults were randomized and administered 25, 100, 200 or 300 µg mRNA-1777 (V171) or placebo. Primary objectives were safety and tolerability and secondary objectives included humoral and cell-mediated immunogenicity. All dose levels of mRNA-1777 (V171) were generally well tolerated and no serious adverse events related to the vaccine were reported. Immunization with mRNA-1777 (V171) elicited a humoral immune response as measured by increases in RSV neutralizing antibody titers, serum antibody titers to RSV prefusion F protein, D25 competing antibody titers to RSV prefusion F protein, and cell-mediated immune responses to RSV-F peptides.","Aliprantis, Antonios O; Shaw, Christine A; Griffin, Paul; Farinola, Nicholas; Railkar, Radha A; Cao, Xin; Liu, Wen; Sachs, Jeffrey R; Swenson, Christine J; Lee, Heather; Cox, Kara S; Spellman, Daniel S; Winstead, Colleen J; Smolenov, Igor; Lai, Eseng; Zaks, Tal; Espeseth, Amy S; Panther, Lori",Hum Vaccin Immunother,26,16

However, meteorology causes concentration variations in addition to emission rate changes. Conventional positive matrix factorization (PMF) loses information from the data because of these dilution variations. By incorporating the ventilation coefficient, dispersion normalized PMF (DN-PMF) reduces the dilution effects. DN-PMF was applied to hourly speciated particulate composition data from a field campaign that included the start of the COVID-19 outbreak. DN-PMF sharpened the morning coal combustion and rush hour traffic peaks and lowered the daytime soil, aged sea salt, and waste incinerator contributions that better reflect the actual emissions. These results identified significant changes in source contributions after the COVID-19 outbreak in China. During this pandemic, secondary inorganic aerosol became the predominant PM2.5 source representing 50.5% of the mean mass. Fireworks and residential burning (32.0%), primary coal combustion emissions (13.3%), primary traffic emissions (2.1%), soil and aged sea salt (1.2%), and incinerator (0.9%) represent the other contributors. Traffic decreased dramatically (70%) compared to other sources. Soil and aged sea salt also decreased by 68%, likely from decreased traffic.","Dai, Qili; Liu, Baoshuang; Bi, Xiaohui; Wu, Jianhui; Liang, Danni; Zhang, Yufen; Feng, Yinchang; Hopke, Philip K",Environ Sci Technol,26,33

STUDY DESIGN: Anonymous online questionnaire survey. SAMPLE POPULATION: Eighty-one eligible responses were collected in September 2020, including 52 European College of Veterinary Surgeons (ECVS) residents and 29 ECVS Diplomates acting as supervisors. METHODS: Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data. Fisher's exact test was used to test for significance. RESULTS: A reduction in surgical case load was reported by 82% (n = 66/81) of respondents, with 82% (n = 54/66) of those believing that COVID-19 had a mild-to-moderate impact on training. Compared to supervisors, residents were less likely to feel that appropriate guidance, a safe working environment, and measures to preserve training had been provided (p < .01). Only 45% (n = 22/49) of residents reported confidence with performing teleconsultations. Ninety percent (n = 73/81) of respondents considered online ""case presentations"" and ""edited surgical video footage"" as a positive ancillary tool. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has resulted in a reduction in case load and training for the majority of residents.

As there is an increase of infections in the male population, concerns have emerged about the potential impact of COVID-19 on male reproductive organs and male fertility. Therefore, this study systematically investigates the current evidence of SARS-CoV-2 impact on male reproduction and pregnancy outcomes, discussing them in light of the evidence published on other coronaviruses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Literature search was carried out according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A total of 24 original articles were included for the analysis, investigating the effects of the infection on semen parameters, male reproductive hormones, and pregnancy outcomes. Further, a Strengths-Weaknesses-Opportunities-Threats (SWOT) analysis was conducted based on the available evidence linking the virus with male reproduction and conception. RESULTS: Although there is limited data, viral mRNA has been identified in semen of infected men, with some evidence of altered seminal parameters. Low testosterone and dihydrotestosterone with raised luteinizing hormone has been reported as well as preterm delivery in pregnant women; however, data regarding vertical transmission remains contradictory and inconclusive. CONCLUSIONS: The recent literature provides evidence that male gonads may be potentially vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection, recommending caution to pregnant women and couples planning natural pregnancy or assisted reproduction.","Khalili, Mohammad Ali; Leisegang, Kristian; Majzoub, Ahmad; Finelli, Renata; Panner Selvam, Manesh Kumar; Henkel, Ralf; Mojgan, Moshrefi; Agarwal, Ashok",,26,1

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study starting on March 29 to April 5, 2020 based on a national online survey using snowball sampling techniques. Symptoms of anxiety (Hamilton Anxiety Scale), depression (Beck Depression Inventory) and acute stress (Acute Stress Disorder Inventory) were compared between people over and under 60 years old. Gender differences and the relationship of loneliness, regular exercise, economic losses and use of anxiolytics on the mental state were evaluated. RESULTS: One thousand six hundred thirty-nine (150 [9.2%] aged &#8805;60) participants completed the survey. The greater than or equal to 60 group showed lower mean (SD) BDI levels than the less than 60 group (3.02 [3.28] versus 4.30 [4.93]); and lower mean (SD) acute stress disorder inventory scores than the less than 60 group (3.68 [3.20] versus 4.45 [3.06]). There were no gender differences in any of the clinical measures. The presence of economic losses as well as the increase in the use of anxiolytics was significantly associated with higher emotional distress in the elderly compared to the younger group. CONCLUSIONS: Older people have shown less emotional distress, with no differences between men and women. Economic loss and substance use should be monitored to guarantee the emotional well-being of the elderly.","García-Fernández, Lorena; Romero-Ferreiro, Verónica; López-Roldán, Pedro David; Padilla, Sergio; Rodriguez-Jimenez, Roberto",Am J Geriatr Psychiatry,26,26

An online survey was sent to the Egyptian university students via all means of online communication during the first week of May 2020 by using a non-probability snowball sampling. A survey included a short version Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) and socio-demographic data. Overall, 70.5, 53.6 and 47.8% of Egyptian students had depression, anxiety and stress, respectively. Being a female, having a relative or acquaintance infected with COVID-19, having a preexisting chronic disease and lacking of psychological support from families, community and universities increase the risk of depression, anxiety and stress among Egyptian students. Being a medical student is associated with depression while, spending more time to follow news of COVID-19 pandemic is associated with increased anxiety. Egyptian students experience varying levels of psychological disturbance during COVID-19 pandemic. This study suggests that mental health of the university students should be carefully, monitored during the crisis and the universities should provide psychological-oriented services, adapted to these circumstances to mitigate its emotional impact on the students.","Ghazawy, Eman R; Ewis, Ashraf A; Mahfouz, Eman M; Khalil, Doaa M; Arafa, Ahmed; Mohammed, Zeinab; Mohammed, El-Nabgha F; Hassan, Ebtesam E; Abdel Hamid, Sarah; Ewis, Somaya A; Mohammed, Abd El-Nassir S",Health promot. internation,26,32

No specific antiviral drugs are available for the treatment of COVID-19 till date. Drug repurposing strategy helps to find out the drugs for COVID-19 treatment from existing FDA approved antiviral drugs. In this study, FDA approved small molecule antiviral drugs were repurposed against the major viral proteins of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: The 3D structures of FDA approved small molecule antiviral drugs were retrieved from PubChem. Virtual screening was performed to find out the lead antiviral drug molecules against main protease (Mpro) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) using COVID-19 Docking Server. Furthermore, lead molecules were individually docked against protein targets using AutoDock 4.0.1 software and their drug-likeness and ADMET properties were evaluated. RESULTS: Out of 65 FDA approved small molecule antiviral drugs screened, Raltegravir showed highest interaction energy value of -9 kcal/mol against Mpro of SARS-CoV-2 and Indinavir, Tipranavir, and Pibrentasvir exhibited a binding energy value of &#8805;-8 kcal/mol. Similarly Indinavir showed the highest binding energy of -11.5 kcal/mol against the target protein RdRp and Dolutegravir, Elbasvir, Tipranavir, Taltegravir, Grazoprevir, Daclatasvir, Glecaprevir, Ledipasvir, Pibrentasvir and Velpatasvir showed a binding energy value in range from -8 to -11.2 kcal/mol. The antiviral drugs Raltegravir, Indinavir, Tipranavir, Dolutegravir, and Etravirine also exhibited good bioavailability and drug-likeness properties. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the screened small molecule antiviral drugs Raltegravir, Indinavir, Tipranavir, Dolutegravir, and Etravirine could serve as potential drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 with further validation studies.","Indu, Purushothaman; Rameshkumar, Marimuthu Ragavan; Arunagirinathan, Narasingam; Al-Dhabi, Naif Abdullah; Valan Arasu, Mariadhas; Ignacimuthu, Savarimuthu",J Infect Public Health,26,33

Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), which involves an aerosol-generating procedure from manual ventilation with a bag mask valve while under anesthesia, has undergone drastic practice changes in order to minimize disruption of treatment in the midst of COVID-19. In this paper, we provide a consensus statement on the clinical practice changes in ECT specific to older adults based on expert group discussions of ECT practitioners across the country and a systematic review of the literature. There is a universal consensus that ECT is an essential treatment of severe mental illness. In addition, there is a clear consensus on what modifications are imperative to ensure continued delivery of ECT in a manner that is safe for patients and staff, while maintaining the viability of ECT services. Approaches to modifications in ECT to address infection control, altered ECT procedures, and adjusting ECT operations are almost uniform across the globe. With modified ECT procedures, it is possible to continue to meet the needs of older patients while mitigating risk of transmission to this vulnerable population.

The extent of the global pandemic due to COVID-19 has a significant impact on our lives that must be studied carefully to combat it. This study highlights the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown on crucial aspects of daily life globally, including; Food security, Global economy, Education, Tourism, hospitality, sports and leisure, Gender Relation, Domestic Violence/Abuse, Mental Health and Environmental air pollution through a systematic search of the literature. The COVID-19 global lockdown was initiated to stem the spread of the virus and 'flatten the curve' of the pandemic. However, the impact of the lockdown has had far-reaching effects in different strata of life, including; changes in the accessibility and structure of education delivery to students, food insecurity as a result of unavailability and fluctuation in prices, the depression of the global economy, increase in mental health challenges, wellbeing and quality of life amongst others. This review article highlights the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown across the globe. As the global lockdown is being lifted in a phased manner in various countries of the world, it is necessary to explore its impacts to understand its consequences comprehensively. This will guide future decisions that will be made in a possible future wave of the COVID-19 pandemic or other global disease outbreak.","Onyeaka, Helen; Anumudu, Christian K; Al-Sharify, Zainab T; Egele-Godswill, Esther; Mbaegbu, Paul",Sci Prog,26,29

Milk and soy are the main sources of protein for children and young animals after weaning. The objective of this study was to compare the effects of dairy and soy proteins on the intestinal barrier in early development. Weanling C57BL/6 mice were fed AIN-93G diets prepared with casein or soy protein isolate (SPI) for 21 days. Compared with those fed with the casein diet, mice fed with the SPI diet did not change their body weight and organ coefficients, but increased their feed intake and ratio of feed to gain. SPI lowered the level of luminal secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) and downregulated the levels of IL-4, IL-13, polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (Pigr), Janus kinase 1 (Jak1), signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (Stat6), and transforming growth factor-ß (Tgfb) in the mouse ileum. Western blotting of ileal proteins confirmed that SPI suppressed the activation of the JAK1/STAT6 signaling pathway. Furthermore, SPI attenuated intestinal mucin production, as demonstrated by the decreased numbers of intestinal goblet cells and the reduced relative expression levels of mucin 1 (Muc1), mucin 2 (Muc2), trefoil factor 3 (Tff3), glucose-regulated protein 94 (Grp94), and anterior gradient homolog 2 (Agr2). The results indicated that the SPI diet could attenuate mouse intestinal immunity, as demonstrated by decreased SIgA and mucin production in the intestine. Therefore, we suggest that our findings should be of consideration when SPI or casein are used as dietary protein sources.","Zeng, Bin; Wang, Dongyang; Wang, Hailong; Chen, Ting; Luo, Junyi; Xi, Qianyun; Sun, Jiajie; Zhang, Yongliang",Nutrients,26,2

METHODS: Nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swabs were collected from travellers to Madagascar, suspected SARS-CoV-2 cases and contact of confirmed cases. Swabs were tested at the national reference laboratory using real-time RT-PCR. Data collected from patients were entered in an electronic database for subsequent statistical analysis. All distribution of laboratory-confirmed cases were mapped, and six genomes of viruses were fully sequenced. RESULTS: Overall, 26,415 individuals were tested for SARS-CoV-2 between 18 March and 18 September 2020, of whom 21.0% (5,553/26,145) returned positive. Among laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, the median age was 39 years (IQR: 28-52), and 56.6% (3,311/5,553) were asymptomatic at the time of sampling. The probability of testing positive increased with age with the highest adjusted odds ratio of 2.2 [95% CI: 1.9-2.5] for individuals aged 49 years and more. Viral strains sequenced belong to clades 19A, 20A and 20B indicative of several independent introduction of viruses. CONCLUSIONS: Our study describes the first wave of the COVID-19 in Madagascar. Despite early strategies in place Madagascar could not avoid the introduction and spread of the virus. More studies are needed to estimate the true burden of disease and make public health recommendations for a better preparation to another wave.","Randremanana, Rindra Vatosoa; Andriamandimby, Soa-Fy; Rakotondramanga, Jean Marius; Razanajatovo, Norosoa Harline; Mangahasimbola, Reziky Tiandraza; Randriambolamanantsoa, Tsiry Hasina; Ranaivoson, Hafaliana Christian; Rabemananjara, Harinirina Aina; Razanajatovo, Iony; Razafindratsimandresy, Richter; Rabarison, Joelinotahiana Hasina; Brook, Cara E; Rakotomanana, Fanjasoa; Rabetombosoa, Roger Mario; Razafimanjato, Helisoa; Ahyong, Vida; Raharinosy, Vololoniaina; Raharimanga, Vaomalala; Raharinantoanina, Sandratana Jonhson; Randrianarisoa, Mirella Malala; Bernardson, Barivola; Randrianasolo, Laurence; Randriamampionona, Léa Bricette Nirina; Tato, Cristina M; DeRisi, Joseph L; Dussart, Philippe; Vololoniaina, Manuela Christophère; Randriatsarafara, Fidiniaina Mamy; Randriamanantany, Zely Arivelo; Heraud, Jean-Michel",Influenza other respir. viruses,26,29

Italian deceased patients have a mean age of 78.5 years and only 1.2% have no comorbidities. These data started a public debate whether patients die ""with"" or ""from"" Covid-19. If on one hand the public opinion has been persuaded to believe that Covid-19 infection has poor outcomes just in elderly and/or fragile subjects, on the other hand, hospitals are admitting an increasing number of healthy young patients needing semi-intensive or intensive care units. PATIENT CONCERNS: At the end of March 2020, a 79-year-old patient (M.G.) was admitted to the emergency department of our hospital with a 5 days history of fever, dyspnea, and cough. He was known for hypertension and coronary artery disease with a previous coronary artery stenting. Both the comorbidities were carried out without complications and the patient was previously asymptomatic and in good health. At admission, he was febrile and showed signs of respiratory failure with hypoxia and hypocapnia at blood gas analysis. DIAGNOSIS: The day after, he was tested for SARS-CoV-2 with a real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay of nasopharyngeal swab, which turned positive and a chest CT-Scan was consistent with the diagnosis of interstitial pneumonia. INTERVENTIONS: He was treated with i.v. diuretics, paracetamol, prolonged noninvasive ventilation (CPAP), and empiric antibiotic therapy on top of his chronic treatment. OUTCOMES: A treatment with heparin and corticosteroids was started; however, he developed irreversible respiratory failure. Invasive ventilation was not considered appropriate due to his comorbidities, low chances of recovery, and intensive care unit overcrowding. The patient died 9 days after admission. LESSONS: Health conditions that are most reported as risk factors are common cardiovascular diseases that can be managed in modern clinical practice. Through a brief illustrative clinical case, we would like to underline how Covid-19 can be per se the cause of death in patients that would otherwise have had an acceptable life expectancy.","Mapelli, Massimo; Mantegazza, Valentina; Agostoni, Piergiuseppe",Medicine (Baltimore),26,20

Similar to the Tapestry scheme of Ghosh et al., the proposed schemes leverage soft information from the RT-qPCR process about the total viral load in the pool. This is in contrast to conventional group testing schemes where the measurements are Boolean. The proposed schemes provide higher testing throughput than the popularly used Dorfman's scheme. They also provide higher testing throughput, sensitivity and specificity than the state-of-the-art non-adaptive Tapestry scheme. The number of pipetting operations is lower than state-of-the-art non-adaptive pooling schemes, and is higher than that for the Dorfman's scheme. The proposed schemes can work with substantially smaller group sizes than non-adaptive schemes and are simple to describe. Monte-Carlo simulations using the statistical model in the work of Ghosh et al. (Tapestry) show that 10 infected people in a population of size 961 can be identified with 70.86 tests on the average with a sensitivity of 99.50% and specificity of 99.62.

An integrative bioinformatics approach starting with mining the biomedical literature for high confidence DPP4-protein/gene associations followed by functional analysis using network analysis and pathway enrichment was adopted. The results indicate that the identified DPP4 networks are highly enriched in viral processes required for viral entry and infection, and as a result, we propose DPP4 as an important putative target for the treatment of COVID-19. Additionally, our protein-chemical interaction networks identified important interactions between DPP4 and sitagliptin. We conclude that sitagliptin may be beneficial for the treatment of COVID-19 disease, either as monotherapy or in combination with other therapies, especially for diabetic patients and patients with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions who are already at higher risk of COVID-19 mortality.","Bardaweel, Sanaa K; Hajjo, Rima; Sabbah, Dima A",Acta Pharm,26,1

The most common cause of TCVO is central venous catheters (CVCs) which can induce intravascular scarring or endoluminal obstruction via thrombus formation. AREAS COVERED: The Surfacer® System is used to obtain central venous access (CVA) in patients with TCVO by facilitating catheter insertion via the novel Inside-Out® approach. This review summarizes the results of clinical studies to date with the Surfacer System, focusing on how the procedure is performed, clinical efficacy and safety of the device and patient populations where the device offers substantial clinical benefit. EXPERT OPINION: The Surfacer System offers a safe and effective approach to reliably preserve and restore critical upper body vascular access sites. For dialysis patients, the device offers an alternative which avoids placement of dialysis catheters in veins which may impact the ability to achieve maturation of hemodialysis vascular access or in locations which have an increased risk of insertion-related complications or are associated with higher morbidity.","Razavi, Mahmood K",Expert Rev Med Devices,26,24

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak has created intense anxiety in nurses/midwives that may affect the care they provide. Nurses and midwives may manage anxiety using solution-focused thinking skills. METHODS: This descriptive correlational study included 170 nurses/midwives at 61 family health centres evaluated from 1 August to 14 September 2020. RESULTS: The participants' state and trait anxiety scores were above average, indicating a moderate level of anxiety and the mean total solution-focused inventory scores were at a moderate level. It was determined that 47.9% of the variance in state anxiety scores could be explained by trait anxiety, age, years of professional experience, chronic illness, type of work shift during the pandemic, follow-up of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 using computed tomography or a COVID-19 test, and whether the institution was taking necessary measures against COVID-19. There was a negative relationship between state anxiety and solution-focused inventory total score. CONCLUSION: Nurses/midwives displayed a moderate level of anxiety and solution-focused thinking skills during the COVID-19 pandemic. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Steps should be taken to improve nurses' solution-focused thinking skills to enable them to organise quickly and manage care processes successfully in extraordinary circumstances such as pandemics. Moreover, personal empowerment programmes should be recommended for nurses and midwives to help them cope with anxiety.","Selçuk Tosun, Alime; Akgül Gündogdu, Nurcan; Tas, Filiz",J. nurs. manag,26,1

The absence of these fixed physical elements when transferring cases to virtual and other non-conventional settings points to a new set of technical challenges.

In this situation, decision-making becomes a controversial process. This article provides insights for public agents in the Brazilian municipalities to deal with the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. We analyzed the actions taken by city halls of the 52 Brazilian municipalities at least thirty days since the first confirmed case of COVID-19. We used a fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) to identify the combinations of contextual factors and public actions that reduced COVID-19 transmission during the critical initial stage. The empirical results show three main paths to guide policy-making: (1) a plural collaboration path involving public and private sectors, operating in a fragile health system; (2) a public action path providing aid programs through intense collaboration inside public bureaucracy; and (3) a resource-based path relying on a well-structured health system.","Ito, Nobuiuki Costa; Pongeluppe, Leandro Simões",Rev. adm. pública (Online),26,20

However, the mortality of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with COVID-19 is unclear. Here, we perform a systematic review and meta-analysis, in line with PRISMA guidelines, to assess the reported ICU mortality for patients with confirmed COVID-19. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed and Cochrane databases up to 31 May 2020 for studies reporting ICU mortality for adult patients admitted with COVID-19. The primary outcome measure was death in intensive care as a proportion of completed ICU admissions, either through discharge from the ICU or death. The definition thus did not include patients still alive on ICU. Twenty-four observational studies including 10,150 patients were identified from centres across Asia, Europe and North America. In-ICU mortality in reported studies ranged from 0 to 84.6%. Seven studies reported outcome data for all patients. In the remaining studies, the proportion of patients discharged from ICU at the point of reporting varied from 24.5 to 97.2%. In patients with completed ICU admissions with COVID-19 infection, combined ICU mortality (95%CI) was 41.6% (34.0-49.7%), I2 = 93.2%). Sub-group analysis by continent showed that mortality is broadly consistent across the globe. As the pandemic has progressed, the reported mortality rates have fallen from above 50% to close to 40%. The in-ICU mortality from COVID-19 is higher than usually seen in ICU admissions with other viral pneumonias. Importantly, the mortality from completed episodes of ICU differs considerably from the crude mortality rates in some early reports.","Armstrong, R A; Kane, A D; Cook, T M",Anaesthesia,26,1

Besides its high infectivity, SARS-CoV-2 causes multiple serious derangements, where the most prominent is severe acute respiratory syndrome as well as multiple organ dysfunction including heart and kidney injury. While the deleterious impact of SARS-CoV-2 on pulmonary and cardiac systems have attracted remarkable attention, the adverse effects of this virus on the renal system is still underestimated. Kidney susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection is determined by the presence of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor which is used as port of the viral entry into targeted cells, tissue tropism, pathogenicity and subsequent viral replication. The SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry receptor, ACE2, is widely expressed in proximal epithelial cells, vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells and podocytes, where it supports kidney integrity and function via the enzymatic production of Angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7), which exerts vasodilatory, anti-inflammatory, antifibrotic and diuretic/natriuretic actions via activation of the Mas receptor axis. Loss of this activity constitutes the potential basis for the renal damage that occurs in COVID-19 patients. Indeed, several studies in a small sample of COVID-19 patients revealed relatively high incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) among them. Although SARS-CoV-1 -induced AKI was attributed to multiorgan failure and cytokine release syndrome, as the virus was not detectable in the renal tissue of infected patients, SARS-CoV-2 antigens were detected in kidney tubules, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infects the human kidney directly, and eventually induces AKI characterized with high morbidity and mortality. The mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are largely unknown. However, the fact that ACE2 plays a crucial role against renal injury, the deprivation of the kidney of this advantageous enzyme, along with local viral replication, probably plays a central role. The current review focuses on the critical role of ACE2 in renal physiology, its involvement in the development of kidney injury during SARS-CoV-2 infection, renal manifestations and therapeutic options. The latter includes exogenous administration of Ang (1-7) as an appealing option, given the high incidence of AKI in this ACE2-depleted disorder, and the benefits of ACE2/Ang1-7 including vasodilation, diuresis, natriuresis, attenuation of inflammation, oxidative stress, cell proliferation, apoptosis and coagulation.","Armaly, Zaher; Kinaneh, Safa; Skorecki, Karl",,26,1

Our goal is to explore how SARS-CoV-2 could interfere with various host cell functions, and to identify drug targets amongst the host genes that could potentially be modulated against COVID-19 by repurposing existing drugs. The machine learning model employed here involves gene embeddings that leverage causal gene expression signatures curated from literature. In contrast to other network-based approaches for drug repurposing, our approach explicitly takes the direction of effects into account, distinguishing between activation and inhibition. RESULTS: We have constructed 70 networks connecting SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins to various biological functions, diseases, and pathways reflecting viral biology, clinical observations, and co-morbidities in the context of COVID-19. Results are presented in the form of interactive network visualizations through a web interface, the Coronavirus Network Explorer (CNE), that allows exploration of underlying experimental evidence. We find that existing drugs targeting genes in those networks are strongly enriched in the set of drugs that are already in clinical trials against COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The approach presented here can identify biologically plausible hypotheses for COVID-19 pathogenesis, explicitly connected to the immunological, virological and pathological observations seen in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. The discovery of repurposable drugs is driven by prior knowledge of relevant functional endpoints that reflect known viral biology or clinical observations, therefore suggesting potential mechanisms of action. We believe that the CNE offers relevant insights that go beyond more conventional network approaches, and can be a valuable tool for drug repurposing.

At Boston Medical Center, a regional safety-net hospital, the Department of Surgery created a dedicated coronavirus disease 2019 Procedure Team to ease the burden on other providers coping with the surge of infected patients. As restrictions on social distancing are lifted, health systems are bracing for additional surges in coronavirus disease 2019 cases. Our objective is to quantify the volume and types of procedures performed, review outcomes, and highlight lessons for other institutions that may need to establish similar teams. METHODS: Procedures were tracked prospectively along with patient demographics, immediate complications, and time from donning to doffing of the personal protective equipment. Retrospective chart review was conducted to obtain patient outcomes and delayed adverse events. We hypothesized that a dedicated surgeon-led team would perform invasive bedside procedures expeditiously and with few complications. RESULTS: From March 30, 2020 to April 30, 2020, there were 1,196 coronavirus disease 2019 admissions. The Procedure Team performed 272 procedures on 125 patients, including placement of 135 arterial catheters, 107 central venous catheters, 25 hemodialysis catheters, and 4 thoracostomy tubes.

At Boston Medical Center, a regional safety-net hospital, the Department of Surgery created a dedicated coronavirus disease 2019 Procedure Team to ease the burden on other providers coping with the surge of infected patients. As restrictions on social distancing are lifted, health systems are bracing for additional surges in coronavirus disease 2019 cases. Our objective is to quantify the volume and types of procedures performed, review outcomes, and highlight lessons for other institutions that may need to establish similar teams. METHODS: Procedures were tracked prospectively along with patient demographics, immediate complications, and time from donning to doffing of the personal protective equipment. Retrospective chart review was conducted to obtain patient outcomes and delayed adverse events. We hypothesized that a dedicated surgeon-led team would perform invasive bedside procedures expeditiously and with few complications. RESULTS: From March 30, 2020 to April 30, 2020, there were 1,196 coronavirus disease 2019 admissions. The Procedure Team performed 272 procedures on 125 patients, including placement of 135 arterial catheters, 107 central venous catheters, 25 hemodialysis catheters, and 4 thoracostomy tubes. Specific to central venous access, the average procedural time was 47 minutes, and the rate of immediate complications was 1.5%, including 1 arterial cannulation and 1 pneumothorax. CONCLUSION: Procedural complication rate was less than rates reported in the literature. The team saved approximately 192 hours of work that could be redirected to other patient care needs.

This paper investigates the experiences of a sudden change of policy in the form of an age restriction that trumped the contemporary active aging ideal. A web-based qualitative survey was conducted in April 2020. Through manual coding of a total of 851 responses, six different ways of relating to the age-based recommendations were identified. The results show that age is not an unproblematic governing principle. Instead, in addition to protecting a vulnerable group, the age-based recommendation meant deprivation of previously assigned individual responsibility and, consequently, autonomy. It is shown how respondents handled this tension through varying degrees of compliance and resistance. Findings highlight the importance of continuously tracking the long-term consequences of age-based policy to avoid negative self-image and poorer health among older adults.","Nilsson, Gabriella; Ekstam, Lisa; Axmon, Anna; Andersson, Janicke",J Aging Soc Policy,26,26

This study aimed to examine the impact of health- and social-inequality-related factors on well-being in order to further distinguish each of their effects during the pandemic. Methods: A nationally-representative sample of 5077 UK respondents aged 18 years or older was recruited through an online survey panel during the COVID-19 pandemic. Their subjective well-being was measured using the 11-point Cantril Ladder of Life Scale. The impact of inequality-related health and social factors (pre-existing medical conditions, household size and occupation), as well as COVID-19-related risk factors (symptoms, confirmed infections, and social distancing behaviours) on well-being were analysed using multiple linear regression models. The associations between the COVID-19-related risk factors and well-being according to the respondents' household size and occupation were modelled in order to test the differences by their socioeconomic profile. Results: We identified inverted V-shaped associations between household size and subjective well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared to single-person households, respondents from households of two to four persons showed better well-being (ß = 0.57; CI (0.44, 0.72)), whereas living in crowded households of five persons or more was associated with decreased well-being (ß = -0.48; CI (-0.71, -0.25)). Furthermore, lower-skilled occupations (elementary occupations: ß = -0.31; CI (-0.58, -0.03); logistics and transport services: ß = -0.37; CI (-0.74, -0.01)) and chronic medical conditions (cardiometabolic or respiratory diseases: ß = -0.25; CI (-0.41, -0.1); and mental health conditions: ß = -1.12; CI (-1.28, -0.96)) were factors associated with reduced well-being during the pandemic. Interactions between a positive COVID-19 diagnosis, symptoms, and crowded households were identified (ß = -0.95; CI (-1.76, -0.14) and ß = -4.74; CI (-9.87, -1.61), respectively). Conclusions: In a national sample, the levels of general subjective well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns were disproportionately distributed across different groups within society.

Current testing approaches for this RNA virus focus primarily on diagnosis by RT-qPCR, which is time-consuming, costly, often inaccurate, and impractical for general population rollout due to the need for laboratory processing. The latency until the test result arrives with the patient has led to further virus spread. Furthermore, latest antigen rapid tests still require 15-30 min processing time and are challenging to handle. Despite increased polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-test and antigen-test efforts, the pandemic continues to evolve worldwide. Herein, we developed a superfast, reagent-free, and nondestructive approach of attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy with subsequent chemometric analysis toward the prescreening of virus-infected samples. Contrived saliva samples spiked with inactivated Î³-irradiated COVID-19 virus particles at levels down to 1582 copies/mL generated infrared (IR) spectra with a good signal-to-noise ratio. Predominant virus spectral peaks are tentatively associated with nucleic acid bands, including RNA. At low copy numbers, the presence of a virus particle was found to be capable of modifying the IR spectral signature of saliva, again with discriminating wavenumbers primarily associated with RNA. Discrimination was also achievable following ATR-FTIR spectral analysis of swabs immersed in saliva variously spiked with virus. Next, we nested our test system in a clinical setting wherein participants were recruited to provide demographic details, symptoms, parallel RT-qPCR testing, and the acquisition of pharyngeal swabs for ATR-FTIR spectral analysis. Initial categorization of swab samples into negative versus positive COVID-19 infection was based on symptoms and PCR results (n = 111 negatives and 70 positives). Following training and validation (using n = 61 negatives and 20 positives) of a genetic algorithm-linear discriminant analysis (GA-LDA) algorithm, a blind sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 89% was achieved.

These particles-with more serious health effects than PM less than 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5)-are difficult to measure using the current methods because their characteristics are different from those of other air pollutants. Therefore, a new monitoring system is required to obtain accurate UFPs information, which will raise the financial burden of the government and people. In this study, we estimated the economic value of UFPs information by evaluating the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for the UFPs monitoring and reporting system. We used the contingent valuation method (CVM) and the one-and-one-half-bounded dichotomous choice (OOHBDC) spike model. We analyzed how the respondents' socio-economic variables, as well as their cognition level of PM, affected their WTP. Therefore, we collected WTP data of 1,040 Korean respondents through an online survey. The estimated mean WTP for building a UFPs monitoring and reporting system is KRW 6,958.55-7,222.55 (USD 6.22-6.45) per household per year. We found that people satisfied with the current air pollutant information, and generally possessing relatively greater knowledge of UFPs, have higher WTP for a UFPs monitoring and reporting system.

Potentially harmful substances are liberated when tissues are vaporized with laser. This creates numerous risks, including the spread of infectious disease. Smoke evacuators are devices that capture and filter laser plume, thereby maintaining a safe environment for the surgical team and patient. Our aim was to characterize the microbial community structure within the suction tube and funnel of the smoke evacuator system, identify their origin, and evaluate pathogenicity. Dust particles were collected from the instruments with a cotton swab. DNA was extracted from the swabs and the transport media, and sequencing was performed using the Illumina HiSeq Xplatform. Metagenomic analysis was conducted using the Empowering the Development of Genomics Expertise (EDGE) Bioinformatics pipeline and custom Python scripts. The most abundant bacterial species were Micrococcus luteus and Brevibacterium casei in the suction tube, and Dermacoccus sp. Ellin 185 and Janibacter hoylei in the suction funnel. A total of 15 medium- to high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) were constructed where we found 104 antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs) and 741 virulence factors. Findings indicate that the suction tube and funnel are likely a reservoir of virulence factor genes and ARGs, which can possibly be passed on to other bacteria via horizontal gene transfer.

We established the course for expanding infectious disease care capacity by a dedicated hands-on lecture for health professionals who are unfamiliar with infectious disease care in ordinary circumstances. Our lecture included the typical course of COVID-19, use of personal protective equipment, environmental sterilization, medical-ward zoning, and safe caregiving. Hospitals that received customized lectures reported by means of a questionnaire that the lectures were well suited to their needs. Currently, the health-care system in Tokyo has increased its capacity to meet the demand and has not been affected by COVID-19. Our experience shows that health emergency and disaster experts can assist hospitals in crisis by providing educational materials.","Kato, Soichiro; Miyakuni, Yasuhiko; Inoue, Yoshitaka; Yamaguchi, Yoshihiro",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,26,16

METHODS: We merged by county CDC's SVI and the New York Times data on coronavirus cases. We estimated the association between the SVI and risk of death from COVID-19 per 100,000 people in counties with confirmed cases (n=2,755 U.S. counties) using multivariable Poisson regression. RESULTS: The adjusted risk of COVID-19-related death followed a non-linear pattern, with the lowest risk among SVIs from 0.05 to 0.55 (roughly 3.1 to 3.5/100,000 people) and highest risk corresponding to SVI=0.95 (6.5/100,000). Compared with a SVI=0.35, SVIs of 0.85 and 0.95 were associated with 2.3 (2.1, 2.5) and 3.4 (3.1, 3.7) excess deaths per 100,000, respectively.

This paper introduces SimGAN, a framework to tackle domain adaptation by identifying a hybrid physics simulator to match the simulated trajectories to the ones from the target domain, using a learned discriminative loss to address the limitations associated with manual loss design. Our hybrid simulator combines neural networks and traditional physics simulation to balance expressiveness and generalizability, and alleviates the need for a carefully selected parameter set in System ID. Once the hybrid simulator is identified via adversarial reinforcement learning, it can be used to refine policies for the target domain, without the need to interleave data collection and policy refinement. We show that our approach outperforms multiple strong baselines on six robotic locomotion tasks for domain adaptation.","Jiang, Yifeng; Zhang, Tingnan; Ho, Daniel; Bai, Yunfei; Liu, C.

Given the negative impacts of COVID-19 on all aspects of people's lives, especially health and economy, accurately forecasting the number of cases infected with this virus can help governments to make accurate decisions on the interventions that must be taken. In this study, we propose three hybrid approaches for forecasting COVID-19 time series methods based on combining three deep learning models such as multi-head attention, long short-term memory (LSTM), and convolutional neural network (CNN) with the Bayesian optimization algorithm. All models are designed based on the multiple-output forecasting strategy, which allows the forecasting of the multiple time points. The Bayesian optimization method automatically selects the best hyperparameters for each model and enhances forecasting performance. Using the publicly available epidemical data acquired from Johns Hopkins University's Coronavirus Resource Center, we conducted our experiments and evaluated the proposed models against the benchmark model. The results of experiments exhibit the superiority of the deep learning models over the benchmark model both for short-term forecasting and long-horizon forecasting. In particular, the mean SMAPE of the best deep learning model is 0.25 for the short-term forecasting (10 days ahead). Also, for long-horizon forecasting, the best deep learning model obtains the mean SMAPE of 2.59.","Abbasimehr, Hossein; Paki, Reza",Chaos Solitons Fractals,26,33

To provide an easy and fast COVID-19 severity risk score upon hospital admission, and keeping in mind the above limits, we sought for a scoring system needing limited invasive data such as a simple blood test and co-morbidity assessment by anamnesis. A retrospective study of 303 patients (203 from Bordeaux University hospital and an external independent cohort of 100 patients from Paris Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital) collected clinical and biochemical parameters at admission. Using stepwise model selection by Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), we built the severity score Covichem. Among 26 tested variables, 7: obesity, cardiovascular conditions, plasma sodium, albumin, ferritin, LDH and CK were the independent predictors of severity used in Covichem (accuracy 0.87, AUROC 0.91).

RESEARCH QUESTION: What are the contemporary trends and geographic variation in ARF and ARDS-related mortality in the United States? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the National Center for Health Statistics' nationwide mortality data was conducted to assess the ARF and ARDS-related mortality trends from 2014 through 2018 and the geographic distribution of ARF and ARDS-related deaths in 2018 for all American residents. Piecewise linear regression was used to evaluate the trends in age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMRs) in the overall population and various demographic subgroups of age, sex, race, urbanization, and region. RESULTS: Among 1,434,349 ARF-related deaths and 52,958 ARDS-related deaths during the study period, the AAMR was highest in older individuals (&#8805; 65 years), non-Hispanic Black people, and those living in the nonmetropolitan region. The AAMR for ARF-related deaths (per 100,000 people) increased from 74.9 (95% CI, 74.6-75.2) in 2014 to 85.6 (95% CI, 85.3-85.9) in 2018 (annual percentage change [APC], 3.4 [95% CI, 2.2-4.6]; Ptrend = .003). The AAMR (per 100,000 people) for ARDS-related deaths was 3.2 (95% CI, 3.2-3.3) in 2014 and 3.0 (95% CI, 3.0-3.1; APC, -0.9 [95% CI, -5.4 to 3.8]; Ptrend = .56). The observed increase in rates for ARF mortality was consistent across the subgroups of age, sex, race or ethnicity, urbanization status, and geographical region (Ptrend < .05 for all). The AAMR (per 100,000 people) for ARF (91.3 [95% CI, 90.8-91.8]) and ARDS-related mortality (3.3 [95% CI, 32.34]) in 2018 were highest in the South. INTERPRETATION: The ARF-related mortality increased at approximately 3.4% annually, and ARDS-related mortality showed a lack of decline in the last 5 years. These data contextualize important health information to guide priorities for research, clinical care, and policy, especially during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic in the United States.","Parcha, Vibhu; Kalra, Rajat; Bhatt, Surya P; Berra, Lorenzo; Arora, Garima; Arora, Pankaj",Chest,26,13

The gold standard method for SARS-CoV-2 detection requires both reverse transcription (RT) of the virus RNA to cDNA and then polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the cDNA amplification, which involves multiple enzymes, multiple reactions and a complicated assay optimization process. Here, we developed a duplex-specific nuclease (DSN)-based signal amplification method for SARS-CoV-2 detection directly from the virus RNA utilizing two specific DNA probes. These specific DNA probes can hybridize to the target RNA at different locations in the nucleocapsid protein gene (N gene) of SARS-CoV-2 to form a DNA/RNA heteroduplex. DSN cleaves the DNA probe to release fluorescence, while leaving the RNA strand intact to be bound to another available probe molecule for further cleavage and fluorescent signal amplification. The optimized DSN amount, incubation temperature and incubation time were investigated in this work. Proof-of-principle SARS-CoV-2 detection was demonstrated with a detection sensitivity of 500 pM virus RNA. This simple, rapid, and direct RNA detection method is expected to provide a complementary method for the detection of viruses mutated at the PCR primer-binding regions for a more precise detection.","Liu, Meiqing; Li, Haoran; Jia, Yanwei; Mak, Pui-In; Martins, Rui P",,26,5

In this article, we analyse the manifestations of these market failures using data from an assembled database of COVID-19 related news items sourced from the Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone. Specifically, we identify how pre-existing market failure and failures of redistribution have led to the rise of three urgent crises in LMICs: a financial and liquidity crisis among private providers, a crisis of service provision and pricing, and an attendant crisis in state-provider relations. The COVID-19 pandemic has therfore exposed important failures of the public-private models of health systems and provides an opportunity to rethink the future orientation of national health systems and commitments towards Universal Health Coverage.","David Williams, Owain; Yung, Ka Chun; Grépin, Karen A",Glob Public Health,26,26

Although researchers have looked at the implications of rounding continuous random variables, rounding may be applied to functions of discrete random variables as well. For example, to infer on suicide difference between two time periods, authorities may provide a rounded average of deaths for each period. Suicide rates tend to be relatively low around the world and such rounding may seriously affect inference on the change of suicide rate. In this paper, we study the scenario when a rounded to nearest integer average is used to estimate a non-negative discrete random variable. Specifically, our interest is in drawing inference on a parameter from the pmf of Y, when we get U=n[Y/n]as a proxy for Y. The probability generating function of U, E(U), and Var(U) capture the effect of the coarsening of the support of Y. Also, moments and estimators of distribution parameters are explored for some special cases. Under certain conditions, there is little impact from rounding. However, we also find scenarios where rounding can significantly affect statistical inference as demonstrated in two applications. The simple methods we propose are able to partially counter rounding error effects.","Rivera, Roberto; Cortes-Cubero, Axel; Reyes-Carranza, Roberto; Rolke, Wolfgang",,26,24

This study aimed to assess the association of the plasma RDW levels with adverse prognosis in COVID-19 patients. A comprehensive literature search from inception to September 2020 was performed to harvest original studies reporting RDW on admission and clinical outcomes among patients hospitalized with COVID-19. RDW levels were compared between cases (patients who died or developed more severe symptoms) and controls (patients who survived or developed less severe symptoms). A total of 14,866 subjects from 10 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Higher levels of RDW were associated with adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients (mean differences = 0.72; 95% CI = 0.47-0.97; I2 = 89.51%). Deceased patients had higher levels of RDW compared to patients who survived (mean differences = 0.93; 95% CI = 0.63-1.23; I2 = 85.58%). Severely ill COVID-19 patients showed higher levels of RDW, as opposed to patients classified to have milder symptoms (mean differences = 0.61; 95% CI = 0.28-0.94; I2 = 82.18%). Elevated RDW levels were associated with adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients. This finding warrants further research on whether RDW could be utilized as a simple and reliable biomarker for predicting COVID-19 severity and whether RDW is mechanistically linked with COVID-19 pathophysiology.","Lee, Jane J; Montazerin, Sahar M; Jamil, Adeel; Jamil, Umer; Marszalek, Jolanta; Chuang, Michael L; Chi, Gerald",J Med Virol,26,20

To date, no work has assessed how this guidance differs across governments. OBJECTIVE: This study seeks to contribute to a rational and consistent global response to infectious disease by determining how guidelines differ across nations and regions. METHODS: A content analysis of health agency mask guidelines on agency websites was performed in late March 2020 among 25 countries and regions with large numbers of COVID-19 cases. Countries and regions were assigned across the coding team by language proficiency, with Google Translate used as needed. When available, both the original and English language version of guidance were reviewed. RESULTS: All examined countries and regions had some form of guidance online, although detail and clarity differed. Although 9 countries and regions recommended surgical, medical, or unspecified masks in public and poorly ventilated places, 16 recommended against people wearing masks in public. There were 2 countries that explicitly recommended against fabric masks. In addition, 12 failed to outline the minimum basic World Health Organization guidance for masks. CONCLUSIONS: Online guidelines for face mask use to prevent COVID-19 in the general public are currently inconsistent across nations and regions, and have been changing often. Efforts to create greater standardization and clarity should be explored in light of the status of COVID-19 as a global pandemic.","Laestadius, Linnea; Wang, Yang; Ben Taleb, Ziyad; Kalan, Mohammad Ebrahimi; Cho, Young; Manganello, Jennifer",JMIR Public Health Surveill,26,23

These two CoV infections killed thousands of patients infected worldwide. However, WHO has still reported the MERS case in December 2019 in middle-eastern country (Saudi Arabia), indicating the MERS epidemic has not ended completely yet.

Molecular tests are not sufficiently sensitive, and results are usually not available in time for decision making in the ED. Chest x-ray (CXR) is a poor diagnostic test for COVID-19, and computed tomography (CT), while sensitive, is impractical as a diagnostic test for all patients. Lung ultrasound (LUS) has an established role in the evaluation of acute respiratory failure and has been used during the COVID-19 outbreak as a decision support tool. LUS shows characteristic changes in viral pneumonitis, and while these changes are not specific for COVID-19, it may be a useful adjunct during the diagnostic process. It is quick to perform and repeat and may be done at the bedside. The authors believe that LUS can help to mitigate uncertainty in undifferentiated patients with respiratory symptoms. This review aims to provide guidance regarding indications for LUS, describe the typical sonographic abnormalities seen in patients with COVID-19 and provide recommendations around the logistics of performing LUS on patients with COVID-19 and managing the infection control risk of the procedure. The risk of anchoring bias during a pandemic and the need to consider alternative pathologies are emphasised throughout this review.

Understanding the root cause of the instability of these vaccines may help to rationally improve mRNA-LNP product stability and thereby ease the temperature conditions for storage. In this review we discuss proposed structures of mRNA-LNPs, factors that impact mRNA-LNP stability and strategies to optimize mRNA-LNP product stability. Analysis of mRNA-LNP structures reveals that mRNA, the ionizable cationic lipid and water are present in the LNP core. The neutral helper lipids are mainly positioned in the outer, encapsulating, wall. mRNA hydrolysis is the determining factor for mRNA-LNP instability. It is currently unclear how water in the LNP core interacts with the mRNA and to what extent the degradation prone sites of mRNA are protected through a coat of ionizable cationic lipids. To improve the stability of mRNA-LNP vaccines, optimization of the mRNA nucleotide composition should be prioritized. Secondly, a better understanding of the milieu the mRNA is exposed to in the core of LNPs may help to rationalize adjustments to the LNP structure to preserve mRNA integrity. Moreover, drying techniques, such as lyophilization, are promising options still to be explored.","Schoenmaker, Linde; Witzigmann, Dominik; Kulkarni, Jayesh A; Verbeke, Rein; Kersten, Gideon; Jiskoot, Wim; Crommelin, Daan J A",Int J Pharm,26,26

This policy could potentially influence stroke prevention and management. We conducted a large population survey to assess the impact of mandatory social isolation on emergency consultations, routine health controls and the behavior of the population during the pandemic. Methods: We distributed multiple-choice anonymous questionnaires through the institutional email database and through the email database of clients of a beverage distribution company. Most respondents resided in the Metropolitan Area of Buenos Aires. This is the area where the infection rates were higher and restriction measures were stricter. The survey assessed demographic characteristics and actual and potential behaviors of people regarding medical checkups, risk factors control, medication provision and response to onset of symptoms consistent with stroke or TIA. Results: A total of 10,303 questionnaires were completed. Thirty-seven percent of the respondents were older than 60 years, 74% were women and 16% lived alone. One or more vascular risk factors were present in 39% of respondents. Seventy-six percent of participants did not continue to attend to their regular medical checkups during the mandatory social preventive isolation, 21% had difficulty obtaining medical prescriptions and only 38% considered hospitals were implementing appropriate measures to avoid COVID-19 infections. When asked about response in case of onset of stroke symptoms, 9% would not consult given the context of the pandemic. Six percent reported having had symptoms consistent with stroke or TIA and only 35% of those consulted in anEmergency Room. Most of the respondents (85%) reported they were waiting for the end of thequarantine to resume their usual medical care. Conclusions: The implementation of a strict quarantine may have some serious adverse effects onthe proper prevention and treatment of stroke. Careful communication and better educationstrategies are needed to keep the population safe during the pandemic while avoiding increases inthe risk of occurrence of other devastating diseases as stroke.","Perez, M.

We sought to determine the rate of seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies and of acute asymptomatic infection among firefighter first responders in a single county with early exposure in the pandemic. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of clinically active firefighters cross-trained as paramedics or EMTs in the fire departments of Santa Clara County, California. Firefighters without current symptoms were tested between June and August 2020. Our primary outcomes were rates of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody seropositivity and SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR swab positivity for acute infection. We report cumulative incidence, participant characteristics with frequencies and proportions, and proportion positive and associated relative risk (with 95% confidence intervals). Results: We enrolled 983 out of 1339 eligible participants (response rate: 73.4%).

Existing evidence shows their benefits in improving outcomes, especially for chronic disease patients. However, their use has not been as widespread as expected partly due to barriers faced in their adoption and use. We aimed to identify the types of barriers to a patient, provider, and caregiver adoption/use of ePHRs and to analyze their extent in chronic disease care. METHODS: A systematic search in Medline, PubMed, Science Direct, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) database was performed to find original studies assessing barriers to ePHR adoption/use in chronic care until the end of 2018. Two researchers independently screened and extracted data. We used the PHR adoption model and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology to analyze the results. The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) version 2018 was used to assess the quality of evidence in the included studies. RESULTS: Sixty publications met our inclusion criteria. Issues found hindering ePHR adoption/use in chronic disease care were associated with demographic factors (e.g., patient age and gender) along with key variables related to health status, computer literacy, preferences for direct communication, and patient's strategy for coping with a chronic condition; as well as factors related to medical practice/environment (e.g., providers' lack of interest or resistance to adopting ePHRs due to workload, lack of reimbursement, and lack of user training); technological (e.g., concerns over privacy and security, interoperability with electronic health record systems, and lack of customized features for chronic conditions); and chronic disease characteristics (e.g., multiplicities of co-morbid conditions, settings, and providers involved in chronic care). CONCLUSIONS: ePHRs can be meaningfully used in chronic disease care if they are implemented as a component of comprehensive care models specifically developed for this care. Our results provide insight into hurdles and barriers mitigating ePHR adoption/use in chronic disease care. A deeper understating of the interplay between these barriers will provide opportunities that can lead to an enhanced ePHR adoption/use.","Niazkhani, Zahra; Toni, Esmaeel; Cheshmekaboodi, Mojgan; Georgiou, Andrew; Pirnejad, Habibollah",BMC Med Inform Decis Mak,26,26

While areas within the urban space (metropolitan mobile space) are being developed, rural areas are left behind. Due to challenges of low population density, low income, difficult terrain, non-existent infrastructure, lack of power grid, remote areas have low digital penetration. This situation makes remote areas less attractive towards investments and to operate connectivity networks, thus failing to achieve universal access to the Internet. In addressing this issue, this paper proposes a new BS deployment and resource management method for remote and rural areas. Here, two MN operators share their resources towards the procurement and deployment of green energy-powered BSs equipped with computing capabilities. Then, the network infrastructure is shared between the mobile operators, with the main goal of enabling energy-efficient infrastructure sharing, i.e., BS and its co-located computing platform. Using this resource management strategy in rural communication sites guarantees a Quality of Service (QoS) comparable to that of urban communication sites. The performance evaluation conducted through simulations validates our analysis as the prediction variations observed shows greater accuracy between the harvested energy and the traffic load. Also, the energy savings decrease as the number of mobile users (50 users in our case) connected to the remote site increases. Lastly, the proposed algorithm achieves 51% energy savings when compared with the 43% obtained by our benchmark algorithm. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance over the benchmark algorithm as it uses foresighted optimization where the harvested energy and the expected load are predicted over a given short-term horizon.","Dlamini, Thembelihle; Vilakati, Sifiso",,26,13

We aim to study the correlation between myocardial muscle injury and specific echocardiographic findings and, hence the association with mortality. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort at the University Medical Center in Lubbock, Texas, under IRB of L20-172. We included COVID-19 patients from March 2020 until July 2020 who had transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) during their hospital admission. Myocardial muscle injury was defined by elevated troponin. Results A total of 101 patients were included. The mean age was 60 years, and 69.3 % were males. A total of 66 patients had a myocardial injury. Patients with myocardial injury had higher mortality than those without myocardial injury with a P-value of &lt; 0.05, and this value remained significant after running a multiple regression analysis model.

Currently, no effective medical treatment exists to combat this disease. Traditional Chinese herbal medicines (CHM) have unique roles in the treatment of viral infections. In this article we analyzed the effectiveness and possible molecular mechanisms of CHM formulas for the prevention of COVID-19. METHODS: The active ingredients and action targets of CHM formulas were obtained from the TCMSP database. Genes related to severe acute respiratory syndromes (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) were queried on the GeneCards database. The action mechanisms of these genes were predicted using a Gene Ontology (GO)-based functional enrichment and annotation tool and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). RESULTS: CHM formulas played a positive role in preventing COVID-19 and warrant further application. CONCLUSIONS: Our research provides new evidence to support the possible value of CHM formulas for the prevention of COVID-19. However, further clinical studies with large sample sizes are required to verify their effectiveness.","Yu, Shengwei; Wang, Junwu; Shen, Haitao",Ann Palliat Med,26,1

Several typical characteristics are present in this infection, in particular pneumonia with possible lung failure, but atypical clinical presentations are being described daily by physicians around the world. Ground-glass opacities with pneumonia are the most common and dangerous presentations of the COVID-19 disease, and they are usually associated with positive nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) tests with detectable SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA. Compared to the general population, hospital workers have been at a greater risk of infection ever since the first patients were hospitalized. However, hospital workers have also been reported as having COVID-like symptoms despite repeated negative swab tests but having tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with serological tests. We can postulate that a COVID-like syndrome is possible, in particular in hospital workers, that is characterized by symptoms similar to those of COVID-19, but with repeated negative nasopharyngeal swabs. These repeated negative NSPs make the difference in daily clinical management with people that experienced a single false negative nasopharyngeal swab;furthermore, a clear clinical differentiation of these situations is still lacking in the literature. For this reason, here, we report our main findings from a cohort of patients with a COVID-like syndrome compared to a similar group affected by typical COVID-19.","Di Micco, Pierpaolo Camporese Giuseppe Russo Vincenzo Cardillo Giuseppe Imbalzano Egidio Tufano Antonella Bernardi Enrico Fontanella Andrea",Journal of Clinical Medicine,26,1

They have caused a drastic change in the everyday lives of people living in urbanized areas, and are considered to contribute to a modified perception of the public space. As research related to the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on mental health and well-being emerges, the associated longitudinal changes of brain hemodynamics in healthy adults remain largely unknown. (2) Methods: this study examined the hemodynamic activation patterns of the prefrontal and occipital cortices of 12 participants (5 male, Mage = 47.80, SDage = 17.79, range 25 to 74, and 7 female, Mage = 39.00, SDage = 18.18, range 21 to 65) passively viewing videos from three urban sites in Singapore (Urban Park, Neighborhood Landscape and City Center) at two different time points-T1, before the COVID-19 pandemic and T2, soon after the lockdown was over. (3) Results: We observed a significant and marginally significant decrease in average oxyhemoglobin (Oxy-Hb) over time for each of the visual conditions. For both green spaces (Urban Park and Neighborhood Landscape), the decrease was in the visual cortex, while for the City Center with no green elements, the marginal decrease was observed in the visual cortex and the frontal eye fields. (4) Conclusions: The results suggest that the COVID-19-related lockdown experienced by urban inhabitants may have contributed to decreased brain hemodynamics, which are further related to a heightened risk of mental health disorders, such as depression or a decline in cognitive functions. Moreover, the busy City Center scenes induced a hemodynamic pattern associated with stress and anxiety, while urban green spaces did not cause such an effect. Urban green scenes can be an important factor to offset the negative neuropsychological impact of busy urban environments post-pandemic.","Olszewska-Guizzo, Agnieszka; Mukoyama, Ayako; Naganawa, Sho; Dan, Ippeita; Husain, Syeda Fabeha; Ho, Cyrus S; Ho, Roger",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),26,1

In this study, we investigated the therapeutic effect of GM1 ganglioside in experimental models of Parkinson's disease (PD) in vivo and in vitro. Mice were injected with MPTP (30 mg·kg-1·d-1, i.p.) for 5 days, resulting in a subacute model of PD. PD mice were treated with GM1 ganglioside (25, 50 mg·kg-1·d-1, i.p.) for 2 weeks. We showed that GM1 ganglioside administration substantially improved the MPTP-induced behavioral disturbance and increased the levels of dopamine and its metabolites in the striatal tissues. In the MPP+-treated SH-SY5Y cells and &#945;-synuclein (&#945;-Syn) A53T-overexpressing PC12 (PC12&#945;-Syn A53T) cells, treatment with GM1 ganglioside (40 µM) significantly decreased &#945;-Syn accumulation and alleviated mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. We further revealed that treatment with GM1 ganglioside promoted autophagy, evidenced by the autophagosomes that appeared in the substantia nigra of PD mice as well as the changes of autophagy-related proteins (LC3-II and p62) in the MPP+-treated SH-SY5Y cells. Cotreatment with the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA or bafilomycin A1 abrogated the in vivo and in vitro neuroprotective effects of GM1 ganglioside. Using GM1 ganglioside labeled with FITC fluorescent, we observed apparent colocalization of GM1-FITC and &#945;-Syn as well as GM1-FITC and LC3 in PC12&#945;-Syn A53T cells. GM1 ganglioside significantly increased the phosphorylation of autophagy regulatory proteins ATG13 and ULK1 in doxycycline-treated PC12&#945;-Syn A53T cells and the MPP+-treated SH-SY5Y cells, which was inhibited by 3-MA. Taken together, this study demonstrates that the anti-PD role of GM1 ganglioside resulted from activation of autophagy-dependent &#945;-Syn clearance.","Guo, Yu-Lin; Duan, Wen-Jun; Lu, Dan-Hua; Ma, Xiao-Hui; Li, Xiao-Xiao; Li, Zhao; Bi, Wei; Kurihara, Hiroshi; Liu, Hai-Zhi; Li, Yi-Fang; He, Rong-Rong",Acta pharmacol.

This situation has been worsened even more by the COVID-19 restrictions embraced by employers worldwide. However, a timely and sustainable intervention protocol for treating such issues has not been developed yet. Thus, the present research shows a first effective attempt based on Metacognitive therapy (MCT) to solve this issue. MCT was practiced on four individuals suffering from chronic work-related stress. Primary outcome variables were general mental health, perceived stress, and blood pressure. Participants were assessed at multiple baselines before the start of therapy and then attended a 3- and 6-months follow-up after treatment termination. Results showed significant improvements in general mental health, perceived stress, and blood pressure in each client. Secondary outcome variables improved too—maladaptive coping strategies, avoidance behaviors, and depression symptoms—corroborating the main findings. At 3- and 6-month follow-up, results were maintained. The findings suggest that MCT might be a promising and sustainable intervention for work-related stress, although a metacognitive model for stress and large-scale RCTs need to be developed and carried out to further explore the effect of MCT on stress. Our results represent one of the first attempts to treat work-related stress via Metacognitive Therapy and support the feasibility of the treatment, both in terms of its efficacy and sustainability, in a historical moment in which work-related stress is increased worldwide because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Within such a realm, our feasibility study should be followed by larger and controlled studies that, if successful, would provide various stakeholders—including organizational and institutional decision-makers—with a solid, timely and cost-effective method to help the workforce coping with work-related stress.","De Dominicis, S.; Troen, M.

METHODS: We undertook an integrative literature review informed by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42019138938). Electronic databases were systematically search using keywords and hand searching of reference articles and grey literature was also completed. RESULTS: Ten empirical studies and five theoretical articles were included in the synthesis. Empirical studies provided more information about meeting structure, whereas theoretical articles more frequently described a desired process for planning and undertaking meetings. No articles identified how the success of a meeting was defined or made recommendations for doing so. Despite reports that family meetings are commonly occurring, few articles described outcomes from either the family or clinician perspectives. CONCLUSIONS: Family meetings are essential communication strategies commonly used in paediatric palliative care, yet there is little guidance about how meetings should be organised and conducted, who should participate and when they should occur. The limited data available on the outcomes of family meetings suggest improvements are required to meet the needs of families. We present a framework that synthesises the available evidence. The framework offers an overview of the elements to consider when planning for and undertaking family meetings in paediatric palliative care and may be useful for both clinicians and researchers.","Bradford, Natalie; Rolfe, Melanie; Ekberg, Stuart; Mitchell, Geoffrey; Beane, Theresa; Ferranti, Kahli; Herbert, Anthony",BMJ support. palliat. care (Online),26,26

Although the majority of patients admitted with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) may not be infected with COVID-19, the quarantine and public health emergency measures may have affected this particular high risk group. The objective of this study is to assess the impact of the early period of the COVID-19 pandemic on ACS admissions and clinical course in a tertiary care hospital in Portugal's most affected region. METHODS: This retrospective, case-control study included patients admitted with a diagnosis of ACS during March and April 2020 (pandemic group) and in the same period in 2019 (control group). Clinical course and complications were also assessed. RESULTS: During the pandemic, there were fewer ACS admissions but presentation was more severe, with a larger proportion of acute ST-elevation myocardial infarctions (54.9% vs. 38.8%, p=0.047), higher maximum troponin levels and greater prevalence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction at discharge (58.0% vs. 35.0%, p=0.01). In this population, although not statistically significant, it was observed a delay between the onset of symptoms and percutaneous coronary intervention, which may traduce a deferred search for urgent medical care during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: The lockdown phase of COVID-19 pandemic was associated with fewer and more severe ACS in a Tertiary Care Hospital in Portugal's most affected region by the pandemic.","Calvão, João; Amador, Ana Filipa; Costa, Catarina Martins da; Araújo, Paulo Maia; Pinho, Teresa; Freitas, João; Amorim, Sandra; Macedo, Filipe",Rev. port. cardiol,26,26

The long-term respiratory sequelae in such patients remain unclear. RESEARCH QUESTION: What are the major long-term pulmonary sequelae in critical patients who survive COVID-19? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Consecutive patients with COVID-19 requiring ICU admission were recruited and evaluated 3 months after hospitalization discharge. The follow-up comprised symptom and quality of life, anxiety and depression questionnaires, pulmonary function tests, exercise test (6-min walking test [6MWT]), and chest CT imaging. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-five patients admitted to the ICU with ARDS secondary to COVID-19 were recruited between March and June 2020. At the 3-month follow-up, 62 patients were available for pulmonary evaluation. The most frequent symptoms were dyspnea (46.7%) and cough (34.4%). Eighty-two percent of patients showed a lung diffusing capacity of less than 80%. The median distance in the 6MWT was 400 m (interquartile range, 362-440 m). CT scans showed abnormal results in 70.2% of patients, demonstrating reticular lesions in 49.1% and fibrotic patterns in 21.1%. Patients with more severe alterations on chest CT scan showed worse pulmonary function and presented more degrees of desaturation in the 6MWT. Factors associated with the severity of lung damage on chest CT scan were age and length of invasive mechanical ventilation during the ICU stay. INTERPRETATION: Three months after hospital discharge, pulmonary structural abnormalities and functional impairment are highly prevalent in patients with ARDS secondary to COVID-19 who required an ICU stay. Pulmonary evaluation should be considered for all critical COVID-19 survivors 3 months after discharge.","González, Jessica; Benítez, Iván D; Carmona, Paola; Santisteve, Sally; Monge, Aida; Moncusí-Moix, Anna; Gort-Paniello, Clara; Pinilla, Lucía; Carratalá, Amara; Zuil, María; Ferrer, Ricard; Ceccato, Adrián; Fernández, Laia; Motos, Ana; Riera, Jordi; Menéndez, Rosario; Garcia-Gasulla, Dario; Peñuelas, Oscar; Bermejo-Martin, Jesús F; Labarca, Gonzalo; Caballero, Jesus; Torres, Gerard; de Gonzalo-Calvo, David; Torres, Antoni; Barbé, Ferran",Chest,26,1

SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus that has become a major public health concern after the outbreak of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-CoV (SARS-CoV) in 2002 and 2012, respectively. As of October 29, 2020, the total number of COVID-19 cases had reached over 44 million worldwide, with more than 1.17 million confirmed deaths. DISCUSSION: SARS-CoV-2 infected patients usually present with severe viral pneumonia. Similar to SARS-CoV, the virus enters respiratory tract cells via the angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor 2. The structural proteins play an essential role in budding the virus particles released from different host cells. To date, an approved vaccine or treatment option of a preventive character to avoid severe courses of COVID-19 is still not available. CONCLUSION: In this study, we provide a brief review of the general biological features of CoVs and explain the pathogenesis, clinical symptoms, and diagnostic approaches regarding monitoring future infectivity and prevent emerging COVID-19 infections.","Mohamadian, Malihe; Chiti, Hossein; Shoghli, Alireza; Biglari, Sajjad; Parsamanesh, Negin; Esmaeilzadeh, Abdolreza",J Gene Med,26,16

Among their possible pharmacological actions, the ability to act against viruses belonging to different families, including SARS coronavirus, is particularly important. With the COVID-19 emergency and the urgent need for compounds to counteract the pandemic, the antiviral properties of GR and GA, as pure substances or as components of licorice extract, attracted attention in the last year and supported the launch of two clinical trials. In silico docking studies reported that GR and GA may directly interact with the key players in viral internalization and replication such as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), spike protein, the host transmembrane serine protease 2, and 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease. In vitro data indicated that GR can interfere with virus entry by directly interacting with ACE2 and spike, with a nonspecific effect on cell and viral membranes. Additional anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of GR cannot be excluded. These multiple activities of GR and licorice extract are critically re-assessed in this review, and their possible role against the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 and the features of COVID-19 disease is discussed.","Diomede, Luisa; Beeg, Marten; Gamba, Alessio; Fumagalli, Oscar; Gobbi, Marco; Salmona, Mario",Biomolecules,26,24

In this article we ask what can account for this variation in policy responses, and we identify a number of factors related to institutions, general governance and specific health-sector related capacities, societal trust, government type, and party preferences as possible determinants. Using multivariate regression and survival analysis, we model the speed with which school closures and national lockdowns were imposed. The models suggest a number of significant and often counterintuitive relationships: more centralized countries with &lt;italic&gt;lower&lt;/italic&gt; government effectiveness, freedom and societal trust, but with separate ministries of health and health ministers with medical background acted faster and more decisively. High perceived capacity might have provided false confidence to the governments, resulting in a delayed response to the early stages of the pandemic. Furthermore, more right-wing and authoritarian governments responded faster.

This paper aims to examine the CT imaging characteristics of COVID-19. METHODS: We evaluated CT images obtained between 10 January 2019 and 16 February 2020 at Taihe Hospital. Scans were conducted 2-6 times per patient and the re-testing interval was 2-7 days. Ninety-five patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test results were included in this study and we retrospectively analysed their CT imaging characteristics. RESULTS: Ninety-five patients underwent 2-3 SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests and received a definitive diagnosis of COVID-19. Fifty-three were male and 42 were female, and their mean age was 42 ± 12 years (range: 10 months to 81 years). Sixty-nine patients (72.6%) experienced fever, fatigue, and dry cough, while 15 (15.8%) had poor appetite and fatigue, and 11 (11.6%) had a dry cough and no fever. On CT imaging, early stage patients (n = 53, 55.8%) showed peripheral subpleural ground-glass opacities; these were mainly local patches (22/53, 41.5%), while some lesions were accompanied by interlobular septal thickening. Thirty-four (35.8%) patients were classified in the 'progression stage' based on CT imaging; these patients typically showed lesions in multiple lung segments and lobes (21/34ï¼61.8%), and an uneven increase in ground-glass opacity density accompanied by consolidation and grid-like or cord-like shadows(30.5%). Two patients (2.1%) showed a severe presentation on CT. These showed diffuse bilateral lung lesions, mixed ground-glass opacities and consolidation with cord-like interstitial thickening and air bronchograms, entire lung involvement with a ""white lung"" presentation, and mild pleural effusion. Six patients in remission (6.3%), visible lesion absorption, fibrotic lesions. Based on clinical signs, 71 (74.7%), 22 (23.2%), and 2 (2.1%) patients had mild or moderate, severe, and critical disease, respectively. Within the follow-up period, 93 patients recovered and were discharged, including the 53 early stage patients and 34 progression stage patients. The length of hospitalisation was 7-28 days (mean: 10 ± 3.5 days). On discharge, lesions were significantly reduced in area and had in many cases completely disappeared, while slight pulmonary fibrosis was present in some patients. One severe stage patient was still hospitalised at the end of the follow-up period and the other severe stage patient died. The overall mortality rate was 1.05%. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding the CT imaging characteristics of COVID-19 is important for early lesion detection, determining the nature of lesions, and assessing disease severity.","Cui, Ning; Zou, Xugong; Xu, Lin",Clin Imaging,26,1

Recently, a sensitive quantitative antigen test (SQT), Lumipulse® SARS-CoV-2 Ag, was developed. It is a fully automated chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay system for SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: In this study, the analytical performance of SQT was examined using clinical specimens from nasopharyngeal swabs using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) as a control. RESULTS: Receiver operating characteristic analysis of 24 SARS-CoV-2-positive and 524 -negative patients showed an area under the curve of 0.957 ± 0.063. Using a cut-off value of 1.34 pg/ml, the sensitivity was 91.7%, the specificity was 98.5%, and the overall rate of agreement was 98.2%. In the distribution of negative cases, the 99.5 percentile value was 1.03 pg/ml. There was a high correlation between the viral load calculated using the cycle threshold value of RT-PCR and the concentration of antigen. The tendency for the antigen concentration to decrease with time after disease onset correlated with that of the viral load. CONCLUSIONS: Presented results indicate that SQT is highly concordant with RT-PCR and should be useful for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in any clinical setting. Therefore, this fully automated kit will contribute to the expansion of the testing capability for SARS-CoV-2.","Aoki, Kotaro; Nagasawa, Tatsuya; Ishii, Yoshikazu; Yagi, Shintaro; Okuma, Sadatsugu; Kashiwagi, Katsuhito; Maeda, Tadashi; Miyazaki, Taito; Yoshizawa, Sadako; Tateda, Kazuhiro",J. infect. chemother,26,16

The student cohort is diverse, with students enrolled in courses with a laboratory focus, such as Laboratory Medicine, Medical Science, Nutrition and Food Science and Pharmaceutical Science. The course is taught in a traditional manner, with weekly lectures, fortnightly tutorials and three practical sessions. In response to the growing numbers of COVID-19 cases, in mid-March the University leadership moved to cease face-to-face teaching. By this time, 58 of 96 students had completed the first two (of three) face-to-face laboratory practicals. In response to this decision, teaching of all practical based content was moved online for all students. The first question was, how do we teach practical content online? And secondly, how do we teach hands-on skills? The first question was addressed using a suite of online simulations, progressively developed since 2013. Simulations are widely used and shown to be useful as teaching aids in STEM. A total of five simulations were introduced each covering key aspects of laboratory practice, including fundamental mathematical skills, reading, and setting a pipette, basic Biochemistry assays, protein quantification, and enzyme kinetics. The second issue of teaching hands on skills was addressed once restrictions were eased. Students were invited to attend the laboratory to learn the kinesthetic skills with instructor guidance. Both approaches used proved to be highly effective and can be readily adapted not only to teaching Biochemistry, but any aspect of science education.","Costabile, Maurizio",,26,16

Studies that evaluate the outcome of this rapid teletherapy adoption and implementation are pertinent. OBJECTIVE: This single-arm, nonrandomized pilot study aimed to assess the feasibility and initial patient-level outcomes of a psychiatric transitional day program that switched from an in-person group to a video teletherapy group during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Patients with transdiagnostic conditions who were at risk of psychiatric hospitalization were referred to the Adult Transitions Program (ATP) at a large academic medical center in the United States. ATP was a 3-week intensive outpatient program that implemented group teletherapy guided by cognitive and behavioral principles delivered daily for 3 hours per day. Feasibility was assessed via retention, attendance rate, and rate of securing aftercare appointments prior to ATP discharge. Patients completed standardized patient-reported outcome measures at admission and discharge to assess the effectiveness of the program for improving quality of mental health, depression, anxiety, and suicide risk. RESULTS: Patients (N=76) started the program between March and August of 2020. Feasibility was established, with 70 of the 76 patients (92%) completing the program and a mean attendance of 14.43 days (SD 1.22); also, 71 patients (95%) scheduled at least one behavioral health aftercare service prior to ATP discharge. All patient-level reported outcomes demonstrated significant improvements in depression (95% CI -3.6 to -6.2; Cohen d=0.77; P<.001), anxiety (95% CI -3.0 to -4.9; Cohen d=0.74; P<.001), overall suicide risk (95% CI -0.5 to -0.1; Cohen d=0.41; P=.02), wish to live (95% CI 0.3 to 1.0; Cohen d=0.39; P<.001), wish to die (95% CI -0.2 to -1.4; Cohen d=0.52; P=.01), and overall mental health (95% CI 1.5 to 4.5; Cohen d=0.39; P<.001) from admission to discharge. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid adoption and implementation of a group-based teletherapy day program for adults at risk of psychiatric hospitalization appeared to be feasible and effective. Patients demonstrated high completion and attendance rates and reported significant improvements in psychosocial outcomes. Larger trials should be conducted to further evaluate the efficacy and effectiveness of the program through randomized controlled trials.","Puspitasari, Ajeng J; Heredia, Dagoberto; Coombes, Brandon J; Geske, Jennifer R; Gentry, Melanie T; Moore, Wendy R; Sawchuk, Craig N; Schak, Kathryn M",JMIR Ment Health,26,20

Intimate Partner Violence Under Forced Coexistence and Economic Uncertainty,20.341434,3.3666875,2020,"This article revisits the concept of relative deprivation and asks whether it is still useful for criminology. The article traces the way relative deprivation has been used in the past to understand crime and how it has connections to other, more recent, additions to debates on social justice. I argue that relative deprivation has disappeared even in the place that it had become the key explanation for crime-left realism. In so doing, I explore the resurrection of left realism in criminology-what I refer to as ""post-millennial left realism""-first, by those who were associated with it originally, and then with Hall and Winlow's (2015, 2017) shift in emphasis to what they term ""ultra-realism."" I maintain that relative deprivation is still a powerful concept for bridging several related areas that should still be central to the concerns of criminology-in part, because it is still a major concern in popular social science and social psychology. Why has it disappeared in criminology? I present an argument that suggests that the absence of certain research methods, such as ethnographic and qualitative or small-scale survey methods, has impoverished our understanding of the lived reality of people experiencing the social transformations of a networked, precarious society. The massive polarization and disruption in politics and social discourse, as well as the worldwide economic, public health, and social transformations (ranging from the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter protests to the COVID-19 global pandemic) have demonstrated the continued relevance and analytical power that relative deprivation, in its elaborated form, brings to questions of crime and justice.","Webber, Craig",Crit Criminol,26,1

For instance, to identify COVID-19 positive patients or people's emotions on COVID-19 pandemic from tweets written in 35 different languages faster and accurate, language categorization and processing of tweets is significantly essential. Among many language categorization and processing techniques, character and word n-gram based techniques are very popular and simple but very efficient for categorizing and processing both short and large documents. One of the fundamental problems of language processing is the efficient use of memory space in implementing a technique so that a vast collection of documents can be easily categorized and processed. In this paper, we introduce a framework that categorizes the language of tweets using n-gram based language categorization technique and further processes the tweets using the machine-learning approach, Linear Support Vector Machine (LSVM), that may be able to identify COVID-19 positive patients. We evaluate and compare the performance of the proposed framework in terms of language categorization accuracy, precession, recall, and F-measure over n-gram length. The proposed framework is scalable as many other applications that involve extracting features and classifying languages collected from social media, and different types of networks may use this framework. This proposed framework, also being a part of health monitoring and improvement, tends to achieve the goal of having a sustainable society.","Nasser, Nidal; Karim, Lutful; El Ouadrhiri, Ahmed; Ali, Asmaa; Khan, Nargis",Sustain Cities Soc,26,23

High levels of social connection are positively associated with beneficial health outcomes, while social isolation is associated with poor long-term health outcomes including reduced life expectancy. The present study evaluates the impact of social distancing measures during the early period of COVID-19 on substance use behaviors among those in the United States. Methods: We used an internet-based survey with participants (n = 157; 86 male) reporting a history of problems related to drug use. We relied on ANOVA and logistic regression techniques to assess the associations between social connection and substance use. Results: People with more severe drug use problems reported feeling more socially isolated during social distancing. Those who primarily use alcohol reported higher global feelings of social connection than those who primarily use opioids. During social distancing, participants reported an increase in alcohol and cigarette consumption, and a decrease in cocaine use. Lastly, those who reported using drugs for social reasons were less likely to have decreased substance use during social distancing. Conclusions: The current study provides evidence that social distancing guidelines have impacted both substance use behaviors and feelings of social and physical connection. Further, there are differential impacts based on drug of choice. These results advance delineation of the connection between sociality and drug use.","Christie, Nina C; Vojvodic, Vanya; Monterosso, John R",Subst Use Misuse,26,29

This brief literature review seeks to compile and catalogue the available data to elucidate characteristic features of such findings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Scientific articles and studies on intracranial microhemorrhages in the setting of COVID-19 were searched on PubMed, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Library. Included studies described intracranial microbleed(s) on magnetic resonance imaging in patients with COVID-19. If multiple patients were described, only patients with intracranial microhemorrhage on magnetic resonance imaging were included for analysis. Patient demographics, severity of illness (e.g. intensive care unit admission and/or intubation), time from diagnosis of COVID-19 to magnetic resonance imaging, and location(s) of any observed microhemorrhages were noted. RESULTS: A total of 39 patients with suspected intracranial microhemorrhages have been described in prior studies. The average age of patients was 64.7 years; 21.9% were women. The average time between COVID-19 diagnosis and magnetic resonance imaging was 31.7 days. All patients in the cohort were admitted to critical care and were either intubated or treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation during their clinical course. Microhemorrhages were most commonly located in the subcortical/juxtacortical white matter and corpus callosum. CONCLUSIONS: Intracranial microbleeds are a well-documented finding in patients with severe COVID-19, and are most commonly callosal and subcortical/juxtacortical in location.","Benson, John C; Hunt, Christopher H; Klaas, James P; Kallmes, David F",Neuroradiol J,26,1

Social capital is a measure of social trust, belonging, and participation. This study aimed to investigate the effects of social capital on sleep quality and the mechanisms involved in people who self-isolated at home for 14 days in January 2020 during the COVID-19 epidemic in central China. MATERIAL AND METHODS Individuals (n=170) who self-isolated at home for 14 days in central China, completed self-reported questionnaires on the third day of isolation. Individual social capital was assessed using the Personal Social Capital Scale 16 (PSCI-16) questionnaire. Anxiety was assessed using the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) questionnaire, stress was assessed using the Stanford Acute Stress Reaction (SASR) questionnaire, and sleep was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire. Path analysis was performed to evaluate the relationships between a dependent variable (social capital) and two or more independent variables, using Pearson's correlation analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM). RESULTS Low levels of social capital were associated with increased levels of anxiety and stress, but increased levels of social capital were positively associated with increased quality of sleep. Anxiety was associated with stress and reduced sleep quality, and the combination of anxiety and stress reduced the positive effects of social capital on sleep quality. CONCLUSIONS During a period of individual self-isolation during the COVID-19 virus epidemic in central China, increased social capital improved sleep quality by reducing anxiety and stress.","Xiao, Han; Zhang, Yan; Kong, Desheng; Li, Shiyue; Yang, Ningxi",Med Sci Monit,26,8

Most current serological evaluation of CP relies on examination of total immunoglobulin or IgG-specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels. However, IgA antibodies, which also circulate and are secreted along the respiratory mucosa, represent a relatively uncharacterized component of CP. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Residual samples from patients and CP donors were assessed for IgM, IgG, and IgA anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers against the receptor-binding domain responsible for viral entry. Symptom onset was obtained by chart review. RESULTS: Increased IgA anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels correlated with clinical improvement and viral clearance in an infant with COVID-19, prompting a broader examination of IgA levels among CP donors and hospitalized patients. Significant heterogeneity in IgA levels was observed among CP donors, which correlated weakly with IgG levels or the results of a commonly employed serological test. Unlike IgG and IgM, IgA levels were also more likely to be variable in hospitalized patients and this variability persisted in some patients >14 days following symptom onset. IgA levels were also less likely to be sustained than IgG levels following subsequent CP donation. CONCLUSIONS: IgA levels can be very heterogenous among CP donors and hospitalized patients and do not necessarily correlate with commonly employed testing platforms. Examining isotype levels in CP and COVID-19 patients may allow for a tailored approach when seeking to fill specific gaps in humoral immunity.","Verkerke, Hans; Saeedi, Bejan J; Boyer, Darra; Allen, Jerry W; Owens, Joshua; Shin, Sooncheon; Horwath, Michael; Patel, Kashyap; Paul, Anu; Wu, Shang-Chuen; Wang, Jianmei; Ho, Alex; Maier, Cheryl L; Zerra, Patricia E; Chonat, Satheesh; Arthur, Connie M; Roback, John D; Neish, Andrew S; Lough, Christopher; Josephson, Cassandra D; Stowell, Sean R",Transfusion,26,16

Esta análise apresenta perspectivas interesantes em cães, contudo, antes mesmo que possa ser utilizada, é pertinente que se estabeleça melhor compreensão sobre o comportamento fisiológico da modulação autonômica cardíaca. O objetivo desse estudo foi descrever um padrão característico de comportamento autonômico cardíaco em cães saudáveis em diferentes faixas etárias. Foi analisada a VFC no domínio do tempo e no domínio da frequência, utilizando o Holter e o frequencímetro em curto prazo em 87 cães. Observou-se que cães entre um e sete anos de idade, apresentaram maior VFC quando comparada a outras faixas etárias. Cães idosos (> 8 anos), exibiram tendência natural a diminuição dos marcadores parassimpáticos cardíacos da VFC, enquanto cães filhotes (< 1 ano), apresentaram maior predomínio simpático e consequentemente, menor VFC. Conclui-se que o balanço dos sistemas simpático e parassimpático, sofre influência da idade em cães, alterando os valores da VFC. Então é de extrema importância obter valores de referência, para futuras análises em diferentes afecções clínicas.

METHODS: Discharge outcomes were evaluated before and after prospective implementation of a real-time dashboard with feedback to ward-based clinicians. Thromboembolism categories were ""medium-risk"" (D-dimer >1000ng/mL or CRP >200mg/L); ""high-risk"" (D-dimer >3000ng/mL or CRP >250mg/L) or ""suspected"" (D-dimer >5000ng/mL). Cytokine storm risk was categorized by ferritin. RESULTS: 939/1039 COVID-19 positive patients (median age 67 years, 563/939 (60%) male) completed hospital encounters to death or discharge by 21st May 2020. Thromboembolism flag criteria were reached by 568/939 (60.5%), including 238/275 (86.6%) of the patients who died, and 330/664 (49.7%) of the patients who survived to discharge, p<0.0001. Cytokine storm flag criteria were reached by 212 (22.6%) of admissions, including 80/275 (29.1%) of the patients who died, and 132/664 (19.9%) of the patients who survived, p<0.0001. The maximum thromboembolism flag discriminated completed encounter mortality (no flag: 37/371 [9.97%] died; medium-risk: 68/239 [28.5%]; high-risk: 105/205 [51.2%]; and suspected thromboembolism: 65/124 [52.4%], p<0.0001). Flag criteria were reached by 535 consecutive COVID-19 positive patients whose hospital encounter completed before traffic-light introduction: 173/535 (32.3% [95% confidence intervals 28.0, 36.0]) died. For the 200 consecutive admissions after implementation of real-time traffic light flags, 46/200 (23.0% [95% confidence intervals 17.1, 28.9]) died, p=0.013. Adjusted for age and sex, the probability of death was 0.33 (95% confidence intervals 0.30, 0.37) before traffic light implementation, 0.22 (0.17, 0.27) after implementation, p<0.001. In subgroup analyses, older patients, males, and patients with hypertension (p&#8804;0.01), and/or diabetes (p=0.05) derived the greatest benefit from admission under the traffic light system. CONCLUSION: Personalized early interventions were associated with a 33% reduction in early mortality. We suggest benefit predominantly resulted from early triggers to review/enhance anticoagulation management, without exposing lower-risk patients to potential risks of full anticoagulation therapy.","Vizcaychipi, Marcela P; Shovlin, Claire L; McCarthy, Alex; Godfrey, Andrew; Patel, Sheena; Shah, Pallav L; Hayes, Michelle; Keays, Richard T; Beveridge, Iain; Davies, Gary",Braz J Infect Dis,26,29

We review different biomarkers to systematically analyzed these values to evaluate whether are they are correlated with the severity of COVID-19 disease and so their ability to be a predictor for progression. METHODS: The current meta-analysis was carried out to identify relevant articles using eight different databases regarding the values of biomarkers and risk factors of significance that predict progression of mild or moderate cases into severe and critical cases. We defined the eligibility criteria using a PICO model. RESULTS: Twenty-two relevant articles were selected for meta-analysis the following biomarkers C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, LDH, neutrophil, %PD-1 expression, D-dimer, creatinine, AST and Cortisol all recorded high cut-off values linked to severe and critical cases while low lymphocyte count, and low Albumin level were recorded. Also, we meta- analyzed age and comorbidities as a risk factors of progression as hypertension, Diabetes and chronic obstructive lung diseases which significantly correlated with cases progression (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Ë The current meta-analysis is the first step for analysing and getting cut-off references values of significance for prediction COVID-19 case progression. More studies are needed on patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and on a larger scale to establish clearer threshold values that predict progression from mild to severe cases.

A higher mortality rate has been described in older infected individuals. Patients with hip fracture are a particularly vulnerable population during this pandemic because older age is associated with a higher mortality rate. Our aim was to describe the early mortality rate and demographic variables in a hip fracture sample population in Spain during the coronavirus pandemic. METHODS: This is a multicenter, observational, retrospective, descriptive study. We collected data from 13 major hospitals in Spain from the beginning of the national state of alarm (declared on March 14, 2020, by the Spanish government) until the end of our study period on April 4, 2020. All patients who were &#8805;65 years of age, presented to the Emergency Department of the participating hospitals during this period with a diagnosis of proximal femoral fracture, and had a minimum follow-up of 10 days were included in the cohort. In addition to mortality, demographic and other potential prognostic variables were also collected. RESULTS: In this study, 136 patients with a hip fracture were included. Of these patients, 124 underwent a surgical procedure and 12 were managed nonoperatively. The total mortality rate was 9.6%. Sixty-two patients were tested for COVID-19, with 23 patients being positive. The mortality rate for these 23 patients was 30.4% (7 of 23 patients) at a mean follow-up of 14 days. The mortality rate was 10.3% (4 of 39) for patients who had been tested and had a negative result and 2.7% (2 of 74) for patients who had not been tested. Of the 12 patients who were managed nonoperatively, 8 (67%) died, whereas, of the 124 patients who were surgically treated, 5 (4%) died. Results differed among centers.

Methods: We extracted relative search volumes from Google TrendsÔ (January 2015 to May 2020) for keywords related to the 4 procedure categories of male infertility, erectile dysfunction, Peyronie's disease and vasectomy. The most popular keywords in each category were used to assess immediate (30 days preceding and following official recommendation from Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on March 18, 2020) and long-term (January 1, 2015 to March 18, 2020 vs March 19, 2020 to May 21, 2020) shifts in public interest. Lastly, we assessed geographical variations in public interest during the phase I reopening period from April 24 to May 31, 2020. Results: There was an immediate reduction in interest across all 4 categories following the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recommendation. Long-term post-announcement relative search volume was lower than pre-announcement relative search volume in all categories as well, namely male infertility (54.33% vs 68.74%, p¼0.02), erectile dysfunction (45.00% vs 76.74%, p &lt;0.0001), Peyronie's disease (48.33% vs 77.95%, p &lt;0.0001) and vasectomy (51.33% vs 66.73%, p¼0.0005). During the phase I reopening period the relative search volume for vasectomy was higher in states that reopened early than in states that reopened late (60.29% vs 50.52%, p¼0.029). Conclusions: Public interest in elective urological procedures decreased following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and recommendations from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Interest rebounded in May, seemingly driven by states that lifted their stay-at-home order earlier than others.","Bhambhvani, H. P.; Tijerina, J. D.; Parham, M. J.; Greenberg, D. R.; Eisenberg, M.

Objective: To evaluate the performance of rapid IgM-IgG combined antibody tests in COVID-19 occupational surveillance in a group of Colombian enterprises. Materials and methods: We used the occupational surveillance data from companies that had performed periodic serological tests on all personnel from the end of April to the beginning of July, 2020. Workers were organized in small groups (""social bubbles"") to prevent outbreaks and optimize surveillance. The sensitivity was estimated as if the sampling had a prospective design. We describe here the changes in serological testing through periodic rounds. Results: Data were obtained from 4,740 workers, of whom only 23 were symptomatic showing changes from IgM(-)/IgG(-) to IgM(+) and then to IgM(+)/IgG(+) and IgG(+). The sensitivity was 40.94% for IgM(+) and 47.95% for IgM(+)/IgG(+). This implies that a little less than half of the cases can be detected. Conclusion: Antibody rapid tests have a role in the diagnostic process of infection and they must be evaluated taking into account the moment of the epidemic, the type of test purchased, and the populations at risk since their results depend on the number of infections and cases. In the context of a health crisis, they can be optimized by organizing workers into ""social bubbles""","Idrovo, Álvaro J; Moreno-Montoya, José; Pinzón-Flórez, Carlos E",Biomedica,26,6

In this study, using either live SARS-CoV-2 particles or retroviruses pseudotyped with the SARS-CoV-2 S viral surface protein (Spike), we studied the neutralizing antibody (nAb) response in serum samples from a cohort of 140 SARS-CoV-2 qPCR-confirmed infections, including patients with mild symptoms and also more severe forms, including those that required intensive care. We show that nAb titers correlated strongly with disease severity and with anti-spike IgG levels. Indeed, patients from intensive care units exhibited high nAb titers; conversely, patients with milder disease symptoms had heterogeneous nAb titers, and asymptomatic or exclusive outpatient-care patients had no or low nAbs. We found that nAb activity in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients displayed a relatively rapid decline after recovery compared to individuals infected with other coronaviruses. Moreover, we found an absence of cross-neutralization between endemic coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2, indicating that previous infection by human coronaviruses may not generate protective nAbs against SARS-CoV-2. Finally, we found that the D614G mutation in the spike protein, which has recently been identified as the current major variant in Europe, does not allow neutralization escape. Altogether, our results contribute to our understanding of the immune correlates of SARS-CoV-2-induced disease, and rapid evaluation of the role of the humoral response in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 is warranted.","Legros, Vincent; Denolly, Solène; Vogrig, Manon; Boson, Bertrand; Siret, Eglantine; Rigaill, Josselin; Pillet, Sylvie; Grattard, Florence; Gonzalo, Sylvie; Verhoeven, Paul; Allatif, Omran; Berthelot, Philippe; Pélissier, Carole; Thiery, Guillaume; Botelho-Nevers, Elisabeth; Millet, Guillaume; Morel, Jérôme; Paul, Stéphane; Walzer, Thierry; Cosset, François-Loïc; Bourlet, Thomas; Pozzetto, Bruno",Cell Mol Immunol,26,16

However, there seem to be no significant differences between individuals after the pandemic announcement, which provides evidence that COVID-19 is affecting individuals regardless of their extraversion trait disposition.

We study the change in both quantities over time, demonstrating a close similarity in the evolution of cases and deaths. The changing number of clusters of the case counts precedes that of the death counts by 32 days. On the other hand, there is an optimal offset of 16 days with respect to the greatest consistency between cluster groupings, determined by a new method of comparing affinity matrices. With this offset in mind, we identify anomalous countries in the progression from COVID-19 cases to deaths.

In contrast to some other countries in the region, Ethiopia never went into a full lockdown severely restricting movement. Despite subjective income measures suggesting a large proportion of households have been exposed to job loss or reduced incomes, we find that relative to a survey conducted in August and September of 2019, food consumption and household dietary diversity are largely unchanged or slightly increased by August 2020. We find some changes in the composition of food consumption, but they are not related to shocks found in previous phone surveys conducted with the same households. The results therefore suggest the types of subjective questions about income typically being asked in COVID-19 phone surveys may not appropriately reflect the magnitude of such shocks. They also imply, at least indirectly, that in the aggregate food value chains have been resilient to the shock associated with the pandemic.","Kalle, Hirvonen Brauw A. de Abate G.

Efforts have been taken to minimize the impact through strict screening measures in country borders in order to isolate potential virus carriers. Effective fast-screening methods are thus needed to identify infected individuals. The standard diagnostic methods for screening SARS-CoV-2 virus have always been to perform nucleic acid-based and serological tests. However, with each having drawbacks on producing false results at very early or later stage after symptoms onset, supplementary techniques are needed to back up these tests. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) as a detection technique has continuously advanced throughout the years in terms of sensitivity and capability to detect ultralow concentration of analytes ranging from single molecule to pathogens, to present as a highly potential alternative to known sensing methods. SERS technology as a candidate for an alternative and supplementary diagnostic method for the viral envelope of SARS-CoV-2 virus is presented, comparing its pros and cons to the standard methods and what other aspects it could offer that the other methods are not capable of. Factors that contribute to the detection effectivity of SERS is also discussed to show the advantages and limitations of this technique.

Social workers are working at the front lines responding to the current COVID-19 pandemic in a variety of health care practice settings, including nursing homes, however it is unclear how social workers perceive their preparedness during this time. METHODS: This study employed a cross-sectional survey to nursing home social workers via social media on feelings of preparedness for COVID-19, what has been most professionally helpful for social workers during these times in their role in COVID-19, as well as demographic questions. Demographic data were analyzed using SPSS and qualitative data were analyzed using the rigorous and accelerated data reduction (RADaR) technique. RESULTS: Data are based on a sample of 63 (N=63) nursing home social workers. Findings revealed that while some social workers felt prepared for the coronavirus, many respondents stated that they were unprepared to meet the demands and challenges they were facing. Moreover, participants shared that professional support was critically important to get through COVID-19. DISCUSSION: These findings are important, as social workers are tasked with ensuring each resident attains their highest level of psychosocial well-being, which can be achieved only when nursing home staff are supported.

Thus, patients awaiting a SOT or HSCT face the dilemma of choosing between a life-saving treatment that presents a significant threat of COVID-19 and the risk of waitlist dropout, progression of disease, or mortality. The lack of established literature on COVID-19 complicates the issue as patients, particularly those with inadequate health literacy, may not have the resources needed to navigate these decisions. MATERIAL AND METHODS We conducted a standardized phone survey of patients awaiting SOT or HSCT to assess the prevalence of inadequate health literacy and attitudes toward transplant during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS Seventy-one patients completed the survey, with a response rate of 84.5%. Regardless of health literacy, most waitlisted candidates recognized that the current pandemic is a serious situation affecting their care and that COVID-19 poses a significant risk to their health. Despite the increased risks, most patients reported they would choose immediate transplantation if there was no foreseeable end to the pandemic, and especially if the medical urgency did not permit further delay. There were no differences in responses across the patient waitlist groups for heart, kidney, liver, and stem cell transplant. CONCLUSIONS These findings can help transplant centers decide how transplantation services should proceed during this pandemic and can be used to educate patients and guide discussions about informed consent for transplant during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Tan, Ek Khoon; Koh, Ye Xin; Kee, Terence; Juhari, Juhainah Binte; Tan, Teing Ee; Sim, David Kheng Leng; Ho, Aloysius Yew Leng; Krishnan, Lalitha; Tee, Ping Sing; Krishnamoorthy, Thinesh Lee; Goh, Brian Kim Poh; Tan, Ban Hock; Chung, Shimin Jasmine; Phua, Ghee Chee; Jeyaraj, Prema Raj",Ann Transplant,26,20

Purpose: The present study aimed to determine the influence of preoperative nutritional status on the postoperative outcomes of pediatric patients who underwent elective gastrointestinal (GI) surgery. Methods: This prospective observational study was conducted at Cairo University Specialized Pediatric Hospital. According to the designated inclusion criteria, 75 surgical cases of both sexes were included. A structured questionnaire was developed and administered. This questionnaire included three main sections: demographic data and nutritional status parameters at admission and discharge. Pre- and postoperative nutritional statuses were compared. Results: According to both the Subjective Global Nutritional Assessment and STRONGKIDS score Questioner, more than 60% of patients in the upper GI patient group were at risk of malnutrition. Wasting status was most common in the upper GI patient group (67%; versus 39.1% in the lower GI group). Underweight status was more common in the hepatobiliary and upper GI patient groups (nearly 50% for each group) than in the lower GI group (30.4%). On the other hand, stunted patients had a higher incidence of complications and a prolonged hospital stay (P = 0.003 and P = 0.037, respectively), while underweight lower GI patients experienced a prolonged hospital stay (P = 0.02).

We use data from a nationally representative sample of the United States from the Understanding Coronavirus in America tracking survey to understand gender differences within households on the impact of the COVID-19 crisis. We study how fathers and mothers are coping with this crisis in terms of childcare provision, employment, working arrangements, and psychological distress levels. We find that women have carried a heavier load than men in the provision of childcare during the COVID-19 crisis, even while still working. Mothers' current working situations appear to have a limited influence on their provision of childcare. This division of childcare is, however, associated with a reduction in working hours and an increased probability of transitioning out of employment for working mothers. Finally, we observe a small but new gap in psychological distress that emerged between mothers and women without school-age children in the household in early April. This new gap appears to be driven by higher levels of psychological distress reported by mothers of elementary school-age and younger children.","Zamarro, Gema; Prados, María J",Rev Econ Househ,26,16

This study presents the first investigation on the dynamics of bacterial and fungal necromass of municipal sludge in non-aeration versus alternating aeration landfill bioreactors by using amino sugar biomarkers. Results showed that under non-aeration treatment, the decomposition rate of muramic acid derived from bacteria is higher than that of fungal-derived glucosamine. The relative change in glucosamine and muramic acid in the early period of landfills under the alternating aeration treatment is consistent with that under non-aeration treatment. However, with the increase in alternating aeration cycles, bacterial necromass muramic acid exerts a lower decomposition rate than fungal necromass glucosamine. Throughout the entire landfill period, galactosamine is the amino sugar with the slowest decomposition rate under non-aeration mode but the amino sugar with the fastest decomposition rate under alternating aeration mode. The present work fills the knowledge gap of microbial necromass dynamics of municipal solid waste in landfills.","Tan, Wenbing; Wang, Shuhan; Liu, Niankai; Xi, Beidou",Sci Total Environ,26,4

METHODS: This retrospective study included consecutive symptomatic patients who underwent chest CT and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from March 2020 to May 2020 for suspected COVID-19. Twelve readers with different levels of expertise independently scored each CT using the CO-RADS scheme for detecting pulmonary involvement by COVID-19. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were computed to investigate diagnostic yield. Fleiss' kappa statistics was used to evaluate interreader agreement. RESULTS: A total of 572 patients (mean age, 63 ± 20 [standard deviation]; 329 men; 142 patients with COVID-19 and 430 patients without COVID-19) were evaluated. There was a moderate agreement for CO-RADS rating among all readers (Fleiss' K = 0.43 [95% CI 0.42-0.44]) with a substantial agreement for CO-RADS 1 category (Fleiss' K = 0.61 [95% CI 0.60-0.62]) and moderate agreement for CO-RADS 5 category (Fleiss' K = 0.60 [95% CI 0.58-0.61]).

To address these challenges, many digital tools are being explored and developed to contain the spread of the disease. With the lack of availability of vaccines, there is an urgent need to avert resurgence of infections by putting some measures, such as contact tracing, in place. While digital tools, such as phone applications are advantageous, they also pose challenges and have limitations (eg, wireless coverage could be an issue in some cases). On the other hand, wearable devices, when coupled with the Internet of Things (IoT), are expected to influence lifestyle and healthcare directly, and they may be useful for health monitoring during the global pandemic and beyond. In this work, we conduct a literature review of contact tracing methods and applications. Based on the literature review, we found limitations in gathering health data, such as insufficient network coverage. To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel intelligent tool that will be useful for contact tracing and prediction of COVID-19 clusters. The solution comprises a phone application combined with a wearable device, infused with unique intelligent IoT features (complex data analysis and intelligent data visualization) embedded within the system to aid in COVID-19 analysis. Contact tracing applications must establish data collection and data interpretation. Intelligent data interpretation can assist epidemiological scientists in anticipating clusters, and can enable them to take necessary action in improving public health management.

As there is no definite antiviral treatment and effective vaccine, the only efficient means of protecting and mitigating infectious contagion has been the use of personal protective equipment, especially by healthcare workers. However, masks affect the humidification process of inhaled air, possibly leading to a basal inflammatory state of the upper airways. Study design: This is a single-center observational study conducted at the University Hospital of Catania from April 1, 2020, to June 31, 2020. Methods: We analyzed the role of protective masks on the elimination of upper airways complaints in healthcare workers of the University Hospital of Catania. We evaluated 277 subjects through a selfadministered 17 item questionnaire based on respiratory, work performance and health-related quality of life domains. Results: A higher prevalence of nasal and ocular symptoms, perceived reduced work performance, difficulty in concentrating, and sleep disorders were found. After two weeks adhering to a list of good practices that we recommended, significant reversibility of the symptoms investigated and work performance enhancement were observed. Conclusions: Despite clinical complaints related to personal protective equipment, effective amelioration through usage rules is easily obtained. Given the essential use of protective masks, healthcare workers have to adhere to appropriate work and safety prevention rules.","Maniaci, A; Ferlito, S; Bubbico, L; Ledda, C; Rapisarda, V; Iannella, G; La Mantia, I; Grillo, C; Vicini, C; Privitera, E; Coco, S; Cammaroto, G; Lechien, J R; Magliulo, G; Pace, A; Meccariello, G; Cocuzza, S",Ann. ig,26,24

The aim of this study was to develop a framework for assessing glaucoma progression using structural and functional indices jointly for a fixed specificity. METHODS: The study included 337 eyes of 207 patients with ocular hypertension or primary open-angle glaucoma selected from the Diagnostic Innovations in Glaucoma Study or the African Descent and Glaucoma Evaluation Study. All patients had at least 9 visits. Each visit had retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFLT) and mean sensitivity from static automated perimetry (SAP MS) measured within a one-month window. Simple linear regression was applied to assess deterioration in each index for series of 5 to 9 visits. To identify progression using the two indices jointly, marginal significance levels set at a specificity of 95% were derived for two criteria: ANY (worsening on either RNFLT or SAP MS) and ALL (worsening on both RNFLT and SAP MS). Positive rate (percentage of eyes flagged as progressing) was determined individually for each index, as well as for the ANY and ALL criteria. RESULTS: Compared to SAP MS, RNFLT had higher positive rates (15% to 45%) for all series lengths. For the joint analyses, the positive rate was on average 12% higher for the ANY criterion compared to the ALL criterion. While RNFLT-alone had comparable positive rates and time-to-detection as the ANY criterion, each uniquely identified a subset of eyes (Kappa = 0.55 to 0.75). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a simple framework for assessing glaucoma progression with data from two tests jointly, without compromising specificity. This framework can be extended to include two or more parameters, can accommodate global or regional indices, and can eventually be used with novel parameters identified as predictive of glaucoma progression.","Abu, Sampson Listowell; Marín-Franch, Iván; Racette, Lyne",PLoS One,26,1

We developed the SIRDV-Virulence epidemiological model based on a population balance equation to study the effect of mutants of the virus and the effect of vaccination strategies on mitigating the transmission among the population in the United States. Based on the available data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), we obtain the key parameters governing the dynamic evolution of the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the context studied, the results show that a large fraction of infected cases comes from the adult and children populations in the presence of a mutant variant of COVID-19 with high infection rates. We further investigate the optimum vaccine distribution strategy among different age groups. Given the current situation in the United States, the results show that prioritizing children and adult vaccinations over that of seniors can contain the spread of the active cases, thereby preventing the healthcare system from being overwhelmed and minimizing subsequent deaths. The model suggests that the only option to curb the effects of this pandemic is to reduce the population of unvaccinated individuals. A higher fraction of Anti/Non-vaxxers can lead to the resurgence of the pandemic. Author summaryThe changing dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic are primarily due to the mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It is often seen that these mutants not only have a higher infection rate but also evade the presently administered vaccines. To consider the fact that different age population groups are affected to varied extent by these mutants, we build a mathematical model to account for the inter-transfer infection among age groups, which can predict the overall COVID-19 transmission in the United States. The parameter quantification of our mathematical model is based on the public data for infected cases, deaths and vaccinated from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Additionally, our study shows that the vaccine distribution strategies should be developed with a priority given to the most infected age groups in order to curb the total infected and death cases. We also show how the Anti/Non-vaxxers can be a potential reason for resurgence of the pandemic. These results are of immediate practical application in determining future vaccine distribution regarding to the pandemic and ensuring the health care system is ready to deal with the worst-case scenario with a very high infection rate.","Roy, Jyotirmoy; Heath, Samuel; Ramkrishna, Doraiswami; Wang, Shiyan",,26,1

We aimed to describe the clinical presentation of COVID-19 among frail and nonfrail older hospitalised patients and to evaluate the potential association between frailty and clinical course, decision of treatment level with outcomes change in functional capacity and survival. METHODS: We performed a multi-center, retrospective cross-sectional cohort study examining data on clinical presentation and frailty-related domains for hospitalised people aged 75 + years with a positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) test. Frailty was assessed at admission using record-based MPI (rMPI) and Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS). Decision on treatment level about invasive ventilation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), change in CFS-score from admission to discharge, changed need of home care, and in-hospital, 30-day and 90-day mortality were registered. RESULTS: 100 patients (median age 82 years (IQR 78-86), 56% female) with COVID-19 were included. 54 patients were assessed moderately or severely frail (rMPI-score = 2 or 3) and compared to non-frail (rMPI-score = 1). At admission, frail patients presented more frequently with confusion. At discharge, functional decline measured by change in CFS and increased home care was more prevalent among frail than the non-frail. Decisions about no invasive ventilation or CPR were more prevalent among frail older patients with COVID-19 than non-frail. Ninety-day mortality was 70% among frail patients versus 15% in non-frail. CONCLUSION: Frailty seems to be associated with confusion, more frequent decisions about treatment level, larger functional decline at discharge and a higher mortality rate among older patients with COVID-19.","Verholt, Ane Borgbjerg; Gregersen, Merete; Gonzalez-Bofill, Nuria; Hansen, Troels K; Ebdrup, Lotte; Foss, Catherine H; Lietzen, Lone Winther",,26,3

As part of that process, this study aimed to understand the public perceptions regarding a future COVID-19 vaccine in Australia. METHODS: A national cross-sectional online survey of 1420 Australian adults (18 years and older) was undertaken between 18 and 24 March 2020. The statistical analysis of the data included univariate and multivariable logistic regression model analysis. RESULTS: Respondents generally held positive views towards vaccination. Eighty percent (n = 1143) agreed with the statement that getting myself vaccinated for COVID-19 would be a good way to protect myself against infection. Females (n = 614, 83%) were more likely to agree with the statement than males (n = 529, 78%) (aOR = 1.4 (95% CI: 1.1-1.8); P = 0.03), while 91% of those aged 70 years and above agreed compared to 76% of 18-29-year-olds (aOR = 2.3 (95% CI:1.2-4.1); P = 0.008). Agreement was also higher for those with a self-reported chronic disease (aOR = 1.4 (95% CI: 1.1-2.0); P = 0.04) and among those who held private health insurance (aOR = 1.7 (95% CI: 1.3-2.3); P < 0.001). Beyond individual perceptions, 78% stated that their decision to vaccinate would be supported by family and friends. CONCLUSION: This study presents an early indication of public perceptions towards a future COVID-19 vaccine and represents a starting point for mapping vaccine perceptions. To support an effective launch of these new vaccines, governments need to use this time to understand the communities concerns and to identify the strategies that will support engagement.","Seale, Holly; Heywood, Anita E; Leask, Julie; Sheel, Meru; Durrheim, David N; Bolsewicz, Katarzyna; Kaur, Rajneesh",BMC Infect Dis,26,24

The framework is based on the Tactical Urbanism (TU) practices and involves the use of Mobile Urban Elements (MUE) in uncertain and potentially confusing conditions (e.g., the COVID‐19 context). The methodology includes the application of the Four‐Phase Model (problem and ideation;development;implementation, testing and assessment;final pro-posal) and a quantitative and qualitative assessment. The proposed assessment criteria were developed through an evaluation according to three aspects: (1) feasibility impact;(2) social impact;and (3) spatial impact. The methodology was applied to Furnish, an urban design project based on a ULL and prototyping, which was recently developed in five European cities. The empirical results, obtained using the impact analysis, indicate that the prototypes developed in the project are trans-ferable to other cities and generate social interaction in public spaces. The applied research showed that the Four‐Phase Model may be used as a new and improved iterative design process: the LOOP Scheme. The application of this assessment methodology to ULLs may provide valuable information for the future planning of urban interventions in public spaces. © 2021 by the authors.

These attributes are complementary to the expansion of SARS-CoV-2 serologic testing, which may be used to inform community seroprevalence rates. METHODS: The Luminex xMAP SARS-CoV-2 Multi-Antigen assay utilizes magnetic beads labeled with three viral antigens (nucleocapsid [NC], receptor binding domain [RBD], spike S1 subunit) to detect anti-viral IgG-class antibodies, and has Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for use in serum and plasma. This assay was modified for use with DBS and validated against paired sera tested by one of two reference assays: the Roche Diagnostics Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 ECLIA or the Euroimmun anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA. RESULTS: 159 paired DBS and serum specimens analyzed using the modified Luminex xMAP assay on DBS and the reference methods on serum showed an overall concordance of 96.9% (154/159). Use of multivariate pattern recognition software (CLIR) for post-analytical interpretation of the Luminex xMAP DBS assay results, instead of manufacturer provided interpretive thresholds, increased overall qualitative result concordance to 99.4% (158/159) between the modified Luminex xMAP DBS and reference results. CONCLUSIONS: Use of DBS for detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 provides comparable results to those obtained using serum. DBS concordance was improved with multivariate pattern recognition software (CLIR). We demonstrate that DBS are a reliable specimen type for SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection using the modified Luminex xMAP assay.","Turgeon, Coleman T; Sanders, Karen A; Rinaldo, Piero; Granger, Dane; Hilgart, Heather; Matern, Dietrich; Theel, Elitza S",PLoS One,26,29

It is important to understand youth attitudes toward and experience of virtual services. OBJECTIVE: This study examined the attitudes toward and experiences of virtual mental health and substance use services among youth drawn from clinical and non-clinical samples. METHOD: Four hundred nine youth completed a survey including questions about their attitudes toward and experience of virtual services. The survey included quantitative and open-ended questions on virtual care, as well as a mental health and substance use screener. RESULTS: The majority of youth with mental health or substance use challenges would be willing to consider individual virtual services, but fewer would consider group virtual services. However, many have not received virtual services. Youth are interested in accessing a wide variety of virtual services and other supportive wellness services. Advantages and disadvantages of virtual services are discussed, including accessibility benefits and technological barriers. DISCUSSION: As youth mental health and substance use services have rapidly gone virtual during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is essential that we hear the perspectives of youth to promote service utilization among those in need. Diverse, accessible, technologically stable virtual services are required to meet the needs of different youth, possibly with in-person options for some youth. Future research, engaging youth in the research process, is needed to evaluate the efficacy of virtual services to plan for the sustainability of some virtual service gains beyond the pandemic period.","Hawke, Lisa D; Sheikhan, Natasha Y; MacCon, Karen; Henderson, Joanna",BMC Health Serv Res,26,24

PURPOSE: To evaluate racial/ethnic disparities in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection rates and COVID-19 outcomes, factors contributing to disparities, and interventions to reduce them. (PROSPERO: CRD42020187078). DATA SOURCES: English-language articles in MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus, searched from inception through 31 August 2020. Gray literature sources were searched through 2 November 2020. STUDY SELECTION: Observational studies examining SARS-CoV-2 infections, hospitalizations, or deaths by race/ethnicity in U.S. settings. DATA EXTRACTION: Single-reviewer abstraction confirmed by a second reviewer; independent dual-reviewer assessment of quality and strength of evidence. DATA SYNTHESIS: 37 mostly fair-quality cohort and cross-sectional studies, 15 mostly good-quality ecological studies, and data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and APM Research Lab were included. African American/Black and Hispanic populations experience disproportionately higher rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalization, and COVID-19-related mortality compared with non-Hispanic White populations, but not higher case-fatality rates (mostly reported as in-hospital mortality) (moderate- to high-strength evidence). Asian populations experience similar outcomes to non-Hispanic White populations (low-strength evidence). Outcomes for other racial/ethnic groups have been insufficiently studied. Health care access and exposure factors may underlie the observed disparities more than susceptibility due to comorbid conditions (low-strength evidence). LIMITATIONS: Selection bias, missing race/ethnicity data, and incomplete outcome assessments in cohort and cross-sectional studies must be considered. In addition, adjustment for key demographic covariates was lacking in ecological studies. CONCLUSION: African American/Black and Hispanic populations experience disproportionately higher rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related mortality but similar rates of case fatality. Differences in health care access and exposure risk may be driving higher infection and mortality rates.

The present study aims to investigate the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms, and behavioral aspects amidst the COVID-19 pandemic in a Brazilian population. An online survey was administered from May 22 to June 5, 2020 using a questionnaire comprising of sociodemographic information, the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21), and the Coping Strategies Inventory. Participants comprised 3,000 people from Brazil's 26 states and the Federal District, with an average age of 39.8 years, women (83%), married (50.6%), graduates (70.1%) and employees (46.7%).

Since that day, Spaniards have faced the situation of confinement in their homes, while sanitary containment measures have restricted mobility, reducing economic and social activity, in addition to paralyzing productive work in numerous sectors. In these circumstances the scope of which cannot be predicted in all its consequences and dimensions as of now, one of the most affected social sectors has been the population of children, adolescents and young people. At this point, this sector has been affected in its educational work, as well as in leisure time activities, having been deprived of the social interactions necessary for the process of socialization and formation of personality. Based on the aforementioned situation, when an important record was detected on the levels of stress, anxiety and behavioral problems, it was seen fit to implement Mindfulness and Music Education sessions online, with the main objective of channeling the problems of behavior, stress and anxiety generated by confinement through an online methodology. The dynamics was studied with primary school students in Madrid. In order to evaluate the impact of this interventional action, a quasi-experimental design was structured from the methodological point of view, establishing the application of Mindfulness and Online Music Education sessions as an independent variable, and changes as a dependent variable, behavior, stress and anxiety. Next, an incidental non-probabilistic sampling was established, with a total of 130 participants (77% girls and 23% boys), with the mean age of the children of 9.407 (DT = 2.393), 100% of whom were Primary Education students. The following social networks were used as tools for communication and socio-digital interaction: WhatsApp, Zoom and Instagram, in order to implement the exercises used in the MindfulnessBased Stress Reduction (MBSR) program by Kabat-Zinn (1979) of the activities of the Musical Education area corresponding to Primary Education, while for data collection an adaptation of the questionnaire “Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire” (FFMQ) by Baer et al. (2006), as well as the JASP 0.13.1 application, SPSS and an excel spreadsheet for processing. Regarding the results and the main objectives, the attempt was made to channel the level of stress and anxiety among the participants, in terms of behavioral problems, achieving a partial reduction. In this way, and based on inferential statistics, the presence of a strong positive linear correlation between age, conceived as a quantitative ratio variable, and online sessions, as the independent variable is deduced, resulting in 0.979. As a recommendation for future work, a larger sample must be taken in order to establish more general results, reinforce the guidelines dictated to teachers both to carry out Mindfulness and Music Education activities online and establish criteria for inclusion and exclusion. © 2021 Ufa State Institute of Arts.

The health system in Aotearoa New Zealand has fared better than many other regions, with the country being successful, so far, in avoiding sustained community transmission. However, there was a significant initial disruption to services across the cancer continuum, resulting in a decrease in the number of new diagnoses of cancer in March and April 2020. Te Aho o Te Kahu, Aotearoa New Zealand's national Cancer Control Agency, coordinated a nationwide response to minimise the impact of COVID-19 on people with cancer. The response, outlined in this paper, included rapid clinical governance, a strong equity focus, development of national clinical guidance, utilising new ways of delivering care, identifying and addressing systems issues and close monitoring and reporting of the impact on cancer services. Diagnostic procedures and new cancer registrations increased in the months following the national lockdown, and the cumulative number of cancer registrations in 2020 surpassed the number of registrations in 2019 by the end of September. Cancer treatment services – surgery, medical oncology, radiation oncology and haematology – continued during the national COVID-19 lockdown in March and April 2020 and continued to be delivered at pre-COVID-19 volumes in the months since.

Each healthcare center has been compelled to adapt the treatment guidelines established by the different scientific societies. OBJECTIVES: Analyze the impact of the methodology based on simulation as a tool to improve our clinical practice: work dynamics, effectiveness and safety of all the physicians involved in the management of labor in COVID pregnant women and its usefulness to facilitate the adaptation of protocols to a specific clinical context. METHOD: Descriptive observational study that includes the C-sections and deliveries of COVID pregnant women performed in our hospital. The actions carried out in each procedure were analyzed using the simulation multidisciplinary briefing and debriefing tools, before and after each case. RESULTS: A total of 5 clinical cases were analyzed. Difficulties were found in the execution of the protocols established for the care of the COVID pregnant. Organizational, structural, material resources and human factors obstacles were the most common. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that the analysis example using simulation methodology was a tool of great value in three aspects: teamwork improvement, actions consent and improvement proposals for the adaptation and implementation of protocols.","González, A M; Hernández Pinto, P; Maldonado, S; Villalobos, I; Sierra, N; Melgosa, I",Rev Esp Anestesiol Reanim,26,30

There have been significant problems with leaders and citizenry deliberately ignoring and not complying with such measures and which have directly resulted in sudden rises in infection numbers. Here, I show the nature and extent of the widespread problem and argue that the problem is in large part due to our modern society characterised by liberal individualism. I apply the philosophy proposed by philosopher Alasdair MacIntrye to show that one key underlying cause of the non-compliant behaviour of citizenry is due to modern liberal individualism that has deprived the modern nation state of the opportunities and authority for it to teach or to dictate what is the common good of the society as a whole to individuals in its community. This is the first time MacIntyre's philosophy has been applied to public health, and this paper demonstrates the need for ethics education to counter-balance liberal individualism in order to contain and to prevent another pandemic and public health crisis in modern society.","Lim, Hannah YeeFen",Asian Bioeth Rev,26,16

Methods: Mongolian medicine with anti-inflammatory and antiviral effects is selected from Mongolian medicine prescription preparations. TCMSP, ETCM database and document mining methods were used to collect active compounds. Swiss TargetPrediction and SuperPred server were used to find targets of compounds with smiles number. Drugbank and Genecard database were used to collect antiviral drug targets. Then the above targets were compared and analyzed to screen out antiviral targets of Mongolia medicine. Metascape database platform was used to enrich and analyze the GO (Gene ontology) annotation and KEGG pathway of the targets. In view of the high homology of gene sequences between SARS-CoV-2 S-protein RBD domain and SARS virus, as well as their similarities in pathogenesis and clinical manifestations, we established SARS-CoV-2 S-protein model using Swiss-Model. The ZDOCK protein docking software was applied to dock the S-protein with the human angiotensin ACE2 protein to find out the key amino acids of the binding site. Taking ACE2 as the receptor, the molecular docking between the active ingredients and the target protein was studied by AutoDock molecular docking software. The interaction between ligand and receptor is applied to provide a choice for screening anti-COVID-19 drugs. Results: A total of 253 active components were predicted. Metascape analysis showed that key candidate targets were significantly enriched in multiple pathways related to different toxins. These key candidate targets were mainly derived from phillyrin and chlorogenic acid. Through the protein docking between S-protein and ACE2, it is found that Glu329/Gln325 and Gln42/Asp38 in ACE2 play an important role in the binding process of the two. The results of molecular docking virtual calculation showed that phillyrin and chlorogenic acid could stably combine with Gln325 and Gln42/Asp38 in ACE2, respectively, which hindered the combination between S- protein and ACE2. Conclusion: Phillyrin and chlorogenic acid can effectively prevent the combination of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein and ACE2 at the molecular level. Phillyrin and chlorogenic acid can be used as potential inhibitors of COVID-19 for further research and development.","Yu, Jiu-Wang; Wang, Lu; Bao, Li-Dao",J Funct Foods,26,1

Beside the specific pathogenic effect of SARS-CoV-2, incompletely understood deleterious and aberrant host immune responses play critical roles in severe disease. Our objective was to summarise the available information on the pathophysiology of COVID-19. METHODS: Two reviewers independently identified eligible studies according to the following PICO framework: P (population): patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection; I (intervention): any intervention/no intervention; C (comparator): any comparator; O (outcome) any clinical or serological outcome including but not limited to immune cell phenotype and function and serum cytokine concentration. RESULTS: Of the 55 496 records yielded, 84 articles were eligible for inclusion according to question-specific research criteria. Proinflammatory cytokine expression, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), was increased, especially in severe COVID-19, although not as high as other states with severe systemic inflammation. The myeloid and lymphoid compartments were differentially affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection depending on disease phenotype. Failure to maintain high interferon (IFN) levels was characteristic of severe forms of COVID-19 and could be related to loss-of-function mutations in the IFN pathway and/or the presence of anti-IFN antibodies. Antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection showed a high variability across individuals and disease spectrum. Multiparametric algorithms showed variable diagnostic performances in predicting survival, hospitalisation, disease progression or severity, and mortality. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection affects both humoral and cellular immunity depending on both disease severity and individual parameters. This systematic literature review informed the EULAR 'points to consider' on COVID-19 pathophysiology and immunomodulatory therapies.","Najm, Aurélie; Alunno, Alessia; Mariette, Xavier; Terrier, Benjamin; De Marco, Gabriele; Emmel, Jenny; Mason, Laura; McGonagle, Dennis G; Machado, Pedro M",,26,1

Teaching was modified iteratively in response to feedback. Our experience shows that virtual teaching, while not a replacement for in-person engagement, can be a valuable tool both to supplement partnership activities when travel is not possible, and to enhance global health partnerships long term. This approach can also inform the transition of other forms of medical education to the virtual space.","Bryan, Jennifer M; Beyene, Temesgen; Kebede, Sofia; Kaufman, Adam; Jiru, Tilahun; Maskalyk, James; Landes, Megan; McKnight, Alexandra; Fremes, Elayna; Cheung, Eileen",CJEM,26,16

Prior studies have raised concerns about patients' ability to form antibodies in response to various antigens, especially SARS-CoV-2. The objective of this study is to determine whether OCR attenuates the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 in patients with MS as compared with other disease modifying therapies. METHODS: This is a case-control study looking at the odds of developing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in patients treated with OCR versus other disease modifying therapies. From May 13, 2020 through March 1, 2021, patients with a RT-PCR-confirmed infection to SARS-CoV-2 were tested for presence of antibodies and the data was recorded. Outpatients with MS at the Methodist Hospitals Comprehensive MS Center were selected who had a prior infection with COVID-19 as demonstrated by RT-PCR in the electronic health records. Odds ratios were calculated to compare rates of antibody formation with OCR exposure vs other DMT. RESULTS: 24 patients had evidence of COVID-19 and had antibody testing available at the time of analysis. Patients who received OCR had decreased odds of forming antibodies (OR 0.045, p = 0.011, 95% CI (0.004,0.488)). CONCLUSIONS: Patients who received OCR within the prior 6 months of COVID-19 infection had decreased odds of developing antibodies as compared with other DMTs. This suggests that OCR may attenuate the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2. Additional studies should analyze the odds of spike protein antibody formation in response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines for patients on OCR.","Conte, William L",Mult Scler Relat Disord,26,16

Human mobility is at the epicenter of that change, as the greatest facilitator for the spread of the virus. To study the change in mobility, to evaluate the efficiency of mobility restriction policies, and to facilitate a better response to possible future crisis, we need to properly understand all mobility data sources at our disposal. Our work is dedicated to the study of private mobility sources, gathered and released by large technological companies. This data is of special interest because, unlike most public sources, it is focused on people, not transportation means. i.e., its unit of measurement is the closest thing to a person in a western society: a phone. Furthermore, the sample of society they cover is large and representative. On the other hand, this sort of data is not directly accessible for anonymity reasons. Thus, properly interpreting its patterns demands caution. Aware of that, we set forth to explore the behavior and inter-relations of private sources of mobility data in the context of Spain. This country represents a good experimental setting because of its large and fast pandemic peak, and for its implementation of a sustained, generalized lockdown.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We created SemRepDS (an extension of SemRep), capable of extracting semantic relations from abstracts by leveraging a DS-specific terminology (iDISK) containing 28,884 DS terms not found in the UMLS. PubMed abstracts were processed using SemRepDS to generate semantic relations, which were then filtered using a PubMedBERT-based model to remove incorrect relations before generating our knowledge graph (SuppKG). Two pathways are used to identify potential DS-Drug interactions which are then evaluated by medical professionals for mechanistic plausibility. RESULTS: Comparison analysis found that SemRepDS returned 206.9% more DS relations and 158.5% more DS entities than SemRep. The fine-tuned BERT model obtained an F1 score of 0.8605 and removed 43.86% of the relations, improving the precision of the relations by 26.4% compared to pre-filtering. SuppKG consists of 2,928 DS-specific nodes. Manual review of findings identified 44 (88%) proposed DS-Gene-Drug and 32 (64%) proposed DS-Gene1-Function-Gene2-Drug pathways to be mechanistically plausible. DISCUSSION: The additional relations extracted using SemRepDS generated SuppKG that was used to find plausible DSI not found in the current literature. By the nature of the SuppKG, these interactions are unlikely to have been found using SemRep without the expanded DS terminology. CONCLUSION: We successfully extend SemRep to include DS information and produce SuppKG which can be used to find potential DS-Drug interactions.","Schutte, Dalton; Vasilakes, Jake; Bompelli, Anu; Zhou, Yuqi; Fiszman, Marcelo; Xu, Hua; Kilicoglu, Halil; Bishop, Jeffrey R.; Adam, Terrence; Zhang, Rui",,26,20

In the absence of a readily available medical treatment, any strategy to contain the virus in the US will depend on the behavioral response of US residents. In this paper, we study individual's perceptions on COVID-19 and social distancing during the week of March 10-16, 2020, a week when COVID-19 was officially declared to be a pandemic by WHO and when new infections in the US were more than doubling every three days. Using a nationally representative sample of 5,414 respondents 18+ years of age from the Understanding America Study (UAS), we find that perceptions about COVID-19 health risks and economic consequences in the US population were largely pessimistic and highly variable by age and education. US residents who are young and do not have a college degree perceived a lower risk of getting infected but a higher probability of running out of money than others. Most individuals reported taking some steps to distance themselves from others but important differences emerge by gender and by source of information on COVID-19. Using state and day fixed-effect regressions, we show that perceptions of the health risks closely followed the number of COVID-19 cases in the country, and perceptions of the economic consequences and the prevalence of social distancing were driven upwards by both national and state-level cases. Unless addressed by effective health communication that reaches individuals across all social strata, variations in perceptions about COVID-19 epidemic raise concerns about the ability of the US to implement and sustain the widespread and restrictive policies that are required to curtail the pandemic.","Ciancio, Alberto; Kämpfen, Fabrice; Kohler, Iliana V; Bennett, Daniel; Bruine de Bruin, Wändi; Darling, Jill; Kapteyn, Arie; Maurer, Jürgen; Kohler, Hans-Peter",PLoS One,26,13

However, when and whether LSD can be considered is subject to the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the recovery rate, and the case-fatality rate. It is imperative to provide real-time assessment of three factors to guide LSD. OBJECTIVE: A simple LSD index was developed for health decision makers to do real-time assessment of COVID-19 at the global, country, region, and community level. METHODS: Data on the retrospective cohort of 186 countries with three factors were retrieved from a publicly available repository from January to early July. A simple index for guiding LSD was measured by the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases and recoveries, and the case-fatality rate was envisaged. If the LSD index was less than 1, LSD can be considered. The dynamic changes of the COVID-19 pandemic were evaluated to assess whether and when health decision makers allowed for LSD and when to reimplement social distancing after resurgences of the epidemic. RESULTS: After large-scale outbreaks in a few countries before mid-March (prepandemic phase), the global weekly LSD index peaked at 4.27 in March and lasted until mid-June (pandemic phase), during which most countries were affected and needed to take various social distancing measures. Since, the value of LSD has gradually declined to 0.99 on July 5 (postpandemic phase), at which 64.7% (120/186) of countries and regions had an LSD<1 with the decile between 0 and 1 to refine risk stratification by countries. The LSD index decreased to 1 in about 115 days. In addition, we present the results of dynamic changes of the LSD index for the world and for each country and region with different time windows from January to July 5. The results of the LSD index on the resurgence of the COVID-19 epidemic in certain regions and validation by other emerging infectious diseases are presented. CONCLUSIONS: This simple LSD index provides a quantitative assessment of whether and when to ease or implement social distancing to provide advice for health decision makers and travelers.","Chen, Sam Li-Sheng; Yen, Amy Ming-Fang; Lai, Chao-Chih; Hsu, Chen-Yang; Chan, Chang-Chuan; Chen, Tony Hsiu-Hsi",J Med Internet Res,26,8

Rapid human-to-human transmission, even from asymptomatic individuals, has led to the quick spread of the virus worldwide, causing a wide range of clinical manifestations from cold-like symptoms to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiorgan injury, and even death. Therefore, using rapid and accurate diagnostic methods to identify the virus and subsequently select appropriate and effective treatments can help improvement of patients and control the pandemic. So far, various treatment regimens along with prophylactic vaccines have been developed to manage COVID-19-infected patients. Among these, antibody-based therapies, including neutralizing antibodies (against different parts of the virus), polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, plasma therapy, and high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) have shown promising outcomes in accelerating and improving the treatment process of patients, avoiding the viral spreading widely, and managing the pandemic.

We investigated the association between the C-reactive protein (CRP) to albumin ratio (CAR) and in-hospital mortality in patients with hypertensive COVID-19. A total of 176 patients with hypertension diagnosed with COVID-19 were included in this study. The CAR was compared between survivors and nonsurvivors. Logistic regression analysis was used to detect independent predictors of mortality due to COVID-19 in patients with hypertension. A cutoff value of CAR was obtained for predicting in-hospital death in patients with hypertensive COVID-19. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed for survival analysis in the study population. The CAR values were significantly higher in nonsurvivors than in survivors with hypertension. Moreover, the CAR was an independent predictor of in-hospital death in patients with hypertensive COVID-19, as shown in multivariable logistic regression analysis. Receiver operating characteristic analysis yielded a cutoff value of 20.75 for the CAR for predicting in-hospital death in patients with hypertension. Kaplan-Meier curve analysis showed that patients with hypertensive COVID-19 with a CAR value of &#8805;20.75 had a higher incidence of in-hospital death.

Universal testing on labor and delivery units has been implemented by many hospitals to ensure patient and staff safety. Asymptomatic carrier rates are expected to vary based on geographic differences in disease prevalence, although differences within the same city have not been reported previously. In addition, clinical follow-up of women who had a negative result for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 during obstetrical hospitalization has not been included in any previous reports. Objective: This study aimed to describe the prevalence of positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 test results among asymptomatic pregnant women at 2 Philadelphia obstetrical hospitals, characterize the clinical course of those who had a positive result, and report symptom development among all women tested in the 2 weeks after hospitalization. Study Design: This is an observational study of asymptomatic pregnant women who underwent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 testing at 2 academic health centers (Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania and Pennsylvania Hospital) in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, between April 13, 2020, and April 26, 2020. All women tested were contacted via telephone for symptom follow-up at 1 and 2 weeks after discharge. Asymptomatic positive test rates are reported for the overall population and by hospital. The hospital and 2-week posthospital course are described for women who had a positive result for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Posthospital symptom development among women who had a negative result for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is also described. Results: A total of 318 asymptomatic women underwent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 testing during this 2-week period; 8 women had a positive result. The overall asymptomatic test positive rate was 2.5%. The rate at Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania was 3.8% compared with 1.3% at Pennsylvania Hospital (P=.283). Of note, 3 women (37.5%) who were initially asymptomatic developed mild symptoms in the 2 weeks after a positive test result. Repeat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 testing was performed in 14 of the 310 women (4.5%) who initially had a negative result; 2 women (0.6%) had a positive result on repeat testing. Moreover, 242 (78.1%) and 213 (68.7%) of the 310 women who had a negative result for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 at the time of the initial hospitalization were followed up via telephone at 1 and 2 weeks after admission, respectively. Viral symptoms, including fevers, chills, shortness of breath, or cough, were self-reported in 4.5% and 4.2% of these women at 1 and 2 weeks after discharge, respectively. Conclusion: The asymptomatic positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 test rate among an obstetrical population in Philadelphia differed between 2 hospitals and was lower than that described in other geographic regions. This supports the importance of institution-specific testing protocols. The development of symptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection after hospitalization among women with initial negative test results is uncommon.","Bender, Whitney R; Hirshberg, Adi; Coutifaris, Paulina; Acker, Alexandra L; Srinivas, Sindhu K",Am J Obstet Gynecol MFM,26,16

Drug repurposing seems to be the solution for the current situation. METHODS: In a quest to find a potential drug against this virus, 15 antimalarial drugs (including chloroquine) and 2413 US Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs were investigated for activity against both the protease and spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 using an in silico approach. Molecular docking analysis followed by molecular dynamics simulation was performed to estimate the binding and stability of the complexes. RESULTS: This study identified a single drug - paromomycin - with activity against two targets of SARS-CoV-2, i.e., spike protein (S1) and protease domain. Paromomycin was found to have strong binding affinity for both targets of coronavirus. The results also showed that no antimalarial drug exhibited effective binding for either S1 or protease. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that paromomycin may be an effective dual targeting drug against coronavirus, as it binds not only to the protease domain of the virion, but also to the spike domain, with high stability. Furthermore, none of the antimalarial drugs showed strong binding affinity for either protease or the receptor binding domain (RBD).","Tariq, Asma; Mateen, Rana Muhammad; Afzal, Muhammad Sohail; Saleem, Mahjabeen",Int J Infect Dis,26,24

Anticoagulation for the prevention of stroke in high-risk patients has the benefit of improving the life expectancy, quality of life, autonomy and social functioning of the patient. The COVID-19 pandemic poses challenges for stroke patients because of the association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and thromboembolic risk. Case description: We describe the case of an 84-year-old female patient admitted due to an embolic stroke and non-anticoagulated AF. Her admission symptoms were sensory-motor aphasia and severe right limb paresis with an NIHSS score of 24. The diagnosis of embolic stroke (namely, total anterior circulation infarct; TACI) was made. Her stroke was extensive so she was not started on anticoagulation. During hospitalization, new embolic events occurred and a concomitant diagnosis of COVID-19 was made with progressive respiratory dysfunction followed by multiorgan failure. The patient died despite appropriate treatment. Discussion: The prognosis of elderly patients with cardioembolic stroke depends on anticoagulation administration. The NIHSS score on admission of our patient meant anticoagulation therapy was not appropriate.

However, these changes may impact on service costs and/or efficiency. The present study was undertaken to analyse the efficiency of the waste management service in Spain, using data from 283 municipalities for the period 2005-2015. The analysis consists of two phases: first, the application of panel data order-m frontiers, that allows to obtain a homogeneous estimation of efficiency based on the input-output relationship at the production process (Surroca et al., 2016), and second, the use of bootstrapped truncated regression, considering different municipal sizes. The results obtained show that cost efficiency is increased with selective collection and by certain political and socio-economic factors of the local governments, concretely with the government by a progressive party, coalition governments, a greater financial independence, a greater tourist and industrial activity and a greater proportion of women and of foreign-born residents in the municipality. We also show that municipal direct provision is the least efficient management form for this service. The main contribution made by this study is to examine the influence of different elements of service output (i.e., selection by type of waste vs. non-selection) on cost efficiency.","Campos-Alba, Cristina María; Garrido-Rodríguez, Juan Carlos; Plata-Díaz, Ana María; Pérez-López, Gemma",Waste Manag,26,20

DESIGN: Retrospective review of Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation data collected from routine clinical care. SETTING: Forty-three hospitals contributing coronavirus disease 2019 patient data between March 14, and June 17, 2020, and 132 hospitals in the United States contributing data on viral pneumonia patients to the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation database between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2019. PATIENTS AND MEASUREMENTS: One thousand four hundred ninety-one patients with diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 infection and 4,200 patients with a primary (n = 2,544) or secondary (n = 1,656) admitting diagnosis of noncoronavirus disease viral pneumonia receiving ICU care. A subset of 202 viral pneumonia patients with concurrent acute respiratory distress syndrome was examined separately. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN RESULTS: Mean age was 63.4 for coronavirus disease (p = 0.064) versus 64.1 for viral pneumonia. Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation-IV scores were similar at 56.7 and 55.0, respectively (p = 0.060), but gender and ethnic distributions differed, as did Pao2 to Fio2 ratio and WBC count at admission. The hospital standardized mortality ratio (95% CI) was 1.52 (1.35-1.68) for coronavirus disease patients and 0.82 (0.75-0.90) for viral pneumonia patients. In the coronavirus disease group, ICU and hospital length of stay were 3.1 and 3.0 days longer than in viral pneumonia patients. Standardized ICU and hospital length of stay ratios were 1.13 and 1.46 in the coronavirus disease group versus 0.95 and 0.94 in viral pneumonia patients. Forty-seven percent of coronavirus disease patients received invasive or noninvasive ventilatory support on their first ICU day versus 65% with viral pneumonia. Ventilator days in survivors were longer in coronavirus disease (10.4 d) than in viral pneumonia (4.3 d) patients, except in the viral pneumonia-acute respiratory distress syndrome subgroup (10.2 d). CONCLUSIONS: Severity-adjusted mortality and length of stay are higher for coronavirus disease 2019 patients than for viral pneumonia patients admitted to ICU. Coronavirus disease patients also have longer time on ventilator and ICU length of stay, comparable with the subset of viral pneumonia patients with concurrent acute respiratory distress syndrome. Mortality and length of stay increase with age and higher scores in both populations, but observed to predicted mortality and length of stay are higher than expected with coronavirus disease patients across all severity of illness levels. These findings have implications for benchmarking ICU outcomes during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.","Higgins, Thomas L; Stark, Maureen M; Henson, Kathy N; Freeseman-Freeman, Laura",Crit Care Med,26,16

As COVID-19 proliferated across the United States, Asian Americans reported a surge in racially motivated hate crimes involving physical violence and harassment. Throughout history, pandemic-related health crises have been associated with the stigmatization and ""othering"" of people of Asian descent. Asian Americans have experienced verbal and physical violence motivated by individual-level racism and xenophobia from the time they arrived in America in the late 1700s up until the present day. At the institutional level, the state has often implicitly reinforced, encouraged, and perpetuated this violence through bigoted rhetoric and exclusionary policies. COVID-19 has enabled the spread of racism and created national insecurity, fear of foreigners, and general xenophobia, which may be related to the increase in anti-Asian hate crimes during the pandemic. We examine how these crimes - situated in historically entrenched and intersecting individual-level and institutional-level racism and xenophobia - have operated to ""other"" Asian Americans and reproduce inequality.","Gover, Angela R; Harper, Shannon B; Langton, Lynn",Am J Crim Justice,26,30

We also proposed the forecasting model based on the time series exponential moving average to identify the growth of disease with respect to Age, Gender and Medical history of the covid-19 positive patient. The results are obtained by defining the correlation function to measure the disease severity in the range of High, Medium and Low. The time series analysis is done with respect to mean average disease severity and also number of positive cases. The forecasting is performed based on the age, gender and existing disorders in health.

OBJECTIVE: We investigated online search behavior related to the COVID-19 outbreak and the attitudes of ""infodemic monikers"" (ie, erroneous information that gives rise to interpretative mistakes, fake news, episodes of racism, etc) circulating in Italy. METHODS: By using Google Trends to explore the internet search activity related to COVID-19 from January to March 2020, article titles from the most read newspapers and government websites were mined to investigate the attitudes of infodemic monikers circulating across various regions and cities in Italy. Search volume values and average peak comparison (APC) values were used to analyze the results. RESULTS: Keywords such as ""novel coronavirus,"" ""China coronavirus,"" ""COVID-19,"" ""2019-nCOV,"" and ""SARS-COV-2"" were the top infodemic and scientific COVID-19 terms trending in Italy. The top five searches related to health were ""face masks,"" ""amuchina"" (disinfectant), ""symptoms of the novel coronavirus,"" ""health bulletin,"" and ""vaccines for coronavirus."" The regions of Umbria and Basilicata recorded a high number of infodemic monikers (APC weighted total >140). Misinformation was widely circulated in the Campania region, and racism-related information was widespread in Umbria and Basilicata. These monikers were frequently searched (APC weighted total >100) in more than 10 major cities in Italy, including Rome. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a growing regional and population-level interest in COVID-19 in Italy. The majority of searches were related to amuchina, face masks, health bulletins, and COVID-19 symptoms. Since a large number of infodemic monikers were observed across Italy, we recommend that health agencies use Google Trends to predict human behavior as well as to manage misinformation circulation in Italy.","Rovetta, Alessandro; Bhagavathula, Akshaya Srikanth",JMIR Public Health Surveill,26,33

The major transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 are recognised as inhalation of aerosol/droplets and person-to-person contact. However, some studies have demonstrated that live SARS-CoV-2 can be isolated from the faeces and urine of infected patients, which can then enter the wastewater system. The currently available evidence indicates that the viral RNA present in wastewater may become a potential source of epidemiological data. However, to investigate whether wastewater may present a risk to humans such as sewage workers, we investigated whether intact particles of SARS-CoV-2 were observable and whether it was possible to isolate the virus in wastewater. Using a correlative strategy of light microscopy and electron microscopy (CLEM), we demonstrated the presence of intact and degraded SARS-like particles in RT-qPCR SARS-CoV-2-positive sewage sample collected in the city of Marseille. However, the viral infectivity assessment of SARS-CoV-2 in the wastewater was inconclusive, due to the presence of other viruses known to be highly resistant in the environment such as enteroviruses, rhinoviruses, and adenoviruses.

The subjects of the study were college students at D University selected by purposeful sampling technique. A semi-structured questionnaire focusing on students’ satisfaction and dissatisfaction with emergency remote teaching as well as their desired improvement was distributed online, and a total of 393 student responses were collected for analysis. According to the results of the study, the most common environment and method for participating in classes were student homes and personal laptops. Students noted some positive features of emergency remote teaching such as comfortable educational environments, smooth interactions, and efficient time utilization, while network instability, unilateral interactions, and reduced concentration were shown to be causes of students’ complaints. Areas students identified for improvement were closely related to the causes of complaints, such as network stabilization, recorded lecture sharing, and the activation of interactions. The results of this study concluded that college students’ educational environments are important, and the quality of interactions can vary depending on the teachers and technology used.

For the detection of IgG, only the Biozek Corona virus COVID rapid test, Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 IgG, and Wantai SARS-CoV-2 antibody (Ab) ELISA met predefined performance criteria in hospitalized patients where samples were collected 14 days post-onset of symptoms (DPO), while for patients with mild or asymptomatic infections, only the Wantai SARS-CoV-2 Ab ELISA met the predefined performance criteria if samples were collected 14 days postonset. Here, we describe this unique nationwide collaboration during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic; the collected data and their results are an example of what can be accomplished when forces are joined during a public health crisis.","van den Beld, Maaike J.

Antigen detection however puts foothold in this aspect even though lacks in sensitivity, especially conventional Rapid Antigen Tests (RATs). Recently developed Chemiluminescence Immunoassay (CLIA) based antigen detection tests are promising and displayed better sensitivity. In the current study we have evaluated VITROS® SARS-CoV-2 Ag Test CLIA Kit, which was tested on 148 patient’s samples attended to a tertiary care centre for testing of SARS-CoV-2. The performance of the kit was evaluated in comparison to RT-PCR and RAT and found to be a good test for antigen detection, best within the first few days of infection. The test has shown sensitivity of 94.3% and specificity of 100% in samples with corresponding Ct values of ≤25 by RT-PCR, which corresponds to high viral load and can predict ability of spreading the disease by the patients. With the results being semiquantitative along with improved sensitivity it can replace RATs for antigen detection for screening, provided good laboratory set up is included under consideration.","Paul, Diptanu; Gupta, Akshita; Rooge, Sheetalnath; Gupta, Ekta",J Virol Methods,26,11

We conducted a comparative demonstration study of the applicability of an internationally validated standardised service classification instrument—the Description and Evaluation of Services and Directories—DESDE-LTC) using the emerging mental health ecosystems research (MHESR) approach. Using DESDE-LTC as the framework, and drawing from international occupation classifications, the workforce was classified according to characteristics including the type of care provided and professional background. Our reference area was the Australian Capital Territory, which we compared with two other urban districts in Australia (Sydney and South East Sydney) and three benchmark international health districts (Helsinki-Uusima (Finland), Verona (Italy) and Gipuzkoa (Spain)). We also compared our data with national level data where available. The Australian and Finnish regions had a larger and more highly skilled workforce than the southern European regions. The pattern of workforce availability and profile varied, even within the same country, at the local level. We found significant differences between regional rates of identified rates of psychiatrists and psychologists, and national averages. Using a standardised classification instrument at the local level, and our occupational groupings, we were able to assess the available workforce and provide information relevant to planners about the actual capacity of the system. Data obtained at local level is critical to providing planners with reliable data to inform their decision making.","Furst, Mary Anne; Salinas-Perez, Jose A.; Gutiérrez-Colosia, Mencia R.; Salvador-Carulla, Luis",PLoS One,26,33

La symptomatologie est parfois frustrée et aspécifique dans cette population. L’objectif est de comparer les caractéristiques d’une population ≥75 ans hospitalisée pour une COVID-19 à celles d’une population<75 ans, en incluant la mortalité toute cause à 28jours du début des signes cliniques. Matériels et méthodes Il s’agit d’une étude prospective observationnelle descriptive monocentrique incluant tous les patients hospitalisés, initialement hors réanimation, avec une COVID-19 confirmée par RT-PCR et/ou par imagerie scanographique entre le 3 mars et le 24 avril 2020. Pour tous les patients, étaient recueillies de façon standardisée des variables démographiques, cliniques et paracliniques. Tous les patients ont eu un suivi clinique et/ou téléphonique jusqu’à j28 du début des signes cliniques. Les caractéristiques des patients de ≥75 ans sont comparées à celles des patients<75 ans (tests du Chi2 et exact de Fisher ; la valeur p <0,05 est considérée comme statistiquement significative). Résultats Ont été hospitalisés 436 patients (femmes : 196 [45 %] ; âge moyen : 69±18 ans ; patients ≥75 ans : 186 [43 %]). Le délai moyen entre le début des symptômes et l’hospitalisation était de 5,8±5jours. Le score moyen de Charlson était de 5,7 (±3). Cinquante-quatre patients (12 %) ont été transférés en réanimation (âge moyen : 67±18 ans). Soixante-dix-neuf patients sont décédés (18 %) dont 7 après leur transfert en réanimation. À l’admission, les patients ≥75 ans présentaient moins souvent des symptômes ORL (8 % vs 16 %, p <0,01), une toux (70 % vs 81 %, p <0,012) et une dyspnée (44 % vs 56 %, p =0,013). À noter qu’ils présentaient aucun signe respiratoire dans 11 % des cas vs dans 5,6 % chez les plus jeunes (p =0,047). Une chute les jours précédant l’hospitalisation, un syndrome confusionnel et une atteinte digestive fébrile étaient plus souvent retrouvés chez les patients ≥75 ans (respectivement, 22 % vs 4 %, p <0,001 ; 19 % vs 5 %, p <0,001 et 6 % vs 2 %, p =0,015). Les transferts en réanimation étaient moins fréquents chez les patients ≥75 ans (6 % vs 18 %, p <0,001), la mortalité toute cause à 28jours y est en revanche plus élevée (30 % vs 8 %, p <0,001). Conclusion Comparés aux<75 ans, les patients ≥75 ans ont moins souvent des symptômes respiratoires et plus souvent des symptômes classiquement retrouvés dans la population gériatrique, quelle que soit l’étiologie : chute, confusion et troubles digestifs.

597656,597656,597656,Twelve months of a unique year,20.221304,3.339958,2021,"Background Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that belong to the Family Coronaviridae, Genus Betacoronavirus. In December 2019, a new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) characterized by severe respiratory symptoms was discovered. The causative pathogen was a novel coronavirus known as 2019-nCoV and later as SARS-CoV-2. Within two months of its discovery, COVID-19 became a pandemic causing widespread morbidity and mortality. Methodology Whole genome sequence data of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from Nigerian COVID-19 cases were retrieved by downloading from GISAID database. A total of 18 sequences that satisfied quality assurance (length ≥ 29700 nts and number of unknown bases denoted as ‘N’ ≤ 5%) were used for the study. Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) was done in MAFFT (Version 7.471) while SNP calling was implemented in DnaSP (Version 6.12.03) respectively and then visualized in Jalview (Version 2.11.1.0). Phylogenetic analysis was with MEGA X software. Results Nigerian SARS-CoV-2 had 99.9% genomic similarity with four large conserved genomic regions. A total of 66 SNPs were identified out of which 31 were informative. Nucleotide diversity assessment gave Pi = 0.00048 and average SNP frequency of 2.22 SNPs per 1000 nts. Non-coding genomic regions particularly 5’UTR and 3’UTR had a SNP density of 3.77 and 35.4 respectively. The region with the highest SNP density was ORF10 with a frequency of 8.55 SNPs/1000 nts). Majority (72.2%) of viruses in Nigeria are of L lineage with preponderance of D614G mutation which accounted for 11 (61.1%) out of the 18 viral sequences. Nigeria SARS-CoV-2 revealed 3 major clades namely Oyo, Ekiti and Osun on a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree. Conclusion and Recommendation Nigerian SARS-CoV-2 reveals high mutation rate together with preponderance of L lineage and D614G mutants. Implication of these mutations for SARS-CoV-2 virulence and the need for more aggressive testing and treatment of COVID-19 in Nigeria is discussed. Additionally, attempt to produce testing kits for COVID-19 in Nigeria should consider the conserved regions identified in this study. Strict adherence to COVID-19 preventive measure is recommended in view of Nigerian SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic clustering pattern, which suggests intensive community transmission possibly rooted in communal culture characteristic of many ethnicities in Nigeria.","Taiwo, Idowu A.; Adeleye, Nike; Anwoju, Fatimah O.; Adeyinka, Adeyemi; Uzoma, Ijeoma C.; Bankole, Taiwo T.",bioRxiv,26,13

Using genetically diverse animals from incipient lines of the Collaborative Cross mouse panel, we demonstrate a greatly expanded range of phenotypes relative to classical mouse models of SARS-CoV infection including lung pathology, weight loss and viral titer. Genetic mapping revealed several loci contributing to differential disease responses, including an 8.5Mb locus associated with vascular cuffing on chromosome 3 that contained 23 genes and 13 noncoding RNAs. Integrating phenotypic and genetic data narrowed this region to a single gene, Trim55, an E3 ubiquitin ligase with a role in muscle fiber maintenance. Lung pathology and transcriptomic data from mice genetically deficient in Trim55 were used to validate its role in SARS-CoV-induced vascular cuffing and inflammation. These data establish the Collaborative Cross platform as a powerful genetic resource for uncovering genetic contributions of complex traits in microbial disease severity, inflammation and virus replication in models of outbred populations.","Gralinski, Lisa E.; Ferris, Martin T.; Aylor, David L.; Whitmore, Alan C.; Green, Richard; Frieman, Matthew B.; Deming, Damon; Menachery, Vineet D.; Miller, Darla R.; Buus, Ryan J.; Bell, Timothy A.; Churchill, Gary A.; Threadgill, David W.; Katze, Michael G.; McMillan, Leonard; Valdar, William; Heise, Mark T.; Pardo-Manuel de Villena, Fernando; Baric, Ralph S.",PLoS Genet,26,18

The reimbursement of services is negotiated between the respective medical institution and the health insurance companies and includes regionally divergent billing on the basis of lump sums, per minute worked or mixed models. From a psychiatric psychotherapeutic point of view the treatment of gerontopsychiatric patients in their living environment and thus in their social context offers many advantages. A prerequisite for the success of this approach is a multiprofessional treatment team that is also experienced in somatic illnesses and logistically highly flexible.

By identifying key processes of disease diffusion in space, we can explain the spatial patterns of the COVID‐19 outbreak in Germany, which did not feature the well‐known patterns of spatially contagious as in or hierarchical diffusion. In contrast, we find superspreading events and especially relocation diffusion based on existing networks, on which the pathogen travelled like a blind passenger, to be more relevant.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study targeted dentists in the West Bank area of Palestine using an on-line survey during the first two weeks of May, 2020. Questions mainly asked about dentists’ perception of the risks of COVID-19, readiness to reopen their clinics for routine care, and the level of confidence in dealing with suspected COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Four hundred and forty-eight dentists completed the survey. Almost 60% believed that they were not ready to re-open their practices. Almost 13% had “no confidence” in dealing with COVID-19 patients, while 64% had “little to moderate” confidence. Confidence was correlated negatively with increased fear of getting infected (ρ=-0.317, p<0.0001) and positively with years of practice (ρ=1.7, p< 0.0001). Dentists who received updated training on infection control or on COVID-19 reported higher levels of confidence (X(2) =53.8,p<0.0001, X(2)=26.8, p<0.0001 respectively). Although 88% preferred not to treat COVID-19 patients, 40% were willing to provide care to them. Almost 75% reported that they were already facing financial hardships and couldn't survive financially until the end of the current month. CONCLUSIONS: Ethical and financial reasons were the main drivers for dentists in this sample to re-open their practices for routine care. Data from this study highlights the fragility of private dental practice in emergency situations. Ethical, health and financial challenges that emerged during COVID-19 require dentists to adapt and be better prepared to face future crises.","Kateeb, Elham T; Juniedi, Raed N; Warren, John J",Int Dent J,26,2

This review examines the global impact of COVID-19 pandemic on incidence of STEMI admissions, and relationship between the pandemic and door-to-balloon time (D2B), all-cause mortality and other secondary STEMI outcomes. Methods We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to primarily compare D2B time and in-hospital mortality of STEMI patients who underwent primary PCI during and before the pandemic. Subgroup analyses were performed to investigate the influence of geographical region and income status of a country on STEMI care. An online database search included studies comparing the aforementioned outcomes between STEMI patients during and before the pandemic. Results In total, 32 articles were analyzed. Overall, 19,140 and 68,662 STEMI patients underwent primary PCI during and before the pandemic respectively. Significant delay in D2B was observed during the pandemic (WMD=8.10mins; CI:3.90-12.30mins; p=0.0002, I2=90%). In-hospital mortality was higher during the pandemic (OR=1.27; CI:1.09-1.49; p=0.002, I2=36%), however this varied with factors such as geographical location and income status of a country. Subgroup analysis found that low-middle income countries observed a higher rate of mortality during the pandemic (OR=1.52; CI:1.13-2.05; p=0.006), with a similar but insignificant trend seen among the high income countries (OR=1.17; CI:0.95-1.44; p=0.13).

This study documents the impact of the pandemic and the lockdown measures on the profile of people going through the abortion process. METHODS: Using anonymized patient records from a Belgian abortion centre, we first compared the number of abortion requests and procedures during the first COVID-19 lockdown with the same months in the five preceding years. Next, we analysed the social profile of people requesting an abortion in those two time periods and looked at the number of long-acting reversible contraceptive devices (LARC) placed after curettage. RESULTS: The abortion centre saw a drop in the number of abortion requests during the lockdown. This difference was more pronounced for people in paid employment and people using (modern) contraception. People were also more likely to request an abortion earlier in their pregnancy. The drop in abortion procedures and LARC’s placed after curettage was proportionate to the drop in abortion requests and did not differ according to clients’ characteristics. CONCLUSION: Questions arose concerning the potential selectivity with which COVID-19 influenced the need for abortion care and accessibility to services. Although there was a general drop in abortion requests and procedures during the first COVID-19 lockdown in the studied abortion centre, our results suggest that the profile of people requesting and receiving an abortion did only slightly change during the lockdown, and did not affect vulnerable groups visibly harder.

A Swedish isolate of PCV2 (S-PCV2) retrieved in 1993 from a healthy pig has been used in this model to reproduce PMWS in pigs from Northern Ireland. This virus has been present in the Swedish pig population for at least a decade without causing any known PMWS disease problems, despite its potential pathogenicity. The reasons for this are unknown, but could be related to genetics, absence of triggers for PCV2 upregulation (infectious agent and/or management forms) within Swedish pig husbandry. In order to confirm the pathogenicity of S-PCV2, Swedish and Danish pigs were experimentally infected with this isolate according to the established model. Swedish pigs were also infected with a reference isolate of PCV2 (PCV2-1010) to compare the severity of disease caused by the two isolates in Swedish pigs. Both Danish and Swedish pigs developed PMWS after the experimental infection with S-PCV2. Antibodies to PCV2 developed later and reached lower levels in serum from pigs infected with S-PCV2 than in pigs inoculated with PCV2-1010. In general, pigs infected with S-PCV2 showed more severe clinical signs of disease than pigs infected with PCV2-1010, but pigs from all PCV2-inoculated groups displayed gross and histological lesions consistent with PMWS. All pigs inoculated with PPV, alone or in combination with PCV2, displayed interleukin-10 responses in serum while only pigs infected with PPV in combination with PCV2 showed interferon-α in serum on repeated occasions. Thus, the pathogenicity of S-PCV2 was confirmed and a role for cytokines in the etiology of PMWS was indicated.","Hasslung, F.; Wallgren, P.; Ladekjær-Hansen, A.-S.; Bøtner, A.; Nielsen, J.; Wattrang, E.; Allan, G.M.; McNeilly, F.; Ellis, J.; Timmusk, S.; Belák, K.; Segall, T.; Melin, L.; Berg, M.; Fossum, C.",Vet Microbiol,26,20

Its role in coagulation and thrombosis is well-established. Nevertheless, thrombin also plays a major role in inflammation by activating protease-activated receptors. In addition, thrombin is also involved in angiogenesis, fibrosis, and viral infections. Considering the pathogenesis of COVID-19 pandemic, thrombin inhibitors may exert multiple potential therapeutic benefits including antithrombotic, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral activities. In this review, we describe the clinical features of COVID-19, the thrombin’s roles in various pathologies, and the potential of argatroban in COVID-19 patients. Argatroban is a synthetic, small molecule, direct, competitive, and selective inhibitor of thrombin. It is approved to parenterally prevent and/or treat heparin-induced thrombocytopenia in addition to other thrombotic conditions. Argatroban also possesses anti-inflammatory and antiviral activities and has a well-established pharmacokinetics profile. It also appears to lack a significant risk of drug–drug interactions with therapeutics currently being evaluated for COVID-19. Thus, argatroban presents a substantial promise in treating severe cases of COVID-19; however, this promise is yet to be established in randomized, controlled clinical trials.","Aliter, Kholoud F.; Al-Horani, Rami A.",Cardiovasc Drugs Ther,26,20

Spike proteins consist of S1 and S2 domains, which recognize angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors and contain the viral fusion machinery, respectively. Ostensibly, the binding of spike trimers to ACE2 receptors promotes the preparation of the fusion machinery by dissociation of the S1 domains. We report the development of bottom-up coarse-grained (CG) models validated with cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) data, and the use of CG molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the dynamical mechanisms involved in viral binding and exposure of the S2 trimeric core. We show that spike trimers cooperatively bind to multiple ACE2 dimers at virion-cell interfaces. The multivalent interaction cyclically and processively induces S1 dissociation, thereby exposing the S2 core containing the fusion machinery. Our simulations thus reveal an important concerted interaction between spike trimers and ACE2 dimers that primes the virus for membrane fusion and entry.","Pak, Alexander J.; Yu, Alvin; Ke, Zunlong; Briggs, John A.

Patients call this long Covid. We sought to document the lived experience of such patients, their accounts of accessing and receiving healthcare, and their ideas for improving services. Method We held 55 individual interviews and 8 focus groups (n = 59) with people recruited from UK-based long Covid patient support groups, social media and snowballing. We restricted some focus groups to health professionals since they had already self-organised into online communities. Participants were invited to tell their personal stories and comment on other stories. Data were audiotaped, transcribed, anonymised and coded using NVIVO. Analysis incorporated sociological theories of illness, healing, peer support, the clinical relationship, access to care, and service redesign. Results The sample was 70% female, aged 27-73 years, and comprised White British (74%), Asian (11%), White Other (7%), Black (4%), and Mixed (4%). 27 were doctors and 23 other health professionals. Approximately 10% had been hospitalised. Analysis revealed a confusing illness with many, varied and often relapsing-remitting symptoms and uncertain prognosis; a heavy sense of loss and stigma; difficulty accessing and navigating services; difficulty being taken seriously and achieving a diagnosis; disjointed and siloed care (including inability to access specialist services); variation in standards (e.g. inconsistent criteria for seeing, investigating and referring patients); variable quality of the therapeutic relationship (some participants felt well supported while others described feeling fobbed off); and possible critical events (e.g. deterioration after being unable to access services). Emotional touch points in participant experiences informed ideas for improving services. Conclusion Quality principles for a long Covid service should include ensuring access to care, reducing burden of illness, taking clinical responsibility and providing continuity of care, multi-disciplinary rehabilitation, evidence-based investigation and management, and further development of the knowledge base and clinical services.","Ladds, E.; Rushforth, A.; Wieringa, S.; Taylor, S.; Rayner, C.; Husain, L.; Greenhalgh, T.",,26,20

According to the Green Paper on Urban Mobility, the combination of passenger and freight flows may be a valid approach to promote sustainable, efficient and socially desirable FLM transport. This paper proposes a set of key performance indicators to evaluate potential improvements in operational, environmental and social performances of integrated passenger and freight flows, compared to the current transport schemes. The two case studies of the Northern lagoon of Venice in Italy and the Slovenian Municipality of Velenje indicate that the model may be particularly effective in those cases where reduced freight volumes, limited freight pickup/delivery locations and a lower elasticity of the travel demand reduce the constraints to the adoption of this integrated scheme. Results call for a reduction both in distances travelled and in externalities produced, and hence a good potential in FLM terms. Beside these technical aspects, one of the main issues is the need for innovation in the normative/regulatory context: a prerequisite in order to apply this solution to real-life contexts.","Bruzzone, Francesco; Cavallaro, Federico; Nocera, Silvio",Transp Policy (Oxf),26,16

Methods: We tracked the data until March 5, 2020. The cases in our cohort were divided into cases only received noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and cases required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). The characteristics between the two groups were compared. Results: 34 cases were included in the study. The complications rate (including, acute liver injury, acute cardiac injury and acute kidney injury) were higher in IMV cases. Lymphocytopenia and neutrophilia occurred in most cases in both groups on the admission day, however, lymphocyte levels dropped progressively and more severe lymphopenia occurred in IMV group. Increased amounts of plasma IL-6 and IL-10 were found in both groups on the admission day, the progressive decrease of which occurred in NIV cases rather than IMV cases, and the levels were higher in IMV cases during hospitalization. Conclusions: Lymphocytopenia, neutrophilia, and increase of IL-6 and IL-10 occurred in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients in ICU, however, the dynamics of those were significantly different in IMV cases and NIV cases during hospitalization.","Zheng, Yi; Sun, Lijun; Xu, Mi; Pan, Jian; Zhang, Yuntao; Fang, Xueling; Fang, Qiang; Cai, Hongliu",,26,24

Results revealed the comparatively strong relationships between some independent variables (e.g., total greenhouse gas emissions, CO(2) emissions, nitrous oxide emissions, and urban population) and confirmed cases (R from 0.619 to 0.695), demonstrating the possible effective role of urbanization and its induced GHG emissions on the COVID-19 outbreak in the country level of the MECA region. Therefore, the results significantly confirmed the strong relationships between some independent variables (e.g., total population, urban population, fuel consumption, NO(2)–CO(2) emissions, energy use, and total intra-changed travels) and confirmed cases (R from 0.724 to 0.945), explaining an explicit relationship between urbanization processes and the COVID-19 outbreak in Iran. Besides, the HCA results revealed the substantial role of the urban population and urban-induced energy use and gas emission in clustering locations regarding the COVID-19 outbreak in both the MECA region and Iran.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) glycoprotein is a major immunogenic and protective protein, and plays a crucial role in viral pathogenesis. In this study, we successfully constructed a synthetic codon-optimized DNA-based vaccine as a countermeasure against SARS-CoV-2; denoted as VIU-1005. The design was based on the synthesis of codon-optimized coding sequence for optimal mammalian expression of a consensus full-length S glycoprotein. The successful construction of the vaccine was confirmed by restriction digestion and sequencing, and the protein expression of the S protein was confirmed by western blot and immunofluorescence staining in mammalian cells. The immunogenicity of the vaccine was tested in two mouse models (BALB/c and C57BL/6J). Th1-skewed systemic S-specific IgG antibodies and neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) were significantly induced in both models four weeks post three injections with 100 μg of the VIU-1005 vaccine via intramuscular needle injection but not intradermal or subcutaneous routes. Importantly, such immunization induced long-lasting IgG response in mice that lasted for at least 6 months. Interestingly, using a needle-free system, we showed an enhanced immunogenicity of VIU-1005 in which lower doses such as 25-50 μg or less number of doses were able to elicit significantly high levels of Th1-biased systemic S-specific IgG antibodies and nAbs via intramuscular immunization compared to needle immunization. Compared to the intradermal needle injection which failed to induce any significant immune response, intradermal needle-free immunization elicited robust Th1-biased humoral response similar to that observed with intramuscular immunization. Furthermore, immunization with VIU-1005 induced potent S-specific cellular response as demonstrated by the significantly high levels of IFN-γ, TNF and IL-2 cytokines production in memory CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in BALB/c mice. Together, our results demonstrate that the synthetic VIU-1005 candidate DNA vaccine is highly immunogenic and capable of inducing long-lasting and Th1-skewed immune response in mice. Furthermore, we show that the use of needle-free system could enhance the immunogenicity and minimize doses needed to induce protective immunity in mice, supporting further preclinical and clinical testing of this candidate vaccine.","Alamri, Sawsan S; Alluhaybi, Khalid A; Alhabbab, Rowa Y; Algaissi, Abdullah; Almahboub, Sarah; Alfaleh, Mohamed A; Abujamel, Turki S; Abdulaal, Wesam; ElAssouli, M-Zaki; Alharbi, Rahaf; Hassanain, Mazen; Hashem, Anwar M",bioRxiv,26,5

Molecular structural mechanics approach has been used for investigating the vibrational responses of zigzag and armchair double-walled carbon nanotube-based nano biosensors. The elastic properties of beam element are calculated by considering mechanical characteristics of covalent bonds between the carbon atoms in the hexagonal lattice. Spring elements are used to describe the interlayer interactions between the inner and outer tubes caused due to the van der Waals forces. The mass of each beam element is assumed as point mass at nodes coinciding with carbon atoms at inner and outer wall of DWCNT.

Moreover, we aimed to examine the effects of the family-oriented social program “Family 500+” by comparing the situation in various types of households with children a few years before and after the program was launched. The analysis was based on the set of eight-item FI indicators adopted by the Food and Agriculture Organization using the Gallup World Poll nationally representative survey data. Based on our results the most vulnerable groups in the context of FI were identified. We confirmed the importance of education, gender, age, marital status, household composition, status of employment and income in preventing FI. The effectiveness of the support program in reducing FI was demonstrated as households with at least three children experienced significant improvement in the FI status during the studied years. These findings should be especially important in the context of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on FI. As FI can affect the quality and quantity of food choices it is associated with a poorer health status, which increases the risk of infection, including COVID-19, and worsens recovery prognosis.

METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search through the PubMed, Scopus and Embase from the inception of databases until 6 April 2021. The intervention group was SOF/DCV, and the control group was standard of care. The primary outcome was mortality, defined as clinically validated death. The secondary outcomes were (1) the need for ICU admission or IMV and (2) clinical recovery. The pooled effect estimates were reported as risk ratios (RRs). RESULTS: There were four studies with a total of 231 patients in this meta-analysis. Three studies were randomised controlled trial, and one study was non-randomised. SOF/DCV was associated with lower mortality (RR: 0.31 (0.12, 0.78); p=0.013; I(2): 0%) and reduced need for ICU admission or IMV (RR: 0.35 (0.18, 0.69); p=0.002; I(2): 0%). Clinical recovery was achieved more frequently in the SOF/DCV (RR: 1.20 (1.04, 1.37); p=0.011; I(2): 21.1%). There was a moderate certainty of evidence for mortality and need for ICU/IMV outcome, and a low certainty of evidence for clinical recovery. The absolute risk reductions were 140 fewer per 1000 for mortality and 186 fewer per 1000 for the need for ICU/IMV. The increase in clinical recovery was 146 more per 1000.

These disadvantages have led to inequalities and inequities in health care access and poorer health outcomes. We report disproportionate disparities in prevalence, hospitalisation, and deaths from COVID-19 by racial minority populations. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search of relevant databases to identify studies reporting on prevalence, hospitalisations, and deaths from COVID-19 by race groups between 01 January 2020 – 15 April 2021. We grouped race categories into Blacks, Hispanics, Whites and Others. Random effects model using the method of DerSimonian and Laird were fitted, and forest plot with respective ratio estimates and 95% confidence interval (CI) for each race category, and subgroup meta-regression analyses and the overall pooled ratio estimates for prevalence, hospitalisation and mortality rate were presented. RESULTS: Blacks experienced significantly higher burden of COVID-19: prevalence ratio 1.79 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.59-1.99), hospitalisation ratio 1.87 (95% CI = 1.69-2.04), mortality ratio 1.68 (95% CI = 1.52-1.83), compared to Whites: prevalence ratio 0.70 (95% CI = 0.0.64-0.77), hospitalisation ratio 0.74 (95% CI = 0.65-0.82), mortality ratio 0.82 (95% CI = 0.78-0.87). Also, Hispanics experienced a higher burden: prevalence ratio 1.78 (95% CI = 1.63-1.94), hospitalisation ratio 1.32 (95% CI = 1.08-1.55), mortality ratio 0.94 (95% CI = 0.84-1.04) compared to Whites. A higher burden was also observed for Other race groups: prevalence ratio 1.43 (95% CI = 1.19-1.67), hospitalisation ratio 1.12 (95% CI = 0.89-1.35), mortality ratio 1.06 (95% CI = 0.89-1.23) compared to Whites. The disproportionate burden among Blacks and Hispanics remained following correction for publication bias. CONCLUSIONS: Blacks and Hispanics have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19. This is deeply concerning and highlights the systemically entrenched disadvantages (social, economic, and political) experienced by racial minorities in western countries; and this study underscores the need to address inequities in these communities to improve overall health outcomes.","Mude, William; Oguoma, Victor M; Nyanhanda, Tafadzwa; Mwanri, Lillian; Njue, Carolyne",J Glob Health,26,20

Rituximab‐treated pwMS should be counseled to take extra precautions in the 5 months following each infusion. Using extended dosing intervals and lower doses could be considered.","Langer‐Gould, Annette; Smith, Jessica B.; Li, Bonnie H.",Ann Clin Transl Neurol,26,24

To this end, six out of 31 provinces in China are first selected as research samples, central and provincial new energy policies in the period of 2010 to 2019 are collected to establish a text corpus with 23, 674 documents. Then, the policy corpus is fed to two different topic models, one is the Latent Dirichlet Allocation for modeling static policy topics, another is the Dynamic Topic Model for extracting topics over time. Finally, the obtained topics are mapped into policy tools for comparisons. The dynamic policy topics are further analyzed with the panel data from provincial new energy industries. The results show that the provincial new energy policies moved to different tracks after about 2014 due to the regional conditions such as the economy and CO(2) emission intensity. Underdeveloped provinces tend to use environment-oriented tools to regulate and control CO(2) emissions, while developed regions employ the more balanced policy mix for improving new energy vehicles and other industries. Widespread hysteretic effects are revealed during the correlation analysis of the policy topics and new energy capacity.","Wang, Qiqing; Li, Cunbin",PLoS One,26,21

We here approach olfaction as a sense of well-being and review the available literature on how the sense of smell contributes to building and maintaining well-being through supporting nutrition and social relationships. Humans seem to be able to extract nutritional information from olfactory food cues, which can trigger specific appetite and direct food choice, but may not always impact actual intake behavior. Beyond food enjoyment, as part of quality of life, smell has the ability to transfer and regulate emotional conditions, and thus impacts social relationships, at various stages across life (e.g., prenatal and postnatal, during puberty, for partner selection and in sickness). A better understanding of how olfactory information is processed and employed for these functions so vital for well-being may be used to reduce potential negative consequences.","Boesveldt, Sanne; Parma, Valentina",Cell Tissue Res,26,9

Understanding the association between Se and chronic diseases is essential for guiding clinical practice, developing effective public health policies, and ultimately counteracting health issues associated with Se deficiency. The current review will discuss the food sources of Se, biofortification strategies, metabolism and biological activities, clinical disorders and dietary reference intakes, as well as the relationship between Se and health outcomes, especially cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic inflammation, cancer, and fertility. Additionally, some concepts were proposed, there is a non-linear U-shaped dose-responsive relationship between Se status and health effects: subjects with a low baseline Se status can benefit from Se supplementation, while Se supplementation in populations with an adequate or high status may potentially increase the risk of some diseases. In addition, at supra-nutritional levels, methylated Se compounds exerted more promising cancer chemo-preventive efficacy in preclinical trials.","Hu, Wenli; Zhao, Chong; Hu, Hongbo; Yin, Shutao",Nutrients,26,17

Due to the overwhelming use of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests worldwide, availability of test kits has become a major bottleneck, while the need to increase testing throughput only rises. We aim to overcome these challenges by pooling samples together, performing RNA extraction and RT-PCR in pools. METHODS: We tested the efficiency and sensitivity of pooling strategies for RNA extraction and RT-PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2. We tested 184 samples both individually and in pools to estimate the effects of pooling. We further implemented Dorfman pooling with a pool size of 8 samples in large-scale clinical tests. RESULTS: We demonstrated pooling strategies that increase testing throughput while maintaining high sensitivity. A comparison of 184 samples tested individually and in pools of 8 samples, showed that test results were not significantly affected. Implementing the 8-sample Dorfman pooling to test 26,576 samples from asymptomatic individuals, we identified 31 (0.12%) SARS-CoV-2 positive samples, achieving a 7.3-fold increase in throughput. CONCLUSIONS: Pooling approaches for SARS-CoV-2 testing allow a drastic increase in throughput while maintaining clinical sensitivity.

We computationally contrasted the binding interactions between human ACE2 and coronavirus spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) of the 2002 epidemic-causing SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and bat coronavirus RaTG13 using the Rosetta energy function. We find that the RBD of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is highly optimized to achieve very strong binding with human ACE2 (hACE2) which is consistent with its enhanced infectivity. SARS-CoV-2 forms the most stable complex with hACE2 compared to SARS-CoV-1 (23% less stable) or RaTG13 (11% less stable). Notably, we calculate that the SARS-CoV-2 RBD lowers the binding strength of angiotensin 2 receptor type I (ATR1) which is the native binding partner of ACE2 by 44.2%. Strong binding is mediated through strong electrostatic attachments with every fourth residue on the N-terminus alpha-helix (starting from Ser19 to Asn53) as the turn of the helix makes these residues solvent accessible. By contrasting the spike protein SARS-CoV-2 Rosetta binding energy with ACE2 of different livestock and pet species we find strongest binding with bat ACE2 followed by human, feline, equine, canine and finally chicken. This is consistent with the hypothesis that bats are the viral origin and reservoir species. These results offer a computational explanation for the increased infection susceptibility by SARS-CoV-2 and allude to therapeutic modalities by identifying and rank-ordering the ACE2 residues involved in binding with the virus.","Chowdhury, Ratul; Boorla, Veda Sheersh; Maranas, Costas D.",Comput Struct Biotechnol J,26,30

Although NPIs have been implemented globally during the COVID-19 pandemic, their intensity and timing have varied widely. This paper analyzed the country-level determinants and effects of NPIs during the early stages of the pandemic (January 1st to April 29th, 2020). We examined countries that had implemented NPIs within 30 or 45 days since first case detection, as well as countries in which 30 or 45 days had passed since first case detection. The health and socioeconomic factors associated with delay in implementation of three NPIs—national school closure, national lockdown, and global travel ban—were analyzed using fractional logit and probit models, and beta regression models. The probability of implementation of national school closure, national lockdown, and strict national lockdown by a country was analyzed using a probit model. The effects of these three interventions on mobility changes were analyzed with propensity score matching methods using Google’s social mobility reports. Countries with larger populations and better health preparedness measures had greater delays in implementation. Countries with greater population density, higher income, more democratic political systems, and later arrival of first cases were more likely to implement NPIs within 30 or 45 days of first case detection. Implementation of lockdowns significantly reduced physical mobility. Mobility was further reduced when lockdowns were enforced with curfews or fines, or when they were more strictly defined. National school closures did not significantly change mobility.

In this study, we have applied Mendelian randomization (MR) to systematically evaluate the effect of 10 cardiometabolic risk factors and genetic liability to lifetime smoking on 97 circulating host proteins postulated to either interact or contribute to the maladaptive host response of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: We applied the inverse variance weighted (IVW) approach and several robust MR methods in a two-sample setting to systemically estimate the genetically predicted effect of each risk factor in turn on levels of each circulating protein. Multivariable MR was conducted to simultaneously evaluate the effects of multiple risk factors on the same protein. We also applied MR using cis-regulatory variants at the genomic location responsible for encoding these proteins to estimate whether their circulating levels may influence severe SARS-CoV-2. FINDINGS: In total, we identified evidence supporting 105 effects between risk factors and circulating proteins which were robust to multiple testing corrections and sensitivity analyzes. For example, body mass index provided evidence of an effect on 23 circulating proteins with a variety of functions, such as inflammatory markers c-reactive protein (IVW Beta=0.34 per standard deviation change, 95% CI=0.26 to 0.41, P = 2.19 × 10(−16)) and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IVW Beta=0.23, 95% CI=0.17 to 0.30, P = 9.04 × 10(−12)). Further analyzes using multivariable MR provided evidence that the effect of BMI on lowering immunoglobulin G, an antibody class involved in protection from infection, is substantially mediated by raised triglycerides levels (IVW Beta=-0.18, 95% CI=-0.25 to -0.12, P = 2.32 × 10(−08), proportion mediated=44.1%). The strongest evidence that any of the circulating proteins highlighted by our initial analysis influence severe SARS-CoV-2 was identified for soluble glycoprotein 130 (odds ratio=1.81, 95% CI=1.25 to 2.62, P = 0.002), a signal transductor for interleukin-6 type cytokines which are involved in inflammatory response. However, based on current case samples for severe SARS-CoV-2 we were unable to replicate findings in independent samples. INTERPRETATION: Our findings highlight several key proteins which are influenced by established exposures for disease. Future research to determine whether these circulating proteins mediate environmental effects onto risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or covid-19 progression are warranted to help elucidate therapeutic strategies for severe covid-19 disease.

Thus pandemics have two main components: virology (focused on the virus) and toxicology (focused on the toxic stressors). The present chapter will focus mainly on the immune system toxicology component. It identifies the factors shown most frequently to increase immune system dysfunction, and then addresses vaccine toxicology in detail. The chapter concludes by reviewing two types of treatments: immune-augmenting and immune-strengthening. The immune-augmenting approaches are virology-centric (e.g., quarantine, face masks, repurposed antiviral treatments, vaccines, etc.), and the immune-strengthening approaches are toxicology-centric (e.g., eliminating the factors that contribute to immune system dysfunction, and adding factors that increase immune system health).","Kostoff, Ronald N.; Briggs, Michael B.; Porter, Alan L.",Toxicological Risk Assessment and Multi-System Health Impacts from Exposure,26,32

We aimed to determine if gemcitabine-docetaxel when administered every 14-day would be as effective and less toxic compared to the 21-day schedule. Our study shows that indeed when administered in 14-day schedule gemcitabine-docetaxel chemotherapy results in similar chance of tumor shrinkage and survival yet fewer febrile neutropenia and discontinuation of chemotherapy due to intolerance, compared to 21-day schedule. Therefore, 14-day gemcitabine-docetaxel chemotherapy is safer and can be broadly adopted for the treatment of advanced soft tissue and bone sarcomas. ABSTRACT: Gemcitabine-docetaxel (G-D) combination is an effective chemotherapy for patients with advanced soft tissue and bone sarcoma, first developed with G administered on days 1 and 8, and D on day 8 every 21 days and later modified to be administered every 14 days in 2012. The 14-day regimen has become increasingly adopted. However, its efficacy and toxicities have not been compared. We identified 161 patients with metastatic or locally advanced soft tissue and bone sarcoma treated with either a 14-day or 21-day regimen within Northern California Kaiser Permanente from 1 January 2017 to 30 July 2020 and compared the outcomes and toxicity profiles of patients treated with the either regimen. Seventy-nine (49%) and 82 (51%) patients received the 14-day and the 21-day regimen, respectively, with similar response rate (22.8% and 15.8%, p = 0.26), median progression-free survival (PFS, 4.0 and 3.2 months, p = 0.15), and median overall survival (OS, 12.6 and 14.7 months, p = 0.55). Subset analysis of the untreated patients (approximately 60% of the entire cohort) as well as the patients with leiomyosarcoma only (approximately 50% of the entire cohort) showed that OS was not significantly different between the two regimens. Febrile neutropenia requiring hospitalization occurred in 10 and one patients (p = 0.006) and intolerance leading to discontinuation of chemotherapy occurred in 12 and two patients (p = 0.006) treated with the 21-day and the 14-day regimens, respectively. CDKN2A deletion/mutation or CDK4 amplification was associated with worse median OS (p = 0.06), while a RB1 deletion/mutation was associated with better median PFS (p = 0.05), and these two genomic alterations were mutually exclusive. Our data demonstrate that, compared to the traditional 21-day G-D regimen, the 14-day G-D regimen is equally effective but safer. In addition, CDKN2A and RB1 pathways play significant role on the outcomes of the patients.","Pan, Minggui; Trieu, Maily K.; Sidhu, Manpreet; Yu, Jeanette; Seto, Tiffany; Ganjoo, Kristen",Cancers (Basel),26,5

Commercial spray‐dried porcine plasma was sterilized by irradiation and then reconstituted (1:9) with sterile water. Aliquots of reconstituted plasma were inoculated with either S. choleraesuis or S. typhimurium, subjected to spray‐drying at an inlet temperature of 200°C and an outlet temperature of either 71 or 80°C, and each spray‐drying temperature combinations were subjected to either 0, 30 or 60 s of residence time (RT) as a simulation of residence time typical of commercial dryers. Spray‐dried samples were stored at either 4·0 ± 3·0°C or 23·0 ± 0·3°C for 15 days. Bacterial counts of each Salmonella spp., were completed for all samples. For both Salmonella spp., spray‐drying at both outlet temperatures reduced bacterial counts about 3 logs at RT 0 s, while there was about a 5·5 log reduction at RT 60 s. Storage of all dried samples at either 4·0 ± 3·0°C or 23·0 ± 0·3°C for 15 days eliminate all detectable bacterial counts of both Salmonella spp. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Safety of raw materials from animal origin like spray‐dried porcine plasma (SDPP) may be a concern for the swine industry. Spray‐drying process and postdrying storage are good inactivation steps to reduce the bacterial load of Salmonella choleraesuis and Salmonella typhimurium.

In the healthcare sector, the doctor is the industrial artisan, and medicine can be considered as an example of a smart tool, strongly tailored, that embeds the innovation of materials, nano-devices, and smart technology (e.g., sensors and controllers). But how much of society is ready to host smart technology “on board”, becoming “on life”, constantly connected with remote controls that allow us to monitor, gather data, and, in any case, act, with preventive healthcare solutions? After a short overview of the medicine sector, a preliminary, tentative link between technological innovation and the healthcare sector allows us to adopt several outlooks on how to change research, always more transdisciplinary, combining science with social science in order to remain human-centered.","Ioppolo, Giuseppe; Vazquez, Franck; Hennerici, Michael G.; Andrès, Emmanuel",J Clin Med,26,24

A call for global vaccination of COVID-19 plays a pivotal role in the fight against this virus. With the development of COVID-19 vaccines, public willingness to accept a vaccination has become an important concern of public health given the vaccine hesitancy observed in the world. Social media is powerful in monitoring public attitudes and assess the dissemination, which would provide valuable information for policy makers. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the responses of vaccine positivity on social media when major public events (major outbreaks) or major adverse event of vaccination (COVID-19 or other similar vaccines) were reported. METHODS: A total of 340,783 vaccine-related posts was captured with the poster's information on Weibo, the biggest social platform in China. After data cleaning, 156,223 posts were included in the subsequent analysis. By using pandas and SnowNLP Python libraries, posts were classified into 2 categories, positive and negative. After model training and sentiment analysis, the proportion of positive posts was computed to measure the public positivity toward the COVID-19 vaccine. RESULTS: The positivity of COVID-19 vaccine in China tends to fluctuate over time in the range of 45.7% to 77.0% and is intuitively correlated with public health events. In terms of gender, males were more positive (70.0% of the time) than females. In terms of region, when regional epidemics arose, not only the region with the epidemic and surrounding regions but even the whole country showed more positive attitudes to varying degrees. When the epidemic subsided temporarily, positivity decreased with varying degrees in each region. CONCLUSIONS: In China, public positivity of COVID-19 vaccines fluctuates over time and a regional epidemic or news on social media may cause significant variations in willingness to accept a vaccination. Furthermore, public attitudes of COVID-19 vaccination vary from gender and region. It is crucial for policy makers to adjust their policies through the use of positive incentives with prompt responses to pandemic-related news to promote vaccination acceptance.","Zhang, Zizheng; Feng, Guanrui; Xu, Jiahong; Zhang, Yimin; Li, Jinhui; Huang, Jian; Akinwunmi, Babatunde; Zhang, Casper J P; Ming, Wai-Kit",JMIR public health and surveillance,26,3

The virus that causes this disease is indicated originating from animals traded in a live animal market in Wuhan, China. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 can attack lung cells because there are many conserved receptor entries, namely Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2. The presence of this virus in host cells will initiate various protective responses leading to pneumonia and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. This review aimed to provide an overview related to this virus and examine the body's responses and possible therapies. Method We searched PubMed databases for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2, Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus. Full texts were retrieved, analyzed and developed into an easy-to-understand review. Results We provide a complete review related to structure, origin, and how the body responds to this virus infection and explain the possibility of an immune system over-reaction or cytokine storm. We also include an explanation of how this virus creates modes of avoidance to evade immune system attacks. We further explain the therapeutic approaches that can be taken in the treatment and prevention of this viral infection. Conclusion In summary, based on the structural and immune-evasion system of coronavirus, we suggest several approaches to treat the disease.","Astuti, Indwiani; Ysrafil,",Diabetes Metab Syndr,26,21

The study was designed to understand why older people might reject or accept the offer of seasonal flu vaccine, and in the course of the interviews respondents were also asked to express their views about the nature and causes of the two key illnesses. The latter are among the most common infections in human beings. In terms of the biomedical paradigm the common cold is caused by numerous respiratory viruses, whilst flu is caused by the influenza virus. Medical diagnosis is usually made on clinical grounds without laboratory confirmation. Symptoms of flu include sudden onset of fever and cough, and colds are characterized by sneezing, sore throat, and runny nose, but in practice the symptoms often overlap. In this study we examine the degree by which the views of lay people with respect to both diagnosis and epidemiology diverge with that which is evident in biomedical discourse. Our results indicate that whilst most of the identified symptoms are common to lay and professional people, the former integrate symptoms into a markedly different observational frame from the latter. And as far as causation is concerned it is clear that lay people emphasize the role of ‘resistance’ and ‘immunity’ at least as much as ‘infection’ in accounting for the onset of colds and flu. The data are analyzed using novel methods that focus on the co-occurrence of concepts and are displayed as semantic networks. As well as reporting on its findings the authors draw out some implications of the study for social scientific and policy discussions concerning lay diagnosis, lay expertise and the concept of an expert patient.","Prior, Lindsay; Evans, Meirion R.; Prout, Hayley",Soc Sci Med,26,16

The recognition by and activation of the innate immune response recruits neutrophils, which, through their different mechanisms of action, form extracellular neutrophil traps, playing a role in infection control and trapping viral, bacterial, and fungal etiological agents. However, in patients with COVID-19, activation at the vascular level, combined with other cells and inflammatory mediators, leads to thrombotic events and disseminated intravascular coagulation, thus leading to a series of clinical manifestations in cerebrovascular, cardiac, pulmonary, and kidney disease while promoting severe disease and mortality. Previous studies of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 have shown that elevated levels of markers specific for NETs, such as free DNA, MPO, and H3Cit, are strongly associated with the total neutrophil count; with acute phase reactants that include CRP, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, and interleukin secretion; and with an increased risk of severe COVID-19. This study analyzed the interactions between NETs and the activation pathways involved in immunothrombotic processes in patients with COVID-19.","Bautista-Becerril, Brandon; Campi-Caballero, Rebeca; Sevilla-Fuentes, Samuel; Hernández-Regino, Laura M.; Hanono, Alejandro; Flores-Bustamante, Al; González-Flores, Julieta; García-Ávila, Carlos A.; Aquino-Gálvez, Arnoldo; Castillejos-López, Manuel; Juárez-Cisneros, Armida; Camarena, Angel",Biomolecules,26,29

Methods: Systematic literature searches of PubMed, Scopus, and Embase database up until 9 December 2020. We include published observational prospective and retrospective studies with information on 25-OHD that reported main/secondary outcome. Low serum 25-OHD refers to participants with serum 25-OHD level below a cut-off point ranging from 20 to 30 ng/mL. Other cut-off values were excluded to reduce heterogeneity. The main outcome was mortality defined as non-survivor/death. The secondary outcome was susceptibility and severe COVID-19. Results: There were 14 studies comprising of 999,179 participants. Low serum 25-OHD was associated with higher rate of COVID-19 infection compared to the control group (OR = 2.71 [1.72, 4.29], p < 0.001; I(2): 92.6%).

IL-6 and NLRP3 inflammasome are the major immune components in immune responses stimulation upon pathogen infection. It's noteworthy that the function and expression of these components are remarkably influenced by non-coding RNAs including long non-coding RNAs. Given the potential role of these components in organ damage and pathological manifestations of patients infected with COVID-19, their blockage might be a hopeful and promising treatment strategy. Notably, more study on long non-coding RNAs involved in inflammatory responses could elevate the efficacy of anti-inflammatory therapy. In this review we discuss the potential impact of IL-6 and NLRP3 inflammasome blocker drugs on inflammatory responses, viral clearance, and pathological and clinical manifestations.

To date, there has been limited empirical investigation about thoughts of suicide and self‐harm during the COVID‐19 pandemic. METHODS: A national survey was conducted May 2020 to investigate the association between mental health symptoms, social isolation, and financial stressors during the COVID‐19 pandemic and thoughts of suicide and self‐harm. A total of 6607 US adults completed an online survey; survey criteria included an age minimum of 22 years old and reported annual gross income of $75,000 or below. Statistical raking procedures were conducted to more precisely weight the sample using US Census data on age, geographic region, sex, race, and ethnicity. RESULTS: COVID‐19‐related stress symptoms, loneliness, and financial strain were associated with thoughts of suicide/self‐harm in multivariable logistic regression analyses, as were younger age, being a military veteran, past homelessness, lifetime severe mental illness, current depressive symptoms, alcohol misuse, and having tested positive for COVID‐19. Greater social support was inversely related to thoughts of suicide/self‐harm whereas running out of money for basic needs (e.g., food), housing instability (e.g., delaying rent), and filing for unemployment or disability were positively related. CONCLUSIONS: Public health interventions to decrease risk of suicide and self‐harm in the wake of the COVID‐19 pandemic should address pandemic‐related stress, social isolation, and financial strain experienced including food insecurity, job loss, and risk of eviction/homelessness.","Elbogen, Eric B.; Lanier, Megan; Blakey, Shannon M.; Wagner, H.

In my view, these three papers have greatly impacted contemporary science and influenced development of policies that have limited the spread of hazardous contaminants. At the same time, a sobering reality is that reversing decades of past pollution has proven impossible in our lifetime, and global trends are dire for both legacy and emerging contaminants. Lessons in these papers are clear to most environmental scientists, but I argue have not resulted in adequate investment in infrastructure or manpower to enable systematic unbiased searching for pollutants as proposed by Sören Jensen in 1972.

Interestingly, recent studies demonstrated that platelets contain both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory molecules, equipping platelets with immunoregulatory function in both innate and adaptive immunity. In the context of infectious diseases, platelets are involved in early detection of invading microorganisms and are actively recruited to sites of infection. Platelets exert their effects on microbial pathogens either by direct binding to eliminate or restrict dissemination, or by shaping the subsequent host immune response. Reciprocally, many invading microbial pathogens can directly or indirectly target host platelets, altering platelet count or/and function. In addition, microbial pathogens can impact the host auto- and alloimmune responses to platelet antigens in several immune-mediated diseases, such as immune thrombocytopenia, and fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms that contribute to the bidirectional interactions between platelets and various microbial pathogens, and how these interactions hold relevant implications in the pathogenesis of many infectious diseases. The knowledge obtained from “well-studied” microbes may also help us understand the pathogenesis of emerging microbes, such as SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.","Li, Conglei; Li, June; Ni, Heyu",Front Immunol,26,16

In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between clinical course and inhospital mortality with parenteral administration of high-dose vitamin D(3) within the first 24 h of admission to patients who were hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU) because of COVID-19 with vitamin D deficiency. METHODS: This study included 175 COVID-19 patients with vitamin D deficiency [25(OH) D <12 ng/mL] who were hospitalized in the ICU. Vitamin D(3) group (n = 113) included patients who received a single dose of 300,000 IU vitamin D3 intramuscularly. Vitamin D(3) was not administered to the control group (n = 62). RESULTS: Median C-reactive protein level was 10.8 mg/dL in the vitamin D(3) group and 10.6 mg/dL in the control group (p = 0.465).

To do so, we use data on time spent by individuals on activities that would potentially expose them to crowds from the American Time Use Survey linked with state‐level data on positive tests from the COVID Tracking Project. We estimate count data specifications of observed COVID‐19 infections at the state level as a function of control demographic variables, and a measure of social distance that captures the amount of time individuals across the states spend in activities that potentially expose them to crowds. Parameter estimates reveal that the number of state‐level novel coronavirus infections decrease with respect to our measure of individual social distance. From a practical perspective, our parameter estimates suggest that if the typical individual in a U.S. state were to spend eight hours away from crowds completely, this would translate into approximately 240,000 fewer COVID‐19 infections across the states.

In particular, maturation of the gastrointestinal tract in a new environment loaded with potential pathogens, which can predispose neonatal calves to develop diarrhea, and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality during the first 4 wks of life. We aimed to investigate the inflammatory adaptations at a transcriptomic level in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract to a mild diarrhea in neonatal dairy calves using RNA isolated from fresh fecal samples. Eight newborn Jersey male calves were used from birth to 5 wks of age and housed in individual pens. After birth, calves received 1.9 L of colostrum from their respective dams. Calves had ad-libitum access to water and starter grain (22% CP) and were fed twice daily a total of 5.6 L pasteurized whole milk. Starter intake, body weight (BW), fecal score, withers height (WH), and rectal temperature (RT) were recorded throughout the experiment. Blood samples were collected weekly for metabolic and inflammatory profiling from wk 0 to wk 5. Fresh fecal samples were collected weekly and immediately flash frozen until RNA was extracted using a Trizol-based method, and subsequently, an RT-qPCR analysis was performed. Orthogonal contrasts were used to evaluate linear or quadratic effects over time. Starter intake, BW, and WH increased over time. Fecal score was greatest (2.6 ± 0.3) during wk 2. The concentrations of IL-6, ceruloplasmin, and haptoglobin had a positive quadratic effect with maximal concentrations during wk 2, which corresponded to the maximal fecal score observed during the same time. The concentration of serum amyloid A decreased over time. The mRNA expression of the proinflammatory related genes TLR4, TNFA, IL8, and IL1B had a positive quadratic effect of time.

These models, particularly positive matrix factorization (PMF), have been extensively used for analyzing particle number concentrations (PNCs) datasets. However, the variation of observed PNCs and particle size distribution are driven by both the source emission rates and atmospheric dispersion as well as chemical and physical transformation processes. This variation in the observation data caused by meteorologically induced dilution reduces the ability to obtain accurate source apportionment results. To reduce the influence of dilution on quantitative source estimates, a methodology for improving the accuracy of source apportionment results by incorporating a measure of dispersion, the ventilation coefficient, into the PMF analysis (called dispersion normalized PMF, DN-PMF) was applied to a PNC dataset measured from a field campaign that includes the Spring Festival event and the start of the COVID-19 lockdown in Tianjin, China. The data also included pollutant gases and hourly PM2.5 compositional data. Eight factors were resolved and interpreted as municipal incinerator, traffic nucleation, secondary inorganic aerosol (SIA), traffic emission, photonucleation, coal combustion, residential heating and festival emission. The DN-PMF enhanced the diel patterns of photonucleation and the two traffic factors by enlarging the differences between daytime peak values and nighttime concentrations. The municipal incinerator plant, traffic emissions, and coal combustion have cleaner and more clearly defined directionalities after dispersion normalization. Thus, dispersion normalized PMF is capable of enhancing the source emission patterns. After the COVID-19 lockdown began, PNC of traffic nucleation and traffic emission decreased by 41% and 44%, respectively, while photonucleation produced more particles likely due to the reduction in the condensation sink. The significant changes in source emissions indicate a substantially reduced traffic volume after the implement of lockdown measures.","Dai, Qili; Ding, Jing; Song, Congbo; Liu, Baoshuang; Bi, Xiaohui; Wu, Jianhui; Zhang, Yufen; Feng, Yinchang; Hopke, Philip K.",Sci Total Environ,26,0

The housing standards of nine European countries were compared to analyze their ability to satisfy new population need, in terms of size. The regulations were downloaded from the websites of the official channels of each country. A wide variability in room size was observed (e.g., single room: from 9 m(2) in Italy to 7 m(2) in France, to the absence of any limit in England and Wales, Germany-Hesse, and Denmark). Italian and French legislations define housing dimension considering the room destination and the number of people. The Swedish regulation provides performance requirements and functional indications but does not specify the minimum dimensions of habitable rooms. The rooms’ minimum heights vary between 2.70 m in Italy and Portugal and 2.60 m in the Netherlands, but no limits are established in England and Wales. A diverse approach among European countries regulations is observed: from a market-oriented logic one (e.g., England and Wales) in which room minimum dimensions are not defined to a prescriptive one (Italy) and one that is functionality-oriented (the Netherlands). However, considering the health, social, environmental, and economic trends, many of these standards should be revised.","Appolloni, Letizia; D’Alessandro, Daniela",Int J Environ Res Public Health,26,1

Identifying predictors for HIV status may facilitate targeted screening interventions that improve health care. We aimed at identifying HIV predictors as well as predicting persons at high risk of the infection. METHOD: We applied machine learning approaches for building models using population-based HIV Impact Assessment (PHIA) data for 41,939 male and 45,105 female respondents with 30 and 40 variables respectively from four countries in sub-Saharan countries. We trained and validated the algorithms on 80% of the data and tested on the remaining 20% where we rotated around the left-out country. An algorithm with the best mean f1 score was retained and trained on the most predictive variables. We used the model to identify people living with HIV and individuals with a higher likelihood of contracting the disease. RESULTS: Application of XGBoost algorithm appeared to significantly improve identification of HIV positivity over the other five algorithms by f1 scoring mean of 90% and 92% for males and females respectively. Amongst the eight most predictor features in both sexes were: age, relationship with family head, the highest level of education, highest grade at that school level, work for payment, avoiding pregnancy, age at the first experience of sex, and wealth quintile. Model performance using these variables increased significantly compared to having all the variables included. We identified five males and 19 females individuals that would require testing to find one HIV positive individual. We also predicted that 4·14% of males and 10.81% of females are at high risk of infection. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide a potential use of the XGBoost algorithm with socio-behavioural-driven data at substantially identifying HIV predictors and predicting individuals at high risk of infection for targeted screening.

Here, we use a reparameterized SIQRD network model that accounts for local political decisions to predict the spatiotemporal evolution of the pandemic in Germany at county resolution. Our optimized model reproduces state-wise cumulative infections and deaths as reported by the Robert Koch Institute and predicts the development for individual counties at convincing accuracy during both waves in spring and fall of 2020.

These mental health issues confronting young people are of public concern. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the associations between loneliness and gaming addiction behaviors among young people in Hong Kong and to investigate how familial factors, psychological distress, and gender differences moderate these relationships. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in June 2020 when schools reopened after 6 months of school closures. Participants included 2863 children and adolescents in primary (Grades 4 to 6) and secondary (Grades 7 and 8) schools (female participants: 1502/2863, 52.5%). Chi-square tests, one-way analyses of variance, and independent-samples t tests were performed to compare the differences of distribution in gaming addiction behaviors across gender, age, and other sociodemographic characteristics. Multinomial logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify factors that relate to excessive or pathological gaming behaviors separately, in comparison with leisure gaming. RESULTS: A total of 83.0% (2377/2863) of the participants played video games during the COVID-19 pandemic. The prevalence of excessive and pathological game addiction behaviors was 20.9% (597/2863) and 5.3% (153/2863), respectively. More male students had gaming addiction symptoms than female students. The multinomial logistic regressions showed that feeling lonely was associated with more problematic gaming behaviors, and the association was stronger for older female students. Low socioeconomic status, less parental support and less supervision, and poor mental health were risk factors for gaming addiction behaviors, especially among primary school students. CONCLUSIONS: Loneliness was associated with gaming addiction behaviors; the findings from this study suggested that this association was similar across gender and age groups among young people. Familial support and supervision during school closures can protect young people from developing problematic gaming behaviors. Results of this study have implications for prevention and early intervention on behalf of policy makers and game developers.","Zhu, Shimin; Zhuang, Yanqiong; Lee, Paul; Li, Jessica Chi-Mei; Wong, Paul W C",JMIR Serious Games,26,20

Acute psychological effects of quarantine in frail elderly subjects with special needs, such as patients with dementia, have been poorly investigated. The aim of this study was to assess modifications of neuropsychiatric symptoms during quarantine in patients with dementia and their caregivers. METHODS: This is a sub-study of a multicenter nation-wide survey. A structured telephone interview was delivered to family caregivers of patients with diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and vascular dementia (VD), followed regularly at 87 Italian memory clinics. Variations in behavioral and psychological symptoms (BPSD) were collected after 1 month since quarantine declaration and associations with disease type, severity, gender, and caregiver’s stress burden were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 4,913 caregivers participated in the survey. Increased BPSD was reported in 59.6% of patients as worsening of preexisting symptoms (51.9%) or as new onset (26%), and requested drug modifications in 27.6% of these cases. Irritability, apathy, agitation, and anxiety were the most frequently reported worsening symptoms and sleep disorder and irritability the most frequent new symptoms. Profile of BPSD varied according to dementia type, disease severity, and patients’ gender. Anxiety and depression were associated with a diagnosis of AD (OR 1.35, CI: 1.12–1.62), mild to moderate disease severity and female gender. DLB was significantly associated with a higher risk of worsening hallucinations (OR 5.29, CI 3.66–7.64) and sleep disorder (OR 1.69, CI 1.25–2.29), FTD with wandering (OR 1.62, CI 1.12–2.35), and change of appetite (OR 1.52, CI 1.03–2.25). Stress-related symptoms were experienced by two-thirds of caregivers and were associated with increased patients’ neuropsychiatric burden (p<0.0001). CONCLUSION: Quarantine induces a rapid increase of BPSD in approximately 60% of patients and stress-related symptoms in two-thirds of caregivers.

OBJECTIVE: To study the adrenocortical response to the acute COVID-19 infection METHODS: Morning plasma cortisol, ACTH and DHEAS were measured on day 1-2 of admission of 28 consecutive COVID-19 patients (16 males, 12 females, median age 45.5 years, range, 25-69). These tests were repeated twice in 20 patients and thrice in 15 patients on different days. The hormone levels were correlated with the severity of illness RESULTS: The median morning cortisol was 196 nmol/l (31-587). It was < 100 nmol/l in 8 patients (28.6%), < 200 nmol/l in 14 patients (50%) and < 300 nmol/l in 18 patients (64.3%). The corresponding ACTH values include a median of 18.5 ng/l (range 4-38), ACTH <10 ng/l in 7 patients (26.9%), < 20 ng/l in 17 patients (60.7%) and < 30 ng/l in 23 patients (82.1%). Repeated testing on different days showed a similar pattern. Overall, if a cutoff level of < 300 nmol/l is considered abnormal in the setting of acute illness, 9 patients (32%) had cortisol levels below this limit whether the test was done once only (3 patients) or three times (6 patients). The more severe the illness, the more patients with low cortisol and ACTH levels, suggesting a direct link between the COVID-19 infection and the impaired glucocorticoid response.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate pharmacists and pharmacy students’ awareness and source of their information regard the management of the coronavirus pandemic, and their perspective of their role during this emergent situation. METHODS: This descriptive cross-sectional online survey study was conducted in Jordan during the COVID-19 outbreak (from 15 to 30 March 2020). A validated online questionnaire addressing participants' current awareness about epidemics/pandemics and COVID-19, source of information and their perspectives of their role. Data were analyzed using statistical package for social science (SPSS). RESULTS: Participants (n = 726) had a mean age of 26.9 (8.0) years with 71.9% females. Pharmacy students made 35.3% of the sample while the rest were pharmacists.

Here, a fruitful flipped methodology with increased popularity can support adaption to and improvement of the current pandemic situation. This research presents a comparison of two different instruction situations with an identical teaching methodology, face-to-face (F2F) and face-to-screen (F2S) flipped methodology, in terms of students' performance and affective domain in a science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) course. It was considered and designed as an examination of 132 pre-service teachers (PSTs), with 68 and 64 PSTs respectively for each group. The first group before the pandemic was applied by F2F flipped classroom and the second group after the pandemic was applied by F2S flipped classroom. The results after pertaining various data analyses of class activities and questionaries showed that performance had been improved for both groups toward the course. In addition, F2F had a significant difference in PSTs' emotion and perception toward the course and made classes more interactive. The mean score values of students' emotion and perception between two groups showed that the difference between these mean values were significant, suggesting a very large effect. Particularly, the effect size (ES) showed that positive emotions were more significant with different variables and the items Q7–Q9 of questionnaires indicated more significant different perceptions for both F2F and F2S after completing the course. Finally, the principal component analysis (PCA) test described that F2F answers were located mainly in the positive emotion, while F2S answers were grouped in the negative emotion, while no differences were observed for PSTs perceptions to the flipped methodology. Consequently, although F2F–F2S transition was an effective process, instructors and PSTs faced difficulties in the platform usage for online lectures reflecting emotions' results in F2S group. Thus, by solving the problems raised, it will allow PSTs to be more interactive in a virtual and online context for their future implementation by giving them active instruction methodology and educating future students to teach STEM contents.","Jeong, Jin Su; González-Gómez, David",Front Psychol,26,1

However, many clinical practices have shown that traditional Chinese medicine has played an important role in treating the outbreak. Among them, ephedra-bitter almond is a common couplet medicine in anti-COVID-19 prescriptions. This study aims to conduct an exploration of key components and mechanisms of ephedra-bitter almond anti-COVID-19 based on network pharmacology. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We collected and screened potential active components of ephedra-bitter almond based on the TCMSP Database, and we predicted targets of the components. Meanwhile, we collected relevant targets of COVID-19 through the GeneCards and CTD databases. Then, the potential targets of ephedra-bitter almond against COVID-19 were screened out. The key components, targets, biological processes, and pathways of ephedra-bitter almond anti-COVID-19 were predicted by constructing the relationship network of herb-component-target (H-C-T), protein-protein interaction (PPI), and functional enrichment. Finally, the key components and targets were docked by AutoDock Vina to explore their binding mode. RESULTS: Ephedra-bitter almond played an overall regulatory role in anti-COVID-19 via the patterns of multi-component-target-pathway. In addition, some key components of ephedra-bitter almond, such as β-sitosterol, estrone, and stigmasterol, had high binding activity to 3CL and ACE2 by molecular docking simulation, which provided new molecular structures for new drug development of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Ephedra-bitter almonds were used to prevent and treat COVID-19 through directly inhibiting the virus, regulating immune responses, and promoting body repair. However, this work is a prospective study based on data mining, and the findings need to be interpreted with caution.

An extension of previous efforts in FERC Order 679 issued in 2006, the NOPR-proposed incentives would consist of up to 250 additional basis points of equity return to be allowed on qualifying transmission projects. The NOPR was published in the Federal Register on April 2, and public comments were due back to FERC by July 1. Such incentives, if adopted, would be helpful to address prior FERC business that is yet undone. Issued in 2011, FERC Order 1000, “Transmission and Cost Allocation by Transmission Owning and Operating Utilities” among other things envisioned coordinated planning of interregional transmission developments spanning between individual Regional Transmission Organizations (RTO) and Independent System Operators (ISO), the operators of the FERC-regulated organized wholesale markets. In addition to traditional goals of generator interconnection and service reliability, the purpose of such interregional transmission development was to support public policy goals including renewable energy development, and lower costs for consumers. But little or no such interregional development has happened since Order 1000. Why? The authors have spent the last several years promoting development of one such interregional transmission project. While the effort is ongoing, the on-the-ground experience to-date clearly shows the reasons why interregional development envisioned by FERC Order 1000 is not happening. The authors offer solutions to the issues, including how the new FERC NOPR for transmission incentives can be helpful.","Schulte, Robert H.; Fletcher, Fredric C.",The Electricity Journal,26,32

The large human lockdown and its eventual relaxation can be viewed as a Global Human Confinement Experiment. This experiment is a unique opportunity to identify positive and negative effects of human presence and mobility on a range of natural systems, including wildlife, and protected areas, and to study processes regulating biodiversity and ecosystems. We encourage ecologists, environmental scientists, and resource managers to contribute their observations to efforts aiming to build comprehensive global understanding based on multiple data streams, including anecdotal observations, systematic assessments and quantitative monitoring. We argue that the collective power of combining diverse data will transcend the limited value of the individual data sets and produce unexpected insights. We can also consider the confinement experiment as a “stress test” to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses in the adequacy of existing networks to detect human impacts on natural systems. Doing so will provide evidence for the value of the conservation strategies that are presently in place, and create future networks, observatories and policies that are more adept in protecting biological diversity across the world.","Bates, Amanda E.; Primack, Richard B.; Moraga, Paula; Duarte, Carlos M.",Biol Conserv,26,4

We analyzed the impact on number of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections and self-reported behavior change. Methods: In April 2020, a tele-coaching module and written summary about COVID-19, risk-reduction measures for prevention of COVID-19, and appropriate consultation of medical attention during the pandemic were integrated into an established tele-coaching program. Three hundred seventy-eight patients who had received both tele-coaching and written information 3 weeks earlier were interviewed using a structured questionnaire and compared with 1,748 patients who had only received written information at this point. Results: Tele-coaching had no short-term effect on numbers of SARS-CoV-2 infections. However, patients receiving tele-coaching reported significantly more behavioral changes, including increased room ventilation (88% vs. 78%, p < 0.0001), surface cleaning (80% vs. 70%, p = 0.0006), wearing of face masks (59% vs. 51%, p = 0.013), and reduced usage of public transport (77% vs. 68%, p = 0.0003), despite no observed difference in recall about risk-reduction measures. Moreover, tele-coaching improved patients' knowledge about how to seek medical help in an emergency (46% vs. 36%, p = 0.0006), with a significant reduction in self-reported doctors' appointments (304 vs. 413 per 1,000 patients, p = 0.002) and hospital visits (50 vs. 87 per 1,000, p = 0.033) during the first peak of the pandemic. Conclusion: In a population of patients with CHF at high risk of hospitalization, COVID-19-specific tele-coaching effectively supported behavioral changes and significantly reduced face-to-face medical contacts in a short-term follow-up period.","Knoll, Katharina; Leiter, Sarah M; Rosner, Stefanie; Trenkwalder, Teresa; Erben, Amadea; Kloss, Christian; Bregenhorn, Patrick; Schunkert, Heribert; Reinhard, Wibke",Telemed. j. e. health,26,10

Protecting the health of citizens is a central aim of sustainable development plans, due to the effect of health on social and economic development. However, studies show that environment-related diseases adversely affect the health status of a people, and this situation is worse for African countries. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) targets have included reducing environment-related deaths since 2015. However, there is a lack of empirical findings focused on the effects of environmental quality on life expectancy in Africa. OBJECTIVES. The present study examined the impact of environmental quality on life expectancy in 24 African countries. METHODS. Time-series data ranging from 2000 to 2016 was used and the panel autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL)–dynamic fixed effect (DFE) model was employed to analyze the data. RESULTS. The results confirmed that, in the long run, improvements in environmental quality significantly increased life expectancy in the studied African countries during the study period. A unit increment in environmental performance index (EPI) and ecosystem vitality (EV) increased the life expectancy of Africans by 0.137 and 0.1417 years, respectively. CONCLUSIONS. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first empirical (econometric) study using a broad measurement (indicator) of environmental quality to investigate its impact on life expectancy in African countries. The study recommends that the introduction of environmentally friendly economies (like renewable energy, land, water, and waste management), legal, socio-economic, demographic, and technological measures are essential to reduce environmental pollution and improve life expectancy in Africa.

On August 24, 2020, the spread of the virus in Morocco had caused more than 52,000 cases and 880 deaths. Cancer patients are more susceptible to develop an infection than people without cancer because of their immunosuppression caused by the disease and treatments (surgery and chemotherapy). Therefore, these patients are at higher risk of infection with COVID-19 and a much higher risk of developing more serious forms. Given this epidemiological context, the establishment of guidelines for patients with gynecological cancers, requiring multidisciplinary management during the global COVID-19 pandemic, is crucial to limit their infection while maintaining their chances for a cure. In this paper, we summarize the international COVID-19 recommendations on the prioritization of surgical cases, the perioperative protective measures, the precautions to be taken in the brachytherapy unit, the COVID-19 screening, and finally the therapeutic indications of gynecological cancers by tumor location.","Ismaili, Nabil; Elmajjaoui, Sanaa",SN Compr Clin Med,26,16

METHODS: We included 51,770 participants from a nationally representative, household-based health survey (PNS) conducted in Brazil. We estimated the proportion and number of adults (≥ 18 years) at risk of severe Covid-19 by sex, educational level, race/ethnicity, and state based on the presence of one or more of the following risk factors: age ≥ 65 years or medical diagnosis of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, chronic respiratory disease, cancer, stroke, chronic kidney disease and moderate to severe asthma, smoking status, and obesity. RESULTS: Adults at risk of severe Covid-19 in Brazil varied from 34.0% (53 million) to 54.5% (86 million) nationwide. Less-educated adults present a 2-fold higher prevalence of risk factors compared to university graduated. We found no differences by sex and race/ethnicity. São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, and Rio Grande do Sul were the most vulnerable states in absolute and relative terms of adults at risk. CONCLUSIONS: Proportion and total number of adults at risk of severe Covid-19 are high in Brazil, with wide variation across states and adult subgroups. These findings should be considered while designing and implementing prevention measures in Brazil. We argue that these results support broad social isolation measures, particularly when testing capacity for SARS-CoV-2 is limited.","Rezende, Leandro F.

Many subsequent papers have addressed its impact on health service utilization, but few have considered palliative (hospice) care. The aim of the present study was to describe changes in hospice inpatient utilization during and after the SARS epidemic in 2003 in Taiwan. METHODS: The data sources were the complete datasets of inpatient admissions during 2002 and 2003 from the National Health Insurance Research Database. Before-and-after comparisons of daily and monthly utilizations were made. Hospice analyses were limited to those wards that offered inpatient services throughout these two years. The comparisons were extended to total hospital bed utilization and to patients who were still admitted to hospice wards during the peak period of the SARS epidemic. RESULTS: Only 15 hospice wards operated throughout the whole of 2002 and 2003. In 2003, hospice utilization began to decrease in the middle of April, reached a minimum on 25 May, and gradually recovered to the level of the previous November. Hospices showed a more marked reduction in utilization than all hospital beds (e.g. -52.5% vs. -19.9% in May 2003) and a slower recovery with a three-month lag. In total, 566 patients were admitted to hospice wards in May/June 2003, in contrast to 818 in May/June 2002. Gender, age and diagnosis distributions did not differ. CONCLUSION: Hospice inpatient utilization in Taiwan was indeed more sensitive to the emerging epidemic than general inpatient utilization. A well-balanced network with seamless continuity of care should be ensured.","Chen, Tzeng-Ji; Lin, Ming-Hwai; Chou, Li-Fang; Hwang, Shinn-Jang",BMC Health Serv Res,26,20

The gammacoronaviruses primarily infect avian hosts. Within this genus of coronaviruses, the avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) causes a highly infectious upper-respiratory tract disease in commercial poultry. IBV shows rapid evolution in chickens, frequently producing new antigenic types, which adds to the multiple serotypes of the virus that do not cross protect. Rapid evolution in IBV is facilitated by strong selection, large population sizes and high genetic diversity within hosts, and transmission bottlenecks between hosts. Genetic diversity within a host arises primarily by mutation, which includes substitutions, insertions and deletions. Mutations are caused both by the high error rate, and limited proof reading capability, of the viral RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase, and by recombination. Recombination also generates new haplotype diversity by recombining existing variants. Rapid evolution of avian coronavirus IBV makes this virus extremely difficult to diagnose and control, but also makes it an excellent model system to study viral genetic diversity and the mechanisms behind the emergence of coronaviruses in their natural host.","Jackwood, Mark W.; Hall, David; Handel, Andreas",Infect Genet Evol,26,16

STUDY DESIGN: A virtual OHNS elective was created, with three components: (1) interactive virtual operating room (OR) experience using live-stream video-conferencing, (2) telehealth clinic, (3) virtual didactics. SETTING: OHNS Department at the University of Pennsylvania (May 2020 to June 2020). METHODS: Six medical students from the University of Pennsylvania; five attending otolaryngologists. Two surveys were designed and distributed to participating medical students and attending surgeons. Surveys included 5-point Likert scale items, with 1 indicating “not at all” and 5 indicating “very much so”. RESULTS: Response rate was 100% for both surveys. Students on average rated the educational value of the telehealth experience as 4.2±1.2, and the virtual OR experience as 4.0±0.6. Most students (n=5, 83%) indicated that they had enough exposure to faculty they met on this rotation to ask for a letter of recommendation (LOR) for residency if needed, while attending surgeons had an average response of 3.0±1.0 when asked how comfortable they would feel writing a LOR for a student they met through the rotation. A majority of students (n=4, 67%) felt they connected enough with faculty during the rotation to ask for mentorship. Half the students (n=5, 50%) indicated that the rotation allowed them to evaluate the department’s culture either “extremely well” or “somewhat well”.

However, many efforts have failed to identify a potentially universal trigger of KS. The contribution of the intestinal microbial community—called the “microbiota”—to KS has been evaluated by an increasing number of studies, though limited to small cohorts of patients. Differences in the microbiota composition were found in children with KS, both its acute and non-acute phase, with abnormal colonization by Streptococcus species in the intestinal tract and a wider presence of Gram-positive cocci in jejunal biopsies. In particular, a higher number of Gram-positive cocci (of the genera Streptococcus and Staphylococcus), Eubacterium, Peptostreptococcus, and HSP60-producing Gram-negative microbes have been found in the stools of KS children, and their effects on the antigenic repertoire of specific T cells and Vβ2 T cell expansion have been assessed. Conversely, Lactobacilli were lacking in most children with KS compared with other febrile illnesses and healthy controls. All studies available to date have confirmed that an imbalance in the gut microbiota might indirectly interfere with the normal function of innate and adaptive immunity, and that variable microbiota interactions with environmental factors, mainly infectious agents, might selectively drive the development of KS in genetically susceptible children. Further investigations of the intestinal microflora in larger cohorts of KS patients will provide clues to disentangle the pathogenesis of this disease and probably indicate disease-modifying agents or more rational KS-specific therapies.","Esposito, Susanna; Polinori, Ilaria; Rigante, Donato",Front Pediatr,26,27

Among them, quarantine, the closure of borders, and social distancing are the ones that have affected transportation systems most severely. With the clear need to avoid all unnecessary direct human contact, an increased interest in contactless transportation and delivery modes emerged. Drones are a promising alternative in this regard, especially for the delivery of essential goods, such as COVID-19 viral tests. In this study, we therefore investigate how drones can be used to distribute viral tests to potentially infected patients. The novel approach that we propose is to use existing drone infrastructure to perform this task, where drones owned and operated by different public and private entities are retrofitted for the distribution of essential goods in the case of emergency. In a wider sense, we hence suggest the establishment of a drone enabled back-up transport system. Potential performance gains are analyzed through a mathematical time and cost model that was developed in close cooperation with the state Red Cross Organization and a utility drone manufacturer. Process design as well as parameter estimation are based on empirical investigation including, but not limited to, accompanying a COVID-19 mobile testing team in the field.

Given the essential nature of community pharmacy as a health service, community pharmacies are unlikely to shut down in any foreseeable lockdown scenario. It is therefore important to assess the preventative measure directives for community pharmacies that are in place to safeguard community pharmacy personnel from SARS-CoV-2 in the various parts of the world. Upon reviewing the recommendations of 15 selected countries across five continents (Asia, Europe, Oceania, North America, and Africa) on social distancing and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) in community pharmacies, we found inconsistencies in the recommended social distance to be practiced within the community pharmacies. There were also varying recommendations on the use of PPE by the pharmacy personnel. Despite the differences in the recommendations, maintaining recommended social distance and the wearing of appropriate PPE is of utmost importance for healthcare workers, including community pharmacy personnel dealing with day-to-day patient care activities, though full PPE should be worn when dealing with suspected COVID-19 patients.","Hasan, Syed Shahzad; Kow, Chia Siang; Zaidi, Syed Tabish Razi",Res Social Adm Pharm,26,21

Despite improved understanding, the duration of host immunity following COVID-19 infection and role of serological testing alone or in addition to real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) testing in the HD population is not fully understood, which this study aimed to investigate. METHODS: There were two parts to this study. Between 15th March 2020 to 15th July 2020, patients receiving HD who tested positive on rRT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 were recruited into the COVID-19 arm, whilst asymptomatic patients without a previous diagnosis of COVID-19 were recruited to the epidemiological arm of the Salford Kidney Study (SKS). All patients underwent monthly testing for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies as per routine clinical practice since August 2020. The aims were twofold: firstly, to determine seroprevalence and COVID-19 exposure in the epidemiological arm; secondly, to assess duration of the antibody response in the COVID-19 arm. Baseline characteristics were reviewed between groups. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS. Mann-Whitney U and Chi-squared tests were used for testing significance of difference between groups. RESULTS: In our total HD population of 411 patients, 32 were PCR-positive for COVID-19. Of the remaining patients, 237 were recruited into the SKS study, of whom 12 (5.1%) had detectable anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Of the 32 PCR-positive patients, 27 (84.4%) were symptomatic and 25 patients admitted to hospital due to their symptoms. Of the 22 patients in COVID-19 arm that underwent testing for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies beyond 7 months, all had detectable antibodies. A higher proportion of the patients with COVID-19 were frail compared to patients without a diagnosis of COVID-19 (64.3% vs 34.1%, p = 0.003). Other characteristics were similar between the groups. Over a median follow up of 7 months, a higher number of deaths were recorded in patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 compared to those without (18.7% vs 5.9%, p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Serological testing in the HD population is a valuable tool to determine seroprevalence, monitor exposure, and guide improvements for infection prevention and control (IPC) measures to help prevent local outbreaks.

OBJECTIVE: We investigated the population-level internet search volume for telehealth (as a proxy of population interest and demand) with the number of new COVID-19 cases and the proportion of hospitals that adopted a telehealth system in all US states. METHODS: We used internet search volume data from Google Trends to measure population-level interest in telehealth and telemedicine between January 21, 2020 (when the first COVID-19 case was reported), and March 18, 2020. Data on COVID-19 cases in the United States were obtained from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resources Center.

Pearson correlation was used to examine the relations of population search volume for telehealth and telemedicine (composite score) with the cumulative numbers of COVID-19 cases in the United States during the study period and the proportion of hospitals with telehealth and tele-ICU capabilities. RESULTS: We found that US population–level interest in telehealth increased as the number of COVID-19 cases increased, with a strong correlation (r=0.948, P<.001). We observed a higher population-level interest in telehealth in the Northeast and West census region, whereas the proportion of hospitals that adopted telehealth was higher in the Midwest region. There was no significant association between population interest and the proportion of hospitals that adopted telehealth (r=0.055, P=.70) nor hospitals having tele-ICU capability (r=–0.073, P=.61). CONCLUSIONS: As the number of COVID-19 cases increases, so does the US population’s interest in telehealth. However, the level of population interest did not correlate with the proportion of hospitals providing telehealth services in the United States, suggesting that increased population demand may not be met with the current telehealth capacity. Telecommunication infrastructures in US hospitals may lack the capability to address the ongoing health care needs of patients with other health conditions. More practical investment is needed to deploy the telehealth system rapidly against the impending patient surge.","Hong, Young-Rock; Lawrence, John; Williams Jr, Dunc; Mainous III, Arch",JMIR Public Health Surveill,26,16

METHODS: A Guidance Committee and Readers Group were recruited. The content was identified by the Committee and content‐specific subgroups, resulting in a draft document, which was sent to the Readers for review. People with dementia and care partners were involved in all aspects of the process. RESULTS: Infection control measures can lead to an escalation of distress. In an environment where visiting bans are applied to care partners/advocates, hospitals need to ensure care partners can continue to provide decision‐making support. Health‐care professionals can proactively engage care partners using videoconferencing technologies. Developing models of care that proactively support best practice can minimise the risk of delirium, mitigate escalating symptoms and guide the use of non‐pharmacological, pharmacological (start low, go slow) or physical restraint in managing behavioural and psychological symptoms.","Martin‐Khan, Melinda; Bail, Kasia; Yates, Mark W.; Thompson, Jane; Graham, Fred",Australas J Ageing,26,18

We sought to evaluate the associations of 17 cardiometabolic traits with COVID-19 susceptibility and severity using 2-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We selected genetic variants associated with each exposure, including body mass index (BMI), at p < 5 × 10(−8) from genome-wide association studies (GWASs). We then calculated inverse-variance-weighted averages of variant-specific estimates using summary statistics for susceptibility and severity from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative GWAS meta-analyses of population-based cohorts and hospital registries comprising individuals with self-reported or genetically inferred European ancestry. Susceptibility was defined as testing positive for COVID-19 and severity was defined as hospitalization with COVID-19 versus population controls (anyone not a case in contributing cohorts). We repeated the analysis for BMI with effect estimates from the UK Biobank and performed pairwise multivariable MR to estimate the direct effects and indirect effects of BMI through obesity-related cardiometabolic diseases. Using p < 0.05/34 tests = 0.0015 to declare statistical significance, we found a nonsignificant association of genetically higher BMI with testing positive for COVID-19 (14,134 COVID-19 cases/1,284,876 controls, p = 0.002; UK Biobank: odds ratio 1.06 [95% CI 1.02, 1.10] per kg/m(2); p = 0.004]) and a statistically significant association with higher risk of COVID-19 hospitalization (6,406 hospitalized COVID-19 cases/902,088 controls, p = 4.3 × 10(−5); UK Biobank: odds ratio 1.14 [95% CI 1.07, 1.21] per kg/m(2), p = 2.1 × 10(−5)). The implied direct effect of BMI was abolished upon conditioning on the effect on type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, stroke, and chronic kidney disease. No other cardiometabolic exposures tested were associated with a higher risk of poorer COVID-19 outcomes. Small study samples and weak genetic instruments could have limited the detection of modest associations, and pleiotropy may have biased effect estimates away from the null. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found genetic evidence to support higher BMI as a causal risk factor for COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. These results raise the possibility that obesity could amplify COVID-19 disease burden independently or through its cardiometabolic consequences and suggest that targeting obesity may be a strategy to reduce the risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes.","Leong, Aaron; Cole, Joanne B.; Brenner, Laura N.; Meigs, James B.; Florez, Jose C.; Mercader, Josep M.",PLoS Med,26,21

Here we mapped 33 host protein interactions of CD81 in primary human liver and hepatoma cells using high-resolution quantitative proteomics. In the CD81 protein network, we identified five proteins which are HCV entry factors or facilitators including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Notably, we discovered calpain-5 (CAPN5) and the ubiquitin ligase Casitas B-lineage lymphoma proto-oncogene B (CBLB) to form a complex with CD81 and support HCV entry. CAPN5 and CBLB were required for a post-binding and pre-replication step in the HCV life cycle. Knockout of CAPN5 and CBLB reduced susceptibility to all tested HCV genotypes, but not to other enveloped viruses such as vesicular stomatitis virus and human coronavirus. Furthermore, Plasmodium sporozoites relied on a distinct set of CD81 interaction partners for liver cell entry. Our findings reveal a comprehensive CD81 network in human liver cells and show that HCV and Plasmodium highjack selective CD81 interactions, including CAPN5 and CBLB for HCV, to invade cells.","Bruening, Janina; Lasswitz, Lisa; Banse, Pia; Kahl, Sina; Marinach, Carine; Vondran, Florian W.; Kaderali, Lars; Silvie, Olivier; Pietschmann, Thomas; Meissner, Felix; Gerold, Gisa",PLoS Pathog,26,6

The mucosal exudation process involves ‘flooding’ of the lamina propria with plasma‐derived binding proteins and it is possible that subepithelial inflammatory cytokines and mediators may be moved by the exudate to the mucosal surface. In this study, we have analysed cytokine levels in nasal lavage (NAL) fluids from non‐allergic subjects inoculated with coronavirus (n= 20) and from subjects with allergic (birch pollen) rhinitis subjected to additional allergen challenge (samples were obtained 35min post challenge) in the laboratory (n= 10). Ten of the 20 inoculated subjects developed common cold and 10 remained healthy. Interferon‐γ (IFN‐γ), interleukin‐1β (IL‐1β), granulocyte‐macrophage colony‐stimulating factor (GM‐CSF), IL‐4, and IL‐6 were analysed in unprocessed NAL fluids using immunoassays. The subjects who developed common cold had increased NAL fluid levels of IFNγ (P < 0.05) that correlated well with the symptoms (P < 0.001). IFNγ did not increase in subjects with allergic rhinitis. IL‐1β levels were similar in NAL fluids obtained from all inoculated subjects. In the subjects with allergic rhinitis NAL fluid levels of both IL‐1β and GM‐CSF were increased (P < 0.05). GM‐CSF was not detected in common cold. IL‐4 and IL‐6 were not detectable in any of the NAL fluids. The present cytokines may not only emanate from superficial mucosal cells. By aiding plasma exudation subepithelial cytokines may potentially also be retrieved on the mucosal surface. Our study provides original in vivo data supporting the notion that a TH‐1 profile of cytokines, notably IFNγ, is present in viral infection and further supporting the view that GM‐CSF is an important cytokine in allergic airways disease.","LINDEN, M.; GREIFF, L.; ANDERSSON, M.; SVENSSON, C.; ÅKERLUND, A.; BENDE, M.; ANDERSSON, E.; PERSSON, C.

This paper constructed a comprehensive evaluation index system for urban resilience under the COVID-19 pandemic scenario considering four dimensions—economy, ecology, infrastructure, and social systems—conducted a quantitative evaluation of urban resilience in the Yangtze River Delta of China, revealed its spatiotemporal differences and change trends, and proposed targeted strategies for improving urban resilience. The results show that (1) the Yangtze River Delta urban resilience system is growing stronger every year, but there are significant differences in the level of urban resilience, its spatial distribution and regional urban resilience. (2) In the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration, there is less distribution of areas with a higher resilience index, while those with high and medium resilience levels are more distributed. However, the resilience of most cities is low. (3) The resilience index of eastern coastal cities is significantly higher, and the resilience of cities under the COVID-19 scenario presents obvious east–west differentiation. (4) When constructing urban resilience, the individual situation of cities should be taken into account, measures adjusted according to local conditions, reasonable lessons drawn from effective international urban resilience construction, and reasonable planning policies formulated; it is important to give play to the relationship between the whole and the parts of resilience to achieve unified and coordinated development.","Chen, Xiansheng; Quan, Ruisong",Nat Hazards (Dordr),26,9

Patients often develop severe complications and have high mortality rates. The cycle threshold (Ct) value derived from nasopharyngeal swab samples using real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) may be a useful prognostic marker in hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, however, its role in predicting the course of the pandemic has not been evaluated thus far. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study which included all patients who had a nasopharyngeal sample positive for SARS-CoV-2 between April 4 –June 5, 2020. The Ct value was used to estimate the number of viral particles in a patient sample. The trend in initial viral load on admission on a population level was evaluated. Moreover, patient characteristics and outcomes stratified by viral load categories were compared and initial viral load was assessed as an independent predictor of intubation and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: A total of 461 hospitalized patients met the inclusion criteria. This study consisted predominantly of acutely infected patients with a median of 4 days since symptom onset to PCR. As the severity of the pandemic eased, there was an increase in the percentage of samples in the low initial viral load category, coinciding with a decrease in deaths. Compared to an initial low viral load, a high initial viral load was an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality (OR 5.5, CI 3.1–9.7, p < 0.001) and intubation (OR 1.82 CI 1.07–3.11, p = 0.03), while an initial intermediate viral load was associated with increased risk of inpatient mortality (OR 1.9, CI 1.14–3.21, p = 0.015) but not with increased risk for intubation. CONCLUSION: The Ct value obtained from nasopharyngeal samples of hospitalized patients on admission may serve as a prognostic marker at an individual level and may help predict the course of the pandemic when evaluated at a population level.","El Zein, Said; Chehab, Omar; Kanj, Amjad; Akrawe, Sandy; Alkassis, Samer; Mishra, Tushar; Shatta, Maya; El-Hor, Nivine; Salimnia, Hossein; Chandrasekar, Pranatharthi",PLoS One,26,17

Amongst these, the broadly neutralising antibodies and peptide lectins are promising in that they can immediately act on the virus and have proven efficacious in in vitro and in vivo protection studies. For the purpose of development and access by the relevant population groups, it is crucial that these microbicides be produced at low cost. For the promising protein and peptide candidate molecules, it appears that current production systems are overburdened and expensive to establish and maintain.

Due to recent reports, vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCov-19 (developed by Oxford and AstraZeneca) may result in a vaccine-induced catastrophic thrombotic thrombocytopenia disorder. Thus, as of March 16 of 2021, vaccination programs in 18 countries had been suspended until further examination, including Sweden, Germany and France. This disorder presents as extensive thrombosis in atypical sites, primarily in the cerebral venous, alongside thrombocytopenia and the production of autoantibody against platelet-factor 4 (PF4). PF4 autoantibody has the ability to binds the human FcRγIIA receptor of platelets and contribute to their aggregation. This rare adverse effect extremely resembles the clinical presentation of the classical immune-mediated HIT disorder, which occurs following exposure to heparin. Surprisingly, none of these patients had been pre-exposed to heparin before disease onset, leading to the hypothesis that a viral antigen from the vaccine had triggered the response. Importantly, COVID-19 had been associated with numerous autoimmune manifestations, including the production of pathogenic autoantibodies, new onset of autoimmune diseases and disorders. As the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccination leads to the synthesis of specific SARS-CoV-2-proteins, they may trigger a production of PF4 autoantibody though molecular mimicry phenomena, while vaccination compounds lead to a rigorous bystander activation of immune cells. If existing, removing such homological sequences from the vaccine may eliminate this phenomenon. In contrast, it needs to be emphasized that the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine was found to be safe and efficacious against symptomatic COVID-19 in randomized controlled trials, which included 23,848 participants from the UK, Brazil and South Africa.","Dotan, Arad; Shoenfeld, Yehuda",J Autoimmun,26,27

Despite the vast research about the adult population, there has been little data collected on acute kidney injury (AKI) epidemiology, associated risk factors, treatments, and mortality in pediatric COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU. AKI is a severe complication of COVID-19 among children and adolescents. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed/MEDLINE and Cochrane Center Trials to find all published literature related to AKI in COVID-19 patients, including incidence and outcomes. RESULTS: Twenty-four studies reporting the outcomes of interest were included. Across all studies, the overall sample size of COVID positive children was 1,247 and the median age of this population was 9.1 years old. Among COVID positive pediatric patients, there was an AKI incidence of 30.51%, with only 0.56% of these patients receiving KRT. The mortality was 2.55% among all COVID positive pediatric patients. The incidence of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) among COVID positive patients was 74.29%. CONCLUSION: AKI has shown to be a negative prognostic factor in adult patients with COVID-19 and now also in the pediatric cohort with high incidence and mortality rates.

Furthermore, emotional exhaustion was related to greater levels of personal distress and greater levels of inferences of mental states. Depersonalization was associated with greater levels of personal distress and lower levels of empathic concern. Personal accomplishment was associated with the inference of mental states in patients, lower levels of personal distress, and perspective-taking.

The importance of PF is evident already in early ages, as children’s PF appears to be a key factor of their future PF and physical activity level. Among the variables that may have an influence on children’s PF, the importance of parent’s socioeconomic status and active/inactive behaviors has been stressed in several previous studies. However, previous literature has mostly reported this association through cross-sectional studies. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of parental education and self-reported parental physical activity (PA) on their children’s development of PF during the 4-year duration of primary education. Using German Motor Test 6-18, the major components of PF (sprint velocity, coordination, flexibility, strength endurance, power, and endurance) were measured on a total of 371 children (46.9% girls, 30.6% migration background, 19.6% overweight/obese at the fourth test time point, compliance 70.1%) from 20 primary schools in Tyrol, Austria. Results showed that children with at least one parent with upper secondary education or above obtained significantly higher PF scores at all time points compared to children with both parents with lower secondary education and below. However, PF in both groups developed over time in a comparable manner irrespective of parental education. From the age of 9 years old, children with regularly physically active parents showed a stronger development of PF over the time compared to their peers with parents reporting irregular/no PA. Our results suggest that low-educated parents’ children might be considered a special target group for interventions aiming at increasing PF. More research is needed in order to delve into the potential underdevelopment of PF in 9-year-old children whose parents have low PA levels.","Ruedl, Gerhard; Niedermeier, Martin; Wimmer, Lukas; Ploner, Vivien; Pocecco, Elena; Cocca, Armando; Greier, Klaus",Int J Environ Res Public Health,26,21

Deep learning models, in particular variants of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been studied for ILI (Influenza-Like Illness) forecasting, and have achieved a higher forecasting skill compared to conventional models such as ARIMA. In this study, we adapt two neural networks that employ one-dimensional temporal convolutional layers as a primary building block—temporal convolutional networks and simple neural attentive meta-learners—for epidemiological forecasting. We then test them with influenza data from the US collected over 2010-2019. We find that epidemiological forecasting with CNNs is feasible, and their forecasting skill is comparable to, and at times, superior to, plain RNNs. Thus CNNs and RNNs bring the power of nonlinear transformations to purely data-driven epidemiological models, a capability that heretofore has been limited to more elaborate mechanistic/compartmental disease models.","Lee, Kookjin; Ray, Jaideep; Safta, Cosmin",PLoS One,26,24

We aimed to investigate the consequences of these restrictions on informal (family, friends) and formal (homecare staff) resource utilization among co-residing (e.g., spouses) and visiting caregivers (e.g., children). METHODS: 105 PwD (≥65 years old) and their caregivers were included in the prospective PANdemic in DEMentia (PAN.DEM) study, which was initiated when the ongoing stepped-wedge, cluster randomized LIVE@Home.Path trial (N = 438) was temporarily halted due to the pandemic. Primary outcome was change in resource utilization assessed by the Resource Utilization in Dementia Care (RUD) instrument in pre- (12 Dec. 2019 to 11 Mar. 2020) and during the lockdown periods (20 April 2020 to 15 May 2020). Degree of cognitive impairment was assessed by Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE), and physical functioning and independent living skills by Physical Self-Maintenance Scale and Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale. Associations between informal and formal care utilization, socio-demographics, and clinical variables were assessed by descriptive statistics and Ordinary Least Squares models (OLS). RESULTS: Mean age for PwD was 81.8 years; 61% were female; 45.6% lived alone, and the mean MMSE score was 20.8 (SD ± 3.7). PwD with co-residents (44%) were younger (78.4 years) than those who were living alone (84.5 years; P < 0.001). During the first 2 months of lockdown, PwD missed on average 20.5 h of formal care in a month (P < 0.001) leading to an approximately 100% increase in informal care, which was particularly pronounced in personal hygiene (6.9 vs. 11.4 days in a month, P < 0.001) and supervision (9.2 vs. 17.6 days in a month; P < 0.001). Visiting caregivers increased by 1.9 days (SD ± 11.5), but co-residing caregivers increased their number of days providing ADL by approximately 7 days per month (β = 6.9; CI, 0.39–13.1, P < 0.05) after adjusting for PwD and caregiver demographics and clinical variables. Decrease in home nursing care was particularly visible for PwD living alone (− 6.1 vs. -1.3 h per month, P = 0.005). Higher cognitive function (β = − 0.64, CI, − 1.26 – 0.02, P = 0.044) was associated with reduction in home nursing service during the lockdown. CONCLUSION: The care situation for PwD changed dramatically in the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially for those living alone who received less support from homecare services and visiting caregivers. For future crises and the forthcoming post-pandemic period, health authorities must plan better and identify and prioritize those in greatest need.

The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV spike (S) protein is an important target in developing safe and effective SARS vaccines. Our previous study has demonstrated that vaccination with adeno-associated virus encoding RBD (RBD-rAAV) induces high titer of neutralizing antibodies. In this study, we further assessed the immune responses and protective effect of the immunization with RBD-rAAV prime/RBD-specific T cell peptide boost, as compared to those of vaccinations with RBD-rAAV and RBD-peptides alone. Our results indicated that RBD-rAAV prime/RBD-peptide boost induced similar Th1 and neutralizing antibody responses, but stronger Th2 and CTL responses than RBD-rAAV prime/boost. The resulting immune responses protected the vaccinated mice from subsequent SARS-CoV challenge, which was evidenced by lower level of viral replication in mouse lung tissues. However, no significant immune responses and protective effect were detected in mice vaccinated with RBD-peptides or blank AAV alone. Since T cell epitopes are highly conserved and boosting with peptides may induce the production of effector memory T cells, our results suggest that the vaccination protocol used may be ideal for providing effective, universal and long-term protection against SARS-CoV infection.","Du, Lanying; Zhao, Guangyu; Lin, Yongping; Chan, Chris CS; He, Yuxian; Jiang, Shibo; Wu, Changyou; Jin, Dong-Yan; Yuen, Kwok-Yung; Zhou, Yusen; Zheng, Bo-Jian",Vaccine,26,15

Unlike the developed countries where burials are usually conducted as private ceremonies, funerals in Africa are elaborate and are usually public ceremonies involving the entire members of families, friends and well-wishers. Religion and culture are usually the deciding factors when decisions are made on how the deceased should be buried but generally cremation is not commonly practiced in Africa. COVID-19 pandemic was generally accepted to originate from Wuhan in China and this pandemic has extended to Africa. Most countries in Africa responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by adopting the same strategies used by the Western countries in curbing the spread of the virus through the imposition of restrictions on movements, lock down and the introduction social distancing rules which are align to Africa way of living. These control strategies had put a lot of pressures on the weak mortuary services in Africa, altered the traditional methods of observing burial rites, mourning and grieving. COVID-19 pandemic has changed the various traditional ways Africans mourn grief and bury their love one.

METHODS: Using an interrupted time series design, we analyzed psychiatric presentations using electronic health record data in an academic medical center ED between 2018 and 2020. We used regression models to assess the association between the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak and certain psychiatric presentations. The period February 26–March 6, 2020 was used to define patterns in psychiatric presentations before and after the coronavirus outbreak. RESULTS: We found a 36.2% decrease (unadjusted) in ED psychiatric consults following the coronavirus outbreak, as compared to the previous year. After accounting for underlying trends, our results estimate significant differential change associated with suicidal ideation and substance use disorder (SUD) presentations following the outbreak. Specifically, we noted a significant differential increase in presentations with suicidal ideation six weeks after the outbreak (36.4 percentage points change; 95% CI: 5.3, 67.6). For presentations with SUD, we found a differential increase in the COVID-19 time series relative to the comparison time series at all post-outbreak time points and this differential increase was significant three weeks (32.8 percentage points; 95% CI: 4.0, 61.6) following the outbreak.

While anyone can be infected by the virus, the presence of certain chronic diseases has been shown to exacerbate the severity of the infection. There is a likelihood that knowledge of this information may lead to negative psychological impacts among people with chronic illness. We hypothesized that the pandemic has resulted in increased levels of anxiety and depression symptoms among people with chronic illness. We recruited 540 participants from the ongoing Prospective Urban and Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study in British Columbia, Canada. Participants were asked to fill out an online survey that included the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS) to assess anxiety and depression symptoms. We tested our hypothesis using bivariate and multivariable linear regression models. Out of 540 participants, 15% showed symptoms of anxiety and 17% reported symptoms of depression. We found no significant associations between having a pre-existing chronic illness and reporting higher levels of anxiety or depression symptoms during COVID-19. Our results do not support the hypothesis that having a chronic illness is associated with greater anxiety or depression symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic.

To characterize the in vivo replication and dissemination of rVSV vectors in mice, high doses of a highly attenuated vector expressing HIV-1 Gag, rVSV(IN)- N4CT9-Gag1, and a prototypic reference virus, rVSV(IN)-HIVGag5, were delivered intramuscularly (IM), intranasally (IN), or intravenously (IV). We used quantitative, real-time RT-PCR (Q-PCR) and standard plaque assays to measure the temporal dissemination of these viruses to various tissues. Following IM inoculation, both viruses were detected primarily at the injection site as well as in draining lymph nodes; neither virus induced significant weight loss, pathologic signs, or evidence of neuroinvasion. In contrast, following IN inoculation, the prototypic virus was detected in all tissues tested and caused significant weight loss leading to death. IN administration of rVSV(IN)- N4CT9-Gag1 resulted in detection in numerous tissues (brain, lung, nasal turbinates, and lymph nodes) albeit in significantly reduced levels, which caused little or no weight loss nor any mortality. Following IV inoculation, both prototypic and attenuated viruses were detected by Q-PCR in all tissues tested. In contrast to the prototype, rVSV(IN)-N4CT9-Gag1 viral loads were significantly lower in all organs tested, and no infectious virus was detected in the brain following IV inoculation, despite the presence of viral RNA.

Also, the model is used to determine differentiated changes to the reinfection rate for different interventions such as reductions in activity participation, the wearing of masks, or contact tracing followed by quarantine-at-home. One important result is that successful contact tracing reduces the reinfection rate by about 30 to 40%, and that if contact tracing becomes overwhelmed then infection rates immediately jump up accordingly, making rather strong lockdown measures necessary to bring the reinfection rate back to below one.","MuÌller, S.
