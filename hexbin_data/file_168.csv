1919,"Improving health aid for a better planet: The planning, monitoring and evaluation tool (PLANET)",2015-08-19,"BACKGROUND: International development assistance for health (DAH) quadrupled between 1990 and 2012, from US$ 5.6 billion to US$ 28.1 billion. This generates an increasing need for transparent and replicable tools that could be used to set investment priorities, monitor the distribution of funding in real time, and evaluate the impact of those investments. METHODS: In this paper we present a methodology that addresses these three challenges. We call this approach PLANET, which stands for planning, monitoring and evaluation tool. Fundamentally, PLANET is based on crowdsourcing approach to obtaining information relevant to deployment of large–scale programs. Information is contributed in real time by a diverse group of participants involved in the program delivery. FINDINGS: PLANET relies on real–time information from three levels of participants in large–scale programs: funders, managers and recipients. At each level, information is solicited to assess five key risks that are most relevant to each level of operations. The risks at the level of funders involve systematic neglect of certain areas, focus on donor’s interests over that of program recipients, ineffective co–ordination between donors, questionable mechanisms of delivery and excessive loss of funding to “middle men”. At the level of managers, the risks are corruption, lack of capacity and/or competence, lack of information and /or communication, undue avoidance of governmental structures / preference to non–governmental organizations and exclusion of local expertise. At the level of primary recipients, the risks are corruption, parallel operations / “verticalization”, misalignment with local priorities and lack of community involvement, issues with ethics, equity and/or acceptability, and low likelihood of sustainability beyond the end of the program’s implementation. INTERPRETATION: PLANET is intended as an additional tool available to policy–makers to prioritize, monitor and evaluate large–scale development programs. In this, it should complement tools such as LiST (for health care/interventions), EQUIST (for health care/interventions) and CHNRI (for health research), which also rely on information from local experts and on local context to set priorities in a transparent, user–friendly, replicable, quantifiable and specific, algorithmic–like manner.","Sridhar, Devi; Car, Josip; Chopra, Mickey; Campbell, Harry; Woods, Ngaire; Rudan, Igor",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4544236/,168

6412,Whose world? Which health? What security? The facts and fictions of global health security,2013-02-12,"Kawasaki disease (KD) is a systemic vasculitis of unknown etiology. The laboratory findings before and after intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in KD have been discussed, but the characteristics of IVIG therapy still are unclear. This study aimed to compare laboratory data from patients with KD and enterovirus (EV) infection to evaluate the differences after IVIG therapy. The study enrolled 171 KD patients and 38 EV patients treated with a single dose of IVIG from 2003 to 2010. Laboratory data including total white blood cell counts (WBC) and hemoglobin (Hb), platelet, segment, lymphocyte, eosinophil, and monocyte levels were analyzed. Compared with the KD patients, the EV patients had higher Hb, lymphocyte, and monocyte levels and lower eosinophil levels before IVIG treatment (p < 0.05). After IVIG treatment, the KD patients had lower Hb and segment levels but higher platelet, lymphocyte, and eosinophil levels than the EV patients (p < 0.05). In the KD patients, the platelet, eosinophil, and monocyte levels increased after IVIG treatment, whereas Hb, WBC, and segment levels decreased significantly (p < 0.001). In the EV patients, eosinophil levels increased after IVIG treatment, whereas WBC and Hb levels decreased significantly (p < 0.05). The study results provide evidence that eosinophilia may be related to IVIG therapy in KD and EV patients. The KD patients had higher eosinophil levels both before and after IVIG therapy than the EV patients, which may have been due to the inflammatory mechanism of KD. The KD patients had higher platelet levels than the EV patients, suggesting that platelets are involved in the inflammatory response to KD.","Lin, Li-Yan; Yang, Tsung-Hsien; Lin, Ying-Jui; Yu, Hong-Ren; Yang, Kuender D.; Huang, Yi-Chuan; Chang, Wei-Chiao; Kuo, Ho-Chang",Pediatr Cardiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7100730/,168

10841,"Whose crisis? Pandemic flu, ‘communication disasters’ and the struggle for hegemony",2019-11-20,"BACKGROUND: In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF), non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is generally recommended and has proven its benefits by reducing endotracheal intubation (ETI) rates, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, complications, and mortality. Choosing between immediate ETI or NIV trial is often difficult when such patients present with an altered mental status. Some guidelines recommend avoiding NIV when consciousness is impaired given the risk of aspiration, and some authors suggest that a pH < 7.25 is highly predictive of NIV failure. Though clinical response to a well-adjusted NIV treatment can be both swift and spectacular, these contraindications probably encourage physicians to proceed to immediate ETI. Some studies indeed report that NIV was not even considered in as many as 60% of patients who might have benefited from this therapy, though ETI related complications might have been avoided had NIV been successfully applied. CASE PRESENTATION: We report two cases of ARF in COPD patients who were successfully treated by NIV in prehospital setting and avoided ETI despite contraindications (altered mental status with a Glasgow Coma Scale < 8) and failure risk factors (severe respiratory acidosis with pH < 7.25). CONCLUSION: In COPD patients presenting ARF, NIV trial could be considered even when relative contraindications such as an altered level of consciousness or a severe respiratory acidosis are present.","Fubini, PE; Suppan, L",Int J Emerg Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206709/,168

In this study, we sought to characterize the capsid proteins of filamentous N. gonorrhoeae bacteriophage NgoΦ6 and phagemids propagated in different bacteria. The data demonstrate that purified phage contain phage-encoded structural proteins and bacterial host proteins; host proteins consistently copurified with the phage particles. The bacterial host proteins associated with the phage filament (as identified by mass spectrometry) tended to be one of the predominant outer membrane components of the host strain, plus minor additional host proteins. We were able to copurify a functional ß-lactamase, a phagemid-encoded protein, with phage filaments. We used protein modeling and immunological analysis to identify the major phage encoded structural proteins. The antigenic properties of these proteins depended on the bacterium where the phages were propagated. Polyclonal antibodies against N. gonorrhoeae phage NgoΦ6 recognized phage-encoded proteins if the phage was propagated in N. gonorrhoeae or H. influenzae cells but not if it was propagated in Salmonella or E. coli. We show that the phage filaments isolated from gonococci and Haemophilus are glycosylated, and this may explain the antigenic diversity seen. Taken en toto, the data demonstrate that while the neisserial filamentous phage are similar to other Inovirus with respect to overall genomic organization, their ability to closely associate with host proteins suggests that they have unique surface properties and are secreted by a here-to-fore unknown secretory pathway.","Piekarowicz, A.; Kłyż, A.; Adamczyk-Popławska, M.; Stein, D.

17725,Artist’s Statement: Behind the Same Mask,2021-05-25,"Background: Ureaplasma urealyticum (UU) infection is the most common cause of male infertility. Zhibai Dihuang Decoction (ZBDHD) can improve the rate of forwarding motility sperm, sperm deformity rate, seminal plasma zinc and refined berry sugar levels. Methods: The potential targets of ZBDHD are obtained from The Encyclopedia of Traditional Chinese Medicine (ETCM). Orchitis-related targets were collected from the Genecards and OMIM databases. The Cytoscape and the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) were utilized to construct and analyzed the networks. Finally, a rat model of orchitis caused by UU infection was used to detect related indicators of mitochondrial energy metabolism using TUNEL apoptosis detection technology, loss cytometry, Real-Time Quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western Blot. Results: A total of 795 ZBDHD targets and 242 orchitis-related targets were obtained. The “ZBDHD- orchitis PPI network” was constructed and analyzed. ZBDHD can regulate signaling pathways and biological processes related to mitochondrial energy metabolism. The results of experimental studies have shown that ZBDHD maintains the integrity of sperm mitochondrial respiratory chain function by enhancing mitochondrial Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase and Ca2(+)-Mg(2+)-ATPase activities, promotes the synthesis of mitochondrial ATP, and improves sperm energy supply, thereby improving the motility, vitality and survival rate of sperm, and effectively improving the quality of semen in UU-infected rats (p < 0.05). Conclusion:This study discovered the multi-pathway mechanism of ZBDHD intervention in UU-induced orchitis through integrated pharmacological strategies, which provides a reference for further research on the mechanism of ZBDHD intervention in orchitis in the direction of mitochondrial energy metabolism.","Bin, Dong-hua; Zhang, Shi-ying; Zhan, Min; Li, Ling; Li, Ying-qiu; Zhou, Xing; Lu, Fang-guo; Zhou, Qing; He, Qing-hu",Front Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8141734/,168
17995,A Systematic Review and Quality Appraisal of Applications of Direct Instruction with Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder,2021-06-01,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In this review, we report on the state of knowledge about human Q fever in Brazil and on the Guiana Shield, an Amazonian region located in northeastern South America. There is a contrast between French Guiana, where the incidence of this disease is the highest in the world, and other countries where this disease is practically non-existent. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent findings are essentially in French Guiana where a unique strain MST17 has been identified; it is probably more virulent than those usually found with a particularly marked pulmonary tropism, a mysterious animal reservoir, a geographical distribution that raises questions. SUMMARY: Q fever is a bacterial zoonosis due to Coxiella burnetii that has been reported worldwide. On the Guiana Shield, a region mostly covered by Amazonian forest, which encompasses the Venezuelan State of Bolivar, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, and the Brazilian State of Amapá, the situation is very heterogeneous. While French Guiana is the region reporting the highest incidence of this disease in the world, with a single infecting clone (MST 117) and a unique epidemiological cycle, it has hardly ever been reported in other countries in the region. This absence of cases raises many questions and is probably due to massive under-diagnosis. Studies should estimate comprehensively the true burden of this disease in the region.","Epelboin, Loïc; Eldin, Carole; Thill, Pauline; de Santi, Vincent Pommier; Abboud, Philippe; Walter, Gaëlle; Melzani, Alessia; Letertre-Gibert, Paule; Perez, Lucas; Demar, Magalie; Boutrou, Mathilde; Fernandes, Jorlan; Cermeño, Julman Rosiris; Panizo, Maria Mercedes; Vreden, Stephen GS; Djossou, Félix; Beillard, Emmanuel; de Waard, Jacobus H.; de Lemos, Elba Regina Sampaio",Curr Trop Med Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8169413/,168
18624,Non-invasive ventilation versus high-flow nasal oxygen for postextubation respiratory failure in ICU: a post-hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial,2021-06-28,"BACKGROUND: The Gram-negative intracellular bacterium Mycoplasma anatis is a pathogen of respiratory infectious diseases in ducks and has caused significant economic losses in the poultry industry. OBJECTIVE: This study, as the first report of the structure and function of the pan-genome of Mycoplasma anatis, may provide a valuable genetic basis for many aspects of future research on the pathogens of waterfowl. METHODS: We sequenced the whole genomes of 15 Mycoplasma anatis isolated from ducks in China. Draft genome sequencing was carried out and whole-genome sequencing was performed by the sequencers of the PacBio Sequel and an IonTorrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM). Then the common genic elements of protein-coding genes, tRNAs, and rRNAs of Mycoplasma anatis genomes were predicted by using the pipeline Prokka v1.13.7. To investigate homologous protein clusters across Mycoplasma anatis genomes, we adopted Roary v3.13.0 to cluster orthologous genes (OGs) based on the following criteria. RESULTS: We obtained one complete genome and 14 genome sketches. Microbial mobile genetic element analysis revealed the distribution of insertion sequences (IS30, IS3, and IS1634), prophage regions, and CRISPR arrays in the genome of Mycoplasma anatis. Comparative genomic analysis decoded the genetic components and functional classification of the pan-genome of Mycoplasma anatis that comprised 646 core genes, 231 dispensable genes and among them 110 was strain-specific. Virulence-related gene profiles of Mycoplasma anatis were systematically identified, and the products of these genes included bacterial ABC transporter systems, iron transport proteins, toxins, and secretion systems. CONCLUSION: A complete virulence-related gene profile of Mycoplasma anatis has been identified, most of the genes are highly conserved in all strains. Sequencing results are relevant to the molecular mechanisms of drug resistance, adaptive evolution of pathogens, population structure, and vaccine development.

Our review aimed to evaluate the efficacy of QE for alleviating fatigue. Methods: A related literature search was performed in the PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, China Biology Medicine disc (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang, and VIP data bases from inception to November 2020. Information on fatigue, malaise, tiredness, and Qigong research data was collected. Results: Sixteen randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were reported in patients with cancer (n = 4), chronic fatigue syndrome (n = 2), and other diseases (n = 10). The QE groups showed significant improvements in total fatigue intensity [15 RCTs, p < 0.00001; standard mean difference (SMD) −0.69 (−0.95 to −0.44)]. The QE groups did not show significant improvement in quality of life [4 RCTs, p = 0.08; SMD 0.53 (−0.07 to 1.14)]. The statistically significant difference of the subgroup analyses (different primary diseases, QE types, and study quality) also remained unchanged. Conclusion: The findings of this meta-analysis indicate that QE may be beneficial for improving fatigue in patients diagnosed with various diseases. Considering the limitations of the study, we draw a very cautious conclusion regarding the resulting estimate of the effect. Further studies are warranted to better understand the benefits of QE in primary medical care.","Wang, Rui; Huang, Xueyan; Wu, Yeqi; Sun, Dai",Front Med (Lausanne),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8257957/,168
22185,Section II: Poster Sessions,2007-11-29,"Studies in recent years show that the delivery process, the choice of delivery mode, and the delivery outcome of primiparas are affected by their mental state. With the transformation of the medical model from the single biomedical model to the biopsychosocial medical model, the influence of social psychological factors on maternal psychological state has aroused heated discussion among clinical scholars. In this study, 480 cases of normal primiparas who had regular prenatal examination and delivered in hospital were selected as the research object. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD) was used to record the depressive anxiety state of all study subjects in the third trimester, and we analyzed the effects of age, education background of pregnant women and their spouses, the nature of jobs, family income, prenatal and pregnancy health status, medical insurance status, attend pregnant women's school, and accompanying status of family member on their depressive anxiety state. The influence of depression and anxiety on delivery mode was analyzed. The result showed that the age, health status during prenatal and pregnancy, accompanying status of family members, and attend pregnant women's school are the independent risk factors affecting depression and anxiety status of primiparas during late pregnancy. Antenatal depression and anxiety have certain influence on the choice of the delivery mode of pregnant women. Targeted psychological intervention for primiparas with high-risk factors is helpful to improve their psychological state and reduce the rate of cesarean section.","Chen, Xingying; Hong, Fangfang; Wang, Dandan; Bai, Bingyan; Xia, Yue; Wang, Chenjie",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8505059/,168
22550,Examining the Links between Biodiversity and Human Health: An Interdisciplinary Research Initiative at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,2007-02-07,"BACKGROUND: Despite recognition that hospitalized patients carry pathogens on their hands and demonstrate poor hand hygiene practice, little attention has been given to interventions that increase hand hygiene practices. Studies that have attempted to improve patient hand hygiene practice lack sustainability due to dependability on healthcare staff, and no prior studies have tested ways to improve independent patient hand hygiene practice. One such approach is using a patient-centered multi-modal educational intervention and electronic voice-recorded reminder cue to promote self- management of hand hygiene. METHODS: This comparative effectiveness study tested two educationally-based approaches to improve patient hand hygiene in older adults hospitalized for 4 days for elective lower extremity orthopedic or podiatry surgery at a veterans’ hospital. Group 1 (n = 41) received an educational video, an educational handout and a voice-recorded electronic audio reminder (EAR) an active cue, which verbally reminded the participant to clean their hands 3 times a day (7am, 12 pm, 5pm). Group 2 (n = 34) received the educational video and handout without the EAR. There were no significant differences between the two randomly assigned groups in terms of age, ethnicity and sex. RESULTS: Figure 1 shows the daily difference in product consumption Day 0 to Day 3. The average product consumption of ABHR (alcohol-based hand rub) in Group 1 (EAR) was 29.97 grams (SD 17.13). Group 2 (No EAR) averaged 10.88 grams (9.27) (P < 0.0001). Comparing post-operative day (POD) 0 to POD 3, and controlling for covariates (Disability of Arm, Shoulder, and Hand [QuickDASH], Hand Grip Strength, Surgical Pain, MRSA in Nares, and Education), multivariate analyses indicated that the electronic audio reminder was a significant predictor (β=.468) of ABHR consumption, R(2) = .39, R(2)adj. = .34, F (6, 68) = 7.265, P < .001. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that a short educational intervention that included a video, a handout, and a verbal audio reminder has the potential to increase patient-centered infection prevention in the acute care settings without increasing the workload of healthcare workers. Findings can be used for future infection prevention studies in institutionalized patients to improve self-managed care.

The sensitivity of antigen assays is rather low. A combination of PCR and detection of infectivity increase the detection rate.Among the main respiratory viruses only influenza is preventable by vaccination.The annual revaccination of the elderly and patients with risk factors such as chronic cardiopulmonary diseases is important.Improved vaccines can enhance the immunoreaction.For therapy and prophylaxis against influenza A amantadine may be used.The neuraminidase inhibitors zanamivir and oseltamivir represent potent drugs for antiviral therapy against influenza virus A and B infection.

25819,Policy Innovations for Health,2008-09-26,"Nanobiotechnology as a “converged” technological platform (CT = Converging Technologies) is discussed in relation to discourse within civil society. The conflicts and ethical debates surrounding nanobiotechnology can be intuited from these larger discursive frames of reference. Complimenting Glimell and Fogelberg's (2003) research documenting an emergent epistemic culture amongst scientists researching and working on nanotechnologies, and more recent research on the multiple meanings of nanotechnology in the political economy (Wullweber, 2007), this paper traces an emergent ethnography of engaged actors within civil society as they develop discursive and mobilization repertoires. Whilst on occasion ambivalent about the combination of specific promises and risks in relation to nanobiotechnology, in general a broad critique of the politics of technology is emerging as a counter epistemology or “Master Frame” (Snow & Benford, 1992) amongst certain predisposed UK civil society groups. Converging Technologies provide the issue around which this broad critique is solidifying. Thus whilst many of the specific risks raised by nanobiotechnology (and other CT) are definitively new, many of the p?tential risks and grievances, have been raised before in relation to other issues of scientific and environmental controversy, often by the same actor groups. Thus convergence is a useful metaphor for appreciating that broader frame of reference from within which the emerging conflicts and ethical debates about nanobiotechnology are being situated. If you go ten, fifteen years in the future, you're not going to be able to distinguish between what's nano technology, what's bio technology, what's information technology or what's genetic engineering. They're all going to be the same kind of technologies … just employed in different ways and different places.

Despite the practical importance, there have been little epidemiological and laboratory methods that were proposed to determine the end of an epidemic. This short review was aimed to systematically discuss methodological principles of a small number of existing techniques and understand their advantages and disadvantages. Existing epidemiological methods have been mostly limited to a single-and-brief exposure setting, while the application to human-to-human transmissible disease epidemic with stochastic dependence structure in the observed case data has remained to be a statistical challenge. In veterinary applications, a large-scale sampling for laboratory testing has been commonly adapted to substantiate a freedom from disease, but such study has only accounted for binomial sampling process in estimating the error probability of elimination.

Our facility focuses on using bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) to identify precise risk factors and determine the causative pathogen of ARDS within 24 h of intensive care unit (ICU) admission. This study evaluated the prognoses of pathogen-proven ARDS patients who were diagnosed or identified with risk factors using a diagnostic protocol, which included BAL, compared with the prognoses of pathogen-unproven ARDS patients. METHODS: This retrospective observational study was conducted in the ICU at a tertiary hospital from October 2015 to January 2019. We enrolled patients with respiratory distress who were on mechanical ventilation for more than 24 h in the ICU and who were subjected to our diagnostic protocol. We compared the disease characteristics and mortality rates between pathogen-proven and pathogen-unproven ARDS patients. RESULTS: Seventy ARDS patients were included, of whom, 50 (71%) had pathogen-proven ARDS as per our protocol. Mortality rates in both the ICU and the hospital were significantly lower among pathogen-proven ARDS patients than among pathogen-unproven ARDS patients (10% vs. 50%, p = 0.0006; 18% vs. 55%, p = 0.0038, respectively). Pathogen-proven ARDS patients were independently associated with hospital survival (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.238; 95% confidence interval, 0.096–0.587; p = 0.0021). CONCLUSIONS: Our diagnostic protocol, which included early initiation of BAL, enabled diagnosing pathogen-proven ARDS in 71% of ARDS patients. These patients were significantly associated with higher hospital survival rates. The diagnostic accuracy of our diagnostic protocol, which includes BAL, remains unclear.","Kyo, Michihito; Hosokawa, Koji; Ohshimo, Shinichiro; Kida, Yoshiko; Tanabe, Yuko; Shime, Nobuaki",J Intensive Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7376525/,168
38551,HEALTH: Coronavirus Hotspots,2020-08-20,"BACKGROUND: In critically ill children, omitting early use of parenteral nutrition (late-PN versus early-PN) reduced infections, accelerated weaning from mechanical ventilation, and shortened PICU stay. We hypothesized that fasting-induced ketogenesis mediates these benefits. METHODS: In a secondary analysis of the PEPaNIC RCT (N = 1440), the impact of late-PN versus early-PN on plasma 3-hydroxybutyrate (3HB), and on blood glucose, plasma insulin, and glucagon as key ketogenesis regulators, was determined for 96 matched patients staying ≥ 5 days in PICU, and the day of maximal 3HB-effect, if any, was identified. Subsequently, in the total study population, plasma 3HB and late-PN-affected ketogenesis regulators were measured on that average day of maximal 3HB effect. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard and logistic regression analyses were performed adjusting for randomization and baseline risk factors. Whether any potential mediator role for 3HB was direct or indirect was assessed by further adjusting for ketogenesis regulators. RESULTS: In the matched cohort (n = 96), late-PN versus early-PN increased plasma 3HB throughout PICU days 1–5 (P < 0.0001), maximally on PICU day 2. Also, blood glucose (P < 0.001) and plasma insulin (P < 0.0001), but not glucagon, were affected. In the total cohort (n = 1142 with available plasma), late-PN increased plasma 3HB on PICU day 2 (day 1 for shorter stayers) from (median [IQR]) 0.04 [0.04–0.04] mmol/L to 0.75 [0.04–2.03] mmol/L (P < 0.0001). The 3HB effect of late-PN statistically explained its impact on weaning from mechanical ventilation (P = 0.0002) and on time to live PICU discharge (P = 0.004). Further adjustment for regulators of ketogenesis did not alter these findings. CONCLUSION: Withholding early-PN in critically ill children significantly increased plasma 3HB, a direct effect that statistically mediated an important part of its outcome benefit.","De Bruyn, Astrid; Gunst, Jan; Goossens, Chloë; Vander Perre, Sarah; Guerra, Gonzalo G.; Verbruggen, Sascha; Joosten, Koen; Langouche, Lies; Van den Berghe, Greet",Crit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7456767/,168

However, the relationship between EVD68 and host cells remains unclear. Caspases are involved in cell death, immune response, and even viral production. We found that caspase-3 was activated during EVD68 replication to induce apoptosis. Caspase-3 inhibitor (Z-DEVD-FMK) inhibited viral production, protected host cells from the cytopathic effects of EVD68 infection, and prevented EVD68 from regulating the host cell cycle at G0/G1. Meanwhile, caspase-3 activator (PAC-1) increased EVD68 production. EVD68 infection therefore activates caspase-3 for virus production. This knowledge provides a potential direction for the prevention and treatment of disease related to EVD68.","Huo, Wenbo; Yu, Jinghua; Liu, Chunyu; Wu, Ting; Wang, Yue; Meng, Xiangling; Song, Fengmei; Zhang, Shuxia; Su, Ying; Liu, Yumeng; Liu, Jinming; Yu, Xiaoyan; Hua, Shucheng",J Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7459088/,168

Here, we will discuss the application of the powerful tools of systems biology to decode the molecular mechanisms that determine risk for infection and subsequent asthma. An important conceptual advance is the understanding that the innate immune system is governed by a Bow-tie architecture, where diverse input signals converge onto a few core pathways (e.g., IRF7), which in turn generate diverse outputs that orchestrate effector and regulatory functions. Molecular profiling studies in children with severe exacerbations of asthma/wheeze have identified two major immunological phenotypes. The IRF7hi phenotype is characterised by robust upregulation of antiviral response networks, and the IRF7lo phenotype is characterised by upregulation of markers of TGFβ signalling and type 2 inflammation. Similar phenotypes have been identified in infants and children with severe viral bronchiolitis. Notably, genome-wide association studies supported by experimental validation have identified key pathways that increase susceptibility to HRV infection (ORMDL3 and CHDR3) and modulate TGFβ signalling (GSDMB, TGFBR1, and SMAD3). Moreover, functional deficiencies in the activation of type I and III interferon responses are already evident at birth in children at risk of developing febrile lower respiratory tract infections and persistent asthma/wheeze, suggesting that the trajectory to asthma begins at birth or in utero. Finally, exposure to microbes and their products reprograms innate immunity and provides protection from the development of allergies and asthma in children, and therefore microbial products are logical candidates for the primary prevention of asthma.","Read, James F.; Bosco, Anthony",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7503410/,168

METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out with 205 older adults from a primary healthcare unit of the Federal District, Brazil. The cardiovascular risk was determined by the Framingham Risk Score (FRS). The National Cholesterol Evaluation Program for Adult Treatment Panel III 2001 (NCEP-ATP III) criteria were considered to analyze metabolic syndrome (MS) diagnoses. RESULTS: There was a strong association between MS and high cardiovascular risk (OR = 8.86). The univariate analysis main findings revealed that male gender, diabetes, smoking habit, systolic blood pressure, HDL level, high blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin, and LDL level were associated with high cardiovascular risk. FRS increases significantly with the presence of four or more MS components (by 30%, if 4 components are present, and by 40%, if 5 components) when compared with the presence of three or fewer components (P <0.001). A logistic regression analysis of high-risk predictors was described to reduce the effects of confounding and bias factors. CONCLUSION: The identification of MS associated with high FRS values represents a cascading of adverse effects on the population’s aging process.","Gustavo de Sousa Barbalho, Yuri; Morato Stival, Marina; Ramos de Lima, Luciano; Cristina Rodrigues da Silva, Izabel; de Oliveira Silva, Alessandro; Vieira Gomes da Costa, Manoela; Cristina Morais Santa Barbara Rehem, Tania; Schwerz Funghetto, Silvana",Clin Interv Aging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7513792/,168

RESULTS: Most of the studies provide an insight into the possible role of gut microbes during lung diseases including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, lung cancer, and other respiratory problems such as allergy and asthma. However, clinical evidence underlying gut-lung crosstalk during respiratory viral infections is limited.

44183,Investigating the effects of COVID-19 and public health expenditure on global supply chain operations: an empirical study,2021-01-06,"BACKGROUND: The Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2 assay (Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, Illinois) is an RT-PCR test for qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in NP and OP specimens performed on the Abbott m2000 System. Currently, no published data exists on the performance characteristics of the assay. METHODS: Denver Health Medical Center (DHMC) is a 550-bed hospital that is Denver County’s safety net institution. The Department of Pathology and Laboratory Services at DHMC provides testing for both inpatient and outpatient populations. In March 2020, we validated the Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2 assay. Beginning March 19, inpatients and outpatients with SARS-CoV-2 symptoms were tested. On April 22, universal testing began on admitted patients, regardless of symptoms, and on May 2, testing began on asymptomatic outpatients prior to time-sensitive procedures. We evaluated the sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) for tests done March 19 through June 16 using a surrogate method. False negative (FN) results: patients with an initial negative test then a positive test within 7 or 14 days. True negative (TN) results: patients with two initial consecutive negative tests within 7 or 14 days. True positive (TP) results: patients with an initial positive test. RESULTS: There were 16,152 tests done for 13,673 patients. Test results are shown in Table 1. Sensitivity for 7 and 14 days was 99.1% and 97.6%, respectively. The NPV for 7 and 14 days was 94.7% and 91.4%, respectively. Table 1 [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: There are limitations to our analysis. First, our assumption of no false positives may be incorrect. Although PCR assays are known to have a low false positive rate, the rate likely is not zero, but in the absence of a true gold standard comparator, we could not calculate test specificity. Second, testing asymptomatic patients may artificially inflate the TN results and the NPV. Third, results depend on the quality of specimen collection, preservation, transport, and handling. We believe accounting for repeat testing in a short timeframe lends credibility to the sensitivity and NPV results. Without published gold standard data on SARS-CoV-2 testing, infection can be reliably ruled both in and out using this assay. Providers can confidently use the results to make clinical and infection prevention management decisions.

To service today’s increased data requirements, networks management must be revolutionised so as to proactively respond to anomalies quickly and efficiently. To equip the network with resilience, a distributed design calls for node agency, so that nodes can predict the emergence of critical data loads leading to disruptions. This is to inform prognostics models and proactive maintenance planning. Proactive maintenance needs KPIs, most importantly probability and impact of failure, estimated by criticality which is the negative impact on connectedness in a network resulting from removing some element. In this paper, we studied criticality in the sense of increased incidence of data congestion caused by a node being unable to process new data packets. We introduce three novel, distributed measures of criticality which can be used to predict the behaviour of dynamic processes occurring on a network. Their performance is compared and tested on a simulated diffusive data transfer network. The results show potential for the distributed dynamic criticality measures to predict the accumulation of data packet loads within a communications network. These measures are predicted to be useful in proactive maintenance and routing for telecommunications, as well as informing businesses of partner criticality in supply networks.","Proselkov, Yaniv; Herrera, Manuel; Parlikad, Ajith Kumar; Brintrup, Alexandra","Service Oriented, Holonic and Multi-Agent Manufacturing Systems for Industry of the Future",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7980859/,168

This paper presents a novel, context-aware, deep-learning-driven, Persian sentiment analysis approach. Specifically, the proposed deep-learning-driven automated feature-engineering approach classifies Persian movie reviews as having positive or negative sentiments. Two deep learning algorithms, convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long-short-term memory (LSTM), are applied and compared with our previously proposed manual-feature-engineering-driven, SVM-based approach. Simulation results demonstrate that LSTM obtained a better performance as compared to multilayer perceptron (MLP), autoencoder, support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression and CNN algorithms.","Dashtipour, Kia; Gogate, Mandar; Adeel, Ahsan; Larijani, Hadi; Hussain, Amir",Entropy (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8151596/,168

Elevated protein kinase CK2 level and activity have been historically observed in HNSCC cells. Previous studies on CK2 in HNSCC did not generally include consideration of HPV(+) and HPV(−) status. Here, we investigated the response of HPV(+) and HPV(−) HNSCC cells to CK2 targeting using CX-4945 or siRNA downregulation combined with cisplatin treatment. HNSCC cell lines were examined for CK2 expression levels and activity and response to CX-4945, with and without cisplatin. CK2 levels and NFκB p65-related activity were high in HPV(+) HNSCC cells relative to HPV(−) HNSCC cells. Treatment with CX-4945 decreased viability and cisplatin IC50 in all cell lines. Targeting of CK2 increased tumor suppressor protein levels for p21 and PDCD4 in most instances. Further study is needed to understand the role of CK2 in HPV(+) and HPV(−) HNSCC and to determine how incorporation of the CK2-targeted inhibitor CX-4945 could improve cisplatin response in HNSCC.","Trembley, Janeen H.; Li, Bin; Kren, Betsy T.; Gravely, Amy A.; Caicedo-Granados, Emiro; Klein, Mark A.; Ahmed, Khalil",Biomedicines,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8158385/,168

Vaccine hesitancy may be fueled by health information obtained from a variety of sources, including new media such as the Internet and social media platforms. As access to technology has improved, social media has attained global penetrance. In contrast to traditional media, social media allow individuals to rapidly create and share content globally without editorial oversight. Users may self-select content streams, contributing to ideological isolation. As such, there are considerable public health concerns raised by anti-vaccination messaging on such platforms and the consequent potential for downstream vaccine hesitancy, including the compromise of public confidence in future vaccine development for novel pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2 for the prevention of COVID-19. In this review, we discuss the current position of social media platforms in propagating vaccine hesitancy and explore next steps in how social media may be used to improve health literacy and foster public trust in vaccination.","Puri, Neha; Coomes, Eric A; Haghbayan, Hourmazd; Gunaratne, Keith",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2020.1780846; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32693678/,168

OBJECTIVE To determine the probability of finding round spermatids suitable for ROSI in men with non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) in whom no spermatozoa were retrieved at testicular sperm extraction. MATERIALS AND METHODS Four-hundred fifty-seven consecutive men with azoospermia underwent testicular sperm extraction. Clinical examination included age, secondary sexual characteristics, testicular size, reproductive hormone estimation, karyotyping and Y chromosome microdeletion analyses. Histologic examination was performed and histologic classification was determined by the most advanced spermatogenetic cell identified in the combined histologic and cytologic examination. RESULTS Of the 457 azoospermic men, 342 were diagnosed with NOA and 148 (148/342, 43%) had mixed atrophy on histopathology and retrievable spermatozoa. No spermatozoa were found in 194/342 men with NOA (57%).

We investigated the possible relationship between CRP-to-albumin ratio (CAR) and presence and progression of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). The study included 150 patients previously diagnosed with AAA (diameter 40-54 mm) and 100 normal controls. Clinical and laboratory parameters and maximal cross-sectional AAA diameters (measured by computed tomography angiography) were obtained from all participants at baseline assessment as well as after 1 year for those with an AAA. The patients with AAA had significantly higher serum CAR compared with controls at baseline (P < .001). Increased serum CAR was found to be an independent predictor of the presence of AAA (odds ratio: 3.162, 95% CI: 1.690-5.126, P = .001) after multivariate logistic regression analysis. There was a significant increase in aortic diameter and CAR after 1 year in the patients with AAA (P < .001; P = .003); a significant correlation was found between changes in the diameter of AAAs and CAR (r = 0.414; P = .005).

SETTING Large tertiary care health system in the Bronx, NY, USA. METHODS We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 4613 SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive patients admitted between March 10, 2020, and May 11, 2020. We examined in-hospital intubation, acute kidney injury (AKI), hospitalization length, and in-hospital mortality by HIV serostatus, and by HIV-viral suppression and CD4 counts among people living with HIV (PLWH) using adjusted competing risks regression. We also compared immune and inflammatory marker levels by HIV serostatus and viral suppression. RESULTS Most patients were either non-Hispanic Black (36%) or Hispanic (37%); 100/4613 (2.2%) were PLWH, among whom 15 had detectable HIV viral load. PLWH compared to patients without HIV had increased intubation rates (adjusted hazard ratio 1.73 [95% CI: 1.12 to 2.67], P = 0.01). Both groups had similar rates of AKI, length of hospitalization, and death. No (0%) virally unsuppressed PLWH were intubated or died, versus 21/81 (26%, P = 0.04) and 22/81 (27%, P = 0.02) of virally suppressed PLWH, respectively. Among PLWH, higher CD4 T-cell counts were associated with increased intubation rates. C-reactive protein, IL-6, neutrophil counts, and ferritin levels were similar between virally suppressed PLWH and patients without HIV, but significantly lower for unsuppressed PLWH (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS PLWH had increased risk of intubation but similarly frequent rates of AKI and in-hospital death as those without HIV. Findings of no intubations or deaths among PLWH with unsuppressed HIV viral load warrant further investigation.","Patel, Viraj V; Felsen, Uriel R; Fisher, Molly; Fazzari, Melissa J; Ginsberg, Mindy S; Beil, Robert; Akiyama, Matthew J; Anastos, Kathryn; Hanna, David B",Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes,https://doi.org/10.1097/qai.0000000000002578; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33433966/,168

Specimens were collected between January and November 2018, from patients ≥18 years of age, and had a culture performed as part of standard of care testing. The BFPP identified a viral or bacterial target in 117/200 (58.5%) samples, including Staphylococcus aureus in 22% of samples and Haemophilus influenzae in 14%, and both a viral and bacterial target in 4% of samples. The most common viruses detected by BFPP were rhinovirus/enterovirus (4.5%), influenza A (3%), and RSV (2%). Overall, there was strong correlation between BFPP and standard methods for detection of viruses (99.2%) and bacteria (96.8%). Most bacteria (60/61 [98.4%]) detected by standard methods were also identified by BFPP; and 92 additional bacteria were identified by BFPP alone, including 22/92 (23.9%) additional S. aureus and 25/92 (27.2%) H. influenzae, which were more frequently discordant when detected at low concentrations (S. aureus, p<0.001; H. influenzae, p<0.0001) and in sputum-type specimens (S. aureus, p<0.05). A potential limitation of the BFPP assay is the absence of fungal targets and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, which were detected in 26 and 4 of 200 specimens, respectively. Real-time specimen analysis with BFPP has the potential to identify bacterial pathogens and resistance markers 44.2 and 56.3 h faster than culture-based methods.

We aimed to evaluate whether SP affects time course and twitches' values of an acceleromyographic assessed neuromuscular block with or without previous tetanic stimulation. Fifty adult patients were randomized to receive a 50 Hz tetanic stimulus (S group) or not (C group) before monitor calibration. After 20 min of TOF ratio (TOFr) stimulation rocuronium was administered. Onset time of block (primary endpoint), recovery of T1 to 25%, TOFr to 0.9, and recovery index were compared. We also compared T1 and TOFr at baseline, post-stimulation, and during recovery from block. Moreover the correlation between T1 at maximum recovery and (a) baseline T1 and (b) post-stimulation T1 along with T1/TOFr ratio during recovery were evaluated. After stimulation median T1 increased (32%) in group C and decreased (16%) in group S (P = 0.0001). Onset time (Median [IQR] in seconds) was 90 (29-77) vs. 75 (28-60) in C and S group (P = 0.002). Time [Mean (SD) in minutes] to normalized TOFr 0.9 were 70.13 (14.9) vs. 62.1 (21.2) in C and S groups (P = 0.204). TOFr showed no differences between groups at any time point. T1 at maximum recovery showed a stronger correlation with post-stabilization T1 compared to baseline. (ρ = 0.80 and ρ = 0.85, for C and S groups.) Standard calibration does not ensure twitch baseline stabilization and prolongs onset time of neuromuscular block.

Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is frequently used intraoperatively in man to provide information regarding cerebral perfusion. OBJECTIVES To determine whether NIRS can identify trends in regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) in horses and whether there is a correlation between rSO2 and venous oxygen tensions. METHODS A cerebral oximeter sensor recorded rSO2 from the dorsal sagittal sinus of 6 healthy horses. Values for rSO2, arterial and venous oxygen and carbon dioxide tensions (PaO2, PvO2, PaCO2 and PvCO2 respectively), along with arteriovenous oxygen saturations (SavO2) were recorded in unsedated (recording period [RP] 1), sedated (RP2) and anaesthetised horses (RP3-5) and during recovery (RP6-8). During anaesthesia, horses were ventilated to achieve states of normo- (RP3), hyper- (RP4) and hypocapnoea (RP5). Data were evaluated descriptively and analysed using linear mixed-effects models and Pearson's correlation coefficient. RESULTS Overall mean ± s.d. values for rSO2, PaO2, PvO2, PaCO2, SavO2 and mean arterial pressure varied significantly by RP (P<0.001). Significant decreases in rSO2 were identified between RP1 and the post anaesthetic periods (P<0.001). No significant differences in rSO2 values were identified between RP1 and the intra-anaesthesia periods or between RP3, RP4 and RP5. Significant correlations were identified between rSO2 and PaO2 (r = 0.448, P<0.001), rSO2 and PvO2 (r = 0.512, P<0.001) and rSO2 and SavO2 (r = 0.469, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS This is the first study to identify trends in rSO2 in horses using NIRS. A positive correlation was identified between rSO2 and PvO2, suggesting that alterations in cerebral oxygenation may be reflected in PvO2 . POTENTIAL RELEVANCE Near-infrared spectroscopy may be used to monitor trends in rSO2 during equine anaesthesia. Decreasing rSO2 values may act as an early warning signal, alerting clinicians to potential cerebral desaturation events and indicating a need for intervention.","McConnell, E J; Rioja, E; Bester, L; Sanz, M G; Fosgate, G T; Saulez, M N",Equine veterinary journal,https://doi.org/10.1111/evj.12001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23173738/,168

The moderator role of weight status].",2021-04-13,"Although povidone-iodine (PVP-I) has been used as a gargle since 1956, its effectiveness and material safety have been remained controversial. The aim of this study was to investigate the toxicity of PVP-I to epithelial cells in a concentration range significantly lower than that used clinically. Study design was in vitro laboratory investigations and in vivo histological and immunologic analysis. We examined the effects of PVP-I at concentrations of 1 × 10(-2) to 1 × 10(3) μM and 1 × 10(-4) to 1 × 10 μM on HeLa cells as a model of epithelial cells and rat oral mucosa, respectively, after 1 or 2 days of exposure. Annexin V/FLUOS was used to distinguish live, apoptotic and necrotic cells. The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) method was also used to observe whether apoptotic epithelial cells exist in rat oral mucosa after 1 day of exposure of PVP-I. HeLa cells developed concentration-dependent cytotoxicity, and epithelium of rat oral mucosa was thinned in a concentration-dependent manner. HeLa cell apoptosis increased after 1 × 10(0) μM of PVP-I exposure for 2 days. In the TUNEL method, many apoptotic epithelial cells were observed in the rat oral mucosa after 1 day of exposure to diluted 1 × 10(-2) μM of PVP-I, but minimal apoptotic epithelial cells were observed using 1 × 10(-3) μM of PVP-I. Our findings suggest that exposure to PVP-I, of which concentrations are even lower than those used clinically, causes toxicity in epithelial cells. This knowledge would help us better understand the risk of the use of PVP-I against mucosa.","Sato, So; Miyake, Masao; Hazama, Akihiro; Omori, Koichi",Drug and chemical toxicology,https://doi.org/10.3109/01480545.2013.846364; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24219135/,168

The contribution of host cell proteins to CoV transcription needs additional information. Polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) was reproducibly identified in association with positive-sense RNAs of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) TRS-L and TRS-B by affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry. A temporal regulation of PTB cytoplasmic levels was observed during infection, with a significant increase from 7 to 16 h postinfection being inversely associated with a decrease in viral replication and transcription. Silencing the expression of PTB with small interfering RNA in two cell lines (Huh7 and HEK 293T) led to a significant increase of up to 4-fold in mRNA levels and virus titer, indicating a negative effect of PTB on CoV RNA accumulation. During CoV infection, PTB relocalized from the nucleus to novel cytoplasmic structures different from replication-transcription sites in which stress granule markers T-cell intracellular antigen-1 (TIA-1) and TIA-1-related protein (TIAR) colocalized. PTB was detected in these modified stress granules in TGEV-infected swine testis cells but not in stress granules induced by oxidative stress. Furthermore, viral genomic and subgenomic RNAs were detected in association with PTB and TIAR. These cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein complexes might be involved in posttranscriptional regulation of virus gene expression.","Sola, Isabel; Galán, Carmen; Mateos-Gómez, Pedro A; Palacio, Lorena; Zúñiga, Sonia; Cruz, Jazmina L; Almazán, Fernando; Enjuanes, Luis",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00195-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21411518/,168

The human colon adeno-carcinoma cell line, CACO-2, has been previously used for the growth of multiple influenza viruses, including seasonal, novel and avian lineages. OBJECTIVE We compared CACO-2, Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK), and RhMK cells for the isolation of viruses from patients presenting with influenza like-illness (ILI). STUDY DESIGN Nasopharyngeal specimens from patients with ILI in primary care settings were processed for conventional viral culture in MDCK, RhMK, and CACO-2. Cells were examined microscopically for cytopathic effect (CPE) and confirmatory testing included immunofluorescent antigen (IFA) detection and real-time RT-PCR. Additionally, 16 specimens positive for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) by PCR were inoculated on CACO-2 cells. Statistical analysis was done using Chi-square test with IBM Statistical Program. RESULTS Of 1031 respiratory specimens inoculated, viruses were isolated and confirmed from 331 (32.1%) in MDCK cells, 304 (29.5%) in RhMk cells, and 433 (42.0%) in CACO-2 cells. These included influenza A/(H1N1)pdm09, influenza A(H3N2), influenza B, parainfluenza virus (PIV) types 1, 2, and 3, human coronavirus 229E (CoV-229E), human adenovirus (HAdV), herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV 1), and enterovirus (EV). Influenza A viruses grew best in the CACO-2 cell line. Time to observation of CPE was similar for all three cell types but unlike RhMK and MDCK cells, virus-specific morphological changes were indistinguishable in CACO-2 cells. None of the 16 specimens positive for RSV by PCR grew on CACO-2 cells. CONCLUSIONS The overall respiratory virus culture isolation rate in CACO-2 cells was significantly higher than that in RhMK or MDCK cells (p < 0.05). CACO-2 cells also supported the growth of some viruses that did not grow in either RhMK or MDCK cells. Except for RSV, CACO-2 cells provide a worthwhile addition to culture algorithms for respiratory specimens.","Ramani, Rama; Laplante, Jennifer M; Church, Theresa M; Farrell, Gregory M; Lamson, Daryl M; George, Kirsten St",Journal of virological methods,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2021.114120; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33676967/,168

Two surveys were administered on 3/26/2020 and 3/30/2020, respectively, to document immediate changes and challenges in clinical practice. METHOD Two surveys were administered between 3/26/2020 and 3/30/2020, via SurveyMonkey and Google Forms, asking clinicians questions pertaining to practice issues during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Quantitative responses from the second survey were stratified by clinical setting (Medical Hospital vs. Private Practice) prior to analysis. Qualitative, free-response items were coded by the authors to better understand immediate changes in practice and other concerns. RESULTS 266 neuropsychologists completed Survey 1 and 230 completed Survey 2. Results suggest that practices immediately moved towards remote service provision. A meaningful proportion of clinicians and their staff were immediately affected economically by the pandemic, with clinicians in private practice differentially affected. Furthermore, a small but significant minority of respondents faced ethical dilemmas related to service provision and expressed concerns with initial communication from their employment organizations. Respondents requested clear best-practice guidelines from neuropsychological practice organizations. CONCLUSIONS It is clear that field of neuropsychology has drastically shifted clinical practices in response to COVID-19 and is likely to continue to evolve. While these responses were collected in the early stages of stay-at-home orders, policy changes continue to occur and it is paramount that practice organizations consider the initial challenges expressed by clinicians when formulating practice recommendations and evaluating the clinical utility of telehealth services.","Marra, David E; Hoelzle, James B; Davis, Jeremy J; Schwartz, Eben S",The Clinical neuropsychologist,https://doi.org/10.1080/13854046.2020.1800098; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32723158/,168

CSCs are defined by their ability to divide both symmetrically and asymmetrically, to initiate new tumour growth and to tolerate the foreign niches required for metastatic dissemination. Accumulating evidence suggests that tumours arise from cells with stem-like properties, the generation of CSCs is therefore likely to be an initiatory event in carcinogenesis. Furthermore, CSCs in established tumours exist in a dynamic and plastic state, with non-stem tumour cells thought to be capable of de-differentiation to CSCs. The regulation of the CSC state both during tumour initiation and within established tumours is a desirable therapeutic target and is mediated by epigenetic factors. In this review we will explore the epigenetic parallels between induced pluripotency and the generation of CSCs, and discuss how the epigenetic regulation of CSCs opens up novel opportunities for therapeutic intervention.

We report our single-center experience of Y-stent assisted coiling of bifurcation aneurysms with the closed cell Enterprise stent in order to evaluate the safety and long-term results of this technique. The literature on Y-stenting and its hemodynamic effects are reviewed. METHODS Fifty-two consecutive patients with wide-neck bifurcation aneurysms underwent Y-stent assisted coiling with two Enterprise stents. The procedure was completed in 48 cases (92.3%) and technical failure occurred in 4 cases (7.3%). Cases performed with other stents were excluded. All procedures were performed under double antiplatelet therapy. Periodic clinical and neuroradiological follow-up was performed. RESULTS Mean neuroradiological follow-up time was 26 months. Complete immediate occlusion was obtained in 87.5% of patients. Two remnants had regrown at follow-up and were recoiled, achieving complete occlusion. The late neuroradiological occlusion rate was: complete occlusion 93.6%, neck remnant 4.3%, sac remnant 2.1%. No in-stent stenosis was detected at follow-up. Among the 48 procedures, two complications occurred (4.2%). Mortality was 2.1%. No delayed ischemic stroke occurred. CONCLUSIONS Y-stent assisted coiling has a high immediate occlusion rate and very good long-term stability. The procedure is relatively safe, although the complication and mortality rates are not negligible. Two Enterprise stents can be safely used for Y-stenting and, indeed, offer the advantage of easier catheterization, delivery and deployment into distal and tortuous vessels than open cell stents.","Limbucci, Nicola; Renieri, Leonardo; Nappini, Sergio; Consoli, Arturo; Rosi, Andrea; Mangiafico, Salvatore",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2014-011483; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25501447/,168
77755,Health Informatics Solutions in Response to COVID-19: Preliminary Insights from an International Survey.,2020-11-23,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is an important pathogen of swine worldwide and causes significant economic losses. Through regulating the host proteins phosphorylation, PRRSV was found to manipulate the activities of several signaling molecules to regulate innate immune responses. However, the role of protein phosphorylation during PRRSV infection and the signal pathways responsible for it are relatively unknown. Here liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for label-free quantitative phosphoproteomics was applied to systematically investigate the global phosphorylation events in PRRSV-infected pulmonary alveolar macrophages. In total, we identified 2125 unique phosphosites, of which the phosphorylation level of 292 phosphosites on 242 proteins and 373 phosphosites on 249 proteins was significantly altered at 12 and 36 h pi, respectively. The phosphoproteomics data were analyzed using ingenuity pathways analysis to identify defined canonical pathways and functional networks. Pathway analysis revealed that PRRSV-induced inflammatory cytokines production was probably due to the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and NF-κB signal pathway, which were regulated by several protein kinases during virus infection. Interacting network analysis indicated that altered phosphoproteins were involved in cellular assembly and organization, protein synthesis, molecular transport, and signal transduction in PRRSV infected cells. These pathways and functional networks analysis could provide direct insights into the biological significance of phosphorylation events modulated by PRRSV and may help us elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms of PRRSV infection.","Luo, Rui; Fang, Liurong; Jin, Hui; Wang, Dang; An, Kang; Xu, Ningzhi; Chen, Huanchun; Xiao, Shaobo",Journal of proteome research,https://doi.org/10.1021/pr400852d; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24533505/,168

Blocking adhesion molecules and thereby inhibiting migration of lymphocytes into sites of inflammation in the gut is an attractive new treatment target in drug development for IBD. Areas covered: This review discusses the preclinical and clinical experience on SHP647 (previously called PF-00547659 and PF-00547,659), a fully human IgG2K monoclonal antibody that binds to MAdCAM-1 to selectively reduce lymphocyte homing to the intestinal tract. Expert opinion: Blocking endothelial adhesion molecule MAdCAM-1 could represent an attractive target for the treatment of IBD. In the next years, the results from the phase III studies as well as data to support therapeutic drug monitoring based on drug levels to guide and optimize individual therapy will become available. Furthermore, much effort is put in the development of clinical prediction models to predict which drug is optimal for an individual patient.","Duijvestein, Marjolijn; D'Haens, Geert R",Expert opinion on biological therapy,https://doi.org/10.1080/14712598.2019.1576631; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30696342/,168

We identify some discoveries that may have clinical implications. METHODS The model requires 60-day-gestation fetal lambs. In lambs, glomerulogenesis is complete by 90 days gestation. (Term is 145 days.) The ability to develop a reliable method of creating bladder outlet obstruction in females, ligating both the urethra and urachus was critical. The lambs are bred to an accuracy of ±24 h. RESULTS Creating the model at 50-60 days gestation, produces different expressions of renal dysplasia in groups of lambs undergoing identical interventions at the same stage of gestation. Early complete urethral obstruction can produce the Potter phenotype. An appropriately timed vesico-amniotic shunt preserves renal development, producing a shrunken, non-compliant bladder. Shunting the normal fetal bladder at 80 days gestation produces a similar bladder. Provision of a low-pressure valve in the shunt preserves bladder development and compliance. Using a high-pressure shunt produces results similar to non-shunted lambs. DISCUSSION We developed a reliable animal model for obstructive uropathy. Being alert to peripheral results can lead to new findings.","Pringle, K C; Kitagawa, H; Seki, Y; Koike, J; Zuccollo, J",Pediatric surgery international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00383-013-3408-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24013366/,168

83709,Near Real-Time Telemetry of Nation-Wide ICU's Capacity Strain in Argentina.,2021-05-27,"BACKGROUND High-flow extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass is performed by using radial artery graphs (RAGs) or saphenous vein grafts (SVGs) for various pathologies such as aneurysms, ischemia, and skull-base tumors. Quantifying the acceptable amount of blood flow to maintain proper cerebral perfusion has not been well established, nor have the variables that influence flow been determined. OBJECTIVE To identify the normative range of blood flow through extracranial-intracranial RAGs and SVGs as measured by duplex ultrasonography. Multiple variables were evaluated to better understand their influence of graft flow. METHODS All EC-IC grafts performed at Harborview Medical Center from 2005 to 2012 were retrospectively reviewed for this cohort study. Daily extracranial graft duplex ultrasonography with flow volumes and transcranial graft Doppler were examined, as were short- and long-term outcomes. Both ischemic and hyperemic events were evaluated in further detail. RESULTS Eighty monitorable high-flow EC-IC bypasses were performed over the 8-year period. Sixty-five bypasses were performed by using RAGs and 15 were performed with SVGs. The average flow was 133 mL/min for RAGs and 160 mL/min for SVGs (P = .25). For both RAG and SVG groups, the donor and recipient vessel selected significantly impacted flow. For the RAG group only, preoperative graft diameter, postoperative hematocrit, and postoperative date significantly influenced flow. A 1-week average of >200 mL/min was 100% sensitive to cerebral hyperemia syndrome. CONCLUSION This study establishes the normative range of duplex ultrasonographic flow after high-flow EC-IC bypass, as well the usefulness and practicality of such monitoring as a surrogate to flow in the postoperative period.","Morton, Ryan P; Moore, Anne E; Barber, Jason; Tariq, Farzana; Hare, Kevin; Ghodke, Basavaraj; Kim, Louis J; Sekhar, Laligam N",Neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1227/neu.0000000000000198; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24089049/,168

85412,Abstract Journal Global Health Program.,2021-05-01,"Objective: To understand the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 cases in different epidemic stages in Gansu province. Methods: Epidemiological investigation was conducted to collect the information of confirmed COVID-19 cases, including demographic, epidemiological and clinical information. Results: As of 25 February 2020, a total of 91 confirmed COVID-19 cases had been reported in Gansu. The epidemic of COVID-19 in Gansu can be divided as three different stages, i.e. imported case stage, imported-case plus indigenous case stage, and indigenous case stage. A total of 63 cases were clustered cases (69.23%), 3 cases were medical staff infected with non-occupational exposure. The initial symptoms included fever (54.95%, 50/91), cough (52.75%, 48/91), or fatigue (28.57%, 26/91), the proportion of each symptom showed a decreasing trend along with the three epidemic stages, but only the differences in proportions of fever (trend χ2=2.20, P<0.05) and fatigue (trend χ2=3.18, P<0.05) among the three epidemic stages were statistically significant. The cases with critical severe symptoms accounted for 42.85% (6/14), 23.73% (14/59) and 16.67% (3/18), respectively, in three epidemic stages, showed a decreasing trend (H=6.45, P<0.05). Also, the incubation period prolonged along with the epidemic stage (F=51.65, P<0.01), but the intervals between disease onset and hospital visit (F=5.32, P<0.01), disease onset and diagnosis (F=5.25, P<0.01) became shorter along with the epidemic stage. Additionally, the basic reproduction number (R0) had decreased from 2.61 in imported case stage to 0.66 in indigenous case stage. Conclusions: The COVID-19 epidemic in Gansu was caused by the imported cases, and about 2/3 cases were clustered ones. No medical worker was observed to be infected by occupational exposure. With the progression of COVID-19 epidemic in Gansu, the change in initial symptom and incubation period suggests, the early screening cannot only depend on body temperature monitoring.","Gou, F X; Zhang, X S; Yao, J X; Yu, D S; Wei, K F; Zhang, H; Yang, X T; Yang, J J; Liu, H X; Cheng, Y; Jiang, X J; Zheng, Y H; Wu, B; Liu, X F; Li, H",Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112338-20200229-00216; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32234127/,168

88433,Performance benefits of rehydration with intravenous fluid and oral glycerol.,2012,"A critical step in replication of positive-stranded RNA viruses is the assembly of replication and transcription complexes (RTC). We have recently mapped the nonstructural protein (nsp) interaction network of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and provided evidence by truncation mutagenesis that the recruitment of viral core replicase enzymes (nsp9 and nsp10) to membrane proteins (nsp2, nsp3, nsp5 and nsp12) is subject to regulation. Here, we went further to discover an intramolecular switch within the helicase nsp10 that controls its interaction with the membrane-associated protein nsp12. Deletion of nsp10 linker region aa.124-133 connecting the domain 1B to 1A led to complete re-localization and co-localization in the cells co-expressing nsp12. Moreover, single amino acid substitutions (e.g., nsp10 E131A and I132A) were sufficient to enable the nsp10-nsp12 interaction. Further proof came from membrane floatation assays that revealed a clear movement of nsp10 mutants, but not WT nsp10, towards the top of sucrose gradients in the presence of nsp12. Interestingly, the same mutations were not able to activate the nsp10-nsp2/3 interaction, suggesting a differential requirement for conformation. Reverse genetics analysis showed that PRRSV mutants carrying the single substitutions were not viable and defective of subgenomic RNA (sg RNA) accumulation. Together, our results provide strong evidence for a regulated interaction between nsp10 and nsp12 and suggest an essential role for an orchestrated RTC assembly in sg RNA synthesis. IMPORTANCE Assembly of replication and transcription complexes (RTC) is a limiting step for viral RNA synthesis. The PRRSV RTC macromolecular complexes are comprised of mainly viral nonstructural replicase proteins (nsps), but how they come together remains elusive. We previously showed that viral helicase nsp10 interacts nsp12 in a regulated manner by truncation mutagenesis. Here we revealed that the interaction is controlled by single residues within the domain linker region of nsp10. Moreover, the activation mutations leads to defect in viral sg RNA synthesis. Our results provide important insight into the mechanisms of PRRSV RTC assembly and regulation of viral sg RNA synthesis.","Hu, Yunhao; Ke, Purui; Gao, Peng; Zhang, Yongning; Zhou, Lei; Ge, Xinna; Guo, Xin; Han, Jun; Yang, Hanchun",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00518-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34076477/,168

This is mainly because of the problem of sterilizing natural orifices, which prevents the use of any prosthetic material because of unacceptable risks of infection. Single-incision laparoscopic ventral hernia repair has gained more wide-spread acceptance by specialized hernia centers. Even so, there is a special subset of patients who are young and/or scar conscious and find any visible scar unacceptable. This study illustrates an innovative way of performing single-incision laparoscopic ventral hernia repair by a transverse suprapubic incision below the pubic hair/bikini line in 2 young male patients who had both umbilical and epigastric hernias as well as attenuated linea alba in the upper abdomen. CASE DESCRIPTION Both patients underwent successful laparoscopic repair, and both were highly satisfied with the procedure, which produced no visible scars on their abdomen. DISCUSSION Willingness to adopt new innovative procedures, such as single-incision laparoscopic surgery, has allowed modification of the incision site to produce invisible scars and hence become highly attractive to the young and scar-phobic segment of the population.","Tran, Hanh; Turingan, Isidro; Tran, Mai",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.4293/108680813x13654754534431; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23925028/,168

The prevalence of this infection in South African feedlots is unknown. Ear notch biopsies were collected from chronic poor doers and animals that appeared unthrifty upon entering feedlots, as well as animals entering the hospital pen with respiratory disease for the first time. A total of 1690 samples were collected: 1074 from the former category and 616 from the latter. A routine immunohistochemistry staining protocol showed that 49 animals tested positive, of which 43 (4%) came from the feedlot entry group and six (1%) from the hospitalised group. The prevalence of persistently infected cattle from this selected, nonrandom sample entering six large South African feedlots was found to be 2.9%, which is higher than the international rule of thumb that 0.5% of all cattle entering feedlots are persistently infected. There was no clear correlation between persistent infection and respiratory disease. Serum samples were also collected when possible and 10 positive cases were found. Results from enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for antigen and antibody performed on these sera correlated well with those from the immunohistochemistry staining method in six cases, but in four cases the animals tested falsely positive owing to nonspecific staining. Immunohistochemistry staining on ear notch biopsies is thus a reliable diagnostic method to identify persistently infected animals with BVDV, but the pathologist should be aware of nonspecific positive staining.","Meiring, Thelma; Prozesky, Leon; Du Preez, Eben R; Verwoerd, Dirk J",The Onderstepoort journal of veterinary research,https://doi.org/10.4102/ojvr.v78i1.323; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23327211/,168
89879,Mapping the Qualitative Evidence Base on the Use of Research Evidence in Health Policy-Making: A Systematic Review.,2020-11-01,"BACKGROUND The cellular immune system is of pivotal importance with regard to the response to severe infections. Monocytes/macrophages are considered key immune cells in infections and downregulation of the surface expression of monocytic human leukocyte antigen-DR (mHLA-DR) within the major histocompatibility complex class II reflects a state of immunosuppression, also referred to as injury-associated immunosuppression. As the role of immunosuppression in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently unclear, we seek to explore the level of mHLA-DR expression in COVID-19 patients. METHODS In a preliminary prospective monocentric observational study, 16 COVID-19-positive patients (75% male, median age: 68 [interquartile range 59-75]) requiring hospitalization were included. The median Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation-II (APACHE-II) score in 9 intensive care unit (ICU) patients with acute respiratory failure was 30 (interquartile range 25-32). Standardized quantitative assessment of HLA-DR on monocytes (cluster of differentiation 14+ cells) was performed using calibrated flow cytometry at baseline (ICU/hospital admission) and at days 3 and 5 after ICU admission. Baseline data were compared to hospitalized noncritically ill COVID-19 patients. RESULTS While normal mHLA-DR expression was observed in all hospitalized noncritically ill patients (n = 7), 89% (8 of 9) critically ill patients with COVID-19-induced acute respiratory failure showed signs of downregulation of mHLA-DR at ICU admission. mHLA-DR expression at admission was significantly lower in critically ill patients (median, [quartiles]: 9280 antibodies/cell [6114, 16,567]) as compared to the noncritically ill patients (30,900 antibodies/cell [26,777, 52,251]), with a median difference of 21,508 antibodies/cell (95% confidence interval [CI], 14,118-42,971), P = .002. Reduced mHLA-DR expression was observed to persist until day 5 after ICU admission. CONCLUSIONS When compared to noncritically ill hospitalized COVID-19 patients, ICU patients with severe COVID-19 disease showed reduced mHLA-DR expression on circulating CD14+ monocytes at ICU admission, indicating a dysfunctional immune response. This immunosuppressive (monocytic) phenotype remained unchanged over the ensuing days after ICU admission. Strategies aiming for immunomodulation in this population of critically ill patients should be guided by an immune-monitoring program in an effort to determine who might benefit best from a given immunological intervention.","Spinetti, Thibaud; Hirzel, Cedric; Fux, Michaela; Walti, Laura N; Schober, Patrick; Stueber, Frank; Luedi, Markus M; Schefold, Joerg C",Anesthesia and analgesia,https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0000000000005044; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32925314/,168

This study was designed to evaluate the results of laparoscopic colorectal resections in normal weight patients compared with overweight and obese patients with IBD. METHODS A retrospective analysis of a prospectively acquired institutional review board-approved surgical database was performed. All consecutive patients with IBD who underwent laparoscopy from January 1, 2000 to April 30, 2008 were reviewed. BMI, age, gender, comorbidities, ASA classification, and surgical- and disease-related variables, including 60-day postoperative complications, were reviewed. Chi-square, Mann-Whitney U test, and Student's t test were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS A total of 261 patients with IBD underwent laparoscopy: 48 were excluded and 213 were analyzed. Group I comprised 127 normal-weight patients (body mass index (BMI), 18.5-24.9 kg/m(2)), and group II included 67 overweight patients (BMI, 25-29.9 kg/m(2)) and 19 obese patients (BMI >or= 30 kg/m(2)). Crohn's disease was diagnosed in 86 (67.7%) patients in group I and 52 (60.4%) in group II. Procedures performed included ileocolic resection in 56% of patients in each group. Total colectomy with or without proctectomy was undertaken in 39.4% in group I and 40.7% in group II. The conversion rate was 18% for group I and 22.09% for group II (p > 0.005; not significant). The most common reason for conversion was failure to progress due to adhesions or phlegmon. There were no differences in major postoperative complication rates (wound infection, abscess, anastomotic leakage, or small-bowel obstruction) or mean hospital stay (6.7, 6.8, respectively), and there was no mortality. CONCLUSIONS Patients with IBD who were overweight or obese and who underwent laparoscopic bowel resection had no significant differences in the rates of conversion, major postoperative complications, or length of stay when comparing to patients with normal BMI. Therefore, the benefits of laparoscopic bowel resection should not be denied to overweight or obese patients based strictly on their BMI.","Canedo, Jorge; Pinto, Rodrigo A; Regadas, Sthela; Regadas, F Sergio P; Rosen, Lester; Wexner, Steven D",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-009-0759-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20044772/,168

This study determined the longitudinal degree of hospital variation in proportion of patients with gallstone disease undergoing cholecystectomy, while adjusted for case-mix, and the effect on clinical outcomes. METHODS A nationwide, longitudinal, database study was performed in all hospitals in the Netherlands in 2013-2015. Patients with gallstone disease were collected from the diagnosis-related group database. Hospital variation in case-mix-adjusted cholecystectomy rates was calculated per year. Clinical outcomes after cholecystectomy were compared between hospitals in the lowest/highest 20th percentile of the distribution of adjusted cholecystectomy rates in all 3 subsequent years. RESULTS In total, 96,673 patients with gallstones were included. The cholecystectomy rate was 73.6%. In 2013-2015, the case-mix-adjusted performance of cholecystectomies was in hospitals with high rates 1.5-1.6 times higher than in hospitals with low rates. Hospitals with a high adjusted cholecystectomy rate had a higher laparoscopy rate, shorter time to surgery, and less emergency department visits after a cholecystectomy compared to hospitals with a low-adjusted cholecystectomy rate. CONCLUSION Hospital variation in cholecystectomies in the Netherlands is modest, cholecystectomy rates varies by <2-fold, and variation is stable over time. Cholecystectomies in hospitals with high adjusted cholecystectomy rates are associated with improved outcomes.","Latenstein, Carmen S S; Wennmacker, Sarah Z; Groenewoud, Stef; Noordenbos, Mark W; Atsma, Femke; de Reuver, Philip R",Digestive surgery,https://doi.org/10.1159/000510503; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937632/,168

96580,Public Health in North Carolina.,2021,"INTRODUCTION Axillary sentinel node biopsy for melanoma is routinely performed under general anaesthesia. Emerging evidence has shown general anaesthetics are associated with increased mortality in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the interest of patient safety, we have designed a series of bespoke axillary regional blocks enabling surgeons to remove nodes up to and including level III without the need for a general anaesthetic. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of performing axillary sentinel node biopsy under such blocks. METHODS Approval was granted by the Joint Study Review Committee on behalf of the Research and Ethics Department. Ten consecutive patients having axillary sentinel node biopsy for melanoma were included in this prospective study. Patients completed a Quality of Recovery-15 (QoR15) questionnaire preoperatively and 24 h postoperatively. DISCUSSION One patient had a positive sentinel node, the remining were negative. A significant reduction in time spent in hospital post-operatively (p = 0.0008) was observed. QoR15 patient reported outcome measures demonstrated high levels of satisfaction evidenced by lack of statistical difference between pre and post-operative scores (p = 0.0118). 80% of patients were happy to have a regional block and 90% were happy to attend hospital during the pandemic. CONCLUSION ASNB under regional block is safe, negates risks associated with performing GAs during the COVID-19 pandemic and facilitates quicker theatre turnover and discharge from hospital. Collaboration between anaesthetic and surgical teams has enabled this change in practice. There is a learning curve with both patient selection, education and development of technique.","Clancy, R; Hemington-Gorse, S; Pope-Jones, S; Jayakumar, A; Beynon, C; Egeler, C; Cubitt, J","Journal of plastic, reconstructive & aesthetic surgery : JPRAS",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bjps.2021.05.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34229958/,168
97534,Global health diplomacy.,2008,"Objectives The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to date, the epidemic has gradually spread to 209 countries worldwide with more than 1.5 million infected people and 100,000 deaths. Amplification of viral RNA by rRT-PCR serves as the gold standard for confirmation of infection, yet it needs a long turnaround time (3-4 h to generate results) and shows false-negative rates as large as 15%-20%. In addition, the need of certified laboratories, expensive equipment and trained personnel led many countries to limit the rRT-PCR tests only to individuals with pronounced respiratory syndrome symptoms. Thus, there is a need for alternative, less expensive and more accessible tests. Methods We analyzed the plasma levels of white blood cells (WBCs), platelets, C-reactive protein (CRP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of 207 patients who, after being admitted to the emergency room of the San Raffaele Hospital (Milan, Italy) with COVID-19 symptoms, were rRT-PCR tested. Of them, 105 tested positive, whereas 102 tested negative. Results Statistically significant differences were observed for WBC, CRP, AST, ALT and LDH. Empirical thresholds for AST and LDH allowed the identification of 70% of either COVID-19-positive or -negative patients on the basis of routine blood test results. Conclusions Combining appropriate cutoffs for certain hematological parameters could help in identifying false-positive/negative rRT-PCR tests. Blood test analysis might be used as an alternative to rRT-PCR for identifying COVID-19-positive patients in those countries which suffer from a large shortage of rRT-PCR reagents and/or specialized laboratory.","Ferrari, Davide; Motta, Andrea; Strollo, Marta; Banfi, Giuseppe; Locatelli, Massimo",Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.1515/cclm-2020-0398; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32301746/,168

Two broad categories of ONFH exist: traumatic and non-traumatic. Traumatic ONFH results from acute mechanical disruption of the femoral head's blood supply. Many factors that increase the risk of non-traumatic osteonecrosis have been identified. Steroid-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head (SONFH) is the most common form of non-traumatic ONFH. Many hypotheses as to the pathogenesis of SONFH have been proposed, including intravascular thrombosis, abnormal fat metabolism, intramedullary adipocyte hypertrophy, and osteoporosis; however, the exact mechanism of SONFH is still not clearly understood. Animal models using rats, mice, rabbits, chickens, pigs, and emus have been used to study SONFH. Unfortunately, these models each have limitations. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a reproducible model that better simulates human disease. The present review is intended to summarize the currently available models, evaluative indicators, and application of current understanding to both the prevention and treatment of SONFH.","Xu, Jianzhong; Gong, Hanpu; Lu, Shitao; Deasey, Matthey J; Cui, Quanjun",International orthopaedics,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00264-018-3956-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29705870/,168

OBJECTIVES This study was designed to compare the effectiveness of a Yankauer vs. an ETT-meconium aspirator set-up in suctioning liquids of different viscosities. METHODS The Yankauer and ETT-meconium aspirator device underwent a head-to-head timed comparison, suctioning 250 mL of three different fluids, varying in viscosity. The first comparison test used tap water to represent simple oral secretions. The second comparison test used porcine whole blood as a proxy for human blood. The third comparison test used a coarsely blended mixture of a hamburger, French fries, and a soda to simulate emesis from a recently ingested meal. Five separate time trials were conducted for each liquid and for each suction device. RESULTS The ETT-meconium aspirator device compared to the Yankauer suctioned faster in both the water comparison test (mean = 2.6 s vs. 3.4 s; p < 0.001) and the porcine whole blood comparison test (mean = 2.9 s vs. 4.3 s; p = 0.0015). In the emesis trial, the Yankauer immediately clogged, whereas the ETT-meconium aspirator apparatus managed to suction an average of 90 mL prior to clogging. CONCLUSION Compared to the Yankauer, an adult 8.0 ETT connected to a meconium aspirator was superior in suctioning liquids of varying viscosities and should be considered when encountering a difficult airway due to copious secretions, blood, or emesis.","Kei, Jonathan; Mebust, Donald P",The Journal of emergency medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jemermed.2016.09.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27751699/,168
100312,The Relationship between Anxiety Levels and Perceived Social Support during the Pandemic of COVID-19 in Turkey.,2020-09-01,"The EU Landfill Directive requires Member States to reduce the amount of biodegradable waste disposed of to landfill. This has been a key driver for the establishment of new waste management options, particularly in the UK, which in the past relied heavily on landfill for the disposal of municipal solid waste (MSW). MSW in the UK is managed by Local Authorities, some of which in a less conventional way have been encouraging the installation and use of household food waste disposal units (FWDs) as an option to divert food waste from landfill. This study aimed to evaluate the additional burden to water industry operations in the UK associated with this option, compared with the benefits and related savings from the subsequent reductions in MSW collection and disposal. A simple economic analysis was undertaken for different FWD uptake scenarios, using the Anglian Region as a case study. Results demonstrated that the significant savings from waste collection arising from a large-scale uptake of FWDs would outweigh the costs associated with the impacts to the water industry. However, in the case of a low uptake, such savings would not be enough to cover the increased costs associated with the wastewater provision. As a result, this study highlights the need for policy intervention in terms of regulating the use of FWDs, either promoting them as an alternative to landfill to increase savings from waste management, or banning them as a threat to wastewater operations to reduce potential costs to the water industry.","Iacovidou, Eleni; Ohandja, Dieudonne-Guy; Voulvoulis, Nikolaos",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2012.01.048; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22397903/,168

Cities in different countries prefer to transform their infrastructure based on sustainability guidelines and practices. Meanwhile, smart technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain are being recently used in different urban systems of cities that aim to transform into smart cities. MWM systems are one of the main targets of integrating such smart technologies to maximize economic and social profits and minimize environmental issues. However, the transformation of traditional MWM systems into smart MWM systems and the adoption of such technologies can be a very resource-consuming task. One of the possible tasks in this process can be the identification of factors that cause failure in the adoption of smart technologies. Therefore, this study proposes a multi-criteria evaluation model based on type-2 neutrosophic numbers (T2NNs) to identify factors contributing to failure in the adoption of IoT and blockchain in smart MWM systems in Istanbul, Turkey. Results of the case study indicate that training for different stakeholders, market acceptance, transparency, and professional personnel are the main factors that lead to failure in the adoption of smart technologies. Training for different stakeholders, market acceptance, transparency, and professional personnel factors obtained distance values of 0.494, 0.381, 0.375, and 0.278, respectively, against the best factor which is security and privacy. In order to validate the results of the proposed approach, a sensitivity analysis test is performed.

An anonymous online questionnaire with twenty-one questions was distributed in February 2019 via the British and Irish Orthoptic Society (BIOS) members' newsletter. Objectives were to investigate: methods used, frequency of assessment, limiting factors and opinions of importance. Informed consent was gained to include the responses in the study. The data was analyzed using descriptive statistics and Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Testing. The questionnaire was completed by 105 orthoptists. The methods reported to quantify ductions and fields of BSV respectively were: Goldmann (33% and 34%), Aimark (22 and 23%), Lister (7%), Octopus (5 and 4%), Thomson ocular motility analyzer (2 and 3%), Binocular vision analyzer (2%) and no method reported (30% and 32%). The frequency of measuring ductions and fields of BSV per week (median 1-2) was significantly less than the number of patients seen with limited ocular motility per week (median 6-9). The main reasons for never or rarely measuring ductions or fields of BSV were not enough time, no method available and only on selected patients. Respondents indicated that they would measure ductions and fields of BSV more frequently if a quicker portable method was available (median 3-5 times per week). Most agreed that measurements of ductions and fields of BSV are important (89 and 95% respectively). There is no standardized method of quantitively measuring ductions or fields of BSV, with almost a third of respondents not measuring either. Although most orthoptists agreed these measurements are important, they are infrequently performed. The main factors limiting these assessments are insufficient time and lack of a testing method. If a faster portable device was available, orthoptists would measure ductions and fields of BSV more frequently.","Jukes, Catherine; Bjerre, A; Codina, C; Griffiths, H",Strabismus,https://doi.org/10.1080/09273972.2021.1914679; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33904348/,168

We developed a new, easy, and inexpensive dermatotraction technique based on the simple use of Ty-Raps and report on the first pilot study using this novel technique for the closure of 23 extremity fasciotomy wounds. The Ty-Rap system consists of several combinations of two Ty-Raps and four surgical staples. Immediately after fasciotomy, the system is secured to the skin by the surgical staples, and once the swelling of the affected limb is subsided, the Ty-Raps are tightened every 24 hours to 48 hours until full approximation of the skin edges is achieved. We recorded the time to closure of the wound, the time to removal of the Ty-Raps, and the complications related to the procedure. Also, a cost analyses was calculated. The mean time of approximation of the skin was 6.3 days, and after a further 9.4 days, the Ty-Raps could be removed. The majority of the wounds (91%) healed without complications, and only one patient in our series required a secondary surgical procedure for the closure of one fasciotomy wound. The total cost to close a fasciotomy wound of 30 cm with the use of Ty-Raps is US dollar 23.33. We regard the use of Ty-Raps a good alternative for the current closing techniques of extremity fasciotomy wounds. We value its low cost, general availability, effectiveness, and the fact that, in this pilot study, both the application and the tightening of the Ty-Raps were well tolerated by our patients with a minimal need for secondary procedures. Knowledge of this technique is a useful adjunct to the existing surgical array for every trauma and orthopedic surgeon for the closure of extremity fasciotomy wounds, especially in austere or military environments.","Govaert, Geertruida A M; van Helden, Svenhjalmar",The Journal of trauma,https://doi.org/10.1097/ta.0b013e3181f2d9d3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20938282/,168

We will focus on are skin disorders such as autoimmune connective tissue disorders, neutrophilic dermatoses and vasculitis. Immunomodulators such as colchicine and antimalarials can easily be preferred taking their beneficial effects on Covid-19 into consideration and also given their wide spectrum of action. Among the conventional therapies, methotrexate, azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil increase the risk of infection, and thus their use is recommended only when necessary and at low doses. On the other hand, use of cyclosporine is also not recommended as it increases the risk of hypertension, which is susceptible to Covid-19. Anti-TNF agents from among the biological therapies appear to be slightly risky in terms of susceptibility to infection. However, there are ongoing studies which suggest that some biological treatments may reduce cytokine storm impeding the Covid-19 progression as a result, in spite of their susceptibilities to Covid-19. Patients, who will be started on immunosuppressive therapy, should be tested for Covid-19 prior to the therapy, and in the event that Covid-19 is suspected, the therapy should be discontinued.

Tremendous effort has been spent to investigate the effective way to prevent this ""complication"" including the modification of surgical technique, use of per-peritoneal drainage, etc. There were debates about the use of monopolar diathermy versus blunt dissection in laparoscopic TEP in the prevention of seroma formation. This randomized study aims to compare the effects of using 2 techniques in laparoscopic TEP on pre-peritoneal drain output and seroma formation. METHOD From 1.9.2018 to 30.9.2019, all male and female patients presented with the first occurrence, unilateral inguinal hernia anticipated for laparoscopic TEP were enrolled into the study after informed consent. Patients were randomized into ""monopolar dissection preferred"" (MDP) group and ""blunt dissection-preferred"" (BDP) group just before commencing of operation after general anesthesia. Surgeons were instructed to use monopolar energy as main dissection method for the whole operation if possible (MDP), whereas blunt dissection is the preferred choice in BDP group, but the use of monopolar energy was allowed if needed. Total energy time was measured by a specially designed homemade device attaching to the monopolar pedals as accurate as to millisecond (ms). Pre-peritoneal drains were inserted for drainage and removed 23 h after operation. Drainage output, total operating time, energy time, clinical and ultrasonic seroma sizes at day 1, day 6, 1-month post operations, recurrence are compared between 2 groups. RESULTS A total of 103 patients where included. There was no significant difference in age, gender, co-morbidities, side of hernia, mean defect size, operating time, fixation adjuncts, or postoperative stay. The drain volume in BDP group is 71.13 ± 31.42 mL while it in MDP group is 56.36 ± 21.46 mL. The MDP group had significantly fewer drain output at 23 h post operation (p = 0.007) and lower seroma incidence on days 6 (p = 0.036). Overall incidence of seroma formation was 12% on postoperative day 1, 11% on postoperative day 7. No statistically differences in postoperative pain score or complications were observed at the first week, 1- and 3-months' post operation. There was no correlation with energy time to the drain output. No recurrence was found in subsequent follow-up. CONCLUSION Pre-peritoneal drainage is clinically safe in laparoscopic totally extra-peritoneal hernioplasty and can effectively reduce the size and incidence of seroma. The seroma formation can be further reduced by appropriate use of monopolar energy as preferred dissection approach in lap TEP. Due to limitation in measuring the actual energy time, the result should be further validated by randomized multi-centers trial on its potential benefit in hernia repair by a more accurate measuring device on energy used.","Liu, J W; Chen, K J; Xu, X H; Deng, Y; Zhang, H; Chan, F S Y; Kim, H J; Fan, J K M",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-020-02136-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32072340/,168

VEEV was weaponized during the Cold War and is recognized as a select agent. Currently, there are no FDA-approved vaccines or therapeutics for these viruses. The spread of VEEV and other members of this family due to climate change-mediated vector range expansion underscores the need for research aimed at developing medical countermeasures. These viruses utilize programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF) to synthesize the viral trans-frame (TF) protein, which has previously been shown to be important for neuropathogenesis in the related Sindbis virus. Here, the alphavirus -1 PRF signals were characterized, revealing novel -1 PRF stimulatory structures. -1 PRF attenuation mildly affected the kinetics of VEEV accumulation in cultured cells but strongly inhibited its pathogenesis in an aerosol infection mouse model. Importantly, the decreased viral titers in the brains of mice infected with the mutant virus suggest that the alphavirus TF protein is important for passage through the blood-brain barrier and/or for neuroinvasiveness. These findings suggest a novel approach to the development of safe and effective live attenuated vaccines directed against VEEV and perhaps other closely related -1 PRF-utilizing viruses. IMPORTANCE Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) is a select agent that has been weaponized.

112529,Facilitating Study and Item Level Browsing for Clinical and Epidemiological COVID-19 Studies.,2021-05-27,"BACKGROUND Patients with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) experience frequent readmissions; however, studies focused on patients' and caregivers' perceptions of their transitional care experiences to identify root causes of burdensome transitions of care are lacking. AIM To explore the transitional care experiences of patients with ESLD and their caregivers in order to identify their supportive care needs. METHODS We conducted interviews with 15 patients with ESLD and 14 informal caregivers. We used semi-structured interview guides to explore their experiences since the diagnosis of ESLD including their care transitions. Two raters coded interviews independently (κ = 0.95) using template analysis. RESULTS Participants reported feeling unprepared to manage their informational, psychosocial, and practical care needs as they transitioned from hospital to home after the diagnosis of ESLD. Delay in the timely receipt of supportive care services addressing these care needs resulted in hospital readmissions, emotional distress, caregiver burnout, reduced work capacity, and financial hardship. Participants shared the following resources that they perceived would improve their quality of care: (1) discharge checklist, (2) online resources, (3) mental health support, (4) caregiver support and training, and (5) financial navigation. CONCLUSION Transitional care models that attend to the informational, psychosocial, and practical domains of care are needed to better support patients with ESLD and their caregivers at the time of diagnosis and beyond. Without attending to the multidimensional care needs of newly diagnosed patients with ESLD and their caregivers, they are at risk of burdensome transitions of care, high healthcare utilization, and poor health-related quality of life.","Ufere, Nneka N; Donlan, John; Indriolo, Teresa; Richter, James; Thompson, Ryan; Jackson, Vicki; Volandes, Angelo; Chung, Raymond T; Traeger, Lara; El-Jawahri, Areej",Digestive diseases and sciences,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10620-020-06617-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32964286/,168
113192,Epidemiological Analysis of the Covid-19 Epidemic in Greece.,2020-06-26,"OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this article is to evaluate whether digital mammography (DM) is associated with persistent increased detection of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or has altered the upgrade rate of DCIS to invasive cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS. An institutional review board-approved retrospective search identified DCIS diagnosed in women with mammographic calcifications between 2001 and 2014. Ipsilateral cancer within 2 years, masses, papillary DCIS, and patients with outside imaging were excluded, yielding 484 cases. Medical records were reviewed for mammographic calcifications, technique, and pathologic diagnosis. Mammograms were interpreted by radiologists certified by the Mammography Quality Standards Act. The institution transitioned from film-screen mammography (FSM) to exclusive DM by 2010. Statistical analyses were performed using chi-square test. RESULTS. Of 484 DCIS cases, 158 (33%) were detected by FSM and 326 (67%) were detected by DM. The detection rate was higher with DM than FSM (1.4 and 0.7 per 1000, respectively; p < .001). The detection rate of high-grade DCIS doubled with DM compared with FSM (0.8 and 0.4 per 1000, respectively; p < .001). The prevalent peak of DM-detected DCIS was 2.7 per 1000 in 2008. Incident DM detection remained double FSM (1.4 vs 0.7 per 1000). Similar proportions of high-grade versus low- to intermediate-grade DCIS were detected with both modalities. There was no significant difference in the upgrade rate of DCIS to invasive cancer between DM (10%; 34/326) and FSM (10%; 15/158) (p = .74). High-grade DCIS led to 71% (35/49) of the upgrades to invasive cancer. CONCLUSION. DM was associated with a significant doubling in DCIS and high-grade DCIS detection, which persisted after prevalent peak. The majority of upgrades to invasive cancer arose from high-grade DCIS. DM was not associated with decreased upgrade to invasive cancer.","Neal, Colleen H; Joe, Annette I; Patterson, Stephanie K; Pujara, Akshat C; Helvie, Mark A",AJR.

METHOD Adjusted relative risks/hazard ratios were calculated for the associations between BMI category (underweight, normal-weight, overweight, class 1 obesity, class 2 obesity, and class 3 obesity) and testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 or experiencing hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, and death among those testing positive. RESULTS Higher BMI categories were associated with higher risk of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test compared to the normal-weight category (class 3 obesity adjusted relative risk 1.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.28-1.42). Among 25,952 SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, class 3 obesity was associated with higher risk of mechanical ventilation (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.77, 95%CI 1.35-2.32) and mortality (aHR 1.42, 95%CI 1.12-1.78) compared to normal-weight individuals. These associations were present primarily in patients <65 and were attenuated or absent in older age groups (interaction p<0.05). CONCLUSION VA enrollees with higher BMI were more likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were more likely to be mechanically ventilated or die if SARS-CoV-2-infected. Higher BMIs contributed relatively more to the risk of death in those <65 years of age as compared to other age categories.","Eastment, McKenna C; Berry, Kristin; Locke, Emily; Green, Pamela; O'Hare, Ann; Crothers, Kristina; Dominitz, Jason; Fan, Vincent S; Shah, Javeed A; Ioannou, George N",Obesity,https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.23111; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33336934/,168
116619,"Massage impairs postexercise muscle blood flow and ""lactic acid"" removal.",2010,"INTRODUCTION Early identification and appropriate treatment of child and adolescent mental health disorders can often be hampered by patchwork services with poorly planned or unclear pathways. The Choice and Partnership Approach (CAPA) is an evidence-based transformational model of community (community-based or outpatient) mental health and addictions services for children and adolescents that aims to better match services to needs and to improve timely access to care. CAPA has been variably implemented across jurisdictions but has not been comprehensively evaluated for its impact on system and client outcomes. Our research question is, 'To what degree does CAPA work, for whom and under what circumstances?'. The purpose of this review is twofold: (1) to gain an understanding of the extent and outcomes of the implementation of CAPA in community mental health and addictions services; and (2) to identify the role of context as it influences the implementation of CAPA and resulting client and system outcomes. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will conduct a realist-informed scoping review of the literature related to CAPA in either child and adolescent or adult community mental health and addictions services. Relevant studies, reports and documentation will be identified by searching the following online databases: MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Academic Search Premier, ERIC, Web of Science, Cochrane, Dissertations Abstracts, NCBI Bookshelf, PubMed Central and the Canadian Health Research Collection. The search strategy was developed by a health sciences library scientist and informed by a multidisciplinary team comprising methodological and content knowledge experts. The search will gather evidence from multiple online databases of peer-reviewed literature and grey literature repositories. All articles will be independently assessed for inclusion by pairs of reviewers. The key themes derived from a thematic analysis of extracted data will be presented in a narrative overview. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Research ethics review is not required for this scoping review. The results will be disseminated through meetings with stakeholders (including clients and families, clinicians and decision-makers), conference presentations and peer-reviewed publication. The results of this review will inform an overarching programme of research, policy and quality indicator development to ultimately improve mental health and addictions care and subsequent mental health outcomes for children and adolescents.","Campbell, Leslie Anne; Clark, Sharon E; Ayn, Caitlyn; Chorney, Jill; Emberly, Debbie; MacDonald, Julie; MacKenzie, Adrian; Marsh, Daniel; Peacock, Kylie; Wozney, Lori",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2019-033247; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31874887/,168
116784,Cold Water Ingestion Improves Exercise Tolerance of Heat-Sensitive People with MS.,2018,"BACKGROUND Large radial tears of the meniscus involving the avascular region can compromise meniscal function and result in poor healing and subsequent osteochondral degeneration. Augmentation of surgical repairs with adipose-derived stromal vascular fraction (SVF), which contains mesenchymal stromal cells, may improve meniscal healing and preserve function (ie, chondroprotection). PURPOSES (1) To develop a goat model of a radial meniscal tear with resulting osteoarthritis and (2) to explore the efficacy of a 1-step procedure utilizing infrapatellar fat pad-derived SVF cells seeded in a photocrosslinkable hydrogel to enhance meniscal healing and mitigate osteochondral degeneration. STUDY DESIGN Controlled laboratory study. METHODS A full-thickness radial tear spanning 90% of the medial meniscal width was made at the junction of the anterior and middle bodies of the goat stifle joint. Tears received 1 of 3 interventions (n = 4 per group): untreated, repair, or repair augmented with photocrosslinkable methacrylated gelatin hydrogel containing 2.0 × 106 SVF cells/mL and 2.0 µg/mL of transforming growth factor β3. The contralateral (left) joint served as a healthy control. At 6 months, meniscal healing and joint health were evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and assessed by histological and macroscopic scoring. The Whole-Organ Magnetic Resonance Imaging Score and the presence of a residual tear, as evaluated with T2 MRI sequences, were determined by a single blinded orthopaedic surgeon. RESULTS When compared with tears left untreated or repaired with suture alone, augmented repairs demonstrated increased tissue formation in the meniscal tear site, as seen on MRI and macroscopically. Likewise, the neotissue of augmented repairs possessed a histological appearance more similar, although still inferior, to healthy meniscus. Osteochondral degeneration in the medial compartment, as evaluated by the Whole-Organ Magnetic Resonance Imaging Score and Inoue (macroscopic) scale, revealed increased degeneration in the untreated and repair groups, which was mitigated in the augmented repair group. Histological evaluation with a modified Mankin score showed a similar trend. In all measures of osteochondral degeneration, the augmented repair group did not differ significantly from the uninjured control. CONCLUSION A radial tear spanning 90% of the medial meniscal width in a goat stifle joint showed poor healing potential and resulted in osteochondral degeneration by 6 months, even if suture repair was performed. Augmentation of the repair with a photocrosslinkable hydrogel containing transforming growth factor β3 and SVF cells, isolated intraoperatively by rapid enzymatic digestion, improved meniscal healing and mitigated osteoarthritic changes. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Repair augmentation with an SVF cell-seeded hydrogel may support successful repair of meniscal tears previously considered irreparable.","Rothrauff, Benjamin B; Sasaki, Hiroshi; Kihara, Shinsuke; Overholt, Kalon J; Gottardi, Riccardo; Lin, Hang; Fu, Freddie H; Tuan, Rocky S; Alexander, Peter G",The American journal of sports medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/0363546519880468; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644307/,168

Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS PubMed, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and ASCO/ESMO conferences were searched up to March 2019 for RCTs on the curative treatment of esophageal or gastric cancer with data on prognostic and/or predictive factors for overall survival. Prognostic factors were deemed potentially clinically relevant according to the following criteria; (1) statistically significant (p < 0.05) in a multivariate analysis, (2) reported in at least 250 patients, and (3) p < 0.05, in ≥ 33% of the total number of patients in RCTs reporting this factor. Predictive factors were potentially clinically-relevant if (1) the p-value for interaction between subgroups was <0.20 and (2) the hazard ratio in one of the subgroups was significant (p < 0.05). RESULTS For gastric cancer, 39 RCTs were identified (n = 13,530 patients) and, for esophageal cancer, 33 RCTs were identified (n = 8618 patients). In total, we identified 23 potentially clinically relevant prognostic factors for gastric cancer and 16 for esophageal cancer. There were 15 potentially clinically relevant predictive factors for gastric cancer and 10 for esophageal cancer. CONCLUSION The identified prognostic and predictive factors can be included and analyzed in future RCTs and be of guidance for nomograms. Further validation should be performed in large patient cohorts.","van den Ende, Tom; Ter Veer, Emil; Mali, Rosa M A; van Berge Henegouwen, Mark I; Hulshof, Maarten C C M; van Oijen, Martijn G H; van Laarhoven, Hanneke W M",Cancers,https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers11040530; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31013858/,168

AIMS A cross-sectional study design using Cross's nigrescence theory as a framework was used to explore the relationship between Black racial identity and PPDS. METHOD Black mothers were administered online questionnaires via Qualtrics. A total sample of 116 self-identified Black mothers were enrolled in the study. Participants ranged in age from 18 to 41 years (M = 29.5 ± 5.3) and their infants were 1 to 12 months old (M = 5.6 ± 3.5). The majority of mothers were married or cohabitating with their partner (71%), had a college degree (53%), and worked full-time (57%). RESULTS Hierarchical cluster analysis identified six racial identity clusters within the sample: Assimilated and Miseducated, Self-Hating, Anti-White, Multiculturalist, Low Race Salience, and Conflicted. A Kruskal-Wallis H test determined there was no difference in PPDS scores between racial identity clusters. CONCLUSION This study is the first to explore the relationship between Black racial identity clusters of postpartum mothers and their mental health. Findings emphasize the complexity of Black racial identity and suggest that the current assessment tools may not adequately detect PPDS in Black mothers. The implications for these findings in nursing practice and future research are discussed.","Floyd James, Kortney; Aycock, Dawn M; Barkin, Jennifer L; Hires, Kimberly A",Journal of the American Psychiatric Nurses Association,https://doi.org/10.1177/10783903211002650; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33769104/,168

The transrectal route could be used in a similar way; however, suitable devices facilitating feasible transrectal access and rectal sealing are lacking. METHODS In collaboration with Karl Storz GmbH, we tailored a rectoscope and trocars to facilitate transrectal trocar placement and rectal sealing for hybrid NOTES procedures using rigid instruments. Five German Landrace pigs underwent transrectal hybrid NOTES cholecystectomy using the new devices. In a second experiment, the transferability to human anatomy was assessed in a human cadaver. RESULTS Using the new devices, transrectal trocar placement and rectal sealing proved to be feasible in both experiments. Transrectal hybrid NOTES cholecystectomy could be performed without complications. CONCLUSION The presented devices provide a tailored operating platform allowing precise transrectal trocar insertion and feasible sealing of the rectotomy. Consequently, these new instruments may pave the way for transrectal hybrid NOTES procedures and could succeed to clinical use in future.","Senft, Jonas D; Gath, Philip; Dröscher, Tilman; Müller, Philip C; Carstensen, Benedict; Nickel, Felix; Müller-Stich, Beat P; Linke, Georg R",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-016-4756-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27059964/,168

DESIGN Retrospective, nonrandomized clinical study (Canadian Task Force classification II-2). SETTING Four tertiary care academic medical centers. PATIENTS Women undergoing LESS for a benign or malignant gynecologic indication from 2009 to 2011. INTERVENTIONS A total of 211 women underwent LESS via a single 1.5- to 2.0-cm umbilical incision. All surgeries were performed by advanced gynecologic laparoscopists. Incisions were repaired with a running, delayed absorbable suture. Subject demographics and clinical variables were collected and surgical outcomes analyzed. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Median age and body mass index were 45 years and 30 kg/m(2), respectively. Approximately half of study subjects underwent a hysterectomy with or without salpingo-oophorectomy, and 15% had a diagnosis of cancer. Overall, 0.9% of women were diagnosed with a preoperative umbilical hernia, and 2.4% of women experienced a major perioperative complication. After a median postoperative follow-up time of 16 months, 2.4% had development of an umbilical hernia. However, 4/5 of these women had significant risk factors for fascial weakening independent of LESS, including requirement for a second abdominal surgery in 1 subject and a cancer diagnosis with postoperative chemotherapy administration in 2 subjects. When these subjects deemed ""high risk"" for incisional disruption were excluded from the analysis, the umbilical hernia rate was 0.5% (1/207). On univariable analysis, obesity was the only factor associated with complications (p = .04). CONCLUSION When performed by advanced laparoscopic surgeons, laparoendoscopic single-site gynecologic surgery is associated with a low risk of major adverse events. Additionally, the overall umbilical hernia rate was 2.4% and was lower (0.5%) in subjects without significant comorbidities.","Gunderson, Camille C; Knight, Jason; Ybanez-Morano, Jessica; Ritter, Carol; Escobar, Pedro F; Ibeanu, Okechukwu; Grumbine, Francis C; Bedaiwy, Mohamed A; Hurd, William W; Fader, Amanda Nickles",Journal of minimally invasive gynecology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmig.2011.09.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22033285/,168

METHOD We conducted a cross-sectional study on March 29 to April 5, 2020 based on a national online survey using snowball sampling techniques. A list of emotional states was compared in HCW and non-HCW and within HCW roles. The relationship between COVID-19 related symptoms, information, and protective measures and the emotional state was analyzed. RESULTS Fear (p < .001, φc = .11), irritability (p = .001, φc = .08), frustration (p < .001, φc = .10), anger (p = .013, φc = .06), and helplessness (p < .001, φc = .13) appear significantly more frequently in HCW compared to non-HCW. Within HCW, a higher percentage of physicians, especially the less experienced, significantly perceived uncertainty and frustration (p = .001, φc = .13 and p = .025, φc = .10, respectively), while a higher percentage of nurses significantly experienced sadness (p = .024, φc = .10). Having a confirmatory diagnosis of the disease was related to hypochondria sensation (p = .026, φc = .10). Sadness (p = .035, φc = .09), intolerance (p = .058, φc = .09), anger (p = .024, φc = .10), and helplessness (p = .028, φc = .10) appeared as the most relevant emotions when information was perceived as insufficient. CONCLUSIONS The knowledge of the most prevalent different emotional patterns in HCW, as well as in the general population, will allow the detection of subjects at risk for the development of mental disorders and the implementation of therapeutic approaches in future similar situations of pandemic or outbreak of the current one.

Immune checkpoint inhibition reactivates immunity against tumors that escaped immune surveillance in approximately 30% of cases. Recent studies demonstrated poorer response rates in female and younger patients. Although immune responses differ with sex and age, the role of MHC-based immune selection in this context is unknown. We find that tumors in younger and female individuals accumulate more poorly presented driver mutations than those in older and male patients, despite no differences in MHC genotype. Younger patients show the strongest effects of MHC-based driver mutation selection, with younger females showing compounded effects and nearly twice as much MHC-II based selection. This study presents evidence that strength of immune selection during tumor development varies with sex and age, and may influence the availability of mutant peptides capable of driving effective response to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.","Castro, Andrea; Pyke, Rachel Marty; Zhang, Xinlian; Thompson, Wesley Kurt; Day, Chi-Ping; Alexandrov, Ludmil B; Zanetti, Maurizio; Carter, Hannah",Nature communications,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-17981-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32807809/,168

Furthermore, long-term effects of early satiety, dysphagia, sustained weight loss, and difficulty in maintaining a healthy weight, dumping syndrome, and intestinal overgrowth are not unusual. Although the alternative of untreated cancer is clearly unacceptable, these lifestyle consequences are not benign. Methods A retrospective review of patients who had undergone laparoscopic total and proximal gastrectomy for gastric adenocarcinoma was conducted. Patient demographic data, pathologic parameters, and short-term and long-term clinical data were compared between total gastrectomy and proximal gastrectomy cohorts. Results Seventeen patients were included in the study: 13 had undergone laparoscopic total gastrectomy (LTG) and 4 had undergone laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy (LPG). Patients who had LPG, given the nature of the procedure, were confined to early stage (up to T2) tumors in the gastric cardia or GE junction. Patients who had LTG tended to be larger, later stage tumors (but not exclusively). The mean operative time was greater for LTG than for LPG (247 ± 54 versus 181 ± 49 min, respectively, P = .036). Length of hospital stay (9.0 ± 3.2 versus 5.0 ± 0.8 days, P < .001) and readmission for postoperative complication (38.5 versus 0%, P = .009) were also higher in the LTG group. There was no significant difference in terms of mean estimated blood loss or blood transfusion rates, overall complications, or anastomotic stricture requiring endoscopic dilation between the patients who underwent LTG and those who underwent LPG. Conclusion In early stage tumors (T1b or T2), proximal gastrectomy (PG) should be considered to mitigate diminished quality of life. PG with esophagogastrostomy, which can easily be performed minimally invasively, can be more tolerable for the patient, with no anatomic basis for dumping syndrome or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), and a greater reservoir for more normal meal habits when compared to total gastrectomy (TG) with Roux-en-Y reconstruction.","Schrope, Beth; Coons, Barbara; Rosario, Vilma; Toledano, Sabrina",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.4293/jsls.2021.00017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34483639/,168

This article develops analytical tools to investigate the neural adaptive tracking control of the hybrid Markovian switching networks with heterogeneous nonlinear dynamics and randomly switched topologies. A gradient-descent adaptation law built on neural networks (NNs) is presented for efficient distributed adaptive control. It is shown that the proposed control scheme can guarantee a stable closed-loop error system for any positive control gain and tuning gain. The tracking error is demonstrated to be practically uniformly exponentially stable with a threshold in the mean-square sense. This study further reveals how the topological structure affects the NN function, by measuring the influence of the switched topologies on the learning performance.","Hu, Bin; Yu, Xinghuo; Guan, Zhi-Hong; Kurths, Jurgen; Chen, Guanrong",IEEE transactions on neural networks and learning systems,https://doi.org/10.1109/tnnls.2020.3001009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32568715/,168

The model incorporates realistic descriptions of the virus genotypes in nucleotide and amino acid sequence spaces, as well as their diversification from error-prone replications. It quantitatively considers factors such as target cell number, bottleneck size, passage period, infection and cell death rates, and the replication rate of different genotypes, allowing for systematic examinations of how their changes affect the evolutionary dynamics of viruses during passages. The relative probability for a viral population to achieve adaptation under a new host environment, quantified by the rate with which a target sequence frequency rises above 50%, was found to be most sensitive to factors related to sequence structure (distance from the wild type to the target) and selection strength (host cell number and bottleneck size). For parameter values representative of RNA viruses, the likelihood of observing adaptations during passages became negligible as the required number of mutations rose above two amino acid sites. We modeled the specific adaptation process of influenza A H5N1 viruses in mammalian hosts by simulating the evolutionary dynamics of H5 strains under the fitness landscape inferred from multiple sequence alignments of H3 proteins. In light of comparisons with experimental findings, we observed that the evolutionary dynamics of adaptation is strongly affected not only by the tendency toward increasing fitness values but also by the accessibility of pathways between genotypes constrained by the genetic code.","Woo, Hyung Jun; Reifman, Jaques",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02958-13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24198414/,168

Pharmaceutical therapy is a valuable component of conservative obesity therapy. Herein, medications currently in the phase of preclinical or clinical testing are reviewed, along with an overview of the mechanisms that regulate energy intake and expenditure. In addition, the current and potential future directions of obesity drug therapy are discussed. RECENT FINDINGS Although the current arsenal of obesity pharmacotherapy is limited, a considerable number of agents that exert their actions through a variety of pharmacodynamic targets and mechanisms are in the pipeline. This expansion shapes a potential near future of obesity conservative management, characterized by tailored combined therapeutic regimens, targeting not only weight loss but also improved overall health outcomes. The progress regarding the elucidation of the mechanisms which regulate the bodily energy equilibrium has led to medications which mimic hormonal adaptations that follow bariatric surgery, in the quest for a ""Medical bypass.""

The aim of this report is to describe the activity of Bergamo Teratology Information Service (TIS) in supporting the public and health-care personnel in case of drug prescriptions in suspected/confirmed COVID-19 pregnant and lactating patients during COVID-19 outbreak in Italy. Methods All Bergamo TIS requests concerning COVID-19 pregnant and lactating women have been retrospectively evaluated from 1 March to 15 April 2020. Type of medications, drug's safety profile and compatibility with pregnancy and lactation are reported. Results Our service received information calls concerning 48 (9 pregnant, 35 lactating) patients. Among pregnant and lactating women, the requests of information were related to 16 and 60 drugs prescriptions respectively. More than half concerned drugs prescriptions during the first and second trimester (13/16) and during the first six months of lactation (37/60). Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were the most involved. Conclusions Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin at dosages used for COVID-19 may be considered compatible and reasonably safe either in pregnancy and lactation. Antivirals may be considered acceptable in pregnancy. During lactation lopinavir and ritonavir probably exhibit some supportive data from literature that darunavir and cobicistat do not. Tocilizumab may be considered for COVID-19 treatment because no increased malformation rate were observed until now. However caution may be advised because human data are limited and the potential risk of embryo-fetal toxicity cannot be excluded.","Giampreti, Andrea; Eleftheriou, Georgios; Gallo, Mariapina; Butera, Raffaella; Contessa, Gioia; Faraoni, Lorella; Sangiovanni, Anna; Negri, Giulia; Falchi, Giovanna; Bacis, Giuseppe",Journal of perinatal medicine,https://doi.org/10.1515/jpm-2020-0339; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33055313/,168

In this study, we present the outlines of ethical thinking and the measures implemented to try to respect our basic values of care, in the specific environment of an oncology hospital. METHODS Our ethics committee created an ethical watch system based on 24/7 shifts to assist practitioners in their daily decisions. We discuss the challenges faced by patients with cancer during the pandemic, such as access to critical care and ethical dilemmas in the context of resource scarcity, as well as the issue of isolation of patients. We also debate the restrictions in access to oncology care in a health context strongly 'prioritised' against COVID-19. RESULTS In all areas of an ethical dilemma, either for sorting out access to critical care or for the dramatic consequences of prolonged isolation of patients, our common thread was our attempt to protect, whenever possible, the principles of deontological ethics by strictly resisting utilitarian pressure. Respecting democratic health decision-making processes is a cornerstone of ethically relevant decisions, including in the context of a sanitary crisis. CONCLUSION The role of an ethics committee related to real-life situations includes not only a reflexive perspective in respect of fundamental principles, but also the help to enlighten and resolve ethical dilemmas in complex clinical situations. This ethical watch team assists physicians in decision-making, promoting the supportive and palliative dimension of care with a holistic approach.","Blot, François; Dumont, Sarah N; Vigouret-Viant, Laurence; Verotte, Nelly; Rossignol, Julien; Rieutord, André; Fournier-Bidoz, Nathalie; De Jésus, Anne; Dauchy, Sarah; Chardonnet, Florent; Baldini, Capucine; Altea, Anna",BMJ supportive & palliative care,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjspcare-2020-002504; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32855231/,168
128814,The Mechanics of Seated and Nonseated Cycling at Very-High-Power Output: A Joint-level Analysis.,2020-01-28,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS Laparoscopic gastric resection is widely used for gastric submucosal tumors (SMTs). However, determining an appropriate resection line using only the laparoscopic approach is difficult. We developed a laparoscopic and endoscopic cooperative surgery (LECS) technique by combining laparoscopic gastric resection with endoscopic submucosal dissection, and we have used this procedure to resect gastric SMTs. In this study, the procedure is presented and its safety and feasibility for resecting gastric SMTs are evaluated. METHODS This retrospective study included 100 patients who underwent LECS for SMTs at the Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Cancer Institute, between June 2006 and November 2014. The demographics, tumor histopathologic characteristics, and operative and follow-up data were reviewed. RESULTS Complete resection with negative surgical margins was achieved in all patients, and LECS was performed regardless of tumor location. The mean operation time was 174.3 minutes, with an estimated blood loss of 16.3 mL. In addition, the mean time until the initiation of oral intake was 1.4 days, and the mean postoperative hospital stay was 8.4 days. Moreover, no local or distant tumor recurrence was observed. The only severe adverse event was leakage, which was observed in 1 patient. CONCLUSIONS LECS was performed with a reasonable operation time, low blood loss, and minimal adverse events. Therefore LECS is safe and feasible for resecting gastric SMTs.","Matsuda, Tatsuo; Hiki, Naoki; Nunobe, Souya; Aikou, Susumu; Hirasawa, Toshiaki; Yamamoto, Yorimasa; Kumagai, Koshi; Ohashi, Manabu; Sano, Takeshi; Yamaguchi, Toshiharu",Gastrointestinal endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gie.2015.11.040; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26684599/,168

This study assessed quality of life (QOL) and functional status outcomes for depressed patients after an acute course of TMS. METHODS Forty-two, U.S.-based, clinical TMS practice sites treated 307 outpatients with a primary diagnosis of MDD and persistent symptoms despite prior adequate antidepressant pharmacotherapy. Treatment parameters were based on individual clinical considerations and followed the labeled procedures for use of the approved TMS device. Patient self-reported QOL outcomes included change in the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) and the EuroQol 5-Dimensions (EQ-5D) ratings from baseline to end of the acute treatment phase. RESULTS Statistically significant improvement in functional status on a broad range of mental health and physical health domains was observed on the SF-36 following acute TMS treatment. Similarly, statistically significant improvement in patient-reported QOL was observed on all domains of the EQ-5D and on the General Health Perception and Health Index scores. Improvement on these measures was observed across the entire range of baseline depression symptom severity. CONCLUSION These data confirm that TMS is effective in the acute treatment of MDD in routine clinical practice settings.

The study of the transmetallation reaction between zinc and rhenium in Zn7-MT1 by means of UV-vis and CD spectroscopy demonstrated the incorporation of the {fac-Re(CO)3}(+) fragment to the MTs. This reaction should be performed at 70 °C to accelerate the reaction rate, a result that is consistent with the reported reactivity of the rhenium fragment. ESI-TOF MS demonstrated the formation of mixed-metal species as Zn6,{Re(CO)3}-MT, Zn6,{Re(CO)3}2-MT, and Zn5,{Re(CO)3}3-MT, as well as the different reactivity of the four MT isoforms. Hence, Zn-MT3 showed the highest reactivity, in agreement with its high Cu-thionein character, whereas Zn-MT2 exhibited the lowest reactivity, in line with its high Zn-thionein character. The reactivity of the Zn-loaded forms of MT1 and MT4 is intermediate between those of MT3 and MT2. The study of the binding of the {fac-(99)Tc(CO)3}(+) fragment to MTs showed a significant and very interesting different reactivity in relation to rhenium. The transmetallation reaction is much more effective with technetium than with rhenium and significant amounts of mixed Zn x ,{(99)Tc(CO)3} y -MT species were formed with the four MT isoforms whereas only MT3 rendered similar amounts of rhenium derivatives. The results obtained in this study support the possible use of technetium for labelling mammalian metallothioneins and also for possible radiopharmaceutical applications.","Lecina, Joan; Palacios, Òscar; Atrian, Sílvia; Capdevila, Mercè; Suades, Joan",Journal of biological inorganic chemistry : JBIC : a publication of the Society of Biological Inorganic Chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00775-014-1226-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25511253/,168

Recently, midregional (MR) proadrenomedullin (proADM) has been shown to be of potential prognostic use. We sought to determine whether this prognostic role depends on the cause of CAP. We conducted a prospective cohort study of immunocompetent patients with CAP. Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) and CURB-65 score (confusion (abbreviated mental test score of ≤ 8), urea ≥ 7 mol · L(-1), respiratory rate ≥ 30 breaths · min(-1), blood pressure <90 mmHg systolic or <60 mmHg diastolic, and age ≥ 65 yrs), blood C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, MR-proADM, and microbiological studies were systematically performed. Patients were grouped as bacterial, viral/atypical and mixed CAP, and were followed up at 30, 90 and 180 days, and 1 yr. We recruited 228 CAP patients. Identification of at least one pathogen was achieved in 155 (68%) patients. MR-proADM levels closely correlated with increasing severity scores, and showed an important predictive power for complications and short- and long-term mortality (1 yr). Its addition to PSI and CURB-65 significantly improved their prognostic accuracy. A MR-proADM cut-off of 0.646 nmol · L(-1) identified 92% of patients scored as PSI classes IV and V as high risk. MR-proADM outcome prediction power was not affected by different aetiologies. MR-proADM has high short- and long-term prognostic accuracy, and increases the accuracy of clinical scores.

We report the total laparoscopic modified Duhamel operation for megacolon in combination with transanal endoscopic microsurgery for transanal specimen retrieval and anastomosis to avoid the additional abdominal extraction incision. CASE DESCRIPTION Two cases are presented: case 1 was a 15-year-old boy who presented with intermittent abdominal distention, pain, and constipation for 3 years' duration and was diagnosed with Hirschsprung disease, and case 2 was a 60-year-old man who presented with repeated attacks of incomplete intestinal obstruction for 2 years' duration and was diagnosed with adult megacolon. They were treated by the total laparoscopic modified Duhamel operation without an abdominal extraction incision in combination with transanal endoscopic microsurgery. The operations were successfully accomplished without conversion to open surgery. The patients tolerated the procedure well, complained of minimal postoperative pain, and did not require narcotics beyond the day of the operation. No surgical complications occurred. Discharge from the hospital occurred on the ninth postoperative day in case 1 and the 13th postoperative day in case 2. DISCUSSION The total laparoscopic modified Duhamel operation in combination with transanal endoscopic microsurgery is a feasible and minimally invasive technique for idiopathic megacolon and adult megacolon. This advanced surgical technique was developed by combining laparoscopy with the concept of natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery.","Han, Yi; Lin, Mou-Bin; Zhang, Ya-Jie; Yin, Lu",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.4293/108680813x13693422520288; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24680156/,168

Dietary habits changed rapidly in the last decades and few data are available on recent dietary changes in children and adolescents with T1D. OBJECTIVE To test the hypothesis that diet composition changed in a 10-year period in children and adolescents with T1D. METHODS 229 T1D subjects (M/F:121/108) aged 6-16 years were recruited: 114 (group A) enrolled in 2009, not using CGM and/or CSII, and 115 (group B) enrolled in 2019. Anthropometric, biochemical (HbA1c, lipid profile), diet and insulin therapy parameters were compared between the two groups. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed with HbA1c as dependent variable (HbA1c > 58 mmol/mol = 1) and nutritional variables and technology use as independent ones. RESULTS Energy intake of group A was not statistically different from that of group B. Group B had a significantly (p < 0.001) higher protein and lipids intake and lower total carbohydrate and fiber intake than group A. HbA1c was significantly (p < 0.01) lower in group B than in group A. Logistic regression analysis showed that MUFA (OR 0.83,95%CI:0.693-0.998), fiber intake (OR 0.82,95%CI:0.699-0.0969), and technology use (OR 0.15,95%CI:0.031-0.685), adjusted for age, gender, BMI, energy intake and diabetes duration, were were associated with a HbA1c higher than 58 mmol/mol) (R2 = 0.27, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS In a 10-year period, diet composition of children and adolescents with T1D changed and glucometabolic control improved. Fiber and MUFA intake showed a positive effect on HbA1c, independent from technology use, supporting the importance of educating children with T1D and families to maintain healthy eating habits.

We identified a high level of potential contact between dog-owning households; most households walked their dogs in only a few areas but a small number visited many. Highly connected households were more likely to have multiple dogs, walk their dogs off lead, and own Working, Pastoral or some Terrier types. Similarly, most areas were only visited by a few households but a few were visited by many. Despite identification of subgroups of households and locations, we demonstrated high connectivity between dog-owning households, with minimum path lengths of two 'steps' (household-area-household, 74%) or four 'steps' (via two areas, 26%).","Westgarth, C; Gaskell, R M; Pinchbeck, G L; Bradshaw, J W S; Dawson, S; Christley, R M",Epidemiology and infection,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0950268808001544; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19017431/,168
139831,"Global rules for global health: why we need an independent, impartial WHO.",2014,"Over the past three months, the world has faced an unprecedented health hazard. The World Health Organization has announced a pandemic infection with an unknown species of coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. Spreading mainly through the droplet route, the virus causes mild symptoms in the majority of cases, the most common being: fever (80%), dry cough (56%), fatigue (22%) and muscle pain (7%); less common symptoms include a sore throat, a runny nose, diarrhea, hemoptysis and chills. A life-threatening complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection is an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which occurs more often in older adults, those with immune disorders and co-morbidities. Severe forms of the infection, being an indication for treatment in the intensive care unit, comprise acute lung inflammation, ARDS, sepsis and septic shock. The article presents basic information about etiology, pathogenesis and diagnostics (with particular emphasis on the importance of tomocomputer imaging), clinical picture, treatment and prevention of the infection. It goes on to emphasize the specific risks of providing anesthesiology and intensive care services. Due to the fact that effective causal treatment is not yet available and the number of infections and deaths increases day by day, infection prevention and strict adherence to recommendations of infection control organizations remain the basis for fighting the virus.","Wujtewicz, Magdalena; Dylczyk-Sommer, Anna; Aszkiełowicz, Aleksander; Zdanowski, Szymon; Piwowarczyk, Sebastian; Owczuk, Radoslaw",Anaesthesiology intensive therapy,https://doi.org/10.5114/ait.2020.93756; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32191830/,168

140612,How COVID-19 pandemic affected cancer progression: Three different scenarios evidenced by PET imaging.,2020-12-14,"OBJECTIVES Exposure to nature or to green space has positive mental health benefits. Closing of parks and green spaces during the COVID-19 pandemic has reduced options for mental health and well-being benefits and could have a greater impact on vulnerable populations, especially the elderly. The present study, therefore, explores the physiopsychological impacts of indirect contact with nature, using forest imagery, on the brain activity and autonomic nervous systems of elderly people. STUDY DESIGN A within-subject design experiment was used. METHODS Thirty-four participants aged 82.9 ± 0.78 years were asked to look at bamboo and urban images for 2 min. During the visual stimulation, α relative waves were measured using electroencephalography as an indicator of brain activity. Heart rate variability and skin conductance (SC) responses were utilized as indicators of arousal. Afterward, psychological responses were evaluated using the semantic differential and the Profile of Mood States questionnaires. RESULTS Visual stimulation with bamboo image induced a significant increase in α relative waves and parasympathetic nervous activity and a significant decrease in SC. In addition, a significant increase in perceptions of ""comfortable,"" ""relaxed,"" ""cheerful,"" and ""vigorous"" feelings was observed. CONCLUSIONS Indirect contact with nature enhances the physiological and psychological conditions of the elderly. Findings can be used to guide the new design, renewal, and modification of the living environments of the elderly and those who are unable to get outside.","Elsadek, Mohamed; Shao, Yuhan; Liu, Binyi",HERD,https://doi.org/10.1177/19375867211006654; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33827295/,168
140759,The patient-physician relationship: an account of the physician's perspective.,2020-06-30,"BACKGROUND Pandemics create challenges for medical centers, which call for innovative adaptations to care for patients during the unusually high census, to distribute stress and work hours among providers, to reduce the likelihood of transmission to health care workers, and to maximize resource utilization. METHODS We describe a multidisciplinary vascular access team's development to improve frontline providers' workflow by placing central venous and arterial catheters. Herein we describe the development, organization, and processes resulting in the rapid formation and deployment of this team, reporting on notable clinical issues encountered, which might serve as a basis for future quality improvement and investigation. We describe a retrospective, single-center descriptive study in a large, quaternary academic medical center in a major city. The COVID-19 vascular access team included physicians with specialized experience in placing invasive catheters and whose usual clinical schedule had been lessened through deferment of elective cases. The target population included patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 in the medical ICU (MICU) needing invasive catheter placement. The line team placed all invasive catheters on patients in the MICU with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS Primary data collected were the number and type of catheters placed, time of team member exposure to potentially infected patients, and any complications over the first three weeks. Secondary outcomes pertained to workflow enhancement and quality improvement. 145 invasive catheters were placed on 67 patients. Of these 67 patients, 90% received arterial catheters, 64% central venous catheters, and 25% hemodialysis catheters. None of the central venous catheterizations or hemodialysis catheters were associated with early complications. Arterial line malfunction due to thrombosis was the most frequent complication. Division of labor through specialized expert procedural teams is feasible during a pandemic and offloads frontline providers while potentially conferring safety benefits.","Nawathe, Pooja; Wong, Robert; Pollock, Gabriel; Green, Jack; Kissen, Michael; Ng, Phillip; Cohen, Samuel; Barron, Joel; Robert, Stephen; Slingwine, Christy; Frank, Paul; Navab, Kaveh; Kim, Doran; Yang, Michael; Gouvea, Tyler; Johnson, Calvin; Pedraza, Isabel; Zahn, Evan",The journal of vascular access,https://doi.org/10.1177/1129729821991754; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33541202/,168

145695,Traumatic dreams in a women's prison setting.,2021-07-29,"BACKGROUND Treatment of esophageal adenocarcinoma often involves surgical resection. Newer technologies in interventional endoscopy have led to a substantial paradigm shift in the management of early-stage neoplasia in Barrett's esophagus comprising high-grade dysplasia (HGD), intramucosal carcinoma, and, in some cases, submucosal carcinoma. However, there has been no consensus regarding the indications for esophageal preservation in these cases. In this work, consensus guidelines were established for the management of early-stage esophageal neoplasia considering clinically relevant aspects (age, comorbidities, and social environment) in each scenario. METHODS Seventeen experts were invited to participate based on their background and clinical expertise at high-volume centers. A questionnaire was created that included four clinical scenarios covering a wide range of situations within HGD and/or early esophageal neoplasia, particularly where controversies are likely to exist. Each of the clinical scenarios was open to discussion subdivided by patient age (20, 50, and 80 s). For each clinical scenario an expert was chosen to defend that position. Each defense triggered a subsequent discussion during a consensus meeting. Conclusions of that discussion together with an accompanying literature analysis allowed experts to confirm or change their original choices and served as the basis for the recommendations stated in this article. RESULTS There was 100 % consensus supporting esophageal preservation in patients with HGD, independent of patient age or Barrett's length. In patients with T1a adenocarcinoma, consensus for preservation was not reached (65 %) for young and middle-aged individuals but was supported for elderly patients (100 %). For T1b adenocarcinoma, consensus was reached for surgical resection (90 %), leaving organ preservation for patients with very low risk of nodal invasion or poor surgical candidates. CONCLUSION Advances in endoscopic imaging and therapy allow for organ preservation in most settings of early-stage neoplasia of the esophagus, provided that the patient understands the implications of this decision.","Nieponice, Alejandro; Badaloni, Adolfo E; Jobe, Blair A; Hoppo, Toshitaka; Pellegrini, Carlos; Velanovich, Vic; Falk, Gary W; Reavis, Kevin; Swanstrom, Lee; Sharma, Virender K; Nachman, Fabio; Ciotola, Franco F; Caro, Luis E; Cerisoli, Cecilio; Cavadas, Demetrio; Figueroa, Luis Durand; Pirchi, Daniel; Gibson, Michael; Elizalde, Santiago; Cohen, Henry",World journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-013-2235-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24101017/,168

The immune system uses it both as an effector mechanism to clear intracellular pathogens and as a mechanism to monitor its products for evidence of pathogen invasion and cellular transformation. Because autophagy delivers intracellular material for lysosomal degradation, its products are primarily loaded onto MHC class II molecules and are able to stimulate CD4+ T cells. This process might shape the self-tolerance of the CD4+ T cell repertoire and stimulate CD4+ T cell responses against pathogens and tumors. Beyond antigen processing, autophagy's role in cell survival is to assist the clonal expansion of B and T cells for efficient adaptive immune responses. These immune-enhancing functions make autophagy an attractive target for therapeutic manipulation in human disease.","Münz, Christian",Annual review of immunology,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.immunol.021908.132537; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19105657/,168

Seventy-four percent of the inmates were experiencing traumatic dreams at the time of the survey. Many (> 30%) experienced these nightly and as extreme (19%). Of inmates experiencing traumatic dreams, only about 50% were diagnosed with PTSD, and of these, 84% were willing to obtain treatment, not yet provided. CONCLUSIONS There is a high incidence in this women's prison of traumatic dreams. This is far more prevalent than the diagnosis of PTSD. This symptom may be undertreated by prison mental health professionals both behaviorally and pharmacologically and should become a mental health screening question on admission despite the presence or absence of a diagnosis of PTSD.

In this study, we sought to elucidate the pandemic's effects on mental health and access to care for perinatal individuals. METHODS This cross-sectional study of individuals in Massachusetts who were pregnant or up to three months postpartum with a history of depressive symptoms examined associations between demographics and psychiatric symptoms (via validated mental health screening instruments) and the COVID-19 pandemic's effects on mental health and access to care. Chi-square associations and multivariate regression models were used. RESULTS Of 163 participants, 80.8% perceived increased symptoms of depression and 88.8% of anxiety due to the pandemic. Positive screens for depression, anxiety, and/or PTSD at time of interview, higher education, and income were associated with increased symptoms of depression and anxiety due to the pandemic. Positive screens for depression, anxiety, and/or PTSD were also associated with perceived changes in access to mental healthcare. Compared to non-Hispanic White participants, participants of color (Black, Asian, Multiracial, and/or Hispanic/Latinx) were more likely to report that the pandemic changed their mental healthcare access (aOR:3.25, 95%CI:1.23, 8.59). LIMITATIONS Limitations included study generalizability, given that participants have a history of depressive symptoms, and cross-sectional design. CONCLUSIONS The pandemic has increased symptoms of perinatal depression and anxiety and impacted perceived access to care. Self-reported increases in depression and anxiety and changes to healthcare access varied by education, race/ethnicity, income, and positive screens. Understanding these differences is important to address perinatal mental health and provide equitable care.","Masters, Grace A; Asipenko, Eugenia; Bergman, Aaron L; Person, Sharina D; Brenckle, Linda; Moore Simas, Tiffany A; Ko, Jean Y; Robbins, Cheryl L; Byatt, Nancy",Journal of psychiatric research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.02.056; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33677216/,168

We aimed to determine how trends in neurology service admissions during the pandemic may aid in departmental planning by predicting future clinician staffing and other needs. We examined all admissions to the general neurology, stroke, and neurocritical care services from January 31 to May 16, 2020 at our tertiary-care hospital using an electronic health record query, comparing these to analogous data in 2019. We trended admission rates and projected future censuses using logarithmic regression, tracked changes in length of stay (LOS), and quantified shifts in presentations of specific diagnoses. Daily rates of admissions declined sharply during the week of March 13, 2020 (the week after pandemic status was declared by the World Health Organization). On the censoring date, we projected a return to pre-pandemic censuses in the week of June 21 and used this information to make decisions regarding neurology resident schedules. There was a trend toward increased LOS for general neurology and stroke patients between March 27 and April 9, 2020 compared to in 2019, with subsequent decline coinciding with early hospital initiatives. Since March 13, 2020, there has been a trend toward reduced presentations of ischemic stroke, suggesting a need for community education on stroke awareness. Characterizing early trends in neurology admissions may allow physician administrators to plan local and community-level responses to the pandemic.","Lau, K H Vincent; Anand, Pria; Greer, David M; Cervantes-Arslanian, Anna; Phicil, Sheila; Moore, Jesse; Takahashi, Courtney",The Neurohospitalist,https://doi.org/10.1177/1941874420960323; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33791055/,168

Our center is located in the south of Italy where the infection rates were low and the clusters of COVID-19 positive patients were small and inhomogeneous. The aim of this short report is to share our experience as a starting point for the management of the steady state of the pandemic. METHODS The safety of the patients and department staff required a strict plan to minimize the risk of infection between operators whose absence would have made it impossible to carry out the radiotherapy treatments. The head of the radiotherapy unit and members of the Hospital Crisis Unit have put in place a series of measures to manage the emergency. RESULTS A ""clean"" team has been established whose members are kept out of the radiotherapy unit for 2 weeks on rotation. Several separate work areas have been made in order to reduce direct contact between the staff. Each staff member has to wear protective equipment if close contact with patients is required. Before confirming a radiotherapy consult or a follow-up visit, telephone clinical and epidemiological screening is performed by nurses through a questionnaire regarding the presence of respiratory symptoms or eventual social contacts with COVID-19 positive people. Once the patients arrive in the hospital, a triage point at the entrance to the hospital performs a second screening and a temperature check. CONCLUSIONS This management experience of a radiotherapy unit in Southern Italy could serve as a useful example for the future. In fact, in the steady state of infection many centers may face epidemiologically contagious numbers similar to those that we currently have in our region. These numbers require the maintenance of alert and precautionary measures which in our case seem to have worked.","Pezzulla, Donato; Macchia, Gabriella; Taccari, Francesco; Sticca, Giovanna; Deodato, Francesco",International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,https://doi.org/10.1136/ijgc-2020-001523; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32448805/,168

The highly flexible S-protein, with its mobile domains, presents a moving target to the immune system. Here, to better understand S-protein mobility, we implemented a structure-based vector analysis of available β-CoV S-protein structures. Despite an overall similarity in domain organization, we found that S-proteins from different β-CoVs display distinct configurations. Based on this analysis, we developed two soluble ectodomain constructs for the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein, in which the highly immunogenic and mobile receptor binding domain (RBD) is either locked in the all-RBDs 'down' position or adopts 'up' state conformations more readily than the wild-type S-protein. These results demonstrate that the conformation of the S-protein can be controlled via rational design and can provide a framework for the development of engineered CoV S-proteins for vaccine applications.","Henderson, Rory; Edwards, Robert J; Mansouri, Katayoun; Janowska, Katarzyna; Stalls, Victoria; Gobeil, Sophie M C; Kopp, Megan; Li, Dapeng; Parks, Rob; Hsu, Allen L; Borgnia, Mario J; Haynes, Barton F; Acharya, Priyamvada",Nature structural & molecular biology,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41594-020-0479-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32699321/,168

ANIMAL STUDIED Six adult mixed-breed dogs (18-24 kg). PROCEDURES In a randomized, masked, crossover trial with a 10-day washout period, each dog was sedated with intravenously administered dexmedetomidine and administered 0.5% bupivacaine:iopamidol (4:1) as RBA (2 mL via a ventrolateral site) or PBA (5 mL divided equally between ventrolateral and dorsomedial sites). The contralateral eye acted as control. Injectate distribution was evaluated by computed tomography. Following intramuscularly administered atipamezole, corneal and periocular skin sensation, intraocular pressure (IOP), and ocular reflexes, and appearance were evaluated for 24 hours. Comparisons were performed with mixed-effects linear regression (IOP) or the exact Wilcoxon signed rank test (scores). Significance was set at P ≤ .05. RESULTS Injectate distribution was intraconal in 2/6 RBA- and 4/6 PBA-injected eyes. Eyes undergoing PBA had significantly reduced lateral, ventral, and dorsal periocular skin sensation for 2-3 hours, and significantly reduced corneal sensitivity for 4 hours, relative to control eyes. Chemosis and exophthalmos occurred in 33%-40% of eyes undergoing RBA and 83%-100% eyes undergoing PBA but resolved within 14 hours. Anterior uveitis developed in 2/6 and 1/6 eyes of RBA and PBA, respectively, of them corneal ulcer developed in one eye of each treatment. Both resolved 1-3 days following medical treatment. CONCLUSIONS Peribulbar injection produced notable anesthesia more reliably than did retrobulbar injection. Both techniques may produce adverse effects, although the uveitis/ulcer could have resulted from the contrast agent used.","Shilo-Benjamini, Yael; Pascoe, Peter J; Maggs, David J; Hollingsworth, Steven R; Strom, Ann R; Good, Kathryn L; Thomasy, Sara M; Kass, Philip H; Wisner, Erik R",Veterinary ophthalmology,https://doi.org/10.1111/vop.12579; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29762893/,168

METHODS SITS Open was a prospective, open, blinded evaluation, international, multicenter, controlled, nonrandomized registry study. Centers lacking access to thrombectomy contributed controls. Primary end point was categorical shift in modified Rankin Scale score at 3 months in the per protocol (PP) population. Principal secondary outcomes were symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, functional independency (modified Rankin Scale score 0-2) and death at 3 months. Patients independently evaluated by video-recorded modified Rankin Scale interviews blinded to treatment or center identity by central core laboratory were regarded as PP population. Propensity score matching with covariate adjusted analysis was performed. RESULTS During 2014 to 2017, 293 patients (257 thrombectomy, 36 control) from 26 centers in 10 countries fulfilled intention-to-treat and 200 (170 thrombectomy, 30 control) PP criteria; enrollment of controls was limited by rapid uptake of thrombectomy. In PP analysis, median age was 71 versus 71 years, and baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale 17 versus 17 in the thrombectomy and control arms, respectively. The propensity score matching analysis for PP showed a significant shift for modified Rankin Scale at 3 months favoring the thrombectomy group (odds ratio, 3.8 [95% CI, 1.61-8.95]; P=0.002). Regarding safety, there were 4 cases of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage in the thrombectomy group (2.4%) and none in the control group.

156807,Experiences at a Federally Qualified Health Center Support Expanded Conception of the Gifts of Precision Medicine.,2021-04-01,"To control the spread of COVID-19, China implemented a series of lockdowns, limiting various offline interactions. This provided an opportunity to study the response of air quality to emissions control. By comparing the characteristics of pollution in the summers of 2019 and 2020, we found a significant decrease in gaseous pollutants in 2020. However, particle pollution in the summer of 2020 was more severe; PM2.5 levels increased from 35.8 to 44.7 μg m-3, and PM10 increased from 51.4 to 69.0 μg m-3 from 2019 to 2020. The higher PM10 was caused by two sandstorm events on May 11 and June 3, 2020, while the higher PM2.5 was the result of enhanced secondary formation processes indicated by the higher sulfate oxidation rate (SOR) and nitrate oxidation rate (NOR) in 2020. Higher SOR and NOR were attributed mainly to higher relative humidity and stronger oxidizing capacity. Analysis of PMx distribution showed that severe haze occurred when particles within Bin2 (size ranging 1-2.5 μm) dominated. SO42-(1/2.5) and SO42-(2.5/10) remained stable under different periods at 0.5 and 0.8, respectively, indicating that SO42- existed mainly in smaller particles. Decreases in NO3-(1/2.5) and increases in NO3-(2.5/10) from clean to polluted conditions, similar to the variations in PMx distribution, suggest that NO3- played a role in the worsening of pollution. O3 concentrations were higher in 2020 (108.6 μg m-3) than in 2019 (96.8 μg m-3). Marked decreases in fresh NO alleviated the titration of O3. Furthermore, the oxidation reaction of NO2 that produces NO3- was dominant over the photochemical reaction of NO2 that produces O3, making NO2 less important for O3 pollution. In comparison, a lower VOC/NOx ratio (less than 10) meant that Beijing is a VOC-limited area; this indicates that in order to alleviate O3 pollution in Beijing, emissions of VOCs should be controlled.","Li, Hui; Ma, Yongliang; Duan, Fengkui; Zhu, Lidan; Ma, Tao; Yang, Shuo; Xu, Yunzhi; Li, Fan; Huang, Tao; Kimoto, Takashi; Zhang, Qinqin; Tong, Dan; Wu, Nana; Hu, Yunxing; Huo, Mingyu; Zhang, Qiang; Ge, Xiang; Gong, Wanru; He, Kebin",Environmental pollution,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.116923; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33751950/,168
159732,Exposure to air pollution near a steel plant and effects on cardiovascular physiology: a randomized crossover study.,2014,"Meaningful social interactions are a fundamental human need, the lack of which can pose serious risks to an individual's physical and mental health. Across species, peer-oriented social behaviors are dramatically reshaped during adolescence, a developmental period characterized by dynamic changes in brain structure and function as individuals transition into adulthood. Thus, the experience of social isolation during this critical developmental stage may be especially pernicious, as it could permanently derail typical neurobiological processes that are necessary for establishing adaptive adult behaviors. The purpose of this review is to summarize investigations in which rodents were isolated during adolescence, then re-housed in typical social groups prior to testing, thus allowing the investigators to resolve the long-term consequences of social adversity experienced during adolescent sensitive periods, despite subsequent normalization of the social environment. Here, we discuss alterations in social, anxiety-like, cognitive, and decision-making behaviors in previously isolated adult rodents. We then explore corresponding neurobiological findings, focusing on the prefrontal cortex, including changes in synaptic densities and protein levels, white matter and oligodendrocyte function, and neuronal physiology. Made more urgent by the recent wave of social deprivation resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, especially amongst school-aged adolescents, understanding the mechanisms by which even transient social adversity can negatively impact brain function across the lifespan is of paramount importance.","Li, Dan C; Hinton, Elizabeth A; Gourley, Shannon L",Seminars in cell & developmental biology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.semcdb.2021.05.017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34112579/,168

The present study investigated the self-categorised K-Pop fandom characteristics that predicted higher levels of K-Pop fanship, and subsequent psychosocial outcomes. Social identity theory was applied as a theoretical framework. In total, 1477 K-Pop fans from 92 predominantly Western countries fully completed an extensive online survey measuring fanship, fandom and psychosocial outcomes (happiness, self-esteem and social connectedness). Results of this study indicated that K-Pop fanship was significantly predicted by a several K-Pop demographic and fandom characteristics. K-Pop fanship was a significant predictor of increased happiness, self-esteem and social connectedness. The study findings advance the application of social identity theory in a K-Pop fan context and the psychological fanship research more broadly.","Laffan, Derek A",Psychological reports,https://doi.org/10.1177/0033294120961524; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32985364/,168

Multiconfigurational quantum chemical computations disclose the mechanism for this spin-forbidden process. Despite a negligible spin-orbit coupling constant, the intersystem crossing (ISC) is facilitated by singlet and triplet state degeneracy and spin-vibronic coupling. The formed peroxides are stable toward external substrates but undergo an unprecedented oxidative pyrrole α-cleavage by ligand aromatization/dearomatization-initiated O-O σ-bond scission. A detailed comparison of the calix[4]pyrrolato aluminates with dioxygen-related enzymology provides insights into the ISC of metal- or cofactor-free enzymes. It substantiates the importance of structural constraint and element-ligand cooperativity for the functions of aerobic life.","Sigmund, Lukas Maximilian; Ehlert, Christopher; Enders, Markus; Graf, Jürgen; Gryn'ova, Ganna; Greb, Lutz",Angewandte Chemie,https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202104916; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33955154/,168

This fact is mainly manifested in traditional farming settings (by sedentary, semi-sedentary, and nomadic communities) as well as where livestock intensification has been introduced. A combination of complex factors in these settings (e.g. challenges in country infrastructures and cross-sectoral collaboration/ coordination, traditional habits, poor social information, etc.) contribute to the emergence and, occasionally, to the endemic pattern of zoonoses. The phenomenal growth of international travel and trade, population displacement, and unhygienic settlements has increased the speed and ease with which pathogens and vectors can cross continents and cause outbreaks and epidemics. Programmes for the prevention and control of zoonoses have been implemented in several countries in this region; however, the expected results have not always been realised. The conflicts and civil unrest affecting certain countries in this region during the last decade, together with the mass displacement of people seeking refuge, have resulted in serious epidemiological and social impacts. Zoonoses and related food-borne diseases are, indeed, a worldwide challenge, whose prevention and control mainly depend on the actions of national authorities. Once peace has been established in this region, authorities need to address the burden of these diseases through resource mobilisation, the implementation of international agencies technical guidance, and inter-country collaboration.","Seimenis, Aristarchos; Battelli, Giorgio",Veterinaria italiana,https://doi.org/10.12834/vetit.1340.7765.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30019326/,168

We tested this proposed neural division of labour in adults through an investigation of the consolidation and long-term retention of newly-learned native vocabulary with post-learning functional neuroimaging. Newly-learned items were compared to two conditions: (i) previously known items to highlight the similarities and differences with established vocabulary; and (ii) unknown/untrained items to provide a control for non-specific perceptual and motor-speech output. Consistent with the CLS, retrieval of newly-learned items was supported by a combination of regions associated with episodic memory (including left hippocampus) and the language-semantic areas that support established vocabulary (left inferior frontal gyrus and left anterior temporal lobe). Furthermore, there was a shifting division of labour across these two networks in line with the items’ consolidation status; faster naming was associated with more activation of language-semantic areas and lesser activation of episodic memory regions. Hippocampal activity during naming predicted more than half the variation in naming retention six months later.","Gore, Katherine R.; Woollams, Anna M.; Bruehl, Stefanie; Halai, Ajay D.; Lambon Ralph, Matthew A.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.12.439443,168

We describe the early results of iSeeMammals, a citizen science project that collects opportunistic data on the black bear population in New York State by enlisting volunteers to collect data through observations, hikes, and trail cameras. In 10 months, iSeeMammals increased the spatio-temporal extent of data collection by approximately fourfold and reduced cost by 83% compared to systematic sampling. In combination with other datasets in integrated population model frameworks, large, spatiotemporally extensive datasets from citizen science projects like iSeeMammals can help improve inferences about population-level structure and dynamics.","Sun, Catherine C.; Fuller, Angela K.; Hurst, Jeremy E.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/352708,168

Blended learning by combining face-to-face with online training, may help achieve BLS competencies for health care professionals, including nursing students. This systematic review was conducted to explore blended learning effectiveness in BLS training for nursing student populations. The electronic search strategy was conducted from PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane for the years 2010 to 2020 with full text in English. This review followed the PRISMA guidelines. The initial search yielded 240 studies, and six of those studies were eventually included. The results reported there were three blended learning models appeared, including face to face learning combined with e-learning website, combined with video-based, and combined with computer-based simulations. With an intervention duration of four hours to two weeks, there was an indication of several improving outcomes, including skills, knowledge, attitudes, self-efficacy, problem-solving abilities, and willingness to perform resuscitation. Furthermore, the skill outcome is significantly more effective in blended learning of face-to-face models combined with the e-learning website and combined with computer-based simulations. The knowledge outcome parameter likely is the most effective from all of three blended learning models. These findings imply that BLS training needs to use blended learning models by modifying the training modules, facilities, and infrastructure as consideration.","Mulyadi, M.; Lea, B. O.; Malara, R.

Previous proof of formal reductive incompleteness and necessary meta-consideration in determining reductive logical consistency, permits the meta-construction of adjacent possible meta-reductive paradigms. An imagined Meta-Reductive Paradigm then allows for a search in an adjacent possible conceptual space, beyond the boundary of the Reductive Paradigm, looking for possible adaptations that might enhance the resilience of individual and community level responses to the Covid-19 pandemic and economic crisis. Unrecognized formal incompleteness of reductive scientific Logic is related to the unresolved integration of Reductive Science and Complexity Science. The lack of integration of these two broad areas of scientific interest, is in part associated with a diminished interest in formal reductive logic and its properties, particularly in the Complexity Sciences. The failure to sustain a strong link to rigorous reductive logic could indirectly relate to diminished public trust in scientific and medical information, with consequent political failure to effectively integrate scientific and medical advice in response to the Covid-19 situation. Careful meta-consideration reveals a subtle way to address formal reductive incompleteness and meta-construct an adjacent possible Meta-reductive CAS Model (MCAS) and Meta-reductive Paradigm (MRP). The strong link to logic and differentiated truth and proof in the proposed MCAS and MRP can integrate willful, intentional, brain, mind and consciousness in Nature, as well as spell-out a number of scientific and social adaptations that could improve the integration of medical and scientific information in the political management of the Covid-19 crisis, increasing the chance that humanity will be better prepared for the next pandemic or next urgent global crisis. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Scott, J.

In the present study, an attempt has been made to study the change in water quality of the river in terms of turbidity purely through remote sensing data, in the absence of ground observations, especially during this time period. The change in spectral reflectance of water along the river in the visible region has been analyzed using the Sentinel-2 multispectral remote sensing data at Haridwar, Kanpur, Prayagraj, and Varanasi stretches of the river. In the present study, it was found that the red and NIR bands are most sensitive, and can be used to estimate the turbidity. Further, the temporal variation in turbidity was also analyzed through normalized difference turbidity index at each location. It was observed that the turbidity in the river has reduced drastically at each stretch of the river. The study elicited that the remote sensing approach can be used to make qualitative estimates on turbidity, even in the absence of field observations.","Vaibhav, Garg Aggarwal S.

This study responded to this gap by exploring and examining the meanings around webinars as capacity-building for professionals from the point of view of the teachers. Guided by the post-modern, constructivist philosophical stance, interpretive hermeneutic phenomenology research design, and the interpretive analysis of qualitative data, the virtual face-to-face interview of the purposively selected 35 teachers revealed four overarching themes: (1) Webinars as vital space for formal professional deliberations;(2) Webinars as matters of personal, environmental, technical, and financial tolls;(3) Webinars as prevue of what lies ahead in the new normal of education;and (4) Webinars as the lifeblood in facing the new normal of education. Overall, the themes purport that despite the different issues that teachers encountered in the navigation of webinar complexities, their learning and discovery, cultivated connections, and developed hope for the newer education system and continued professional growth in the future, are what makes webinars their lifeblood in facing the new normal of education. These findings can help human resource development personnel craft webinar training plans and protocols that are congruous to the present situations, common interests, and nature of professional teachers. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press","Tanucan, J.

The main sample participants were healthcare CEOs, senior managers/managers, doctors, nurses, and other relevant healthcare practitioners under the MoH involved in the decision-making process relating to COVID-19. The measurement model was validated using SEM analyses. Empirical results largely supported the conceptual model proposed as all research hypotheses are significantly approved. This study makes several theoretical contributions. For example, it expands the theoretical horizon of Shaft and Vessey's (2006) CFT by considering new mechanisms, such as the inclusion of G2G Knowledge-based Exchange in addition to the moderation effect of Experience-based decision-making (EDBM) for enhancing the decision-making process related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

STUDY DESIGN: An observation study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Intensive care units (ICU) of Sakarya University Training and Research Hospital, Sakarya, Turkey, from October 2020 to December 2020. METHODOLOGY: The data of 149 patients, who were admitted to the ICU were collected and analysed retrospectively. Routine blood samples were collected from all patients at the time of admission to the ICU; and 102 patients with the mortal course and 47 patients with the non-mortal course were included in the study. The data obtained from these patients were analyzed in the biostatistics programme. Results: The median age of all patients was 68 years; while 94 of them were males (63.1%) and 55 of them were females (36.9%). Median levels of potassium (K) (p=0.04), uric acid (p=0.001), C-reactive protein (CRP) (p=0.004), and procalcitonin (PCT) (p<0.001) were significantly higher and median level of prealbumin (p=0.002) was significantly lower in the deceased group. The cut-off level of prealbumin for mortality was found as 0.085 g/L (p=0.002). Further analysis revealed that the risk of mortality was found as 2.193 times more in patients with prealbumin levels of <0.085 g/L (Odds Ratio (OR): 2.193, 95% CI: 1.084-4.434). CONCLUSION: As a result of this study, it was found that patients with lower levels of prealbumin at the time of admission to the ICU have a higher risk for mortality.

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of underlying diseases and associated comorbidities in COVID-19 patients using a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: Major biomedical electronic databases, including Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL and EMBASE were searched for all relevant literature published in English from January to July 2020. Cross-sectional and retrospective studies reporting the prevalence of comorbid conditions such as acute cardiac injury, acute myocardial infarction, acute kidney injury, acute liver injury, shock, acute respiratory disease, and acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients with COVID-19 were included in the study. After selecting eligible studies, two authors extracted data of each study, independently, and any inconsistency was resolved through discussion with the third reviewer until reaching a consensus. The risk of bias was assessed by two independent research experts using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). The variance in the meta-analyses on prevalence was stabilized by double arcsine transformations. RESULTS: The pooled prevalence of acute respiratory injury in patients with COVID-19 was estimated as 34% (95% Cl: 10 – 57%). Also, the prevalence of acute kidney injury, acute liver injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and shock were estimated as 10% (95% Cl: 6 - 14%), 19% (95% Cl: 10 - 27%), 23 % (95% Cl: 19 - 27%), and 12 % (95% Cl: 5 – 19 %). CONCLUSION: According to this meta-analysis, comorbidities such as hypertension, acute liver and kidney injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, shock, diabetes, and coronary heart disease seem to be a predisposing factor for symptomatic and severe COVID-19 infection.","Khateri, Sorour; Mohammadi, Hedyeh; Khateri, Rozhin; Moradi, Yousef",Arch Acad Emerg Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7588001/,168
187363,Ochratoxin a: its cancer risk and potential for exposure.,2006,"The human oncogene beta-catenin is a bifunctional protein with critical roles in both cell adhesion and transcriptional regulation in the Wnt pathway. Wnt/beta-catenin signalling has been implicated in developmental processes as diverse as elaboration of embryonic polarity, formation of germ layers, neural patterning, spindle orientation and gap junction communication, but the ancestral function of beta-catenin remains unclear. In many animal embryos, activation of beta-catenin signalling occurs in blastomeres that mark the site of gastrulation and endomesoderm formation, raising the possibility that asymmetric activation of beta-catenin signalling specified embryonic polarity and segregated germ layers in the common ancestor of bilaterally symmetrical animals. To test whether nuclear translocation of beta-catenin is involved in axial identity and/or germ layer formation in 'pre-bilaterians', we examined the in vivo distribution, stability and function of beta-catenin protein in embryos of the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis (Cnidaria, Anthozoa). Here we show that N. vectensis beta-catenin is differentially stabilized along the oral-aboral axis, translocated into nuclei in cells at the site of gastrulation and used to specify entoderm, indicating an evolutionarily ancient role for this protein in early pattern formation.","Wikramanayake, Athula H; Hong, Melanie; Lee, Patricia N; Pang, Kevin; Byrum, Christine A; Bince, Joanna M; Xu, Ronghui; Martindale, Mark Q",Nature,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14647383/,168

Surgery is currently the most important treatment of choice for transplant patients with resectable CRC. However, conventional open surgery represents a great risk to these high-risk patients. They seem to benefit more from laparoscopic surgery, based on the favorable oncological outcome and remarkable short-term advantages of this approach. PATIENT CONCERNS In this study, we have reported a case of a 50-year-old man who had underwent kidney transplantation for 4 years. He presented with recurrent hematochezia and frequent loose stools for 1 year, and consulted a doctor for recent progressive general malaise and weight loss. DIAGNOSES Colonoscopy revealed a near-circumferential mass at the middle rectum about 8 cm from anal verge. Further biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma. Following computed tomography demonstrated peripheral lymph node metastasis, but no signs of distant metastasis. INTERVENTIONS The patient underwent a laparoscopic assisted low anterior resection with total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer. Concomitantly, a loop transverse colostomy was performed to prevent anastomotic leakage. The surgery was completed within 120 min with a blood loss of 100 mL, and immunosuppressive therapy was not stopped perioperatively. Considering the tumor stage of pT3N1M0, the patient also received adjuvant chemotherapy with a regimen of FOLFOX for 8 cycles. OUTCOMES Anastomotic bleeding occurred in this patient about 4 h after surgery, and a control of hemorrhage per anus was performed timely. The following postoperative course was uneventful without any complications, and graft function stayed well. After 4 months of follow-up period, the patient was in a good condition. No evidences of local recurrence and distant metastasis were found. CONCLUSION We have presented a case of successful laparoscopic resection for advanced rectal cancer in a kidney transplant recipient. We believe laparoscopic surgery for CRC in transplant recipients is technically feasible and oncologically safe, which could be a preferred option of surgical procedure in the near future.","Xia, Zenan; Chen, Weijie; Yao, Ru; Lin, Guole; Qiu, Huizhong",Medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27858861/,168
189153,Global health surveillance.,2012,"The objective of this investigation was to determine the distribution of Bredavirus in cattle herds in Lower Saxony and to evaluate its significance as potential cause of diarrhea in calves. Fecal samples and paired blood samples of 119 diarrheic and 46 healthy calves up to two months of age were collected from herds where diarrhea of calves was a problem. Fecal samples were examined for Breda-, rota- and coronavirus by solid phase immune electron microscopy and by ELISA, for K99-positive E. coli and salmonella by microbiological methods, and for cryptosporidia in smears. Antibody titers against Bredavirus, total serum protein and serum gamma globulin content were evaluated in the blood samples. Bredavirus was found in fecal samples from 5% (n = 6) of diarrheic calves which came from four different herds, but not in healthy calves. Rotavirus (31.9%), coronavirus (18.5%) and cryptosporidia (29.9%) were detected more frequently in fecal samples than Bredavirus. In this investigation rotavirus, coronavirus and cryptosporidia were present in addition in all herds where Bredavirus was found. In contrast to the low percentage of fecal samples containing Bredavirus, antibody titers in 75% of calves confirmed the high prevalence of Bredavirus infection in the cattle population of Lower Saxony.","Liebler, E M; Klüver, S; Pohlenz, J; Koopmans, M",DTW.

METHODS Fast peripheral venous blood samples were collected from 61 post-SARS patients with osteonecrosis, 25 males and 36 females, aged 30.4 (20 - 60), and 52 sex and age-matched healthy persons as controls. ELISA was used to detect the coagulation and fibrinolysis indicators: activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), protein C (PC), antithrombin III (AT-III), plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI), activated protein C resistance (APC-R), plasminogen (PLG), von Willebrand factor (VWF), D-dimer (D-D), and fibrinogen (Fib). Real-time PCR was used to detect the mutation of factor V G1601A (FV Leiden) and prothrombin G20210A. RESULTS The levels of PC, AT-III, and PLG of the osteonecrosis group were 85% +/- 34%, 84 +/- 29%, and 69 +/- 23%, significantly lower than that of the control group (109% +/- 20%, 104% +/- 14%, and 94% +/- 15% respectively, all P < 0.01). PAI of the osteonecrosis group was 16 U/ml +/- 14 U/ml, significantly higher than that of the control group (8.0 U/ml +/- 4.3 U/ml, P < 0.01). The percentage of patients with abnormal indicators was 99.5% (54/61) in the osteonecrosis group, significantly higher than that of the control group (36.5%, 19/52, P < 0.01). The percentage of patients with 3 or more abnormal indicators was 72.1% (44/61) in the osteonecrosis group, significantly higher than that of the control group (17.3%, 9/52, P < 0.01). No mutations of F V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A was found in both groups. CONCLUSION Trends of hypercoagulation and hypofibrinolysis exist in the post-SARS patients with osteonecrosis. APTT, PC, AT-III, and PLG can be used as sensitive indicator for screening high risk populations of osteonecrosis.","Sun, Wei; Li, Zi-rong; Shi, Zhen-cai; Zhang, Nian-fei; Han, Cheng-wu; Cong, Xiao; Zhang, Yuan-chun",Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16677567/,168

The disease subsequently spread to 4 other healthcare institutions and a vegetable wholesale centre. During the period between March and May 2003, 238 probable SARS cases, including 8 imported cases and 33 deaths, were reported. Transmission within the healthcare and household settings accounted for more than 90% of the cases. Factors contributing to the spread of infection included the failure to recognise the high infectivity of this novel infection, resulting in a delay in isolating initial cases and contacts and the implementation of personal protective measures in healthcare institutions; and the super-spreading events by 5 index cases, including 3 with co-morbid conditions presenting with atypical clinical manifestations of SARS. Key public health measures were directed at prevention and control within the community and hospitals, and the prevention of imported and exported cases. An isolated laboratory-acquired case of SARS was reported on 8 September 2003. Based on the lessons learnt, Singapore has further strengthened its operational readiness and laboratory safety to respond to SARS, avian flu and other emerging diseases.","Goh, Kee-Tai; Cutter, Jeffery; Heng, Bee-Hoon; Ma, Stefan; Koh, Benjamin K W; Kwok, Cynthia; Toh, Cheong-Mui; Chew, Suok-Kai","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16829997/,168

193498,Reproductive toxicology. Acetaminophen.,1997,"INTRODUCTION Vaccine hesitancy is a rising public health threat, thwarting progress to reduce vaccine-preventable diseases. While drivers of racial disparities in childhood immunization rates (CIR) have been described, none have explored these disparities at UW Health, and few have highlighted the role of anti-vaccination (anti-vaxx) campaigns in the Black/African American (BAA) community. OBJECTIVES This quality improvement study evaluates childhood immunization data for racial and ethnic disparities, identifies possible drivers, and proposes equitable solutions. METHODS UW Health CIR were analyzed for racial and ethnic disparities between December 31, 2015, and December 31, 2019. A root cause analysis was done to explore potential drivers. An in-depth media review of targeted anti-vaxx campaigns was chosen for further exploration using ""anti-vaccine leaders targeting minority becomes growing concern at NYC forum"" as the initial search query template. Google Trend and literature searches were performed to understand questions BAA parents have about vaccines. RESULTS UW Health data show significant increasing racial and ethnic disparities in CIR. As of December 31, 2019, the immunization rates were 90.74% for White children, 88.11% for Asian children, and 68.29% for BAA children. Media review suggests anti-vaccination leaders have increasingly targeted the BAA community with vaccine misinformation and skepticism. Analysis of vaccine-related queries suggest 8 core questions BAA parents have about vaccines. CONCLUSIONS Health systems must assess their CIR for disparities and further dissect drivers to effect change. We focus on suggesting strategies to combat negative media campaigns, among others, to close the gap. Understanding of all factors is needed to develop effective interventions to reduce disparities in childhood immunization rates in the BAA community served by UW Health and beyond.","Nartey, Sharon-Rose; Temte, Jonathan; Petty, Elizabeth",WMJ : official publication of the State Medical Society of Wisconsin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33819400/,168

MATERIAL AND METHODS Prospective, observational CoSTuM (Spanish acronym for comorbidity, symptoms, treatments, and poor heart rate control) study of patients with AF. We recorded all adverse events occurring during follow-up and used multivariate logistic regression analysis to identify variables independently associated with the occurrence of any such event. A risk model was developed with data from a random sample of 66% of the patients. Data for the remaining patients were used for internal validation of the model. RESULTS We analyzed data for 645 patients (50.2% women; median [interquartile range] age, 76 (67-81 years). At 90 days, at least 1 adverse event had occurred in 165 patients (25.6%); 114 were in the development sample and 51 were in the validation sample. Independent variables associated with risk for adverse events were age 70 years or older; vascular disease; heart failure; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; kidney disease; obesity; poorly controlled AF symptoms (European Heart Rhythm Association score, III-IV); use of oxygen therapy, digoxin, or other antiarrhythmics in the ED; and poor control of heart rate. The CoSTuM scale based on these variables demonstrated optimal predictive value in both the development sample (c statistic, 0.901; 95% CI, 0.869-0.928; P .001) and the validation sample (c statistic, 0.850, 95% CI, 0.796-0.894; P .001). CONCLUSION The CoSTuM risk score was a good predictor of 90-day adverse events after ED discharge of patients treated for AF.","Adánez Martínez, María Gracia; Leal Costa, César; García López, José Antonio; Torres Ganfornina, Máximo; Ramos Morcillo, Antonio Jesús; Hernández Ruipérez, Tomás; García Palenciano, Carlos; Díaz Agea, José Luis",Emergencias : revista de la Sociedad Espanola de Medicina de Emergencias,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33750049/,168

In order to determine the amino acid sequences surrounding the p28 cleavage site, the first 4.6 kb of murine hepatitis virus strain A59 ORF1a was expressed in a cell-free transcription-translation system. Amino-terminal radiosequencing of the resulting downstream cleavage product demonstrated that cleavage occurs between Gly-247 and Val-248. Site-directed mutagenesis of amino acids surrounding the p28 cleavage site revealed that substitutions of Arg-246 (P2) and Gly-247 (P1) nearly eliminated cleavage of p28. Single-amino-acid substitutions of other residues between P7 and P2' were generally permissive for cleavage, although a few changes did greatly reduce proteolysis. The relationship between the p28 cleavage site and other viral and cellular papain proteinase cleavage sites is discussed.","Hughes, S A; Bonilla, P J; Weiss, S R",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7815547/,168

Specific-pathogen-free cats were inoculated with the avirulent FIPV-UCD-2 isolate or the extremely virulent FIPV-79-1146 isolate or both. After 1 month, cats which had received FIPV-79-1146 were either dead or showed clinical signs of FIP. All cats which received only FIPV-UCD-2 remained healthy up to 6 months after inoculation. Antibody-mediated immune enhancement of disease was not observed in cats which received FIPV-UCD-2 before inoculation with FIPV-79-1146. Monoclonal antibodies which recognized type-specific epitopes on each of the structural polypeptides of these two viruses were used in competitive-inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to analyze the humoral immune responses of the cats. All cats produced antibodies to epitopes found on the homologous virus. In addition, cats inoculated with FIPV-79-1146 also produced antibodies which inhibited the binding of the anti-FIPV-UCD-2 E1 monoclonal antibody. One cat inoculated twice with FIPV-UCD-2 produced antibodies which inhibited the binding of the anti-FIPV-79-1146 N- and E1-specific monoclonal antibodies.

We constructed truncated recombinant N proteins (N1 [1-422 aa], N2 [1- 109 aa], and N3 [110-422 aa]) and determined their antigenicity by Western blotting using convalescent SARS serum. The recombinants containing N1 and N3 reacted with convalescent SARS serum in Western blotting. However, the recombinant with N2 did not. In ELISA using N1 or N3 as the antigens, positive results were observed in 10 of 10 (100%) SARS-CoV-positive human sera. None of 50 healthy sera gave positive results in either assay. These data indicate that the ELISA using N1 or N3 has high sensitivity and specificity.

Recent studies have examined the performance of fabrics under various conditions; however, the performance against violent respiratory events such as human sneezes is yet to be explored. Accordingly, we present a comprehensive experimental study using sneezes by a healthy adult and a tailored image-based flow measurement diagnostic system evaluating all dimensions of protection of commonly available fabrics and their layered combinations: the respiratory droplet blocking efficiency, water resistance, and breathing resistance. Our results reveal that a well-designed cloth mask can outperform a three-layered surgical mask for such violent respiratory events. Specifically, increasing the number of layers significantly increases the droplet blocking efficiency, on average by â¼20 times per additional fabric layer. A minimum of three layers is necessary to resemble the droplet blocking performance of surgical masks, and a combination of cotton/linen (hydrophilic inner layer)-blends (middle layer)-polyester/nylon (hydrophobic outer layer) exhibited the best performance among overall indicators tested. In an optimum three-layered design, the average thread count should be greater than 200, and the porosity should be less than 2%. Furthermore, machine washing at 60 °C did not significantly impact the performance of cloth masks. These findings inform the design of high-performing homemade cloth masks.","Bhattacharjee, Shovon; Bahl, Prateek; de Silva, Charitha; Doolan, Con; Chughtai, Abrar Ahmad; Heslop, David; MacIntyre, Chandini Raina",ACS Biomater Sci Eng,,168

In this study, we examined the impact of the STING signaling pathway on coronavirus infection using the human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) model. We found that HCoV-OC43 infection did not stimulate the STING signaling pathway, but the activation of STING signaling effectively inhibits HCoV-OC43 infection to a much greater extent than that of type I interferons (IFNs). We also discovered that IRF3, the key STING downstream innate immune effector, is essential for this anticoronavirus activity. In addition, we found that the amidobenzimidazole (ABZI)-based human STING agonist diABZI robustly blocks the infection of not only HCoV-OC43 but also SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, our study identifies the STING signaling pathway as a potential therapeutic target that could be exploited for developing broad-spectrum antiviral therapeutics against multiple coronavirus strains in order to face the challenge of future coronavirus outbreaks.IMPORTANCE The highly infectious and lethal SARS-CoV-2 is posing an unprecedented threat to public health. Other coronaviruses are likely to jump from a nonhuman animal to humans in the future. Novel broad-spectrum antiviral therapeutics are therefore needed to control known pathogenic coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and its newly mutated variants, as well as future coronavirus outbreaks. STING signaling is a well-established host defense pathway, but its role in coronavirus infection remains unclear. In the present study, we found that activation of the STING signaling pathway robustly inhibits infection of HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV-2. These results identified the STING pathway as a novel target for controlling the spread of known pathogenic coronaviruses, as well as emerging coronavirus outbreaks.","Liu, Wei; Reyes, Hanako M; Yang, June F; Li, Yize; Stewart, Kathleen M; Basil, Maria C; Lin, Susan M; Katzen, Jeremy; Morrisey, Edward E; Weiss, Susan R; You, Jianxin",J. virol,,168

214350,Public health education post-COVID-19: a proposal for critical revisions,2021,"Background: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a growing pandemic with an increasing death toll that has been linked to various comorbidities as well as racial disparity. However, the specific characteristics of these at-risk populations are still not known and approaches to lower mortality are lacking. Methods: We conducted a retrospective electronic health record data analysis of 25,326 subjects tested for COVID-19 between 2/25/20 and 6/22/20 at the University of Alabama at Birmingham Hospital, a tertiary health care center in the racially diverse Southern U.S. The primary outcome was mortality in COVID-19-positive subjects and the association with subject characteristics and comorbidities was analyzed using simple and multiple linear logistic regression. Results: The odds ratio of contracting COVID-19 was disproportionately high in Blacks/African-Americans (OR 2.6; 95% CI 2.19-3.10; p<0.0001) and in subjects with obesity (OR 1.93; 95% CI 1.64-2.28; p<0.0001), hypertension (OR 2.46; 95% CI 2.07-2.93; p<0.0001), and diabetes (OR 2.11; 95% CI 1.78-2.48; p<0.0001). Diabetes was also associated with a dramatic increase in mortality (OR 3.62; 95% CI 2.11-6.2; p<0.0001) and emerged as an independent risk factor in this diverse population even after correcting for age, race, sex, obesity, and hypertension. Interestingly, we found that metformin treatment prior to diagnosis of COVID-19 was independently associated with a significant reduction in mortality in subjects with diabetes and COVID-19 (OR 0.33; 95% CI 0.13-0.84; p=0.0210). Conclusion: Thus, these results suggest that while diabetes is an independent risk factor for COVID-19-related mortality, this risk is dramatically reduced in subjects taking metformin prior to diagnosis of COVID-19, raising the possibility that metformin may provide a protective approach in this high risk population.","Crouse, Andrew B; Grimes, Tiffany; Li, Peng; Might, Matthew; Ovalle, Fernando; Shalev, Anath",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),,168

215389,The role of uncertainty tolerance and meaning in life on depression and anxiety throughout Covid-19 pandemic,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Childhood cancers are a leading cause of non-communicable disease deaths for children around the world. The COVID-19 pandemic may have impacted on global children's cancer services, which can have consequences for childhood cancer outcomes. The Global Health Research Group on Children's Non-Communicable Diseases is currently undertaking the first international cohort study to determine the variation in paediatric cancer management during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the short-term to medium-term impacts on childhood cancer outcomes. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a multicentre, international cohort study that will use routinely collected hospital data in a deidentified and anonymised form. Patients will be recruited consecutively into the study, with a 12-month follow-up period. Patients will be included if they are below the age of 18 years and undergoing anticancer treatment for the following cancers: acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, Burkitt lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, Wilms tumour, sarcoma, retinoblastoma, gliomas, medulloblastomas and neuroblastomas. Patients must be newly presented or must be undergoing active anticancer treatment from 12 March 2020 to 12 December 2020. The primary objective of the study was to determine all-cause mortality rates of 30 days, 90 days and 12 months. This study will examine the factors that influenced these outcomes. &#967;2 analysis will be used to compare mortality between low-income and middle-income countries and high-income countries. Multilevel, multivariable logistic regression analysis will be undertaken to identify patient-level and hospital-level factors affecting outcomes with adjustment for confounding factors. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: At the host centre, this study was deemed to be exempt from ethical committee approval due to the use of anonymised registry data. At other centres, participating collaborators have gained local approvals in accordance with their institutional ethical regulations. Collaborators will be encouraged to present the results locally, nationally and internationally. The results will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.","Peter, Noel; Bandyopadhyay, Soham; Lakhoo, Kokila",BMJ Open,,168

The antiviral prodrug remdesivir is still the most widely used therapeutic during the early stage of the infection. However, the current synthetic routes rely on the use of protecting groups, air-sensitive reagents, and cryogenic conditions, impeding the cost-efficient supply to patients. We therefore focused on the development of a straightforward, direct addition of (hetero)arenes to unprotected sugars. Here we report a silylium-catalyzed and completely stereoselective C-glycosidation that initially yields the open-chain polyols, which can be selectively cyclized to provide either the kinetic alpha-furanose or the thermodynamically favored beta-anomer. The method significantly expedites the synthesis of remdesivir precursor GS-441524 after subsequent Mn-catalyzed C–H oxidation and deoxycyanation.","Carla, Obradors Benjamin Mitschke Miles H.

It is expected that the numbers will dramatically rise during the COVID-19 pandemic. Established medications are not sufficient to adequately treat depression and are not available for everyone. Plants from traditional medicine may be promising alternatives to treat depressive symptoms. The model organism Chaenorhabditis elegans was used to assess the stress reducing effects of methanol/dichlormethane extracts from plants used in traditional medicine. After initial screening for antioxidant activity, nine extracts were selected for in vivo testing in oxidative stress, heat stress, and osmotic stress assays. Additionally, anti-aging properties were evaluated in lifespan assay. The extracts from Acanthopanax senticosus, Campsis grandiflora, Centella asiatica, Corydalis yanhusuo, Dan Zhi, Houttuynia cordata, Psoralea corylifolia, Valeriana officinalis, and Withaniasomnifera showed antioxidant activity of more than 15 Trolox equivalents per mg extract. The extracts significantly lowered ROS in mutants, increased resistance to heat stress and osmotic stress, and the extended lifespan of the nematodes. The plant extracts tested showed promising results in increasing stress resistance in the nematode model. Further analyses are needed, in order to unravel underlying mechanisms and transfer results to humans.","Naß, Janine; Kampf, Christopher J; Efferth, Thomas",Molecules (Basel),,168
218654,Awareness and answers for the public health concern of violence in older adults: An introduction to special issue,2020,"In honeybees there are three alleles of cytosolic malate dehydrogenase: F, M and S. Allele frequencies are correlated with environmental temperature, suggesting that the alleles have temperature-dependent fitness benefits. We determined the enzymic activity of each allele across a range of temperatures in vitro The F and S alleles have higher activity and are less sensitive to high temperatures than the M allele, which loses activity after incubation at temperatures found in the thorax of foraging bees in hot climates. Next, we predicted the protein structure of each allele and used molecular dynamics simulations to investigate their molecular flexibility. The M allele is more flexible than the S and F alleles at 50°C, suggesting a plausible explanation for M's loss of activity at high temperatures, and has the greatest structural flexibility at 15°C, suggesting that it can retain some enzyme activity at cooler temperatures. MM bees recovered from two hours of cold narcosis significantly better than all other genotypes. Combined, these results explain clinal variation in MDH allele frequencies in the honeybee at the molecular level.","Meemongkolkiat, Thitipan; Allison, Jane; Seebacher, Frank; Lim, Julianne; Chanchao, Chanpen; Oldroyd, Benjamin P",J. exp. biol,,168

221670,"Democracy, Capacity, and Coercion in Pandemic Response: COVID-19 in Comparative Political Perspective",2020,"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) targets multiple organs and causes severe coagulopathy. Histopathological organ changes might not only be attributable to a direct virus-induced effect, but also the immune response. The aims of this study were to assess the duration of viral presence, identify the extent of inflammatory response, and investigate the underlying cause of coagulopathy. Methods: This prospective autopsy cohort study was done at Amsterdam University Medical Centers (UMC), the Netherlands. With informed consent from relatives, full body autopsy was done on 21 patients with COVID-19 for whom autopsy was requested between March 9 and May 18, 2020. In addition to histopathological evaluation of organ damage, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and the composition of the immune infiltrate and thrombi were assessed, and all were linked to disease course. Findings: Our cohort (n=21) included 16 (76%) men, and median age was 68 years (range 41-78). Median disease course (time from onset of symptoms to death) was 22 days (range 5-44 days). In 11 patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 tropism, SARS-CoV-2 infected cells were present in multiple organs, most abundantly in the lungs, but presence in the lungs became sporadic with increased disease course. Other SARS-CoV-2-positive organs included the upper respiratory tract, heart, kidneys, and gastrointestinal tract. In histological analyses of organs (sampled from nine to 21 patients per organ), an extensive inflammatory response was present in the lungs, heart, liver, kidneys, and brain. In the brain, extensive inflammation was seen in the olfactory bulbs and medulla oblongata. Thrombi and neutrophilic plugs were present in the lungs, heart, kidneys, liver, spleen, and brain and were most frequently observed late in the disease course (15 patients with thrombi, median disease course 22 days [5-44]; ten patients with neutrophilic plugs, 21 days [5-44]). Neutrophilic plugs were observed in two forms: solely composed of neutrophils with neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), or as aggregates of NETs and platelets.. Interpretation: In patients with lethal COVID-19, an extensive systemic inflammatory response was present, with a continued presence of neutrophils and NETs. However, SARS-CoV-2-infected cells were only sporadically present at late stages of COVID-19. This suggests a maladaptive immune response and substantiates the evidence for immunomodulation as a target in the treatment of severe COVID-19.

221931,625 The Impact of COVID-19 on Burn Care at a Regional Burn Center,2021,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Community mitigation strategies could help reduce COVID-19 incidence, but there are few studies that explore associations nationally and by urbanicity. In a national county-level analysis, we examined the probability of being identified as a county with rapidly increasing COVID-19 incidence (rapid riser identification) during the summer of 2020 by implementation of mitigation policies prior to the summer, overall and by urbanicity. METHODS: We analyzed county-level data on rapid riser identification during June 1-September 30, 2020 and statewide closures and statewide mask mandates starting March 19 (obtained from state government websites). Poisson regression models with robust standard error estimation were used to examine differences in the probability of rapid riser identification by implementation of mitigation policies (P-value< .05); associations were adjusted for county population size. RESULTS: Counties in states that closed for 0-59 days were more likely to become a rapid riser county than those that closed for >59 days, particularly in nonmetropolitan areas. The probability of becoming a rapid riser county was 43% lower among counties that had statewide mask mandates at reopening (adjusted prevalence ratio = 0.57; 95% confidence intervals = 0.51-0.63); when stratified by urbanicity, associations were more pronounced in nonmetropolitan areas. CONCLUSIONS: These results underscore the potential value of community mitigation strategies in limiting the COVID-19 spread, especially in nonmetropolitan areas.","Dasgupta, Sharoda; Kassem, Ahmed M; Sunshine, Gregory; Liu, Tiebin; Rose, Charles; Kang, Gloria J; Silver, Rachel; Maddox, Brandy L Peterson; Watson, Christina; Howard-Williams, Mara; Gakh, Maxim; McCord, Russell; Weber, Regen; Fletcher, Kelly; Musial, Trieste; Tynan, Michael A; Hulkower, Rachel; Moreland, Amanda; Pepin, Dawn; Landsman, Lisa; Brown, Amanda; Gilchrist, Siobhan; Clodfelter, Catherine; Williams, Michael; Cramer, Ryan; Limeres, Alexa; Popoola, Adebola; Dugmeoglu, Sebnem; Shelburne, Julia; Jeong, Gi; Rao, Carol Y",Ann Epidemiol,,168

In this paper, we study the impact of weekly testing protocols on college campuses. MethodsAn extended susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) compartmental model was used to simulate COVID-19 spread on a college campus setting. Seven scenarios were evaluated which considered polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and rapid antigen testing kits available at various levels of supply. The infection attack rate (IAR), the number of infections, and the number of tests utilized by the end of the simulation semester are reported and compared. ResultsWeekly testing significantly reduces the number of infections compared to when testing is not available. The use of PCR tests results in the lowest infection attack rate and the total number of cases; however, using rapid antigen tests with higher coverage is more effective than using PCR tests with lower coverage. ConclusionsThe implementation of COVID-19 testing protocols should be considered and evaluated as using testing allows for identification and isolation of cases which reduces the spread of COVID-19 on college campuses. Even if testing capacity is limited, its partial implementation can be beneficial.","Yu, Zhuoting; Fujimoto, Akane B.; Keskinocak, Pinar; Swann, Julie L",,,168

Cost and time efficient approaches to reduce the burthen of the disease are needed. To find potential COVID-19 treatments among the whole arsenal of existing drugs, we combined system biology and artificial intelligence-based approaches. The drug combination of pirfenidone and melatonin has been identified as a candidate treatment that may contribute to reduce the virus infection. Starting from different drug targets the effect of the drugs converges on human proteins with a known role in SARS-CoV-2 infection cycle. Simultaneously, GUILDify v2.0 web server has been used as an alternative method to corroborate the effect of pirfenidone and melatonin against the infection of SARS-CoV-2. We have also predicted a potential therapeutic effect of the drug combination over the respiratory associated pathology, thus tackling at the same time two important issues in COVID-19. These evidences, together with the fact that from a medical point of view both drugs are considered safe and can be combined with the current standard of care treatments for COVID-19 makes this combination very attractive for treating patients at stage II, non-severe symptomatic patients with the presence of virus and those patients who are at risk of developing severe pulmonary complications.","Artigas, Laura; Coma, Mireia; Matos-Filipe, Pedro; Aguirre-Plans, Joaquim; Farrés, Judith; Valls, Raquel; Fernandez-Fuentes, Narcis; de la Haba-Rodriguez, Juan; Olvera, Alex; Barbera, Jose; Morales, Rafael; Oliva, Baldo; Mas, Jose Manuel",PLoS One,,168

232532,Re-thinking global and public health projects during the COVID-19 pandemic context: considerations and recommendations for early- and not-so-early- career researchers,2020,"The aim of this clinical trial was to control the cytokine storm by administering mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to critically-ill COVID-19 patients, to evaluate the healing effect, and to systematically investigate how the treatment works. Patients with moderate and critical COVID-19 clinical manifestations were separated as Group 1 (moderate cases, n = 10, treated conventionally), Group 2 (critical cases, n = 10, treated conventionally), and Group 3 (critical cases, n = 10, treated conventionally plus MSCs transplantation therapy of three consecutive doses on treatment days 0, 3, and 6, (as 3 × 106 cells/kg, intravenously). The treatment mechanism of action was investigated with evaluation markers of the cytokine storm, via biochemical parameters, levels of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, analyses of tissue regeneration via the levels of growth factors, apoptosis markers, chemokines, matrix metalloproteinases, and granzyme-B, and by the assessment of the immunomodulatory effects via total oxidant/antioxidant status markers and the levels of lymphocyte subsets. In the assessment of the overall mortality rates of all the cases, six patients in Group-2 and three patients in Group-3 died, and there was no loss in Group-1. Proinflammatory cytokines IFNÎ³, IL-6, IL-17A, IL-2, IL-12, anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10, IL-13, IL-1ra, and growth factors TGF-ß, VEGF, KGF, and NGF levels were found to be significant in Group-3. When Group-2 and Group-3 were compared, serum ferritin, fibrinogen and CRP levels in Group-3 had significantly decreased. CD45 +, CD3 +, CD4 +, CD8 +, CD19 +, HLA-DR +, and CD16 + / CD56 + levels were evaluated. In the statistical comparison of the groups, significance was only determined in respect of neutrophils. The results demonstrated the positive systematic and cellular effects of MSCs application on critically ill COVID-19 patients in a versatile way. This effect plays an important role in curing and reducing mortality in critically ill patients.","Adas, G; Cukurova, Z; Yasar, K Kart; Yilmaz, R; Isiksacan, N; Kasapoglu, P; Yesilbag, Z; Koyuncu, I D; Karaoz, E",Cell Transplant,,168
233369,Explaining system-level change in welfare governance: the role of policy indeterminacy and concatenations of social mechanisms,2020,"The main objective of diabetes control is to correct hyperglycaemia while avoiding hypoglycaemia, especially in insulin-treated patients. Fear of hypoglycaemia is a hurdle to effective correction of hyperglycaemia because it promotes under-dosing of insulin. Strategies to minimise hypoglycaemia include education and training for improved hypoglycaemia awareness and the development of technologies to allow their early detection and thus minimise their occurrence. Patients with impaired hypoglycaemia awareness would benefit the most from these technologies. The purpose of this systematic review is to review currently available or in-development technologies that support detection of hypoglycaemia or hypoglycaemia risk, and identify gaps in the research. Nanomaterial use in sensors is a promising strategy to increase the accuracy of continuous glucose monitoring devices for low glucose values. Hypoglycaemia is associated with changes on vital signs, so electrocardiogram and encephalogram could also be used to detect hypoglycaemia. Accuracy improvements through multivariable measures can make already marketed galvanic skin response devices a good noninvasive alternative. Breath volatile organic compounds can be detected by dogs and devices and alert patients at hypoglycaemia onset, while near-infrared spectroscopy can also be used as a hypoglycaemia alarms. Finally, one of the main directions of research are deep learning algorithms to analyse continuous glucose monitoring data and provide earlier and more accurate prediction of hypoglycaemia. Current developments for early identification of hypoglycaemia risk combine improvements of available 'needle-type' enzymatic glucose sensors and noninvasive alternatives. Patient usability will be essential to demonstrate to allow their implementation for daily use in diabetes management.","Diouri, Omar; Cigler, Monika; Vettoretti, Martina; Mader, Julia K; Choudhary, Pratik; Renard, Eric",Diabetes Metab Res Rev,,168

Participants: In May 2020, 403 undergraduates (74% women; Mage = 20.4; 65% White, 19% Asian, 10% Latinx, 6% Black) were recruited. Methods: Participants completed a survey 2 months after their university switched to remote instruction due to COVID-19. Results: 15.2% reported either COVID-19 diagnosis or perceived symptoms, but there were no racial/ethnic disparities in this health outcome. Latinx and Asian students experienced higher COVID-19 related threat and negative beliefs than White students. Asian students experienced more discrimination and Latinx students experienced greater economic impacts. There were no differences in mental health or health behaviors. Conclusion: Results suggest that psychosocial impacts of a pandemic on undergraduate students vary by race/ethnicity, although mental health responses may be more universal. Implications for how colleges and universities can best serve student needs are discussed.","Trammell PhD, Janet P; Joseph PhD, Nataria T; Harriger PhD, Jennifer A",J Am Coll Health,,168

METHOD: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the Wellington Hospital ICU database and included patients with an unplanned ICU admission during the first 35 weeks of the year from 2015 to 2020 inclusive. The primary variable of interest was the rate of unplanned ICU admission in 2020 compared with historical controls. We also described the characteristics and outcomes of patients with unplanned admissions to ICU during the 2020 COVID-19 lockdown compared to historical controls. RESULTS: During the five weeks of Alert Level Four, and the subsequent two weeks of Alert Level Three, the number of unplanned ICU admissions per day fell to 1.65±1.52 compared to a historical average of 2.56±1.52 ICU unplanned ICU admissions per day (P<0.0001). The observed reduction in ICU admission rates appeared to occur for most categories of ICU admission diagnosis but was not evident for patients with neurologic disorders. The characteristics and outcomes of patients who had unplanned admissions to Wellington ICU during the COVID-19 lockdown were broadly similar to historical controls. The rate of unplanned ICU admissions in 2020 before and after the lockdown period were similar to historical controls. CONCLUSION: In this study, we observed a reduction in unplanned admissions to Wellington Hospital ICU associated with New Zealand's initial COVID-19 lockdown.","Young, Paul J; Gladwin, Benjamin; Psirides, Alex; Reid, Alice",N Z Med J,,168

240021,Survival Analysis of COVID-19 Patients in Russia Using Machine Learning,2020,"High-throughput technologies such as next generation sequencing allow biologists to observe cell function with unprecedented resolution, but the resulting datasets are too large and complicated for humans to understand without the aid of advanced statistical methods. Machine learning (ML) algorithms, which are designed to automatically find patterns in data, are well suited to this task. Yet these models are often so complex as to be opaque, leaving researchers with few clues about underlying mechanisms. Interpretable machine learning (iML) is a burgeoning subdiscipline of computational statistics devoted to making the predictions of ML models more intelligible to end users. This article is a gentle and critical introduction to iML, with an emphasis on genomic applications. I define relevant concepts, motivate leading methodologies, and provide a simple typology of existing approaches. I survey recent examples of iML in genomics, demonstrating how such techniques are increasingly integrated into research workflows. I argue that iML solutions are required to realize the promise of precision medicine. However, several open challenges remain. I examine the limitations of current state of the art tools and propose a number of directions for future research. While the horizon for iML in genomics is wide and bright, continued progress requires close collaboration across disciplines.","Watson, David S.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.03063v1.pdf,168

In the current study, we aimed to assess the effects of the perceived importance of safety measures at the Sharm El Sheikh airport on the intention of international passengers to revisit the destination, which might reflect their behavioral control for traveling to other tourism destinations. A total of 954 international travelers were asked to fill out a survey to reveal their travel risk perceptions, the importance of airport safety measures, and their future intentions to revisit the destination, and the data were integrated in an SEM model. The results showed that passengers with low-risk perceptions and highly perceived importance of logistic and sanitization procedures, as well as traveler- and staff-related safety measures, were more likely to exhibit greater intentions to revisit the city and lower intentions to cancel or change future travel plans to other touristic regions. Health safety at airports should be stressed in future strategic plans by governmental authorities and stakeholder activities to mitigate the psychological barriers of tourists.","Hassan, Thowayeb H.; Salem, Amany E.",Sustainability,,168

As of 6 March, 90 cases were diagnosed in Hokkaido. Unfortunately, many infected persons may not have been recognized due to having mild or no symptoms during the initial months of the outbreak. We therefore aimed to predict the actual number of COVID-19 cases in (i) Hokkaido Prefecture and (ii) Sapporo city using data on cases diagnosed outside these areas. Two statistical frameworks involving a balance equation and an extrapolated linear regression model with a negative binomial link were used for deriving both estimates, respectively. The estimated cumulative incidence in Hokkaido as of 27 February was 2,297 cases (95% confidence interval (CI): 382-7091) based on data on travelers outbound from Hokkaido. The cumulative incidence in Sapporo city as of 28 February was estimated at 2233 cases (95% CI: 0-4893) based on the count of confirmed cases within Hokkaido. Both approaches resulted in similar estimates, indicating a higher incidence of infections in Hokkaido than were detected by the surveillance system. This quantification of the gap between detected and estimated cases helped to inform the public health response at the beginning of the pandemic and provided insight into the possible scope of undetected transmission for future assessments.","Akhmetzhanov, A.

Our findings suggest that a knowledge gap exists, with those with higher education levels displaying higher levels of knowledge. In contrast, education level did not play a role in believing false information. Moreover, higher news consumption through radio, print newspapers and magazines, and especially social media was associated with lower levels of knowledge and more fake news beliefs. However, news media consumption did not moderate the relationship between education and either knowledge or fake news beliefs, meaning that the media did not explain the education-based knowledge gap during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Gerosa, T.; Gui, M.; Hargittai, E.; Nguyen, M.

METHODS: a descriptive, cross-sectional study in a sample of 116 Spanish schoolchildren. The perception of loneliness, happiness, and health was assessed using three items of the Health Behavior in School-aged Children questionnaire. The quality of their Mediterranean diet was assessed using the Mediterranean Diet Quality Index quetsionnaire for children and adolescents. Anthropometric variables were collected through a self-reported questionnaire, and for the calculation of body mass index the Quetelet index (kg/m2) was used. RESULTS: the descriptive analysis showed no differences in the perception of loneliness, happiness, or health, quality of diet, or anthropometric variables (p > 0.005), except for weight (p < 0.005), according to sex. The inferential analysis showed that higher values in quality of diet are correlated with higher scores in perceived happiness and health (p < 0.005). In turn, the linear regression test showed an association between quality of diet and perception of happiness after the model was adjusted for normal weight (R2 = 0.382; p < 0.005). Likewise, it showed a significant association between quality of diet and perception of health after the model was adjusted for overweight schoolchildren (R2 = 0.455; p < 0.005). CONCLUSION: the association between perceived health and happiness with quality of diet seems to be moderated by weight status.","Carrillo Lopez, Pedro José; Rosa Guillamón, Andrés; Tárraga López, Pedro Juan; García Cantó, Eliseo",Nutr. hosp,,168

258775,Did You Know?,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To study the association of endometrial thickness (EMT) with live birth rates (LBR) in ovarian stimulation with intrauterine insemination (OS-IUI) treatments for unexplained infertility. DESIGN: Prospective cohort analysis of the Reproductive Medicine Network's Assessment of Multiple Intrauterine Gestations from Ovarian Stimulation (AMIGOS) randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Multicenter randomized controlled trial. PATIENTS: A total of 868 couples with unexplained infertility (n=2,459 cycles). INTERVENTIONS: OS-IUI treatment cycles (n = 2,459) as part of the AMIGOS clinical trial. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Live birth rates; unadjusted and adjusted risk ratios (RR) for live birth by EMT category, calculated using generalized estimating equations. RESULTS: The overall mean EMT on day of human chorionic gonadotropin administration in cycles with a live birth was significantly greater than in those without. Compared to the referent EMT group of 9 to 12 mm, the unadjusted RR for live birth for the EMT groups of &#8804;5 and 6-8 were 0.48 and 0.92, respectively. The test for trend indicated evidence of decreasing LBR with decreasing EMT. After adjustment for ovarian stimulation medication, a linear trend was no longer supported. Stratified analyses revealed no differences in associations by treatment group. CONCLUSIONS: In OS-IUI for unexplained infertility, higher LBR are observed with increasing EMT; however, EMT is not significantly associated with LBR when adjusted for OS treatment type. Appreciable LBR are seen at all EMT, even those of &#8804;5 mm, suggesting that OS-IUI cycles should not be canceled for thin endometrium.

We aimed to determine factors predicting poor outcomes in hospitalized diabetic patients with COVID-19. Methods: This retrospective cohort study included all adult diabetic patients with radiological or laboratory confirmed COVID-19 who hospitalized between 20 February 2020 and 27 April 2020 in Alborz province, Iran. Data on demographic, medical history, and laboratory test at presentation were obtained from electronic medical records. Diagnosis of diabetes mellitus was self-reported. Comorbidities including cancer, rheumatism, immunodeficiency, or chronic diseases of respiratory, liver, and blood were classified as ""other comorbidities"" due to low frequency. The assessed poor outcomes were in-hospital mortality, need to ICU care, and receiving invasive mechanical ventilation. Self-reported. Multivariate logistic regression models were fitted to quantify the predictors of in-hospital mortality from COVID-19 in patients with DM. Results: Of 455 included patients, 98(21.5%) received ICU care, 65(14.3%) required invasive mechanical ventilation, and 79 (17.4%) dead. In the multivariate model, significant predictors of ""death of COVID-19"" were age 65 years or older (OR (95% CI): 2.0 (1.16-3.44), chronic kidney disease (CKD) (2.05 (1.16-3.62), presence of ""other comorbidities"" (2.20 (1.04-4.63)), neutrophil count &#8805;8.0 × 109/L)6.62 (3.73-11.7 ((, Hb level < 12.5 g/dl (2.05 (1.13-3.72) (, and creatinine level &#8805; 1.36 mg/dl (3.10 (1.38-6.98)).

262455,Serious games for serious crises: reflections from an infectious disease outbreak matrix game,2020,"BACKGROUND: in the current pandemic emergency, increased attention has given to treating symptoms that cause suffering in patients with COVID-19. This study aims to describe the role of palliative care in the management of these patients. METHODS: palliative consultation was requested by the staff as per protocol. In brief, the criteria for referring patients to a palliative care physician or to undergo palliative care were left to the discretion of the physician in charge. We recorded data regarding age, gender, length of stay, type of discharge (dead or alive, and transfer to long-term or hospice facilities). RESULTS: Between March 18 to May 8, 2020, 412 patients with COVID-19 were admitted to the Internal Medicine wards of Magenta Hospital, Italy. The palliative care physician was directly involved in 105 cases (25.5%) and performed 236 consultations. Of the 105 patients who received palliative care counselling, 66 (63%) died. The average number of days in care was 2.26 days. The principal reason for counseling was controlling symptoms (54%) and 12% deal with the end of life management. The prevalent symptom, among those which led to the counseling, was restlessness/agitation (41%), followed by emotional issues (26%) such as anxiety, fear, and demoralization. In only 20% of cases, dyspnoea was the reason for symptomatic treatment. CONCLUSIONS: A large number of hospitalized Covid-19 patients are at high risk of clinical deterioration and death. This leads to the opportunity to integrate a palliative physician into the staff, who treat these patients. There is an urgent need for protocol standardization and formal trials to verify the effectiveness of this approach.","Mumoli, Nicola; Florian, Clarissa; Cei, Marco; Evangelista, Isabella; Colombo, Alessandra; Razionale, Giancarlo; Moroni, Luca; Mazzone, Antonino",Int J Infect Dis,,168

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe patient characteristics associated with successful transition from in-person to virtual care, and video vs audio-only participation. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of electronic health record data from all patients with ambulatory visits from 1 October 2019-30 September 2020 in a large integrated health system in the Northeast USA. The outcome of interest was receipt of virtual care, and video vs audio-only participation. We matched home addresses with census-tract level area social vulnerability index (SVI) and Internet access. Among ambulatory care patients, we used logistic regression to identify characteristics associated with virtual participation. Among virtual participants, we identified characteristics associated with video vs audio-only visits. RESULTS: Among 1,241,313 patients, 528,542 (42.6%) were virtual participants. Relative to in-person only, virtual participants were older, more often English-proficient and with activated patient portal. Characteristics associated with virtual participation included patients with: only behavioural health visits, COVID patients, highest quartile of visit frequency, and multiple visit types. Characteristics associated with video participation (relative to audio-only) included being younger and patients with: only behavioural health visits, highest quartile of visit frequency, non-Hispanic black race, limited English proficiency and inactivated portal account. DISCUSSION: In our regional healthcare system, the transition to virtual care during COVID was vital for continued access to care, but substantial inequity remained. Without audio-only visits, access to care would have been even more limited for our most vulnerable patients.","Zachrison, Kori S; Yan, Zhiyu; Sequist, Thomas; Licurse, Adam; Tan-McGrory, Aswita; Erskine, Alistair; Schwamm, Lee H",J Telemed Telecare,,168

While currently available COVID-19 vaccinations are highly effective in immunocompetent individuals, they are often poorly immunogenic in CLL patients. It is important to understand the role heterologous boost would have in patients who did not respond to the recommended two-dose mRNA vaccine series with a SARS-CoV-2 specific immune response ObjectiveTo characterize the immune response of two CLL patients who failed to seroconvert after initial mRNA vaccine series following a third, heterologous, COVID-19 vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S. DesignTwo subjects with CLL were enrolled in an IRB-approved observational longitudinal cohort study of the immune response to COVID-19 vaccination. After enrollment, they received a third vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S. Blood was drawn prior to original vaccination series, four weeks after mRNA vaccination, and again four weeks after third vaccination. SettingEligible subjects were approached by oncologist overseeing CLL treatment and informed about study, at time of enrollment subjects consented to join the cohort study. ParticipantsSixteen subjects enrolled in the larger CLL cohort study, of whom two subjects received a third COVID-19 vaccination and were included in this analysis. Subject 1 is CLL treatment naive, while Subject 2 is currently on active treatment. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s)SARS-CoV-2 specific immune response, including plasma antibodies, memory B-cells, CD4 and CD8 T-cells were assessed prior to vaccination (baseline) as well as post vaccination series and post third dose. ResultsOf the two subjects who received Ad26.COV2.S doses, Subject 1 seroconverted, had RBD-specific memory B-cells as well as spike-specific CD4 T-cells while Subject 2 did not. Both subjects had a spike-specific CD8 T-cell response after original mRNA vaccination series that was further boosted after third dose (Subject 1), or remained stable (Subject 2). Conclusions and RelevanceThe results of this study, however small, is especially promising to CLL individuals who did not seroconvert following initial mRNA vaccination series. Especially those that are treatment naive, not currently in active treatment, or who may consider vaccination before beginning active treatment.","Lyski, Zoe L; Kim, Sunny; Lee, David Xthona; Sampson, David; Raue, Hans P; Raghunathan, Vikram; Ryan, Debbie; Brunton, Amanda E; Slifka, Mark K; Messer, William B; Spurgeon, Stephen E",,,168

ARBs directly protect the lung from the severe acute respiratory syndrome as a result of viral infections, including those from coronavirus. The protective effect of ACE2 is enhanced by ARB administration. For these reasons ARB therapy must be continued for patients affected by hypertension, diabetes and renal disease, comorbidities of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Controlled clinical studies should be conducted to determine whether ARBs may be included as additional therapy for COVID-19 patients.","Saavedra, Juan M",Pharmacol Res,,168

The study also explores external factors in terms of competitive intensity and internal factors in terms of financial and human resources possessed by firms that could enhance the impact of improvisational behavior on firm performance. Design/methodology/approach: A self-administered online questionnaire survey was used to collect the data from the random sample of 312 SMEs in Thailand. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data. Findings: The analysis supports the positive relationship between the improvisational behavior of entrepreneurs and firm performance. Moreover, the moderating effect analysis shows that the positive impact of improvisational behavior on firm performance tends to be stronger for firms that encountered a higher level of competitive intensity and for firms that possessed a higher level of financial and human resources.

We aim to report the clinical features of a child with axonal GBS associated with SARS-CoV-2. A 6-year-old male presented with symmetric ascending paralysis progressed over a 4-day course and 2 days of fever. He had bilateral lower and upper limb flaccid weakness of 1/5 with absent deep tendon reflexes. He had severe respiratory muscle weakness requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. On admission, SARS-CoV-2 returned as positive by real-time polymerase chain reaction on a nasopharyngeal swab. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed elevated protein without pleocytosis. He was diagnosed with GBS associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The nerve conduction study was suggestive of acute motor axonal neuropathy. Ten consecutive therapeutic plasma exchange sessions with 5% albumin replacement followed by four sessions on alternate days were performed. On Day 12, methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg/day for 5 days) was given. On Day 18, intravenous immunoglobulin (2 g/kg/day) was given and repeated 14 days after due to severe motor weakness. On Day 60, he was discharged from the hospital with weakness of neck flexor and extensor muscles of 3/5 and the upper limbs and the lower limbs of 2/5 on home-ventilation. Our patient is considered to be the youngest patient presenting with a possible para-infectious association between axonal GBS and SARS-CoV-2 infection. The disease course was severe with a rapid progression, an earlier peak, and prolonged duration in weakness as expected in axonal GBS.","Akçay, Nihal; Menentoglu, Mehmet Emin; Bektas, Gonca; Sevketoglu, Esra",J. med. virol,,168

274612,An eHealth Platform for the Holistic Management of COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: The novel human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is a major ongoing global threat with huge economic burden. Like all respiratory viruses, SARS-CoV-2 initiates infection in the upper respiratory tract (URT). Infected individuals are often asymptomatic, yet highly infectious and readily transmit virus. A therapy that restricts initial replication in the URT has the potential to prevent progression of severe lower respiratory tract disease as well as limiting person-to-person transmission. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 Victoria/01/2020 was passaged in Vero/hSLAM cells and virus titre determined by plaque assay. Challenge virus was delivered by intranasal instillation to female ferrets at 5.0 × 106 pfu/ml. Treatment groups received intranasal INNA-051, developed by Ena Respiratory. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected using the 2019-nCoV CDC RUO Kit and QuantStudio&#8482; 7 Flex Real-Time PCR System. Histopathological analysis was performed using cut tissues stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E). FINDINGS: We show that prophylactic intra-nasal administration of the TLR2/6 agonist INNA-051 in a SARS-CoV-2 ferret infection model effectively reduces levels of viral RNA in the nose and throat. After 5 days post-exposure to SARS-CoV-2, INNA-051 significantly reduced virus in throat swabs (p=<0.0001) by up to a 24 fold (96% reduction) and in nasal wash (p=0.0107) up to a 15 fold (93% reduction) in comparison to untreated animals. INTERPRETATION: The results of our study support clinical development of a therapy based on prophylactic TLR2/6 innate immune activation in the URT, to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission and provide protection against COVID-19.

282627,"General practice, COVID-19 and living with uncertainty",2020,"This study describes an outbreak of avian poxvirus disease in previously pox-vaccinated turkeys in Brazil. The turkeys had suggestive gross lesions of cutaneous avian poxvirus in the skin of the head and cervical area without changes in the flock mortality rates. In the slaughterhouse, 30 carcasses were removed from the slaughter line to collect tissue from cutaneous lesions for histological analyses and characterization of the virus. The virus was identified by conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and subsequent gene sequencing. Acanthosis, hyperkeratosis, and hydropic degeneration were seen on skin histopathology. Eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies (Bollinger) on keratinocytes were observed in 46.6% of the samples. Avian poxvirus DNA was detected on PCR in 83.3% of the total samples. PCR associated with histopathology had 93.3% of positivity for avian poxvirus. In the phylogenetic study, samples show 100% matching suggesting that the outbreak occurred by a single viral strain and was different from those strains affecting other wild birds such as canaries and sparrows. A single mutation (Adenine for Guanine) was detected in our study's strain and in the strains of turkey, chickens, and vaccine strains published in GenBank. Also, when the sequence strain of the present study and sequences from GenBank of canarypox and sparrowpox strains were aligned, a Thymine was found replacing the Adenine or Guanine. The in ovo vaccination method as single-use in turkeys of this study apparently did not provide adequate protection against avianpox disease, but additional vaccination administered by wing-web when turkeys were 45-60 days old in the new flocks controlled the disease. In the subsequent year, new cases of this disease were not found. It was not possible to confirm the source of the virus strain, but infection with a field strain derived from chickens is one possibility...(AU)","Ferreira, Bruna C; Ecco, Roselene; Couto, Rodrigo M; Coelho, Humberto E; Rossi, Daise A; Beletti, Marcelo E; Silva, Paulo L",Pesqui. vet. bras,,168

283889,"Towards healthy urbanism: inclusive, equitable and sustainable (THRIVES) – an urban design and planning framework from theory to praxis",2020,"INTRODUCTION: Following the nationwide lockdown in India, most hospitals shut down elective surgeries including cancer surgeries. We continued operating on patients with cancer at a tertiary referral center in Western India, which also served as a COVID care center. We also constructed a questionnaire, exclusive to surgeons, to determine the changes in treatment strategies as well as the response to the pandemic. METHODS: The complications of all cases operated in the study period (March 22, 2020-June 30, 2020) were graded using the Clavien-Dindo classification. Also, an anonymous structured questionnaire was constructed and e-mailed to all surgical oncologists working at our institute. RESULTS: Of the 118 patients having an operation, 18 had complications. There were 12 Grade I/II and 6 Grade III complications but none of our patients had Grade-IV/V complications. When the staff of the main operating theater tested COVID positive, the complex was shut down. However surgical oncology work continued at an affiliated institute about 10 km away from the main hospital. CONCLUSION: We had favorable outcomes while operating on cancer patients in a COVID care center. The results of our questionnaire proved that surgeons were willing to risk their personal safety to provide surgical oncology care.","Gautam, Pratik; Gandhi, Vidhyachandra; Naik, Shailesh; Mane, Anupama; Kanitkar, Gajanan; Hegde, Sujai; Deshmukh, Sanjay",J. surg. oncol,,168
285036,What information can I share with my patients about nutrition during COVID-19?,2020,"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19, a worldwide pandemic, has enforced a national lockdown in the UK which produced a paradigm shift about the way medical practitioners would perform consultations and communication with their patients. Senior authors realised that in lockdown there was only one option to see a patient: virtual consultation via telecommunication technologies. This paper will discuss the current benefits and considerations of Telemedicine, particularly in plastic surgery, to decipher the next route of action to further validate its use for future implementation. METHOD: A detailed literature review was carried out comparing papers from 1992 to 2020. A survey of 122 consultant plastic surgeons found an encouraging result as 70% positively embraced the suggestion of Telemedicine in their current practice. DISCUSSION: Telemedicine produced equal or improved patient satisfaction. Its utilisation reduced cost for patient, clinic and consultant. With accessibility to a large percentage of the population, Telemedicine enables infection control and adherence to social distancing during COVID-19. Considerations include dependability on internet access, legal aspects, cyber security and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the inability to perform palpation or physical inspection and psychological impacts on the patient. CONCLUSION: In modern times, Telemedicine has become more accessible and COVID-19 has made it more applicable than ever before. More in-depth research is needed for validation of this technique within plastic surgery. While maintaining quality of care and a vital role in social distancing, there is a strong need for standardisation of Telemedicine processes, platforms, encryption and data storage.

This qualitative study explored healthcare professionals' perceptions of teledermatology used for linking public primary care clinics with the specialist dermatology centre in Singapore. Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with 25 family physicians and dermatologists. Six themes were identified: satisfaction with the service; perceived patient benefits; rationale for introducing teledermatology; educational impact; challenges of virtual consultations; and desirable service refinements for the future. Family physicians and dermatologists were positive about the service, but highlighted a need to streamline referral processes and improve the quality of transmitted images. Reduced need for referral to the specialist centre could be achieved by expanding the polyclinic's pharmacopoeia and treatment modalities. This study highlights the benefits of telemedicine for patient, professionals, and healthcare organizations, and these are reassuring given the widespread and rapid introduction of telemedicine through necessity during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Chow, Aloysius; Teo, Sok Huang; Kong, Jing Wen; Lee, Simon Biing Ming; Heng, Yee Kiat; van Steensel, Maurice A M; Smith, Helen E",Acta derm. venereol,,168
288158,Health Data Privacy in the COVID-19 Pandemic Context: Discourses on HIPAA,2021,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Diagnosis of sleep apnoea was performed in sleep laboratories with polysomnography. This requires a room with supervision and presence of technologists and trained sleep experts. Today, clinical guidelines in most countries recommend home sleep apnoea testing with simple systems using six signals only. If criteria for signal quality, recording conditions, and patient selection are considered, then this is a reliable test with high accuracy. RECENT FINDINGS: Recently diagnostic tools for sleep apnoea diagnosis become even more simple: smartwatches and wearables with smart apps claim to diagnose sleep apnoea when these devices are tracking sleep and sleep quality as part of new consumer health checking. Alternative and new devices range from excellent diagnostic tools with high accuracy and full validation studies down to very low-quality tools which only result in random diagnostic reports. Due to the high prevalence of sleep apnoea, even a random diagnosis may match a real disorder sometimes. SUMMARY: Until now, there are no metrics established how to evaluate these alternative algorithms and simple devices. Proposals for evaluating smartwatches, smartphones, single-use sensors, and new algorithms are presented. New assessments may help to overcome current limitations in sleep apnoea severity metrics.

288961,Treating a Global Health Crisis with a Dose of Synthetic Chemistry,2020,"BACKGROUND: Tocilizumab, an inhibitor of the interleukin-6 receptor, may decrease the inflammatory response and control the symptoms of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but the evidence is scarce. METHODS: This retrospective study included patients with severe COVID-19 requiring oxygen therapy who received tocilizumab in seven centers across Poland. We assessed on-treatment changes in clinical status and inflammatory markers. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients were included (19 male), with a mean age of 61.7 ± 12.4 years. The mean time from symptom onset to the first tocilizumab dose was 10.5 ± 5.7 days. Clinical status improved within 24 hours in 11 (39%) patients, within one week in 23 (82%) patients, and within two weeks in 25 (89%); one (4%) patient showed no change and two (7%) patients died. Sixteen patients (57%) no longer needed oxygen therapy within a week (p < 0.001). The serum concentrations of C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and fibrinogen decreased significantly (p &#8804; 0.001). Lung changes improved in 21 (84%) patients within two weeks of treatment; 19 had minimal or no changes upon final examination. CONCLUSIONS: Tocilizumab can control the symptoms of severe COVID-19 by reducing the inflammatory response and rapidly improves the clinical status in most patients.","Tomasiewicz, Krzysztof; Piekarska, Anna; Stempkowska-Rejek, Justyna; Serafinska, Sylwia; Gawkowska, Aleksandra; Parczewski, Milosz; Niscigorska-Olsen, Jolanta; Lapinski, Tadeusz W; Zarebska-Michaluk, Dorota; Kowalska, Justyna D; Horban, Andrzej; Flisiak, Robert",Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther,,168

294848,Safety model for chest drainage in pandemic by COVID-19,2020,"AIM: Evaluation of the usefulness and the parental opinion about teleconsultation (TC) for rare pediatric epilepsies. METHOD: One-month prospective survey of consecutive TCs. All clinics on site have been turned into TC in the context of COVID-19 pandemic. The physicians quoted all TCs while the parents expressed their opinion though an invitation for an online questionnaire. RESULTS: We included 151 TCs (145 patients) among the 259 epilepsy TCs done during the study period. The parental questionnaire has been answered 105 times. The physicians felt confident to organize a TC for the next visit of 74.8% of the children, but some limits were identified such as the absence of physical examination, weight, and psychomotor development evaluation. The physicians felt more confident for a new TC in older patients (9.5â¯±â¯5.5â¯years versus 5.3â¯±â¯4.3â¯years) and in stable patients (73.8% confident for instable, 82.8% for stable). Parents were satisfied with TC feeling that it answered health issues in a better manner than a clinic pinpointing the gain of time and the absence of travel. However, half of them would prefer a clinic for the next appointment. INTERPRETATION: Teleconsultation seems useful answering the patients' needs according to both physicians and families. Despite some limitations, it is most likely that TCs become a new part of the clinical activities in rare pediatric epilepsy centers.","Dozières-Puyravel, Blandine; Auvin, Stéphane",Epilepsy Behav,,168
296355,Alleviation of Refugee Crisis in Lebanon through Humanitarian Aid Projects of Slovak Development Organizations in the Era of Covid-19 Pandemic,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic negatively impacted global healthcare. Consequences in Pediatric and Congenital Heart Surgery programmes and mortality of congenital heart patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-Cov-2) is still to be determined. OBJECTIVE: To study the COVID-19 pandemic implications in Brazilian Pediatric and Congenital Heart Surgery programmes. METHODS: We conducted a national online survey covering all states that perform Pediatric and Congenital Heart Surgery from 10 November to 22 November, 2020, using a Google forms questionnaire. We formulated questions related to impact on surgical volume, case-mix, and mortality. Then we asked about short-term post-operative COVID-19 infection and outcomes. RESULTS: We received responses from 46 centres representing all states where there were a Pediatric and Congenital Heart Surgery programme and all high-volume centres across the country. All but one centre experienced a significant decrease in surgical volume, and 23.9% of the responders revealed less than one-quarter of volume decrement. On the other hand, in over 70% of the centres, there was a significant surgical volume reduction. In addition to this, there was a shift in case-mix in 41 centres (89.1%) towards more complex cases. More than one-third of the responders revealed increased mortality in 2020 compared to previous years, and 43.5% of the programmes (20 centres) had at least one patient contaminated by SARS-Cov-2, accounting for 48 patients. Mortality in post-operative infected patients was 45.8% (22 patients). CONCLUSIONS: In general, Brazilian Pediatric and Congenital Heart Surgery programmes were severely affected by decreased surgical volume, unbalanced case-mix towards more complex cases, and increased mortality. Almost half of the programmes related post-operative COVID-19 contamination with high mortality.","Miana, Leonardo A; Manuel, Valdano; Antoniali, Fernando; Jatene, Marcelo B; Jatene, Fábio Biscegli",Cardiol Young,,168

It is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and no effective therapies currently exist against this novel viral agent. Along with extensive public health measures, an unprecedented global effort in identifying effective drugs for the treatment is being implemented. Potential drug targets are emerging as the result of a fast-evolving understanding of SARS-CoV-2 virology, host response to the infection, and clinical course of the disease. This brief review focuses on the latest and most promising pharmacological treatments against COVID-19 currently under investigation and discuss their potential use based on either documented efficacy in similar viral infections, or their activity against inflammatory syndromes.

296958,Factors influencing mental health among American youth in the time of the Covid-19 pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the social environment of most laborers around the world and has profoundly affected people's ontological security and behavior choices. Among them, the migrant workers are one of the groups most affected by the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study explored the mechanism of the impact of the scarcity of ontological security caused by the pandemic on the risk-taking tendency of migrant workers in China through two studies. METHODS: This study adopts two experimental method, with 514 participants in the first study and 357 participants in the second study. RESULTS: The results show that the pandemic-induced scarcity perception of ontological security promotes their risk-taking tendency, and the migrant workers' cognitive reflection ability, sense of unfairness and expected benefits play a significant mediating role in this process. The scarcity perception of ontological security promotes migrant workers' risk-taking tendency by reducing the cognitive reflection ability, triggering the sense of unfairness and overstating expected benefits. CONCLUSIONS: The conclusion of this study can help migrant workers, enterprises and government to avoid potential workplace and social bad behavior.","Yang, Qiang; Huo, Jiale; Xi, Yue",Work,,168
297368,The time to begin plans for COVID-19 eradication is now,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Currently conceptualized as an obsessive compulsive and related disorder, trichotillomania, or hair-pulling disorder, is a common illness that causes significant distress or functional impairments in various life domains. Most individuals with trichotillomania also have other comorbid diagnoses. Treating trichotillomania with pharmacotherapy is complicated since there are currently no FDA-approved drugs for its treatment. AREAS COVERED: The databases PubMed, PsychINFO, CINAHL, Evidence-based Medicine Reviews, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched, yielding a total of 10 open trials and 10 controlled trials selected. This review aims to examine pharmacotherapeutic options for the treatment of trichotillomania in adults and makes recommendations for the assessment and management of the disorder. EXPERT OPINION: There is preliminary evidence that clomipramine, olanzapine, and N-acetylcysteine may be effective in cases of trichotillomania, however, given the paucity of controlled studies with large sample sizes, decisions regarding the use of drugs should be made on a case-by-case basis taking into account the severity of trichotillomania and the nature of psychiatric comorbidity.","Baczynski, Christine; Sharma, Verinder",Expert Opin Pharmacother,,168

301608,Safety research in the midst of global health emergency,2021,"Most cases of stroke associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occur during the course of a characteristic COVID-19 respiratory illness. We report three patients where the presenting feature of COVID-19 was stroke. Two patients had no respiratory symptoms throughout their clinical course. In each case, COVID-19 was confirmed by a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test and the diagnosis of ischaemic stroke by brain imaging. The patients were relatively young (40, 45 and 50 years). None had a prior history of cerebrovascular events. Stroke risk factors were absent in one, limited to overweight and smoking in another but more prominent in the third patient. Two patients had large vessel occlusion and elevated D-dimer levels. Multiple infarcts were seen in two patients. Clinicians should consider the possibility of COVID-19 in patients presenting with stroke and conversely consider investigating for stroke if a patient with COVID-19, even if mildly ill, develops acute neurological symptoms. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

The aim of this study was to investigate the mutagenicity and carcinogenicity of VD3 alone or in combination with doxorubicin (DXR) using the Somatic Mutation and Recombination Test and the Epithelial Tumor Test, both in Drosophila melanogaster. For better understanding of the molecular interactions of VD3 and receptors, in silico analysis were performed with molecular docking associated with molecular dynamics. Findings revealed that VD3 alone did not increase the frequency of mutant spots, but reduced the frequency of mutant spots when co-administered with DXR. In addition, VD3 did not alter the recombinogenic effect of DXR in both ST and HB crosses. VD3 alone did not increase the total frequency of tumor, but significantly reduced the total frequency of tumor when co-administered with DXR. Molecular modeling and molecular dynamics between calcitriol and Ecdysone Receptor (EcR) showed a stable interaction, indicating the possibility of signal transduction between VD3 and EcR. In conclusion, under these experimental conditions, VD3 has modulatory effects on the mutagenicity and carcinogenicity induced by DXR in somatic cells of D. melanogaster and exhibited satisfactory interactions with the EcR.","Vasconcelos, Mirley Alves; Orsolin, Priscila Capelari; Oliveira, Victor Constante; Lima, Paula Marynella Alves Pereira; Naves, Maria Paula Carvalho; de Morais, Cássio Resende; Nicolau-Júnior, Nilson; Bonetti, Ana Maria; Spanó, Mário Antônio",Food Chem Toxicol,,168
307555,The Need for Community Practice to Support Aging in Place during COVID-19,2020,"Background and aims: Presently, human kind is challenging with a highly contagious disease, COVID-19, caused by a newly emerged virus, SARSCOV2 Health care providers are at the front line of fighting, as well as, at the risk of getting infected Many attempts have been made to combat the disease are mostly focused on hospital settings rather than outpatient settings so far Therefore, addressing the clinics and medical offices with numerous health care workers seems necessary Methods: Using keywords COVID-19 OR SARS-COV-2 OR Corona virus, AND Infection control OR Prevention AND (Outpatient settings) OR clinics OR (medical offices) AND (health care workers) OR (health care personnel) in databases and pertinent sites: PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Up - to-date, Clinical Key, Google Scholar, guidelines, and health organization like CDC, W H O , high impact journals, and publications of Iran ministry of health related to outpatient settings, the medical literature for all published full text articles pertinent to medical practice in clinics and medical offices and COVID-19 disease were searched All pertinent data were collected and then organized them in a step by step guide for health care workers Results: Based on findings, the majority of patients (80%) with COVID-19 have mild disease and no need to primarily be admitted to hospitals Since these patients are the source of infection, referrals to all clinics and hospitals have the risk of transmission of the infection to medical staff as well as, other non-COVID patients They could be quarantined at home, evaluated by physicians via telemedicine, receive appropriate medical advice, and followed up regularly Tele visit: Tele visit via telephone or video call eliminates unnecessary public or private transportation and the risk of transmission, as well as, face to face visits and exposing health care workers and other patients to the virus Regarding limited health care resources, face to face unnecessary visits impose dual pressure upon an already overloaded health care system Emergency departments and hospitals should be dedicated to the remaining 20% of COVID patients with moderate to severe disease Signs and Symptoms: Signs and symptoms of myriads of COVID-19 patients have been assessed 27 signs and symptoms have been found common to patients 4 out of 27 signs and symptoms most consistent with the disease are: fever, headache, fatigue, and myalgia/arthralgia Moreover, one of the relatively characteristic symptoms of COVID-19 disease is, sudden and recently- onset loss of smell and taste in the context of other signs and symptoms It should be differentiated from chronic and already present loss of smell, associated with chronic diseases like nasal polyposis, chronic sinusitis and neurologic problems Signs and symptoms of hemodynamic instability, like hypotension and reduced urine output, as well as, decreased level of consciousness, and chest pain are alarming and should be sought Patients with these conditions need to be admitted to hospitals Approaching patients with dyspnea remotely, Physicians should consider differential diagnoses like exacerbation of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), severe pneumonia, heart failure, pulmonary embolism, pericarditis, and anxiety Oxygen saturation evaluation: Patients could be instructed to monitor their oxygen saturation by home pulse oximeters twice a day and report it to physicians If oxygen saturation is 95% or more with room air, and not having other risk factors, they could remain quarantined at home Patients with oxygen saturation of 94% or less should be visited face to face in medical centers Elevator etiquette: If you have flu-like symptoms, do not use the elevator Keep a distance of 1 5 meter from other riders If the space is not enough, wait for the next turn ride or use the stairs Don't touch the buttons with naked hands;Touch them with tissue paper or your elbow instead Have disinfectant available and disinfect your hands before and after touching the buttons Do not touch your eyes, mouth and nose after touching the buttons Stay facing the walls of the elevator Wash or disinfect your hands immediately after getting off the elevator in case of touching buttons At the entrance of the clinic: Place posters, and stands with alarming and educational matters about COVID- 19 disease Screen all patients, as well as, companions for the signs and symptoms of COVID-19 Limit the entrance of companions to the clinic and not allow those who were exposed to COVID patients in recent two weeks Get all patients to wear masks and disinfect their hands with alcohol based disinfectant solutions before entering the clinic Waiting room: Limit the number of patients at the waiting room The distance between patients should be at least two meters Put partition between them if it is feasible Open the windows and doors 6-12 times per hour Have disinfectant solutions in the waiting room and soap in the washing closet available to all patients Cough etiquette: Cover your mouth and nose with tissue paper or your internal surface of your elbow in case of coughing or sneezing Discard the tissues in dustbin after coughing or sneezing and wash your hands Physician's room: Use a paperless system for transmitting medical records between physicians and secretory or para clinics The distance between physician and patient should be at least 2 meters Physicians should change the gloves after each visit The disposable table cloth should be changed and the table and all the surfaces touched by the patient should be disinfected after each visit Follow up of patients at home: Patients at home should be followed up regularly at daily basis and then setting up the frequency and duration of follow ups based on patient health condition Personal protective equipment: Medical staff should wear full personal protective equipment including N-95 Masks, goggles, face shields, gowns and gloves Monitoring medical and allied health care staff: Signs and symptoms of COVID-19 should be monitored regularly and the test RT-PCR should be performed every 3 days for health care workers in close contact with suspected COVID patients Return to work: Health care personnel could return to work from 10 to 20 days after onset of the disease, provided that symptoms have resolved and had been afebrile without the use of antipyretics for at least 24 hours Donning and Doffing: Errors in donning and doffing have been observed even among experienced personnel Therefore, the order of donning and doffing of personal protective equipment should be followed for prevention of infection Nebulizers and aerosol producing procedures: Given dispersing the virus particles by nebulizers around 10 meters, nebulizers and aerosol producing procedures, should not be used routinely in clinics unless the patient is isolated, the doors closed, and the personnel out of the room Conclusion: COVID-19 is a newly emerged and highly contagious disease Its diagnosis is based on multiple signs and symptoms, as well as, laboratory and imaging findings This disease has no approved treatment and all medications are used based on clinical trials so far Therefore, the best practice policy is prevention One of the available facilities that could help in prevention of the disease is telemedicine Around 80% of patients, who have mild disease, could be followed up, quarantined at home and managed by telemedicine Those at home should be monitored daily and if their condition worsened need to be admitted to special centers dedicated to COVID-19 patients They should not be referred to all clinics or admitted to all hospital wards Unnecessary referrals lead to spread of the infection Hospitals and clinics are already overloaded and medical personnel exhausted Medical personnel, as national resources should be preserved for the remaining 20% of patients with moderate to severe disease Since health care workers are exposed to the high load of the virus and they may receive the viral load from multiple sources, their disease is often more severe, the risk of mortal ty and the risk of transmitting the infection to others is higher than the general population Therefore,

316479,Deployment of information technology to facilitate patient care in the isolation ward during COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Background: Currently, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread globally, causing an unprecedented pandemic. However, there is no specific antiviral therapy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We conducted a clinical trial to compare the effectiveness of three antiviral treatment regimens in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. Methods: This was a single-center, randomized, open-labeled, prospective clinical trial. Eligible patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 were randomized into three groups: ribavirin (RBV) plus interferon-&#945; (IFN-&#945;), lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) plus IFN-&#945;, and RBV plus LPV/r plus IFN-&#945; at a 1:1:1 ratio. Each patient was invited to participate in a 28-d follow-up after initiation of an antiviral regimen. The outcomes include the difference in median interval to SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid negativity, the proportion of patients with SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid negativity at day 14, the mortality at day 28, the proportion of patients re-classified as severe cases, and adverse events during the study period. Results: In total, we enrolled 101 patients in this study. Baseline clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients were comparable among the three groups. In the analysis of intention-to-treat data, the median interval from baseline to SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid negativity was 12 d in the LPV/r+IFN-&#945;-treated group, as compared with 13 and 15 d in the RBV+IFN-&#945;-treated group and in the RBV+LPV/r+ IFN-&#945;-treated group, respectively (p=0.23). The proportion of patients with SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid negativity in the LPV/r+IFN-&#945;-treated group (61.1%) was higher than the RBV+ IFN-&#945;-treated group (51.5%) and the RBV+LPV/r+IFN-&#945;-treated group (46.9%) at day 14; however, the difference between these groups was calculated to be statistically insignificant. The RBV+LPV/r+IFN-&#945;-treated group developed a significantly higher incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events than the LPV/r+ IFN-&#945;-treated group and the RBV+ IFN-&#945;-treated group. Conclusions: Our results indicate that there are no significant differences among the three regimens in terms of antiviral effectiveness in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. Furthermore, the combination of RBV and LPV/r is associated with a significant increase in gastrointestinal adverse events, suggesting that RBV and LPV/r should not be co-administered to COVID-19 patients simultaneously.

317607,Nursing recommendations for facing dissemination of COVID-19 in Brazilian Nursing Homes,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus responsible for an outbreak of respiratory illness known as COVID-19, which has spread to several countries around the world and a global effort is being undertaken to characterize the molecular features and evolutionary origins of this virus. In silico analysis of the transcription start sites, promoter regions, transcription factors and their binding sites, gene ontology, CpG islands for SARS-CoV-2 viral genome are a first step to understand the regulation mechanisms of gene expression and its association with genetic variations in the genomes. For this purpose, we first computationally surveyed all SARS-CoV-2 virus genes with the open reading frames from NCBI database and found eleven sequences to accomplish the mentioned features by using bioinformatics tools. Our analysis revealed that all (100%) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus genes have more than one TSS. By taking all TSSs with the highest predictive score we determined promoter regions and identified five common candidate motifs (MVI, MVII, MVIII, MVIV and MVV) of which MVI was found to be shared by all promoter regions of SARS-CoV-2 virus genes with the least E-value (3.8e-056, statistically highly significant). In our further analysis of MVI we showed MVI serve as binding sites for a single transcription factor (TF) family, EXPREG, involved in the regulatory mode of these genes. From EXPREG family four TFs that belongs to Cyclic AMP (cAMP) receptor protein (CRP) and Catabolite control protein A (CcpA) group mostly serve as transcriptional activator whereas two TFs that belong to LexA group always serve as transcriptional repressor in different kinds of cellular processes and molecular functions. Therefore, we unfolded SARS-CoV-2 viral genome to shed light on its gene expression regulation that could help to design and evaluate diagnostic tests, to track and trace the ongoing outbreak and to identify potential intervention options.","Dinka, Hunduma; Milkesa, Ashenafi",Infect Genet Evol,,168
317710,An Innovative Way to Welcome Medical Students During This Unprecedented Time,2021,"There has been much discussion recently about the importance of implementing non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to protect the public from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Different governments across the world have adopted NPIs (e.g., social distancing, quarantine, isolation, lockdowns, curfews, travel restrictions, closures of schools and colleges). Two fundamental strategies, namely a strict containment strategy-also called suppression strategy-and a mitigation strategy have been adopted in different countries, mainly to reduce the reproduction number (R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) to below one and hence to reduce case numbers to low levels or eliminate human-to-human transmission, as well as to use NPIs to interrupt transmission completely and to reduce the health impact of epidemics, respectively. However, the adoption of these NPI strategies is varied and the factors impacting NPI are inconsistent and unclear. This study, therefore, aimed to review the factors associated with the implementation of NPIs (social distancing, social isolation and quarantine) for reducing COVID-19. Following PRISMA guidelines, we searched for published and unpublished studies, undertaking a systematic search of: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Allied and Complementary Medicine, COVID-19 Research, WHO database on COVID-19, and Google Scholar. Thirty-three studies were included in the study. Seven descriptive themes emerged on enablers and barriers to NPIs: the positive impact of NPIs, effective public health interventions, positive change in people's behaviour and concerns about COVID-19, the role of mass media, physical and psychological impacts, and ethnicity/age associated with COVID-19. This study has highlighted that the effectiveness of NPIs in isolation is likely to be limited, therefore, a combination of multiple measures e.g., SD, isolation and quarantine, and workplace distancing appeared more effective in reducing COVID-19. Studies suggest that targeted approaches alongside social distancing might be the way forward, and more acceptable. Further research to promote country- and context-specific adoption of NPIs to deliver public health measures is needed. Studies comparing the effectiveness of interventions and strategies will help provide more evidence for future pandemics.","Regmi, K.; Lwin, C.

318088,"Changes in criteria air pollution levels in the US before, during, and after Covid-19 stay-at-home orders: evidence from regulatory monitors (preprint)",2020,"Aim: Telemedicine is a promising solution to extend traditional health care services. Even though mainly discussed during the past two decades, its roots go back into the past century and even further, considering the use of bonfires to warn other villages of diseases. Insights from historical cases can therefore be useful for the ongoing discussion regarding the successful implementation of telemedicine. Subject and Methods: We analyzed three historical telemedicine cases (varying regarding time and place) and extracted their success factors and barriers as well as assessed their maturity by using the Telemedicine Community Readiness Model (TCRM). Evidence-based categories of success factors and barriers as well as the TCRM's dimensions were used as deductive categories to analyze the study material's content. Results: The analysis showed that the readiness for telemedicine is higher when the technology is the only option to access health care services. In all three cases, core readiness played a central role. However, the health sector, existing technology, and finance were barriers present at all times, while during pandemics, some barriers are only temporarily removed, for example, by putting legal issues on hold. The analyzed cases were all on lower levels of maturity as they mainly represent pilot tests or exceptional circumstances. Conclusion: Results indicate the important core functions in telemedicine initiatives as well as the diversity of their circumstances. Insights from such historical meta-perspectives can, for example, help to strengthen the sustainability of the increased use of telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic and scale up current telemedicine projects.","Reifegerste, Doreen; Harst, Lorenz; Otto, Lena",Z Gesundh Wiss,,168

However, as the literature on graph learning booms with a vast number of emerging methods and techniques, it becomes increasingly difficult to manually design the optimal machine learning algorithm for different graph-related tasks. To solve this critical challenge, automated machine learning (AutoML) on graphs which combines the strength of graph machine learning and AutoML together, is gaining attention from the research community. Therefore, we comprehensively survey AutoML on graphs in this paper, primarily focusing on hyper-parameter optimization (HPO) and neural architecture search (NAS) for graph machine learning. We further overview libraries related to automated graph machine learning and in-depth discuss AutoGL, the first dedicated open-source library for AutoML on graphs. In the end, we share our insights on future research directions for automated graph machine learning. This paper is the first systematic and comprehensive review of automated machine learning on graphs to the best of our knowledge.","Zhang, Ziwei; Wang, Xin; Zhu, Wenwu",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.00742v3.pdf,168
318528,Linking Health News to Research Literature,2021-07-14,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to understand the role of household variables on the percentage of physical activity (%PA) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) confinement in Portugal. STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional study design using an anonymous online survey was launched to assess how Portuguese families with children aged younger than 13 years adjusted their daily routines to the confinement. METHODS: Separate analyses of variance were performed to investigate how factors such as the number of children, age, sex, the housing characteristics, and the adults' job situation can affect the percentage of time for PA (%PA). RESULTS: Findings, based on data from 2159 children, indicate that (1) boys and girls did not differ in the %PA on any of the age-groups; (2) children with an outdoor space and who had other children in the household were significantly more active (P < .001); (3) children from families with all adults working from home showed lower levels of %PA; and (4) being younger, having a big outdoor space, having other children in the household, and having at least one adult free from working from home were significant positive predictors of children's %PA, explaining 21% of the overall variance. CONCLUSION: Time allocated for PA during this period is reduced compared with what is usually reported on normal days. It is necessary to find strategies to increase children's PA, especially in families in which both parents are working and have no outdoor space.","Pombo, A; Luz, C; Rodrigues, L P; Ferreira, C; Cordovil, R",Public Health,,168
319562,Anxiety associated with COVID-19 and concerns about death: Impacts on psychological well-being,2021,"SARS-CoV-2 is a highly infectious virus that is responsible for the COVID-19 global pandemic that swept the world in 2020. Disease outcomes range from asymptomatic to fatal. The virus initiates entry into host cells by the binding of its spike protein to the ACE2 receptor. Entry is finalized by the activation of spike glycoprotein by proteases including transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and FURIN which cleave the spike protein of the virus. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TMPRSS2 may lead to functional changes which could underlie differences in disease severity. TMPRSS2 is also known to activate different respiratory illnesses including coronaviruses and influenza A (Shen et al., 2020). Previous studies have shown that knockout TMPRSS2 mice appeared healthy, experienced a decrease in viral spread within the respiratory system, and had a less severe immune response when infected with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Baughn et al., 2020). Thus, we asked whether genetic variations in TMPRSS2 in humans lead to differences in infection rates or severity of disease symptoms of SARS-CoV-2. We examined the NCBI dbSNP database to identify SNPs in the TMPRSS2 gene. As of 10 December 2020, we found there were 11,023 intron variants, 393 missense variants, 186 synonymous variants, 3 in-frame insertion variants, 2 in-frame deletion variants, and 1 initiator codon variant reported. To narrow these down to 23 SNPs of interest, we first searched the ClinVar database to identify SNPs with general clinical significance, followed by searching the literature to determine SNPs specifically related to SARS-CoV-2 severity. One missense variant, rs12329760, results in an amino acid substitution, V160M, which has been predicted to alter TMPRSS2 function. A subset of these SNPs show differences in frequency in world populations, and we wondered if these SNPs had structural and functional consequences for the protein. A crystal structure of TMPRSS2 is not currently available. To visualize the structural consequences of amino acid substitutions, we performed homology modeling on TMPRSS2 (UniProt O15393) using the structure prediction software HHPred, RaptorX, and SwissModel based on the ~30% similarity to hepsin. The predicted structures of TMPRSS2 with various amino acid substitutions were then docked to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using I-TASSER and Haddock 2.4 to observe differences in binding interactions and therefore determine which sequence changes are predicted to alter binding interactions, potentially contributing to the wide variation of symptoms caused by COVID-19.

327429,Reply to John spry on stay-at home orders and COVID-19 hospitalizations,2020,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected more than 4 million people within 4 months. There is an urgent need to properly identify high-risk cases that are more likely to deteriorate even if they present mild diseases on admission. METHODS: A multicenter nested case-control study was conducted in four designated hospitals in China enrolling confirmed COVID-19 patients who were mild on admission. Baseline clinical characteristics were compared between patients with stable mild illness (stable mild group) and those who deteriorated from mild to severe illness (progression group). RESULTS: From Jan 17, 2020, to Feb 1, 2020, 85 confirmed COVID-19 patients were enrolled, including 16 in the progression group and 69 in the stable mild group. Compared to stable mild group (n = 69), patients in the progression group (n = 16) were more likely to be older, male, presented with dyspnea, with hypertension, and with higher levels of lactase dehydrogenase and c-reactive protein. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, advanced age (odds ratio [OR], 1.012; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.020-1.166; P = 0.011) and the higher level of lactase dehydrogenase (OR, 1.012; 95% CI, 1.001-1.024; P = 0.038) were independently associated with exacerbation in mild COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: Advanced age and high LDH level are independent risk factors for exacerbation in mild COVID-19 patients. Among the mild patients, clinicians should pay more attention to the elderly patients or those with high LDH levels.","Shi, Jichan; Li, Yang; Zhou, Xian; Zhang, Qiran; Ye, Xinchun; Wu, Zhengxing; Jiang, Xiangao; Yu, Hongying; Shao, Lingyun; Ai, Jing-Wen; Zhang, Haocheng; Xu, Bin; Sun, Feng; Zhang, Wenhong",BMC Med,,168
327533,Comparison Of Acute Covid19 Infected Athletes To Controls Through Electrocardiography,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The recent availability of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines has raised concerns in certain patient groups, such as those with multiple sclerosis. However, there are currently few publications that provide information on this issue. We pooled the information available on the safety and efficacy of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in patients with multiple sclerosis, with and without disease-modifying therapy. DEVELOPMENT: The study consisted in a literature search focused on the types of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, the current status of their approval, and the data available on the safety and efficacy of vaccines in patients with multiple sclerosis, including the new COVID-19 vaccines. Based on this search, the document has been designed taking into account current evidence and expert recommendations. There are no data on the safety and efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in patients with multiple sclerosis. However, evidence does exist to suggest that messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are as safe in these patients as in other individuals. Some therapies with immunosuppressants might reduce the effectiveness of these vaccines and require the scheduling of their administration, preferably before the start of treatment if possible. CONCLUSION: The data available make it possible to recommend mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 in patients with multiple sclerosis. In patients on fingolimod, cladribine, alemtuzumab, ocrelizumab and rituximab, vaccination prior to the initiation of medication administration would be recommendable whenever possible.","Costa Frossard-França, L; García-Domínguez, J M; Moreno-Torres, I; Fortún, J; Villar, L M; Meca-Lallana, V",Rev Neurol,,168

331012,Public Health Is Essential: COVID-19's Learnable Moment for Medical Education,2020,"Objectives The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to date, the epidemic has gradually spread to 209 countries worldwide with more than 1.5 million infected people and 100,000 deaths. Amplification of viral RNA by rRT-PCR serves as the gold standard for confirmation of infection, yet it needs a long turnaround time (3-4 h to generate results) and shows false-negative rates as large as 15%-20%. In addition, the need of certified laboratories, expensive equipment and trained personnel led many countries to limit the rRT-PCR tests only to individuals with pronounced respiratory syndrome symptoms. Thus, there is a need for alternative, less expensive and more accessible tests. Methods We analyzed the plasma levels of white blood cells (WBCs), platelets, C-reactive protein (CRP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), Î³-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of 207 patients who, after being admitted to the emergency room of the San Raffaele Hospital (Milan, Italy) with COVID-19 symptoms, were rRT-PCR tested. Of them, 105 tested positive, whereas 102 tested negative. Results Statistically significant differences were observed for WBC, CRP, AST, ALT and LDH. Empirical thresholds for AST and LDH allowed the identification of 70% of either COVID-19-positive or -negative patients on the basis of routine blood test results. Conclusions Combining appropriate cutoffs for certain hematological parameters could help in identifying false-positive/negative rRT-PCR tests. Blood test analysis might be used as an alternative to rRT-PCR for identifying COVID-19-positive patients in those countries which suffer from a large shortage of rRT-PCR reagents and/or specialized laboratory.","Ferrari, Davide; Motta, Andrea; Strollo, Marta; Banfi, Giuseppe; Locatelli, Massimo",Clin Chem Lab Med,,168

332621,Economic Policy Uncertainty in China and Bitcoin Returns: Evidence From the COVID-19 Period,2021,"BACKGROUND: Young people, aged 15-25 years, are at a critical stage of life when they need to navigate vocational pathways and achieve work and study outcomes. Those with mental health problems are particularly at risk of disengagement with work and study and need effective support. The headspace Work and Study (hWS) service is an innovative online platform implemented in Australia to support young people aged 15-25 years with mental health problems to achieve work and study goals. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine whether the hWS service has been implemented as planned, provides appropriate support for young people, and achieves its main goals. METHODS: Data were collected via 2 methodologies: (1) the hWS Minimum Data Set, which includes data on all clients in the service (n=1139), services delivered, and service impact; and (2) a survey of hWS clients who volunteered to participate in an evaluation of the hWS service (n=137). RESULTS: The service was accessed by its defined target group, young people aged 15-25 years with mental health and work and study difficulties. Young people found the online platform to be acceptable, and the assistance provided and clinical integration useful; many young people achieved positive work and study outcomes, particularly those who engaged more times with the service. More assistance was sought for work than study goals, suggesting that the transition to work may be particularly challenging for young people. One-third (298/881, 33.8%) of the sample for the service impact analyses achieved at least 1 primary work or study outcome, and this increased to 44.5% (225/506) for those who engaged with 5 or more sessions, demonstrating that greater engagement with the service produced better outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Critical work and study support can be effectively delivered via an online modality to young people with common mental health problems. Digital services are scaleable to reach many young people and are of particular value for those with difficulty accessing in-person services.","Rickwood, Debra; Kennedy, Vanessa; Miyazaki, Koki; Telford, Nic; Carbone, Stephen; Hewitt, Ella; Watts, Carolyn",JMIR Ment Health,,168
333702,Pre-graduation medical training including virtual reality during COVID-19 pandemic: a report on students' perception,2020,"Motivated by the issue of inaccurate channel state information (CSI) at the base station (BS), which is commonly due to feedback/processing delays and compression problems, in this paper, we introduce a scalable idea of adopting artificial intelligence (AI) aided CSI acquisition. The proposed scheme enhances the CSI compression, which is done at the mobile terminal (MT), along with accurate recovery of estimated CSI at the BS. Simulation-based results corroborate the validity of the proposed scheme. Numerically, nearly 100\% recovery of the estimated CSI is observed with relatively lower overhead than the benchmark scheme. The proposed idea can bring potential benefits in the wireless communication environment, e.g., ultra-reliable and low latency communication (URLLC), where imperfect CSI and overhead is intolerable.","Shehzad, Muhammad Karam; Rose, Luca; Assaad, Mohamad",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.00189v1.pdf,168

336614,Air pollution and COVID-19: Is the connect worth its weight?,2020,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection can lead to a constellation of viral and immune symptoms called coronavirus disease 2019. Emerging literature increasingly supports the premise that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 promotes a prothrombotic milieu. However, to date there have been no reports of acute aortic occlusion, itself a rare phenomenon. We report a case of fatal acute aortic occlusion in a patient with coronavirus disease 2019. CASE REPORT: A 59-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of peripheral vascular disease presented to the emergency department for evaluation of shortness of breath, fevers, and dry cough. His symptoms started 5-7 days prior to the emergency department visit, and he received antibiotics in the outpatient setting without any effect. He was found to be febrile, tachypneic, and hypoxemic. He was placed on supplemental oxygen via a non-rebreather mask. Chest X-ray showed multifocal opacifications. Intravenous antibiotics for possible pneumonia were initiated. Hydroxychloroquine was initiated to cover possible coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia. During the hospitalization, the patient became progressively hypoxemic, for which he was placed on bilevel positive airway pressure. D-dimer, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, and C-reactive protein were all elevated. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was positive. On day 3, the patient was upgraded to the intensive care unit. Soon after he was intubated, he developed a mottled appearance of skin, which extended from his bilateral feet up to the level of the subumbilical plane. Bedside ultrasound revealed an absence of flow from the mid-aorta to both common iliac arteries. The patient was evaluated emergently by vascular surgery. After a discussion with the family, it was decided to proceed with comfort-directed care, and the patient died later that day. DISCUSSION: Viral infections have been identified as a source of prothrombotic states due to direct injury of vascular tissue and inflammatory cascades. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 appears to follow a similar pattern, with numerous institutions identifying elevated levels of thrombotic complications. We believe that healthcare providers should be aware of both venous and arterial thrombotic complications associated with coronavirus disease 2019, including possible fatal outcome.","Minalyan, Artem; Thelmo, Franklin L; Chan, Vincent; Tzarnas, Stephanie; Ahmed, Faizan",J Med Case Rep,,168
338986,81 The Impact of COVID-19 on a Major Metropolitan Burn Center,2021,"PURPOSE: COVID-19 is a rapidly emerging worldwide pandemic that has drastically changed health care across the United States. Oncology patients are especially vulnerable. Novel point-of-care resources may be useful to rapidly disseminate peer-reviewed information from oncology experts nationwide. We describe our initial experience with distributing this information through a private, curated, virtual collaboration question-and-answer (Q&A) platform for oncologists. METHODS: The Q&A database was queried for a 2-month period from March 12 to May 12, 2020. We collected the total number of views and unique viewers for the questions. We classified the questions according to their emphasis (practice management, clinical management, both) and disease type across radiation oncology, medical oncology, gynecologic oncology, and pediatric oncology. RESULTS: Seventy-nine questions were approved, 67 of which were answered and generated 49,494 views with 5,148 unique viewers. Most discussions covered clinical management, with breast cancer being the most active disease site. Ten questions covered pediatric oncology and gynecologic oncology. Forty-seven percent of the 11,010 users of the platform visited the website during the 2-month period. CONCLUSION: Discussions on the Q&A platform reached a substantial number of oncologists throughout the nation and may help oncologists to modify their treatment in real time with the rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic.","Bejjani, Anthony; Burt, Lindsay; Washington, Christina; Terao, Michael; Housri, Samir; Housri, Nadine",JCO Clin Cancer Inform,,168

We evaluated PHTR implementation for US citizens on the Diamond Princess during its coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in Japan in February 2020 to explore how PHTR reduced importation of COVID-19 to the United States during the early phase of disease containment. Using PHTR required substantial collaboration among the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, other US government agencies, the cruise line, and public health authorities in Japan. Original US PHTR removal criteria were modified to reflect international testing protocols and enable removal of PHTR for persons who recovered from illness. The impact of PHTR on epidemic trajectory depends on the risk for transmission during travel and geographic spread of disease. Lessons learned from the Diamond Princess outbreak provide critical information for future PHTR use.","Medley, Alexandra M; Marston, Barbara J; Toda, Mitsuru; Kobayashi, Miwako; Weinberg, Michelle; Moriarty, Leah F; Jungerman, M Robynne; Surpris, Amethyst Clare A; Knust, Barbara; Acosta, Anna M; Shockey, Caitlin E; Daigle, David; Schneider, Zachary D; Charles, Julia; Ishizumi, Atsuyoshi; Stewart, Andrea; Vonnahme, Laura A; Brown, Clive; White, Stefanie; Cohen, Nicole J; Cetron, Marty",Emerg Infect Dis,,168

342142,Covid-19 and its impact on brain stimulation centres in the Lowlands,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Protecting healthcare workers from psychological harm is an urgent clinical issue within the current COVID-19 pandemic. Research on early psychological programmes that aim to prevent or reduce mental health symptoms and that have been tested in frontline responders may assist service providers with choosing a suitable intervention for rapid dissemination in healthcare settings. DESIGN AND OUTCOME MEASURES: First, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO and Google Scholar were searched through a systematic literature review of early psychological interventions administered to frontline responders in the last 15 years. Interventions were included if they were designed to prevent or reduce psychological impact and had outcome measures of psychological distress (eg, general psychopathology, post-traumatic stress disorder and stress) and/or positive mental health domains (eg, resilience, self-efficacy and life satisfaction). Second, the suitability of these programmes for the healthcare workforce was evaluated according to the criteria of effectiveness, content applicability and feasibility. RESULTS: Of 320 articles retrieved, 12 relevant studies were included that described six early psychological interventions. Although the evidence base is limited, psychological first aid, eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing, and trauma risk management showed effectiveness across at least two studies each with frontline workers. Resilience and coping for the healthcare community; anticipate, plan, and deter; and resilience at work programmes found promising results in single studies. Concerning other suitability criteria, all programmes appear applicable to healthcare settings and have acceptable feasibility for rapid implementation. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the limited evidence, several interventions were identified as potentially suitable and useful for improving psychological functioning of healthcare workers across a variety of disaster situations. Service providers should continue to implement and evaluate early psychological interventions in frontline workers in order to refine best practices for managing the psychological impact of future disasters.","Hooper, Jasmine Jean; Saulsman, Lisa; Hall, Tammy; Waters, Flavie",BMJ Open,,168
342404,Familial hypercholesterolaemia and cascade testing in general practice,2020,"BACKGROUND: A key purpose of the International Health Regulations (IHR) is to prevent unwarranted interruptions to trade and travel during large and/or transnational infectious disease outbreaks. Nevertheless, such outbreaks continue to disrupt the travel industry. This aspect of the IHR has received little attention in the academic literature despite its considerable impact on affected States and commercial activity. This article outlines the challenges and gaps in knowledge regarding the relationship between outbreaks and the travel sector and discusses the opportunities for further research and policy work to overcome these challenges. METHODOLOGY: We conducted a literature review on the relationship between outbreaks and travel restrictions, with a particular focus on the 2014-16 Ebola epidemic in West Africa. This review was complemented by an expert roundtable at Chatham House and further supported by case studies and qualitative interviews. RESULTS: Numerous travel stakeholders are affected by, and affect, large-scale infectious disease outbreaks. These stakeholders react in different ways: peer pressure plays an important role for both governments and the travel sector, and the reactions of the media and public influence and are influenced by these stakeholders. While various data sources on travel are available, and World Health Organization is mandated to work with States, there is no recognized coordinating body to disseminate timely, consistent, reliable and authoritative information and best practices to all stakeholders. CONCLUSION: This article highlights the interdependent relationship between various travel stakeholders. The reasons for interruption of travel during the 2014-16 Ebola outbreak were complex, with decisions by States only partly contributing to the cessation. Decisions by non-state actors, particularly the travel industry itself, contributed significantly and were based on a variety of factors. Further research, analysis and policy development are required to mitigate the health and economic consequences of infectious disease outbreaks. Any further research will also need to take account of COVID-19 travel-related issues.","Vaidya, Ria; Herten-Crabb, Asha; Spencer, Julia; Moon, Suerie; Lillywhite, Louis",J. travel med,,168

347632,Post-covid Cardiac Concerns In An Nfl Athlete,2021,"The fear of vaccines has led to population rejection due to various reasons. Students have had their own inquiries towards the effectiveness of the vaccination, which leads to vaccination hesitancy. Vaccination hesitancy can affect students’ perception, hence, acceptance of e-learning platforms. Therefore, this research attempts to explore the post-acceptance of e-learning platforms based on a conceptual model that has various variables. Each variable contributes differently to the post-acceptance of the e-learning platform. The research investigates the moderating role of vaccination fear on the post-acceptance of e-learning platforms among students. Thus, the study aims at exploring students’ perceptions about their post-acceptance of e-learning platforms where vaccination fear functions as a moderator. The current study depends on an online questionnaire that is composed of 29 items. The total number of respondents is 630. The collected data was implemented to test the study model and the proposed constructs and hypotheses depending on the Smart PLS Software. Fear of vaccination has a significant impact on the acceptance of e-learning platforms, and it is a strong mediator in the conceptual model. The findings indicate a positive effect of the fear of vaccination as a mediator in the variables: perceived ease of use and usefulness, perceived daily routine, perceived critical mass and perceived self-efficiency. The implication gives a deep insight to take effective steps in reducing the level of fear of vaccination, supporting the vaccination confidence among educators, teachers and students who will, in turn, affect the society as a whole.","Al-Maroof, Rana Saeed Alhumaid Khadija Akour Iman Salloum Said",Data,,168

This is of particular importance as nonverbal behaviours of collaboration partners in human-robot teams significantly influence the experience of the human interaction partners and the success of the collaborative task. During the Ars Electronica 2020 Festival for Art, Technology and Society (Linz, Austria), we invited visitors to exploratively interact with an industrial robot, exhibiting restricted interaction capabilities: extending and retracting its arm, depending on the movements of the volunteer. The movements of the arm were pre-programmed and telecontrolled for safety reasons (which was not obvious to the participants). We recorded video data of these interactions and investigated general nonverbal behaviours of the humans interacting with the robot, as well as nonverbal behaviours of people in the audience. Our results showed that people were more interested in exploring the robot's action and perception capabilities than just reproducing the interaction game as introduced by the instructors. We also found that the majority of participants interacting with the robot approached it up to a distance which would be perceived as threatening or intimidating, if it were a human interaction partner. Regarding bystanders, we found examples where people made movements as if trying out variants of the current participant's behaviour.","Krenn, Brigitte; Gross, Stephanie; Dieber, Bernhard; Pichler, Horst; Meyer, Kathrin",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.13812v1.pdf,168

An online survey was used to collect socio-demographic data, COVID-related fear (COVID-fear), nutrition, physical activity (PA) level and the symptoms of insomnia, depression and anxiety. Results: The prevalence of insomnia, depressive and anxiety symptoms was 37.80%, 48.20% and 36.70%, respectively, among Chinese adolescents during the pandemic. Generalized linear models revealed that female, left behind children, and students with greater COVID-fear tended to report symptoms of insomnia, depression and anxiety concurrently. After adjusting for socio-demographic factors and COVID-fear, better nutritional status and moderately active PA were both associated with lower levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms, while highly active PA was associated with lower levels of insomnia, depressive and anxiety symptoms. Conclusions: These findings suggest that more attention should be paid to psychological health among adolescents while combating COVID-19. To promote adolescents' mental health, educators should help adolescents develop a healthy lifestyle with balanced diet and regular exercise.","Chi, Xinli; Liang, Kaixin; Chen, Si-Tong; Huang, Qiaomin; Huang, Liuyue; Yu, Qian; Jiao, Can; Guo, Tianyou; Stubbs, Brendon; Hossain, Md Mahbub; Yeung, Albert; Kong, Zhaowei; Zou, Liye",Int J Clin Health Psychol,,168
353520,Mental health of healthcare professionals in China during the new coronavirus pandemic: an integrative review,2020,"In this article we address the question of how to measure the size and characteristics of the platform economy. We propose a~different, to sample surveys, approach based on smartphone data, which are passively collected through programmatic systems as part of online marketing. In particular, in our study we focus on two types of services: food delivery (Bolt Courier, Takeaway, Glover, Wolt and transport services (Bolt Driver, Free Now, iTaxi and Uber). Our results show that the platform economy in Poland is growing. In particular, with respect to food delivery and transportation services performed by means of applications, we observed a growing trend between January 2018 and December 2020. Taking into account the demographic structure of apps users, our results confirm findings from past studies: the majority of platform workers are young men but the age structure of app users is different for each of the two categories of services. Another surprising finding is that foreigners do not account for the majority of gig workers in Poland. When the number of platform workers is compared with corresponding working populations, the estimated share of active app users accounts for about 0.5-2% of working populations in 9 largest Polish cities.","Berkesewicz, Maciej; Nikulin, Dagmara; Szymkowiak, Marcin; Wilak, Kamil",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.12827v1.pdf,168

There is scant scientific evidence to guide surgeons in assessing the protocols that must be implemented before resuming elective orthopaedic surgery safely after the second wave of the coronavirus disease, 2019. METHODS: A retrospective review of elective orthopaedic surgeries performed between May 15, 2020, and November 20, 2020, was conducted. A screening questionnaire was used, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 immunoglobulin G and IgM antibodies testing were assessed in all admitted patients. Screening and testing data for coronavirus disease was reviewed for all patients. RESULTS: Of 592 patients tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 during the study period, 21 (3.5%) tested positive. There were 2 patients (0.3%) with positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction tests, 3 (0.5%) with positive IgG and IgM antibodies, 13 (2.2%) with positive IgG antibodies, and 10 (1.7%) with positive IgM antibodies. Among these 21 patients, 20 (95.2%) were asymptomatic. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that most elective orthopaedic surgery patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 are asymptomatic. In the second wave of coronavirus disease, 2019, universal testing of all patients should be strongly considered as an important measure to prevent clusters of in-hospital transmission of the disease.","Nakai, Tsuyoshi; Iwasaki, Haruaki; Nishikawa, Tomoya; Higuchi, Ryo; Sakata, Kosuke; Matsuoka, Hozo; Iwata, Hirokazu; Sogo, Eiji; Nanno, Katsuhiko; Nakamura, Shigeko; Kuroda, Sanae; Hayashi, Junzo; Nakata, Seizoh",J. orthop. sci,,168

Mobility plays a central role in this dilemma because the movement of people enables both economic activity and virus spread. We use mobility data in the form of counts of travelers between regions, to extend the often-used SEIR models to include mobility between regions. We quantify the trade-off between mobility and infection spread in terms of a single parameter, to be chosen by policy makers, and propose strategies for restricting mobility so that the restrictions are minimal while the infection spread is effectively limited. We consider restrictions where the country is divided into regions, and study scenarios where mobility is allowed within these regions, and disallowed between them. We propose heuristic methods to approximate optimal choices for these regions. We evaluate the obtained restrictions based on our trade-off. The results show that our methods are especially effective when the infections are highly concentrated, e.g., around a few municipalities, as resulting from superspreading events that play an important role in the spread of COVID-19. We demonstrate our method in the example of the Netherlands. The results apply more broadly when mobility data is available.","Gosgens, Martijn; Hendriks, Teun; Boon, Marko; Keuning, Stijn; Steenbakkers, Wim; Heesterbeek, Hans; Hofstad, Remco van der; Litvak, Nelly",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.14209v1.pdf,168
354588,Comparison of Estimated Rates of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Border Counties in Iowa Without a Stay-at-Home Order and Border Counties in Illinois With a Stay-at-Home Order,2020,"Communities of color in the United States have been disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Studies exploring the mental health implications of these disparities have only just begun to emerge. The purpose of this study is to better understand mental health concerns and test whether social determinants of health and COVID-19-related experiences influence these concerns. In April 2020, we launched a community-based survey for adults across the United States. A total of 341 respondents completed the survey, which included questions about demographics, depression, social isolation, work environment, and preexisting mental health conditions. We generated matched controls by adding county data from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to our survey. Chi square, Pearson product-moment correlation, point biserial correlation, and logistic regression were estimated. Our analysis revealed that respondents who identified as Latinx, Latin@, or Hispanic were 10 times more likely to meet the threshold score for depression. Similarly, individuals with prior mental health conditions and those who expressed feelings of social isolation due to COVID-19 were 3 times more likely to meet the threshold score for depression. These results confirm our hypothesis that communities of color will likely experience disproportionate mental health impacts of COVID-19-specifically, the mental health sequela that emerge from exposure, cumulative burden, and social isolation. We discuss the implications for expanding access and quality of health and mental health services to address current inequities.","Saltzman, Leia Y; Lesen, Amy E; Henry, Veronica; Hansel, Tonya C; Bordnick, Patrick S",Health Secur,,168

Our objective was to describe outcomes of COVID-19 patients suffering IHCA at a rural hospital in Southern California. METHODS: Single-center retrospective observational study. A hospital registry of COVID-19 patients was queried for all patients who suffered IHCA and received cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) between May 1st and July 31st, 2020. A manual chart review was performed to obtain patient demographics, oxygen requirement prior to cardiac arrest (CA), details of the resuscitation including presence of an emergency physician, and final disposition. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients were identified, most of whom were Hispanic, male, and aged 50-70. The most common medical comorbidities were diabetes and hypertension. Most patients suffered respiratory arrest, with an initial rhythm of pulseless electrical activity or asystole. Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was achieved in 3/9 patients already receiving mechanical ventilation, but all 3 expired within the following 24 h. ROSC was achieved in 10/12 patients not already intubated, though most also expired within a few days. The only 2 patients who survived to discharge suffered respiratory arrest after their oxygen delivery device dislodged. CONCLUSION: At a small rural hospital with limited resources and a predominantly Hispanic population, cardiac arrest in a COVID-19 patient portends an extremely poor prognosis. A better appreciation of these outcomes should help inform emergency providers and patients when discussing code status and attempts at resuscitation, particularly in resource limited settings.","Nene, Rahul V; Amidon, Nicole; Tomaszewski, Christian A; Wardi, Gabriel; Lafree, Andrew",Am J Emerg Med,,168

Subsequently, this association was confirmed by multiple case reports, cohort studies and meta-analyses. However, substantial geographical variability in prevalence of COVID-19 associated stroke underscores a persistent need of encompassing epidemiological study. Accumulative evidence suggested a rather complex underlying pathophysiology. Possible mechanisms include small and large vessel thromboembolism induced by systemic hypercoagubility, vasculitis and cardiac embolism caused by virus-induced cardiomyopathy. Multidisciplinary care of acute stroke patients in general does not seem to be compromised by the pandemic in otherwise compensated hospitals. However, it remains to be answered whether more aggressive approaches of secondary prevention and intensified monitoring strategies after COVID-19 related stroke are necessary to optimize clinical outcomes.

359657,Evaluation of the U.S. governors' decision when to issue stay-at-home orders,2020,"BACKGROUND: The first case of COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia was confirmed on March 3, 2020. Saudi Arabia, like many other countries worldwide, implemented lockdown of most public and private services in response to the pandemic and established population movement restrictions nationwide. With the implementation of these strict mitigation regulations, technology and digital solutions have enabled the provision of essential services. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to highlight how Saudi Arabia has used digital technology during the COVID-19 pandemic in the domains of public health, health care services, education, telecommunication, commerce, and risk communication. METHODS: We documented the use of digital technology in Saudi Arabia during the pandemic using publicly available official announcements, press briefings and releases, news clips, published data, peer-reviewed literature, and professional discussions. RESULTS: Saudi Arabia's government and private sectors combined developed and launched approximately 19 apps and platforms that serve public health functions and provide health care services. A detailed account of each is provided. Education processes continued using an established electronic learning infrastructure with a promising direction toward wider adoption in the future. Telecommunication companies exhibited smooth collaboration as well as innovative initiatives to support ongoing efforts. Risk communication activities using social media, websites, and SMS text messaging followed best practice guides. CONCLUSIONS: The Saudi Vision 2030 framework, released in 2017, has paved the path for digital transformation. COVID-19 enabled the promotion and testing of this transition. In Saudi Arabia, the use of artificial intelligence in integrating different data sources during future outbreaks could be further explored. Also, decreasing the number of mobile apps and merging their functions could increase and facilitate their use.","Hassounah, Marwah; Raheel, Hafsa; Alhefzi, Mohammed",J Med Internet Res,,168
360974,Differences between quality of life and occupational coping of tenured and outsourced nurses,2020,"It has been reported that robotics-aided care can contribute to enhancing older people's social participation and quality of life in nursing homes, while simultaneously reducing the burden on care professionals at nighttime. Due to increasing demand for social care and the relative workforce shortage, it is likely that a greater number and variety of robots will be introduced and implemented in the future. While the benefits of applying robots and assistive technologies are recognized, the current limitations and weaknesses have also been identified. One of these is the difficulty associated with a user-centered design, involving older adults with impaired cognitive and sensory abilities in nursing homes. In order to overcome this challenge, a project was carried out to develop a soft and compact bedside communication robot with an input/output device, connected to existing technologies (e.g. monitoring camera, biological sensor). Drawing on the principle of gemba (deference to frontline professionals' experience, expertise and skills), users' feedback was reflected in the iterative steps of robot development. The original soft and communicative robot was introduced and its effectiveness was tested by measuring older people's reactions and changes in their behaviors and engagement levels. The article reports the development process and results of a small-scale evaluation study, comparing the impact of this original soft-type robot with and without its communicative functions. The human-robot interactions were captured on video, and the analysis revealed that while communicative robots reduced the psychosocial burden on older adults, positive emotional, verbal, visual and behavioral engagement was generated with the help of the non-verbal plush toy.","Obayashi, Kazuko; Kodate, Naonori; Masuyama, Shigeru",Int J Soc Robot,,168

Doctors may choose for use anti-coagulation doses to treat the patients at intensive care units. A rapid, easy, and low-cost solution to monitor the coagulation status at the point-of-care may help with treatment by enabling the administration of controlled doses of medication to patients and to understand the disease's underlying pathophysiology. Thromboelastography, the clinical standard is accurate; it suffers from limited portability and low sensitivity when miniaturized to handheld form factor. In the article, we summarize research helping to advance towards an integrated optofluidic device combining microfluidics and photonic sensor technology. Microfluidics are used to perform blood pre-processing, and a photonic sensor measures blood coagulation status in real-time readout on the device itself. These techniques make it portable and scalable, potentially serving as technology foundation for the development of a disposable sensor for point-of-care diagnostics in COVID-19 patients and coagulopathy in general.","Singh, Robin; Frydman, Alex Benjamin Galit; Kimerling, Lionel; Agarwal, Anu; Anthony, Brian W",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.02081v1.pdf,168

One concern among transplant stakeholders was that public focus on OPO underperformance would harm deceased donation. Using CDC-WONDER data, we studied whether donation performance dropped during the era of public debate about OPO reform (December 2018-February 2020). Overall OPO performance as measured relative to cause, age, and location-consistent deaths rose by 12.3% in 2019, compared to a median annual change of 2.5% 2009-2019. Organ recoveries exceeded seasonally adjusted forecasts by 4.2% in the first half of 2019, by 8.1% following the Executive Order issuing a mandate for OPO metric reform, and by 14.1% between the Notice of Public Rule Making and the onset of COVID-19-related systemic disruptions. We describe changes in donor phenotype in the period of increased performance; improvement was greatest for older and donation after cardiac death (DCD) donors, and among decedents who did not have a drug-related mechanism of death. In summary, performance during an era of intense public debate and proposed regulatory changes yielded 692 additional donors over expectations, and no detriment to organ donation was observed.","Doby, Brianna L; Ross-Driscoll, Katie; Shuck, Marion; Wadsworth, Matthew; Durand, Christine M; Lynch, Raymond J",Am. j. transplant,,168

Mangroves vary substantially according to their geomorphic and sedimentary setting; while several conceptual frameworks describe these settings, their spatial distribution has not been quantified. Here, we present a new global mangrove biophysical typology and show that, based on their 2016 extent, 40.5% (54,972 km2) of mangrove systems were deltaic, 27.5% (37,411 km2) were estuarine and 21.0% (28,493 km2) were open coast, with lagoonal mangroves the least abundant (11.0%, 14,993 km2). Mangroves were also classified based on their sedimentary setting, with carbonate mangroves being less abundant than terrigenous, representing just 9.6% of global coverage. Our typology provides a basis for future research to incorporate geomorphic and sedimentary setting in analyses. We present two examples of such applications. Firstly, based on change in extent between 1996 and 2016, we show while all types exhibited considerable declines in area, losses of lagoonal mangroves (- 6.9%) were nearly twice that of other types. Secondly, we quantify differences in aboveground biomass between mangroves of different types, with it being significantly lower in lagoonal mangroves.

365873,Public health lessons: Odisha's management of the covid-19 pandemic,2020,"RATIONALE Patients with COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) are at high-risk for severe COVID-19 infection. Assessing when these patients should be evaluated for COVID-19 can be difficult because they often have chronic respiratory symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, and sputum production, at baseline. Very little data exists on how patients with COPD present with COVID-19 and which symptoms are associated with a higher risk for COVID-19 infection. The aim of this study was to investigate the symptoms most associated with positive COVID-19 status in patients with COPD. METHODS We investigated 1468 patients with a diagnosis of COPD who were tested for COVID-19 using the Cleveland Clinic COVID-19 registry from 03/8/2020 to 06/08/2020. Testing for COVID-19 at our facility was only indicated for symptomatic patients. We excluded individuals with the concurrent diagnosis of asthma, those with less than a 10 pack-year smoking history, and those 35 years of age and younger to minimize bias and uncertainty about the diagnosis of COPD. Results were analyzed via a multivariate logistic regression adjusted for gender, race, age, smoking status, and comorbidities associated with increased risk of COVID-19 infection (diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and history of malignancy). RESULTS Out of a total of 1468 patients, 223 (15.2%) tested positive for COVID-19. Compared to patients with COPD who tested negative, those who tested positive were more likely to endorse fatigue (62.0% vs 40.3%, p&lt;0.001), flu-like symptoms (57.6% vs 36.0%, p&lt;0.001), diarrhea (26.8% vs 17.2%, p=0.009), and loss of appetite (43.5% vs 14.1%, p&lt;0.001). Respiratory symptoms were commonly reported, but not significantly different compared to COVID negative patients (cough: 76.2% vs 75.3%, p=0.88;sputum production: 37.2% vs 32.9%, p=0.43;dyspnea: 75.3% vs 77.9%, p=0.53). When adjusted in multivariate logistic regression, COPD patients had higher odds of testing positive when reporting fatigue (adj OR 2.57, CI: 1.72-3.87), flu-like symptoms (adj OR 2.95, CI: 1.99-4.41), diarrhea (adj OR 2.05, CI: 1.31-3.16), or loss of appetite (adj OR 5.03, CI: 3.19-7.95). CONCLUSIONS In this study, we found that patients with COPD who were tested for COVID-19 demonstrated that constitutional and gastrointestinal symptoms were more often associated with a positive COVID-19 test compared to respiratory symptoms. These findings highlight the importance of investigating additional symptoms other than respiratory in patients with COPD to help predict COVID-19 positivity. .","Smith, W.

368561,World Health Organization Academy: COVID-19 Learning and WHO Info Mobile Apps,2020,"The early identification of asymptomatic yet infectious cases is vital to curb the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and to control the disease in the post-pandemic era. In this paper, we propose a fast, inexpensive and high-throughput approach using painless nasal-swab self-collection followed by direct RT-qPCR for the sensitive PCR detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This approach was validated in a large prospective cohort study of 1038 subjects, analysed simultaneously using (1) nasopharyngeal swabs obtained with the assistance of healthcare personnel and analysed by classic two-step RT-qPCR on RNA isolates and (2) nasal swabs obtained by self-collection and analysed with direct RT-qPCR. Of these subjects, 28.6% tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 using nasopharyngeal swab sampling. Our direct RT-qPCR approach for self-collected nasal swabs performed well with results similar to those of the two-step RT-qPCR on RNA isolates, achieving 0.99 positive and 0.98 negative predictive values (cycle threshold [Ct] < 37). Our research also reports on grey-zone viraemia, including samples with near-cut-off Ct values (Ct &#8805; 37). In all investigated subjects (n = 20) with grey-zone viraemia, the ultra-small viral load disappeared within hours or days with no symptoms. Overall, this study underscores the importance of painless nasal-swab self-collection and direct RT-qPCR for mass testing during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and in the post-pandemic era.","Kriegova, Eva; Fillerova, Regina; Raska, Milan; Manakova, Jirina; Dihel, Martin; Janca, Ondrej; Sauer, Pavel; Klimkova, Martina; Strakova, Petra; Kvapil, Petr",Virol J,,168
368950,Assessment of the effects of health and financial threat on prosocial and antisocial responses during the COVID-19 pandemic: The mediating role of empathic concern,2021,"The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a world pandemic due to COVID-19, and several enacted measures such as compulsory confinement may have collateral consequences on both physical and mental health. We aimed to investigate associations between current physical activity (PA) and current perceived anxiety and mood among a sample of Spanish adults confined due to COVID-19 restrictions of movement. Using an online survey, we collected data on the Spanish adult population regarding health habits during the first days of enacted confinement. A total of 2250 participants (54.8% women) aged 35.3 (SD 13.6) completed the survey, which included questions about sociodemographic characteristics (i.e. age, gender, civil status, education, and occupation), health habits (i.e. prior PA, alcohol consumption, smoking, screen exposure, and sleep hours) and COVID-19 confinement context (i.e. number of isolation days, solitude, and exposure to COVID-19). Physical Activity Vital Sign (PAVS) short form was used to estimate weekly minutes of PA, whereas a single-item question was used to assess both current perceived anxiety and mood. We conducted weighted binomial logistic regressions to check associations between current adherence to WHO guidelines of PA and current perceived anxiety and mood of confined adults. Significant inverse associations between overall adherence to PA and current perceived anxiety in the final adjusted model (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.54–0.79) as well as in several subgroup analyses such as younger women were observed. In addition, a borderline significant inverse association was found between current PA and current perceived worse mood when fully adjusted (OR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.68–1.00); this association was significantly stronger in women than men. The results of the present study indicate that current PA adherence to WHO guidelines in the initial phase of COVID-19 confinement associates with both lower current perceived anxiety and lower current perceived worse mood among a sample of Spanish adults.","López-Bueno, Rubén; Calatayud, Joaquín; Ezzatvar, Yasmin; Casajús, José A.; Smith, Lee; Andersen, Lars L.; López-Sánchez, Guillermo F.",Front.

370693,That question again,2020,"Background: Anti-melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) associated idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM) often manifests with minimal muscle weakness and rapidly progressive interstitial lung disease (RP-ILD) with a poor prognosis. The clinical presentation may be varied in different ethnic groups. The ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has made management even more challenging as certain manifestations may be difficult to diagnose remotely. Aim of the work: To throw light on the rare association of CMV infection in established anti-MDA5 myositis with severe consequences. Similar cases were presented and compared. Case report: A 42-year-old lady presented with heliotrope rash, periorbital edema, ulcerated Gottron's papules, proximal muscle weakness and intermittent fever of six-month duration. Anti-MDA5 antibodies were positive. Active disease, including myocarditis and RP-ILD, were challenging to diagnose on teleconsultation. Upon initiating tofacitinib, cytomegalovirus (CMV) polymerized chain reaction (PCR) came positive. Ganciclovir was started with the possibility of viral activation being the potential driving force for interferon pathway activation and dermatomyositis (DM) flare, but the patient succumbed to the illness. Conclusion: Viral triggers are known to induce autoimmune disease in the genetically predisposed. However, CMV infection in established anti-MDA5 myositis is uncommon and further association with myocarditis is a rare occurrence. Ulcerated Gottron's and periorbital oedema may carry a sinister connotation in Indians with anti-MDA5 DM, with worse manifestations such as myocarditis– which albeit rare, can be fatal. © 2021 THE AUTHORS","Gupta, P.; Kharbanda, R.; Lawrence, A.; Gupta, L.",Egyptian Rheumatologist,,168

373840,Clinical PET/CT utilization during the COVID-19 pandemic: initial experience at Yale University,2021,"The global pandemic of coronavirus disease has significantly impacted medical education, including removing trainees from clinical environments, transitioning didactic sessions to virtual platforms, and necessitating creative solutions to provide interactive learning opportunities in a virtual, socially distant setting. Human gross anatomy education, with its emphasis on hands-on, team-based, active learning by body donor dissection, has been particularly impacted by these transitions. Dissection is considered the best practice for learning gross anatomy and has been shown to enhance learning over non-dissection-based methods. At the Medical College of Wisconsin, team-based, body donor dissections are the basis for the Clinical Human Anatomy course. However, the pandemic necessitated changes to the format of laboratory activities. For the 2020-2021 academic year, students either completed anatomy labs in-person in a socially distant environment or virtually. This provided an opportunity to directly compare the effect of different laboratory instructional modalities on student performance within a single course. All first-year medical students were enrolled in the same Clinical Human Anatomy course, attended identical didactic sessions, and were assessed by identical examinations that included lecture-based questions as well as laboratory image-based questions. As the semester progressed and coronavirus disease case numbers rose, students were offered two options for completing laboratory instruction: (1) continue dissections in socially distant pairs or (2) transition to a virtual lab format. The virtual lab format included a self-directed module which guided students through the dissections they would have done in person. Each module consisted of a PowerPoint presentation that incorporated interactive software (3D4Medical Complete Anatomy) and dissection images. The self-directed modules were followed by interactive Zoom sessions, wherein faculty reviewed a prosection and posed clinically relevant questions to the meeting attendees. Students who opted for the virtual lab format were able to review dissections in-person on their own time or with a tutor. Likewise, students who opted to continue dissection had access to the virtual modules and recordings of the Zoom sessions. Comparison between students completing labs virtually or in-person showed no difference in aggregate performance on examinations. This study examined medical knowledge and did not investigate other competencies impacted by lab activities (teamwork, dealing with death, and the ?first patient? experience). We consider hands-on dissection to be the gold-standard format for learning gross anatomy, but this study showed by direct comparison in a single course, that multiple laboratory formats can yield equivalent understanding of the complex structure of the body.","Hillmer, Ryan Krippendorf Beth Patitucci Teresa",The FASEB Journal,,168

Specifically, in Madagascar, the percentage of stunted children under 5 is extremely high. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to increase the risk of all forms of malnutrition, especially in low-income countries, including Madagascar, with serious intergenerational repercussions. This narrative review aims at investigating eating habits and cooking methods of the Malagasy population, addressing sustainable healthy diets through promotion of novel foods. While novel foods are a recent concept, there are data that describe how they may contribute to counteract food insecurity and malnutrition considering context and place. Efforts to promote native, traditional foods as Moringa oleifera, an indigenous plant in Asia and Africa including Madagascar, rich in protein and micronutrients, as well as edible insects, alternative sustainable source of protein, lipids, iron, and zinc, would provide not only nutritional but also cultural and economic benefits. The potential synergies between food traditions and agroecology have the potential to impact health addressing larger issues of sustainability and food security.

377153,Do coping responses predict better/poorer mental health in Portuguese adults during Portugal's national lockdown associated with the COVID-19?,2021,"Effectively monitoring the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants is essential to efforts to counter the ongoing pandemic. Wastewater monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 RNA has proven an effective and efficient technique to approximate COVID-19 case rates in the population. Predicting variant abundances from wastewater, however, is technically challenging. Here we show that by sequencing SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater and applying computational techniques initially used for RNA-Seq quantification, we can estimate the abundance of variants in wastewater samples. We show by sequencing samples from wastewater and clinical isolates in Connecticut U.S.A. between January and April 2021 that the temporal dynamics of variant strains broadly correspond. We further show that this technique can be used with other wastewater sequencing techniques by expanding to samples taken across the United States in a similar timeframe. We find high variability in signal among individual samples, and limited ability to detect the presence of variants with clinical frequencies <10%; nevertheless, the overall trends match what we observed from sequencing clinical samples. Thus, while clinical sequencing remains a more sensitive technique for population surveillance, wastewater sequencing can be used to monitor trends in variant prevalence in situations where clinical sequencing is unavailable or impractical.","Baaijens, Jasmijn A.; Zulli, Alessandro; Ott, Isabel M.; Petrone, Mary E.; Alpert, Tara; Fauver, Joseph R.; Kalinich, Chaney C.; Vogels, Chantal B.F.; Breban, Mallery I.; Duvallet, Claire; McElroy, Kyle; Ghaeli, Newsha; Imakaev, Maxim; Mckenzie-Bennett, Malaika; Robison, Keith; Plocik, Alex; Schilling, Rebecca; Pierson, Martha; Littlefield, Rebecca; Spencer, Michelle; Simen, Birgitte B.; Initiative, - Yale SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Surveillance; Hanage, William P.; Grubaugh, Nathan D.; Peccia, Jordan; Baym, Michael",,,168

The current study aims to investigate and analyze the people top concerns and sentiment dynamics expressed in physician online reviews (PORs). (2) Methods: Text data were collected from four U.S.-based PRWs during the three time periods of 2018, 2019 and 2020. Based on the dynamic topic modeling, hot topics related to different aspects of healthcare were identified. Following the hybrid approach of aspect-based sentiment analysis, the social network of prevailing topics was also analyzed whether people expressed positive, neutral or negative sentiments in PORs. (3) Results: The study identified 30 dominant topics across three different stages which lead toward four key findings. First, topics discussed in Stage III were quite different from the earlier two stages due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Second, based on the keyword co-occurrence analysis, the most prevalent keywords in all three stages were related to the treatment, questions asked by patients, communication problem, patients' feelings toward the hospital environment, disease symptoms, time spend with patients and different issues related to the COVID-19 (i.e., pneumonia, death, spread and cases). Third, topics related to the provider service quality, hospital servicescape and treatment cost were the most dominant topics in Stages I and II, while the quality of online information regarding COVID-19 and government countermeasures were the most dominant topics in Stage III. Fourth, when zooming into the topic-based sentiments analysis, hot topics in Stage I were mostly positive (joy be the dominant emotion), then negative (disgust be the dominant emotion) in Stage II. Furthermore, sentiments in the initial period of Stage III (COVID-19) were negative (anger be the dominant emotion), then transformed into positive (trust be the dominant emotion) later. The findings also revealed that the proposed method outperformed the conventional machine learning models in analyzing topic and sentiment dynamics expressed in PRWs. (4) Conclusions: Methodologically, this research demonstrates the ability and importance of computational techniques for analyzing large corpora of text and complementing conventional social science approaches.","Shah, Adnan Muhammad; Naqvi, Rizwan Ali; Jeong, Ok-Ran",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,168

We aimed to determine whether the blockade of the renin-angiotensin system is associated with a worse clinical course of COVID-19, and to evaluate what clinical variables are associated with COVID severity in our population. We included adult subjects with rtPCR-confirmed COVID-19. The use of renin system inhibitors was defined according to its registration in the electronic medical record or the hospital pharmacy registry during the previous three months. Our endpoint was a composite of death or mechanical ventilation requirement. Patients were followed up until discharge or death. A multiple logistic regression model was used to determine the predictors of the composite endpoint. In all, we included 4930 COVID+ patients, the median age was 52 years, and 48.1% were male. The endpoint occurred in 488 patients (9.9%). In adjusted analysis, neither angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors nor angiotensin receptor blockers were associated with the outcome. Independent predictors of mortality and/or mechanical ventilation requirement were age, male sex, a history of diabetes and/or chronic kidney disease, smoking and dementia. To conclude, renin system inhibitors seem to be unrelated to COVID-19 severity, whereas prognosis is independently associated with age, male sex and comorbidities.","Barochiner, J.; Martínez, R.; Conti, P.

The primary aim of the study is to describe the chronology of lung pathologic changes in COVID-19 by using a post-mortem transbronchial lung cryobiopsy approach. Our secondary aim is to correlate the histologic findings with computed tomography patterns. SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, who died while intubated and mechanically ventilated, were enrolled. The procedure was performed 30 min after death, and all lung lobes sampled. Histopathologic analysis was performed on thirty-nine adequate samples from eight patients: two patients (illness duration < 14 days) showed early/exudative phase diffuse alveolar damage, while the remaining 6 patients (median illness duration-32 days) showed progressive histologic patterns (3 with mid/proliferative phase; 3 with late/fibrotic phase diffuse alveolar damage, one of which with honeycombing). Immunohistochemistry for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein was positive predominantly in early-phase lesions. Histologic patterns and tomography categories were correlated: early/exudative phase was associated with ground-glass opacity, mid/proliferative lesions with crazy paving, while late/fibrous phase correlated with the consolidation pattern, more frequently seen in the lower/middle lobes. This study uses an innovative cryobiopsy approach for the post-mortem sampling of lung tissues from COVID-19 patients demonstrating the progression of fibrosis in time and correlation with computed tomography features. These findings may prove to be useful in the correct staging of disease, and this could have implications for treatment and patient follow-up.","Barisione, Emanuela; Grillo, Federica; Ball, Lorenzo; Bianchi, Rita; Grosso, Marco; Morbini, Patrizia; Pelosi, Paolo; Patroniti, Nicolò Antonino; De Lucia, Arduino; Orengo, Giovanni; Gratarola, Angelo; Verda, Marta; Cittadini, Giuseppe; Mastracci, Luca; Fiocca, Roberto",Virchows arch,,168

The majority of U.S. HCW deaths are male (64.1%). General practitioners and family medicine and primary care physicians account for 26.9% of physician deaths. Anesthesiologists and emergency medicine and critical care physicians account for 7.4%. The United States has the highest number of HCW deaths but a similar number as a fraction of national cases and deaths compared with other developed countries. CONCLUSIONS: Among HCWs globally, in the United States there have been more reported deaths of physicians, primary care physicians, males, and HCWs versus opposing groups. Further research is needed to understand relative risks of death due to COVID-19 in each of these demographic groups.","Gouda, Divakara; Singh, Preet Mohinder; Gouda, Prabhakara; Goudra, Basavana",J Am Board Fam Med,,168
387307,Endocrine Insights into the Pathophysiology of Autism Spectrum Disorder,2020,"The Hopi Tribe is a sovereign nation home to ~7500 Hopi persons living primarily in 12 remote villages. The Hopi Tribe, like many other American Indian nations, has been disproportionately affected by COVID-19. On 18 May 2020, a team from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was deployed on the request of the tribe in response to increases in COVID-19 cases. Collaborating with Hopi Health Care Center (the reservation's federally run Indian Health Service health facility) and CDC, the Hopi strengthened public health systems and response capacity from May to August including: (1) implementing routine COVID-19 surveillance reporting; (2) establishing the Hopi Incident Management Authority for rapid coordination and implementation of response activities across partners; (3) implementing a community surveillance programme to facilitate early case detection and educate communities on COVID-19 prevention; and (4) applying innovative communication strategies to encourage mask wearing, hand hygiene and physical distancing. These efforts, as well as community adherence to mitigation measures, helped to drive down cases in August. As cases increased in September-November, the improved capacity gained during the first wave of the pandemic enabled the Hopi leadership to have real-time awareness of the changing epidemiological landscape. This prompted rapid response coordination, swift scale up of health communications and redeployment of the community surveillance programme. The Hopi experience in strengthening their public health systems to better confront COVID-19 may be informative to other indigenous peoples as they also respond to COVID-19 within the context of disproportionate burden.","Humeyestewa, Duane; Burke, Rachel M; Kaur, Harpriya; Vicenti, Darren; Jenkins, Royce; Yatabe, Graydon; Hirschman, Jocelyn; Hamilton, Joyce; Fazekas, Kathleen; Leslie, Gary; Sehongva, Gregory; Honanie, Kay; Tu039,; tsi, Edison; Mayer, Oren; Rose, Michelle Ann; Diallo, Yvette; Damon, Scott; Zilversmit Pao, Leah; McCraw, H Mac; Talawyma, Bruce; Herne, Mose; Nuvangyaoma, Timothy L; Welch, Seh; Balajee, S Arunmozhi",,,168
387933,COVID-19 as a global challenge: towards an inclusive and sustainable future,2020,"Animal models of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders require extensive behavioral phenotyping. Currently, this presents several caveats and the most important are: (i) rodents are nocturnal animals, but mostly tested during the light period; (ii) the conventional behavioral experiments take into consideration only a snapshot of a rich behavioral repertoire; and (iii) environmental factors, as well as experimenter influence, are often underestimated. Consequently, serious concerns have been expressed regarding the reproducibility of research findings on the one hand, and appropriate welfare of the animals (based on the principle of 3Rs-reduce, refine and replace) on the other hand. To address these problems and improve behavioral phenotyping in general, several solutions have been proposed and developed. Undisturbed, 24/7 home-cage monitoring (HCM) is gaining increased attention and popularity as demonstrating the potential to substitute or complement the conventional phenotyping methods by providing valuable data for identifying the behavioral patterns that may have been missed otherwise. In this review, we will briefly describe the different technologies used for HCM systems. Thereafter, based on our experience, we will focus on two systems, IntelliCage (NewBehavior AG and TSE-systems) and Digital Ventilated Cage (DVC®, Tecniplast)-how they have been developed and applied during recent years. Additionally, we will touch upon the importance of the environmental/experimenter artifacts and propose alternative suggestions for performing phenotyping experiments based on the published evidence. We will discuss how the integration of telemetry systems for deriving certain physiological parameters can help to complement the description of the animal model to offer better translation to human studies. Ultimately, we will discuss how such HCM data can be statistically interpreted and analyzed.","Voikar, Vootele; Gaburro, Stefano",Front Behav Neurosci,,168

Its antiviral properties have been studied for years; regarding the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Corona Virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), it has been shown that HCQ may act at multiple levels. These extend from the initial attachment of the virus to the respiratory epithelium to the inhibition of its replication by the alkalinisation of the phagolysosome's microenvironment and the post-translational modification of certain viral proteins. Preliminary clinical evidence from China and France showed significant virological and clinical benefit in HCQ-treated patients, while other studies, mostly including critically ill patients, did not show favorable results. In this review, we critically appraise the existing evidence on HCQ against SARS-CoV-2 with particular emphasis on its protective and therapeutic role. Safety concerns that are relevant to the short-term HCQ use are also discussed. In the context of the rapid evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic that strains the health care systems worldwide and considering limited population-wide testing rates in most of the vulnerable countries, early empiric short-term administration of HCQ in symptomatic individuals, may be a promising, safe and low-cost strategy.","Tselios, Konstantinos; Skendros, Panagiotis",Eur J Rheumatol,,168

The data used is secondary data using the literature method, namely by studying and reading literature related to the problems that are the object of research, such as books, articles, journals, surveys, news and other documents. The results of the study reveal that the number of Android users in Indonesia is quite high and increasing every year, such as in 2015-2018 an increase of 27%, so it will be effective if used as a learning medium. In addition, this pandemic condition causes the need for the use of Android-based Learning Media to be quite significant. In contrast to the ability of educators in mastery of technology, there are only 40% of educators who are ready for technology because for media creation at this time sufficient technological capabilities are needed, so the use of Android-Based Learning Media is quite low, especially those using Android applications based on Adobe Flash CS6.

390070,COVID-19: biological factors in men's vulnerability,2020,"Non-protocolized fluid administration in critically ill patients, especially those with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), is associated with poor outcomes. Therefore, fluid administration in patients with Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) should be properly guided. Choice of an index to guide fluid management during a pandemic with mass patient admissions carries an additional challenge due to the relatively limited resources. An ideal test for assessment of fluid responsiveness during this pandemic should be accurate in ARDS patients, economic, easy to interpret by junior staff, valid in patients in the prone position and performed with minimal contact with the patient to avoid spread of infection. Patients with COVID-19 ARDS are divided into two phenotypes (L phenotype and H phenotype) according to their lung compliance. Selection of the proper index for fluid responsiveness varies according to the patient phenotype. Heart-lung interaction methods can be used only in patients with L phenotype ARDS. Real-time measures, such a pulse pressure variation, are more appropriate for use during this pandemic compared to ultrasound-derived measures, because contamination of the ultrasound machine can spread infection. Preload challenge tests are suitable for use in all COVID-19 patients. Passive leg raising test is relatively better than mini-fluid challenge test, because it can be repeated without overloading the patient with fluids. Trendelenburg maneuver is a suitable alternative to the passive leg raising test in patients with prone position. If a cardiac output monitor was not available, the response to the passive leg raising test could be traced by measurement of the pulse pressure or the perfusion index. Preload modifying maneuvers, such as tidal volume challenge, can also be used in COVID-19 patients, especially if the patient was in the gray zone of other dynamic tests. However, the preload modifying maneuvers were not extensively evaluated outside the operating room. Selection of the proper test would vary according to the level of healthcare in the country and the load of admissions which might be overwhelming. Evaluation of the volume status should be comprehensive; therefore, the presence of signs of volume overload such as lower limb edema, lung edema, and severe hypoxemia should be considered beside the usual indices for fluid responsiveness.","Hasanin, Ahmed; Mostafa, Maha",J Anesth,,168

394361,Phenotyping COVID-19 Patients by Ventilation Therapy: Data Quality Challenges and Cohort Characterization,2021,"BACKGROUND: Zoonotic coronaviruses have caused several endemic and pandemic situations around the world. SARS caused the first epidemic alert at the beginning of this century, followed by MERS. COVID-19 appeared to be highly contagious, with human-to-human transmission by aerosol droplets, and reached nearly all countries around the world. A plethora of studies were performed, with reports being published within a short period of time by scientists and medical physicians. It has been difficult to find the relevant data to create an overview of the situation according to studies from accumulated findings and reports. In the present study we aimed to perform a comprehensive study in the context of the case fatality ratios (CFRs) of three major human Coronavirus outbreaks which occurred during the first twenty years of 21st century. METHODS: In this study, we performed meta-analyses on SARS, MERS and COVID-19 outbreak events from publicly available records. Study analyses were performed with the help of highly reputable scientific databases such as PubMed, WOS and Scopus to evaluate and present current knowledge on zoonotic coronavirus outbreaks, starting from 2000 to the end of 2020. RESULTS: A total of 250,194 research studies and records were identified with specific keywords and synonyms for the three viruses in order to cover all publications. In the end, 41 records were selected and included after applying several exclusion and inclusion criteria on identified datasets. SARS was found to have a nearly 11% case fatality ratio (CFR), which means the estimated number of deaths as a proportion of confirmed positive cases; Taiwan was the country most affected by the SARS outbreak based on the CFR analysis. MERS had CFRs of 35.8 and 26 in Saudi Arabia during the 2012 and 2015 outbreaks, respectively. COVID-19 resulted in a 2.2 CFR globally, and the USA reported the highest mortality ratio in the world in the end of first year of COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: Some members of the Coronaviridae family can cause highly contagious and devastating infections among humans. Within the last two decades, the whole world has witnessed several deadly emerging infectious diseases, which are most commonly zoonotic in nature. We conclude that pre-existing immunity during the early stages of a pandemic might be important, but case control and management strategies should be improved to decrease CFRs. Finally, we have addressed several concerns in relation to outbreak events in this study.","Berber, Engin; Sumbria, Deepak; Çanakoglu, Nurettin",J Infect Public Health,,168

398866,Advances in epidemic control laws & covid-19 pandemic in India: A medico-legal analysis,2021,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 became a major public health concern in March 2020. Due to the high rate of hospitalizations for COVID-19 in a short time, health care workers and other involved staff are subjected to a large workload and high emotional distress. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to develop a digital tool to provide support resources that might prevent and consider acute stress reactions in health care workers and other support staff due to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The contents of the digital platform were created through an evidence-based review and consensus conference. The website was built using the Google Blogger tool. The Android version of the app was developed in the Java and XML languages using Android Studio version 3.6, and the iOS version was developed in the Swift language using Xcode version 11.5. The app was evaluated externally by the Andalusian Agency for Healthcare Quality. RESULTS: We detected the needs and pressing situations of frontline health care workers, and then, we proposed a serial of recommendations and support resources to address them. These resources were redesigned using the feedback received. A website in three different languages (Spanish, English, and Portuguese) and a mobile app were developed with these contents, and the AppSaludable Quality Seal was granted to the app. A specific self-report scale to measure acute stress and additional tools were included to support the health care workforce. This instrument has been used in several Latin American countries and has been adapted considering cultural differences. The resources section of the website was the most visited with 18,516 out of 68,913 (26.9%) visits, and the ""Self-Report Acute Stress Scale"" was the most visited resource with 6468 out of 18,516 (34.9%) visits. CONCLUSIONS: The Be + against COVID platform (website and app) was developed and launched to offer a pool of recommendations and support resources, which were specifically designed to protect the psychological well-being and the work morale of health care workers.

This study aimed to characterize the prevalence, clinical manifestations, and outcomes of feeding intolerance in critically ill patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We examined 323 adult patients with COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care units (ICUs) of Massachusetts General Hospital between March 11 and June 28, 2020 who received enteral nutrition. Systematic chart review determined prevalence, clinical characteristics, and hospital outcomes (ICU complications, length of stay, and mortality) of feeding intolerance. RESULTS: Feeding intolerance developed in 56% of the patients and most commonly manifested as large gastric residual volumes (83.9%), abdominal distension (67.2%), and vomiting (63.9%). Length of intubation (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.03-1.08), &#8805;1 GI symptom on presentation (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.59-0.97), and severe obesity (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.13-0.66) were independently associated with development of feeding intolerance. Compared to feed-tolerant patients, patients with incident feeding intolerance were significantly more likely to suffer cardiac, renal, hepatic, and hematologic complications during their hospitalization. Feeding intolerance was similarly associated with poor outcomes including longer ICU stay (median [IQR] 21.5 [14-30] vs. 15 [9-22] days, P < 0.001), overall hospitalization time (median [IQR] 30.5 [19-42] vs. 24 [15-35], P < 0.001) and in-hospital mortality (33.9% vs. 16.1%, P < 0.001). Feeding intolerance was independently associated with an increased risk of death (HR 3.32; 95% CI 1.97-5.6).

402469,Policy responses to COVID-19 present a window of opportunity for a paradigm shift in global health policy: An application of the Multiple Streams Framework as a heuristic,2021,"BackgroundCOVID certification has been introduced, yet there are no empirical evaluations of its impact on vaccine uptake. MethodsMirroring an RCT, we designed a synthetic control model comparing six countries (Denmark, Israel, Italy, France, Germany, Switzerland) that introduced certification (May-August 2021), with 20 control countries. Our estimates provide a counterfactual trend estimating what would have happened in virtually identical circumstances if certificates were not introduced. The primary outcome was daily COVID-19 vaccine doses, with supplementary analyses of COVID-19 infections. FindingsCOVID-19 certification led to increased vaccinations 20 days prior to implementation, with a lasting effect up to 40 days after. Countries with lower than average pre-intervention uptake had a more pronounced increase. In France, doses exceeded 25,895 vaccines per million capita (pmc) or in absolute terms, 1,749,589 doses prior to certification and 11,434 pmc after (772,563 doses). There was no effect in countries with higher uptake (Germany) or when introduced during limited supply (Denmark). There was higher uptake for <20 years and 20-29 years. Access restrictions linked to certain settings (nightclubs, events >1,000) were associated with higher uptake <20 years. When extended to broader settings, uptake remained high in the youngest group, but also observed in older age groups. The relationship of the intervention with reported infections was difficult to assess based on available data. InterpretationWe provide the first empirical assessment of the relationship between COVID-19 certification and vaccine uptake. Interpretation should recognise additional factors, including age eligibility changes and pandemic trajectories. We provide evidence that certification could increase vaccine uptake. Funding and Competing Interest StatementMCM receives funding from the Leverhulme Trust (Large Centre Grant), European Research Council (835079) and participates in UKs SAGE SPI-B (behavioural insights) committee. The funders had no role in study design, data collection, analysis, interpretation, or writing of the report. Research in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThe introduction of COVID-19 certification or vaccine passports has been linked to lower self-reported vaccine intentions, yet national media and health offices report increases in vaccinations. No empirical studies could be located that had examined the impact of the implementation of mandatory COVID-19 certification on vaccine uptake. Added value of this studyTo our knowledge, this is the first empirical analysis of the relationship of the introduction of COVID-19 certification on vaccine uptake. Implications of all the available evidenceOur study provides the first evidence that mandatory COVID-19 certification restricting access to certain settings can influence vaccine uptake for those groups affected by the intervention. Given higher vaccine complacency in certain groups, such as youth who perceive lower risks of infection, this intervention could be an additional policy lever to increase vaccine uptake and population level immunity. Future studies examining more countries and variation by eligibility criteria and factors beyond age are warranted.","Mills, Melinda C; Ruettenauer, Tobias",,,168

412679,"Introduction: ""COVID-19: Politics, Inequalities, and Pandemic""",2020,"Objectives The triage of trauma patients with potential COVID-19 remains a major challenge given that a significant number of patients may be asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic. This study aimed to compare the specificity and sensitivity of available triage systems for COVID-19 among trauma patients. Furthermore, it aimed to develop a novel triage system for SARS-CoV-2 detection among trauma patients in centers with limited resources. Methods All patients referred to our center from February to May 2020 were enrolled in this prospective study. We evaluated the SARS-CoV-2 triage protocols from the WHO, the Iranian Ministry of Health and Medical Education (MOHME), and the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) for their effectiveness in finding COVID-19 infected individuals among trauma patients. We then used these data to design a stepwise triage protocol to detect COVID-19 positive patients among trauma patients. Results According to our findings, the WHO protocol showed 100% specificity and 13.3% sensitivity. The MOHME protocol had 99% specificity and 23.3% sensitivity. While the ECDC protocol showed 93.3% sensitivity and 89.5% specificity, it did not prioritize patients based on traumatic injuries and unstable conditions. Our stepwise triage protocol, which prioritizes traumatic injuries, had 93.3% sensitivity and 90.3% specificity. Conclusion Our study shows that the triage protocols from the WHO, MOHME and ECDC are not best equipped to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals among trauma patients. In our proposed stepwise triage system, patients are triaged according to their hemodynamic conditions, COVID-19 related clinical states, and COVID-19 related laboratory findings. Our triage model can lead to more accurate and resource-effective management of trauma patients with potential COVID-19 infection.

415341,Evaluation of Mobile Phone Healthcare Applications During the Covid-19 Pandemic,2021,"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak originating in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, coincided with chunyun, the period of mass migration for the annual Spring Festival. To contain its spread, China adopted unprecedented nationwide interventions on January 23 2020. These policies included large-scale quarantine, strict controls on travel and extensive monitoring of suspected cases. However, it is unknown whether these policies have had an impact on the epidemic. We sought to show how these control measures impacted the containment of the epidemic. Methods: We integrated population migration data before and after January 23 and most updated COVID-19 epidemiological data into the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model to derive the epidemic curve. We also used an artificial intelligence (AI) approach, trained on the 2003 SARS data, to predict the epidemic. Results: We found that the epidemic of China should peak by late February, showing gradual decline by end of April. A five-day delay in implementation would have increased epidemic size in mainland China three-fold. Lifting the Hubei quarantine would lead to a second epidemic peak in Hubei province in mid-March and extend the epidemic to late April, a result corroborated by the machine learning prediction. Conclusions: Our dynamic SEIR model was effective in predicting the COVID-19 epidemic peaks and sizes. The implementation of control measures on January 23 2020 was indispensable in reducing the eventual COVID-19 epidemic size.","Yang, Zifeng; Zeng, Zhiqi; Wang, Ke; Wong, Sook-San; Liang, Wenhua; Zanin, Mark; Liu, Peng; Cao, Xudong; Gao, Zhongqiang; Mai, Zhitong; Liang, Jingyi; Liu, Xiaoqing; Li, Shiyue; Li, Yimin; Ye, Feng; Guan, Weijie; Yang, Yifan; Li, Fei; Luo, Shengmei; Xie, Yuqi; Liu, Bin; Wang, Zhoulang; Zhang, Shaobo; Wang, Yaonan; Zhong, Nanshan; He, Jianxing",J.

415342,Evaluation of Mobile Phone Healthcare Applications During the Covid-19 Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: Bacterial and fungal superinfections may complicate the course of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. OBJECTIVES: To identify predictors of superinfections in COVID-19. METHODS: Prospective, observational study including patients with COVID-19 consecutively admitted to the University Hospital of Pisa, Italy, between 4 March and 30 April 2020. Clinical data and outcomes were registered. Superinfection was defined as a bacterial or fungal infection that occurred &#8805;48 h after hospital admission. A multivariate analysis was performed to identify factors independently associated with superinfections. RESULTS: Overall, 315 patients with COVID-19 were hospitalized and 109 episodes of superinfections were documented in 69 (21.9%) patients. The median time from admission to superinfection was 19 days (range 11-29.75). Superinfections were caused by Enterobacterales (44.9%), non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli (15.6%), Gram-positive bacteria (15.6%) and fungi (5.5%). Polymicrobial infections accounted for 18.3%. Predictors of superinfections were: intestinal colonization by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (OR 16.03, 95% CI 6.5-39.5, Pâ<â0.001); invasive mechanical ventilation (OR 5.6, 95% CI 2.4-13.1, Pâ<â0.001); immunomodulatory agents (tocilizumab/baricitinib) (OR 5.09, 95% CI 2.2-11.8, Pâ<â0.001); C-reactive protein on admission >7 mg/dl (OR 3.59, 95% CI 1.7-7.7, Pâ=â0.001); and previous treatment with piperacillin/tazobactam (OR 2.85, 95% CI 1.1-7.2, Pâ=â0.028). Length of hospital stay was longer in patients who developed superinfections ompared with those who did not (30 versus 11 days, Pâ<â0.001), while mortality rates were similar (18.8% versus 23.2%, Pâ=â0.445).

417165,No place to shelter: ethnography of the homeless population in the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"The emergence of COVID-19 across the globe prompted many countries to institute total lockdown or other models of mobility restrictions to mitigate the spread of the disease. On March 29th, Nigeria instituted a nationwide lockdown. It is pertinent to understand the pattern created by this lockdown. This could offer insights into how people perceive the hazard and the level of compliance across the States in Nigeria. Mobile phone-based mobility data and the number of new cases from the beginning to the end of the lockdown were utilised. The study examines space-time trends across different place categories at the state level. Place categories witnessed mobility reduction as high as 56%, 57%, 65%, 75%, 38% for retail and recreation (RtRc), Grocery and Pharmacy (GrPh), Park, and Transport Hubs (Trst) respectively. Most States recorded mobility uptrend towards workplace, retail and recreational areas. Multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) identified two dimensions from the Space-time trends. The first dimension (D1) accounted for 66% of the variance. Examination of the Object Scores from the MCA showed that there are two classes-two risk perception groups. The pattern of mobility recorded shows that there is a variation in mobility restriction compliance across the States. The trend groupings identified captured an aspect of risk perception within each State. Thus, pointing to difference in levels of risk acceptance. With the level of misinformation currently being experienced worldwide, concerted efforts should be made on improving risk perception to prevent the re-emergence of the disease.","Lawal, Olanrewaju; Nwegbu, Chidozie",GeoJournal,,168
417364,Effects of COVID-19-related stay-at-home order on neuropsychophysiological response to urban spaces: Beneficial role of exposure to nature?,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Efficient evaluation with an early surrogate endpoint, taking into account the process of disease evolution, may not only clarify inconsistent or underpowered results but also provide a new insight into the exploration of a new antiviral therapy for treating COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We assessed the dynamics of COVID-19 disease spectrum, commencing from low-risk (no or low oxygen supplement), medium-risk (non-invasive ventilator or high oxygen supplement), and high-risk (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or invasive ventilator) risk state on enrollment, and then the subsequent progression and regression of risk states until discharge or death. The efficacy of antiviral therapy in altering the dynamics was assessed by using the high-risk state as a surrogate endpoint based on the data retrieved from the two-arm Adaptive Covid-19 Treatment Trial. RESULTS: Using the high-risk state as a surrogate endpoint, remdesivir treatment led to a decrease in the high-risk COVID-19 state by 34.8% (95% CI 26.7-42.0%) for a 14-day period and 29.3% (95% CI 28.8-29.8%) up to 28 days, which were consistent with a statistically significant reduction of death by 30.5% (95% CI 6.6, 50.9%) up to a 28-day period. The estimates of numbers needed to be treated were 100.9 (95% CI 88.1, 115.7) for using the high-risk COVID-19 state as a surrogate endpoint for a 14-day period and 133.3 (95% CI 112.5, 158.0) were required for averting one death from COVID-19 up to 28 days. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the expedient use of the high-risk COVID-19 disease status as a surrogate endpoint for evaluating the primary outcome of the earliest death.","Jen, Hsiao-Hsuan; Chang, Wei-Jung; Lin, Ting-Yu; Hsu, Chen-Yang; Yen, Amy Ming-Fang; Lai, Chao-Chih; Chen, Tony Hsiu-Hsi",,,168

The SARS-CoV-2 virus might lead to characteristic patterns in the results of widely available, routine blood tests that could be identified with machine learning methodologies. Machine learning modalities integrating findings from these common laboratory test results might accelerate ruling out COVID-19 in emergency department patients. OBJECTIVE: We sought to develop (ie, train and internally validate with cross-validation techniques) and externally validate a machine learning model to rule out COVID 19 using only routine blood tests among adults in emergency departments. METHODS: Using clinical data from emergency departments (EDs) from 66 US hospitals before the pandemic (before the end of December 2019) or during the pandemic (March-July 2020), we included patients aged &#8805;20 years in the study time frame. We excluded those with missing laboratory results. Model training used 2183 PCR-confirmed cases from 43 hospitals during the pandemic; negative controls were 10,000 prepandemic patients from the same hospitals. External validation used 23 hospitals with 1020 PCR-confirmed cases and 171,734 prepandemic negative controls. The main outcome was COVID 19 status predicted using same-day routine laboratory results. Model performance was assessed with area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve as well as sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value (NPV). RESULTS: Of 192,779 patients included in the training, external validation, and sensitivity data sets (median age decile 50 [IQR 30-60] years, 40.5% male [78,249/192,779]), AUROC for training and external validation was 0.91 (95% CI 0.90-0.92). Using a risk score cutoff of 1.0 (out of 100) in the external validation data set, the model achieved sensitivity of 95.9% and specificity of 41.7%; with a cutoff of 2.0, sensitivity was 92.6% and specificity was 59.9%. At the cutoff of 2.0, the NPVs at a prevalence of 1%, 10%, and 20% were 99.9%, 98.6%, and 97%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A machine learning model developed with multicenter clinical data integrating commonly collected ED laboratory data demonstrated high rule-out accuracy for COVID-19 status, and might inform selective use of PCR-based testing.","Plante, Timothy B; Blau, Aaron M; Berg, Adrian N; Weinberg, Aaron S; Jun, Ik C; Tapson, Victor F; Kanigan, Tanya S; Adib, Artur B",J Med Internet Res,,168

419082,Lessons learned from coronavirus pandemic,2020,"Background: Asthma affects up to 33% of children in Latin American settings. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on access to and use of health services. We aimed to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on asthma exacerbations, medical facility visits, and use of asthma medications in children. Methods: We used data from a prospective cohort of 213 children aged 5–17 years in 3 Ecuadorian cities and analysed the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on asthma. Outcomes (asthma exacerbations, emergency room [ER] visits, planned and unplanned outpatient visits, and use of inhaled corticosteroids and Beta-2 agonists) were analysed using repeated Poisson counts (ie, number of events per participant before and during the COVID-19 lockdown). Results: During compared to before lockdown: a) the number of asthma exacerbations remained constant (IRR, 0.87;95% CI: 0.72–1.05;p = 0.152);b) outpatient visits (IRR 0.26, 95% CI 0.14–0.47, p &lt; 0.001) declined 74% while ER visits declined 89% (IRR 0.11, 95% CI 0.04–0.32, p &lt; 0.001);and c) there was no change in inhaled corticosteroids use (IRR 1.03, 95% CI 0.90–1.16, P = 0.699) while Beta-2 agonist use increased (IRR 1.32, 95% CI 1.10–1.58, P = 0.003). Conclusions: In a cohort of Ecuadorian children with asthma, health services attendance decreased dramatically after COVID-19 lockdown, but asthma exacerbations and use of inhaled corticosteroids were unchanged.

421065,"A national survey of COVID-19 challenges, responses and effects in Australian general practice",2020,"Many studies investigated the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on urban air quality, but their adopted approaches have varied and there is no consensus as to which approach should be used. In this paper we compare three of the main approaches and assess their performance using both estimated and measured data from several air quality monitoring stations (AQMS) in Reading, Berkshire UK. The approaches are: (1) Sequential approach – comparing pre-lockdown and lockdown periods 2020;(2) Parallel approach – comparing 2019 and 2020 for the equivalent time of the lockdown period;and (3) Machine learning modelling approach – predicting pollution levels for the lockdown period using business as usual (BAU) scenario and comparing with the observations. The parallel and machine learning approaches resulted in relative higher reductions and both showed strong correlation (0.97) and less error with each other. The sequential approach showed less reduction in NO and NOx, showed positive gain in PM10 and NO2 at most of the sites and demonstrated weak correlation with the other two approaches, and is not recommended for such analysis. Overall, the sequential approach showed −14, +4, −32, and + 56% change, the parallel approach showed −46, −43, −43 and + 7% change, and the machine learning approach showed −47, −44, −38 and + 5% change in NOx, NO2, NO and PM10 concentrations, respectively. The pollution roses demonstrated that the UK received easterly polluted winds from the central and eastern Europe, promoting secondary particulates and O3 formation during the lockdown. Changes in pollutant concentrations vary both in space and time according to the approach used, environment type of the monitoring site and the data type (e.g., deweathered vs. raw data).

421066,"A national survey of COVID-19 challenges, responses and effects in Australian general practice",2020,"In the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic situation, exposure assessment and control strategies for aerosol transmission path are feebly understood. A recent study pointed out that Poissonian fluctuations in viral loading of airborne droplets significantly modifies the size spectrum of the virus-laden droplets (termed as ""virusol"") (Anand and Mayya, 2020). Herein we develop the theory of residence time of the virusols, as contrasted with complete droplet system in indoor air using a comprehensive ""Falling-to-Mixing-Plate-out"" model that considers all the important processes namely, indoor dispersion of the emitted puff, droplet evaporation, gravitational settling, and plate out mechanisms at indoor surfaces. This model fills the existing gap between Wells falling drop model (Wells, 1934) and the stirred chamber models (Lai and Nazarofff, 2000). The analytical solutions are obtained for both 1-D and 3-D problems for non-evaporating falling droplets, used mainly for benchmarking the numerical formulation. The effect of various parameters is examined in detail. Significantly, the mean residence time of virusols is found to increase nonlinearly with the viral load in the ejecta, ranging from about 100 to 150 s at low viral loads (<104 /ml) to about 1100-1250 s at high viral loads (>1011 /ml). The implications are discussed.","Srinivasan, Anand; Krishan, Jayant; Bathula, Sreekanth; Mayya, Yelia S",Indoor air,,168
422029,The Pandemic Challenge: Reflections on the Social Justice Dynamic,2020,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The coronavirus outbreak significantly changed the need of healthcare services. We hypothesized that the COVID-19 pandemic decreased the frequency of pediatric fracture operations. We also hypothesized that the frequency of emergency pediatric surgical operations decreased as well, as a result of patient-related reasons, such as neglecting or underestimating the symptoms, to avoid hospital admission. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nationwide data were individually collected and analyzed in all five tertiary pediatric surgical/trauma centers in Finland. Operations related to fractures, appendicitis, and acute scrotum in children aged above 16 years between March 1 and May 31 from 2017 to 2020 were identified. The monthly frequencies of operations and type of traumas were compared between prepandemic 3 years and 2020. RESULTS: Altogether, 1755 patients were identified in five tertiary hospitals who had an emergency operation during the investigation period. There was a significant decrease (31%, p = 0.03) in trauma operations. It was mostly due to reduction in lower limb trauma operations (32%, p = 0.006). Daycare, school, and organized sports-related injuries decreased significantly during the pandemic. These reductions were observed in March and in April. The frequencies of appendectomies and scrotal explorations remained constant. CONCLUSION: According to the postulation, a great decrease in the need of trauma operations was observed during the peak of COVID-19 pandemic. In the future, in case similar public restrictions are ordered, the spared resources could be deployed to other clinical areas. However, the need of pediatric surgical emergencies held stable during the COVID-19 restrictions.","Raitio, A; Ahonen, M; Jääskelä, M; Jalkanen, J; Luoto, T T; Haara, M; Nietosvaara, Y; Salonen, A; Pakkasjärvi, N; Laaksonen, T; Sinikumpu, J J; Syvänen, J",Scand J Surg,,168

Such a viewpoint requires careful reconsideration, thanks to elegant experiments and novel theoretical approaches that have come about in recent years. In this work, we perform a detailed classical and quantum dynamical study of a model two degree of freedom Hamiltonian, which captures the essence of the debate regarding the dominance of a concerted or a stepwise reaction mechanism. We show that the ultrafast shift of the mechanism from a concerted to a stepwise one is essentially a classical dynamical effect. In addition, due to the classical phase space being a mixture of regular and chaotic dynamics, it is possible to have a rich variety of dynamical behaviour, including a Murrell-Laidler type of mechanism, even at energies sufficiently above that of the index-2 saddle. We rationalize the dynamical results using an explicit construction of the classical invariant manifolds in the phase space.","Pandey, Priyanka; Naik, Shibabrat; Keshavamurthy, Srihari",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.07716v1.pdf,168

428441,Emerging fiscal health and governance concerns resulting from COVID-19 challenges,2020,"Predicting water contamination by statistical models is a useful tool to manage health risk in recreational beaches. Extreme contamination events, i.e. those exceeding normative are generally rare with respect to bathing conditions and thus the data is said to be imbalanced. Modeling and predicting those rare events present unique challenges. Here we introduce and evaluate several machine learning techniques and metrics to model imbalanced data and evaluate model performance. We do so by using a) simulated data-sets and b) a real data base with records of faecal coliform abundance monitored for 10 years in 21 recreational beaches in Uruguay (N &#8776; 19000) using in situ and meteorological variables. We discuss advantages and disadvantages of the methods and provide a simple guide to perform models for a general audience. We also provide R codes to reproduce model fitting and testing. We found that most Machine Learning techniques are sensitive to imbalance and require specific data pre-treatment (e.g. upsampling) to improve performance. Accuracy (i.e. correctly classified cases over total cases) is not adequate to evaluate model performance on imbalanced data set. Instead, true positive rates (TPR) and false positive rates (FPR) are recommended. Among the 52 possible candidate algorithms tested, the stratified Random forest presented the better performance improving TPR in 50% with respect to baseline (0.4) and outperformed baseline in the evaluated metrics. Support vector machines combined with upsampling method or synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) performed well, similar to Adaboost with SMOTE. These results suggests that combining modeling strategies is necessary to improve our capacity to anticipate water contamination and avoid health risk.","Bourel, Mathias; Segura, Angel M; Crisci, Carolina; López, Guzmán; Sampognaro, Lia; Vidal, Victoria; Kruk, Carla; Piccini, Claudia; Perera, Gonzalo",Water Res,,168

Selenium (Se) is an essential trace element for the human body with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and immune effects, and Se deficiency increases RNA-virus replication and virulent mutations, which lead to more severe tissue damage and symptoms. Low Se status in the host may be an important cause of health complications induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In this article, we describe the metabolic mechanisms by which Se is involved in anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and immune effects, and review the role and clinical effects of Se in viral infection. We then discuss the potential relationship between Se and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The association between soil Se level and the incidence of COVID-19 was observed in different cities of Hubei Province. The incidence of COVID-19 was more than 10 times lower in Se-enriched cities (Enshi, Shiyan, and Xiangyang) than in Se-deficient cities (Suizhou and Xiaogan). Although the relationship between soil Se levels and the incidence of COVID-19 in Hubei still needs further study, these findings provide baseline information demonstrating the effect of Se levels on SARS-CoV-2, which could contribute to the prevention and management of COVID-19.","Liu, Qiyuan; Zhao, Xiaoli; Ma, Jin; Mu, Yunsong; Wang, Ying; Yang, Shuhui; Wu, Yihang; Wu, Fengchang; Zhou, Yongzhang",Environ Res,,168

440824,Back to school: Safe for children with underlying medical conditions,2020,"In the year 2019, the potent zoonotic virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) began to rage globally, which resulted in the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring it as a pandemic on March 11th, 2020. Although extensive research is currently ongoing worldwide to understand the molecular mechanism and disease pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2, there are still many nuances to elucidate. Therefore, developing an appropriate vaccine or therapeutic drug to combat coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is exceedingly challenging. Such scenarios require multifaceted approaches to identify suitable contenders for drugs against COVID-19. In this context, investigating natural compounds found in food, spices, and beverages can lead to the discovery of lead molecules that could be repurposed to treat COVID-19. Sixteen cucurbitacin analogues were investigated for activity against the SARS-CoV-2 main protease protein (Mpro), angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding receptor, nonstructural protein 12 (NSP12) RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), NSP13 helicase, and Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway using several relevant tools and simulated screening methods. All key proteins were found to bind efficiently only with cucurbitacin G 2-glucoside and cucurbitacin H with the lowest global energy. Further, the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) of all the cucurbitacins were analysed to explore their drug profiles. Cucurbitacin G 2-glucoside and H showed the best hits and all the analogues showed no adverse properties that would diminish their drug-likeness abilities. The encouraging results of the current study may lay the foundation for future research and development of effective measures and preventive medications against SARS-CoV-2.","Kapoor, Neha; Ghorai, Soma Mondal; Kushwaha, Prem Kumar; Shukla, Richa; Aggarwal, Charu; Bandichhor, Rakeshwar",Inform Med Unlocked,,168

The primary endpoint was time to initial treatment failure (TF), defined as HbA1c &#8805;7.0% at two consecutive scheduled visits after randomisation. The time to secondary TF was assessed when both groups were receiving and failing on the combination. A total of 186 (9.3%) patients had YOD and 1815 (90.7%) had LOD with a mean age difference of 20.4 years. Compared with metformin monotherapy, early combination reduced the risk of time to initial TF for both YOD (48%, p < 0.0006) and LOD (46%, p < 0.0001). With early combination, risk for time to secondary TF was reduced by 48% (p < 0.0035) in YOD and 24% (p < 0.0009) in LOD. Both treatment approaches were well-tolerated with no unexpected safety concerns. In treatment-naïve patients with YOD (HbA1c 6.5-7.5%), early combination strategy improved attainment of glycaemic target with durability and delayed treatment escalation compared with initial metformin monotherapy.

458045,Increased paediatric screen time during pandemic: A cause of concern to child health,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak on neurology resident training in Italy. METHOD: We created a web-based survey regarding changes in clinical, research, and educational activity of neurology trainees in Italy during the COVID-19 pandemic and the preventive measures undertaken by local institutions to reduce the risk of contagion. RESULTS: Seventy-nine residents working in Italy completed the survey. A total of 87.3% of trainees reported a substantial reduction in their neurologic duties since COVID-19 appeared in Italy, and 17.8% were also recruited or volunteered for COVID-19-dedicated wards. Likewise, more than 60% of trainees experienced a reduction or interruption in research activity. As regards the perceived effect of the COVID-19 outbreak on their neurologic training, almost 70% of surveyed trainees believe that the COVID-19 pandemic had or will have a negative effect on their formation as neurologists, for different reasons. Furthermore, trainees reported a consistent exposure (69.6%) to confirmed positive COVID-19 cases at work, with divergent surveillance and preventive measures taken by local institutions. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the survey shows that the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy has had a subjective negative effect on neurology residents on didactics, clinical, and research training as well as training abroad. The COVID-19 outbreak poses many challenges to academic institutions and training programs, and addressing these issues promptly is crucial to ensure continued quality of trainees' neurologic education. Sharing solutions and ideas among the international neurologic community might help neurology training programs worldwide to better counteract these problems.","Abati, Elena; Costamagna, Gianluca",Neurology,,168

In this context, advanced artificial intelligence techniques are brought to the forefront as a response to the ongoing fight toward reducing the impact of this global health crisis. In this study, potential use-cases of intelligent speech analysis for COVID-19 identification are being developed. By analyzing speech recordings from COVID-19 positive and negative patients, we constructed audio- and symptomatic-based models to automatically categorize the health state of patients, whether they are COVID-19 positive or not. For this purpose, many acoustic features were established, and various machine learning algorithms are being utilized. Experiments show that an average accuracy of 80% was obtained estimating COVID-19 positive or negative, derived from multiple cough and vowel /a/ recordings, and an average accuracy of 83% was obtained estimating COVID-19 positive or negative patients by evaluating six symptomatic questions. We hope that this study can foster an extremely fast, low-cost, and convenient way to automatically detect the COVID-19 disease.","Shimon, Carmi; Shafat, Gabi; Dangoor, Inbal; Ben-Shitrit, Asher",J Acoust Soc Am,,168
464271,Prevalence of depression in college students during covid-19 pandemic,2020,"Many countries are now experiencing the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic straining the healthcare resources with an acute shortage of hospital beds and ventilators for the critically ill patients. This situation is especially worse in India with the second largest load of COVID-19 cases and a relatively resource-scarce medical infrastructure. Therefore, it becomes essential to triage the patients based on the severity of their disease and devote resources towards critically ill patients. Yan et al. 1 have published a very pertinent research that uses Machine learning (ML) methods to predict the outcome of COVID-19 patients based on their clinical parameters at the day of admission. They used the XGBoost algorithm, a type of ensemble model, to build the mortality prediction model. The final classifier is built through the sequential addition of multiple weak classifiers. The clinically operable decision rule was obtained from a 'single-tree XGBoost' and used lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), lymphocyte and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) values. This decision tree achieved a 100% survival prediction and 81% mortality prediction. However, these models have several technical challenges and do not provide an out of the box solution that can be deployed for other populations as has been reported in the""Matters Arising""section of Yan et al. Here, we show the limitations of this model by deploying it on one of the largest datasets of COVID-19 patients containing detailed clinical parameters collected from India.","Makhija, Yukti; Bhatia, Samarth; Singh, Shalendra; Jayaswal, Sneha Kumar; Malik, Prabhat Singh; Gupta, Pallavi; Samaga, Shreyas N.; Johri, Shreya; Venigalla, Sri Krishna; Hota, Rabi Narayan; Bhatia, Surinder Singh; Delhi, Ishaan Gupta Indian Institute of Technology; Pune, Armed forces Medical College; Delhi, All India Institute of Medical Sciences; Education, Indian institute of Science; Bhopal, Research; Delhi, DGAFMS office Ministry of Defence",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07215v1.pdf,168

467065,The Treatment of Disability Under Crisis Standards of Care: An Empirical and Normative Analysis of Change Over Time During COVID-19,2021,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Patients with tracheostomies have an anatomically altered connection between their upper and lower airways that could impact SARS-CoV-2 testing. Our goal was to evaluate for discordance in SARS-CoV-2 detection in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and tracheostomies based on the site analyzed. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review METHODS: This single-institution study evaluated hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who had tracheostomies placed during their treatment. We analyzed SARS-CoV-2 RNA nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) results after tracheostomy. All included patients had nasopharyngeal (NP) and tracheal (TR) samples taken within a 48-hour period, allowing us to characterize rate of test concordance. RESULTS: Forty-five patients met our inclusion criteria. Thirty-two (71.1%) patients had entirely concordant results after tracheostomy. However, 13 (28.9%) patients had at least one set of discordant results, the majority of which were NP negative and TR positive. There were no statistically significant differences in demographic or clinical variables, including time to tracheostomy and time to testing, among patients with concordant versus discordant SARS-CoV-2 results. CONCLUSION: This represents the first study to examine SARS-CoV-2 RNA NAAT concordance between NP and TR sites in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and tracheostomies. One-third of patients demonstrated discordant testing when NP and TR specimens were collected within a 48-hour time period. Thus, patients with tracheostomies may have a higher false-negative rate if only one site is assessed for SARS-CoV-2. We recommend analyzing samples from both the nasopharynx and trachea for these patients until more prospective data exist.

Here we used the Delta variant to challenge hamsters innoculated with S-2P based on the ancestral strain or the Beta variant in two-dose or three-dose regimens. Two doses of ancestral S-2P followed by the third dose of Beta variant S-2P was shown to induce the highest neutralizing antibody titer against live SARS-CoV-2 of the ancestral strain as well as all VoCs. All regimens of vaccination were able to protect hamsters from SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant challenge and reduce lung live virus titer. Three doses of vaccination significantly reduced lung viral RNA titer, regardless of using the ancestral or Beta variant S-2P as the third dose. Based on the immunogenicity and viral challenge data, two doses of ancestral S-2P followed by the third dose of Beta variant S-2P could induce broad and potent immune response against the variants.","Kuo, Tsun-Yung; Lien, Chia-En; Lin, Yi-Jiun; Lin, Meei-Yun; Wu, Chung-Chin; Tang, Wei-Hsuan; Chuang, Ya-Shan; Liu, Luke Tzu Chi; Chen, Charles",,,168

The main objective of this study was to measure the prevalence and compare the severity of this psychological distress among four groups of an Iranian population. METHOD: In a cross-sectional survey, the mental health status of four groups of an Iranian society including community population, patients with COVID-19, medical staff, and medical students were investigated by the self-report questionnaire of Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS). DASS-21 questionnaire and the demographic data sheet were filled out by the participants. All statistical analyses were done using R version 3.6.1 software. P-values less than 0.05 were considered as statistically significant. ANOVA test was used to compare the severity of stress, anxiety, and depression between the four study groups. RESULTS: Of the 886 participants in this survey, 554 (62.5%) were men and 332 (37.5%) were women, and the mean ± standard division of age was 40.91 ± 10.7 years. Among these participants, 241 (27.2%) were selected from community population, 221 (24.9%) were patients with COVID-19, 217 (24.5%) were medical staff, and 207 (23.4%) were medical students. The mean score of stress, anxiety, and depression in medical students and patients with COVID-19 was significantly higher than in medical staff and community population (P < 0.05). Overall, the anxiety score in men was higher than that in women (27.4 ± 4.6 vs. 26.48 ± 4.8, P = 0.006), and unmarried participants had a significantly higher depression score compared with the married group (27.5 ± 4.8 vs. 26.7 ± 4.6, P = 0.023). In addition, the score of depression was higher in female medical staff (27.08 ± 4.6 vs. 25.33 ± 4.3, P = 0.011) and community population (26.6 ± 4.3 vs. 25.3 ± 4.3, P = 0.02) than in male. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients and medical students in contact with these patients were at a high risk for mental illness due to lower experience compared with professional medical staff and community population.

482380,Reflections,2021,"COVID-19 is a novel disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 which has conquered the world rapidly resulting in a pandemic that massively impacts our health, social activities, and economy. It is likely that vaccination is the only way to form ""herd immunity"" and restore the world to normal. Here we developed a vaccine candidate for COVID-19 based on the virus-like particle AP205 displaying the spike receptor binding motif (RBM), which is the major target of neutralizing antibodies in convalescent patients. To this end, we genetically fused the RBM domain of SARS-CoV-2 to the C terminus of AP205 of dimerized capsid proteins. The fused VLPs were expressed in E. coli, which resulted in insoluble aggregates. These aggregates were denatured in 8 M urea followed by refolding, which reconstituted VLP formation as confirmed by electron microscopy analysis. Importantly, immunized mice were able to generate high levels of IgG antibodies recognizing eukaryotically expressed receptor binding domain (RBD) as well as spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, induced antibodies were able to neutralize SARS-CoV-2/ABS/NL20. Additionally, this vaccine candidate has the potential to be produced at large scale for immunization programs.","Liu, X.; Chang, X.; Rothen, D.; Derveni, M.; Krenger, P.; Roongta, S.; Wright, E.; Vogel, M.; Tars, K.; Mohsen, M.

Despite the pleiotropic functions of St18, little is known about its roles in macrophages. Here, we report that myeloid St18 is a potent inhibitor of VEGF-A. Mice lacking St18 in myeloid lineages exhibit increased retinal vasculature with enhanced serum VEGF-A concentrations. Despite the normal activation of NF-&#954;B target genes, these mice are highly susceptible to LPS-induced shock, polymicrobial sepsis, and experimental colitis, accompanied by enhanced vascular and intestinal leakage. Pharmacological inhibition of VEGF signaling rescued the high mortality rate of myeloid-specific St18-deficient mice in response to inflammation. Mechanistically, St18 directly binds to Sp1 and attenuates its activity, leading to the suppression of Sp1 target gene VEGF-A. Using mouse genetic and pharmacological models, we reveal myeloid St18 as a critical septic death protector.","Maruyama, Kenta; Kidoya, Hiroyasu; Takemura, Naoki; Sugisawa, Erika; Takeuchi, Osamu; Kondo, Takeshi; Eid, Mohammed Mansour Abbas; Tanaka, Hiroki; Martino, Mikaël M; Takakura, Nobuyuki; Takayama, Yasunori; Akira, Shizuo; Vandenbon, Alexis; Kumagai, Yutaro",Cell Rep,,168
485538,Live free and die: Expanding the terror management health model for pandemics to account for psychological reactance,2021,"OBJECTIVE: T-cell responses against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are observed in unexposed individuals. We evaluated the impact of this pre-existing cellular response on incident SARS-CoV-2 infections. METHODS: This was a follow-up study of 38 seronegative healthcare workers (HCWs) with previous evaluation of CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell responses after stimulation with SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins. Infection was considered in the presence of a positive RT-PCR test and/or confirmed seroconversion. RESULTS: Twenty of the 38 HCWs included (53%) had a previous specific CD8+ T-cell response to peptides encompassing the spike protein (S) in 13 (34%), the membrane (M) in 17 (45%), or/and the nucleocapsid (N) in three (8%). During a follow-up of 189 days (interquartile range (IQR) 172-195), 11 HCWs (29%) had an RT-PCR-positive test (n = 9) or seroconverted (n = 2). Median duration of symptoms was 2 days (IQR 0-7), and time to negative RT-PCR was 9 days (IQR 4-10). Notably, six incident infections (55%) occurred in HCWs with a pre-existing T-cell response (30% of those with a cellular response), who showed a significantly lower duration of symptoms (three were asymptomatic). Three of the six HCWs having a previous T-cell response continued to test seronegative. All the infected patients developed a robust T-cell response to different structural SARS-CoV-2 proteins, especially to protein S (91%). CONCLUSION: A pre-existing T-cell response does not seem to reduce incident SARS-CoV-2 infections, but it may contribute to asymptomatic or mild disease, rapid viral clearance and differences in seroconversion.","Casado, José L; Häemmerle, Johannes; Vizcarra, Pilar; Velasco, Hector; Velasco, Tamara; Fernandez-Escribano, Marina; Vallejo, Alejandro",Clin Microbiol Infect,,168
489886,Hand hygiene behavior among Sri Lankan medical students during COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected millions of people throughout the world since December 2019. However, there is a limited amount of data about pediatric patients infected with the disease agent, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: The epidemiological, laboratory, radiological, and treatment features of the pediatric patients who were positive for SARS-CoV-2 based on the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test, were investigated retrospectively. RESULTS: The median age of 81 children included in the study was 9.50 years (0-17.75 years). The most frequent symptoms at the time of admission were fever (58%), cough (52%), and fatigue or myalgia (19%). The abnormal laboratory findings in these cases were decreased lymphocytes (2.5%, n = 2), leucopenia (5%, n = 4), and increased lactate dehydrogenase (17.2%, n = 14), C-reactive protein (16%, n = 13), procalcitonin (3.7%, n = 3), and D-dimer (12.3%, n = 10). Three (4%) patients had consolidation in chest computed tomography, and three (4%) had ground-glass opacities. None of the patients needed intensive care except for the newborns. The median time to turn SARS-CoV-2 negative in the RT-PCR test was 5 (3-10) days. The median length of hospital stay was 5 (4-10) days. The time to turn SARS-CoV-2 negative in the RT-PCR test and the length of hospital stay were significantly longer for those aged five years or younger than others (P = 0.037, P = 0.01). CONCLUSION: Compared to adults, COVID-19 is milder and more distinctive in children. As a result, more conservative approaches might be preferred in children for the diagnostic, clinical, and even therapeutic applications.","Korkmaz, Muhammet Furkan; Türe, Esra; Dorum, Bayram Ali; Kiliç, Zeliha Banu",J Korean Med Sci,,168

To date, it is the reason for infections of over 35 lakhs and the death of over 2 lakh human beings. We propose a procedure to detect CoVID-19 affected localities using a sewage mass testing and pooling mechanism which has gained ground in recent times. The proposed method named Sewage Pooling Algorithm tests wastewater samples from sewage systems to pinpoint the regions which are affected by maximum chances of the virus spread. The algorithm also uses a priority-based backtracking procedure to perform testing in sewage links depending on the probability of infection in the sub-areas. For places with very rare CoVID cases, we present a gradient-based search method to prune those areas. The proposed method has less human intervention and increases the effective tests/million people over current in-place methods.","Guha, Ritam; Sengupta, Anik; Dutta, Ankan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.07269v1.pdf,168

Múltiples reportes indican lo peligroso que puede llegar a ser la COVID-19 en pacientes oncológicos. Objetivo: Caracterizar al paciente oncológico y su tratamiento en el marco de la actual pandemia de COVID-19. Material y Métodos: Se realizó una revisión bibliográfica para la cual se usaron 37 referencias bibliográficas en inglés y español para la cual se utilizó Pubmed/Medline, ScIELO, Scopus, ScienceDirect, así como fuentes oficiales como OMS y CDC. Desarrollo: Los pacientes oncológicos presentan un sistema inmune comprometido. La polipnea se presentó más en pacientes con cáncer con diagnostico de la COVID-19 que en aquellos sin antecedentes oncológicos. No se hallaron diferencias en relación con otros síntomas; sin embargo se detectaron lesiones de mayor severidad en la Tomografía Axial Computarizada. En estos pacientes deben reforzarse medidas preventivas y se plantea la posibilidad de retrasar los tratamientos quimioterapéutico y quirúrgico mientras sea posible, aunque debe tenerse en cuenta el riesgo que esto constituye. Todos los pacientes con cáncer deben clasificarse como de alto riesgo y los que contraigan el SARS-CoV-2, recibirán el mismo tratamiento que los pacientes no oncológicos. Conclusiones: Los pacientes oncológicos tienen un mayor riesgo que la población general de padecer formas graves de la COVID-19; de ahí que sea importante adoptar medidas preventivas adecuadas que no se opongan a la aplicación de un tratamiento oncológicamente adecuado; por tanto se hace necesario adaptar los esquemas previamente establecidos a la situación que vive el mundo actualmente.","Suárez Rodríguez, Claudia; Collado Falcón, Juan Carlos",Rev. habanera cienc. méd,,168

506032,One medical school's experience of sustaining general practice teaching in the time of COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: The numbers of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) deaths per million people differ widely across countries. Often, the causal effects of interventions taken by authorities are unjustifiably concluded based on the comparison of pure mortalities in countries where interventions consisting different strategies have been taken. Moreover, the possible effects of other factors are only rarely considered. METHODS: We used data from open databases (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, World Bank Open Data, The BCG World Atlas) and publications to develop a model that could largely explain the differences in cumulative mortality between countries using non-interventional (mostly socio-demographic) factors. RESULTS: Statistically significant associations with the logarithmic COVID-19 mortality were found with the following: proportion of people aged 80 years and above, population density, proportion of urban population, gross domestic product, number of hospital beds per population, average temperature in March and incidence of tuberculosis. The final model could explain 67% of the variability. This finding could also be interpreted as follows: less than a third of the variability in logarithmic mortality differences could be modified by diverse non-pharmaceutical interventions ranging from case isolation to comprehensive measures, constituting case isolation, social distancing of the entire population and closure of schools and borders. CONCLUSIONS: In particular countries, the number of people who will die from COVID-19 is largely given by factors that cannot be drastically changed as an immediate reaction to the pandemic and authorities should focus on modifiable variables, e.g. the number of hospital beds.","Hradsky, Ondrej; Komarek, Arnost",Eur J Public Health,,168
506132,"The Novel Coronavirus Originating in Wuhan, China;Challenges for Global Health Governance: The Journal of the American Medical Association",2020,"Introduction: The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to a range of emergency measures worldwide. Early in the pandemic, children were suspected to act as drivers of the COVID-19 spread in the population, which was based on experiences with influenza virus and other respiratory pathogens. Consequently, closures of schools and kindergartens were implemented in many countries around the world, alongside with other non-pharmaceutical interventions for transmission control. Given the grave and multifaceted consequences of contact restriction measures for children, it is crucial to better understand the effect size of these incisive actions for the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, we systematically review the current evidence on transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to and by children. Data Sources: PubMed and preprints uploaded on medRxiv. Study Selection: Original research articles, case reports, brief communications, and commentaries were included into the analysis. Each title or abstract was independently reviewed to identify relevant articles. Studies in other languages than English were not included. Data Extraction: Two reviewers independently reviewed the selected studies. Extracted data included citation of each study, type of healthcare setting, location of the study, characteristics of patient population, and reported outcomes. Results: Data on transmission of SARS-CoV-2 on or by children is scarce. Several studies show a lower seropositivity of children compared to adults, suggesting a lower susceptibility of especially younger children. Most insight currently comes from household studies suggesting, that children are predominantly infected by their household contacts. The contagiousness however, seems to be comparable between children and adults, based on our meta-analysis of included studies. Conclusions: Larger and systematic studies are urgently needed to better understand the age dependent patterns of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and thereby design more effective non-pharmaceutical interventions to reduce disease transmission.","Spielberger, B.

We aimed to obtain a clear homeopathic clinical picture of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and postulate the genus epidemicus of the disease in order to inform and enhance future treatment and prophylaxis options. METHODS: We conducted a prospective case series study, collecting data from 19 homeopaths in Catalonia, Spain, from patients who presented with fever and/or cough and/or breathlessness and/or confirmed COVID-19 infection or close contact with a confirmed case. We included 107 patients, and data were recorded through a checklist questionnaire on the day of the case analysis and at day 10-15 after commencing treatment. Symptoms were collected and analyzed with the help of homeopathic repertories. RESULTS: A total of 103 cases were mild or moderate; four were severe. The severe cases were excluded from the analysis and the 103 mild and moderate cases were analyzed and a clear overall clinical picture with mental, general, and particular symptoms was achieved. Eighty-eight cases had a complete recorded follow-up. The most prescribed medicines were Bry, Ars, Phos and Gels, whilst those with the best rates of good response were Sulph, Puls and Bry. Time to full recovery after homeopathic treatment ranged from 3.5 to 14.4 days, depending on the medicine used. The potency 200c was associated with faster rates of full recovery and a lesser need to change remedy. CONCLUSION: We have defined the symptomatic homeopathic characteristics of mild and moderate COVID-19 in Spain and established a set of medicines that might be useful to consider as effective genus epidemicus.","Clapers, Marc Lluís; Velat, Manuela; Clapers, Josep Maria; Vidal-Jové, Joan; Mora, Joan",Homeopathy,,168

This short report is a narrative review of our tertiary paediatric emergency department (ED) perspective and experience managing the evolving outbreak situation. Logistic considerations included the segregation of the ED into physically separate high-risk, intermediate-risk and low-risk areas, with risk-adapted use of personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare personnel in each ED area. Workflow considerations included the progressive introduction of outpatient COVID-19 testing in the ED for enhanced surveillance; adapting the admissions process particularly for high-risk and intermediate-risk cases; and the management of unwell accompanying adult caregivers. Manpower considerations included the reorganisation of medical manpower into modular teams to mitigate the risk of hospital transmission of COVID-19. Future plans for a tiered isolation facility should include structural modifications for the permanent isolation facility such as anterooms for PPE donning/doffing; replication of key ED functions in the tent facility such as a separate resuscitation room and portable X-ray room; and refresher PPE training. Dynamic reassessment of ED workflow processes, in conjunction with the hospital and national public health response, may help in managing this novel disease entity.","Tan, Ronald Ming Ren; Ong, Gene Yong-Kwang; Chong, Shu-Ling; Ganapathy, Sashikumar; Tyebally, Arif; Lee, Khai Pin",Emerg Med J,,168
507604,Twin public health emergencies: Covid-19 and domestic violence,2020,"In this paper, we discuss an explicit model function that can estimate the total number of deaths in the population, and particularly, estimate the cumulative number of deaths in the United States due to the current Covid-19 virus. We compare the modeling results to two related existing models based on a new criteria and several existing criteria for model selection. The results show the proposed model fits significantly better than the other two related models based on the U.S. Covid-19 death data. We observe that the errors of the fitted data and the predicted data points on the total number of deaths in the U.S. on the last available data point and the next coming day are less than 0.5% and 2.0%, respectively. The results show very encouraging predictability for the model. The new model predicts that the maximum total number of deaths will be approximately 62,100 across the United States due to the Covid-19 virus, and with a 95% confidence that the expected total death toll will be between 60,951 and 63,249 deaths based on the data until 22 April, 2020. If there is a significant change in the coming days due to various testing strategies, social-distancing policies, the reopening of community strategies, or a stay-home policy, the predicted death tolls will definitely change. Future work can be explored further to apply the proposed model to global Covid-19 death data and to other applications, including human population mortality, the spread of disease, and different topics such as movie reviews in recommender systems.","Pham, Hoang",Mathematics,,168

STUDY DESIGN: Observational retrospective study. METHODS: Actions taken by military practitioners in the Parisian military hospitals, which contained 500 beds, to fight COVID-19 were listed and described. RESULTS: The Parisian military hospitals were fully reorganized to offer 147% more intensive care unit beds and took care of 665 inpatients with COVID-19 while continuing their core mission of war-wounded military care. A strategy to prioritize the use of medicine and medical devices was designed to avoid shortages. Field intensive care unit deployment and airborne collective medical evacuation by the SSA's MoRPHEE system avoided hospital saturation. CONCLUSIONS: Key facets of this achievement were interunit collaboration, esprit de corps, and health workers' adaptability. Small hospitals can provide a coherent answer to the COVID-19 pandemic, as long as they organize and prioritize the patients' care.","Parisian Military Anti, Covid-Group",Am J Manag Care,,168

513377,Capstone during COVID-19: Medical Device Development at Home to Solve Global Health Problems,2021,"Intro/Background: The death of George Floyd in May 2020 led to increased awareness of longstanding racism and anti-Blackness in the US. In this setting, various medical institutions have released statements condemning racism and injustice in medicine. Critical race theory provides a race-conscious framework with which to examine inequity, power, and justice. CRT has been incorporated into law, political science, sociology, and other fields but, thus far, medicine has failed to formally embrace its teachings. Purpose/Objective: We set out to develop and carry out a Critical Race Theory curriculum to address an identified gap in emergency medicine education. Sessions explored concepts of critical race theory and issues of racism as they relate to the clinical and extraclinical environments. Methods: We developed a series of five virtual workshop sessions in 2019 which were held over Zoom in June and July 2020 in the setting of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. Eight learners completed the curriculum. All sessions were facilitated by the creators of this curriculum, both facilitators have experience guiding workshop discussions related to topics of race. Sessions were held weekly for between 90 to 120 minutes. Outcomes (if available): Surveys identified increased comfort discussing topics of racism, sustained motivation, and increased familiarity with Critical Race Theory among participants. Learners were also more likely to report having a framework for approaching topics of race and racism which is critical for engaging with these and other topics in the future. Summary: We set out to develop and carry out a Critical Race Theory curriculum to address an identified gap in emergency medicine education. Sessions explored concepts of critical race theory and issues of racism as they relate to the clinical and extraclinical environments. We developed a series of five virtual workshop sessions in 2019 which were held over Zoom in June and July 2020 in the setting of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic and were facilitated by the creators of the curriculum. Fifteen incoming emergency medicine interns at the University of California-San Francisco were invited to participate in the curriculum on a voluntary basis. Nine learners showed interest in the curriculum and opted-in to participation. Ultimately, eight learners completed the curriculum. Prior to each session, learners were provided pre-session materials including podcasts, recorded lectures, and readings. Pre-session materials did not exceed 2 hours of work. Thought questions were also provided with pre-session materials to facilitate discussion during sessions. Materials were curated to provide foundational knowledge on Critical Race Theory and US history as well as relate to local history in San Francisco and the Bay Area. Participants universally found our Critical Race Theory curriculum useful and reported increased comfort discussing topics of racism, sustained motivation, and increased familiarity with Critical Race Theory. Opt-in participation contributed to a very engaged cohort of learners and the small group size encouraged participation by all learners. The virtual format made attendance less burdensome for participants. Semi-structured facilitation allowed participants to guide conversations to their own topics of interest while also addressing specific topics at hand. Independent, guided pre-work allowed participants to gather knowledge at their own pace prior to each session which likely contributed to more full participation.","Diaz, T.; Knight, S.",Academic Emergency Medicine,,168
513628,"Serial Interval and Generation Interval for Imported and Local Infectors, Respectively, Estimated Using Reported Contact-Tracing Data of COVID-19 in China",2020,"The infectious disease COVID-19 occurs as a result of infection with the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirusstrain. Most often, COVID-19 proceeds with signs of an acute respiratory viral infection (ARVI) (fever, cough, body aches);loss of smell, nausea, and shortness of breath are possible. However, in a large percentage of those infected, the course of the disease is asymptomatic. After the virus entry into the body, the immune system begins to produce antibodies specific to this virus (Ig - immunoglobulins) - an important factor in the formation of the immune system's defense against infection. Antibody testing is recommended as an additional method for diagnosing an acute infection or when it is impossible to study smears by amplification of nucleic acids, to identify individuals with an asymptomatic form of infection, to establish the fact of a previous infection, and also to select potential donors of immunocompetent plasma. Determination of antibodies of different classes in the blood is informative evidence of the current or past infectious process and helps to identify the stage of the infection development. More often, the level of antibodies of class M (IgM) and G (IgG) is determined in the blood. The development of the instrument base of express analyzers for monitoring the presence of antibodies to the new coronavirus infection COVID-19 is currently relevant in connection with the emerging and ongoing pandemic. It is possible to use the following systems as test analyzers for immune enzyme medium: ARCHITECT - IgG, Abbott and ELISA-IgM-BEST. For the hardware, an Omron industrial controller and CX-One programming system can be used. The truth table for the formation of signals on the diagnosis of the disease has been developed to obtain logical equations for the operation of the analyzer module. The synthesis of relay-contact circuits has been carried out. The simulation of the module's operation showed satisfactory results. Timely and correct diagnostic measures make it possible to diagnose and assess the severity of the disease as early as possible. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Sereda, T.

Millions of people and businesses have been placed in lockdown where the main aim is to stop the spread of the virus. As an extreme phenomenon, the lockdown has triggered a global economic shock at an alarming pace, conveying sharp recessions for many countries. In the meantime, the lockdowns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have drastically changed energy consumption patterns and reduced CO2 emissions throughout the world. Recent data released by the International Monetary Fund and International Energy Agency for 2020 further forecast that emissions will rebound in 2021. Still, the full impact of COVID-19 in terms of how long the crisis will be and how the consumption pattern of energy and the associated levels of CO2 emissions will be affected are unclear. This review aims to steer policymakers and governments of nations toward a better direction by providing a broad and convincing overview on the observed and likely impacts of the pandemic of COVID-19 on the world economy, world energy demand, and world energy-related CO2 emissions that may well emerge in the next few years. Indeed, given that immediate policy responses are required with equal urgency to address three things-pandemic, economic downturn, and climate crisis.

In an effort to contain the disease, the National Health Service has adopted a digital first approach in UK general practice resulting in a significant shift away from face-to-face consultations. Consequently, more consultations are being completed without obtaining objective recording of vital signs and face-to-face examination. Some regions have formed hot hubs to facilitate the review of suspected COVID-19 cases and keep their practice site 'clean' including the use of doorstep observations in avoiding the risk of face-to-face examination. To support the safe, effective and efficient remote assessment of suspected and confirmed patients with COVID-19, we established a doorstep assessment service to compliment telephone and video consultations. This allows physiological parameters such as temperature, pulse, blood pressure and oxygen saturation to be obtained to guide further triage. Quality improvement methods were used to integrate and optimise the doorstep assessment and measure the improvements made. The introduction of a doorstep assessment service increased the proportion of assessments for patients with suspected COVID-19 in routine care over weeks. At the same time we were able to dramatically reduce face-to-face assessment over a 6-week period by optimising through a range of measures including the introduction of a digital stethoscope. The majority of patients were managed by their own general practitioner following assessment supporting continuity of care. There were no adverse events during the period of observation; no staff absences related to COVID-19. Quality improvement methods have facilitated the successful integration of doorstep assessments into clinical care.","Irving, Greg; Lawson, David; Tinsley, Adele; Parr, Helen; Whittaker, Cheryl; Jones, Hayley; Cox, Stephen",,,168

In this international, multicenter study conducted by the World Alliance Societies of Echocardiography, we aim to determine the clinical and echocardiographic phenotype of acute cardiac disease in COVID-19 patients, to explore phenotypic differences in different geographic regions across the world, and to identify parameters associated with in-hospital mortality. METHODS: We studied 870 patients with acute COVID-19 infection from 13 medical centers in four world regions (Asia, Europe, United States, Latin America) who had undergone transthoracic echocardiograms. Clinical and laboratory data were collected, including patient outcomes. Anonymized echocardiograms were analyzed with automated, machine learning-derived algorithms to calculate left ventricular (LV) volumes, ejection fraction, and LV longitudinal strain (LS). Right-sided echocardiographic parameters that were measured included right ventricular (RV) LS, RV free-wall strain (FWS), and RV basal diameter. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to identify clinical and echocardiographic parameters associated with in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Significant regional differences were noted in terms of patient comorbidities, severity of illness, clinical biomarkers, and LV and RV echocardiographic metrics. Overall in-hospital mortality was 21.6%. Parameters associated with mortality in a multivariate analysis were age (odds ratio [OR] = 1.12 [1.05, 1.22], P = .003), previous lung disease (OR = 7.32 [1.56, 42.2], P = .015), LVLS (OR = 1.18 [1.05, 1.36], P = .012), lactic dehydrogenase (OR = 6.17 [1.74, 28.7], P = .009), and RVFWS (OR = 1.14 [1.04, 1.26], P = .007). CONCLUSIONS: Left ventricular dysfunction is noted in approximately 20% and RV dysfunction in approximately 30% of patients with acute COVID-19 illness and portend a poor prognosis. Age at presentation, previous lung disease, lactic dehydrogenase, LVLS, and RVFWS were independently associated with in-hospital mortality. Regional differences in cardiac phenotype highlight the significant differences in patient acuity as well as echocardiographic utilization in different parts of the world.","Karagodin, Ilya; Carvalho Singulane, Cristiane; Woodward, Gary M; Xie, Mingxing; Tucay, Edwin S; Tude Rodrigues, Ana C; Vasquez-Ortiz, Zuilma Y; Alizadehasl, Azin; Monaghan, Mark J; Ordonez Salazar, Bayardo A; Soulat-Dufour, Laurie; Mostafavi, Atoosa; Moreo, Antonella; Citro, Rodolfo; Narang, Akhil; Wu, Chun; Descamps, Tine; Addetia, Karima; Lang, Roberto M; Asch, Federico M",J.

Additionally, the ability to characterize the CA125 proteoforms expressed by individuals may offer clinical insight. Enrichment of CA125 from malignant ascites may provide a high-quality source of this important ovarian cancer biomarker, but a reliable strategy for such enrichment is currently lacking. Beginning with crude ascites isolated from three individual patients with high grade serous ovarian cancer, we enriched for MUC16 using filtration, ion exchange, and size exclusion chromatography and then performed bottom-up proteomics on the isolated proteins. This approach of enrichment and analysis reveals that the peptides detected via mass spectrometry map to the SEA domain and C-loop regions within the tandem repeat domains of CA125 and that peptide abundance correlates with clinical CA125 counts.","Schuster-Little, Naviya; Fritz-Klaus, Roberta; Etzel, Mark; Patankar, Niharika; Javeri, Saahil; Patankar, Manish S; Whelan, Rebecca J",Analyst,,168

METHODS: A wound ostomy and continence nurse used both the stoma ruler and a linear ruler to assess DET (discoloration, erosion, tissue overgrowth) scores and the height of protrusion above the skin of 10 patients with ileostomies and took photographs. The photographs were presented to five ostomy care nurses for reliability testing. The difference between the two methods was determined using paired Wilcoxon signed ranks test. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: Interrater reliability of the linear versus stoma ruler. RESULTS: The interrater reliabilities of the stoma ruler versus the linear ruler for the domain-area DET score were 0.95 (95% confidence interval, 0.89-0.99) and 0.68 (95% confidence interval, 0.42-0.89), respectively. Only nurse 5 reported a significant difference between the two rulers (z = -2.24, P = .03). CONCLUSIONS: In busy clinical settings, the stoma ruler is easy for ostomy care nurses to use to obtain accurate DET scores and the height of stoma protrusion above the skin.

Simulation using a compartment model is used to provide insight into differences in response to public health interventions. Two case studies of interest from Nizamuddin and Dharavi provide contrasting pictures of the success in curbing spread. METHODS: A cluster analysis of the worst affected districts in India provides insight about the similarities between them. The effects of public health interventions in flattening the curve in their respective states is studied using the individual contact SEIQHRF model, a stochastic individual compartment model which simulates disease prevalence in the susceptible, infected, recovered and fatal compartments. RESULTS: The clustering of hotspot districts provide homogeneous groups that can be discriminated in terms of number of cases and related covariates. The cluster analysis reveal that the distribution of number of COVID-19 hospitals in the districts does not correlate with the distribution of confirmed COVID-19 cases. From the SEIQHRF model for Nizamuddin we observe in the second phase the number of infected individuals had seen a multitudinous increase in the states where Nizamuddin attendees returned, increasing the risk of the disease spread. However, the simulations reveal that implementing administrative interventions, flatten the curve. In Dharavi, through tracing, tracking, testing and treating, massive breakout of COVID-19 was brought under control. CONCLUSIONS: The cluster analysis performed on the districts reveal homogeneous groups of districts that can be ranked based on the burden placed on the healthcare system in terms of number of confirmed cases, population density and number of hospitals dedicated to COVID-19 treatment. The study rounds up with two important case studies on Nizamuddin basti and Dharavi to illustrate the growth curve of COVID-19 in two very densely populated regions in India. In the case of Nizamuddin, the study showed that there was a manifold increase in the risk of infection. In contrast it is seen that there was a rapid decline in the number of cases in Dharavi within a span of about one month.","Sengupta, Pooja; Ganguli, Bhaswati; SenRoy, Sugata; Chatterjee, Aditya",BMC Public Health,,168

590829,The COVID‐19 pandemic: agile versus blundering communication during a worldwide crisis: Important lessons for efficient communication to maintain public trust and ensure public safety,2021-05-25,"Inflammation is an old concept that has started to be considered as an important factor in infection and chronic diseases. The role of leukocytes, the plasmatic components, then of the mediators such as prostaglandins, cytokines, and, in recent decades, of the endothelium has completed the concept of the inflammation process. The function of the endothelium appeared to be crucial as a regulator or the initiator of the inflammatory process. Culture of human endothelial cells and experimental systems made it possible to define the molecular basis of inflammation in vascular diseases, in diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis, vasculitis and thromboembolic complications. Advanced glycation end product receptor (RAGE), present on endothelial cells (ECs) and monocytes, participates in the activation of these cells in inflammatory conditions.

It is essential to design affordable and accessible solutions to distinguish pneumonia caused by COVID-19 from other types of pneumonia. In this work, we propose a reliable approach based on deep transfer learning that requires few computations and converges faster. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework for transfer learning is a potential and effective approach to detect and diagnose types of pneumonia from chest X-ray images with a test accuracy of 94.0%.","Brima, Yusuf; Atemkeng, Marcellin; Tankio Djiokap, Stive; Ebiele, Jaures; Tchakounté, Franklin",Diagnostics (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics11081480; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34441414/,168

596206,Health and economic impact of air pollution in the states of India: the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019,2020-12-27,"BACKGROUND: The unrestricted use of linezolid has been linked to the emergence of linezolid-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (LRSE). We report the effects of combined antibiotic stewardship and infection control measures on the spread of LRSE in an intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: Microbiological data were reviewed to identify all LRSE detected in clinical samples at an ICU in southwest Germany. Quantitative data on the use of antibiotics with Gram-positive coverage were obtained in defined daily doses (DDD) per 100 patient-days (PD). In addition to infection control measures, an antibiotic stewardship intervention was started in May 2019, focusing on linezolid restriction and promoting vancomycin, wherever needed. We compared data from the pre-intervention period (May 2018–April 2019) to the post-intervention period (May 2019–April 2020). Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed to determine the genetic relatedness of LRSE isolates. RESULTS: In the pre-intervention period, LRSE were isolated from 31 patients (17 in blood cultures). The average consumption of linezolid and daptomycin decreased from 7.5 DDD/100 PD and 12.3 DDD/100 PD per month in the pre-intervention period to 2.5 DDD/100 PD and 5.7 DDD/100 PD per month in the post-intervention period (p = 0.0022 and 0.0205), respectively. Conversely, vancomycin consumption increased from 0.2 DDD/100 PD per month to 4.7 DDD/100 PD per month (p < 0.0001). In the post-intervention period, LRSE were detected in 6 patients (4 in blood cultures) (p = 0.0065). WGS revealed the predominance of one single clone. CONCLUSIONS: Complementing infection control measures by targeted antibiotic stewardship interventions was beneficial in containing the spread of LRSE in an ICU.

During analytic listening, in the absence of bodily togetherness and in the presence of heightened anxiety about survival, I turned my attention inwardly towards the interior of my own body and made a spontaneous gesture of doodling. These two moves, mental and bodily, both unintentional and unconventional to my analytic training, restored my psychic aliveness and facilitated the process of analytic holding. I will reflect on this particular experience using Milner's concepts: framed gap and the analyst's concentration of the body, which I further conceptualize as ‘visceral attention’. I consider it as a corporal counterpart of ‘free‐floating attention’. It is my contention that the concept of visceral attention has a wider implication for analytic technique in the ordinary psychoanalytic setting when uncertainty prevails in psychoanalytic treatment and with patients whose predicament is marked by body–mind split. The essay explores an analogy between visceral attention and doodling to hold the analytic process at a non‐verbal level. The blank paper and blank inside of the body stand for the ‘framed gap’, the negative space for a new symbol to emerge.","Kirchkheli, Maia",Br J Psychother,https://doi.org/10.1111/bjp.12642; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34548731/,168

Apart from acute pulmonary syndrome, Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) can increasingly induce chronic conditions. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 triggers de novo type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) linked to age-associated cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancers, and neurodegeneration. Mechanistically, SARS-CoV-2 induces inflammation, possibly through damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) signaling and ‘cytokine storm’, causing insulin resistance and the adiponectin (APN) paradox, a phenomenon linking metabolic dysfunction to chronic disease. Accordingly, preventing the APN paradox by suppressing APN-related inflammatory signaling might prove beneficial. A better understanding could uncover novel therapies for SARS-CoV-2 and its chronic disorders.","Ho, Gilbert; Ali, Alysha; Takamatsu, Yoshiki; Wada, Ryoko; Masliah, Eliezer; Hashimoto, Makoto",Drug Discov Today,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drudis.2021.03.013; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359644621001495?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33775925/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1359644621001495,168

In this study we reveal that the peptidyl prolyl isomerase Cyclophilin A (CypA) is enriched in cancer-derived EVs from a range of haematopoietic malignancies. CypA-enriched blood cancer EVs were taken up by normal monocytes independent of EV surface trypsin-sensitive proteins and potently stimulated pro-inflammatory MMP9 and IL-6 secretion. Further characterisation revealed that CypA is intravesicular, however, it is not present in all EVs derived from the haematopoietic cells, instead, it is predominantly located in high density EVs with a range of 1.15–1.18 g/ml. Furthermore, loss of CypA expression in haematological cancer cells attenuates high density EV-induced pro-inflammatory MMP9 and IL-6 secretion from monocytes. Mechanistically, we reveal that homozygous loss or siRNA knockdown of CypA expression significantly reduced the secretion of EVs in the range of 100–200 nm from blood cancer cells under normal and hypoxic conditions. Overall, this work reveals a novel role for CypA in cancer cell EV biogenesis.","Wu, Yunjie; Brennan, Kieran; Fernández, Alfonso Blanco; Mc Gee, Margaret M.",Transl Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33984826/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tranon.2021.101112,168

MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and twenty consecutive patients admitted to Emergency Department, from March 8, 2020, to April 25, 2020, with suspicious of COVID-19 that underwent Chest CT, were retrospectively analyzed. All patients presented CT findings indicative for interstitial pneumonia. Sixty patients with positive COVID-19 real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and 60 patients with negative COVID-19 RT-PCR were enrolled. CT texture analysis (CTTA) was manually performed using dedicated software by two radiologists in consensus and textural features on filtered and unfiltered images were extracted as follows: mean intensity, standard deviation (SD), entropy, mean of positive pixels (MPP), skewness, and kurtosis. Nonparametric Mann–Whitney test assessed CTTA ability to differentiate positive from negative COVID-19 patients. Diagnostic criteria were obtained from receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: Unfiltered CTTA showed lower values of mean intensity, MPP, and kurtosis in COVID-19 positive patients compared to negative patients (p = 0.041, 0.004, and 0.002, respectively). On filtered images, fine and medium texture scales were significant differentiators; fine texture scale being most significant where COVID-19 positive patients had lower SD (p = 0.004) and MPP (p = 0.004) compared to COVID-19 negative patients. A combination of the significant texture features could identify the patients with positive COVID-19 from negative COVID-19 with a sensitivity of 60% and specificity of 80% (p = 0.001).

Extensive investigation identified that simian retrovirus type 4 (SRV-4) was the causative agent of the disease. SRV-4 had previously been isolated only from cynomolgus macaques in which it is usually asymptomatic. We consider that the SRV-4 crossed the so-called species barrier between cynomolgus and Japanese macaques, leading to extremely severe acute symptoms in the latter. Infectious agents that cross the species barrier occasionally amplify in virulence, which is not observed in the original hosts. In such cases, the new hosts are usually distantly related to the original hosts. However, Japanese macaques are closely related to cynomolgus macaques, and can even hybridize when given the opportunity. This lethal outbreak of a novel pathogen in Japanese macaques highlights the need to modify our expectations about virulence with regards crossing species barriers.","Okamoto, Munehiro; Miyazawa, Takayuki; Morikawa, Shigeru; Ono, Fumiko; Nakamura, Shota; Sato, Eiji; Yoshida, Tomoyuki; Yoshikawa, Rokusuke; Sakai, Kouji; Mizutani, Tetsuya; Nagata, Noriyo; Takano, Jun-ichiro; Okabayashi, Sachi; Hamano, Masataka; Fujimoto, Koji; Nakaya, Takaaki; Iida, Tetsuya; Horii, Toshihiro; Miyabe-Nishiwaki, Takako; Watanabe, Akino; Kaneko, Akihisa; Saito, Akatsuki; Matsui, Atsushi; Hayakawa, Toshiyuki; Suzuki, Juri; Akari, Hirofumi; Matsuzawa, Tetsuro; Hirai, Hirohisa",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/srep08850; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25743183/,168

However, existing antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antimalarial drugs is the only option against SARS-CoV-2, but it may be harmful to patients without more clinical evidence. As an alternative solution, we proposed a newer hypothesis using the selective 10 potent anti-HIV drugs and flavonoid class of phytochemicals from previous reports to use in combination against SARS-CoV-2. Primarily, 10 anti-HIV protease inhibitor drugs and 10 phyto-flavonoids as ligands in molecular docking study against the putative target, the SARS-CoV-2-main protease (M(pro)) ID: 6Y2E), as an essential enzyme in viral genome replication. According to molecular docking and drug-ability scores of each ligand, the anti-HIV drug, the darunavir (with a docking score, −10.25 kcal/mol and drug-likeness rating, 0.60) and the quercetin-3-rhamnoside (with a docking score, −10.90 kcal/mol and drug-likeness rating, 0.82) were selected for further analysis in combined effect.

Submission of genomic data to NCBI GenBank is a requirement prior to publication and plays a critical role in making scientific data publicly available. GenBank currently has automatic prokaryotic and eukaryotic genome annotation pipelines but has no viral annotation pipeline beyond influenza virus. Annotation and submission of viral genome sequence is a non-trivial task, especially for groups that do not routinely interact with GenBank for data submissions. We present Viral Annotation Pipeline and iDentification (VAPiD), a portable and lightweight command-line tool for annotation and GenBank deposition of viral genomes. VAPiD supports annotation of nearly all unsegmented viral genomes. The pipeline has been validated on human immunodeficiency virus, human parainfluenza virus 1-4, human metapneumovirus, human coronaviruses (229E/OC43/NL63/HKU1/SARS/MERS), human enteroviruses/rhinoviruses, measles virus, mumps virus, Hepatitis A-E Virus, Chikungunya virus, dengue virus, and West Nile virus, as well the human polyomaviruses BK/JC/MCV, human adenoviruses, and human papillomaviruses. The program can handle individual or batch submissions of different viruses to GenBank and correctly annotates multiple viruses, including those that contain ribosomal slippage or RNA editing without prior knowledge of the virus to be annotated. VAPiD is programmed in Python and is compatible with Windows, Linux, and Mac OS systems. We have created a portable, lightweight, user-friendly, internet-enabled, open-source, command-line genome annotation and submission package to facilitate virus genome submissions to NCBI GenBank.

METHODS We conducted a multicenter one arm proof of concept interventional study. Patients with Covid-19 disease with moderate-to-severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, elevated C-reactive Protein and need for mechanical ventilation and/or CPAP were enrolled. One to three 250-300 ml unit of hyperimmune plasma (neutralizing antibodies titer [≥]1:160) were administered. Primary outcome was 7-days hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were PaO2/FiO2, laboratory and radiologic changes, as well as weaning from mechanical ventilation and safety. RESULTS The study observed 46 patients from March, 25 to April, 21 2020. Patients were aged 63, 61% male, 30 on CPAP and 7 intubated. PaO2/FiO2 was 128 (SD 47). Symptoms and ARDS duration were 14 (SD 7) and 6 days (SD 3). Three patients (6.5%) died within 7 days. The upper one-sided 90%CI was 13.9%, allowing to reject the null hypothesis of a 15% mortality. PaO2/FiO2 increased by 112 units (95%CI 82 to142) in survivors, the chest radiogram severity decreased in 23% (95%CI 5% to 42%); CRP, Ferritin and LDH decreased by 60, 36 and 20% respectively.

Some results are found by comparing the wisdom concepts in Chinese and Western cultures: Firstly, the early wisdom concepts, both in China and the West, contain the elements of intelligence and virtue. Whereas, from the Enlightenment to the Piagetian school, the western concept of wisdom has then shifted to the role of cognition and knowledge; By contrast, the traditional Chinese wisdom concept has been treating wisdom as a virtue. Modern Chinese and western wisdom psychologists are inclined to accept the wisdom meta-theory of “integration of intelligence and virtue”. Secondly, both Chinese and the Western philosophy advocate using wisdom to solve real-life problems. Western thinkers focus on practical problems in the material world, i.e. reconciling conflicts between people and the world through understanding and changing the environment. However, Chinese philosophers focus on internal spiritual problems, i.e. improving the individual realm to solve the contradictions inside oneself.

The aim of the study was to assess the influence of the confinement situation caused by COVID-19 on the levels of self-perceived health and psychological capital in a sample of workers, as well as to analyze whether exposure to burnout before social isolation would help to explain the levels of health and psychological capital. Methods: Data were collected in a longitudinal design. Time 1 surveys (December 2019) were sent to a sample of 354 Spanish workers while in Time 2 (April 2020) the employees completed 235 questionnaires. Results: Our findings indicate a significant worsening of employees’ health perception (t = −4.13; p < 0.01) and psychological capital (4.10, p < 0.01) levels during mandatory confinement in Spain. Our results also revealed that emotional exhaustion is the only burnout dimension capable of explaining the variance of health while self-efficacy does regarding psychological capital. Conclusion: We conclude a significant reduction in self-perceived health and psychological capital during COVID-19 mandatory confinement, and that burnout acts as a predictor variable in both health and psychological capital variance.","Meseguer de Pedro, Mariano; Fernández-Valera, María Magdalena; García-Izquierdo, Mariano; Soler Sánchez, María Isabel",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33504110/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18031064,168

METHODS: We have retrospectively searched our electronic database and identified 33 pwMS who had a delay in treatment due to COVID-19 pandemics. The following data were extracted: age, sex, multiple sclerosis (MS) phenotype: relapsing-remitting (RRMS) or primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS), disease duration, Expanded Disability Status scale (EDSS), previous disease modifying therapy (DMT), number of ocrelizumab cycles prior to the lockdown, dates of first ocrelizumab infusion, last ocrelizumab infusion prior to the lockdown and delayed ocrelizumab infusion after the lockdown. Flow cytometry results, relapses and EDSS progression prior to the delayed ocrelizumab infusion after the lockdown were extracted. RESULTS: The mean time between two ocrelizumab infusion during the lockdown was 7.72±0.64 (range 6.07 to 8.92) months. The mean time between last ocrelizumab infusion and the lymphocyte sampling prior to post COVID infusion was 6.59±0.95 (range 5.18 to 8.49) months. In this period, none of the studied patients had a relapse. In a multivariable linear regression analysis, time from last ocrelizumab infusion to lymphocyte sampling prior to the next infusion was the only significant predictor for CD19(+) B cells count, when corrected for the number of previous ocrelizumab cycles and MS phenotype (RRMS or PPMS) (B=7.981, 95% C.I. 3.277-12.686, p=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: We have not shown clinical consequences of delaying ocrelizumab due to COVID-19 pandemics.

We aimed to compare arbidol and lopinavir/ritonavir(LPV/r) treatment for patients with COVID-19 with LPV/r only. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we included adults (age≥18years) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 without Invasive ventilation, diagnosed between Jan 17, 2020, and Feb 13, 2020. Patients, diagnosed after Jan 17, 2020, were given oral arbidol and LPV/r in the combination group and oral LPV/r only in the monotherapy group for 5–21 days. The primary endpoint was a negative conversion rate of coronavirus from the date of COVID-19 diagnosis(day7, day14), and assessed whether the pneumonia was progressing or improving by chest CT (day7). RESULTS: We analyzed 16 patients who received oral arbidol and LPV/r in the combination group and 17 who oral LPV/r only in the monotherapy group, and both initiated after diagnosis. Baseline clinical, laboratory, and chest CT characteristics were similar between groups. The SARS-CoV-2 could not be detected for 12(75%) of 16 patients’ nasopharyngeal specimens in the combination group after seven days, compared with 6 (35%) of 17 in the monotherapy group (p < 0·05). After 14 days, 15 (94%) of 16 and 9 (52·9%) of 17, respectively, SARS-CoV-2 could not be detected (p < 0·05). The chest CT scans were improving for 11(69%) of 16 patients in the combination group after seven days, compared with 5(29%) of 17 in the monotherapy group (p < 0·05).

Infection with COVID-19 leads to hospitalizations due to respiratory compromise. Secondary manifestations of this virus should warrant further investigation since little is known about COVID-19 and its role in the cardiac circuit. We present a patient with COVID-19 who developed transient third-degree AV block initially hospitalized for septic shock. The patient presented with mild symptoms and the transient nature of the complete heart block could be a matter of low viral load in his circulation.

624930,Deconstructing and Historicizing Access to Medicines: The Changing Priority of Pharmaceutical Governance in China,2021-01-29,"Histidine-rich proteins 2 and 3 gene (pfhrp2 and pfhrp3) deletions affect the efficacy of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) based on the histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2), compromising the correct identification of the Plasmodium falciparum species. Therefore, molecular surveillance is necessary for the investigation of the actual prevalence of this phenomenon and the extent of the disappearance of these genes in these areas and other South American countries, thus guiding national malaria control programs on the appropriate use of RDTs. This study aimed to evaluate the pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 gene deletion in P. falciparum in endemic areas of the Brazilian Amazon. Aliquots of DNA from the biorepository of the Laboratory of Basic Research in Malaria, Evandro Chagas Institute, with a positive diagnosis for P. falciparum infection as determined by microscopy and molecular assays, were included. Monoinfection was confirmed by nested-polymerase chain reaction assay, and DNA quality was assessed by amplification of the merozoite surface protein-2 gene (msp2). The pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 genes were amplified using primers for the region between exons 1 and 2 and for all extension of exon 2. Aliquots of DNA from 192 P. falciparum isolates were included in the study, with 68.7% (132/192) from the municipality of Cruzeiro do Sul (Acre) and 31.3% (60/192) from Manaus (Amazonas). Of this total, 82.8% (159/192) of the samples were considered of good quality. In the state of Acre, 71.7% (71/99) showed pfhrp2 gene deletion and 94.9% (94/99) showed pfhrp3 gene deletion, while in the state of Amazonas, 100.0% (60/60) of the samples showed pfhrp2 gene deletion and 98.3% (59/60) showed pfhrp3 gene deletion. Moreover, 79.8% (127/159) of isolates displayed gene deletion. Our findings confirm the presence of a parasite population with high frequencies of pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 gene deletions in the Brazilian Amazon region. This suggests reconsidering the use of HRP2-based RDTs in the Acre and Amazonas states and calls attention to the importance of molecular surveillance and mapping of pfhrp2/pfhrp3 deletions in this area and in other locations in the Amazon region to guarantee appropriate patient care, control and ultimately contribute to achieving P. falciparum malaria elimination.","Góes, Leandro; Chamma-Siqueira, Nathália; Peres, José Mário; Nascimento, José Maria; Valle, Suiane; Arcanjo, Ana Ruth; Lacerda, Marcus; Blume, Liana; Póvoa, Marinete; Viana, Giselle",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18010123; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33375379/,168

Liuwei Dihuang pills (LDP), an effective Chinese medicinal formula, has been used to treat DN for more than 1000 years. However, its underlying mechanism of action is still vague. METHODS: Active compounds and corresponding targets of LDP were predicted from the TCMSP database. DN disease targets were extracted from the OMIM, GeneCards, TTD, DisGeNET, and DrugBank databases. Subsequently, the “herbal-compound-target” network and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network were constructed and analyzed via the STRING web platform and Cytoscape software. GO functional and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses were carried out on the Metascape web platform. Molecular docking utilized AutoDock Vina and PyMOL software. RESULTS: 41 active components and 186 corresponding targets of LDP were screened out. 131 common targets of LDP and DN were acquired. Quercetin, kaempferol, beta-sitosterol, diosgenin, and stigmasterol could be defined as five crucial compounds. JUN, MAPK8, AKT1, EGF, TP53, VEGFA, MMP9, MAPK1, and TNF might be the nine key targets. The enrichment analysis showed that common targets were mainly associated with inflammation reaction, oxidative stress, immune regulation, and cell apoptosis. AGE-RAGE and IL-17 were the suggested two significant signal pathways. Molecular docking revealed that the nine key targets could closely bind to their corresponding active compounds. CONCLUSION: The present study fully reveals the multicompound's and multitarget's characteristics of LDP in DN treatment. Furthermore, this study provides valuable evidence for further scientific research of the pharmacological mechanisms and broader clinical application.","Wang, Gaoxiang; Zeng, Lin; Huang, Qian; Lu, Zhaoqi; Sui, Ruiqing; Liu, Deliang; Zeng, Hua; Liu, Xuemei; Chu, Shufang; Kou, Xinhui; Li, Huilin",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34552655/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/7262208,168

The COVID-19 pandemic may have further restricted the access of people with pharmacoresistant epilepsy (PWE) to KDT. Thus, we evaluated the experiences of Brazilian PWE and their caregivers during the first year of the pandemic. METHODS: An online self-assessed survey containing 25 questions was distributed via social media to be answered by PWE treated with KDT or their caregivers through Google Forms from June 2020 to January 2021. Mental health was assessed using the DASS and NDDI-E scales. RESULTS: Fifty adults (>18 yo), of whom 68% were caregivers, answered the survey. During the pandemic, 40% faced adversities in accessing their usual healthcare professionals and 38% in obtaining anti-seizure medication (ASM). Despite these issues, 66% of those on KDT could comply with their treatment. Those struggling to maintain KDT (34%) named these obstacles mainly: diet costs, social isolation, food availability, and carbohydrate craving due to anxiety or stress. An increase in seizure frequency was observed in 26% of participants, positively associated with difficulties in obtaining ASM [X2 (1, Nâ¯=â¯48)â¯=â¯6.55; pâ¯=â¯0.01], but not with KDT compliance issues.

626373,The relationship between cultural tightness–looseness and COVID-19 cases and deaths: a global analysis,2021-01-29,"SARS-CoV-2 is a human pathogen that causes infection in both the upper respiratory tract (URT) and the lower respiratory tract (LRT). The viral kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 infection and how they relate to infectiousness and disease progression are not well understood. Here, we develop data-driven viral dynamic models of SARS-CoV-2 infection in both the URT and LRT. We fit the models to viral load data from patients with likely infection dates known, we estimated that infected individuals with a longer incubation period had lower rates of viral growth, took longer to reach peak viremia in the URT, and had higher chances of presymptomatic transmission. We then developed a model linking viral load to infectiousness. We found that to explain the substantial fraction of transmissions occurring presymptomatically, the infectiousness of a person should depend on a saturating function of the viral load, making the logarithm of the URT viral load a better surrogate of infectiousness than the viral load itself. Comparing the roles of target-cell limitation, the innate immune response, proliferation of target cells and spatial infection in the LRT, we found that spatial dissemination in the lungs is likely to be an important process in sustaining the prolonged high viral loads. Overall, our models provide a quantitative framework for predicting how SARS-CoV-2 within-host dynamics determine infectiousness and represent a step towards quantifying how viral load dynamics and the immune responses determine disease severity.","Ke, R.; Zitzmann, C.; Ribeiro, R.

Many of these centers require patients to report, in-person, on a regular basis for their injectable therapy and/or lab studies. The purpose of our study was to investigate barriers of care that patients receiving treatment for testosterone deficiency may be experiencing in the setting of COVID-19. Methods Our survey was posted on a closed Facebook support page for males currently receiving testosterone treatment and members of the group were invited to participate. The survey asked participants several questions related to how they received their injections, if they've experienced difficulties obtaining their injections due to COVID-19 restrictions, and about their interest in telemedicine services for their care. Results The majority of patients were able to receive their treatment despite barriers enforced by the pandemic. Of the 104 participants, almost half received their testosterone prescriptions from an outpatient clinic dedicated to testosterone replacement, while the other half received their therapy from a PCP, endocrinologist, or urologist. Only 5 patients (4.8%) noted difficulties obtaining their injections during this pandemic, 4 of which received their prescriptions from dedicated testosterone clinics, and the other from a PCP. Nearly 90% of respondents self-administered their testosterone therapy. With regards to telemedicine, 57.8% of patients have utilized the technology in some capacity, however 74.4% said that they would prefer to use telemedicine video services with a urologist or APP with expertise in andrology over in-person services. Conclusions In our survey, the majority of the respondents have been able to receive their injectable testosterone therapy despite the ongoing pandemic. The majority of respondents self-administer their treatments, which may explain the lack of barriers.

Some of these broader consequences include cardiovascular events, exacerbations of chronic underlying conditions, increased susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections, functional decline, and poor pregnancy outcomes, all of which may lead to an increased risk for hospitalization and death. Although it is methodologically difficult to measure these impacts, epidemiological and interventional study designs have evolved over recent decades to better take them into account. Recognizing these broader consequences of influenza virus infection is essential to determine the full burden of influenza among different subpopulations and the value of preventive approaches.

Clustering of adolescents’ health-related behaviors by gender identifies the target groups for intervention and informs the strategies to be implemented for behavioral changes. Methods: Data from 1807 adolescents in grades 7 and 10 in a city in South Korea were used. Health-related behaviors including eating habits, physical activity, hand washing, brushing teeth, drinking alcohol, smoking, and Internet use were examined. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify subgroups of adolescents with regard to their health-related behaviors. Results: A four-class model was the most adequate grouping classification across genders: adolescents with (1) healthy behaviors, (2) neither health-promoting nor health-risk behaviors, (3) good hygiene behaviors, and (4) unhealthy behaviors. The majority of both male and female adolescents were classified into the healthy group. Male adolescents belonging to the healthy group were more likely to engage in vigorous physical activities, while vigorous physical activity was not important for female adolescents. The smallest group was the unhealthy group, regardless of gender; however, the proportion of boys in the unhealthy group was almost twice that of girls. Only female adolescents engaged in excessive Internet use, especially the group with neither health-promoting nor health-risk behaviors.

The disconcerting findings of this study demonstrate the overall failure to recognize the importance of web accessibility or perhaps even the indifference toward accessibility on the part of the PPI community.","Bielefield, Arlene; Liu, Yan Quan; Waimon, Victoria",Univers Access Inf Soc,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10209-021-00831-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34456662/,168
630553,Social media use and social connectedness among adolescents in the United Kingdom: a qualitative exploration of displacement and stimulation,2021-09-24,"OBJECTIVE: Waist circumference (WC) is a widely accepted anthropometric parameter of central obesity. We investigated a fully automated body segmentation algorithm for measuring WC on abdominal computed tomography (CT) in comparison to manual WC measurements (WC-manual) and evaluated the performance of CT-measured WC for identifying overweight/obesity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included consecutive adults who underwent both abdominal CT scans and manual WC measurements at a health check-up between January 2013 and November 2019. Mid-waist WCs were automatically measured on noncontrast axial CT images using a deep learning-based body segmentation algorithm. The associations between CT-measured WC and WC-manual was assessed by Pearson correlation analysis and their agreement was assessed through Bland-Altman analysis. The performance of these WC measurements for identifying overweight/obesity (i.e., body mass index [BMI] ≥25 kg/m(2)) was evaluated using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis. RESULTS: Among 763 subjects whose abdominal CT scans were analyzed using a fully automated body segmentation algorithm, CT-measured WCs were successfully obtained in 757 adults (326 women; mean age, 54.3 years; 64 women and 182 men with overweight/obesity). CT-measured WC was strongly correlated with WC-manual (r = 0.919, p < 0.001), and showed a mean difference of 6.1 cm with limits of agreement between -1.8 cm and 14.0 cm in comparison to WC-manual. For identifying overweight/obesity, CT-measured WC showed excellent performance, with areas under the ROC curve (AUCs) of 0.960 (95% CI, 0.933–0.979) in women and 0.909 (95% CI, 0.878–0.935) in men, which were comparable to WC-manual (AUCs of 0.965 [95% CI, 0.938–0.982] and 0.916 [95% CI, 0.886–0.941]; p = 0.735 and 0.437, respectively). CONCLUSION: CT-measured WC using a fully automated body segmentation algorithm was closely correlated with manually-measured WC. While radiation issue may limit its general use, it can serve as an adjunctive output of abdominal CT scans to identify overweight/obesity.","Joo, Ijin; Kwak, Min-Sun; Park, Dae Hyun; Yoon, Soon Ho",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254704; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34280224/,168

In the present study, we tested how the most important predictors of beliefs in conspiracy theories explain endorsing COVID‐19 and non‐COVID‐19 conspiracy theories and conspiracy mentality. Apart from these three measures of conspiratorial thinking, participants (N = 354) completed several measures of epistemic, existential, and social psychological motives, as well as cognitive processing variables. While many predictors had significant correlations, only three consistently explained conspiratorial beliefs when included in one model: higher spirituality (specifically eco‐awareness factor), higher narcissism, and lower analytical thinking. Compared to the other two conspiratorial measures, predictors less explained belief in COVID‐19 conspiracy theories, but this depended on items' content. We conclude that the same predictors apply to belief in both COVID and non‐COVID conspiracies and identify New Age spirituality as an important contributor to such beliefs.","Gligorić, Vukašin; da Silva, Margarida Moreira; Eker, Selin; van Hoek, Nieke; Nieuwenhuijzen, Ella; Popova, Uljana; Zeighami, Golnar",Appl Cogn Psychol,https://doi.org/10.1002/acp.3844; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34177101/,168

The RTC copies viral RNA for propagation into new virus and for ribosomal transcription of viral proteins. To accomplish these activities the RTC mechanism must also conform to a large number of imperatives including RNA over DNA base recognition, base pairing, distinguishing viral and host RNA, production of mRNA that conforms to host ribosome conventions, interface with error checking machinery and evading host immune responses. In addition, the RTC will discontinuously transcribe specific sections of viral RNA to amplify certain proteins over others. Central to SARS-CoV-2 viability, the RTC is therefore dynamic and sophisticated. We have conducted a systematic structural investigation of three components that make up the RTC: Nsp7, Nsp8 and Nsp12 (also known as RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)). We have solved high resolution crystal structures of the Nsp7/8 complex providing insight into the interaction between the proteins. We have used small angle X-ray and neutron solution scattering (SAXS and SANS) on each component individually as pairs and higher order complexes and with and without RNA. Using size exclusion chromatography and multi-angle light scattering coupled SAXS (SEC-MALS-SAXS) we defined which combination of components form transient or stable complexes. We used contrast matching neutron scattering to mask specific complex forming components to test whether components change conformation upon complexation. Altogether, we find that individual Nsp7, Nsp8 and Nsp12 structures vary based on whether other proteins in their complex are present. Combining our crystal structure, atomic coordinates reported elsewhere, SAXS, SANS and other biophysical techniques we provide greater insight into the RTC assembly, mechanism and potential avenues for disruption of the complex and its functions.","Wilamowski, Mateusz; Hammel, Michal; Leite, Wellington; Zhang, Qiu; Kim, Youngchang; Weiss, Kevin; Jedrzejczak, Robert; Rosenberg, Daniel J.; Fan, Yichong; Wower, Jacek; Bierma, Jan; Sarker, Altaf H.; Tsutakawa, Susan E.; Pingali, Sai Venkatesh; O’Neill, Hugh M.; Joachimiak, Andrzej; Hura, Greg L.",Biophys J,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2021.06.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34197805/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006349521004914; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349521004914?v=s5,168

645124,Planetary healthy publics after COVID-19,2021-04-08,"Viral infections are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and the importance of public health practices including handwashing and vaccinations in reducing their spread is well established. Furthermore, it is well known that proper nutrition can help support optimal immune function, reducing the impact of infections. Several vitamins and trace elements play an important role in supporting the cells of the immune system, thus increasing the resistance to infections. Other nutrients, such as omega-3 fatty acids, help sustain optimal function of the immune system. The main aim of this manuscript is to discuss of the potential role of micronutrients supplementation in supporting immunity, particularly against respiratory virus infections. Literature analysis showed that in vitro and observational studies, and clinical trials, highlight the important role of vitamins A, C, and D, omega-3 fatty acids, and zinc in modulating the immune response. Supplementation with vitamins, omega 3 fatty acids and zinc appears to be a safe and low-cost way to support optimal function of the immune system, with the potential to reduce the risk and consequences of infection, including viral respiratory infections. Supplementation should be in addition to a healthy diet and fall within recommended upper safety limits set by scientific expert bodies. Therefore, implementing an optimal nutrition, with micronutrients and omega-3 fatty acids supplementation, might be a cost-effective, underestimated strategy to help reduce the burden of infectious diseases worldwide, including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).","Pecora, Francesco; Persico, Federica; Argentiero, Alberto; Neglia, Cosimo; Esposito, Susanna",Nutrients,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33092041/; https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12103198,168

SSPE develops after prolonged persistence of mutated MeV called SSPE virus. Although a combination therapy using interferon and inosiplex or ribavirin appears to prolong survival time to some extent, there is currently no effective treatment to completely cure SSPE and a new treatment strategy is greatly needed. In this study, we adopted RNA interference (RNAi) strategy and examined whether small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) can be used to inhibit replication of MeV and SSPE virus. We report here that siRNAs targeted against L mRNA of MeV, either synthetic siRNAs or those generated by pcPUR + U6i-based expression plasmids, effectively and specifically inhibited replication of both MeV and SSPE virus without exhibiting any cytotoxic effect. The L protein of MeV is a major component of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that is essential for viral RNA replication, and yet it is least abundant among all the MeV proteins expressed. Therefore, mRNA encoding the L protein would be a good target for RNAi strategy. The present results imply the possibility that our siRNAs against MeV L mRNA are among the potential candidates to be used to treat patients with SSPE.","Otaki, Momoko; Sada, Kiyonao; Kadoya, Hiroyasu; Nagano-Fujii, Motoko; Hotta, Hak",Antiviral Res,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354206000295; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354206000295; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16530274/,168
650691,Sharing methods for global health research: an assessment of methodology,2013-10-20,"BACKGROUND: The use of new concepts in patient care, such as video-consultations, reminder systems, and online evaluation portals, is becoming increasingly important in the physician–patient relationship and outpatient care. This study examines the acceptance of these approaches in a neurological setting and determines the patients’ preferences. METHODS: We analyzed 16 guideline-based qualitative interviews with neurological patients using qualitative content analysis (inductive category formation). RESULTS: The patients commented on the benefits and challenges of integrating new concepts of medical care. They identified advantages of telemedical care, including time savings (7 of 16; 43,8%) for both the patient and the physician, the prospect of more intensive (4 of 16; 25%) care, and the possibility for a quick response in case of urgent needs (3 of 16; 18.8%). Several challenges were reported, such as the limitations for patients with psychiatric (2 of 16; 12.5%) or complex diseases (4 of 16; 25%) and limited options for diagnostic procedures (such as physical examination (4 of 16; 25%)). For individual neurological patients' needs, telemedical and telecommunication structures could be discussed, which support the patients' specific requirements, such as answering questions while having a recall (2 of 16; 12.5%) and avoiding the journey (8 of 16; 50%). Also, patients are rejecting evaluation portals and are skeptical of telecare in the treatment of neurological diseases. DISCUSSION: The perception of telemedical care and the successful integration of new medical care concepts depend on fulfilling the individual patient’s needs. Regardless of the preferred nature of physician–patient interactions, there are specific instruments that can intensify the relationship. These individual needs of the patients must be inquired about and accommodated for. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, we could characterize the properties of optimal telemedical care for neurological patients. Interviews like the ones we conducted should be repeated during and after the pandemic, referring to our results and compare.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We systematically searched in MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, Epistemonikos, Trip databases, websites of CPG developers, compilers of CPGs, scientific societies and ministries of health to identify documents with recommendations intended to minimize the risk of COVID-19 transmission during dental care. Reviewers independently and in duplicate assessed the included CPGs using the AGREE II instrument. We calculated the standardized scores for the six domains and made a final recommendation about each CPG. The inter-appraiser agreement was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). RESULTS: Twenty-three CPGs published were included. Most of the CPGs were from America (n=15) and Europe (n=6). The overall agreement between reviewers was very good (ICC = 0.93; 95%CI 0.87–0.95).

658297,Essential or not? Knowledge problems and COVID‐19 stay‐at‐home orders,2021-02-08,"OBJECTIVE: Healthcare workers (HCWs) are the backbone of the healthcare system and a skilled and healthy workforce is vital during a health crisis, such as the present coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Healthcare workers are at higher risk of exposure to and transmission of the severe acute respiratory coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Hence, HCWs should possess good knowledge and attitudes toward COVID-19 to protect not only themselves but also their colleagues, families and the larger community. Thus, the current study aims to assess the knowledge and practice of protective measures by HCWs in Saudi Arabia during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic to identify awareness of the disease, potential trends and associated predictors. METHODS: A cross-sectional, web-based study was conducted among HCWs about knowledge related to COVID-19 and practice of protective measures, such as social distancing and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic. A Fisher exact test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to investigate the level of association among variables. RESULTS: A total of 674 HCWs were recruited in the study (51.8% male, 42.7% aged 28–37 years old and 52% specialists). The Saudi Ministry of Health (MoH) was the main source of knowledge for most of the HCWs (89%) followed by the WHO (44.5%) and social media (42.3%). Washing hands before touching the face was the most selected choice (97.9%) as a precautionary method to limit SARS-CoV2 transmission. Most of the HCWs (74.6%) scored low for staying at home while the majority (71.2%) showed a high practice of personal protective methods, with pharmacists and general physicians scoring the highest. CONCLUSION: Saudi HCWs showed high knowledge and practice of protective measures for COVID-19. Good knowledge correlates with adoption of appropriate practices to prevent spread of infection. The current findings highlight the importance of interventions such as tailored education and training courses for those with low scores to improve overall knowledge and practice.","Binsaleh, Naif K; Bazaid, Abdulrahman S; Aldarhami, Abdu; Sherwani, Subuhi; Althomali, Omar W",J Multidiscip Healthc,https://doi.org/10.2147/jmdh.s317908; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34188482/,168

New self-care practices are presented. RECENT FINDINGS: Globally, thousands of health care practitioners and staff have been infected; many have died. Research studies reveal that this pandemic has threatened the health of healthcare staff, their families, and communities in many unique ways, such as fear of infecting family (lack of safety at home), moral injury, witnessing the suffering of the “innocent,” coping with a problem too big to solve (the enormity problem), and racial trauma. SUMMARY: The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the global population in ways not seen in a century. The unique self-care challenges of COVID-19 while enhancing the symptoms of burnout, i.e., physical, and mental exhaustion, despair, helplessness, and suicidal thinking, need to be addressed directly.

Many vaccines are already being mass produced and supplied to the population. However, the COVID-19 vaccination programme will be the biggest in history. Reaching herd immunity will require an unprecedented mass immunisation campaign that will take several months and millions of dollars. Using different network models, COVID-19 pandemic dynamics of different countries can be recapitulated such as in Italy. Stochastic computational simulations highlight that peak epidemic sizes in a population strongly depends on the social network structure. Assuming a vaccine efficacy of at least 80% in a mass vaccination program, at least 70%of a given pop ulation should be vaccinated to obtain herd immunity, independently of the social structure. If the vaccine efficacy reports lower levels of efficacy in practice, then the coverage of vaccine tion would be needed to be even higher. Simulations suggest that the “Ring of Vaccination” strategy, vaccinating susceptible contact and contact of contacts, would prevent new waves of COVID -19 meanwhile a high percent of the population is vaccinated.","Tetteh, Josephine N.A.; Kinh Nguyen, Van; Hernandez-Vargas, Esteban A.",J Theor Biol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022519321003131; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519321003131?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34508758/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2021.110894,168

METHODS: We fit logistic growth curves to reported daily case numbers, up to the first epidemic peak, for 58 countries for which 16 explanatory covariates are available. This fitting has been shown to robustly estimate R(0) from the specified period. We then use a generalized additive model (GAM) to discern both linear and nonlinear effects, and include 5 random effect covariates to account for potential differences in testing and reporting that can bias the estimated R(0). FINDINGS: We found that the mean R0 is 1.70 (S.D. 0.57), with a range between 1.10 (Ghana) and 3.52 (South Korea). We identified four factors—population between 20–34 years old (youth), population residing in urban agglomerates over 1 million (city), social media use to organize offline action (social media), and GINI income inequality—as having strong relationships with R(0), across countries. An intermediate level of youth and GINI inequality are associated with high R(0), (n-shape relationships), while high city population and high social media use are associated with high R(0). Pollution, temperature, and humidity did not have strong relationships with R(0) but were positive. CONCLUSION: Countries have different characteristics that predispose them to greater intrinsic vulnerability to COVID-19. Studies that aim to measure the effectiveness of interventions across locations should account for these baseline differences in social and demographic characteristics.","Kong, Jude Dzevela; Tekwa, Edward W.; Gignoux-Wolfsohn, Sarah A.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34106993/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0252373,168

PLC is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths and the rate of incidence is predicted to rise in the coming decades. PLC can be categorized into three major histological subtypes: hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), and combined HCC-ICC (cHCC-ICC). These subtypes are distinct with respect to epidemiology, clinicopathological features, genetic alterations, and clinical managements, which are thoroughly summarized in this review. The state of treatment strategies for each subtype, including the currently approved drugs and the potential novel therapies, are also discussed.","Feng, Mei; Pan, Yisheng; Kong, Ruirui; Shu, Shaokun",Innovation,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666675820300321?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666675820300321; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32914142/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xinn.2020.100032,168

These patients pose a particular challenge in the application of optimal care due to issues with infectious risk, respiratory compromise and potential interactions between medications that can be used to manage delirium with antiviral and other treatments used for COVID-19. We describe a guidance resource adapted from existing guidelines for delirium management that has been tailored to the specific challenge of managing delirium in patients with COVID-19 infection.

We performed a systematic review to summarize the clinical features, management, and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 who had ST-segment elevation. We searched electronic databases from inception to September 30, 2020 for studies that reported clinical data about COVID-19 patients with ST-segment elevation. Differences between patients with and without obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) on coronary angiography were evaluated. Forty-two studies (35 case reports and seven case series) involving 161 patients were included. The mean age was 62.7 ± 13.6 years and 75% were men. The most frequent symptom was chest pain (78%). Eighty-three percent of patients had obstructive CAD. Patients with non-obstructive CAD had more diffuse ST-segment elevation (13% versus 1%, p = 0.03) and diffuse left ventricular wall-motion abnormality (23% versus 3%, p = 0.02) compared to obstructive CAD. In patients with previous coronary stent (n = 17), the 76% presented with stent thrombosis. In the majority of cases, the main reperfusion strategy was primary percutaneous coronary intervention instead of fibrinolysis. The in-hospital mortality was 30% without difference between patients with (30%) or without (31%) obstructive CAD. Our data suggest that a relatively high proportion of COVID-19 patients with ST-segment elevation had non-obstructive CAD. The prognosis was poor across groups. However, our findings are based on case reports and case series that should be confirmed in future studies.

Findings from multiple bio‐behavioural surveys,2020-08-26,"BACKGROUND: . The outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) that was first detected in the city of Wuhan, China has now spread to every inhabitable continent, but now the attention has shifted from China to other epicentres. This study explored early assessment of the influence of spatial proximities and travel patterns from Italy on the further spread of SARS-CoV-2 around the globe. METHODS: . Using data on the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 and air travel data between countries, we applied a stochastic meta-population model to estimate the global spread of COVID-19. Pearson’s correlation, semi-variogram, and Moran’s Index were used to examine the association and spatial aucorretaion between the number of COVID-19 cases and travel influx (and arrival time) from the source country. RESULTS: . We found significant negative association between disease arrival time and number of cases imported from Italy (r= -0.43, p=0.004) and significant positive association between the number of COVID-19 cases and daily travel influx from Italy (r=0.39, p=0.011). Using bivariate Moran’s Index analysis, we found evidence of spatial interaction between COVID-19 cases and travel influx (Moran’s I=0.340). Asia-Pacific region is at higher/extreme risk of disease importation from the Chinese epicentre, whereas the rest of Europe, South-America and Africa are more at risk from the Italian epicentre. CONCLUSION: . We showed that as the epicentre changes, the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 spread change to reflect spatial proximities.","Adegboye, Oyelola A.; Adekunle, Adeshina I.; Pak, Anton; Gayawan, Ezra; Leung, Denis HY.; Rojas, Diana P.; Elfaki, Faiz; McBryde, Emma S.; Eisen, Damon P.",Travel Med Infect Dis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1477893921000296?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1477893921000296; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33578044/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2021.101988,168

Les PVVIH (personnes vivant avec le VIH) peuvent se sentir plus à risque d’infection grave à COVID-19, et comme les personnes plus âgées, pourraient être plus favorables à la vaccination. Matériels et méthodes Chez des patient(e)s suivi(e)s pour une infection à VIH, une enquête a été réalisée prospectivement et de façon exhaustive, entre septembre et décembre 2020, avant la mise à disposition des vaccins, pour connaître les intentions de vaccination contre la COVID-19. La notion de vaccination grippale et la perception du sur-risque lié à l’infection à VIH étaient également évaluées. Résultats Au total, 363 personnes ont répondu, dont 234 femmes, d’âge médian 49 ans [25–73]. Les deux tiers (242) étaient originaires d’Afrique subsaharienne. Leur infection à VIH était connue depuis en médiane 15 ans [1–33]. Concernant la vaccination grippale, 263/363 (72 %) avaient reçu au moins une fois une vaccination, dont les 2/3 (n =167) presque chaque année. Trente-quatre patients (9,3 %) ont déclaré avoir eu une infection par COVID-19, dont 19 de façon prouvée (PCR ou sérologie+) et 3 ont été hospitalisés. La perception du sur-risque lié à l’infection à VIH était hétérogène, 150 (41 %) ne se considéraient pas comme « plus à risque de COVID », contre 108 (30 %) se considérant plus à risque, 104 (29 %) ne savaient pas. Seuls 1/3 des patients (n =121) envisageaient une vaccination contre la COVID-19, 72 (20 %) peut-être, 100 (28 %) ne savaient pas et 70 (19 %) refusaient. Dans cette série, les hommes étaient plus disposés à être vaccinés que les femmes, 64 % versus 47 %, (p <0,003), il s’agit d’un facteur déjà rapporté dans la littérature. Dans les autres facteurs associés, seulement 19 % des personnes se sentant plus à risque refusaient la vaccination versus 30 % de ceux ne se sentant pas à risque (p =0,05). Les patients vaccinés contre la grippe étaient plus prêts à se vacciner (56 %) que les patients jamais vaccinés (45 %), (p =0,05). Ni la région de naissance (ASS, Antilles, Europe), ni l’âge, n’étaient associés à une différence dans l’acceptation d’une vaccination COVID. Conclusion Un tiers des patients suivis pour une infection VIH dans notre service envisageaient de se faire vacciner contre la COVID-19, et 193 (53 %) avec les patients envisageant « peut-être » cette vaccination. Ces chiffres étaient comparables aux résultats des sondages en France à cette période. Le sexe masculin, le fait de se sentir plus à risque du fait de l’infection à VIH et d’avoir reçu une vaccination grippale, étaient des facteurs associés à l’acceptation de la vaccination COVID. Moins de 10 % de nos patients rapportent une infection à COVID-19, dont deux patientes asymptomatiques (diagnostic sérologique).

668161,Health outcomes of tourism development: A longitudinal study of the impact of tourism arrivals on residents’ health,2020-09-30,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been reported to cause worse outcomes in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease, especially in patients with acute cardiac injury, which is determined by elevated levels of high-sensitivity troponin. There is a paucity of data on the impact of congestive heart failure (CHF) on outcomes in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We conducted a literature search of PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, and Google Scholar databases from 11/1/2019 till 06/07/2020, and identified all relevant studies reporting cardiovascular comorbidities, cardiac biomarkers, disease severity, and survival. Pooled data from the selected studies was used for metanalysis to identify the impact of risk factors and cardiac biomarker elevation on disease severity and/or mortality. RESULTS: We collected pooled data on 5,967 COVID-19 patients from 20 individual studies. We found that both non-survivors and those with severe disease had an increased risk of acute cardiac injury and cardiac arrhythmias, our pooled relative risk (RR) was — 8.52 (95% CI 3.63–19.98) (p<0.001); and 3.61 (95% CI 2.03–6.43) (p=0.001), respectively. Mean difference in the levels of Troponin-I, CK-MB, and NT-proBNP was higher in deceased and severely infected patients. The RR of in-hospital mortality was 2.35 (95% CI 1.18–4.70) (p=0.022) and 1.52 (95% CI 1.12–2.05) (p=0.008) among patients who had pre-existing CHF and hypertension, respectively. CONCLUSION: Cardiac involvement in COVID-19 infection appears to significantly adversely impact patient prognosis and survival. Pre-existence of CHF, and high cardiac biomarkers like NT-pro BNP and CK-MB levels in COVID-19 patients correlates with worse outcomes.","Dalia, Tarun; Lahan, Shubham; Ranka, Sagar; Acharya, Prakash; Gautam, Archana; Mastoris, Ioannis; Sauer, Andrew; Shah, Zubair",Indian Heart J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33714416/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ihj.2020.12.002; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0019483220304417; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019483220304417?v=s5,168
668563,"Forum: Technology, Ecology, and Human Health Since 1850",2015-09-11,"The glucocorticoid receptor (GCR) and the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) are members of the steroid receptor superfamily of hormone-dependent transcription factors. The receptors are structurally and functionally related. They are localized in the cytosol and translocate into the nucleus after ligand binding. GCRs and MRs can be co-expressed within the same cell, and it is believed that the balance in GCR and MR expression is crucial for homeostasis and plays a key role in normal adaptation. In critical illness, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is activated, and as a consequence, serum cortisol concentrations are high. However, a number of patients exhibit relatively low cortisol levels for the degree of illness severity. Glucocorticoid (GC) actions are facilitated by GCR, whose dysfunction leads to GC tissue resistance. The MR is unique in this family in that it binds to both aldosterone and cortisol. Endogenous GCs play a critical role in controlling inflammatory responses in critical illness. Intracellular GC concentrations can differ greatly from blood levels due to the action of the two 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase isozymes, type 1 and type 2. 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases interconvert endogenous active cortisol and intrinsically inert cortisone. The degree of expression of the two isozymes has the potential to dramatically influence local GC availability within cells and tissues. In this review, we will explore the clinical studies that aimed to elucidate the role of MR and GCR expression in the inflammatory response seen in critical illness.","Vassiliou, Alice G; Athanasiou, Nikolaos; Vassiliadi, Dimitra A; Jahaj, Edison; Keskinidou, Chrysi; Kotanidou, Anastasia; Dimopoulou, Ioanna",World J Crit Care Med,https://doi.org/10.5492/wjccm.v10.i4.102; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34316445/,168

Among those, cleaning of large wall areas manually is always tedious, time-consuming, and astounding task. Although numerous cleaning companies are interested in deploying robotic cleaning solutions, they are mostly not addressing wall cleaning. To this end, we are proposing a new vision-based wall following framework that acts as an add-on for any professional robotic platform to perform wall cleaning. The proposed framework uses Deep Learning (DL) framework to visually detect, classify, and segment the wall/floor surface and instructs the robot to wall follow to execute the cleaning task. Also, we summarized the system architecture of Toyota Human Support Robot (HSR), which has been used as our testing platform. We evaluated the performance of the proposed framework on HSR robot under various defined scenarios. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed framework could successfully classify and segment the wall/floor surface and also detect the obstacle on wall and floor with high detection accuracy and demonstrates a robust behavior of wall following.","Teng, Tey Wee; Veerajagadheswar, Prabakaran; Ramalingam, Balakrishnan; Yin, Jia; Elara Mohan, Rajesh; Gómez, Braulio Félix",Sensors (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/s20113298; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32531960/,168

Methods We used random model to calculate the number of initial infected patients. And Poisson distribution was used to determine the number of initial infected patients based on the number of countries involved. Further, to simulate the COVID-19 transmission, the susceptible-exposed-symptomatic-asymptomatic-recovered-hospitalized (SEIARH) model was established based on susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) mathematical model of epidemic diseases. According to risk assessment indicators produced by different scenarios of the simulated interventions, the risk of COVID-19 transmission in Tokyo Olympic Games was assessed. Results The large-scale vaccination will effectively control the spread of COVID-19.

All FDA-approved immunoadhesins are designed to modulate the interaction of a human receptor with its normal ligand, such as Etanercept (Enbrel(®)), which interferes with the binding of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) to the TNF-alpha receptor and is used to treat inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. Like antibodies, immunoadhesins have long circulating half-lives, are readily purified by affinity-based methods and have the avidity advantages conferred by bivalency. Immunoadhesins that incorporate normal cellular receptors for viruses or bacterial toxins hold great, but as yet unrealized, potential for treating infectious disease. As decoy receptors, immunoadhesins have potential advantages over pathogen-targeted monoclonal antibodies. Planet Biotechnology has specialized in developing anti-infective immunoadhesins using plant expression systems. An immunoadhesin incorporating the cellular receptor for anthrax toxin, CMG2, potently blocks toxin activity in vitro and protects animals against inhalational anthrax. An immunoadhesin based on the receptor for human rhinovirus, ICAM-1, potently blocks infection of human cells by one of the major causes of the common cold.

685282,"Invasive alien plant species: Their impact on environment, ecosystem services and human health",2020-01-09,"In January 2020, anthropogenic emissions in Northeast Asia reduced due to the COVID-19 outbreak. When outdoor activities of the public were limited, PM(2.5) concentrations in China and South Korea between February and March 2020 reduced by − 16.8 μg/m(3) and − 9.9 μg/m(3) respectively, compared with the average over the previous three years. This study uses air quality modeling and observations over the past four years to separate the influence of reductions in anthropogenic emissions from meteorological changes and emission control policies on this PM(2.5) concentration change. Here, we show that the impacts of anthropogenic pollution reduction on PM(2.5) were found to be approximately − 16% in China and − 21% in South Korea, while those of meteorology and emission policies were − 7% and − 8% in China, and − 5% and − 4% in South Korea, respectively. These results show that the influence on PM(2.5) concentration differs across time and region and according to meteorological conditions and emission control policies. Finally, the influence of reductions in anthropogenic emissions was greater than that of meteorological conditions and emission policies during COVID-19 period.","Kang, Yoon-Hee; You, Seunghee; Bae, Minah; Kim, Eunhye; Son, Kyuwon; Bae, Changhan; Kim, Yoonha; Kim, Byeong-Uk; Kim, Hyun Cheol; Kim, Soontae",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-79088-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33335171/,168
687661,200 Years of Florence and the challenges of nursing practices management in the COVID-19 pandemic,2020-09-07,"Fatigue is a common symptom in those presenting with symptomatic COVID-19 infection. However, it is unknown if COVID-19 results in persistent fatigue in those recovered from acute infection. We examined the prevalence of fatigue in individuals recovered from the acute phase of COVID-19 illness using the Chalder Fatigue Score (CFQ-11). We further examined potential predictors of fatigue following COVID-19 infection, evaluating indicators of COVID-19 severity, markers of peripheral immune activation and circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines. Of 128 participants (49.5 ± 15 years; 54% female), more than half reported persistent fatigue (67/128; 52.3%) at median of 10 weeks after initial COVID-19 symptoms. There was no association between COVID-19 severity (need for inpatient admission, supplemental oxygen or critical care) and fatigue following COVID-19. Additionally, there was no association between routine laboratory markers of inflammation and cell turnover (leukocyte, neutrophil or lymphocyte counts, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein) or pro-inflammatory molecules (IL-6 or sCD25) and fatigue post COVID-19. Female gender and those with a pre-existing diagnosis of depression/anxiety were over-represented in those with fatigue. Our findings demonstrate a significant burden of post-viral fatigue in individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection after the acute phase of COVID-19 illness. This study highlights the importance of assessing those recovering from COVID-19 for symptoms of severe fatigue, irrespective of severity of initial illness, and may identify a group worthy of further study and early intervention.","Townsend, Liam; Dyer, Adam H.; Jones, Karen; Dunne, Jean; Mooney, Aoife; Gaffney, Fiona; O'Connor, Laura; Leavy, Deirdre; O'Brien, Kate; Dowds, Joanne; Sugrue, Jamie A.; Hopkins, David; Martin-Loeches, Ignacio; Ni Cheallaigh, Cliona; Nadarajan, Parthiban; McLaughlin, Anne Marie; Bourke, Nollaig M.; Bergin, Colm; O'Farrelly, Cliona; Bannan, Ciaran; Conlon, Niall",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33166287/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0240784,168
688337,Human Health Link to Invasive Species,2011-03-03,"Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) causes highly contagious respiratory or urogenital tract diseases in chickens. The Maryland 27(Md27) strain was first isolated in 1976 from diseased chicken flocks in the Delmarva Peninsula region. To understand the genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationship of existing strains with Md27, the complete nucleotide sequence of the 3′end coding region (∼7.2 kb) of Md27 was determined and compared with other IBV strains and coronaviruses. It has the same S-3-M-5-N-3′ gene order, as is the case of other IBV strains. The spike gene of Md27 exhibits 97% identity with the SE17 strain. There are deletions at the spike gene, non-coding region between M and 5 genes, and at the 3′ untranslated region (UTR), which is different from Ark-like strains. Phylogenetic analysis and sequence alignments demonstrate that Md27 is a chimera containing different gene segments that are most closely related to the SE17, Conn and JMK strains. This current study provides evidence for genomic mutations and intergenic recombination that have taken place in the evolution of IBV strain Md27.","Ammayappan, Arun; Vakharia, Vikram N.",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21994587/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v1031166,168
