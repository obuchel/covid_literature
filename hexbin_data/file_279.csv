The literature in the pediatric population is limited, therefore, we conducted this study to evaluate the indications, timing, complications, and outcomes of tracheostomy among the children at our center. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted from January 2016 through December 2019. Data was collected from the patients’ records and analyzed. RESULTS: During this study period, 283 children were ventilated, of which 26 (9.1%) required tracheostomy. Among this 73% were boys. The median age of the children who underwent tracheostomy was 6.32 y. The most common indication for tracheostomy was prolonged mechanical ventilation [24 cases (92%)] followed by upper airway obstruction [2 cases (8%)]. The average time of tracheostomy was 11.65 d, range (1–21 d). Complications were seen in 14 patients (55%). The most common complications were accidental decannulation, occlusion, pneumothorax, and granulation tissue. Twenty one (80%) patients were successfully discharged, out of which 16 (61%) patients were discharged after decannulation and 5 (21%) were sent home with a tracheostomy tube in situ. Overall mortality in present study was 11.5%; none was directly related to tracheostomy. CONCLUSIONS: The indication for tracheostomy has been changed from emergency to more elective one. Prolonged mechanical ventilation is the most common indication for tracheostomy. Although the timing of tracheostomy is not fixed, two weeks time is reasonable and it can be done safely at the bedside in pediatric intensive care.","Jain, Mukesh Kumar; Patnaik, Sibabratta; Sahoo, Bandya; Mishra, Reshmi; Behera, Jyoti Ranjan",Indian J Pediatr,279,1

Induction of RABV-specific binding antibodies and immunoglobulin isotypes (IgM, total IgG, IgG1, IgG2) were comparable in orally and parenterally vaccinated foxes. Differences were only observed in the induction of virus-neutralizing (VNA) titers, which were significantly higher in the parenterally vaccinated group. The dynamics of rabies-specific antibodies pre- and post-challenge (365 days post vaccination) suggest the predominance of type-1 immunity protection of SPBN GASGAS. Independent of the route of administration, in the absence of IgG1 the immune response to SPBN GAGAS was mainly IgG2 driven. Interestingly, vaccination with SPBN GASGAS does not cause significant differences in inducible IFN-γ production in vaccinated animals, indicating a relatively weak cellular immune response during challenge. Notably, the parenteral application of SPBN GASGAS did not induce any adverse side effects in foxes, thus supporting safety studies of this oral rabies vaccine in various species.","te Kamp, Verena; Friedrichs, Virginia; Freuling, Conrad M.; Vos, Ad; Potratz, Madlin; Klein, Antonia; Zaeck, Luca M.; Eggerbauer, Elisa; Schuster, Peter; Kaiser, Christian; Ortmann, Steffen; Kretzschmar, Antje; Bobe, Katharina; Knittler, Michael R.; Dorhoi, Anca; Finke, Stefan; Müller, Thomas",Vaccines (Basel),279,5

More data on HIV-positive men (MLHIV) committing IPV are needed to develop perpetrator-focused IPV and HIV prevention interventions. We investigated the relationship between IPV and HIV transmission risk and IPV-associated factors. METHODS: We used data from the cross-sectional survey EVOLCam which was conducted in Cameroonian outpatient HIV structures in 2014. The study population comprised MLHIV declaring at least one sexual partner in the previous year. Using principal component analysis, we built three variables measuring, respectively, self-reported MLHIV-perpetrated psychological and physical IPV (PPV), severe physical IPV (SPV), and sexual IPV (SV). Ordinal logistic regressions helped investigate: i) the relationship between HIV transmission risk (defined as unstable aviremia and inconsistent condom use) and IPV variables, ii) factors associated with each IPV variable. RESULTS: PPV, SPV and SV were self-reported by 28, 15 and 11% of the 406 study participants, respectively. IPV perpetrators had a significantly higher risk of transmitting HIV than non-IPV perpetrators. Factors independently associated with IPV variables were: i) socio-demographic, economic and dyadic factors, including younger age (PPV and SPV), lower income (PPV), not being the household head (SPV and SV), living with a main partner (SPV), and having a younger main partner (SPV); ii) sexual behaviors, including ≥2 partners in the previous year (PPV and SPV), lifetime sex with another man (SPV), inconsistent condom use (SV), and >20 partners during lifetime (SV); iii) HIV-related stigma (PPV and SV). CONCLUSION: IPV perpetrators had a higher risk of transmitting HIV and having lifetime and recent risky sexual behaviors. Perpetrating IPV was more frequent in those with socioeconomic vulnerability and self-perceived HIV-related stigma. These findings highlight the need for interventions to prevent IPV by MLHIV and related HIV transmission to their(s) partner(s).","Fiorentino, Marion; Sow, Abdourahmane; Sagaon-Teyssier, Luis; Mora, Marion; Mengue, Marie-Thérèse; Vidal, Laurent; Kuaban, Christopher; March, Laura; Laurent, Christian; Spire, Bruno; Boyer, Sylvie",PLoS One,279,1

It is therefore necessary to conduct postmarketing vaccine safety assessments using observational data sources. The study of rare events has been enabled in through large linked databases and distributed data networks, in combination with development of case-centred methods. Distributed data networks necessitate common protocols, definitions, data models and analytics and the processes of developing and employing these tools are rapidly evolving. Assessment of vaccine safety in pregnancy is complicated by physiological changes, the challenges of mother-child linkage and the need for long-term infant follow-up. Potential sources of bias including differential access to and utilisation of antenatal care, immortal time bias, seasonal timing of pregnancy and unmeasured determinants of pregnancy outcomes have yet to be fully explored. Available tools for assessment of evidence generated in postmarketing studies may downgrade evidence from observational data and prioritise evidence from randomised controlled trials. However, real-world evidence based on real-world data is increasingly being used for safety assessments, and new tools for evaluating real-world evidence have been developed. The future of vaccine safety surveillance, particularly for rare events and in special populations, comprises the use of big data in single countries as well as in collaborative networks. This move towards the use of real-world data requires continued development of methodologies to generate and assess real world evidence.","Dodd, Caitlin; Andrews, Nick; Petousis-Harris, Helen; Sturkenboom, Miriam; Omer, Saad B; Black, Steven",BMJ Glob Health,279,5

Laryngeal mask airway (LMA) is claimed to be associated to decreasing perioperative respiratory complications compared to endotracheal tube (ETT) in infants under one year of age receiving minor surgery; thus, we conducted a retrospective survey in former preterm neonates below 5000 g to compare the respiratory complications between LMA and ETT in general anesthesia for inguinal hernia surgeries. METHODS: The inclusion criteria were: gestational age at birth under 37 weeks, body weight at surgery below 5000 g, and receiving scheduled inguinal hernia repair under general anesthesia with LMA or ETT. Infants who were dependent on mechanical ventilation preoperatively were excluded. The postoperative respiratory complications including delayed extubation, re-intubation, and apnea within postoperative 24 h were compared between groups. RESULTS: From July 2014 to December 2017, 72 neonates were enrolled into final analysis. There were 57 neonates managed with LMA, and only 15 neonates intubated with ETT during the study period. The gestational age at birth and post-menstrual age at surgery showed no significant difference between groups, although in the ETT group, the body weight at birth and at surgery were lower, and more infants had history of severe respiratory distress syndrome and had received oxygen therapy within two weeks prior to surgery. Surprisingly, none one of the infants developed delayed extubation, re-intubation, or postoperative apnea in the LMA group. In the ETT group, 40 percent of the neonates could not be successfully extubated in the operation theater. CONCLUSION: In preterm neonates, even in those younger than 52 weeks post-menstrual age who undergoing inguinal hernia repair in their early infancy, LMA appears feasible and safe as the airway device during general anesthesia in specific patient group. However, anesthesiologist might prefer ETT rather than LMA in some complex situation. In neonates with lower body weight at birth and at surgery, and with a history of severe RDS and oxygen-dependence, further prospective study is required.","Su, Miao-Pei; Hu, Ping-Yang; Lin, Jao-Yu; Yang, Shu-Ting; Cheng, Kuang-I; Lin, Chia-Heng",BMC Anesthesiol,279,8

However, this growing interest in digital technologies in public health has not been accompanied by a clarity of scope to guide policy, practice, and research in this rapidly emergent field. OBJECTIVE: This scoping review seeks to determine the scope of digital health as described by public health researchers and practitioners and to consolidate a conceptual framework of digital public health. METHODS: The review follows Arksey and O’Malley’s framework for conducting scoping reviews with improvements as suggested by Levac et al. The search strategy will be applied to Embase, Medline, and Google Scholar. A grey literature search will be conducted on intergovernmental agency websites and country-specific websites. Titles and abstracts will be reviewed by independent reviewers, while full-text reviews will be conducted by 2 reviewers to determine eligibility based on prespecified inclusion and exclusion criteria. The data will be coded in an iterative approach using the best-fit framework analysis methodology. RESULTS: This research project received funding from the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control Foundation for Population and Public Health on January 1, 2020. The initial search was conducted on June 1, 2020 and returned 6953 articles in total. After deduplication, 4523 abstracts were reviewed, and 227 articles have been included in the review. Ethical approval is not required for this review as it uses publicly available data. CONCLUSIONS: We anticipate that the findings of the scoping review will contribute relevant evidence to health policy makers and public health practitioners involved in planning, funding, and delivering health services that leverage digital technologies. Results of the review will be strategically disseminated through publications in scientific journals, conferences, and engagement with relevant stakeholders.

Nevertheless, the genetic similarity between Shigella spp. and Escherichia coli challenges the correct identification and serotyping of Shigella spp., with subsequent negative repercussions on surveillance, epidemiological investigations, and selection of appropriate treatments. For this purpose, multiple techniques have been developed historically ranging from phenotype-based methods and single or multilocus molecular techniques to whole-genome sequencing (WGS). To facilitate the selection of the most relevant method, we herein provide a global overview of historical and emerging identification and serotyping techniques with a particular focus on the WGS-based approaches. This review highlights the excellent discriminatory power of WGS to more accurately elucidate the epidemiology of Shigella spp., disclose novel promising genomic targets for surveillance methods, and validate previous well-established methods.","Halimeh, Fatima Bachir; Rafei, Rayane; Osman, Marwan; Kassem, Issmat I.; Diene, Seydina M.; Dabboussi, Fouad; Rolain, Jean-Marc; Hamze, Monzer",Braz J Microbiol,279,1

At the same time, the environmental quality in China has deteriorated significantly. In this study, provincial-level data for 31 Chinese provinces during 2007–2017 are used to investigate the impacts of government expenditure on the emissions of three specific measures of environmental degradation. The main objective of this study is to examine the influence of government expenditures, economic growth per capita, environment protection expenditure, and added second-sector value on environmental quality by measuring sulfur dioxide (SO(2)), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and ammonia nitrogen emissions (AN). Moreover, the study applied the generalized method of moments (GMM) and the fully modified least square (FMOLS) to estimate the co-integration relationship among the underlying factors. The results demonstrate a significant direct effect of government expenditure on improving environmental quality overall in the Chinese provinces, which increases with the level of economic growth. However, the results also confirmed the inverted N-shaped relationship between the pollution factor and economic growth per capita. Our key findings lead toward the manifestation and emphasis of the importance of appropriate policies for restoring government expenditure and, at the same time, strengthening the relationship between the industrial sector and environmental policy standards. Significantly, governments in developing countries should allocate larger budgets for environmental projects in their fiscal reforms for the sake of moving to greener and more inclusive economies with low-carbon activities.","Zeraibi, Ayoub; Balsalobre-Lorente, Daniel; Shehzad, Khurram",Int J Environ Res Public Health,279,1
23663,23663,23663,A Cognitive-Behavioral Perspective,19.759254,4.4307003,2007,"Neuropsychiatric disorders and dementia represent a major cause of disability and high cost in developed societies. Most disorders of the central nervous system (CNS) share some common features, such as a genomic background in which hundreds of genes might be involved, genome-environment interactions, complex pathogenic pathways, poor therapeutic outcomes, and chronic disability. Recent advances in genomic medicine can contribute to accelerate our understanding on the pathogenesis of CNS disorders, improve diagnostic accuracy with the introduction of novel biomarkers, and personalize therapeutics with the incorporation of pharmacogenetic and pharmacogenomic procedures to drug development and clinical practice. The pharmacological treatment of CNS disorders, in general, accounts for 10–20% of direct costs, and less than 30–40% of the patients are moderate responders to conventional drugs, some of which may cause important adverse drugs reactions (ADRs). Pharmacogenetic and pharmacogenomic factors may account for 60–90% of drug variability in drug disposition and pharmacodynamics. Approximately 60–80% of CNS drugs are metabolized via enzymes of the CYP gene superfamily; 18% of neuroleptics are major substrates of CYP1A2 enzymes, 40% of CYP2D6, and 23% of CYP3A4; 24% of antidepressants are major substrates of CYP1A2 enzymes, 5% of CYP2B6, 38% of CYP2C19, 85% of CYP2D6, and 38% of CYP3A4; 7% of benzodiazepines are major substrates of CYP2C19 enzymes, 20% of CYP2D6, and 95% of CYP3A4. About 10–20% of Caucasians are carriers of defective CYP2D6 polymorphic variants that alter the metabolism of many psychotropic agents. Other 100 genes participate in the efficacy and safety of psychotropic drugs. The incorporation of pharmacogenetic/ pharmacogenomic protocols to CNS research and clinical practice can foster therapeutics optimization by helping to develop cost-effective pharmaceuticals and improving drug efficacy and safety. To achieve this goal several measures have to be taken, including: (a) educate physicians and the public on the use of genetic/ genomic screening in the daily clinical practice; (b) standardize genetic testing for major categories of drugs; (c) validate pharmacogenetic and pharmacogenomic procedures according to drug category and pathology; (d) regulate ethical, social, and economic issues; and (e) incorporate pharmacogenetic and pharmacogenomic procedures to both drugs in development and drugs in the market to optimize therapeutics.","Cacabelos, Ramón","The Handbook of Neuropsychiatric Biomarkers, Endophenotypes and Genes",279,5

High mutation rates, large population sizes, and short generation times contribute to their typically fast evolutionary rates. However, many additional processes operate on their genomes, often in opposite directions, driving their evolution and allowing them to adapt to diverse host populations and antiviral drugs. Until recently, the high levels of genetic variation of most viruses have been explored only at a few genes or genome regions. The recent advent and increasing affordability of next-generation sequencing techniques have allowed obtaining complete genome sequences of large numbers of viruses, mainly HIV, HCV, influenza A, and others associated with emerging infections, such as Zika, chikungunya, or dengue virus. This opens the possibility to explore the effects of the different processes affecting viral diversity and evolution at the genome level. Consequently, population genomics provides the conceptual and empirical tools necessary to interpret genetic variation in viruses and its dynamics and drivers and to transform these results into information that may complement the epidemiological surveillance of the virus and its disease. This chapter provides an overview of human viruses from a population genomics perspective, with a special emphasis on RNA viruses, and the potential benefits of “genomic surveillance” to establish public health policies that improve the control and monitoring of the diseases caused by these viruses.","González-Candelas, Fernando; Patiño-Galindo, Juan Ángel; Valiente-Mullor, Carlos",Population Genomics: Microorganisms,279,5

Statements made at the outset of the pandemic, including those from the World Health Organization (WHO), the United States Surgeon General, and the Chief Public Health Officer of Canada, all actively discouraged asymptomatic members of the general public from wearing masks. However, on April 3, 2020, the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued new recommendations that called for nonmedical masks, such as cloth face coverings, to be worn in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (Adams, 2020). Canadian public health officials quickly followed with their own guidance for wearing nonmedical masks or face coverings when out in public; however, they have stressed that doing so is optional for asymptomatic persons and should be seen as a complement to existing precautionary measures such as physical distancing and hand hygiene, particularly in cases where physical distancing may not be feasible (Public Health Agency of Canada, 2020). Emphasis was placed on nonmedical masks serving not to protect the wearer, but rather others who come within close proximity of the wearer.

Drawing on the broaden–and–build theory of positive emotions, this study proposes challenge stressors as a critical predictor of identity orientation. The purpose of this article is to explore if a particular identity is salient in different contextual factors, and this study suggests that challenge stressors stimulate personal, relational, and collective identities to respond to a situation. The relationships hypothesized in this study were tested using a sample of 225 employees from the banking sector of Pakistan. A time-lagged research design consisting of two waves of data collection was employed. A structural equation modeling technique was used to test the hypotheses regarding the relationship between challenge stressors and identity orientation, including the role of thriving at work and employee investment as intervening mechanisms of this relationship. Results showed that challenge stressors had a significant positive relationship with identity orientation. The results also confirmed the sequential mediation of thriving at work and employee investment in the relationship between challenge stressors and identity orientation. The findings suggest that the positive side of stress as a strength motivates employees for continued self-development. Importantly, challenge stressors enhance employees’ ability to thrive at work and, in turn, they invest in the work more and identify themselves strongly with their organization and work.","Saleem, Sharjeel; Humayun, Shazia; Latif, Bilal; Iftikhar, Umer; Sharif, Imran",Front Psychol,279,10

Using 60,844 cases from Pennsylvania Cancer Registry, we calculated and mapped the age-adjusted incidence rates for five Pennsylvania (PA) counties near Philadelphia between 1998–2007 and 2008–2017. We identified ZIP codes with significantly higher incidence rates than the state rates and examined their demographic and exposure characteristics. Further, we tested for spatial autocorrelation and identified spatial clusters using Moran’s I statistic. Our results showed that approximately one in four ZIP codes had an incidence rate that was significantly higher than the PA state rate in each period studied. Clusters of higher incidences were detected in the southeastern part of PA bordering New Jersey. These areas tended to be more populated, of lower socioeconomic status, and closer to manufacturing facilities and major highways. Possibly driven by the community and environmental factors, the observed differences in disease incidence suggest the importance of including residential location in risk assessment tools for lung cancer.","Zhu, Yaqian; McKeon, Thomas P.; Tam, Vicky; Vachani, Anil; Penning, Trevor M.; Hwang, Wei-Ting",Int J Environ Res Public Health,279,1

However, its biological function in humans remains unclear. This study sought to investigate the relationship between circulating MG53 levels and coronary artery disease (CAD). Methods: The concentration of MG53 was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in serum samples from 639 patients who underwent angiography, including 205 controls, 222 patients with stable CAD, and 212 patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Logistic and linear regression analyses were used to analyze the relationship between MG53 and CAD. Results: MG53 levels were increased in patients with stable CAD and were highest in patients with AMI. Additionally, patients with comorbidities, such as chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetes also had a higher concentration of MG53. We found that MG53 is a significant diagnostic marker of CAD and AMI, as analyzed by logistic regression models. Multivariate linear regression models revealed that serum MG53 was significantly corelated positively with SYNTAX scores. Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) scores also correlated with serum MG53 levels, indicating that MG53 levels were associated with the severity of CAD and AMI after adjusting for multiple risk factors and clinical biomarkers. Conclusion: MG53 is a valuable diagnostic marker whose serum levels correlate with the presence and severity of stable CAD and AMI, and may represent a novel biomarker for diagnosing CAD and indicating the severity of CAD.","Xie, Hongyang; Wang, Yaqiong; Zhu, Tianqi; Feng, Shuo; Yan, Zijun; Zhu, Zhengbin; Ni, Jingwei; Ni, Jun; Du, Run; Zhu, Jinzhou; Ding, Fenghua; Liu, Shengjun; Han, Hui; Zhang, Hang; Zhao, Jiaxin; Zhang, Ruiyan; Quan, Weiwei; Yan, Xiaoxiang",Front Physiol,279,1

Like most large entomology collections, no complete inventory of the species represented in the collection was available and even a physical search for a species could not ensure that all available specimens would be recovered for study. Between 2010 and 2014, we created a species-level index (called here spindex) of all species and their specimen counts at ANSP, along with each species’ location in the collection. Additional data captured during the project included the higher level classification of each species and type of specimen preparation. The spindex is searchable online: http://symbiont.ansp.org/entomology/. The spindex project documented 96,126 species in the ANSP Entomology Collection, representing about 10% of the described insect fauna. Additionally, over 900 putative primary types were discovered outside the Primary Type Collection. The completion of this project has improved access to the collection by enabling scientists and other users worldwide to search these collection holdings remotely and has facilitated staff in curation, research, collection management and funding proposals. A spindex is an important tool that is overlooked for planning and carrying out specimen level digitisation. This project is a case study for building a species-level index.

To examine whether media reports about violence against medical care providers in China follow professional journalism recommendations, we identified 10 influential incidents of violence against medical care providers in China through a systematic strategy and used standardized internet-based search techniques to retrieve media reports about these events from 2007–2017. Reports were evaluated independently by trained coders to assess adherence to professional journalism recommendations using a 14-item checklist. In total, 788 eligible media reports were considered. Of those, 50.5% and 47.3%, respectively, failed to mention the real and complete names of the writer and editor. Reports improperly mentioned specific details about the time, place, methods, and perpetrators of violence in 42.1%, 36.4%, 45.4%, and 54.6% of cases, respectively. Over 80% of reports excluded a suggestion to seek help from professional agencies or mediation by a third party and only 3.8% of reports mentioned the perspectives of all three key informants about an event: medical care providers, patients, and hospital administrators. Of those that mentioned medical care providers, patient, and/or hospital administrator perspectives, less than 20% indicated they had obtained the interviewee’s consent to include their perspective. We concluded that most reports about violence against medical care providers in the Chinese media failed to strictly follow reporting recommendations from authoritative media bodies. Efforts are recommended to improve adherence to professional guidelines in media reports about violence against medical care providers in China, as adherence to those guidelines is likely to reduce future violent events against medical care providers like doctors and nurses.","Tan, Liheng; Yuan, Shujuan; Cheng, Peixia; Ning, Peishan; Gao, Yuyan; Xiao, Wangxin; Schwebel, David C.; Hu, Guoqing",Int J Environ Res Public Health,279,13

The rhododendron honey had the highest acidity (p < 0.05) while the chestnut honey showed the highest conductivity (1.13 ± 0.25 mS/cm) among all (p < 0.05). The highest diastase activities and the lowest HMF contents were determined in the multifloral and chestnut honey. Considering the DPPH and FRAP assays, the multifloral honey showed the highest antioxidant activity. Accordingly, the highest total phenolic content was determined in the multifloral honey followed by rhododendron, chestnut, and acacia honey. A moderate correlation was determined between the total phenolic content and antioxidant activities (r = 0.575 for FRAP and r = 0.697 for DPPH). Consequently, the plateau honey could be recommended for nutritional and health purposes due to its relatively higher antioxidant activity and total phenolic content together with relatively lower HMF content and higher diastase activity. Considering that Ordu is the largest honey producer city in Turkey, the second top honey producer country, this work could shed light for future studies and be taken as a reference providing insights on the characteristics of different types of honey for both local and worldwide producers.","Akgün, Nurettin; Çelik, Ömer Faruk; Kelebekli, Latif",Food Measure,279,5

Discussion: A 49-year-old female without any prior history of thyroid dysfunction presented with clinical and biochemical hyperthyroidism after a diagnosis of COVID-19 illness four months ago. At the time of thyroiditis diagnosis: free T4 was 1.52 ng/dL (normal, 0.76-1.46 ng/dL), TSH <0.005 uIU/mL (normal, 0.358-3.74 uIU/mL), Thyroglobulin antibodies 2 IU/mL (normal, <=1 IU/mL), TPO antibody 1 IU/mL (normal, <9 IU/mL), ESR 5 mm/hr (normal, 0-20 mm/hr). Thyroid US showed no nodules or evidence of autoimmune thyroid disease or abnormal vascular flow. A radioactive iodine uptake test was performed through the primary care office. The test demonstrated symmetric, uniform radiotracer uptake in the right and left lobe. 24-hour uptake was low at 0.1% (normal 15-25%) indicating thyroiditis. Patient features consistent with the diagnosis of subacute thyroiditis include suppressed TSH, diffuse tenderness on thyroid palpation, absent TPO/TG antibodies, and suppressed I-123 RAI uptake (<1%) on 24-hour scan. Conclusion: There is limited data surrounding thyroid disease and COVID-19. It has been suggested that a possible sequela of COVID-19 is thyroiditis. Physicians caring for recovering COVID-19 patients should be aware of possible painful subacute thyroiditis and to check thyroid studies in persons with symptoms of thyrotoxicosis post-COVID-19.","Bhargava, Pooja; Steenkamp, Devin Warren",J Endocr Soc,279,1

Unprecedented global demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) was complicated by limited availability and conflicting guidance from healthcare bodies. This study aimed to assess perceived confidence and knowledge of Public Health England’s PPE guidance amongst doctors of varying specialties and grades. METHOD: A nationwide 11-point survey comprising of multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and a Likert scale assessing perceived confidence (1=not confident, 5=very confident) was disseminated to U.K. based doctors using multiple platforms. RESULTS: Data collated from 697 respondents revealed average perceived confidence was low. Notably, 59% felt they had received insufficient education regarding up-to-date guidance, with 81% advocating further training. Anaesthetics and ophthalmology were the highest and lowest scoring specialties in knowledge based MCQs, achieving 59% and 31% respectively. Subsequent statistical analysis revealed significant differences between specialties."" CONCLUSIONS: Ensuring consistency in published PPE guidance and education can develop doctor’s confidence and knowledge of appropriate PPE use. The absence of a unified consensus and global education regarding the use of PPE poses significant ramifications for patient and healthcare professional (HCP) safety whilst risking further depletion of already sparse resources.","Al-Hity, S; Bhamra, N; Kumar, R; Gupta, K; Howard, J; Jolly, K; Darr, A",Br J Surg,279,26

Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is a promising tool for monitoring fluid status and FO. Therefore, we sought to investigate the efficacy of BIA-directed fluid resuscitation among OA patients. METHODS: A pragmatic, prospective, randomized, observer-blind, single-center trial was performed for all trauma patients requiring OA between January 2013 and December 2017 to a national referral center. A total of 140 postinjury OA patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either a BIA-directed fluid resuscitation (BIA) protocol that included fluid administration with monitoring of hemodynamic parameters and different degrees of interventions to achieve a negative fluid balance targeting the hydration level (HL) measured by BIA or a traditional fluid resuscitation (TRD) in which clinicians determined the fluid resuscitation regimen according to traditional parameters during 30 days of ICU management. The primary outcome was the 30-day primary fascial closure (PFC) rate. The secondary outcomes included the time to PFC, postoperative 7-day cumulative fluid balance (CFB) and adverse events within 30 days after OA. The Kaplan–Meier method and the log-rank test were utilized for PFC after OA. A generalized linear regression model for the time to PFC and CFB was built. RESULTS: A total of 134 patients completed the trial (BIA, n = 66; TRD, n = 68). The BIA patients were significantly more likely to achieve PFC than the TRD patients (83.33% vs. 55.88%, P < 0.001). In the BIA group, the time to PFC occurred earlier than that of the TRD group by an average of 3.66 days (P < 0.001). Additionally, the BIA group showed a lower postoperative 7-day CFB by an average of 6632.80 ml (P < 0.001) and fewer complications. CONCLUSION: Among postinjury OA patients in the ICU, the use of BIA-guided fluid resuscitation resulted in a higher PFC rate and fewer severe complications than the traditional fluid resuscitation strategy.

Accumulated evidence demonstrates a close association between increased level of HSP47 and excessive accumulation of collagen in fibrotic diseases. Our objective was to test ND-L02-s0201 efficacy in preclinical lung fibrosis models and characterise the downstream histological and functional consequences of inhibiting the expression of HSP47. Comprehensive optimisation and characterisation of bleomycin (BLM) and silica-induced rat lung fibrosis models were conducted, which ensured progressive pathological changes were sustained throughout the study during evaluation of the anti-fibrotic potential of ND-L02-s0201. In the BLM model, we demonstrated dose-dependent and statistically significant reduction in the relative lung weight, collagen deposition and histology, and fibrosis scores following ND-L02-s0201 treatment. Lung tissue mRNA profiling demonstrated that 11 out of 84 fibrosis-relevant genes were upregulated following BLM induction and were downregulated by approximately 4.5-fold following ND-L02-s0201 treatment. Epithelial–mesenchymal transition was characterised in the BLM model following ND-L02-s0201 treatment. Cell enrichment demonstrated that myofibroblasts contained the highest HSP47 mRNA expression. BLM led to more than a five-fold increase in myofibroblasts and ND-L02-s0201 treatment reduced the myofibroblasts to sham levels. Statistically significant improvement in lung function was noted in the BLM model which was determined by running endurance capacity using a 7-minute treadmill test. Comparable anti-fibrotic efficacy was also observed in the silica model. Results from two robust chronic rodent models of pulmonary fibrosis demonstrated significant anti-fibrotic effects and improved lung function which support the evaluation of ND-L02-s0201 in subjects with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.","Liu, Yun; Liu, Jian; Quimbo, Alistair; Xia, Fengcheng; Yao, Jiping; Clamme, Jean-Pierre; Zabludoff, Sonya; Zhang, Jun; Ying, Wenbin",ERJ Open Res,279,24

Furthermore, we examined the ACE2 levels in Calu3 cells (a lung cancer cell line) after triglyceride treatment, and the results indicated that ACE2 levels were increased at 25 μM and reached their peak at 200 μM. Finally, we found that the mRNA level of mthfd1 was significantly increased in the high-fat diet group.

The obtained compounds were structurally characterized by IR and NMR spectroscopy. The purity of all compounds was determined by HPLC and by elemental microanalysis. In addition, these compounds were evaluated for their in vitro antioxidant activity. Mechanisms of antioxidative activity were theoretically investigated by the density functional theory approach and the calculated values of various thermodynamic parameters, such as bond dissociation enthalpy, proton affinity, frontier molecular orbitals, and ionization potential. In silico calculations indicated that hydrogen atom transfer and sequential proton loss–electron transfer reaction mechanisms are probable, in non-polar and polar solvents respectively. Additionally, it was found that the single-electron transfer followed by proton transfer was not an operative mechanism in either solvent. The conducted tests indicate the excellent antioxidant activity, as well as the low potential toxicity, of the investigated compounds, which makes them good candidates for potential use in food chemistry.","Antonijević, Marko R.; Simijonović, Dušica M.; Avdović, Edina H.; Ćirić, Andrija; Petrović, Zorica D.; Marković, Jasmina Dimitrić; Stepanić, Višnja; Marković, Zoran S.",Antioxidants (Basel),279,1

The city is also the site of thriving municipal programs seeking to change food production and consumption outcomes through urban and peri-urban agriculture projects rooted in agroecology. This paper identifies the socio-natures critical for the formation and endurance of these agroecology assemblages. Based on interviews with 30 stakeholders in government, civil society, and agricultural production, we describe the integrated approach to environmental, social, and economic sustainability embedded in Rosario’s institutional agroecology programs. In particular, we discuss the actors and strategies (which seek to preserve land for agricultural uses), discursive renderings of socio-natures (as valuable biodiverse territories and productive diverse bodies), and the marketing of agroecological materialities (through production for public markets) that form and are formed by these assemblages. We also discuss the power dynamics embedded in sustaining urban and peri-urban agroecological projects through institutional means. This research contributes to literature on agroecology, urban agriculture, and the urban metabolism through providing empirical examples of socio-natural entanglements in urban agroecological assemblages.","Hammelman, Colleen; Shoffner, Elizabeth; Cruzat, Maria; Lee, Samantha",Agric Human Values,279,1

Results of the static analysis show that the level and slope of the yield curve are net transmitters of shocks to both the exchange rate and its volatility. The exchange rate of the Euro and the volatility of the Euro and the Canadian dollar exchange rate are net transmitters of shocks. Meanwhile, the curvature of the yield curve and the Japanese Yen, Swiss Franc, and British Pound act mainly as net receivers. Our static connectedness analysis shows that Bitcoin is mainly independent of shocks from the yield curve’s level, slope, and curvature, and from any main currency investigated. These findings hint that Bitcoin might provide hedging benefits. However, similar to the static analysis, our dynamic analysis shows that during different periods and particularly in stressful times, Bitcoin is far from being isolated from other currencies or the yield curve components. The dynamic analysis allows us to observe Bitcoin’s connectedness in times of stress. Evidence supporting this contention is the substantially increased connectedness due to policy shocks, political uncertainty, and systemic crisis, implying no empirical support for Bitcoin’s safe-haven property during stress times. The increased connectedness in the dynamic analysis compared with the static approach implies that in normal times and especially in stressful times, Bitcoin has the property of a diversifier. The results may have important implications for investors and policymakers regarding their risk monitoring and their assets allocation and investment strategies.","Aharon, David Y.; Umar, Zaghum; Vo, Xuan Vinh",Financ Innov,279,1

But, the techniques and algorithms are cumbersome and time-consuming. So, aiming at the problems of low efficiency, long running time, missing image detail information, and poor image fusion, the image fusion algorithm at pixel level based on edge detection is proposed. The improved ROEWA (Ratio of Exponentially Weighted Averages) operator is used to detect the edge of the image. The variable precision fitting algorithm and edge curvature change are used to extract the feature line of the image edge and edge angle point of the feature to improve the stability of image fusion. According to the information and characteristics of the high-frequency region and low-frequency region, different image fusion rules are set. To cope with the high-frequency area, the local energy weighted fusion approach based on edge information is utilized. The low-frequency region is processed by merging the region energy with the weighting factor, and the fusion results of the high findings demonstrate that the image fusion technique presented in this work increases the resolution by 1.23 and 1.01, respectively, when compared to the two standard approaches. When compared to the two standard approaches, the experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively reduce the lack of image information. The sharpness and information entropy of the fused image are higher than the experimental comparison method, and the running time is shorter and has better robustness.","Chen, Jiming; Chen, Liping; Shabaz, Mohammad",J Healthc Eng,279,1

Since then, other PCR panels for detection of several respiratory and gastrointestinal pathogens have been approved by the FDA and are commercially available, and more such panels are likely to become available. These assays detect 12 to 20 pathogens, and some include pathogens that typically cause different manifestations of infection, although they infect the same organ system. Some of these tests are labor-intensive, while others require little labor, and all of them are expensive, both for the laboratory and for the patient or insurer. They include a bundle of tests with limited or no options for selecting which tests will be performed. Laboratories and hospitals have adopted different strategies for offering these assays. Some have implemented strategies to limit the use of the tests, such as limiting the frequency with which patients can be tested, restricting testing to specific groups of patients (e.g., immunocompromised patients), or providing education to encourage the use of less expensive tests before using large multiplex panels. Others have offered these assays without limiting their use, either relying on the ordering provider to exercise good judgment or because such assays are thought to be appropriate for first-line diagnostic testing. In this Point-Counterpoint, Paul Schreckenberger of Loyola University Medical Center explains why his laboratory offers these assays without restriction. Alex McAdam of Boston's Children Hospital explains the concerns about the use of these assays as first-line tests and why some limitations on their use might be appropriate.","Schreckenberger, Paul C; McAdam, Alexander J",Journal of clinical microbiology,279,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS Sutures were prepared using standard techniques for sutured renorrhaphy during partial nephrectomy. Tested systems included knot/Hem-o-Lok®, Lapra-Ty®/Hem-o-Lok and Hem-o-Lok/Hem-o-Lok combinations. The saline filled tank was maintained at 37C. Vicryl®, Stratafix™ polyglycolic acid-polycaprolactone or V-Loc™ 180 sutures were suspended at 4 or 2 N. Suture material breakage or slippage was considered failure. RESULTS At 4 N 20% of sutures terminated with knot/Hem-o-Lok failed by 3 weeks compared to 56% and 100% terminated with Lapra-Ty/Hem-o-Lok and Hem-o-Lok/Hem-o-Lok, respectively (p <0.0001). The 55% and 100% of failures with Lapra-Ty/Hem-o-Lok and Hem-o-Lok/Hem-o-Lok, respectively, were generally due to slippage vs 11% with knot/Hem-o-Lok (p <0.0001). Overall failure rates with Lapra-Ty/Hem-o-Lok for zero to 4-zero sutures were 41% with Vicryl, 82% with polyglycolic acid-polycaprolactone and 24% with V-Loc 180 (p <0.0001). The only sutures without failure at 4 N with Lapra-Ty/Hem-o-Lok and knot/Hem-o-Lok closure systems were Vicryl zero, and V-Loc 2-zero and 3-zero. At 2 N Lapra-Ty/Hem-o-Lok failure (17.5% vs 0%, p = 0.039) and Hem-o-Lok/Hem-o-Lok failure (39% vs 16%, p = 0.074) were more common with polyglycolic acid-polycaprolactone than with V-Loc sutures. CONCLUSION Hem-o-Lok/Hem-o-Lok and Lapra-Ty/Hem-o-Lok combinations resulted in more frequent failures at 3 weeks or greater than knot/Hem-o-Lok. For all sutures tested knots were superior to Lapra-Tys to backstop Hem-o-Loks at 4 N. Preferably, Vicryl zero or V-Loc 2-zero/3-zero sutures should be used in combination with knots or Lapra-Tys at 4 N. Under these experimental conditions the Lapra-Ty/Hem-o-Lok combination did not reliably suspend the other sutures tested for 3 weeks. If Lapra-Ty/Hem-o-Lok or Hem-o-Lok/Hem-o-Lok combinations are used, we recommend closure at lesser tension and/or the use of appropriate sutures.","Gupta, Ruchir; Sunny, Nadia; Noyes, Sabrina L; Tourojman, Mouafak; Paka, Bikal; Bossemeyer, Robert; Lane, Brian R",The Journal of urology,279,16

Therefore, in this work nine metals and metalloids (Cu, Cd, Pb, Hg, Ni, Fe, Mn, Zn and As) and three nutrients (P, N and C) that seem to accumulate in marine sediments, were determined under the fish cages (zero distance) and about 50 and 100 m away from them, in three aquacultures in Greece. The analysis of these data is crucial due to the negative impact of the intensive aquaculture activities on fish population, human health and marine environment. This study investigated the environmental impact associated with aquaculture cages on marine sediments, using Supervised Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in parallel with Classification Trees (CTs). Optimised models were constructed in order to detect the significance of each variable, predict the origin of the sediment samples and successfully visualise their results. Three popular ANN architectures, as multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), radial basis function (RBF) and counter propagation artificial neural networks (CP-ANNs) were used to assess the impact of the intensive aquaculture activities on marine sediments. In addition, more traditional multivariate chemometric techniques like CTs were applied to the same data set for comparison purposes. The modelling study showed that P, N, Cu, Cd were the most critical (and polluting) factors of those metals studied. Moreover, single-element models achieved elevated predictive percentages. The results were justified due to the usual practices used for fish feeding or cages maintenance.","Farmaki, Eleni G; Thomaidis, Nikolaos S; Pasias, Ioannis N; Rousis, Nikolaos I; Baulard, Cecile; Papaharisis, Leonidas; Efstathiou, Constantinos E",The Science of the total environment,279,9

Therefore monitoring pollen levels in ambient air is an important tool in research and health care. Most European monitoring stations collect airborne pollen at rooftop levels for measurements in the larger surrounding of the sampling station, and not in the direct environment of sensitized subjects. Here we present the development and evaluation of a portable pollen sampler, called ""Pollensniffer"", that was designed to collect pollen in the immediate environment of allergic subjects. Validation of the Pollensniffer against the standard volumetric pollen sampler showed for most pollen types high correlations between the number of pollen collected by those two devices (Spearman's Correlation Coefficient > 0.8); the Pollensniffer appeared to collect on average 5.8 times more pollen per hour than the static sampler. Pollen monitoring was performed using this Pollensniffer at street level at 3 different locations in the city of Leiden during 22 weeks in 2017 and 21 weeks in 2018, during three 15-min periods a day and at one day in the week. The results showed that the pollen levels for birch and grass pollen can significantly differ from location to location and per time of day. Furthermore, the Pollensniffer measurements at street level showed that birch and grass pollen grains were detected 1 1/2 and 2-3 weeks, respectively, before detection at rooftop level. The street measurements show that allergic subjects can encounter varying pollen levels throughout the city and that they can be exposed to grass and birch pollen and may experience hay fever symptoms, even before the sampler at rooftop level registers these pollen.","de Weger, Letty A; Molster, Frank; de Raat, Kevin; den Haan, Jeffrey; Romein, Johan; van Leeuwen, Willem; de Groot, Hans; Mostert, Marijke; Hiemstra, Pieter S",The Science of the total environment,279,5

We investigated whether the creation of an intestinal stenosis could alter the severity of the expected Crohn-like ileitis, in a Crohn's disease animal model, the TNFΔare/+ mouse. METHODS Thirty-six, 6-weeks-old TNFΔare/+ mice, were divided into 3 intervention groups: triple suture, single suture and sham. In the terminal ileum, in the first group, a triple suture stenosis was created, whereas, in the second, a loose suture was placed. Same triple-suture stenosis was performed on twelve wild type mice. All animals were sacrificed at 6 weeks post-operatively and the ileum parts were evaluated histopathologically. A summative total ileitis score was applied in each sample using a bespoke semiquantitative histological scoring system for the Crohn-like changes. RESULTS The triple suture stenosis induced significant muscular hypertrophy proximal to interventional site which was more prominent in TNFΔare/+ than wild type mice. In triple suture group, the total ileitis score was significantly increased proximal to the intervention as compared to the single suture (P: 0.004) and the sham groups (P: 0.013). The total ileitis score distally, was unaffected, regardless of the experimental intervention. Intestinal stenosis did not induce intestinal inflammation in wild type mice. CONCLUSION The creation of a stenosis in the terminal ileum of TNFΔare/+ mice alters Crohn-like inflammation. We assume that mechanical forces, such as intraluminal pressure, may contribute as important co-factors to the pathophysiology of Crohn's disease in genetically predisposed subjects.","Georgopoulos, Ioannis; Mavrigiannaki, Eleftheria; Stasinopoulou, Sotiria; Renieris, Georgios; Nikolakis, Georgios; Bamias, Giorgos; Tiniakos, Dina; Papaconstantinou, Ioannis",Digestive diseases and sciences,279,24

The current study was aimed to develop a new rabbit bullous keratopathy model using corneal endothelial cells that were induced to undergo endothelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT). EMT was induced in rabbit corneal endothelial cells (RCECs) by culturing with TGFβ and basic FGF Supplemented Medium. The corneal endothelia in recipient rabbits were mechanically scraped from the corneal endothelial surface inside an 8 mm mark. Then, a suspension of EMT-induced RCECs (EMT-RCECs) was injected into the anterior chamber. Eyes injected with freshly isolated RCECs (Fresh RCECs group) and eyes that were scraped without injection of cells (Scrape group) were used as controls. Immediately following operation, subepithelial and stromal edema was observed with increased central corneal thickness and corneal opacity in all groups. In the EMT-RCECs group, bullous keratopathy persisted for 42 days up to the end of the study. In the Fresh-RCECs and Scrape groups, corneal transparency and thickness recovered by 7 days after treatment and was maintained up to 42 days. The activated fibroblast marker, α-SMA, was observed spanning from corneal endothelium to corneal stroma in the EMT-RCECs group. Interestingly, α-SMA was upregulated in the Scrape-group as well. In all groups, there was no damage to other intraocular structures, and intraocular pressure was normal throughout the observation period. Transplanting a fresh donor cornea effectively treated corneal edema due to bullous keratopathy. This model is a promising tool for pre-clinical trials in the development of new therapies against corneal endothelial dysfunction.","Yamashita, Kazuya; Hatou, Shin; Inagaki, Emi; Higa, Kazunari; Tsubota, Kazuo; Shimmura, Shigeto",Scientific reports,279,25

An open cystgastrostomy is an effective treatment option particularly for larger, solid predominant collections. A laparoscopic cystgastrostomy (LCG) as initially described, could be technically challenging. This report describes the evolution of the operative technique and the results from LCG in a tertiary referral centre. METHODS Retrospective analysis of the unit's prospectively populated database was conducted. All patients who underwent a surgical cystgastrostomy (SCG) were identified. Patient demographics, outcome and complications were collected and analysed. RESULTS Forty-four patients underwent SCG: 8 open and 36 laparoscopic. Of the 36 LCG, 6 required open conversion, although with evolution of the technique all of the last 17 cases were completed laparoscopically. The median interquartile range (IQR) length of stay in patients completed laparoscopically was 6 (2-10) compared with 15.5 days (8-19) in those patients who were converted (P = 0.0351). The only peri-operative complication after a LCG was a self-limiting upper gastrointestinal bleed. With a median (IQR) follow-up of 891 days (527-1495) one patient required re-intervention for a residual collection with no recurrent collections identified. CONCLUSION LCG is a safe and effective procedure in patients with large, solid predominant PAPCs. With increased experience and technical expertise conversion rates can be lowered and outcome optimized.","Gibson, Simon C; Robertson, Bernard F; Dickson, Euan J; McKay, Colin J; Carter, C Ross",HPB : the official journal of the International Hepato Pancreato Biliary Association,279,25

No prevention strategy specifically addresses this period. METHODS We conducted a multicenter, two-group, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in nine hospitals in Kenya and Uganda to determine whether 3 months of malaria chemoprevention could reduce morbidity and mortality after hospital discharge in children younger than 5 years of age who had been admitted with severe anemia. All children received standard in-hospital care for severe anemia and a 3-day course of artemether-lumefantrine at discharge. Two weeks after discharge, children were randomly assigned to receive dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (chemoprevention group) or placebo, administered as 3-day courses at 2, 6, and 10 weeks after discharge. Children were followed for 26 weeks after discharge. The primary outcome was one or more hospital readmissions for any reason or death from the time of randomization to 6 months after discharge. Conditional risk-set modeling for recurrent events was used to calculate hazard ratios with the use of the Prentice-Williams-Peterson total-time approach. RESULTS From May 2016 through May 2018, a total of 1049 children underwent randomization; 524 were assigned to the chemoprevention group and 525 to the placebo group. From week 3 through week 26, a total of 184 events of readmission or death occurred in the chemoprevention group and 316 occurred in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.54 to 0.78; P<0.001). The lower incidence of readmission or death in the chemoprevention group than in the placebo group was restricted to the intervention period (week 3 through week 14) (hazard ratio, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.22 to 0.42) and was not sustained after that time (week 15 through week 26) (hazard ratio, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.87 to 1.47). No serious adverse events were attributed to dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. CONCLUSIONS In areas with intense malaria transmission, 3 months of postdischarge malaria chemoprevention with monthly dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine in children who had recently received treatment for severe anemia prevented more deaths or readmissions for any reason after discharge than placebo.

The authors adapted the June Objective Standardized Clinical Examination (OSCE) to a telehealth OSCE to preserve live faculty observation of students' skills and immediate feedback dialogue between students, standardized patients, and faculty members. The authors assessed students' reactions and comparative performance. Materials and Methods: OSCE and telehealth educators used draft Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) telehealth competencies to create educational materials and adapt OSCE cases. Students anonymously answered queries about the challenges of the telehealth encounters, confidence in basic telehealth competencies, and educational value of the experience. Cohort-level performance data were compared between the January in-person and June telehealth OSCEs. Results: One hundred sixty students participated in 29 Zoom® two-case telehealth OSCEs, equaling 58 h of assessment time. Survey response rate: 59%. Students indicated moderate challenge in adapting physical examinations to the telehealth format and indicated it to be cognitively challenging. Confidence in telehealth competencies was rated ""moderate"" to ""very,"" but was most pronounced for the technical aspects of telehealth, rather than safety engagement with a patient. Although authors found no significant difference in cohort-level performance in total scores and history-taking between the OSCEs, physical examination and communication scores differed between the two assessments. Discussion: It was feasible to adapt a standardized OSCE to a telehealth format when in-person clinical skills assessment was impossible. Students rated this necessary innovation positively, and it adequately assessed foundational clinical skills performance. Conclusion: Given future competency needs in telehealth, we suggest several education and training priorities.","Farrell, Susan E; Junkin, Andrew R; Hayden, Emily M",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,279,1

The Physician Response Unit (PRU) is a Community Emergency Medicine model, working closely with community, hospital and pre-hospital services. In response to the pandemic, the PRU has been able to rapidly introduce novel pathways designed to support local emergency departments (EDs) and local emergency patients. The pathways are (1) supporting discharge from acute medical and older people's services wards into the community; (2) supporting acute oncology services; (3) supporting EDs; (4) supporting palliative care services. Establishing these pathways have facilitated a number of vulnerable patients to access patient-focussed and holistic definitive emergency care. The pathways have also allowed EDs to safely discharge patients to the community, and also mitigate some of the problems associated with trying to maintain isolation for vulnerable patients within the ED. Community Emergency Medicine models are able to reduce ED attendances and hospital admissions, and hence risk of crowding, as well as reducing nosocomial risks for patients who can have high-quality emergency care brought to them.

METHODS COVID-19 daily death counts for 1,976 US nonmetropolitan counties for the period March 2-July 26, 2020, were extracted from USAFacts and merged with county-level American Community Survey and Area Health Resource File data. Covariates included county percent poverty, age composition, adjacency to a metropolitan county, health care supply, and state fixed effects. Mixed-effects negative binomial regression with random intercepts to account for repeated observations within counties were used to predict differences in the average daily increase in the COVID-19 mortality rate across quartiles of percent Black and percent Hispanic. FINDINGS Since early March, the average daily increase in the COVID-19 mortality rate has been significantly higher in rural counties with the highest percent Black and percent Hispanic populations. Compared to counties in the bottom quartile, counties in the top quartile of percent Black have an average daily increase that is 70% higher (IRR = 1.70, CI: 1.48-1.95, P < .001), and counties in the top quartile of percent Hispanic have an average daily increase that is 50% higher (IRR = 1.50, CI: 1.33-1.69, P < .001), net of covariates. CONCLUSION COVID-19 mortality risk is not distributed equally across the rural United States, and the COVID-19 race penalty is not restricted to cities.

Results of an interview-based observational study.,19.39324,4.589152,2021-06-02,"BACKGROUND There is increasing evidence that the individual physician is the main factor influencing variability in end-of-life decision-making in intensive care units. End-of-life decisions are complex and should be adapted to each patient. Physician-related variability is problematic as it may result in unequal assessments that affect patient outcomes. The primary aim of this study was to investigate factors contributing to physician-related variability in end-of-life decision-making. METHOD This is a qualitative sub-study of a previously conducted study. In-depth thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews with 19 critical care specialists from five different Swedish intensive care units was performed. Interviews took place between February 1, 2017, and May 31, 2017. RESULTS Factors influencing physician-related variability consisted of different assessment of patient preferences, as well as intensivists' personality and values. Personality was expressed mainly through pace and determination in the decision-making process. Personal prejudices appeared in decisions, but few respondents had personally witnessed this. Avoidance of criticism and conflicts as well as individual strategies for emotional coping were other factors that influenced physician-related variability. Many respondents feared criticism for making their assessments, and the challenging nature of end-of-life decision-making lead to avoidance as well as emotional stress. CONCLUSION Variability in end-of-life decision-making is an important topic that needs further investigation. It is imperative that such variability be acknowledged and addressed in a more formal and transparent manner. The ethical issues faced by intensivists have recently been compounded by the devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrating in profound terms the importance of the topic.","Nordenskjöld Syrous, Alma; Malmgren, Johan; Odenstedt Hergès, Helena; Olausson, Sepideh; Kock-Redfors, Maria; Ågård, Anders; Block, Linda",Acta anaesthesiologica Scandinavica,279,0

MATERIALS AND METHODS Data were collected retrospectively between September 2009 and May 2019. Electronic medical records were reviewed for baseline characteristics, treatment details and outcomes. All patients were treated according to local protocol based on the national UK SABR Consortium guidelines. Risk-adapted treatment schedules were used depending on the size and the location of the tumour (54 Gy in three fractions, 55 Gy in five fractions, 60 Gy in eight fractions or 50 Gy in 10 fractions). Overall survival outcomes were evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS In total, 412 patients were included in the analysis. The median age was 76 years (range 48-93 years). Histological confirmation was obtained in 233 cases (56.6%). The median overall survival for all patients was 42.3 months (95% confidence interval 37.3-47.3 months), with 3- and 5-year overall survival of 52.8% and 37.3%, respectively. For biopsy-proven patients (56.6%), 3- and 5-year overall survival was 57.3% and 40.1%, respectively. With respect to overall survival, univariate and multivariate analysis revealed no significant difference in survival by technique (volume-modulated arc therapy versus conformal; three-dimensional computed tomography versus four-dimensional computed tomography), tumour location, smoking status at first contact, pre-treatment tumour stage or pre-treatment standardised uptake value. Survival was poorer for patients who received the 50 Gy in 10 fractions schedule. Treatment was very well tolerated with very low rates of grade 3-4 toxicity (1%). CONCLUSIONS SABR for peripherally located, medically inoperable non-small cell lung cancer can be safely and effectively implemented in a non-academic institution with appropriate equipment and training. Overall survival outcomes and toxicity rates are comparable with internationally published studies. Patients treated with 50 Gy in 10 fractions had a poorer survival outcome.","Wood, A; Aynsley, E; Kumar, G; Masinghe, S; Anderson, M; Veeratterapillay, J; Huntley, C; Blower, A; Green, J; Johnson, D; Daniel, J; Curtis, H; Reynolds, J; Turnbull, M; Harland, K; Swingler, A; Banham, E; Burke, K; Bradley, J; Greenhalgh, A; Peedell, C",Clinical oncology (Royal College of Radiologists (Great Britain)),279,1

Inflammatory insult owing to pathogenic factors plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis. Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) can affect the infiltration of immune cells in many pathology processes of diseases, but its role in liver fibrosis has not been elucidated completely. Here, the markedly elevated protein IDO1 in livers was identified, and dendritic cells (DCs) immune-phenotypes were significantly altered after BDL challenge. A distinct hepatic population of CD11c+DCs was decreased and presented an immature immune-phenotype, reflected by lower expression levels of co-stimulatory molecules (CD40, MHCII). Frequencies of CD11c+CD80+, CD11c+CD86+, CD11c+MHCII+, and CD11c+CD40+ cells in splenic leukocytes were reduced significantly. Notably, IDO1 overexpression inhibited hepatic, splenic CD11c+DCs maturation, mature DCs-mediated T-cell proliferation and worsened liver fibrosis, whereas above pathological phenomena were reversed in IDO1-/- mice. Our data demonstrate that IDO1 affects the process of immune cells recruitment via inhibiting DCs maturation and subsequent T cells proliferation, resulting in the promotion of hepatic fibrosis. Thus, amelioration of immune responses in hepatic and splenic microenvironment by targeting IDO1 might be essential for the therapeutic effects on liver fibrosis.","Mo, Chan; Xie, Shuwen; Liu, Bin; Zhong, Weichao; Zeng, Ting; Huang, Sha; Lai, Yuqi; Deng, Guanghui; Zhou, Chuying; Yan, Weixin; Chen, Yuyao; Huang, Shaohui; Gao, Lei; Lv, Zhiping",Cell death & disease,279,31

The weight of negative LNs in an inverse lymph node ratio (nR) should be related to its prognostic impact. Five hundred and two consecutive gastric cancer patients, who underwent radical gastrectomy, were included. Patients were split into groups according to the number of harvested nodes and a cross-tabulation with pTNM stages was performed to test differences in the tumor burden. pN+ patients (n = 296) were split into groups of negative LNs harvested. We tested an alternative formula for computing a lymph node ratio: nR = total number of harvested nodes/total number of positive nodes. The median number of negative LNs was significantly different (p < 0.01) between dissection groups, but not the median of positive nodes (p > 0.05). No difference in pTNM percentage distribution was found between these groups (p > 0.05). When tested, the overall survival improved significantly for groups with larger numbers of negative LNs (p < 0.001). A cutoff of nR ≥ 6 was an independent prognostic factor for survival (p = 0.001), and the survival of pN+ patients with nR ≥ 6 was not different from pN0 patients. The impact of the number of negative LNs on the survival of the pN+ patients was demonstrated. The higher numbers in the numerator of the nR was due to the disproportion between harvested negative LNs and metastatic LNs. Larger ratios imply more negative lymph nodes in relation to positive lymph nodes, which was significantly associated with survival. We believe that the proposed nR is a friendlier to use format because of its intuitive interpretation.","da Costa, Paulo Matos; Lages, Patrícia; Onofre, Susana; Ribeiro, Ruy M",Updates in surgery,279,7

We aimed to systematically determine and quantify the potential association between dietary anthocyanin intake and risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). A systematic literature search of studies reporting anthocyanin intake and risk of fatal or nonfatal CVD was performed using SCOPUS, MEDLINE, CINAHL and Cochrane Library. The relative risk (RR) or hazard ratio (HR) of highest category of anthocyanin foods were pooled in a random-effects meta-analysis. Subgroup analysis were conducted to determine possible sources of heterogeneity. The meta-analysis suggested intake of dietary anthocyanins and reduced risk of CHD (RR = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.83, 0.99; I2 = 12.0, Ph = 0.337) and CVD mortality (RR = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.87, 0.97; I2 = 0.0, Ph = 0.584). However, there was no relationship between the intake of these compounds and reduced risk of MI, stroke or total CVD. Subgroup analysis determined reduced risk of CHD and CVD mortality was more prominent for anthocyanidin intake, as opposed to anthocyanin or berries. Our systematic review and meta-analysis provides evidence that anthocyanins, specifically anthocyanidins, reduce the risk of CHD and CVD mortality. Further randomized controlled trials on anthocyanin intake and CVD risk factors are needed to support these findings.","Kimble, Rachel; Keane, Karen M; Lodge, John K; Howatson, Glyn",Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,279,14

However, it is reasonable to admit that, as it was not found any advantage of corticosteroid therapy in so diverse conditions, such beneficial effects do not exist at all. Its administration is likely to increase overall mortality and such trend is consistent regardless of the quality as well as the sample size of studies. Moreover it was shown that corticosteroids might be associated with higher incidence of hospital-acquired pneumonia and longer duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay.

To infect mice, mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) has evolved to recognize mouse CEACAM1a (mCEACAM1a) as its receptor. To elude MHV infections, mice may have evolved a variant allele from the Ceacam1a gene, called Ceacam1b, producing mCEACAM1b, which is a much poorer MHV receptor than mCEACAM1a. Previous studies showed that sequence differences between mCEACAM1a and mCEACAM1b in a critical MHV-binding CC' loop partially account for the low receptor activity of mCEACAM1b, but detailed structural and molecular mechanisms for the differential MHV receptor activities of mCEACAM1a and mCEACAM1b remained elusive. Here we have determined the crystal structure of mCEACAM1b and identified the structural differences and additional residue differences between mCEACAM1a and mCEACAM1b that affect MHV binding and entry. These differences include conformational alterations of the CC' loop as well as residue variations in other MHV-binding regions, including β-strands C' and C'' and loop C'C''. Using pseudovirus entry and protein-protein binding assays, we show that substituting the structural and residue features from mCEACAM1b into mCEACAM1a reduced the viral receptor activity of mCEACAM1a, whereas substituting the reverse changes from mCEACAM1a into mCEACAM1b increased the viral receptor activity of mCEACAM1b. These results elucidate the detailed molecular mechanism for how mice may have kept pace in the evolutionary arms race with MHV by undergoing structural and residue changes in the MHV receptor, providing insight into this possible example of pathogen-driven evolution of a host receptor protein.","Peng, Guiqing; Yang, Yang; Pasquarella, Joseph R; Xu, Liqing; Qian, Zhaohui; Holmes, Kathryn V; Li, Fang",The Journal of biological chemistry,279,25

PROCEDURES Twenty consecutive patients with advanced prostate cancer underwent bone scintigraphy, followed by Ga-68-DOTATOC PET/CT within 3 weeks. Through side-by-side comparison with bone scintigraphy, the number of visible bone metastases on PET was determined. In addition, in cases of visible metastases, the maximum standard uptake value (SUV(max)) of Ga-68-DOTATOC was measured in the metastases and in normal bone. In patients who did not undergo a prostatectomy (n = 12), the SUV(max) was additionally measured in the prostate and in adjacent tissue. For focal lesions, the difference in SUV(max) (Delta SUV(max)) between the metastases and normal bone was calculated. For patients still having their prostate, a Delta SUV(max) between the prostate and its adjacent tissue was calculated. RESULTS Sixty four of 216 metastases (30%) were visible in 13 patients with focal metastases. Of six patients with diffuse metastases (superscan), one showed diffuse metastases, three showed a total of ten focal metastases, and two showed no correlate on PET. One patient with a neuroendocrine prostate cancer showed no correlate on PET. The maximum Delta SUV(max) between metastases and normal bone was 4.9 (mean = 1.6 +/- 0.9) and between the prostate and adjacent tissue 5.9 (mean = 2.8 +/- 1.6). CONCLUSIONS In prostate cancer and its bone metastases, DOTATOC-affine somatostatin receptors (subtype 2 and 5) can be visualized with Ga-68-DOTATOC PET/CT. But their expression is so weak that other conjugates should be tested for receptor-mediated therapies which are better at addressing the prostate cancer-specific somatostatin receptor subtypes 1 and 4-or even other receptors.","Luboldt, Wolfgang; Zöphel, Klaus; Wunderlich, Gerd; Abramyuk, Andrij; Luboldt, Hans-Joachim; Kotzerke, Joerg",Molecular imaging and biology : MIB : the official publication of the Academy of Molecular Imaging,279,27

METHODS Computer models were used to simulate RFA with a 3-cm Cool-tip applicator and MWA with an Amica-Gen applicator. The Arrhenius model was used to compute the damage index (Ω). CZ was considered when Ω > 4.6 (>99% of damaged cells). Regions with 0.6<Ω < 2.1 were considered as the PZ (tissue that has undergone moderate sub-ablative hyperthermia). The ratio of PZ volume to CZ volume (PZ/CZ) was regarded as a measure of performance, since a low value implies achieving a large CZ while keeping the PZ small. RESULTS Ten-min RFA (51 W) created smaller periablational zones than 10-min MWA (11.3 cm3 vs. 17.2-22.9 cm3, for 60-100 W MWA, respectively). Prolonging duration from 5 to 10 min increased the PZ in MWA more than in RFA (2.7 cm3 for RFA vs. 8.3-11.9 cm3 for 60-100 W MWA, respectively). PZ/CZ for RFA were relatively high (65-69%), regardless of ablation time, while those for MWA were highly dependent on the duration (increase of up to 25% between 5 and 10 min) and on the applied power (smaller values as power was raised, 102% for 60 W vs. 81% for 100 W, both for 10 min). The lowest PZ/CZ across all settings was 56%, obtained with 100 W-5 min MWA. CONCLUSIONS Although RFA creates smaller periablational zones than MWA, 100 W-5 min MWA provides the lowest PZ/CZ.","Trujillo, Macarena; Prakash, Punit; Faridi, Pegah; Radosevic, Aleksandar; Curto, Sergio; Burdio, Fernando; Berjano, Enrique","International journal of hyperthermia : the official journal of European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology, North American Hyperthermia Group",279,9

The main adverse event of EST is bleeding and perforation and that of EPBD is post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) pancreatitis. To reduce these adverse events we employed minimal EST followed by papillary dilation (ESBD), and retrospectively evaluated its efficacy and safety compared with EST. Patients and Methods CBDS patients who underwent EST (n = 114) or ESBD (n = 321) at Juntendo University Hospital from January 2009 to December 2018 were consecutively enrolled, retrospectively. The exclusion criteria were large-balloon dilation (≥ 12 mm), large CBDS (>12 mm), and previous EST/EPBD. We compared the overall stone removal rate, incidence of adverse event, procedure time, number of ERCP procedures, and rate of mechanical lithotripsy (ML) between the two groups. Results Complete stone removal was successful in both ESBD and EST group. However, the rate of multiple ERCP sessions was significantly lower (35.1% vs. 12.8%, P < 0.001), procedure time was shorter (31.6 vs. 25.8 min, P = 0.01), and rate of ML was lower (16.7% vs. 7.8%, P = 0.01) in ESBD group. Bleeding was significantly more frequent in the EST group (9.6% vs. 1.2%, P < 0.001), particularly acute bleeding (7.9% vs. 0.9%, P < 0.001). Conclusions ESBD is more efficient and safer in the management of CBD stones than EST.

AIM To assess which of the four considered SADs takes the shortest time and the lowest number of attempts to be correctly placed. The secondary aim was to evaluate the influence of some characteristics of the study population on time taken and number of attempts required. METHODS A crossover trial was conducted at the Advanced Medical Simulation Center of the University of Perugia (Italy) between June and September 2017. Eighty-three nurses were enrolled in the study. Each participant was asked to place four different SADs in a manikin: Laryngeal Tube Suction-D (LTS-D), i-gel™, Ambu® Laryngeal Mask AuraGain™ and LMA® Protector™ Cuff Pilot™. RESULTS The median insertion time for the different devices was: 8.0 seconds (s) for LTS-D, 6.0 s for i-gel, 5.4 s for AuraGain, 5.8 s for LMA Protector (p<0.05); the median number of insertion attempts was: 2 for LTS-D, 1 for i-gel, AuraGain and LMA Protector (p<0.05). There was no significant relationship between insertion time and attempts required and the participants' working experience, training, or knowledge of the devices.

Microsurgical clipping or wrapping and/or use of traditional endovascular techniques to repair the lesion result in frequent regrowth and rebleeds and ultimately high fatality rates. Because of the purely endoluminal nature of arterial reconstruction, flow diversion may represent an ideal option to repair ruptured BAs. METHODS We performed a retrospective analysis of our database including all consecutive patients with aSAH secondary to BAs treated with the Pipeline Embolic Device (PED) between November 2013 and November 2015 in two institutions. We collected basic patient demographics, aneurysm size, location, number and sizes of PEDs used, use of coiling, 30-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score, and follow-up imaging data. RESULTS Ten cases of aSAH were found as a result of a ruptured BA. Patients had a mean age of 47.2 years (range 27-68). Mean Hunt and Hess score was 1.6 (range 1-4). Lesions were predominantly left-sided, mostly along the dorsal aspect of the internal carotid artery, either paraclinoid or paraophthalmic (8/10). In two patients the BA was located in the left middle cerebral artery. All lesions were very small (mean 1.4×1.5 mm; range 0.75-2.1 mm). Placement of a single PED resulted in immediate occlusion or near-occlusion of the BA in 9 out of 10 patients. Nine patients did very well; eight had a 90-day mRS score of 0 and one had a 90-day mRS score of 1. Follow-up digital subtraction angiography was performed in all patients (mean 15 months; range 7-24). In the surviving nine patients there was complete occlusion of the BA on long-term follow-up angiography.

The aim of this study was to compare early outcomes of single-port colectomy with those of conventional laparoscopic colectomy. METHOD All consecutive patients undergoing single-port colectomy between January and June 2010 were identified from a prospective database. They were matched for age, sex, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiology score and type of resection with patients who had conventional laparoscopic colectomy. All perioperative data, analgesic requirement, pain scores and inflammatory response were compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank and McNemar tests. RESULTS Fourteen patients [five men, nine women; median age (interquartile range) 56 (30-73) years, body mass index (interquartile range) 22 (20-24) kg/m2] underwent single-port colectomy and were matched with patients who had conventional laparoscopic colectomy. Median operating times, estimated blood loss, pain scores, analgesic requirement, inflammatory response and length of hospital stay were similar. Median increase in incision length was significantly higher in the single-port group (P=0.004), but maximal incision length for specimen extraction was comparable. There were no anastomotic leaks, wound infections or 30-day readmissions. CONCLUSION In a case-matched setting with a small sample size, single-port laparoscopic colectomy has comparable outcomes to conventional laparoscopic colectomy.","Wolthuis, A M; Penninckx, F; Fieuws, S; D'Hoore, A",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,279,1

DESIGN AND SETTING A randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, cross-over feasibility trial in Melbourne, Australia. INTERVENTIONS After two-week run-in participants were randomized to either ZS (encapsulated granules; 2 g daily) or placebo for four weeks. After four-weeks wash-out, participants swapped to the other treatment for four weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Sleep quality assessed by the Insomnia Severity Index and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Quality of life, mood, functional impairment and sleep parameters were also assessed. RESULTS Twelve participants were randomized and completed both periods of cross-over (six in each sequence). Feasibility endpoints were acceptable. Improvements for sleep quality measured on the PSQI were statistically significant during the ZS treatment periods compared to placebo (t = -2.276, df = 10, 95% CI -3.3 to -0.04, p = 0.046). There was no evidence of any significant carryover effects. However, there were period effects. Other outcomes showed no statistically significant difference between the treatments. Subjective sleep parameters measured on sleep diaries showed improvements after ZS in terms of total sleep time, sleep efficiency and sleep onset latency, but not after placebo. ZS was well tolerated with only minor adverse events. CONCLUSIONS ZS is an acceptable and well-tolerated herbal candidate for the treatment of insomnia. The feasibility objectives of this study were achieved and ZS improved both subjective sleep quality and quantity compared to placebo. ZS should be explored in future clinical trials.","Shergis, Johannah L; Hyde, Anna; Meaklim, Hailey; Varma, Prerna; Da Costa, Cliff; Jackson, Melinda L",Complementary therapies in medicine,279,27

Whether the newer hybrid mode using target tidal volume noninvasive ventilation (target V(T) NIV) provides additional benefits remains unclear. METHODS Subjects with COPD successfully established on long-term HI-NIV were switched to target V(T) NIV. Optimal target V(T) settings according to nocturnal transcutaneous P(CO2) measurements were achieved following a randomized crossover trial using 8 mL/kg ideal body weight and 110% of individual V(T) during HI-NIV, respectively. The following parameters were compared at the beginning of the trial while subjects were on HI-NIV, and after 3 months on optimal target V(T) NIV: sleep quality by polysomnography, overnight gas exchange, subjects' tolerance, overnight pneumotachygraphic measurements during NIV, health-related quality of life (severe respiratory insufficiency questionnaire), exercise capacity (6-min walk test), and lung function. RESULTS Ten of 14 subjects completed the study. There were no differences between HI-NIV and target V(T) NIV in any of the above-mentioned parameters. Specifically, the mean overnight transcutaneous P(CO2) was equivalent under each form of ventilation (both 45 ± 5 mm Hg, P = .75). CONCLUSIONS Switching subjects from well-established HI-NIV to target V(T) NIV shows no clinical benefits in chronic hypercapnic COPD. In particular, sleep quality, the control of nocturnal hypoventilation, daytime hypercapnia, overnight ventilation patterns, subjects' tolerance, health-related quality of life, lung function, and exercise capability were all similar in subjects who underwent HI-NIV and target V(T) NIV. Nevertheless, target V(T) NIV might offer some physiological advantages in breathing pattern and might be beneficial in some individual patients.

Micronesians, mostly Chuukese and Marshallese, were the most severely affected. Disproportionate COVID-19 infection in racial or ethnic groups in the US occur because of socioeconomic factors. The COVID-19 pandemic can be thought of as a syndemic-where cases cluster ""on a background of social and economic disparity"". In this brief report, we describe factors that put Chuukese and Marshallese at increased risk for COVID-19 in Hawaii. We show that Micronesians had increased risk for COVID-19 due to limited employment opportunities, housing insecurity, and underlying comorbid conditions in the context of rescinded federal health insurance and broken government promises. We also highlight the resiliency that many community members demonstrated in preventing new infections and supporting those infected. We conclude that COVID-19 in Hawaii should be understood as a syndemic, where Micronesians were disproportionately affected due to disparities in housing, employment, and health access.

We aimed to describe a clinical picture of delayed leukoencephalopathy and explore potential associations with procedural characteristics. MATERIALS AND METHODS We considered endovascular coiling procedures for cerebral aneurysms performed between January 2006 and December 2017 in our institution with follow-up MRIs. We used logistic regression models to estimate the ORs of delayed leukoencephalopathy for each procedural characteristic. RESULTS We reviewed 1754 endovascular coiling procedures of 1594 aneurysms. Sixteen of 1722 (0.9%) procedures demonstrated delayed leukoencephalopathy on follow-up FLAIR MR imaging examinations after a median period of 71.5 days (interquartile range, 30-101 days) in the form of high-signal changes in the white matter at locations remote from the coil mass. Seven patients had headaches or hemiparesis, and 9 patients were asymptomatic. All imaging-associated changes improved subsequently. We found indications suggesting an association between delayed leukoencephalopathy and the number of microcatheters used per procedure (P = .009), along with indications suggesting that these procedures required larger median volumes of contrast medium (225 versus 175 mL, OR = 5.5, P = .008) as well as a longer median fluoroscopy duration (123.6 versus 99.3 minutes, OR = 3.0, P = .06). Our data did not suggest that delayed leukoencephalopathy was associated with the number of coils (P = .57), microguidewires (P = .35), and guiding systems (P = .57). CONCLUSIONS Delayed leukoencephalopathy after coiling of cerebral aneurysms may have multiple etiologies such as foreign body emboli, contrast-induced encephalopathy, or hypersensitivity reaction to foreign bodies.","Ikemura, A; Ishibashi, T; Otani, K; Yuki, I; Kodama, T; Kan, I; Kato, N; Murayama, Y",AJNR.

The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) has recommended clinicians discuss costs of cancer care with patients to enhance shared decision-making. We sought information to guide oncologists' discussions with patients about these costs. METHODS We searched Medline, EMBASE and clinical practice guideline databases from January 2009 to 1 June 2019 for recommendations about discussing the costs of care and financial burden. Guideline quality was assessed with the AGREE-II instrument. RESULTS Twenty-seven guidelines met our eligibility criteria, including 16 from ASCO (59%). 21 of 27 (78%) guidelines included recommendations about discussion or consideration of treatment costs when prescribing, with information about actual costs in four (15%). Recognition of the risk of financial burden or financial toxicity was described in 81% (22/27) of guidelines. However, only nine guidelines (33%) included information about managing the financial burden. CONCLUSIONS Current clinical practice guidelines have little information to guide physician-patient discussions about costs of anticancer treatment and management of financial burden. This limits patients' ability to control costs of treatment, and for the healthcare team to reduce the incidence and severity of financial burden. Current guidelines recommend clinician awareness of price variability and high costs of treatment. Clinicians are recommended to explore cost concerns and address financial worries, especially in high risk groups. Future guidelines should include advice on facilitating cost transparency discussions, with provision of cost information and resources.","Agarwal, Anupriya; Livingstone, Ann; Karikios, Deme J; Stockler, Martin R; Beale, Philip J; Morton, Rachael L",BMC cancer,279,19

MATERIALS AND METHODS Thirty-three consecutive patients (16 women; mean age, 63.5 y; range, 25-92 y) undergoing fluoroscopically guided (n = 32) or computed tomography-guided (n = 1) percutaneous transabdominal gastrostomy (n = 26) or gastrojejunostomy (n = 7) were prospectively enrolled in a single-center study. Each patient had three synthetic absorbable suture T-fasteners inserted and were followed until all gastropexy button-locks released naturally, were cut by a health care provider, or were lost to follow-up. Patients or caregivers were contacted weekly to determine timing of gastropexy button-lock release and assess for postprocedural complications. RESULTS All three T-fastener button-type suture locks released naturally in 14 of 33 patients (42.4%) at a median of 29.5 days (mean, 26.7 d; range, 8-40 d). One or more T-fastener sutures were cut in 10 of 33 patients (30.3%), and nine patients (27.3%) were lost to follow-up. Accounting for patient censorship, T-fasteners in all 33 patients remained intact for a median of 35 days. Local infections developed in three patients (9%) on days 22, 25, and 34. CONCLUSIONS Relative to nonabsorbable gastropexy sutures, absorbable suture gastropexy anchors offer the potential to reduce complications associated with long gastropexy indwelling times. However, absorbable gastropexy anchor buttons usually remain intact for longer than 3 weeks after insertion. A postprocedural plan for gastropexy inspection and removal within 3 weeks should continue to be emphasized to avoid local complications, even for absorbable suture kits.","Durack, Jeremy C; Wang, James H; Sebro, Ronnie; Zhang, Kan K; Hoch, Sarah; Kerlan, Robert K",Journal of vascular and interventional radiology : JVIR,279,16

RECENT FINDINGS Generally, a small number of high-income countries export the majority of synthetic chemicals, while most low-income countries import more chemicals than they export, which may contribute to higher levels of synthetic chemicals in those settings. However, few studies have quantified exposures to synthetic chemicals in low- and middle-income countries, the health effects of such exposures, or interventions to mitigate exposures. Synthetic chemicals continue to enter markets despite our limited knowledge of their effects on human health, particularly in the most vulnerable populations.

DESIGN Prospective cohort observational study. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients (n =62) who completed an exercise training programme after implantable cardioverter-defibrillator or cardiac resynchronization therapy treatment between May 2017 and May 2018 were included. Patients exercised for 20-50 min 3-5 times weekly for 3 months and were assigned to the active (≥ 10 min/day) or non-active (< 10 min/day) group based on changes in walking times between baseline and 3 months, as assessed by the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. RESULTS The 6-min walk distance improved in both groups with exercise training. Physical activity level did not increase in some patients, despite improvements in exercise tolerance. Depression improved significantly in the active group, but no correlation was found with physical activity. Factors contributing to physical activity changes were not identified. The all-cause hospitalization rate was lower in the active group during follow-up (mean 10.5 months). CONCLUSION Exercise training effectively increased 6-min walk distance regardless of physical activity. Non-active patients experienced increased all-cause hospitalizations. Increasing physical activity improves patient outcomes.","Yanagi, Hidetoshi; Konishi, Harumi; Yamada, Saori; Kitagaki, Kazufumi; Nakanishi, Michio; Harada, Taku; Kohzuki, Masahiro",Journal of rehabilitation medicine,279,1

RESULTS In all, 13 patients were treated for esophageal perforations or leaks. Etiologies included iatrogenic injury (n = 8), anastomotic leak (n = 2), Boerhaave syndrome (n = 1), and bronchoesophageal fistula (n = 2). In total, 10 patients underwent primary treatment and three were treated with rescue therapy. Mean Perforation Severity Scores (PSSs) in the primary and rescue treatment groups were 7 and 10, respectively. Average defect size was 2.4 (range: 0.5-6) cm. The rescue group had a shorter mean time to defect closure (25 vs. 33 days). In all, 12 of 13 defects healed. One death occurred following the implementation of comfort care. One therapy-specific complication occurred. Hospital length of stay (LOS) was longer in the rescue group (72 vs. 53 days); however, the intensive care unit (ICU) duration was similar between groups. Totally, 10 patients (83%) resumed an oral diet after successful defect closure.

In the early 1990s, researchers reported that TFM induced vitellogenin in fish and that TFM was an agonist for the rainbow trout estrogen receptor. To support continued registration of TFM for sea lamprey control, regulatory agencies required further testing to evaluate potential endocrine disruption effects. Fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) were exposed to TFM at measured concentrations of 0.0659, 0.181, 0.594, 1.79, and 5.11 mg active ingredient (a.i.)/L for 21 days. No-observable- and lowest-observable-effect concentrations (NOEC and LOEC, respectively) were determined to be 1.79 mg/L or greater for each endpoint. Male survival in the highest treatment group was reduced relative to the controls. Percent egg fertility was reduced in the highest treatment group, resulting in an estimated NOEC of 1.79 mg/L. While no effect on gonadal-somatic index (GSI) was observed for males, female GSI was increased in the 5.11 mg/L treatment. Vitellogenin production was not altered relative to the controls for all TFM treatment groups. However, female testosterone was elevated in the 5.11 mg/L treatment. The results suggest that prolonged exposure to TFM at concentrations exceeding 1.79 mg/L has the potential to disrupt endocrine function. Biologically relevant effects in this study were found at the highest exposure concentration following a 21-day exposure. However, the duration of exposure in this study is not consistent with typical treatment durations (12-h) for sea lamprey control. This article is protected by copyright.

METHODS The Danish Lung Cancer Screening Trial is a randomized clinically controlled trial of 4104 smokers and previous smokers who were randomized to either screening with five annual low-dose CT scans or no screening in Copenhagen from 2004 to 2006. The major end point is the effect of CT screening on lung cancer mortality and treatment options. All diagnostic and treatment interventions in both groups were monitored prospectively until 1 to 3 years after the last screening round. RESULTS By February 1, 2011 68 cases of lung cancer were detected in the screening group. Furthermore, seven patients with a benign nodule underwent surgical treatment because of suspicion of malignancy (12%). Fifty-one of the 68 lung cancer patients were eligible for surgical treatment. Eight patients had open thoracotomy. Of the operations for lung cancer, 84% were performed by VATS in the CT-screened arm, significantly higher than the control arm (p < 0.05). Thirty-six patients had a VATS lobectomy. One patient had a VATS segmentectomy, and four patients had a VATS wedge resection. The seven benign nodules were all treated with VATS. CONCLUSIONS CT screening seems to facilitate the use of VATS in the treatment of lung cancer with an 84% rate in our data. Furthermore, all benign nodules could be removed by VATS. In our view, a basic requirement for a surgical institution to be involved in lung cancer CT screening is a dedicated VATS program.","Petersen, René Horsleben; Hansen, Henrik Jessen; Dirksen, Asger; Pedersen, Jesper Holst",Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,279,16

We investigated the managers' views on their roles, challenges and developmental ideas in promoting good HH practice. METHODS A descriptive cross-sectional study with an online survey of both medical and nursing managers was conducted within a single tertiary care hospital in Finland. Three open-ended questions were analyzed using inductive content analysis. RESULTS A total of 78 managers out of 168 responded to the survey (response rate 46%). Managers helped promote HH practices by enabling the proper environment for adherence to good HH, visible commitment, and using various means to instruct staff about HH. Challenges included the acute hospital setting and practical problems related to the managers' numerous responsibilities. Developmental ideas included information communication technology (ICT) applications for monitoring HH as an indicator of the quality of care, versatile responses to HH audits, and clarifying the roles of different management levels. CONCLUSIONS Managers are committed to and use various methods to promote HH.

Conversely, robotic surgery could facilitate the performance of segmentectomy. The aim of this study was to compare the early results of video- and robot-assisted segmentectomies. METHODS Data were collected prospectively on videothoracoscopy from 2010 and on robotic procedures from 2013. Fifty-one patients who were candidates for minimally invasive segmentectomy were included in the study. Perioperative outcomes of video-assisted and robotic segmentectomies were compared. RESULTS The minimally invasive segmentectomies included 32 video- and 16 robot-assisted procedures; 3 segmentectomies (2 video-assisted and 1 robot-assisted) were converted to lobectomies. Four conversions to thoracotomy were necessary for anatomical reason or arterial injury, with no uncontrolled bleeding in the robotic arm. There were 7 benign or infectious lesions, 9 pre-invasive lesions, 25 lung cancers, and 10 metastatic diseases. Patient characteristics, type of segment, conversion to thoracotomy, conversion to lobectomy, operative time, postoperative complications, chest tube duration, postoperative stay, and histology were similar in the video and robot groups. Estimated blood loss was significantly higher in the video group (100 vs. 50 mL, p = 0.028). CONCLUSIONS The morbidity rate of minimally invasive segmentectomy was low. The short-term results of video-assisted and robot-assisted segmentectomies were similar, and more data are required to show any advantages between the two techniques. Long-term oncologic outcomes are necessary to evaluate these new surgical practices.","Rinieri, Philippe; Peillon, Christophe; Salaün, Mathieu; Mahieu, Julien; Bubenheim, Michael; Baste, Jean-Marc",Asian cardiovascular & thoracic annals,279,5

A growing number of experimental studies have examined sugary drink warnings' impacts, but no research to our knowledge has synthesized this literature. To inform ongoing policy debates, this study aimed to identify the effects of sugary drink warnings compared with control conditions. METHODS AND FINDINGS We systematically searched 7 databases on June 21, 2019, and October 25, 2019. We also searched reference lists of relevant articles. Two investigators independently screened titles, abstracts, and full texts to identify peer-reviewed articles that used an experimental protocol to examine the effects of sugary drink warnings compared to a control condition. Two investigators independently extracted study characteristics and effect sizes from all relevant full-text articles. We meta-analyzed any outcome assessed in at least 2 studies, combining effect sizes using random effects meta-analytic procedures. Twenty-three experiments with data on 16,241 individuals (mean proportion female, 58%) were included in the meta-analysis. Most studies took place in Latin America (35%) or the US or Canada (46%); 32% included children. Relative to control conditions, sugary drink warnings caused stronger negative emotional reactions (d = 0.69; 95% CI: 0.25, 1.13; p = 0.002) and elicited more thinking about the health effects of sugary drinks (d = 0.65; 95% CI: 0.29, 1.01; p < 0.001). Sugary drink warnings also led to lower healthfulness perceptions (d = -0.22; 95% CI: -0.27, -0.17; p < 0.001) and stronger disease likelihood perceptions (d = 0.15; 95% CI: 0.06, 0.24; p = 0.001). Moreover, sugary drink warnings reduced both hypothetical (d = -0.32; 95% CI: -0.44, -0.21; p < 0.001) and actual consumption and purchasing behavior (d = -0.17; 95% CI: -0.30, -0.04; p = 0.012). Statistically significant effects were not observed for perceptions of added sugar or positive sugary drink attitudes (p's > 0.10). Moderation analyses revealed that health warnings (e.g., ""Beverages with added sugar contribute to obesity"") led to greater reductions in hypothetical sugary drink purchases than did nutrient warnings (e.g., ""High in sugar""; d = -0.35 versus -0.18; Qb = 4.04; p = 0.04). Limitations of this study include that we did not review grey literature and that we were unable to conduct moderation analyses for several prespecified moderators due to an insufficient number of studies. CONCLUSIONS This international body of experimental literature supports sugary drink warnings as a population-level strategy for changing behavior, as well as emotions, perceptions, and intentions.

Observational studies of the overlap between KD outbreaks and seasonal peaks of arboviral infections, suggest the possible role of these pathogens as triggers of KD. In Venezuela, regions with the highest reported arboviral infections simultaneously have the highest incidence of KD. One proposed explanation for this association involves the role of pro-inflammatory mediators, interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as mediators of coronary endothelial damage. The promotion of inflammation and tissue destruction by these cytokines is thought to contribute to the coronary endothelial damage experienced in KD.

This article provides practical tips on how to translate decisions around treatment escalation plans into conversations, both face-to-face and over the phone, in a sensitive and compassionate manner. Care planning conversations for patients with COVID-19 should be individualised and actively involve the patient. Focusing on goals of care rather than ceilings of treatment can help to alleviate anxiety around these conversations and will remind patients that their care will never cease. Using a framework such as the 'SPIKES' mnemonic can help to structure this conversation. Verbally conveying empathy will be key, particularly when wearing personal protective equipment or speaking to relatives over the phone.

However, the energy efficiency of BWED cannot approach optimization because of the low salt concentration of BW. In this study, a novel two hydraulic-stage ED desalination system was presented to enhance mass transfer and reduce energy consumption. In terms of energy-efficient strategies, it involved not only innovative membrane stack configurations (resin-filled electrode cells and asymmetric cell pairs design) but also optimizing inflow modes (electrolytes parallel flow and dilute/concentrate counter flow). Results showed that thin resin-filled (1 mm) electrode cells, asymmetric cell pair design (cell pairs ratio of 1st and 2nd-hydraulic stages, 1.2), and optimizations of general inflow mode were beneficial for savings 10-30% of energy consumption at the same salt removal ratio (SR). The synergistic effects of these strategies indicated that this novel ED system could save ∼40% of the energy consumption at the same SR, compared with conventional two hydraulic-stage ED system (CED). Three stage continuous BWED performance tests, compared with a CED, showed that a 36.9% total energy saving could be achieved using the novel ED system when the BW concentration decreased from 3500 mg/L to the quality requirement of drinking water (∼450 mg/L). It was therefore possible to open the way for saving energy in BWED systems.","Chen, Qing-Bai; Wang, Jianyou; Liu, Yu; Zhao, Jinli; Li, Pengfei",Water research,279,1

RECENT FINDINGS Among the various psychological theories and models of personality disorders, still the most popular and researched are psychodynamic, cognitive and interpersonal perspectives. More specifically, object relations theory, cognitive schema conceptualization and interpersonal circumplex model have produced the most empirical investigations of personality disorders in recent years. Latest work has suggested that all three perspectives have contributed to and are compatible with the dimensional personality disorders framework in DSM-5-AMPD and ICD-11 (including level of personality functioning and personality traits). These models have yielded specific psychological treatments of personality disorders; although most psychotherapies have been constructed for patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD), there is an increasing number of treatment modalities aimed at individuals with other forms of personality disorder, such as those with narcissistic or antisocial traits/disorders. More research into their effectiveness and long-term benefits is necessary.

In AQP4-IgG seropositive NMOSD, circulating immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies against astrocyte water channel aquaporin-4 (AQP4) cause tissue injury. Compelling evidence supports a pathogenic role for complement activation following AQP4-IgG binding to AQP4. Clinical studies supported the approval of eculizumab, an inhibitor of C5 cleavage, in AQP4-IgG seropositive NMOSD. AREAS COVERED : This review covers in vitro, animal models and human evidence for complement-dependent and complement-independent tissue injury in AQP4-IgG seropositive NMOSD. Complement targets are discussed, including complement proteins, regulators and anaphylatoxin receptors, and corresponding drug candidates. EXPERT OPINION : Though preclinical data support a central pathogenic role of complement activation in AQP4-IgG seropositive NMOSD, they do not resolve the relative contributions of complement-dependent vs. complement-independent disease mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, T cell effector mechanisms, and direct AQP4-IgG-induced cellular injury. The best evidence that complement-dependent mechanisms predominate in AQP4-IgG seropositive NMOSD comes from eculizumab clinical data. Various drug candidates targeting distinct complement effector mechanisms may offer improved safety and efficacy. However, notwithstanding the demonstrated efficacy of complement inhibition in AQP4-IgG seropositive NMOSD, the ultimate niche for complement inhibition is not clear given multiple drug options with alternative mechanisms of action.","Asavapanumas, Nithi; Tradtrantip, Lukmanee; Verkman, Alan S",Expert opinion on biological therapy,279,1

We aimed at monitoring cerebral activity and oxygenation continuously during neonatal transition and resuscitation. METHODS Neonates ≥34 weeks of gestation born via cesarean section were included. Cerebral activity was continuously measured with amplitude-integrated-EEG (aEEG) and cerebral oxygenation (rSO2) with near-infrared-spectroscopy (NIRS) during the first 10 min after birth. For quantitative analysis of aEEG every minute the mean minimum amplitude (V(min)) and maximum amplitude (V(max)) was determined. Uncompromised neonates were compared to neonates in need of resuscitation. RESULTS Out of 224 eligible neonates 31 uncompromised and 15 in need of respiratory support were included. Uncompromised neonates showed higher values for V(min) in the third minute and higher values for V(max) in the third and fourth minute compared to the tenth minute post-partum. In uncompromised neonates rSO2 values during the first 6 min after birth were lower compared to minute ten. Neonates in need of respiratory support had lower rSO2 values over the first 8 min after birth compared to minute ten. CONCLUSIONS This is the first study demonstrating that monitoring of aEEG and NIRS to measure cerebral activity and oxygenation during immediate postpartum transition is feasible.

In this study, we explored correlates of medical mistrust in a representative sample of adults. METHODS We analyzed cross-sectional study data from the Survey of California Adults on Serious Illness and End-of-Life 2019. We ascertained race/ethnicity, health status, perceived discrimination, demographics, socioeconomic factors, and medical mistrust. For data analysis, we used multinomial logistic regression models. RESULTS Analyses were based on 704 non-Hispanic Black adults, 711 Hispanic adults, and 913 non-Hispanic White adults. Racial/ethnic background was significantly associated with the level of medical mistrust. Adjusting for all covariates, odds of reporting medical mistrust were 73% higher (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.73; 95% CI, 1.15-2.61, P <.01) and 49% higher (aOR = 1.49; 95% CI, 1.02-2.17, P <.05) for non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic adults when compared with non-Hispanic White adults, respectively. Perceived discrimination was also associated with higher odds of medical mistrust. Indicating perceived discrimination due to income and insurance was associated with 98% higher odds of medical mistrust (aOR = 1.98; 95% CI, 1.71-2.29, P <.001). Similarly, the experience of discrimination due to racial/ethnic background and language was associated with a 25% increase in the odds of medical mistrust (aOR = 1.25; 95% CI, 1.10-1.43; P <.001). CONCLUSIONS Perceived discrimination is correlated with medical mistrust. If this association is causal, that is, if perceived discrimination causes medical mistrust, then decreasing such discrimination may improve trust in medical clinicians and reduce disparities in health outcomes. Addressing discrimination in health care settings is appropriate for many reasons related to social justice. More longitudinal research is needed to understand how complex societal, economic, psychological, and historical factors contribute to medical mistrust. This type of research may in turn inform the design of multilevel community- and theory-based training models to increase the structural competency of health care clinicians so as to reduce medical mistrust.","Bazargan, Mohsen; Cobb, Sharon; Assari, Shervin",Annals of family medicine,279,1

We hypothesized that sliding-scale insulin for severe postoperative hyperglycemia (glucose ≥180 mg/dL) could lower mean postoperative glucose levels and minimize short-term complications in patients without diabetes undergoing major joint replacement. Methods In a prospective study group, 1,398 consecutive patients, with and without diabetes, undergoing joint replacement were monitored and treated for hyperglycemia and were compared with 886 historical, less frequently monitored controls. The primary outcome was the mean glucose level in patients with and without diabetes within 48 hours after the surgical procedure. Two secondary outcomes could be examined only in the prospective study group, which, by design, had much more frequent glucose sampling and insulin use than the historical controls. First, the contribution of comorbidities and procedural factors to postoperative hyperglycemia in patients without diabetes was assessed with multivariable linear regression. Second, the ability of insulin treatment to reduce complications in patients without diabetes who developed hyperglycemia was evaluated. Results In comparison with 886 historical controls, enhanced glucose management lowered the mean glucose (and standard deviation) from 129 ± 28 mg/dL to 123 ± 23 mg/dL for patients without diabetes (p = 0.041). Multivariable linear regression revealed factors that contributed to elevated mean glucose in patients without diabetes: preoperative fasting glucose (p < 0.001), perioperative steroid use (p < 0.001), general anesthesia (p < 0.001), procedure duration (p = 0.003), and transfusion (p 0.008). Of 968 patients without diabetes, 203 developed severe hyperglycemia. The recommended insulin coverage was given to 129 of these patients, and 74 patients did not receive it for various clinical reasons. Insulin treatment reduced the frequency of positive cultures from any site (p = 0.025) and a composite of positive cultures and readmissions (p = 0.006) in comparison with no insulin treatment. No patient without diabetes who received insulin experienced mild or severe hypoglycemia. Conclusions Postoperative hyperglycemia is frequent in patients without diabetes after orthopaedic surgery, but an enhanced glucose management program can lower mean postoperative glucose levels. The treatment of hyperglycemia in patients without diabetes reduced short-term complications and was associated with minimal side effects. Level of Evidence Therapeutic Level III.

METHODS This study was performed on surviving adult comatose patients after CA treated with TTM. The average scores of rSO2 was measured at 6h intervals for the first 2days and once a day for the following 3days with a NIRS device during TTM. The CPC scale was used to define the neurologic outcomes of patients. We compared the correlations of rSO2 values between good (CPC 1-2) and poor (CPC 3-5) neurologic outcomes in CA patients. RESULTS There was no statistically significant difference identified between the prognosis groups in terms of rSO2, CPR durations, hemoglobin values and admission body temperature (p>0.05). When the variation in rSO2 values over time is investigated, though there was no significant difference between the good and poor prognosis groups, it appeared to fall in the first 6h in both prognosis groups. The median NT-proBNP and lactate values were observed to be higher in the poor prognosis group. CONCLUSION There is no significant correlation between rSO2 values and neurologic outcomes. Multimodal monitoring methods may be useful and further studies with a larger patient population are necessary in this area.","Sarıtaş, Aykut; Çinleti, Burcu Acar; Zincircioğlu, Çiler; Uzun, Uğur; Köse, Işıl; Şenoğlu, Nimet",The American journal of emergency medicine,279,5

Here, 10,870 ligands were employed and screened by the molecular docking, which involved 12 kinds of functional foods (carbohydrates, fatty acids, phospholipids, vitamin, β-sitosterol, flavonoids, nordihydroguaiaretic acid, curcumin, nootkatone, β-pinene, tincturoid, betulinic acid, and their isomers/analogs/derivatives). Then, 60 ligands were obtained with the good docking affinity. Most of them belong to quercetrin and its isomers/analogs/derivatives, which also showed the highest affinity for the main protease of SARS-CoV-2. The dynamic simulation indicated that quercetrin-protease and quercetrin-analog-protease showed the excellent stability. Compared with reported docking results, quercetrin should be the best inhibitor for the main protease of SARS-CoV-2. Considering the green and white tea are rich in quercetrin and its isomers/analogs/derivatives, tea and relative beverages may become a good option to regulate our metabolism and help us to overcome this special time. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The docking and molecular dynamics technology were combined to screen the functional foods, which would be the potential candidate of the inhibitor for SARS-CoV-2. Many functional foods screened in this work belong to necessary nutrients for body. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 would consume some necessary nutrients, and thus, damage our body. It should be further consideration whether exogenous nutrients should be provided to slow, halt, or reverse biochemical alterations and structural deterioration in our body. On the contrary, this work also provided a new possibility to design a functional food or drug to help us overcome this special time.","Wang, Jiao; Zhang, Xiaoli; Omarini, Alejandra B; Li, Binglin",Journal of food biochemistry,279,12

Arterivirus nonstructural protein 11 (nsp11) was shown to have NendoU activity and play essential roles in the viral life cycle. Here, we report three crystal structures of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and equine arteritis virus (EAV) nsp11 mutants. The structures of arterivirus nsp11 contain two conserved compact domains: the N-terminal domain (NTD) and C-terminal domain (CTD). The structures of PRRSV and EAV endoribonucleases are similar and conserved in the arterivirus, but they are greatly different from that of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses (CoV), representing important human pathogens in the Nidovirales order. The catalytic center of NendoU activity is located in the CTD, where a positively charged groove is next to the key catalytic residues conserved in nidoviruses. Although the NTD is nearly identical, the catalytic region of the arterivirus nsp11 family proteins is remarkably flexible, and the oligomerization may be concentration dependent. In summary, our structures provide new insight into this key multifunctional NendoU family of proteins and lay a foundation for better understanding of the molecular mechanism and antiviral drug development. IMPORTANCE Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and equine arteritis virus are two major members of the arterivirus family. PRRSV, a leading swine pathogen, causes reproductive failure in breeding stock and respiratory tract illness in young pigs. Due to the lack of a suitable vaccine or effective drug treatment and the quick spread of these viruses, infected animals either die quickly or must be culled. PRRSV costs the swine industry around $644 million annually in the United States and almost €1.5 billion in Europe every year. To find a way to combat these viruses, we focused on the essential viral nonstructural protein 11 (nsp11). nsp11 is associated with multiple functions, such as RNA processing and suppression of the infected host innate immunity system. The three structures solved in this study provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms of this crucial protein family and will benefit the development of new treatments against these deadly viruses.","Zhang, Manfeng; Li, Xiaorong; Deng, Zengqin; Chen, Zhenhang; Liu, Yang; Gao, Yina; Wu, Wei; Chen, Zhongzhou",Journal of virology,279,1

This qualitative study focuses on women with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease stage III or IV. AIM The aim of this study was to describe women's experiences of living with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease stage III or IV. METHOD A purposive sample of fifteen women with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease stage III or IV participated in the study. Data were collected through individual semi-structured interviews that were subjected to qualitative content analysis. FINDINGS One theme was identified, stabilizing an ever-present breathlessness by restoring strength, and three categories are as follows: managing a restricted everyday life as an expert of their illness, being afraid of contracting infections leading to suffocation and suffering and importance of continuous help and support from significant others and digital media. Breathlessness restricted women with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, living with a body they have to wait for. Managing everyday life was adapted to their limited abilities and energy. This required detailed planning, good knowledge of their breathing and body. Women were afraid of contracting life-threatening infections that caused suffering, especially COVID-19. The fear leads to isolation and digital media was described as an important means of communication. Significant others gave support and help that was practical and emotional. Women with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease experienced lack of continuous help and support from healthcare professionals. CONCLUSION Stabilizing an ever-present breathlessness by restoring strength required women with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease stage III or IV to conduct detailed planning to manage everyday life. Being afraid of contracting infections and the consequences of suffocation had increased since the pandemic COVID-19 outbreak, which led to self-isolation and an inactive everyday life. To get help, support and socialize, women used digital media.","Ekdahl, Ann; Söderberg, Siv; Rising-Holmström, Malin",Scandinavian journal of caring sciences,279,26

Patients and Methods Retrospective study of 44 eyes of 43 patients with open and closed angle glaucoma who underwent mDST. Outcome measures were: Surgical Success with 3 criteria - (i) criterion 1 = intraocular pressure (IOP) ≤21 mmHg or reduced by ≥20% of pre-operative IOP or IOP ≥6 mmHg on 2 consecutive time points after 3 months; (ii) criterion 2 = IOP ≤18 mmHg or reduced by ≥30% of pre-operative IOP or IOP ≥6 mmHg on 2 consecutive time points after 3 months and (iii) criterion 3 = IOP ≤15 mmHg or reduced by ≥40% of pre-operative IOP or IOP ≥6 mmHg on 2 consecutive time points after 3 months; IOP Reduction; Use of Anti-glaucoma Medication; Complications; Visual Acuity and Postoperative Interventions. Results Median follow-up was 40 months (range 24-77 months). At the final follow-up visit, the mean postoperative IOP was 11.5 ± 4.7 mmHg (p<0.0001). Mean number of anti-glaucoma medications decreased from 2.45 ± 1.21 to 0.54 ± 0.95 (p<0.0001). Surgical success in terms of IOP reduction was 50%; 43.2%; 36.4% for the 3 criteria respectively (complete success) and 70.5%; 56.8%; 47.7% for the 3 criteria respectively (qualified success). The complications noted were shallow/flat anterior chamber in 2 (4.54%), hyphema & bleb leak in 3 (6.81%), aqueous misdirection in 1 (2.27%), hypotonic maculopathy in 2 (4.45%) and hypotony requiring intervention in 6 (13.63%) eyes. Conclusion Combined mDST was found to be an effective surgical procedure in reducing IOP. It was associated with complications commonly encountered in glaucoma filtering surgery. The use of intra-scleral space maintainer may help lower the risk of flat or shallow anterior chamber during the early postoperative period.","Sangtam, Tiakumzuk; Roy, Sylvain; Mermoud, André",Clinical ophthalmology,279,24

We present short- and long-term post-operative outcomes from the largest single surgeon series of consecutive patients undergoing laparoscopic TME for rectal cancer. We describe the standardised laparoscopic technique developed by the principal surgeon, and the short-term outcomes from three surgeons who were trained in and subsequently adopted the same approach. METHODS Prospectively acquired data from consecutive patients undergoing surgery for rectal cancer by the principal surgeon at the minimally invasive colorectal unit in Portsmouth between 2006 and 2014 were analysed along with data acquired between 2010 and 2017 from surgeons at three further international centres. Endpoints were overall and disease-free survival at 5 years, and early post-operative clinical and pathological outcomes. RESULTS Two hundred sixty-three consecutive patients underwent laparoscopic TME surgery by the principal surgeon. At 5 years, overall survival was 82.9% (Dukes' A = 94.4%; B = 81.6%; C = 73.7%); disease-free survival was 84.0% (Dukes' A = 93.3%; B = 86.8%; C = 72.6%). Post-operative length of stay, lymph node harvest, mean operating time, rate of conversion, major morbidity and 30-day mortality were not significantly different between the principal surgeon and those he had trained when subsequently in independent practices. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic TME produces excellent long-term survival outcomes for patients with rectal cancer. A standardised approach has the potential to improve outcomes by setting benchmarks for surgical quality, and providing a step-by-step method for surgical training.","Bullock, Marc; Nasir, Irfan Ul Islam; Hemandas, Anil; Qureshi, Tahseen; Figueiredo, Nuno; Heald, Richard; Parvaiz, Amjad",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,279,1

Various studies have suggested genetic risk factors for POCD. The study aimed to detect genome-wide associations of POCD in older patients. METHODS In this prospective observational cohort study, participants aged 65 years and above completed a set of neuropsychological tests before, at 1 week, and 3 months after major noncardiac surgery. Test variables were converted into standard scores (z-scores) based on demographic characteristics. POCD was diagnosed if the decline was >1 SD in ≥2 of the 15 variables in the assessment battery. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed to determine potential alleles that are linked to the POCD phenotype. In addition, candidate genes for POCD were identified in a literature search for further analysis. RESULTS Sixty-three patients with blood samples were included in the study. POCD was diagnosed in 47.6% of patients at 1 week and in 34.2% of patients at 3 months after surgery. Insufficient sample quality led to exclusion of 26 patients. In the remaining 37 patients, a GWAS was performed, but no association (P<5×10) with POCD was found. The subsequent gene set enrichment analysis of 34 candidate genes did not reveal any significant associations. CONCLUSION In this patient cohort, a GWAS did not reveal an association between specific genetic alleles and POCD at 1 week and 3 months after surgery. Future genetic analysis should focus on specific candidate genes for POCD.","Rickenbacher, Marc; Reinbold, Céline S; Herms, Stefan; Hoffmann, Per; Cichon, Sven; Wueest, Alexandra S; Monsch, Andreas U; Steiner, Luzius A; Goettel, Nicolai",Journal of neurosurgical anesthesiology,279,7

Although the intermediate duration of action of lidocaine and mepivacaine appears to be more suitable for day-case surgery, their use is not deemed appropriate by many because of a high incidence of transient neurologic symptoms (TNSs). The present review summarizes recent clinical data on the intrathecal use of alternative local anesthetics and adjuvants that may offer valuable alternatives to general anesthesia in day-case surgery. RECENT FINDINGS Prilocaine has a similar intrathecal pharmacokinetic profile as lidocaine but with a significantly lower risk of TNSs. Onset of spinal after 2-chloroprocaine is comparable with lidocaine or prilocaine, but with a considerably shorter duration of action. Also, TNS is clearly less frequent compared with lidocaine. Although its intrathecal use has recently been approved in Europe, this is still considered to be off-label in the USA. Articaine provides an extraordinary fast onset and a short duration of spinal block, the latter being approximately intermediate between chloroprocaine and prilocaine. However, articaine is associated with a high risk for intraoperative hypotension and a small risk for TNS, albeit but less frequent than after lidocaine. Concerns regarding possible neurotoxicity of articaine remain to be resolved. SUMMARY SPA for day cases might become a most valuable method for ambulatory surgery when using short acting local anesthetics. This, however, not only depends on drugs being used but also on infrastructure (post anaesthesia care unit) and organizational issues.","Wulf, Hinnerk; Hampl, Karl; Steinfeldt, Thorsten",Current opinion in anaesthesiology,279,1

In turn, experts are equally persuasive to nonexperts on both topics.

In this work, we report the first set of measurements of mass and mass distributions for nanoparticles/viruses using a novel mass spectrometry technology. In the past, mass spectrometry was typically used to measure the mass of a particle or molecule with a mass less than 1,000,000 Da. We developed cell mass spectrometry that can measure the mass of a cell or a microparticle. Nevertheless, there is a gap for mass measurement methods in the mass region of a nanoparticle or virus (1 MDa to 1 GDa). Here, we developed a nanoparticle/virus mass spectrometry technique to make rapid and accurate mass and mass distribution measurements of nanoparticles/viruses.

It exhibits several drawbacks especially on highly dividing and developing cells. This study aimed to assess the role of Opuntia ficus indica ethanolic extract on testicular damage induced by MTX in rat. MTX was administrated for 10 days (20 mg/kg). Extract of cactus cladodes (Opuntia ficus indica) was given to MTX-treated rats (0.4 g/kg). Spermatozoa were collected from cauda epididymis and analyzed for sperm count and motility. Testis samples were used for histopathological and oxidative stress studies (assessment of malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, protein carbonyls (PCs), catalase (CAT) glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities). Moreover, levels of testosterone were measured in serum by radioimmunoassay. Our results showed that MTX had destructive effects on sperm count and motility associated with significant decrease in testosterone levels in MTX group. This effect was then confirmed by docking results. Testis of MTX group showed increased oxidative stress status. In fact, PCs and MDA were increased and CAT, GPx and SOD were decreased suggesting increased reactive oxygen species and deficiency in enzymatic antioxidant. These findings were associated with disrupted testicular morphology as assessed by histological study. Cladodes extract had protective effects on rat's gonad histology, oxidative stress and improve both sperm parameters (count and motility) and serum testosterone levels. In conclusion, our results suggested that Opuntia ficus indica cladodes extract improved MTX-induced testicular injury and possess potent fertility boosting effects in rats.

RNA metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) offers an agnostic tool for the detection of both SARS-CoV-2 and other RNA respiratory viruses in PUIs. Herein, we used RNA mNGS to assess the frequencies of alternative viral infections in SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR negative PUIs (n=30) and viral co-infections in SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive PUIs (n=45). mNGS identified all viruses detected by routine clinical testing (Influenza A (N=3), Human metapneumovirus (N=2), Human coronavirus OC43 (N=2) and Human coronavirus HKU1(N=1)). mNGS also identified both co-infections (1, 2.2%) and alternative viral infections (4, 13.3%) that were not detected by routine clinical workup (Respiratory syncytial virus (N=3), Human metapneumovirus (N=1), Human coronavirus NL63 (N=1)).

Insects overcome periods of food depletion using diapause-associated physiological mechanisms, such as increased energy resources in fat bodies and suppression of metabolism. Because autophagy supplies energy resources through the degradation of intracellular components, we hypothesized that it might be an additional strategy to combat starvation during overwintering. In this study, we measured the abundance of the proteins involved in the signaling pathway of autophagy during overwintering in adults of the bean bug Riptortus pedestris (Fabricius) (Hemiptera: Alydidae), which must withstand the periodic depletion of its host plants from late fall to early spring. Although the levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor-associated protein (GABARAP) markedly increased after the cessation of food supply, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and target of rapamycin (TOR) were not found to be associated with food depletion. Thus, food depletion appears to induce autophagy independent of AMPK and TOR. The GABARAP levels significantly increased universally when the food supply ceased, irrespective of the diapause status of adults and low-temperature conditions. In overwintering diapause adults under seminatural conditions, the GABARAP levels significantly increased during early spring. Thus, autophagy appears to assist the survival of the bean bugs under natural conditions of food deficiency.","Tachibana, Shin-Ichiro; Matsuzaki, Shinji; Tanaka, Masako; Shiota, Masayuki; Motooka, Daisuke; Nakamura, Shota; Goto, Shin G",Journal of economic entomology,279,19

Allocating the workforce was necessary to meet the surging needs of the inpatient services due to the COVID-19 outbreak, which had the potential to compromise outpatient services. We present here our approach of restructuring clinical pharmacy services and providing direct patient care in outpatient clinics during the pandemic. DATA SOURCES We conducted a retrospective review of electronic clinical documentation involving clinical pharmacy specialist patient encounters in 9 outpatient clinics from March 1, 2020 to May 31, 2020. The analysis of the clinical pharmacy specialist interventions and the impact of the interventions was descriptive. DATA SUMMARY As hospital services were modified to handle the surge due to COVID-19, select clinical pharmacy specialists were redeployed from the outpatient clinics or research blocks to COVID-19 inpatient teams. During these 3 months, clinical pharmacy specialists were involved in 2535 patient visits from 9 outpatient clinics and contributed a total of 4022 interventions, the majority of which utilized telemedicine. The interventions provided critical clinical pharmacy care during the pandemic and omitted 199 in-person visits for medical care.

Materials and Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of our pediatric VUC program of patients less than age 18 years, from March 1 to May 31, 2020. We include data on expansion of staffing, patient demographics, virtual care, and outcomes. Results: We rapidly onboarded, educated, and trained pediatric telemedicine providers. We evaluated 406 pediatric patients with median age 4.4 years and 53.9% male. Median call time was 5:12 pm, median time to provider was 5.7 min, and median duration of call was 11.1 min. The most common reasons for a visit were COVID-19-related symptoms (36%), dermatologic (15%), and trauma (10%). Virtual care for patients consisted of conservative management (72%), medication prescription (18%), and referral to an urgent care or pediatric emergency department (PED) (10%). Of 16 patients referred and presented to our emergency department, 2 required intensive care for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Oral antibiotics were prescribed for 7.1% of all patients. Only 0.005% of patients had an unplanned 72-h PED visit resulting in hospitalization after a VUC visit.

PATIENTS AND METHODS A comprehensive model of PSA during gastrointestinal endoscopy was developed to capture adverse events (AEs), guideline interventions, outcomes, and costs. Randomized, controlled trials and large-scale studies were used to inform the model. The model compared outcomes using pulse oximetry alone with pulse oximetry plus capnography. Pulse oximetry was assumed at no cost, whereas capnography cost USD 4,000 per monitor. AE costs were obtained from literature review and Premier database analysis. The model population (n = 8,000) had mean characteristics of age 55.5 years, body mass index 26.2 kg/m(2), and 45.3 % male. RESULTS The addition of capnography resulted in a 27.2 % and 18.0 % reduction in the proportion of patients experiencing an AE during deep and moderate PSA, respectively. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated significant reductions in apnea and desaturation with capnography. The median (95 % credible interval) number needed to treat to avoid any adverse event was 8 (2; 72) for deep and 6 (-59; 92) for moderate. Reduced AEs resulted in cost savings that accounted for the additional upfront purchase cost. Capnography was estimated to reduce the cost per procedure by USD 85 (deep) or USD 35 (moderate). CONCLUSIONS Capnography is estimated to be cost-effective if not cost saving during PSA for gastrointestinal endoscopy. Savings were driven by improved patient safety, suggesting that capnography may have an important role in the safe provision of PSA.","Saunders, Rhodri; Erslon, Mary; Vargo, John",Endoscopy international open,279,0

Here, we show that a very general class of protein-based biosensors can be created by inverting the flow of information through de novo designed protein switches in which binding of a peptide key triggers biological outputs of interest2. The designed sensors are modular molecular devices with a closed dark state and an open luminescent state; binding of the analyte of interest drives switching from the closed to the open state. Because the sensor is based purely on thermodynamic coupling of analyte binding to sensor activation, only one target binding domain is required, which simplifies sensor design and allows direct readout in solution. We demonstrate the modularity of this platform by creating biosensors that, with little optimization, sensitively detect the anti-apoptosis protein Bcl-2, the IgG1 Fc domain, the Her2 receptor, and Botulinum neurotoxin B, as well as biosensors for cardiac Troponin I and an anti-Hepatitis B virus (HBV) antibody that achieve the sub-nanomolar sensitivity necessary to detect clinically relevant concentrations of these molecules. Given the current need for diagnostic tools for tracking COVID-193, we used the approach to design sensors of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 protein epitopes and of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. The latter, which incorporates a de novo designed RBD binder4, has a limit of detection of 15 pM and a signal over background of over 50-fold. The modularity and sensitivity of the platform should enable the rapid construction of sensors for a wide range of analytes and highlights the power of de novo protein design to create multi-state protein systems with new and useful functions.","Quijano-Rubio, Alfredo; Yeh, Hsien-Wei; Park, Jooyoung; Lee, Hansol; Langan, Robert A; Boyken, Scott E; Lajoie, Marc J; Cao, Longxing; Chow, Cameron M; Miranda, Marcos C; Wi, Jimin; Hong, Hyo Jeong; Stewart, Lance; Oh, Byung-Ha; Baker, David",Nature,279,20

Because processing of the polyprotein is essential for virus replication, norovirus 3CLpro has been targeted for the discovery of anti-norovirus small molecule therapeutics. Thus, we performed functional, structural and inhibition studies of norovirus 3CLpro with fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay, X-ray crystallography, and NMR spectroscopy with a synthetic protease inhibitor. Three 3CLpro from Norwalk virus (NV, genogroup I), MD145 (genogroup II) and murine norovirus-1 (MNV-1, genogroup V) were optimized for a FRET assay, and compared for the inhibitory activities of a synthetic protease inhibitor (GC376). The apo 3D structures of NV 3CLpro determined with X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy were further analyzed. In addition, the binding mode of NV 3CLpro-GC376 was compared with X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy. The results of this report provide insight into the interaction of NV 3CLpro with substrate/inhibitor for better understanding of the enzyme and antiviral drug development.","Takahashi, Daisuke; Kim, Yunjeong; Lovell, Scott; Prakash, Om; Groutas, William C; Chang, Kyeong-Ok",Virus research,279,28

Metformin which prescribed as the first-line treatment of type 2 diabetes has beneficial effects on Sars-cov2 infection. These effects are including regulation of immune system, Renin-Angiotensin System and Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4 function in Covid-19 infection. It also activates ACE2, the main receptor of Sars-cov2, in the epithelial cells of respiratory tissue through AMPK signaling and subsequently decreases the rate of viral adhesion. Metformin also declines the adherence of Sars-cov2 to DPP4 (the other receptor of the virus) on T cells. Hence, regulatory effects of metformin on membranous ACE2, and DPP4 can modulate immune reaction against Sars-cov2. Also, immunometabolic effects of metformin on inflammatory cells impair hyper-reactive immune response against the virus through reduction of glycolysis and propagation of mitochondrial oxidation. Metformin also decreases platelet aggravation and risk of thrombosis. In this article, we argue that metformin has beneficial effects on Covid-19 infection in patients with type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance.

Genetic investigation later revealed 20/25 polyalanine expansion of PHOX2B gene in both girls. In this report we highlight the use of non-invasive bi-level positive airway pressure ventilators via tracheostomy, overnight end-tidal carbon dioxide trend graphs and outcomes of the patients whose diagnosis and treatment were delayed. CASE PRESENTATION Case 1: A Thai baby girl showed symptoms of apnea and cyanosis from birth and required invasive mechanical ventilation via tracheostomy during sleep. At 5 months, she unfortunately was discharged from the hospital without any ventilatory support due to financial problems. She subsequently developed cor pulmonale, respiratory failure and generalized edema and was referred to us when she was 9-months old. An overnight polysomnogram was consistent with a central hypoventilation disorder, in which the severity of oxygen desaturation and hypercapnia was worsening during non-rapid eye movement compared to rapid eye movement sleep. At 12 months she was allowed to go home with a conventional home ventilator. The ventilator was changed to bi-level positive airway pressure when she was 4-years old. After she received adequate home ventilation, she thrived with normal growth and development. Case 2: A Thai baby girl developed apnea and cyanosis from the age of 5 weeks, requiring ventilatory support (on and off) for 5 months. After being extubated, she had been put on supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula for 2 months. She was then referred to us when she was 7-months old. An overnight end-tidal carbon dioxide trend graph revealed marked hypercapnia without increase in respiratory rate. An overnight polysomnogram was consistent with a central hypoventilation disorder. Since 9 months of age she has been on home bi-level positive airway pressure via tracheostomy without any complications. Genetic testing confirmed 20/25 polyalanine expansions of PHOX2B gene in both girls. CONCLUSIONS Bi-level positive airway pressure, originally designed as a non-invasive ventilator, was found to work effectively and safely, and may be used as an invasive ventilator via tracheostomy in young children with congenital central hypoventilation syndrome.","Preutthipan, Aroonwan; Kuptanon, Teeradej; Kamalaporn, Harutai; Leejakpai, Anchalee; Nugboon, Malinee; Wattanasirichaigoon, Duangrurdee",Journal of medical case reports,279,1

Approved topical treatments for AK are unmet needs. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the safety and efficacy of hydrogen peroxide topical solution 35% (H2 O2 ) with cryosurgery for the treatment of AKs. METHODS Eligible subjects were randomly assigned to receive H2 O2 and cryosurgery on each side of their scalp/face. Patients were assessed at baseline and after 3 months of follow-up. Efficacy was evaluated based on the Actinic Keratosis Area and Severity Index (AKASI) and dermoscopic assessments. RESULTS Fifteen patients with 98 lesions completed the study. At the follow-up visit, the mean improvement of AKASI from baseline was 1.7±0.9 for H2 O2 and 1.7±0.8 for cryosurgery (p<0.001, both). Both treatments significantly improved dermoscopic features of yellow scale, white scale, linear-wavy vessels, pigmented dots, and rosette at the end of the 3-month follow-up. Complete dermoscopic response occurred in 57.7% and 73.9% of lesions treated with H2 O2 and cryosurgery, respectively (p>0.05). Regarding safety, hypopigmentation occurred more frequently in the cryosurgery group (28.3% vs 9.6%; p=0.017). Moreover, patients endured more pain with cryosurgery application than H2 O2 (P<0.001). CONCLUSION The effect of H2 O2 solution was comparable to cryosurgery. This treatment was well-tolerated and had a favorable safety in patients with AKs. This article is protected by copyright.

The safety and efficacy of ports insertion during laparoscopic surgery may be related the technique but also to trocar design. This study aims to compare physical parameters of abdominal wall penetration for 5 different trocars. Methods Eleven pigs were studied. Five different commercially available trocars were randomically inserted at the midline. Real-time video recording of the insertions was achieved to measure the excursion of the abdominal wall and the time and distance the cutting surface of the bladed trocars was exposed inside the abdominal cavity. An especially designed hand sensor was developed and placed between the trocar and the hand of the surgeon to record force required for abdominal wall perforation. Results Greater deformations and forces occurred in nonbladed as compared to bladed trocars, and in conical trocars as compared to pyramidal pointed ones, except for peritoneum perforation. Greater distance and time of blade exposure occurred in pyramidal laminae as compared to conical. Conclusion The bladed trocars have lower forces and deformations in their introduction, and should be those that cause less injury and are more suitable for first entry. Conical and pyramidal trocars with the same blade size showed similar force, deformation, time, and distance of exposed blade.","Moreno, Danilo Galante; Pereira, Cesar Augusto Martins; Sant Anna, Ricardo Kyoiti; de Azevedo, Rafael Ulysses; Savio, Luiz Felipe; Duarte, Ricardo Jordão; Srougi, Miguel; Passerotti, Carlo Camargo",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,279,31

However, current pedagogical approaches are often limited by inadequate or ahistorical exploration of the fundamental causes of health inequity. Community-engaged pedagogy and structural competency frameworks advocate for progressing from passive SDOH education to directly discussing systemic aetiologies of health inequity through reciprocal partnership with marginalised communities. Herein, we describe the development and exploratory evaluation of a community-engaged structural competency curriculum implemented in 2019 at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. Our curriculum explored the downstream impacts of sociopolitical structures on local health inequities. We engaged university, health system and community stakeholders throughout curriculum development, implementation and evaluation. Curricular components included didactic lectures, reflective writing assignments and a community-based, stakeholder-led experience in North Omaha. METHODS We used inductive thematic analysis to explore free-text responses to a post-curriculum survey. RESULTS Eighteen community stakeholders, eleven multidisciplinary UNMC facilitators, and all 132 first-year medical students were involved in the curriculum pilot, with 93% and 55.1% of students and faculty/community facilitators, respectively, responding to the post-session evaluation. Analysis revealed themes including widespread desire for community-engaged teaching, appreciation for the hyperlocal focus of curricular content and recognition of the importance of creating space for lived experiences of community members. DISCUSSION Co-created by a university-community coalition, our pilot findings highlight the crucial role of community-engaged pedagogy in promoting critical understanding of historic structural inequities and present-day health disparities. Our communities can and should be reciprocal partners in training the physicians of tomorrow.","Khazanchi, Rohan; Keeler, Heidi; Strong, Sheritta; Lyden, Elizabeth R; Davis, Precious; Grant, B Kay; Marcelin, Jasmine R",The clinical teacher,279,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS Thirty-seven patients who were scheduled for US-guided interventional procedures (20 liver cancer ablation procedures and 17 other procedures) were included. Magnetic navigation with three-dimensional (3D) computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 3D US, and position-marking magnetic navigation were used for guidance. The influence on clinical outcome was also evaluated. RESULTS Magnetic navigation facilitated applicator placement in 15 of 20 ablation procedures for liver cancer in which multiple ablations were performed; enhanced guidance in two small liver cancers invisible on conventional US but visible at CT or MRI; and depicted the residual viable tumour after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization for liver cancer in one procedure. In four of 17 other interventional procedures, position-marking magnetic navigation increased the visualization of the needle tip. Magnetic navigation was beneficial in 11 (55%) of 20 ablation procedures; increased confidence but did not change management in five (25%); added some information but did not change management in two (10%); and made no change in two (10%). In the other 17 interventional procedures, the corresponding numbers were 1 (5.9%), 2 (11.7%), 7 (41.2%), and 7 (41.2%), respectively (p=0.002). CONCLUSION Magnetic navigation in US-guided interventional procedure provides solutions in some difficult cases in which conventional US guidance is not suitable. It is especially useful in complicated interventional procedures such as ablation for liver cancer.","Xu, H-X; Lu, M-D; Liu, L-N; Guo, L-H",Clinical radiology,279,1

In this century, what is happening with the word 'pragmatic' when describing a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with medicines deserves a public reflection. Explanatory trials are conducted in ideal conditions to assess the comparative efficacy of interventions and are useful to explain whether interventions work. Pragmatic trials are those conducted in a way that resembles usual clinical practice conditions to assess the comparative effectiveness of interventions in a manner directly applicable for decision-makers. This, however, did not prevent 36% of authors of placebo-controlled, or prelicensing trials to identify their medicines RCTs as pragmatic in the title of their articles. The current situation is such that scientific literature has accepted that 'pragmatic' can convey the original meaning-that obtained in trials mimicking usual clinical practice-and a distorted one-that is focused on streamlining any trial procedure. Those involved in clinical trials should emphasize the importance of precision in the use of terms when describing RCTs through standardized solutions when possible. Unless clinical trial stakeholders agree when it would be correct to label an RCT as pragmatic, in a short period of time the term will be in danger of becoming meaningless.

We did not observe an increased risk of sICH after administration of IA fibrinolytics as adjunct to MT (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.76), nor excess mortality (0.81, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.08). Although the mode of reporting was heterogeneous, some studies observed improved reperfusion after IA fibrinolytics. CONCLUSION The quality of evidence regarding peri-interventional administration of IA fibrinolytics in MT is low and limited to observational data. In highly selected patients, no increase in sICH was observed, but there is large uncertainty.","Kaesmacher, Johannes; Meinel, Thomas Raphael; Kurmann, Christoph; Zaidat, Osama O; Castonguay, Alicia C; Zaidi, Syed F; Mueller-Kronast, Nils; Kappelhof, Manon; Dippel, Diederik W J; Soudant, Marc; Bracard, Serge; Hill, Michael D; Goyal, Mayank; Strbian, Daniel; Heiferman, Daniel M; Ashley, William; Anadani, Mohammad; Spiotta, Alejandro M; Dobrocky, Tomas; Piechowiak, Eike I; Arnold, Marcel; Goeldlin, Martina; Seiffge, David; Mosimann, Pascal J; Mordasini, Pasquale; Gralla, Jan; Fischer, Urs",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,279,31

Through two large-scale nationwide surveys (N1 = 11,131; N2 = 3,000) conducted in China immediately before versus during the coronavirus outbreak, we found that the onset of the coronavirus epidemic led to a 74% drop in overall emotional well-being. Factors associated with the likelihood of contracting the disease (e.g., residing near the epicenter), extent of potential harm (e.g., being an elderly), and relational issues (e.g., those within a marriage) exacerbated the detrimental effect of the outbreak on emotional well-being. Further, individuals' perception of their knowledge about coronavirus infection was another factor. Regardless of the actual amount of knowledge they possessed, those perceiving themselves as more knowledgeable, were able to experience more happiness during the outbreak. Higher perceived knowledge was associated with a stronger sense of control, which mediated the differences in emotional well-being. These patterns persisted even after controlling for a host of demographic and economic variables. In conclusion, public policies and mental health interventions aimed at boosting/protecting psychological well-being during epidemics should take account of these factors.","Yang, Haiyang; Ma, Jingjing",Psychiatry research,279,28

A thorough understanding of the current body of evidence regarding the benefits and risks is required. OBJECTIVES: To assess whether convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin transfusion is effective and safe in the treatment of people with COVID-19. SEARCH METHODS The protocol was pre-published with the Center for Open Science and can be accessed here: osf.io/dwf53 We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 Global Research Database, MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 Research Article Database and trials registries to identify ongoing studies and results of completed studies on 23 April 2020 for case-series, cohort, prospectively planned, and randomised controlled trials (RCTs). SELECTION CRITERIA We followed standard Cochrane methodology and performed all steps regarding study selection in duplicate by two independent review authors (in contrast to the recommendations of the Cochrane Rapid Reviews Methods Group). We included studies evaluating convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin for people with COVID-19, irrespective of disease severity, age, gender or ethnicity. We excluded studies including populations with other coronavirus diseases (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)) and studies evaluating standard immunoglobulins. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS We followed recommendations of the Cochrane Rapid Reviews Methods Group regarding data extraction and assessment. To assess bias in included studies, we used the assessment criteria tool for observational studies, provided by Cochrane Childhood Cancer. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for the following outcomes: all-cause mortality at hospital discharge, improvement of clinical symptoms (7, 15, and 30 days after transfusion), grade 3 and 4 adverse events, and serious adverse events. MAIN RESULTS: We included eight studies (seven case-series, one prospectively planned, single-arm intervention study) with 32 participants, and identified a further 48 ongoing studies evaluating convalescent plasma (47 studies) or hyperimmune immunoglobulin (one study), of which 22 are randomised. Overall risk of bias of the eight included studies was high, due to: study design; small number of participants; poor reporting within studies; and varied type of participants with different severities of disease, comorbidities, and types of previous or concurrent treatments, including antivirals, antifungals or antibiotics, corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine and respiratory support. We rated all outcomes as very low certainty, and we were unable to summarise numerical data in any meaningful way. As we identified case-series studies only, we reported results narratively. Effectiveness of convalescent plasma for people with COVID-19 The following reported outcomes could all be related to the underlying natural history of the disease or other concomitant treatment, rather than convalescent plasma. All-cause mortality at hospital discharge All studies reported mortality. All participants were alive at the end of the reporting period, but not all participants had been discharged from hospital by the end of the study (15 participants discharged, 6 still hospitalised, 11 unclear). Follow-up ranged from 3 days to 37 days post-transfusion. We do not know whether convalescent plasma therapy affects mortality (very low-certainty evidence). Improvement of clinical symptoms (assessed by respiratory support) Six studies, including 28 participants, reported the level of respiratory support required; most participants required respiratory support at baseline. All studies reported improvement in clinical symptoms in at least some participants. We do not know whether convalescent plasma improves clinical symptoms (very low-certainty evidence). Time to discharge from hospital Six studies reported time to discharge from hospital for at least some participants, which ranged from four to 35 days after convalescent plasma therapy. Admission on the intensive care unit (ICU) Six studies included patients who were critically ill. At final follow-up the majority of these patients were no longer on the ICU or no longer required mechanical ventilation. Length of stay on the ICU Only one study (1 participant) reported length of stay on the ICU. The individual was discharged from the ICU 11 days after plasma transfusion. Safety of convalescent plasma for people with COVID-19 Grade 3 or 4 adverse events The studies did not report the grade of adverse events after convalescent plasma transfusion. Two studies reported data relating to participants who had experienced adverse events, that were presumably grade 3 or 4. One case study reported a participant who had moderate fever (38.9 °C). Another study (3 participants) reported a case of severe anaphylactic shock. Four studies reported the absence of moderate or severe adverse events (19 participants). We are very uncertain whether or not convalescent plasma therapy affects the risk of moderate to severe adverse events (very low-certainty evidence). Serious adverse events One study (3 participants) reported one serious adverse event. As described above, this individual had severe anaphylactic shock after receiving convalescent plasma. Six studies reported that no serious adverse events occurred. We are very uncertain whether or not convalescent plasma therapy affects the risk of serious adverse events (very low-certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We identified eight studies (seven case-series and one prospectively planned single-arm intervention study) with a total of 32 participants (range 1 to 10). Most studies assessed the risks of the intervention; reporting two adverse events (potentially grade 3 or 4), one of which was a serious adverse event. We are very uncertain whether convalescent plasma is effective for people admitted to hospital with COVID-19 as studies reported results inconsistently, making it difficult to compare results and to draw conclusions. We identified very low-certainty evidence on the effectiveness and safety of convalescent plasma therapy for people with COVID-19; all studies were at high risk of bias and reporting quality was low. No RCTs or controlled non-randomised studies evaluating benefits and harms of convalescent plasma have been completed. There are 47 ongoing studies evaluating convalescent plasma, of which 22 are RCTs, and one trial evaluating hyperimmune immunoglobulin. We will update this review as a living systematic review, based on monthly searches in the above mentioned databases and registries. These updates are likely to show different results to those reported here.","Valk, Sarah J; Piechotta, Vanessa; Chai, Khai Li; Doree, Carolyn; Monsef, Ina; Wood, Erica M; Lamikanra, Abigail; Kimber, Catherine; McQuilten, Zoe; So-Osman, Cynthia; Estcourt, Lise J; Skoetz, Nicole",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,279,30

In early 2020, Italy became the most affected country and national lockdown was declared early on in March. We described trends in ACS from all the Marche coronary catheterization laboratories (CCL) during the global pandemic. METHODS Retrospective study of all consecutive patients admitted to the four regional CCL. The coronavirus disease 2019 period (20 February 2020 to 15 April 2020) was compared with the interyear control period (1 January 2020 to 19 February 2020) and to the intrayear control period (20 February 2019 to 15 April 2019). All patients with an initial diagnosis of ACS were included in the analysis, and further stratified into ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-STEMI (NSTEMI)/unstable angina. RESULTS A total of 1239 patients were enrolled. Daily incidence of ACS was 6.1, 6.3 and 4.5 for the interyear control period, the intrayear control period and the case period, respectively. There was no difference in overall STEMI daily incidence while NSTEMI/unstable angina fell from 3.6 and 3.3-1.8 during the case period (P = 0.01). Incidence rate ratios were significantly lower when the case period was compared with the intrayear control period (incidence rate ratios: 0.49, 95% confidence interval 0.41-0.59, P = 0.001) and the interyear control period (incidence rate ratios: 0.67, 95% confidence interval 0.50-0.90, P = 0.008). CONCLUSION During the global pandemic there was a significant reduction in total ACS and NSTEMI in the Marche region. Unlike previous reports, there was no difference in overall access to CCL for STEMI during the same period.","Flori, Marco; Marinucci, Lucia; Gabrielli, Gabriele; Baiocco, Erika; Accardi, Roberto; Scalone, Giancarla; Grossi, Pierfrancesco; Guerra, Federico",Journal of cardiovascular medicine,279,24

It is associated with negative clinical and organizational outcomes, including lower patient satisfaction, patient safety, and quality of care. The work of pulmonary physicians involves high levels of stress, putting them at higher risk of burnout. This study aimed to evaluate the personal and professional characteristics associated with burnout among pulmonary physicians. Methods Between March 2020 and May 2020, a survey to evaluate burnout and career satisfaction among pulmonary physicians was conducted in Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital. The survey collected information on physician characteristics, career satisfaction, and burnout. The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), the gold standard tool for measuring burnout, was used to measure burnout symptoms. Self-reported professional satisfaction in relation to career, specialty, and work-life balance was recorded. Results Of 130 pulmonary physicians contacted, 125 (96.1%) completed full-length surveys. Ninety-one (72.8%) of these 125 physicians were female. The survey participants had a median age of 40 years. Of the respondents, 48.8% had at least one symptom of burnout according to high emotional exhaustion (EE) score and/or high depersonalization (DP) score. Univariable analysis showed female gender, the number hours worked per week, the number of nights on call per month, and the number of calls per night shift to be factors associated with burnout. Gender and hours worked per week were independent factors associated with burnout in multivariate analysis. Conclusions The MBI was able to characterize burnout experienced by pulmonary physicians in our hospital. Gender and the number of hours worked per week were the significant factors independently associated with burnout among the physicians in our study.","Zhou, Ying; Gu, Weiqing; Tao, Rong; Chen, Chang",Annals of translational medicine,279,16

IAIs are now widely performed and recommended as the initial or only treatment of oligoarticular JIA and ancillary treatment of actively inflamed joints in other varieties of JIA. However, the performance of the procedure is currently not guided by standardized recommendations, and several practice variations are observed. METHODS This worldwide survey of pediatric rheumatologists (with 48.5% response from Pediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organization [PRINTO and Pediatric Rheumatology Collaborative Study Group [PRCSG] members) captures the differences in pre-procedural, procedural and post-procedural protocols and practices observed across the globe and asks the necessity of developing consensus in this area of Pediatric Rheumatology. RESULTS This worldwide survey of Pediatric Rheumatologists had a response rate of just under 50% and the views of about 42% who routinely performed the procedure. It captured the differences in IAI protocols and practices observed across the globe. Significant variations in practice were noted in use of Local anesthesia, choice, and dose of therapeutic agent for the intraarticular injection and use of ultrasound to guide injections. While some practice variations may be explained by institutional protocols in different parts of the world, the clinical implications of these are largely unknown and beg the need for further studies. CONCLUSIONS Given these practice variations, the authors recommend further studies to explore the cost and clinical implications and subsequently work towards developing consensus plans to ensure uniformity in this widely used procedure in Pediatric Rheumatology.","Dhanrajani, Anita; Khubchandani, Raju P",Pediatric rheumatology online journal,279,1

We describe our experience with emergency stent-assisted ICA angioplasty and intracranial stent-based thrombectomy of tandem occlusions. METHODS Procedures were performed from March 2010 to December 2013. National Institutes of Health Stroke Score (NIHSS) and Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS), occlusion sites, collateral supply, procedural details, and outcomes were retrospectively reviewed with IRB waiver of informed consent. RESULTS 24 patients, mean age 66 years, mean admission NIHSS 20.4, and mean ASPECTS 9 were included. Occlusion sites were proximal ICA-middle cerebral artery (MCA) trunk in 17 patients, proximal ICA-ICA terminus in six, and ICA-MCA-anterior cerebral artery in one. Stent-assisted cervical ICA recanalization was achieved in all patients, with unprotected pre-angioplasty in 24/24, unprotected stenting in 16/24 (67%), and protected stenting in 8/24 (33%), followed by stent-thrombectomy in 25 intracranial occlusions. There was complete recanalization/complete perfusion in 19/24 (79%), complete recanalization/partial perfusion in 3/24 (13%), and partial recanalization/partial perfusion in 2/24 (8%) with no procedural morbidity/mortality. Mean time to therapy was 3.8 h (range 2-5.5) and mean time to recanalization was 51 min (range 38-69).

Utilization of IC role-playing training with medication study cards and self-peer-supervisor review should improve student fund of knowledge and strengthen IC skills for clerkship-level medical students. Methods Between 2017 and 2020, approximately 555 clerkship medical students used our formative role-playing exercise tools. Students independently prepared psychotropic medication study cards and role-played IC during group didactics. Peer and supervisor reviews were not recorded but were discussed as a group. Students completed routine anonymous postclerkship surveys regarding the IC exercise. An enhanced IC curriculum was deployed in 2020, adding a training video and peer/supervisor feedback form. Student feedback and specialty shelf exam scores were reviewed to assess the exercise's effectiveness. Results Surveys indicated satisfaction with the exercise and increased confidence in obtaining IC. Interestingly, the student group that received enhanced IC training had fewer shelf exam failures than those without, perhaps indicating improved fund of psychotropic medication knowledge. Discussion Peer role-playing IC training is well accepted by students, allows practice of essential elements of IC and shared decision-making, and provides an engaging way to improve medication fund of knowledge. Our clerkship has initiated development of an IC objective structured clinical examination station and is adapting the exercise across specialties for longitudinal learning in response to the positive feedback and ease of use. Structured review of psychotropics and peer IC role-playing can be tailored for other specialties, medications, and procedures and further developed for use in pre- and postclerkship education.","Diana, Emily; Hamaoka, Derrick; Goldenberg, Matthew; Cozza, Kelly L",MedEdPORTAL : the journal of teaching and learning resources,279,10

Using mass cytometry of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, we identified effector memory CD4+ T cells and CD4-CD8low/-CD161+ T cells, specifically those positive for the chemokine receptor CCR6, as the circulating immune subtypes with the greatest response to IL-1β. This response manifested as increased phosphorylation and, thus, activation of the proinflammatory transcription factor NF-κB and was also seen in other subsets, including CD11c+ myeloid dendritic cells, classical monocytes, two subsets of natural killer cells (CD16-CD56brightCD161- and CD16-CD56dimCD161+), and lineage- (Lin-) cells expressing CD161 and CD25. IL-1β also induced a rapid but less robust increase in the phosphorylation of the kinase p38 as compared to that of NF-κB in most of these immune cell subsets. Prolonged IL-1β stimulation increased the phosphorylation of the transcription factor STAT3 and to a lesser extent that of STAT1 and STAT5 across various immune cell types. IL-1β-induced production of IL-6 likely led to the activation of STAT1 and STAT3 at later time points. Interindividual heterogeneity and inhibition of STAT activation by anakinra raise the possibility that assays measuring NF-κB phosphorylation in response to IL-1β in CCR6+ T cell subtypes could identify those patients at higher risk of cytokine storm and most likely to benefit from IL-1β-neutralizing therapies.","Kothari, Hema; Williams, Corey M; McSkimming, Chantel; Drago, Fabrizio; Marshall, Melissa A; Garmey, James; Vigneshwar, Mythili; Zunder, Eli R; McNamara, Coleen A",Science signaling,279,2

This study compared the impact of SLCs and low and high fracture boots on ankle motion and offloading. METHODS Twenty healthy adults were prospectively studied. High-speed dynamic radiography was utilized to determine tibiotalar range of motion in the sagittal plane during nonweightbearing (NWB) and weightbearing (WB) gait in a shoe (control), SLC, and low and high fracture boots. Sensors captured peak plantar surface forces to determine ankle offloading. RESULTS In NWB, the low fracture boot (2.2 ± 2.0 degrees), high fracture boot (2.3 ± 1.6 degrees), and SLC (2.3 ± 1.5 degrees) had significantly less motion compared with the control (3.6 ± 2.1 degrees; P ≤ .026). During WB, the SLC (3.4 ± 1.4 degrees) and high fracture boot (4.8 ± 2.0 degrees) had less motion compared with the low fracture boot (7.8 ± 3.4 degrees; P < .001). Finally, the SLC (172.6% ± 48.3% body weight [BW]) and low fracture (165.1% ± 36.2% BW) and high fracture (154.5% ± 32.9% BW) boots were associated with less peak plantar surface force compared with the control (195.0% ± 43.8% BW; P ≤ .087). CONCLUSION The SLC and high fracture boot immobilized the ankle in NWB and offloaded and immobilized the ankle in WB. The low fracture boot also immobilized the ankle in NWB, but in WB, the low fracture boot only offloaded the ankle and did not immobilize it.

The constantly growing number of hip replacement procedures is, however, associated with a proportional rise in the number of subsequent surgery-related complications. The most important complication is septic loosening of the implant. The treatment of septic complications is often ineffective and recovery becomes impossible. In that setting, an awareness of the risk factors of septic complications and an ability to prevent periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) are becoming necessary. AIM The aim of the study was to analyse the risk factors of PJI as an essential element of the prophylaxis of septic complications. MATERIAL AND METHODS We analysed the data of 142 patients treated for PJI at the Ward of Bone and Joint Infections, Department of Orthopaedics, Medical Centre of Postgraduate Education in Otwock, between 2008 and 2010. Their medical records were analysed retrospectively. The diagnosis was evidence-based, relying on case histories, physical examination and accessory investigations, including imaging studies and biochemical and microbiological testing. RESULTS The analysis of clinical data served to identify factors that appeared repetitively in the patients with PJI treated at the Ward. Those elements constitute the combination of risk factors for PIJ. CONCLUSIONS 1. An awareness of risk factors for septic complications and their early elimination are necessary in daily orthopaedic care. 2. The pre-surgery checklist is a very effective tool to eliminate the most common risk factors of PJI.","Walczak, Piotr; Rak, Stanisław; Białecki, Jerzy; Marczyński, Wojciech","Ortopedia, traumatologia, rehabilitacja",279,1

To assess whether severity of throat complications is related to the experience of physicians performing tracheal intubation, we compared the incidence and duration of postoperative sore throat and hoarseness and patient satisfaction between tracheal intubation performed by trainees and experienced consultant anaesthetists. METHODS This is a retrospective review of an institutional registry containing records of 21 606 patients undergoing general anaesthesia and was conducted with ethics board approval. All tracheal intubations by trainees were performed under the supervision of consultant anaesthetists. To avoid channel bias, the propensity score analysis was used to generate a set of matched cases (intubations by trainees) and controls (intubations by anaesthetists), yielding 3465 (sore throat) and 3267 (hoarseness) matched patient pairs. The incidence and sustained rate of symptoms were compared as primary outcomes. We also compared patient satisfaction with perioperative care. RESULTS After propensity score matching, there was no difference between tracheal intubation by trainees and tracheal intubation by consultant anaesthetists in the incidences of sore throat (32.9 vs 32.6%, P=0.84) or hoarseness (35.8 vs 35.2%, P=0.60). Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for tracheal intubation by trainees were 1.01 (0.91-1.12) for sore throat and 1.03 (0.93-1.14) for hoarseness. The rates of sustained sore throat and hoarseness over the course were low (P=0.85 and P=0.67, respectively). Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for tracheal intubation by trainees were 0.99 (0.94-1.05) for sustained sore throat and 0.99 (0.93-1.05) for sustained hoarseness.

This protocol aims to update the first systematic review conducted by Priest et al (2013), including a meta-analysis of findings. Based on previous empirical data, it is anticipated that child and youth health will be negatively impacted by racism. Findings from this review will provide updated evidence of effect sizes across outcomes and identify moderators and mediators of relationships between racism and health. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This systematic review and meta-analysis will include studies that examine associations between experiences of racism and racial discrimination with health outcomes of children and youth aged 0-24 years. Exposure measures include self-reported or proxy reported systemic, interpersonal and intrapersonal racism. Outcome measures include general health and well-being, physical health, mental health, biological markers, healthcare utilisation and health behaviours. A comprehensive search of studies from the earliest time available to October 2020 will be conducted. A random effects meta-analysis will examine the average effect of racism on a range of health outcomes. Study-level moderation will test the difference in effect sizes with regard to various sample and exposure characteristics. This review has been registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION This review will provide evidence for future research within the field and help to support policy and practice development. Results will be widely disseminated to both academic and non-academic audiences through peer-review publications, community summaries and presentations to research, policy, practice and community audiences.

Two national guidelines recommended different targets for the management of acute viral bronchiolitis. OBJECTIVES To compare the American Academy of Pediatrics guideline target of SpO2 ≥ 90% with the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network target of SpO2 ≥ 94%. DESIGN A multicentre, parallel-group, double-blind, randomised controlled, equivalence trial with economic evaluation. SETTING Eight paediatric hospital departments in the UK. PARTICIPANTS Infants > 6 weeks and ≤ 12 months of age (corrected for prematurity) with physician-diagnosed bronchiolitis admitted to hospital from a paediatric emergency assessment area. Follow-up for 6 months by standardised telephone contacts. INTERVENTION Infants were randomised to a target oxygen saturation of ≥ 94% (standard care) or ≥ 90% (modified care) displayed by a pulse saturation oximeter (Masimo Corporation Limited, CA, USA). ROUTINE CARE All infants received routine care in addition to the study intervention. Infants were eligible for discharge when they exhibited a SpO2 of ≥ 94% in room air for 4 hours including a period of sleep and were also feeding adequately (≥ 75% usual volume). PRIMARY OUTCOME A total of 615 infants were recruited, of whom 308 were allocated to the standard care group and 307 to the modified care group. The primary outcome was time to cough resolution. There was equivalence at the prespecified variance of ± 2 days [time to cough resolution: standard care group, 15 days; modified care group, 15 days; median difference 1 day (benefit modified), 95% confidence interval (CI) -1 to 2 days]. SECONDARY RESULTS Return to adequate feeding occurred sooner in infants in the modified care group than in those in the standard care group (19.5 vs. 24.1 hours). This difference was non-equivalent [median difference 2.7 hours (95% CI -0.3 to 7.0 hours) versus prespecified ± 4 hours; post-hoc hazard ratio 1.22 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.44 (p-value = 0.015)]. Parent perspective of the time taken to return to normal was not equivalent, being 12 days in the standard care group compared with 11 days in the modified care group [median difference 1.0 day (95% CI 0.0 to 3.0 days) versus prespecified ± 2 days; post-hoc hazard ratio 1.19 (95% CI 1.00 to 1.41); p-value = 0.043]. At 28 days, SpO2 was equivalent [mean difference 0.11% (95% CI -0.35% to 0.57%), within the 1% prespecified]. The modified care group (55.6%) required oxygen less than the standard care group (73.1%), and for a shorter period (5.7 hours vs. 27.6 hours). Infants in the modified care group were fit for discharge (30.2 hours vs. 44.2 hours, hazard ratio 1.46, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.73; p-value < 0.001) and were discharged (40.9 hours vs. 50.9 hours; hazard ratio 1.28, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.50; p-value < 0.003) sooner than those in the standard care group. There were 35 serious adverse events in the standard care group, compared with 25 in the modified care group. Eight infants in the standard care group and 12 in the modified care group were admitted to a high-dependency unit. By 28 days, 23 infants had been readmitted to hospital in the standard care group and 12 infants in the modified care group. Parents of infants in the modified care group did not experience higher levels of anxiety and, by 14 days, had lost 28% fewer hours to usual activities. NHS costs were £290 lower in the modified care group than in the standard care group, with additional societal costs also being lower in the modified care group. CONCLUSIONS Management of infants to a SpO2 target of ≥ 90% is as clinically effective as ≥ 94%, gives rise to no additional safety concerns, and appears to be cost-effective. Future work could focus on the safety and effectiveness of using intermittent oxygen saturation monitoring in secondary care, and to consider what are safe and effective oxygen saturation targets for children with bronchiolitis managed in primary care.

Since the novel coronavirus has spread worldwide seriously, there is growing concern that patients who have chronic respiratory conditions like COPD can easily be infected and are more prone to having severe illness and even mortality because of lung dysfunction. Loquat leaves have long been used as an important material for both pharmaceutical and functional applications in the treatment of lung disease in Asia, especially in China and Japan. Total flavonoids (TF), the main active components derived from loquat leaves, showed remarkable anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. However, their protective activity against CS-induced COPD airway inflammation and oxidative stress and its underlying mechanism still remain not well-understood. The present study uses a CS-induced mouse model to estimate the morphological changes in lung tissue. The results demonstrated that TF suppressed the histological changes in the lungs of CS-challenged mice, as evidenced by reduced generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), nitric oxide (NO), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and diminished the protein expression of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1). Moreover, TF also inhibited phosphorylation of IKK, IκB and NFκB and increased p-Akt. Interestingly, TF could inhibit CS-induced oxidative stress in the lungs of COPD mice. TF treatment significantly inhibited the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) and increased the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD). In addition, TF markedly downregulated TRPV1 and cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) and upregulated the expression of SOD-2, while the p-JNK level was observed to be inhibited in COPD mice. Taken together, our findings showed that the protective effect and putative mechanism of the action of TF resulted in the inhibition of inflammation and oxidative stress through the regulation of TRPV1 and the related signal pathway in lung tissues. It suggested that TF derived from loquat leaves could be considered to be an alternative or a new functional material and used for the treatment of CS-induced COPD.","Jian, Tunyu; Chen, Jian; Ding, Xiaoqin; Lv, Han; Li, Jiawei; Wu, Yuexian; Ren, Bingru; Tong, Bei; Zuo, Yuanyuan; Su, Kelei; Li, Weilin",Food & function,279,13

Further, COVID-19 has been associated with increased risk of morbidity and mortality arising from associated risk factors in geriatric subjects and those with other high risk co-morbidities like hypertension, COPD, diabetes and cancer. North East Indian states and the adjoining regions seem to have suffered substantially during the COVID-19 crisis due to their pre-existing vulnerabilities and under developed health care infrastructure and logistics.

Infection in pregnant women can cause severe conditions for their babies. Until now, there is no data regarding Toxoplasma infection from Makassar pregnant mothers. This study aims to obtain information on Toxoplasma specific antibodies and to measure the risk factor associate with parasite infection. This cross-sectional study conducted in 9 of 47 primary health centres (Puskesmas) in Makassar. Blood samples and questionnaires were collected from 184 pregnant women aged 15-42 years old from September to October 2020. ELISA technique was used to examine the IgG and IgM antibodies. Univariable and multivariable analyses were carried out to measure factors that independently associate with Toxoplasma antibody positivity. Our result showed the range of Toxoplasma IgM and IgG are 0.06-1.01 and 0.09-3.01, respectively. While no one of our participants has an acute Toxoplasma gondii infection (IgM positive), we found 32,6% pregnant mothers are exposed to parasite (positive IgG).

So-called yellow flags – factors that contribute to the central sensitization of pain – lead to chronicity of LBP. In the presented clinical case we identified the most common ""yellow flags"": insomnia, pain catastrophizing, restrictive ""pain"" behavior, anxiety. In practice, they often ignore the afore-mentioned factors, determine only the presence of back pain and prescribe analgesic therapy, which does not allow for an effective result. Insomnia is prevalent among patients with LBP, occurring in 47-64% of cases. With the COVID-19 pandemic among the population, the incidence of insomnia, anxiety and depression has increased. To date, the identification and treatment of these disorders is particularly relevant in the management of patients with chronic nonspecific LBP. The patient was treated, which included non-drug and drug methods and complied with Russian and foreign clinical guidelines on the therapy of chronic nonspecific LBP and on the therapy of chronic insomnia. Non-drug treatment consisted of educa-tional talks, recommendations on daily activity and sleep hygiene, cognitive-behavioral therapy, mindfulness, relaxation, and therapeutic gymnastics. The listed methods were aimed at reducing pain catastrophizing, physical and social activation of the patient. The nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug dexketoprofen was used as pharmacotherapy according to a step-by-step regimen.

Aim: The purpose of the present study was to investigate why a clinical MRSA isolate yielded false negative test results with widely used, commercial orfX/SCCmec junction site PCR tests. Methods: A collection of isolates that belonged to the same epidemic strain as the index isolate were investigated with commercial MRSA assays and all isolates were sequenced in order to explain this observation. Results: It was found that isolates of the epidemic European CC1-MRSA-IV clone, which likely originated in South-Eastern Europe and subsequently spread to Western Europe, generally exhibit this behaviour. The failure of the assays was attributable to a characteristic large insertion in the orfX/SCCmec integration site presumably targeted by such tests. In contrast to MW2 (GenBank BA000033.2, a CC1 USA400 strain which also harbours SCCmec IVa), the European CC1 clone harbours an insertion of ca. 5,350 nucleotides adjacent to orfX. This sequence starts with a novel SCC terminal sequence alternate to dcs and encodes six different hypothetical proteins (E7MHX1, ydiL2, C5QAP8, A8YYX4, npd-SCC, H4AYD7; nucleotide positions 280,690-286,024 of GenBank RBVO000005.1). An SCCmec element with the same insertion was previously found in a Staphylococcus epidermidis isolate (GenBank MH188467.1) suggesting transfer between staphylococcal species. Conclusion: In order to ensure the reliability of molecular MRSA tests, it is vital to monitor the emergence of new SCCmec junction sites, not only in Staphylococcus aureus but also in coagulase-negative staphylococci.","Monecke, S.; Koenig, E.; Earls, M.

Analysis and forecasting point out the demand for 2020, and thus yielding more concrete evidence on the pure effect of the pandemic on the tourism industry. Design/methodology/approach: Monthly observations from January 2000 to December 2020 were extracted from the Tourist Enterprises Association (SETE) for Athens, Thessaloniki, Kalamata, Rhodes, Mytilene, Santorini, Zante, Kefalonia and Crete. To model and forecast the volatility and the time trend effect of tourist arrivals individually, the study applies the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) (p,d,q) and the error, trend, seasonality (ETS) model. Findings: Empirical results suggested that Athens, Thessaloniki and Crete were three destinations with the worst losses in international tourist arrivals. Specifically, Athens was expecting to have (without the existence of COVID-19) more than 330,000 tourist arrivals in December 2020 while instead only 73,000 international tourists visited Athens that period. Similarly, Thessaloniki and the island of Crete lost more than 150,000 international visitors during December 2020. Originality/value: The author’s study adds to a growing number of studies regarding the impact of COVID-19 by incorporating monthly international arrival data and occupancy rate data for the whole 2020 reflecting differences in transportation or vacation choices.

However, current screening methods are either hampered by invasiveness or suboptimal performance, limiting their effectiveness as primary screening methods. To aid in the development of a non-invasive screening test with improved sensitivity and specificity, we have initiated a prospective biomarker study (CRCbiome), nested within a large randomized CRC screening trial in Norway. We aim to develop a microbiome-based classification algorithm to identify advanced colorectal lesions in screening participants testing positive for an immunochemical fecal occult blood test (FIT). We will also examine interactions with host factors, diet, lifestyle and prescription drugs. The prospective nature of the study also enables the analysis of changes in the gut microbiome following the removal of precancerous lesions. Methods: The CRCbiome study recruits participants enrolled in the Bowel Cancer Screening in Norway (BCSN) study, a randomized trial initiated in 2012 comparing once-only sigmoidoscopy to repeated biennial FIT, where women and men aged 50-74 years at study entry are invited to participate. Since 2017, participants randomized to FIT screening with a positive test result have been invited to join the CRCbiome study. Self-reported diet, lifestyle and demographic data are collected prior to colonoscopy after the positive FIT-test (baseline). Screening data, including colonoscopy findings are obtained from the BCSN database. Fecal samples for gut microbiome analyses are collected both before and 2 and 12 months after colonoscopy. Samples are analyzed using metagenome sequencing, with taxonomy profiles, and gene and pathway content as primary measures. CRCbiome data will also be linked to national registries to obtain information on prescription histories and cancer relevant outcomes occurring during the 10 year follow-up period. Discussion: The CRCbiome study will increase our understanding of how the gut microbiome, in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors, influences the early stages of colorectal carcinogenesis. This knowledge will be crucial to develop microbiome-based screening tools for CRC. By evaluating biomarker performance in a screening setting, using samples from the target population, the generalizability of the findings to future screening cohorts is likely to be high.","Kvaerner, A.

Setting All hospitals within England that carried out procedures funded by the National Health Service. Main Outcome Measures Number of emergency routine surgeries; cancer-removal surgeries; transplant surgeries; renal transplants Deceased and living donors); and elective routine surgeries carried out prior to and during the COVID pandemic. Results While all surgeries declined, emergency or urgent operations held up better than elective cases. There was rapid rebound between peaks. Among emergency cases, coronary angioplasty for acute myocardial infarction held up well in contrast to appendectomy, where indications for surgery are more elastic. Among urgent cancer and transplant operations, those with the most complex pathways were the most severely affected. The pandemic affected socio-economic and ethnic groups similarly. Disruption during the second peak was slightly less than during the first peak despite even greater COVID admission rates. Conclusion The NHS titrated its response appropriately to the pandemic by prioritising emergency and urgent cases over elective cases. However, complex time critical conditions like organ transplants and certain cancers are also disrupted with implications for third peaks in hospital admissions that many countries are experiencing.","Remsing, S.; Evison, F.; Vohra, R.

Here we describe the durability and broad-spectrum VOC immunity of a prefusion-stabilized spike (S) protein adjuvanted with liquid or lyophilized CoVaccine HT™ in cynomolgus macaques. This recombinant subunit vaccine is highly immunogenic and induces robust spike-specific and broadly neutralizing antibody responses effective against circulating VOCs (B.1.351 [Beta], P.1 [Gamma], B.1.617 [Delta]) for at least 3 months after the final boost. Protective efficacy and post-exposure immunity were evaluated using a heterologous P.1 challenge nearly 3 months after the last immunization. Our results indicate that while immunization with both high and low S doses shorten and reduce viral loads in the upper and lower respiratory tract, a higher antigen dose is required to provide durable protection against disease as vaccine immunity wanes. Histologically, P.1 infection causes similar COVID-19-like lung pathology as seen with early pandemic isolates. Post-challenge IgG concentrations were restored to peak immunity levels and vaccine-matched and cross-variant neutralizing antibodies were significantly elevated in immunized macaques indicating an efficient anamnestic response. Only low levels of P.1-specific neutralizing antibodies with limited breadth were observed in control (non-vaccinated but challenged) macaques suggesting that natural infection may not prevent reinfection by other VOCs.

This method mainly depends on the images captured by cameras in order to detect the mentioned objects in a variety of environments based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this study, we utilized the same method to detect coronavirus phenomena by using chest X-ray images that have been collected from three different open-source datasets with the aim of rapid detection of the infected patients and speed up the diagnostic process. We used one of the deep learning architectures in a Transfer Learning mode and modified its final layers to adapt to the number of classes in our investigation. The deep learning architecture that we used for the purpose of COVID-19 detection from X-ray images is a CNN designed to detect human in nighttime. We also modified the CNN architecture in three different scenarios named (Model 1, Model 2 and Model 3) in order to improve the classification results. Compared to model one and two, the result improved in model three and the number of misclassified cases reduced particularly in detecting Abnormal and COVID-19 cases.

Summarize various events and challenges faced. Demonstrate mindful entrepreneurial qualities to be effective. Identify various coping strategies in balancing a commercial viable model with a compassionate approach. Establish a roadmap for a healthy sustainable business model. Case overview/synopsis: Ms Rahaf Raef Kobeissi was a 33-year solopreneur, mental health coach and personal development trainer who resided in Dubai. She encountered dilemmas while attempting to offer commercial, as well as empathy and compassion-based services. She tried to strike a balance between her own broken past life challenges and managing her clients’ healing journey. Another challenge was to assess whether she should adopt inductive counseling or deductive counseling principles, especially during a Covid-19 scenario. She needed to ensure a healthy work/life balance to prevent herself from suffering from burnout. Her personal journey to becoming a solopreneur was filled with grief and hardship over the years, which she endured with little support. She had the arduous task of dealing with a series of shocking incidents and events, which pushed her down through the cracks, leading to her attempting to take her own life three times when overwhelmed by tragedy. At the age of 23, Rahaf lost her father to suicide – they found him hanging in his apartment. Her abusive mother had several breakdowns due to severe depression and her drug addict brother accidentally killed his friend in her apartment with an overdose injection. The challenge before her was to strike a reasonable balance between managing the highest levels of clinical depression with suicidal tendencies and finding the right path and purpose for her own life. This was the very reason she chose to battle depression through therapy and bounced back as a stronger and more resilient woman.

It is therefore, imperative for every organisation that, it looks beyond the visible impact of pandemic, transform into a COVID-resilient institution and prepare for future threats. We applied systems-thinking approach and used iceberg conceptual model as a tool to evaluate the determinants of pandemic impact on an organisation and to develop a long-term public health strategy. This strategy is a robust four-pronged plan comprising of stringent preventive-cum-mitigation mechanisms in place, efficient health-care facilities, improved habitability and long-term adaptation to new working-norms. The model can be replicated in any organisation which has self-sustainable in-house facilities for accommodation and health care. This strategy comprises of feasible and scientific interventions which can be used to flatten the impact of future outbreaks, epidemics and pandemics of emerging/ re-emerging communicable diseases on functioning of an organisation.

The crisis underscores the temporality and partiality of labour law measures, and the need for a reimagining of that law based on more sustainable principles. I argue that this reimagination should coalesce around a human-centric approach to law, and the recognition of the need for deep and varied institutional support for workers. It is argued that these principles have been adopted historically in the context of health and safety law, but have not always been well applied, particularly in the context of the pandemic. In any event, the adoption of these principles and the greater integration of health and safety and labour law would encourage states to better promote worker agency and resilience and hence move towards meeting the aspirations of vulnerability theory.","Rodgers, Lisa",International Journal of Discrimination and the Law,279,24

As a result of many years of collaboration, and the need for solutions in connection with the challenges with COVID-19, she and her family have developed ways of remote communication that can be mastered both by the person with an ID and the majority (those without similar disabilities). We call it doing and talking. Successful remote communication not only depends on technology and how to use it, but also on communication strategies that both work for the person with an ID and the majority. It is often the case that people with ID are expected to learn the skills necessary to adapt to the majority. We will show that success is just as much a question of the majority learning new skills and strategies that can make real inclusion and collaboration possible.

In particular, with the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) last year, in order to reduce contact, some IoT devices, such as robots, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and unmanned vehicles, have played a great role in temperature monitoring, goods delivery, and so on. In this paper, we study the real-time task allocation problem of heterogeneous UAVs searching and delivering goods in the city. Considering the resource requirement of task and resource constraints of the UAV, when the resource of a single UAV cannot meet the requirement of the task, we propose a method of forming a UAV coalition based on contract net protocol. We analyze the coalition formation problem from two aspects: mission completion time and UAV’s energy consumption. Firstly, the mathematical model is established according to the optimization objective and condition constraints. Then, according to the established mathematical model, different coalition formation algorithms are proposed. To minimize the mission completion time, we propose a two-stage coalition formation algorithm. Aiming at minimizing the UAV’s energy consumption, it is transformed into a zero-one integer programming problem, which can be solved by the existing solver. Then, considering both mission completion time and energy consumption, we propose a coalition formation algorithm based on a resource tree. Finally, we design some simulation experiments and compare with the task allocation algorithm based on resource welfare. The simulation results show that our proposed algorithms are feasible and effective.","Xiangping Bryce, Zhai Li Li Zhao Xuedong Zhao Yunlong Liu Kai",Wireless Communications & Mobile Computing (Online),279,1

Based on this observation, a clinical test based on urinary peptides predicting COVID-19 severity, CoV50, was developed and registered as IVD in Germany. We have hypothesized that molecular changes displayed by CoV50, to a large degree likely reflective of endothelial damage, can be significantly reversed by specific drugs. To test this hypothesis, we have collected urinary peptide data from patients without COVID-19 prior and after drug treatment. The drugs chosen were selected based on availability of sufficient number of participants in the dataset (n>20) and potential value of drug therapies in the treatment of COVID-19 based on reports in the literature. In these participants without COVID-19, while spironolactone did not demonstrate a significant impact on CoV50 scoring, empagliflozin treatment resulted in a significant change in CoV50 scoring, indicative of a potential therapeutic benefit. The results serve as a proof-of-principle for a drug repurposing approach based on human urinary peptide signatures and support the initiation of a randomised control trial testing a potential positive effect of empagliflozin in the treatment of severe COVID-19, possibly via endothelial protective mechanisms.","Latosinska, A.; Siwy, J.; Cherney, D.

Copper appears to have strong viricidal properties under laboratory conditions. Aim We conducted a systematic review to examine the potential effect of copper treating of commonly touched surfaces in healthcare facilities. Methods We included controlled trials comparing the effect of copper-treated surfaces (furniture or bed linens) in hospital rooms versus standard rooms on hospital acquired infections (HAIs). Two reviewers independently screened retrieved articles, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. The primary outcome was the occurrence of healthcare acquired infections. Findings We screened 638 records; 7 studies comprising 12362 patients were included. All of included studies were judged to be at high risk in [≥]2 of the 7 domains of bias. All 7 included studies reported the effect of copper-treated surfaces HAIs. Overall, we found low quality evidence of a potential clinical importance that copper-treated hard surfaces and/or bed linens and clothes reduced healthcare acquired infections by 27% (RR 0.73; 95% CI 0.57 to 0.94). Conclusion Given the clinical and economic costs of healthcare acquired infections, the potentially protective effect of copper-treated surfaces appears important. The current evidence is insufficient to make a strong positive recommendation. However, it would appear worthwhile and urgent to conduct larger-scale publicly funded clinical trials of the impact of copper coating.","Albarqouni, L.; Byambasuren, O.; Clark, J.; Scott, A.

The underlying reasons of disease susceptibility are unknown, but often include a variable immune response in lungs. Recently, we identified a surprising novel role of the interleukin 7 receptor (IL7R), a primarily lymphoid-associated regulator, in fetal-specified, lung-resident macrophage development. Here, we report that traditional, hematopoietic stem cell-derived myeloid cells in the adult lung, peripheral blood, and bone marrow also depend on IL7R expression. Using single and double germline knockout models, we found that eosinophil numbers were reduced upon deletion of IL7Rα. We then employed two Cre recombinase models in lineage tracing experiments to test whether these cells developed through an IL7Rα+ pathway. Despite the impact of IL7Rα deletion, IL7R-Cre labeled only a minimal fraction of eosinophils. We therefore examined the intrinsic versus extrinsic requirement for IL7R in the production of eosinophils using reciprocal hematopoietic stem cell transplantation assays. These assays revealed that extrinsic, but not eosinophil-intrinsic, IL7R is required for eosinophil reconstitution by HSCs in the adult lung. To determine which external factors may be influencing eosinophil development and survival, we performed a cytokine array analysis between wild-type and IL7Rα-deficient mice and found several differentially regulated proteins. These findings expand upon our previous publication that IL7R is required not only for proper lymphoid cell development and homeostasis, but also for myeloid cell homeostasis in tissues. Highlights Loss of IL7Rα resulted in significantly fewer eosinophils in adult mice IL7R-Cre lineage tracing revealed minimal labeling of eosinophils IL7Rα-deficient HSCs robustly reconstituted eosinophils in a WT host WT HSCs failed to fully reconstitute eosinophils in IL7Rα-/- hosts Several cytokines are differentially expressed in WT and IL7Rα-deficient mice","Cool, Taylor; Worthington, Atesh; Poscablo, Donna; Hussaini, Adeel; Forsberg, E.

Design: A Markov model was developed to assess four potential benefits of healthy behaviour for adolescents: better mental health, Type 2 diabetes, higher earnings and reduced incidences of adverse pregnancy outcomes. The model parameters were informed by published literature. The analysis took a societal perspective over a 20-year period. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. Setting: Secondary schools. Participants: A hypothetical cohort of adolescents aged 12-13 years. Interventions: An exemplar school-based, multi-component intervention that was developed by the Engaging Adolescents for Changing Behaviour programme, compared with usual schooling. Primary and secondary outcome measures: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio as measured by cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Results The model suggested that an intervention for improving diet and physical activity has the potential to offer a cost-effective use of healthcare resources for adolescents in the UK at a willingness-to-pay threshold of GBP 20,000 per QALY. The key model drivers are the intervention effect on levels of physical activity, quality of life gain for high levels of physical activity, the duration of the intervention effects and the period over which effects wane. Conclusions: The model focused on short to medium-term benefits of healthy eating and physical activity exploiting the strong evidence base that exists for this age group. Other benefits in later life, such as reduced cardiovascular risk, are more sensitive to assumptions about the persistence of behavioural change and discounting.","Kalita, N.; Cooper, K.; Baird, J.; Woods-Townsend, K.; Godfrey, K.

Conventional rehabilitation approaches focus on motor practice of the affected limb and aim to suppress brain activity in the contralesional hemisphere to facilitate ipsilesional hemispheric neuroplasticity subserving motor recovery. Previous research has also demonstrated that exercise of the less-affected limb can promote motor recovery of the affected limb through the interlimb transfer of the trained motor task, termed cross-education. One of the leading theories for cross-education proposes that the interlimb transfer manifests from ipsilateral cortical activity during unimanual motor tasks, and that this ipsilateral cortical activity results in motor related neuroplasticity giving rise to contralateral improvements in motor performance. Conversely, exercise of the less-affected limb promotes contralesional brain activity which is typically viewed as contraindicated in stroke recovery due to the interhemispheric inhibitory influence onto the ipsilesional hemisphere. High-force unimanual handgrip contractions are known to increase ipsilateral brain activation in control participants, but it remains to be determined if this would be observed in participants with stroke. Therefore, this study aimed to determine how parametric increases in handgrip force during repeated contractions with the less-affected limb impacts brain activity bilaterally in participants with stroke and in a cohort of neurologically intact controls. In this study, higher force contractions were found to increase brain activation in the ipsilesional/ipsilateral hemisphere in both groups (p = .002), but no between group differences were observed. These data suggest that high-force exercise with the less-affected limb may promote ipsilesional cortical plasticity to promote motor recovery of the affected-limb in participants with stroke.","Andrushko, Justin W.; Gould, Layla; Renshaw, Doug W.; Forrester, Shannon; Kelly, Michael E.; Linassi, Gary; Mickleborough, Marla; Oates, Alison; Hunter, Gary; Borowsky, Ron; Farthing, Jonathan P.",bioRxiv,279,25

The milliarcsecond angular resolution of our VLBA observations at 1.5, 5 and 8.4 GHz unveils a bright one-sided jet extended for $\sim500$ parsecs in projection. This high-z radio-loud AGN is resolved into multiple compact sub-components, embedded in a more diffuse and faint radio emission, which enshrouds them in a continuous jet structure. We derive limits on some physical parameters directly from the observable quantities, such as viewing angle, Lorentz and Doppler factors. If PSO J0309+27 is a genuine blazar, as suggested by its X-ray properties, then we find that its bulk Lorentz factor must be relatively low (less than 5). Such value would be in favour of a scenario currently proposed to reconcile the paucity of high-z blazars with respect to current predictions. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude that PSO J0309+27 is seen under a larger viewing angle, which would imply that the X-ray emission must be enhanced, for example, by inverse Compton with the Cosmic Microwave Background. More stringent constraints on the bulk Lorentz factor in PSO J0309+27 and the other high-z blazars are necessary to test whether their properties are intrinsically different with respect to the low-z blazar population.","Spingola, C.; Dallacasa, D.; Belladitta, S.; Caccianiga, A.; Giroletti, M.; Moretti, A.; Orienti, M.",,279,1

In this framework, dopaminergic neurons projecting to different parts of the striatum encode errors in predictions made by the corresponding systems within the basal ganglia. These prediction errors are equal to differences between rewards and expectations in the goal-directed system, and to differences between the chosen and habitual actions in the habit system. The prediction errors enable learning about rewards resulting from actions and habit formation. During action planning, the expectation of reward in the goal-directed system arises from formulating a plan to obtain that reward. Thus dopaminergic neurons in this system provide feedback on whether the current motor plan is sufficient to obtain the available reward, and they facilitate action planning until a suitable plan is found. Presented models account for dopaminergic responses during movements, effects of dopamine depletion on behaviour, and make several experimental predictions.","Bogacz, Rafal",bioRxiv,279,16

The COVID-19 lockdown reduced PM2.5 and increased visibility in Wuhan. Compared to pre-lockdown period, the PM2.5 concentration decreased by 39.0 μg m−3, dominated by NH4NO3 mass reduction (24.8 μg m−3) during lockdown period. The PM2.5 threshold corresponding to visibility of 10 km (PTV10) varied in 54–175 μg m−3 and an hourly PM2.5 of 54 μg m−3 was recommended to prevent haze occurrence. The lockdown measures elevated PTV10 by 9–58 μg m−3 as the decreases in PM2.5 mass scattering efficiency and optical hygroscopicity. The visibility increased by 107%, resulted from NH4NO3 extinction reduction. The NH4NO3 mass reduction weakened its mutual promotion with aerosol water and increased PM2.5 deliquescence humidity. Controlling TNO3 (HNO3 + NO3−) was more effective to reduce PM2.5 and improve visibility than NHx (NH3 + NH4+) unless the NHx reduction exceeded 11.7–17.5 μg m−3.","Yao, Liquan Kong Shaofei Huang Zheng Chen Nan Zhu Bo Xu Ke Cao Wenxiang Zhang Ying Zheng Mingming Cheng Yi Hu Yao Zhang Zexuan Yan Yingying Liu Dantong Zhao Tianliang Bai Yongqing Shihua Qi",NPJ Climate and Atmospheric Science,279,16

The results showed that, Chinese parents perceived only significantly higher stress related to children’s behavioral and emotional difficulties during the pandemic. Parents’ educational level and teacher remote support were significantly associated with the frequency of different home activities for young children. Although family direct exposure of COVID-19 was a critical risk factor predicting parent-perceived stress, parents’ education, family income, and teachers’ support were important protective factors for parents’ stress. Some learning-focused home activities showed an inverse association with parental stress. Practices or Policy: The findings of this study point to the importance of supporting parents to provide quality home-based learning for their young children during the COVID-19 pandemic. Professional support should also focus on the quality of parent-child interaction in addition to the promotion of children’s learning experience at home.","Zhang, Chenyi Qiu Wei Li Hongli Li Juan Zhang Liying Li Xueyan Li Jia",Early Education and Development,279,1

This complex pathway is only poorly understood in context of immune regulation but critical to control infection. This study examines SARS-CoV2 infection and epithelial mechanisms of the kinin-kallikrein system at the kinin B2 receptor level in SARS-CoV-2 infection that is of direct translational relevance. Methods: From acute SARS-CoV-2-positive patients and -negative controls, transcriptomes of nasal brushings were analyzed. Primary airway epithelial cells (NHBEs) were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and treated with the approved B2R antagonist icatibant. SARS-CoV-2 RNA RT-qPCR, cytotoxicity assays, plaque assays and transcriptome analyses were performed. The treatment effect was further studied in a murine airway inflammation model in vivo. Results: Here, we report a broad and strong upregulation of kallikreins and the kinin B2 receptor (B2R) in the nasal mucosa of acutely symptomatic SARS-CoV-2-positive patients. A B2R antagonist impeded SARS-CoV-2 replication and spread in NHBEs, as determined in plaque assays on Vero E6 cells. B2R antagonism reduced the expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2 in vitro and in a murine airway inflammation model in vivo. In addition, it suppressed gene expression broadly, particularly genes involved in G-protein-coupled-receptor signaling and ion transport. Conclusions: In summary, this study provides evidence that treatment with B2R antagonists protects airway epithelial cells from SARS-CoV-2 by inhibiting its replication and spread, through the reduction of ACE2 levels and the interference with several cellular signaling processes. Future clinical studies need to shed light on the airway protection potential of approved B2R antagonists, like icatibant, in the treatment of early-stage COVID-19.","Jakwerth, C.

Inhibitors interfere with the treatment by neutralizing intravenously injected FVIII. Although bleeding rate is not increased in severe HA patients who developed the inhibitor, the inhibitors reduce the efficacy of factor replacement therapy during bleeding episodes and in consequence accelerate the progression of hemophilic arthropathy. In Poland, prophylaxis in hemophilia with inhibitors has been introduced in 2016, and therefore many HA patients with inhibitor still suffer from particularly severe arthropathy, and have a reduced quality of life. The aim of the study was to evaluate the musculoskeletal health and quality of life in patients with severe hemophilia A with inhibitor before initiation of personalized physiotherapy and after 2 years of the personalized physiotherapeutic program. The study was performed in 24 persons with severe HA with inhibitor (mean age 42.1 years, median age 42 years) receiving prophylaxis regimen with aPCC 85 ± 15 IU/kg 3 times a week. At the beginning of the project, the patients were examined by hematologist and physiotherapist. Joint condition was evaluated using the Hemophilia Joint Health Score (HJHS) and magnetic resonance imaging of the most affected joint. Quality of life was evaluated using EQ-5D scale (EuroQoL). aPCC dosing schedule in context of rehabilitation program was adjusted by the hematologist. Each patient was enrolled to a personalized exercise program developed based on age, general condition, stage of arthropathy, date of the last bleeding episode, and a history of physiotherapy. The program consisted of weekly 60 to 90 minutes rehabilitation sessions at home, and participated in four 5-day rehabilitation camps with 5 hours of rehabilitation sessions a day organized in Poznan after 6, 12, 18 and 24 months of the program. All patients were examined by hematologist, and the rehabilitation was provided only to the patients on regular prophylaxis with aPCC provided that a dose of aPCC was always administered 1 hour before the initiation of rehabilitation session. HJHS varied among the participants, with mean value at baseline 34.2 (median 36.5). Baseline mean EQ-5D score was 54.2 (median 60). Evaluation at month 12 was performed in 18 participants (2 patients withdrawn from the program, and 4 patients could not participate in the evaluation due to COVID-19 pandemics). The results obtained at month 12 show a significant improving the quality of life and musculoskeletal health of patients with HA after combined prophylaxis and personalized rehabilitation. Mean HJHS decreased from 34.2 to 30.4 points (median from 36.5 to 31 points). An average 3.8 point decrease confirms positive effects of long-term aPCC prophylaxis with personalized, regular rehabilitation. Increase in mean EQ-5D score from 54.2 to 70.1 (median from 60 to 72) show enhancing patients' mood resulted from the improved health status and regained capability to conduct more normal lifestyle. After the first year of the project we can conclude that regular prophylaxis with aPCC and personalized, once-a-week rehabilitation program positively influence joint status and quality of life of adult HA patients with inhibitor complicated with significant arthropathy. Regular rehabilitation may slow down the progression of arthropathy due to the choice of the exercise program appropriate for each patient. These positive effects justify the continuation of the project in patients with hemophilia A with inhibitor.

However, little is known about the impact of proctored online closed-book examinations (CBEs) on medical students' exam performance and test anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic and the contributing factors. Methods: This prospective study was conducted among all 134 third-year undergraduate medical students from Shanghai Medical College of Fudan University between February 24 and July 10, 2020. Responses to a self-designed 12-item online questionnaire about the impact of online examinations were collected. The final exam scores for classroom examinations in 2019 were collected for comparison. Results: A total of 120 (45 male and 75 female) students with a mean age of 21 years participated in the survey with a 100% response rate. The mean exam scores did not differ by school year, gender, degrees of anxiety and impact groups (P=0.931). Almost 97.5% of medical students experienced test anxiety during online CBEs. Female students (48.0%) were more vulnerable to a negative impact of online CBEs than male students (28.9%) and preferred (68.0%) closed-book classroom or open-book online examinations more than male students did (48.9%) (P=0.003 and P=0.019). The contributing factors included poor adaptation to online examinations (58.5%) and concerns about the unfairness of online examinations (41.5%). Conclusions: Test anxiety was common in students who lacked experience with online CBEs. Although online CBEs did not impact final exam scores, special attention should be paid to female students who are not adapted to online examinations. Sufficient instruction about the exam platform, individual-needs-based simulation tests prior to formal exams, and assurance of fairness during the online examination are beneficial to alleviate the negative impact of online examinations on exam performance and test anxiety.

Various processes, such as ventilation and filtration, have been shown to reduce the probability of disease spread by removing or deactivating exhaled aerosols that potentially contain infectious material. However, such qualitative recommendations fail to specify how much of these or other disinfection techniques are needed to achieve acceptable risk levels in a particular space. An additional complication is that application of these techniques inevitably increases energy costs, the magnitude of which can vary significantly based on local weather. Moreover, the operational flexibility available to the HVAC system may be inherently limited by equipment capacities and occupant comfort requirements. Given this knowledge gap, we propose a set of dynamical models that can be used to estimate airborne transmission risk and energy consumption for building HVAC systems, based on comfort preferences and weather conditions. By combining physics-based material balances with phenomenological models of the HVAC control system, it is possible to predict time-varying airflows and other HVAC variables, which are then used to calculate the key metrics. Through a variety of examples involving real and simulated commercial buildings, we show that our models can be used for monitoring purposes by applying them directly to transient building data as operated, or they may be embedded within a multi-objective optimization framework to evaluate the tradeoff between infection risk and energy consumption. By combining these applications, building managers can determine which spaces are in need of infection risk reduction and how to provide that reduction at the lowest energy cost. The key finding is that both the baseline infection risk and the most energy-efficient disinfection source can vary significantly from space to space and depend sensitively on the weather, thus underscoring the importance of the quantitative predictions provided by the models.","Risbeck, M.

There is uncertainty about its predisposing factors and the extent of the resultant public health burden, with estimates of prevalence and duration varying widely. Methods Within rounds 3-5 of the REACT-2 study, 508,707 people in the community in England were asked about a prior history of COVID-19 and the presence and duration of 29 different symptoms. We used uni- and multivariable models to identify predictors of persistence of symptoms (12 weeks or more). We estimated the prevalence of symptom persistence at 12 weeks, and used unsupervised learning to cluster individuals by symptoms experienced. Results Among the 508,707 participants, the weighted prevalence of self-reported COVID-19 was 19.2% (95% CI: 19.1,19.3). 37.7% of 76,155 symptomatic people post COVID-19 experienced at least one symptom, while 14.8% experienced three or more symptoms, lasting 12 weeks or more. This gives a weighted population prevalence of persistent symptoms of 5.75% (5.68, 5.81) for one and 2.22% (2.1, 2.26) for three or more symptoms. Almost a third of people 8,771/28,713 (30.5%) with at least one symptom lasting 12 weeks or more reported having had severe COVID-19 symptoms ('significant effect on my daily life') at the time of their illness, giving a weighted prevalence overall for this group of 1.72% (1.69,1.76). The prevalence of persistent symptoms was higher in women than men (OR: 1.51 [1.46,1.55]) and, conditional on reporting symptoms, risk of persistent symptoms increased linearly with age by 3.5 percentage points per decade of life. Obesity, smoking or vaping, hospitalisation , and deprivation were also associated with a higher probability of persistent symptoms, while Asian ethnicity was associated with a lower probability. Two stable clusters were identified based on symptoms that persisted for 12 weeks or more: in the largest cluster, tiredness predominated, while in the second there was a high prevalence of respiratory and related symptoms. Interpretation A substantial proportion of people with symptomatic COVID-19 go on to have persistent symptoms for 12 weeks or more, which is age-dependent. Clinicians need to be aware of the differing manifestations of Long COVID which may require tailored therapeutic approaches.

Quand ce n'est pas possible, malgré les avantages que procurent les nouvelles technologies, ce sont les objectifs de la politique fiscale et des avantages sociaux qui devraient dicter les lignes de démarcation plutôt que les liens avec la jurisprudence qui a évolué dans d'autres domaines.Alternate abstract:The COVID-19 pandemic has strained tax and social security systems. Cracks that have existed for some time have been opened up further and are unlikely to close without structural repair. New insights into the shifting nature of work, combined with the development of technologies that can provide modern, practical solutions to old problems, offer the opportunity to rethink the way we tax gig workers and other non-standard providers of labour. This article argues that we need to free ourselves from the employment status classifications developed in other areas of law, for other purposes, when we consider the design of tax and social security provisions. We should aim to harmonize the tax and social security treatment of all those who provide labour as far as is practically possible in order to increase equity and remove distortions. Where that cannot be achieved, despite the benefits of new technologies, dividing lines should be dictated by tax and benefits policy objectives rather than linkages to case law that has evolved in other areas.","Freedman, Judith",Canadian Tax Journal,279,1

This capsaicin-induced increase in vascular permeability is potentiated by viral infections of the respiratory tract. The present study was done to determine whether this ""neurogenic plasma extravasation"" can be inhibited by glucocorticoids, to learn the time course of this inhibition, and to determine whether glucocorticoids can prevent the potentiating effect of viral respiratory infections on neurogenic plasma extravasation. Groups of pathogen-free F344 rats were treated with dexamethasone for 2 or 8 h (4 mg/kg i.p.) or 48 or 120 h (0.5-4 mg/kg per d i.p.). Another group of rats was treated with dexamethasone for 120 h following the intranasal inoculation of Sendai virus. The magnitude of plasma extravasation produced by capsaicin or substance P was assessed after this treatment by using Monastral blue pigment and Evans blue dye as intravascular tracers. We found that dexamethasone reduced, in a dose-dependent fashion, the magnitude of plasma extravasation produced in the rat trachea by capsaicin and substance P. Significant inhibition was produced by a dose of dexamethasone as small as 0.5 mg/kg i.p. The effect of dexamethasone had a latency of several hours and reached a maximum after 2 d of treatment. Furthermore, dexamethasone prevented the potentiation of neurogenic plasma extravasation usually present after 5 d of Sendai virus respiratory infection.","Piedimonte, G; McDonald, D M; Nadel, J A",The Journal of clinical investigation,279,24

We aimed to examine the epidemiology, attendance patterns, disposition, and adherence to follow-up, by FWs on work permit to two emergency departments (EDs) in Singapore. METHODS In this retrospective observational study, we included consecutive FWs on work permit who registered at the EDs of two public restructured hospitals from 1 May 2016 to 31 October 2016. Data obtained from electronic medical records included patient demographics, triage acuity, disposition, ED diagnoses and bill information. RESULTS There were 6,429 individual FWs on work permit who contributed to 7,157 ED visits over the 6-month study period, with male predominance (72.7%, 4672/6429), and median age of 31 (interquartile range 26 to 38) years. A high proportion of these FWs were triaged to low-acuity status compared to the general ED population (66.9% versus 45.9%, P<0.001). Trauma-related injuries contributed to 34.4% of their visits, and were more likely to result in admission compared to non-trauma-related conditions (18.7% vs 15.2%, P<0.001). FWs engaged in shipyard, construction and process industries were more likely to be discharged ""against medical advice"" (14.8% vs 3.2%, P<0.001), and default their specialist outpatient follow-up (50.1% vs 34.2%, P<0.001) for non-trauma-related conditions compared to trauma-related injuries. CONCLUSION In Singapore, the EDs of public restructured hospitals provide healthcare safety nets to FWs on work permit. These workers made more low-acuity visits compared to the general population during the study period and may face potential barriers to admission and follow-up.","Chan, Joanna S E; Chia, Dennis W J; Hao, Ying; Lian, Sherman W Q; Chua, Mui Teng; Ong, Marcus E H","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",279,1

It originated from the Hubei province in China as a case of pneumonia, later named COVID-19.1 The causative pathogen, a new enveloped betacoronavirus2 is now known as Severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus-2 (SARS-CoV 2). India reported its first case of COVID19, on 30th January 2020. We aim to identify the defining clinical and radiological characteristics, severity and prognosis, along with impact of age on outcome. Methods Cross sectional, observational study of patients diagnosed with COVID -19 [RT-PCR]. Results We observed male predominance, mean age of 36 years, with less or no symptoms, majority brought in after screening and contact tracing by the screening teams. Thrombocytopenia, lymphocytosis, raised LDH was common (>35%, p<0.05). Patients over the age of 60 were the ones having severe illness and more complications (p<0.05). Radiographic abnormality was frequently associated irrespective of clinical presentation and its severity. Poor prognosis was noted in elderly, especially those with co-morbidities. Discussion Though the disease has a relatively mild course in this part of the subcontinent, patients aged ≥60 are at significant risk for morbidity and mortality. Clinical and laboratory findings are similar to those found in viral diseases. Increased risk of cardiac involvement needs to be looked into. Chest X-ray proves sufficient for imaging, reducing the requirement of CT scans. Studies involving larger sample size and interventional trials are need of the hour.","Saluja, Manoj; Pillai, Drishya; Jeliya, Shivcharan; Bauddh, Nitesh; Chandel, Rahul",The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India,279,12

Phosphoamino acid analysis of authentic and recombinant N proteins demonstrated that serine residues were exclusively phosphorylated. The pattern of phosphorylated N protein cellular distribution in comparison with that of [(35)S]methionine-labeled N protein suggested that phosphorylation does not influence subcellular localization of the protein. Time course studies showed that phosphorylation occurred during, or shortly after, synthesis of the N protein and that the protein remained stably phosphorylated throughout the life cycle of the virus to the extent that phosphorylated N protein was found in the mature virion. Two-dimensional electrophoresis and acid-urea gel electrophoresis showed that one species of the N protein is predominant in virus-infected cells, suggesting that multiple phosphorylated isoforms of N do not exist.","Wootton, Sarah K; Rowland, Raymond R R; Yoo, Dongwan",Journal of virology,279,31

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of SG on weight loss, and to determine the postoperative course, clinical presentation and treatment of complications after SG. METHODS Between January 2006 and October 2012, 153 consecutive patients underwent SG. All data were prospectively collected in a computerized database. RESULTS This series comprised 119 females and 34 males with a median age of 46 years and a median preoperative BMI of 42.3 kg/m2. The median EWL was 53.0 % after 18.4 months of follow-up. The median postoperative BMI was 33.3 kg/m2 (range 19.7–56.1 kg/m2). Eight patients (5.2 %) required re-laparoscopy to manage postoperative hemorrhage (3.3 %) and leakage (1.9 %). Neither abdominal drains nor postoperative contrast-swallow studies were successful in diagnosing hemorrhage or leaks in our patients. CONCLUSION SG is an effective procedure to achieve significant short-term weight loss. Clinical signs, such as tachycardia, pain, fever and hypotension, provide the best evidence of the presence of postoperative leakage or bleeding. An early diagnosis of these complications is the key to ensuring adequate treatment with immediate re-laparoscopy.","Mittermair, Reinhard; Sucher, Robert; Perathoner, Alexander",Surgery today,279,29

MRC-5 cell culture grown stocks were prepared from: 1. CV Paris, a strain of OC43 recovered from an outbreak of necrotizing enterocolitis in newborns. 2. CV Mb, a neurotropic strain of OC43 which exhibits strict neuronal specificity in murine neuronal cell cultures. 3. CV Rd, a strain of OC43 which grows to a high titer in human rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells. Immunofluorescent staining for nucleocapsid antigen and plaque assay in MRC-5 cells was used to detect viral replication. BG-9 (human foreskin) cells challenged with vesicular stomatitis virus were used to detect IFN alpha production by human peripheral blood monocytes (PBMC) stimulated by virus infected Caco-2 cells. Caco-2 cells infected with virus at a multiplicity of infection of 0.5 yielded 10(4.6) and 10(4.4) plaque forming units/ml (pfu/ml) with CV Rd and CV Paris respectively, while CV Mb yielded only 10(3) pfu/ml. Caco-2 cells infected with CV Rd induced 64 IU/ml of IFN alpha in PBMC while these cells infected with CV Paris induced less than 2 IU/ml IFN alpha. In cells infected with CV Mb 4 IU/ml IFN alpha was detected. The results suggest that a lack of IFN alpha induction by CV Paris may be an indicator of its enteropathogenic potential.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","Collins, A R",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,279,20

The 3' UTRs of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and bovine coronavirus (BCV) are more than 30% divergent. In an effort to learn what parts of these regions might be functionally interchangeable, we attempted to replace the 3' UTR of MHV with its BCV counterpart by targeted RNA recombination. Initially, we tried to substitute the 3' 267 nucleotides (nt) of the 301 nt MHV 3' UTR with the corresponding region of the BCV 3' UTR. This exchange did not yield viable recombinant viruses, and the donor DI RNA was shown to be unable to replicate with MHV as a helper virus. Subsequent analysis revealed that the entire BCV 3' UTR could be inserted into the MHV genome in place of the entire MHV 3' UTR. It resulted that the failure of the initial attempted substitution was due to the inadvertent disruption of an essential conserved bulged stem-loop secondary structure in the MHV and BCV 3' URTs immediately downstream of the N gene stop codon.","Hsue, B; Masters, P S",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,279,2

DESIGN: Empirical qualitative interview study. SETTING: A publicly run nursing home in an urban area in Sweden in June 2020. The nursing home had visitor restrictions, cancelled activities and physical distancing requirements since March 2020. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 10 persons, 85-100 years, living in a Swedish nursing home during the COVID-19 pandemic, were recruited through nursing home management and interviewed in June 2020 using medically approved visors and physical distancing. ANALYSIS: Interviews were analysed using thematic analysis, which involves familiarisation, coding and definition of themes. Transcripts were coded into data-driven categories before being organised into categories that described and explained the data. RESULTS: The analysis resulted in the main theme 'It is like living in a bubble', that describes everyday life in the nursing home during the pandemic as a world of its own in which the older persons felt both protected and isolated. This is described in four subthemes: living 1 day at a time, without fear of the virus; feeling taken care of; having limited freedom and missing out on the little extras. CONCLUSIONS: Contributing to the growing area of COVID-19-related research, our findings provide novel insights into how pandemic-related restrictions in nursing homes represent a risk of isolating older people from the outside world and diminishing their freedom. Put in relation to the previous research, these findings could be applied beyond the pandemic, to develop research and practice that puts focus on how to support older people to decide for themselves how to spend the rest of their lives.","Lood, Qarin; Haak, Maria; Dahlin-Ivanoff, Synneve",BMJ Open,279,1

Primary outcome was endotracheal intubation (ETI) rate. In-hospital mortality, time to ETI, tracheostomy, length of RICU and hospital stay served as secondary outcomes. Risk factors associated to ETI among PP patients were also investigated. RESULTS: A total of 114 patients were included, 76 in the SC and 38 in the PP group. Unadjusted Kaplan-Meier estimates showed greater effect of PP compared to SC on ETI rate (HRâ¯=â¯0.45 95% CI [0.2-0.9], pâ¯=â¯0.02) even after adjustment for baseline confounders (HRâ¯=â¯0.59 95% CI [0.3-0.94], pâ¯=â¯0.03). After stratification according to non-invasive respiratory support, PP showed greater significant benefit for those on High Flow Nasal Cannulae (HRâ¯=â¯0.34 95% CI [0.12-0.84], pâ¯=â¯0.04). Compared to SC, PP patients also showed a favorable difference in terms of days free from respiratory support, length of RICU and hospital stay while mortality and tracheostomy rate were not significantly different. CONCLUSIONS: Prone positioning in awake and spontaneously breathing Covid-19 patients is feasible and associated with a reduction of intubation rate, especially in those patients undergoing HFNC. Although our results are intriguing, further randomized controlled trials are needed to answer all the open questions remaining pending about the real efficacy of PP in this setting.","Tonelli, Roberto; Pisani, Lara; Tabbì, Luca; Comellini, Vittoria; Prediletto, Irene; Fantini, Riccardo; Marchioni, Alessandro; Andrisani, Dario; Gozzi, Filippo; Bruzzi, Giulia; Manicardi, Linda; Busani, Stefano; Mussini, Cristina; Castaniere, Ivana; Bassi, Ilaria; Carpano, Marco; Tagariello, Federico; Corsi, Gabriele; d039,; Amico, Roberto; Girardis, Massimo; Nava, Stefano; Clini, Enrico","Pulmonology (Barc., Print)",279,16

Several factors may contribute to this observation, including the effect of lockdown, social distancing, lower humidity, lower air pollution, and potential changes in the intrinsic pathogenicity of the virus. In this regard, the clinical severity of COVID-19 could be attenuated by mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genome that decrease its virulence, as well as by lower virus inocula. Methods: In this pilot study, we compared the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification profile of 100 nasopharyngeal swabs consecutively collected in April, during the peak of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, to that of 100 swabs collected using the same procedure in May. Results: The mean Ct value of positive samples collected in May was significantly higher than that of samples collected in the previous period (ORF 1a/b gene: 31.85 ± 0.32 vs. 28.37 ± 0.5, p<0.001; E gene: 33.76 ± 0.38 vs. 29.79 ± 0.63, p<0.001), suggesting a lower viral load at the time of sampling. No significant differences were observed between male and females in the two periods, whilst higher viral loads were found in (i) patients over 60-years old, and (ii) patients that experienced severe COVID-19 during the early stages of the pandemic. Conclusions: This pilot study prompts further investigation on the correlation between SARS-CoV-2 load and different clinical manifestation of COVID-19 during different phases of the pandemic. Laboratories should consider reporting quantitative viral load data in the molecular diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Clementi, Nicola; Ferrarese, Roberto; Tonelli, Marco; Amato, Virginia; Racca, Sara; Locatelli, Massimo; Lippi, Giuseppe; Silvestri, Guido; Clementi, Massimo; Mancini, Nicasio",Clin Chem Lab Med,279,16

The standard of care for pharmacological interventions evolved during this period as new and repurposed treatments were used alone and in combination. Though these medications have been studied individually, data are limited regarding the relative impact of different medication combinations. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the association of COVID-19-related mortality and observed medication combinations and to determine whether changes in medication-related practice patterns and measured patient characteristics, alone, explain the decline in mortality seen early in the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted at a multi-hospital healthcare system exploring the association of mortality and combinations of remdesivir, corticosteroids, anticoagulants, tocilizumab, and hydroxychloroquine. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify predictors of mortality for both the overall population and the population stratified by intensive care and non-intensive care unit admissions. A separate model was created to control for the change in unmeasured variables over time. RESULTS: For all patients, four treatment combinations were associated with lower mortality: Anticoagulation Only (OR 0.24, p < 0.0001), Anticoagulation and Remdesivir (OR 0.25, p = 0.0031), Anticoagulation and Corticosteroids (OR 0.53, p = 0.0263), and Anticoagulation, Corticosteroids and Remdesivir (OR 0.42, p = 0.026). For non-intensive care unit patients, the same combinations were significantly associated with lower mortality. For patients admitted to the intensive care unit, Anticoagulation Only was the sole treatment category associated with decreased mortality. When adjusted for demographics, clinical characteristics, and all treatment combinations there was an absolute decrease in the mortality rate by 2.5% between early and late periods of the study. However, when including an additional control for changes in unmeasured variables overtime, the absolute mortality rate decreased by 5.4%. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that anticoagulation was the most significant treatment for the reduction of COVID-related mortality. Anticoagulation Only was the sole treatment category associated with a significant decrease in mortality for both intensive care and non-intensive care patients. Treatment combinations that additionally included corticosteroids and/or remdesivir were also associated with decreased mortality, though only in the non-intensive care stratum. Further, we found that factors other than measured changes in demographics, clinical characteristics or pharmacological interventions accounted for an additional decrease in the COVID-19-related mortality rate over time.","Coppock, Dagan; Baram, Michael; Chang, Anna Marie; Henwood, Patricia; Kubey, Alan; Summer, Ross; Zurlo, John; Li, Michael; Hess, Bryan",PLoS One,279,16

The prediction of malignancy is an enigma. The aim of this study is to explore the relationship between operative measurements and malignancy prognosis of SPTP patients. Methods: A cohort of consecutive 102 patients were enrolled in this study. Preoperative measurements and clinical outcomes were analyzed. Results: Eighteen patients (17.6%) were confirmed as malignant. The malignant SPTP of the optimal cut-off value was 47.9 (p=0.012) for prognostic nutritional index (PNI). The value of PNI&#8804;47.9 and incomplete capsule were significantly correlated with malignancy. Univariate analysis showed that the PNI&#8804;47.9 (p=0.013) and incomplete capsule (p<0.001) were predictors of disease-specific survival (DSS). Multivariate analysis identified the PNI&#8804;47.9 (p=0.036) and incomplete capsule (p=0.023) as the independent prognostic factors of DSS. The new score of 0,1,2 based on PNI and capsule presence stratified the patients into 3 groups. The patients with low PNI and incomplete capsule achieved the worst prognosis. Conclusion: The combination test of operative PNI and capsule presence would be a reliable indicator of the aggressive natural history of SPTP.","Song, He; Dong, Ming",Cancer Manag Res,279,16

We aimed to determine whether early treatment with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) would be more efficacious than no-treatment for outpatients with mild Covid-19. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, open label, randomized controlled trial in Catalonia (Spain) between March 17, and May 26, 2020. Eligible Covid-19 cases were non-hospitalized adult patients with recently confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and less than five days of symptoms. Patients were assigned to receive HCQ (800 mg on day 1, followed by 400 mg once daily for 6 days) or no antiviral treatment (not-placebo controlled). Study outcomes were the reduction of viral RNA load in nasopharyngeal swabs up to 7 days after treatment start, patient disease progression using the WHO scale up to 28 days, and time to complete resolution of symptoms. Adverse events were assessed up to 28 days. RESULTS: A total of 293 patients were eligible for intention-to-treat analysis: 157 in the control arm and 136 in the intervention arm. The mean age was 41.6 years (SD 12.6), mean viral load at baseline was 7.90 (SD 1.82) Log10 copies/mL, and median time from symptom onset to randomization was 3 days. No significant differences were found in the mean reduction of viral load at day 3 (-1.41 vs. -1.41 Log10 copies/mL in the control and intervention arm, respectively; difference 0.01 [95% CI -0.28;0.29]) or at day 7 (-3.37 vs. -3.44; d -0.07 [-0.44;0.29]). This treatment regimen did not reduce risk of hospitalization (7.1%, control vs. 5.9%, intervention; RR 0.75 [0.32;1.77]) nor shortened the time to complete resolution of symptoms (12 days, control vs. 10 days, intervention; p = 0.38).

Sometimes, it is reduced to a list of shared principles such as transparency, non-discrimination, and sustainability;at other times, it is conflated with specific mechanisms for certification of algorithmic solutions or ways to protect the privacy of personal data. We suggest a conceptual and normative approach to AI governance in the context of a global digital public goods ecosystem to enable progress on the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Conceptually, we propose rooting this approach in the human capability concept—what people are able to do and to be, and in a layered governance framework connecting the local to the global. Normatively, we suggest the following six irreducibles: &lt;underline&gt;a&lt;/underline&gt; . human rights first;&lt;underline&gt;b&lt;/underline&gt; . multi-stakeholder smart regulation;&lt;underline&gt;c&lt;/underline&gt; . privacy and protection of personal data;&lt;underline&gt;d&lt;/underline&gt; . a holistic approach to data use captured by the 3Ms—misuse of data, missed use of data and missing data;&lt;underline&gt;e&lt;/underline&gt; . global collaboration (‘digital cooperation’);&lt;underline&gt;f&lt;/underline&gt; . basing governance more in practice, in particular, thinking separately and together about data and algorithms.

In this observational cohort study at a single health care system, we examined if there were differences in eligibility for treatment with remdesivir based on clinical trial criteria for racial and ethnic minorities compared to non-Hispanic Whites. 201 electronic medical record charts were reviewed manually. Self-identified Whites were older than other racial or ethnic groups. At the time of presentation, Black, Latinx, and White participants met inclusion criteria for remdesivir at similar rates (72%, 80%, and 73% respectively), and exclusion criteria at similar rates (43%, 38% and 49% for Black, Latinx and White participants respectively). In this study, there was no difference in eligibility for remdesivir based on race or ethnicity alone.","Pischel, Lauren; Walelo, Makeda; Benson, Jemma; Osborn, Rebecca; Schrier, Rachel; Tuan, Jessica; Barakat, Lydia; Ogbuagu, Onyema",PLoS One,279,21

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we have evaluated the comparative safety and efficacy of L/R combination. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Comparative, observational studies and controlled clinical trials comparing L/R combination to standard of care (SOC)/control or any other antiviral agent/combinations were included. A total of 10 databases were searched to identify 13 studies that fulfilled the predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria. RESULTS: No discernible beneficial effect was seen in the L/R group in comparison to SOC/control in terms of ""progression to more severe state"" (4 studies, odds ratio [OR]: 1.446 [0.722-2.895]), ""mortality"" (3 studies, OR: 1.208 [0.563-2.592]), and ""virological cure on days 7-10"" (3 studies, OR: 0.777 [0.371-1.630]), while the L/R combination arm performed better than the SOC/control arm in terms of ""duration of hospital stay"" (3 studies, mean difference (MD): -1.466 [-2.403 to - 0.529]) and ""time to virological cure"" (3 studies, MD: -3.272 [-6.090 to - 0.454]). No difference in efficacy was found between L/R versus hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and L/R versus arbidol. However, in a single randomized controlled trail (open label), chloroquine (CQ) performed better than L/R. The combination L/R with arbidol may be beneficial (in terms of virological clearance and radiological improvement); however, we need more dedicated studies. Single studies report efficacy of L/R + interferon (IFN, either alpha or 1-beta) combination. We need more studies to delineate the proper effect size. Regarding adverse effects, except occurrence of diarrhea (higher in the L/R group), safety was comparable to SOC. CONCLUSION: In our study, no difference was seen between the L/R combination and the SOC arm in terms of ""progression to more severe state,"" ""mortality,"" and virological cure on days 7-10;"" however, some benefits in terms of ""duration of hospital stay"" and ""time to virological cure"" were seen. No significant difference in efficacy was seen when L/R was compared to arbidol and HCQ monotherapy. Except for the occurrence of diarrhea, which was higher in the L/R group, safety profile of L/R is comparable to SOC. Compared to L/R combination, CQ, L/R + arbidol, L/R + IFN-&#945;, and L/R + IFN-1ß showed better efficacy, but the external validity of these findings is limited by limited number of studies (1 study each).","Bhattacharyya, Anusuya; Kumar, Subodh; Sarma, Phulen; Kaur, Hardeep; Prajapat, Manisha; Shekhar, Nishant; Bansal, Seema; Avti, Pramod; Hazarika, Mythili; Sharma, Saurabh; Mahendru, Dhruv; Prakash, Ajay; Medhi, Bikash",Indian J Pharmacol,279,1

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to illustrate the numerical effects of regulatory restrictions of elective surgery at an orthopaedic university hospital. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic all over the world places extraordinary demands on health care systems which are forced to ensure structural and personnel capacities. Consequently, hospitals may only perform urgent interventions. Spine patients, however, often need urgent surgery and, moreover, bear an above-average perioperative risk frequently requiring postoperative surveillance on intensive care units (ICUs). Facing this dilemma, we want to share our practice and its unexpected numerical effects. METHODS: We compare case statistics during normal operation, directly before and after implementation of regulatory measures. We also analyzed the differences in ICU utilization, complexity and duration of interventions and the patient population. RESULTS: Spine surgical interventions have been reduced by 42.7%. Regulatory restriction of ""elective surgeries"" in pandemic situations results in reduced ICU utilization, however in a disproportionate manner. Although other specialized surgeries can be reduced by 59%, surgical spine cases are only diminishable by 24%. The spine surgery-related ICU occupancy has been reduced by 35%. CONCLUSION: The disproportionate effect of case reduction needs to be considered while calculating resources released by regulatory limitation of ""elective surgeries"" on a (inter-)national level.","Laux, Christoph J; Bauer, David E; Kohler, Adrian; Uçkay, Ilker; Farshad, Mazda",Clin Spine Surg,279,24

We next discuss some of the beautiful classic frameworks to approach the issue.

In the second half, we present some of our own work in these directions, beginning with explorations of how the Neutral Naturalness approach motivates novel signatures of electroweak naturalness at a variety of physics frontiers. Finally, we propose a New Trail for Naturalness and suggest that the physical breakdown of EFT, which gravity demands, may be responsible for the violation of our EFT expectations at the LHC.","Koren, Seth",,279,16

(Letters #1 and #2),19.787107,4.347752,2020,"Cardiovascular diseases are the main cause of death worldwide, with sleep disordered breathing being a further aggravating factor. Respiratory illnesses are the third leading cause of death amongst the noncommunicable diseases. The current COVID-19 pandemic, however, also highlights the impact of communicable respiratory syndromes. In the clinical routine, prolonged postanesthetic respiratory instability worsens the patient outcome. Even though early and continuous, long-term cardiorespiratory monitoring has been proposed or even proven to be beneficial in several situations, implementations thereof are sparse. We employed our recently presented, multimodal patch stethoscope to estimate Einthoven electrocardiogram (ECG) Lead I and II from a single 55 mm ECG lead. Using the stethoscope and ECG subsystems, the pre-ejection period (PEP) and left ventricular ejection time (LVET) were estimated. ECG-derived respiration techniques were used in conjunction with a novel, phonocardiogram-derived respiration approach to extract respiratory parameters. Medical-grade references were the SOMNOmedics SOMNO HDTM and Osypka ICON-CoreTM. In a study including 10 healthy subjects, we analyzed the performances in the supine, lateral, and prone position. Einthoven I and II estimations yielded correlations exceeding 0.97. LVET and PEP estimation errors were 10% and 21%, respectively. Respiratory rates were estimated with mean absolute errors below 1.2 bpm, and the respiratory signal yielded a correlation of 0.66. We conclude that the estimation of ECG, PEP, LVET, and respiratory parameters is feasible using a wearable, multimodal acquisition device and encourage further research in multimodal signal fusion for respiratory signal estimation.","Klum, Michael; Urban, Mike; Tigges, Timo; Pielmus, Alexandru-Gabriel; Feldheiser, Aarne; Schmitt, Theresa; Orglmeister, Reinhold",,279,1

Pandemic-induced disruptions to conventional food production, distribution, and consumption networks have revealed problems with the global food system and have drawn attention to the re-localization and regionalization of food systems. Lockdown and mobility restrictions have also disrupted the availability, quality, and stability of food. We evaluate how AFNs have responded to these challenges in a non-western context through a case-study approach informed by participant observation and semistructured interviews. After examining the multiple factors that have been critical to the emergence and expansion of AFNs in Turkey since the mid-2000s, we argue that these food distribution networks have aimed to address food security, environmental sustainability, and farmer livelihoods in complementary ways. We provide a timeline of state-led measures in response to COVID-19 in Turkey as we consider their impacts on food distribution systems and access in urban areas. We then compare two AFNs: a food community working within a participatory guarantee system, and a consumer cooperative that connects producers and consumers in urban areas. Although the two AFNs faced initial challenges due to disruptions in delivery services and lockdowns, they have been able to continue their services and address increasing demand. They also provided special solidarity packages for those adversely affected by the economic impacts of COVID-19. By building on the existing networks and relationships of trust between consumers and producers, and the capacity and willingness of producers to adapt to the new regulatory environment, the two AFNs have been able to continue their activities and start new initiatives.","Atalan-Helicke, N.; Abiral, B.",Journal of Agriculture Food Systems and Community Development,279,20

Due to the common effective waste management practices in some parts of the world, the plastics’ menace is generally well recognized and controlled worldwide. However, some developing countries do not have acceptable waste management practices, resulting in significant environmental, social, and health cross-cutting issues. Plastic is a significant threat to the environment in Ghana, specifically the urban environment and oceans. The new paradigm shift of virtually using non-biodegradable plastics in all daily products sold increases plastic waste in the environment, which creates problems, such as choked drainage system and breeding places for insects. The scale of these issues requires innovative and practical ideas to help solve this problem. The paper shows how plastic waste is innovatively and creatively converted to artifacts and pavement blocks in Ghana. These innovative ideas have contributed to reduce the volume of plastic waste and enhance environmental sustainability in Africa.

The study aims to measure the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) volume in Scotland. Secondary objectives are to measure the success of restarting elective services and model the time required to bridge the gap left by the first period of suspension. METHODS: A retrospective observational study using the Scottish Arthroplasty Project dataset. All patients undergoing elective THAs and TKAs during the period 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2020 were included. A negative binomial regression model using historical case-volume and mid-year population estimates was built to project the future case-volume of THA and TKA in Scotland. The median monthly case volume was calculated for the period 2008 to 2019 (baseline) and compared to the actual monthly case volume for 2020. The time taken to eliminate the deficit was calculated based upon the projected monthly workload and with a potential workload between 100% to 120% of baseline. RESULTS: Compared to the period 2008 to 2019, primary TKA and THA volume fell by 61.1% and 53.6%, respectively. Since restarting elective services, Scottish hospitals have achieved approximately 40% to 50% of baseline monthly activity. With no changes in current workload, by 2021 there would be a reduction of 9,180 and 10,170 for THA and TKA, respectively. Conversely, working at 120% baseline monthly output, it would take over four years to eliminate the deficit for both TKA and THA. CONCLUSION: This national study demonstrates the significant impact that COVID-19 pandemic has had on overall THA and TKA volume.

An early assessment of illness severity is important for the stratification of patients. We analysed the predictive value of National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) for intensive care unit admission (ICU) in patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome- Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.Methods: Data of 71 patients with SARS-CoV-2 admitted from 1 March to 20 April 2020, to the Clinic of Infectious Diseases of Perugia Hospital, Italy, were retrospectively reviewed. NEWS2 at hospital admission, demographic, comorbidity and clinical data were collected. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to establish the correlation between each variable and ICU admission.Results: Among 68 patients included in the analysis, 27 were admitted to ICU. NEWS2 at hospital admission was a good predictor of ICU admission as shown by an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis of 0.90 (standard error 0.04; 95% confidence interval 0.82-0.97). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, NEWS2 was significantly related to ICU admission using thresholds of 5 and 7. No other clinical variables included in the model were significantly correlated with ICU admission.A NEWS2 threshold of 5 had higher sensitivity than a threshold of 7 (89% and 63%). Higher specificity, positive likelihood ratio and positive predictive value were found using a threshold of 7 than a threshold of 5.Conclusions: NEWS2 at hospital admission was a good predictor for ICU admission. Patients with severe COVID-19 were correctly and rapidly stratified.","Gidari, Anna; De Socio, Giuseppe Vittorio; Sabbatini, Samuele; Francisci, Daniela",Infect Dis (Lond),279,16

The reason for its prevalence being common in Indians finds its root from pregnancy, during fetal period and has emerged as a concept of 'Thin Fat Indian'. Malnutrition in such a critical period of growth has consequences in the form of reduced basal metabolic rate (BMR), reduced blood flow to growing tissues, reduced functional ability of vital organs, endocrine changes and reduced capacity of primary adipose tissue. However, excess of visceral fat facilitates high dosage of adipokines in the portal vein to liver and other body tissues having serious implications seen in the form NCDs like diabetes, hypertension, heart diseases, non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases, kidney disorders, cancer and other health problems.

Psychological resilience and finding ways to cope in crises is a highly relevant topic considering the COVID-19 pandemic, which enforced quarantine, social distancing measures, and school closures worldwide. Parents and children are currently living with increased stress due to COVID-19. We need to respond with immediate ways to strengthen children's resilience. Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy interventions for children's stress management overcome accessibility issues such as the inability to visit mental health experts owing to COVID-19 movement restrictions. An interactive learning environment was created, based on the preventive program ""Friends,"" to overcome accessibility issues associated with delivering cognitive behavioral therapy-based interventions in formal and informal education settings. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of a web-based learning environment on resilience in (1) reducing anxiety symptoms and (2) increasing emotion recognition and recognition of stress management techniques among 9-10-year-old children. We also aimed to evaluate the learning environment's usability. METHODS: A quasi-experimental pretest-posttest control group design was used. In total, 20 fourth graders in the experimental group interacted with the learning environment over 6 weekly 80-minute sessions. Further, 21 fourth graders constituted the control group. The main data sources were (1) a psychometric tool to measure children's anxiety symptoms, namely the Greek translation of the original Spence Children's Anxiety Scale, (2) 3 open-ended questions assessing emotion recognition and recognition of stress management techniques, and (3) the System Usability Scale to measure the usability of the learning environment. RESULTS: In both groups, there was a small but nonsignificant postintervention reduction in reported anxiety symptoms, except for obsessive-compulsive disorder symptoms in the experimental group. A paired samples t test revealed that students' reported symptom scores of obsessive-compulsive disorder significantly decreased from 1.06 (SD 0.68) to 0.76 (SD 0.61) (t19= 5.16; P=.01). The experimental group revealed a significant increase in emotion recognition (t19=-6.99; P<.001), identification of somatic symptoms of stress (t19=-7.31; P<.001), and identification of stress management techniques (t19=-6.85; P<.001). The learning environment received a satisfactory usability score. The raw average system usability score was 76.75 (SD 8.28), which is in the 80th percentile rank and corresponds to grade B. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that interactive learning environments might deliver resilience interventions in an accessible and cost-effective manner in formal education, potentially even in distance-learning conditions owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. Interactive learning environments on resilience are also valuable tools for parents who can use them with their children at home, for informal learning, using mobile devices. As such, they could be a promising first-step, low-intensity intervention that children and the youth can easily access.","Nicolaidou, Iolie; Stavrou, Evi; Leonidou, Georgia",JMIR Pediatr Parent,279,23

In this paper, we present a concept that is capable of processing live meeting audio and classifying transcribed statements into sentiment polarity classes. We combine the latest advances in open source speech recognition with previous research in sentiment analysis. We tested our approach on a student software project meeting to gain proof of concept, showing moderate agreement between the classifications of our tool and a human observer on the meeting audio. Despite the preliminary character of our study, we see promising results motivating future research in sentiment analysis on meetings. For example, the polarity classification can be extended to detect destructive behaviour that can endanger project success.","Herrmann, Marc; Klunder, Jil",,279,1

Link prediction is increasingly used especially in bipartite biomedical networks to identify hidden biological interactions and relationshipts between key entities such as compounds, targets, gene and diseases. We propose a Graph Neural Networks (GNN) method, namely Graph Pair based Link Prediction model (GPLP), for predicting biomedical network links simply based on their topological interaction information. In GPLP, 1-hop subgraphs extracted from known network interaction matrix is learnt to predict missing links. To evaluate our method, three heterogeneous biomedical networks were used, i.e. Drug-Target Interaction network (DTI), Compound-Protein Interaction network (CPI) from NIH Tox21, and Compound-Virus Inhibition network (CVI). Our proposed GPLP method significantly outperforms over the state-of-the-art baselines. In addition, different network incompleteness is analysed with our devised protocol, and we also design an effective approach to improve the model robustness towards incomplete networks.

We hypothesised that the first-attempt intubation success rate would be higher with tracheal tube + stylet than with tracheal tube alone. METHODS: In this multicentre randomised controlled trial, conducted in 32 intensive care units, we randomly assigned patients to tracheal tube + stylet or tracheal tube alone (i.e. without stylet). The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with first-attempt intubation success. The secondary outcome was the proportion of patients with complications related to tracheal intubation. Serious adverse events, i.e., traumatic injuries related to tracheal intubation, were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 999 patients were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis: 501 (50%) to tracheal tube + stylet and 498 (50%) to tracheal tube alone. First-attempt intubation success occurred in 392 patients (78.2%) in the tracheal tube + stylet group and in 356 (71.5%) in the tracheal tube alone group (absolute risk difference, 6.7; 95%CI 1.4-12.1; relative risk, 1.10; 95%CI 1.02-1.18; P = 0.01). A total of 194 patients (38.7%) in the tracheal tube + stylet group had complications related to tracheal intubation, as compared with 200 patients (40.2%) in the tracheal tube alone group (absolute risk difference, - 1.5; 95%CI - 7.5 to 4.6; relative risk, 0.96; 95%CI 0.83-1.12; P = 0.64). The incidence of serious adverse events was 4.0% and 3.6%, respectively (absolute risk difference, 0.4; 95%CI, - 2.0 to 2.8; relative risk, 1.10; 95%CI 0.59-2.06. P = 0.76).

Often, there are subtle physiological differences in these cohorts of patients. In particular, in intensive care, patients tend to be younger and have increased disease severity. Data, to date, has combined outcomes from medical and intensive care cohorts, or looked exclusively at intensive care. We looked solely at the level 1 (medical) cohort to identify their clinical characteristics and predictors of outcome. Patients and Methods: This was a retrospective study of adult patients admitted to a central London teaching hospital with a diagnosis of COVID-19 from 23rd March to 7th April 2020 identified from the hospital electronic database. Any patients who required level 2 or 3 care were excluded. Results: A total of 229 patients were included for analysis. Increased age and frailty scores were associated with increased 30-day mortality. Reduced renal function and elevated troponin blood levels are also associated with poor outcome. Baseline observations showed that increased oxygen requirement was predictive for mortality. A trend of increased mortality with lower diastolic blood pressure was noted. Lymphopenia was not shown to be related to mortality. Conclusion: Urea and creatinine are the best predictors of mortality in the level 1 cohort. Unlike previous intensive care data, lymphopenia is not predictive of mortality. We suggest that these factors be considered when prognosticating and for resource allocation for the treatment and escalation of care for patients with COVID-19 infection.","Moledina, Saadiq M; Maini, Alexander A; Gargan, Alice; Harland, William; Jenney, Heloise; Phillips, Georgina; Thomas, Kate; Chauhan, Devkishan; Fertleman, Michael",Int J Gen Med,279,29

However, limited concern has been paid to the potential dangers of lowering serum uric acid (SUA). We observed lower levels of SUA in patients with COVID-19. Therefore, we aim to explore whether patients with COVID-19 had SUA lower than normal and the relationship of SUA and the severity of COVID-19. METHODS: This was a case-control study based on 91 cases with COVID-19 and 273 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects. We first compared SUA levels and uric acid/creatinine (UA/Cr) ratio between patients with COVID-19 and the healthy controls. Then, we examined the association of SUA levels and UA/Cr ratios with COVID-19 severity in COVID-19 cases only, defined according to the fifth edition of China's Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines of COVID-19. RESULTS: SUA levels in patients with COVID-19 were 2.59% lower, UA/Cr ratios 6.06% lower at admission compared with healthy controls. In sex stratified analysis, levels of SUA and UA/Cr were lower in male patients with COVID-19 while only level of SUA was lower in female patients with COVID-19. Moreover, SUA and UA/Cr values were 4.27 and 8.23% lower in the severe group than that in the moderate group among male COVID-19 patients. Bivariate and partial correlations analysis showed negative correlations between SUA or UA/Cr ratio and COVID-19 after adjusting for age, sex, BMI and eGFR. A multiple linear regression analysis showed that SARS-CoV-2 infection and male sex were independent risk factors associated with lower SUA levels. Male patients with COVID-19 accompanied by low SUA levels had higher risk of developing severe symptoms than those with high SUA levels (incidence rate ratio: 4.05; 95% CI:1.11, 14.72) at admission. Comparing SUA and UA/Cr ratio at three time points (admission, discharge, and follow-up), we found that male patients experienced severe symptoms had lower SUA and UA/Cr ratio levels comparing to moderate patients, but no significant difference between three time points. On the contrary, female patients had lower SUA and UA/Cr ratio at discharge than those at admission, but no significant difference of SUA and UA/Cr ratio between moderate and severe group. CONCLUSION: Patients with COVID-19 had SUA and UA/Cr values lower than normal at admission. Male COVID-19 patients with low SUA levels had a significantly higher crude risk of developing severe symptoms than those with high SUA levels. During disease aggravation, the level of SUA gradually decreased until discharge. At the follow-up exam, the level of SUA was similar to the levels at admission.","Hu, Fang; Guo, Yifan; Lin, Jianghong; Zeng, Yingjuan; Wang, Juan; Li, Man; Cong, Li",BMC Endocr Disord,279,1

METHODS: Multicentre randomised case-control study that involved 18 patients with COVID-19 related anosmia or severe hyposmia for more than 30 days. Nine patients were prescribed systemic prednisone and nasal irrigation with betamethasone, ambroxol and rinazine for 15 days. The other 9, untreated, patients were used as controls. The olfactory function was evaluated with CCCRC test at 20 and 40 days from the first evaluation. RESULTS: In the control group, a median olfactory score of 20 (IQR 30) was detected at baseline. At the 20-day control there was no significant improvement in olfactory function. The improvement in olfactory performance became significant at the 40-day follow-up compared to baseline scores [60 (IQR 60) versus 20 (IQR 30)]. In the treatment group, patients had a mean olfactory score of 10 (IQR 15) at initial control.

In this research work our study is based on extensions of the well-known susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) family of compartmental models and later we observe the new model changes into (SEIR) without changing its physical meanings. The stability analysis of the coronavirus depends on changing of its basic reproductive ratio. The progress rate of the virus in the critically infected cases and the recovery rate have major roles to control this epidemic. The impact of social distancing, lockdown of the country, self-isolation, home quarantine and the wariness of global public health system have significant influence on the parameters of the model system that can alter the effect of recovery rates, mortality rates and active contaminated cases with the progression of time in the real world.

At present, conflicting data exists regarding patient safety for ambulatory (AMB) metabolic and bariatric surgery. OBJECTIVE: Outcomes for AMB-metabolic and bariatric surgery patients (LoS <1 d) undergoing laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or sleeve gastrectomy (SG) were compared with matched patients with LoS &#8805;1 day (non-AMB) using the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP) registry. SETTING: MBSAQIP national database. METHODS: The MBSAQIP registry was queried for patients undergoing SG or RYGB (2015-2017) and patients grouped as AMB/non-AMB. Exclusion criteria included LoS >4 days, age <18 or >75 years, revision surgery, gastric banding, body mass index <35 kg/m2, and day of surgery mortality. Variables were combined into major/minor complications and 30-day mortality. Analysis was performed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression and propensity matching. RESULTS: After exclusions were applied 408,895 patients remained (9973 AMB). Overall, 111,279 patients underwent RYGB (1032 AMB) and 297,616 underwent SG (8941 AMB), with similar demographic characteristics and co-morbidities between groups. For AMB patients, there was no increase in 30-day mortality, reoperation, or readmission, and fewer drains were placed versus matched non-AMB patients. In AMB-SG patients more surgical site infections were reported versus non-AMB-SG, although AMB-SG patients had fewer intensive care unit admissions. For AMB-RYGB, no differences in complications were detected versus non-AMB-RYGB. CONCLUSION: Based on our analysis of the MBSAQIP database, patients undergoing laparoscopic RYGB or SG procedures can be safely discharged on the day of their procedure without increased incidence of mortality, reoperation, or readmission.","Barbat, Selwan; Thompson, Kyle J; Mckillop, Iain H; Kuwada, Timothy S; Gersin, Keith; Nimeri, Abdelrahman",Surg. obes. relat. dis,279,24

Lack of rest leads to decreased concentration. The research topic is important for improving patient safety in hospitals. Assessment and analysis of the level of sleepiness of nurses after 3 consecutive night shifts and its impact on functioning in social life. The study adopted the diagnostic survey method, which was conducted using a survey technique. The questionnaire consisted of 3 parts: personal particulars, the survey and the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) version A. After the research, 164 correctly completed questionnaires were obtained. The level of somnolence in individual measurements after a night shift significantly increased among the nurses examined (P < .0001). Respondents who felt a higher level of drowsiness after a night shift thought that their work definitely influenced contact with their friends or family and had difficulty in performing household duties. There is no statistically significant relationship between the level of sleepiness and sociodemographic factors. After each night shift, the level of drowsiness in nurses increases. This may result in reduced alertness and attention levels on subsequent working days. Shift work has negative consequences in the form of depleted personal life. Further research into the effects of insufficient sleep among nurses should be conducted. This may be necessary for patient safety in healthcare centers. The awareness on the subject of healthy sleep among shift nurses should be raised. It is advisable to conduct research in order to assess the effectiveness of various therapies in dealing with sleep disorders among shift nurses.

Further, dietary intake of EC was evaluated, and the risk levels were assessed via the margin of exposure (MOE) approach and excess cancer risk assessment. EC contents of the condiments ranged from not detectable to 39.47 µg/kg, and the daily EC exposure ranged from 1.4 to 2.0 ng/kg BW per day, depending on gender and age groups in Korea. Of the condiments, soy sauce was the largest contributor to EC exposure.

This study assessed the effect of early intubation and mechanical ventilation on all-cause, inhospital mortality for coronavirus disease 2019 patients. Design: Multicenter retrospective cohort study. Setting: Eleven municipal hospitals in New York City from March 1, 2020, to December 1, 2020. Patients: Adult patients who tested positive for coronavirus disease 2019 in the emergency department were subsequently admitted. Patients with do-not-intubate orders at admission were excluded. Interventions: Intubation within 48 hours of triage and intubation at any point during hospital stay. Measurements and Main Results: Data from 7,597 coronavirus disease 2019 patients were included;of these, 1,628 (21%) were intubated overall and 807 (11%) were intubated within 48 hours of triage. After controlling for available confounders, intubation rates for coronavirus disease 2019 patients varied significantly across hospitals and decreased steadily as the pandemic progressed. After nearest neighbor propensity score matching, intubation within 48 hours of triage was associated with higher all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 1.30 [1.15-1.48];p &lt; 0.0001), as was intubation at any time point (hazard ratio, 1.62 [1.45-1.80];p &lt; 0.0001). Among intubated patients, intubation within 48 hours of triage was not significantly associated with differences in mortality (hazard ratio, 1.09 [0.94-1.26];p = 0.26). These results remained robust to multiple sensitivity analyses.

Based on the available non-pharmacological interventions like wearing of face masks, observing social distancing, and lockdown, this work assesses the impact of non-pharmaceutical control measures (social distancing and use of face-masks) and mass testing on the transmission of COVID-19 in Nigeria. A mathematical model for COVID-19 is formulated with intervention measures (observing social distancing and wearing of face masks) and mass testing. The basic reproduction number, R_0, is computed using next-generation method while the disease-free equilibrium is found to be locally and globally asymptotically stable when R_0&lt; 1. The model is parameterized using Nigeria data on COVID-19 in Nigeria. The basic reproduction number is found to be less than unity (R_0 &lt; 1) either when the compliance with intervention measures is moderate (50% &lt;= alpha&lt; 70%) and the testing rate per day is moderate (0,5 &lt;=alpha_2 &lt; 0,7) or when the compliance with intervention measures is strict (alpha&gt;=70%) and the testing rate per day is poor (alpha_2 = 0,3). This implies that Nigeria will be able to halt the spread of COVID-19 under these two conditions. However, it will be easier to enforce strict compliance with intervention measures in the presence of poor testing rate due to the limited availability of testing facilities and manpower in Nigeria. Hence, this study advocates that Nigerian governments (Federal and States) should aim at achieving a testing rate of at least 0.3 per day while ensuring that all the citizens strictly comply with wearing face masks and observing social distancing in public.","Madubueze, Chinwendu Emilian; Akabuike, Nkiru Maria; Dachollom, Sambo; en,",Communication In Biomathematical Sciences,279,24

The precise neural circuitry and mechanisms involved in communicating affective states are not well understood. Over the past few years, a number of important observations in rodent models have increased our knowledge of the neural processes for social communication of affective state. Here we highlight these contributions by first describing the rodent models used to investigate social communication of affect and then summarising the neural circuitry and processes implicated by these rodent models.

Many people were caught in anxiety and panic, which also prevents people from fully concentrating on their normal lives. However, the current common neurofeedback therapies used to solve the problem of lack of attention cannot fully deal with the differences in each individual. In addition, direct contact between the patient and the doctor also increases the risk of virus transmission during treatment. This article combines neurofeedback and IoT to establish an adaptive attention adjustment method. IoT connects patients and doctors remotely, reducing the direct contact between them. In order to adapt to individual differences, the feedback indicators of each individual are individually calibrated. In addition, the PID controller was used to adjust the difficulty of the feedback task to adapt to each individual&#x2019;s self-regulation ability and provide the individual with a higher level of regulation. We also designed adaptive attention adjustment experiments for different individuals. The results show that through adaptive feedback training, the individual&#x2019;s feedback indicator has dropped by 77.90%, and the individual can adjust his attention state to the individual&#x2019;s optimal baseline threshold, and the oscillation error gradually reduces to the expected threshold range. This method can cope with the differences between different individuals and provide each individual with the same level of feedback regulation.

We calculated the; seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in HCW at Eastern Health, a tertiary healthcare network in Victoria, and assessed associations with demographics, work location and role. METHODS: A cross-sectional cohort study of HCW at Eastern Health was conducted. Serum was analysed for the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, and all participants completed; an online survey collecting information on demographics, place of work, role, and exposures; to COVID-19. Seroprevalence was calculated as the proportion participants with SARS-CoV-2; antibodies out of all tested individuals. RESULTS: The crude seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in this study was 2.17% (16/736). Thirteen of the 16 (81.2%) positive cases had previously been diagnosed with COVID-19 by PCR: the seroprevalence in the group not previously diagnosed with COVID by PCR was 0.42% (3/720). Having direct contact with COVID-19 patients did not increase the likelihood of having positive serology. A prior history of symptoms consistent with COVID-19 was associated with a higher likelihood of having positive serology (OR 17.2, p = 0.006, 95%CI: 2.25-131.55). CONCLUSION: Our calculated seroprevalence of 2.17% is higher than estimated in the general Australian population, but lower than that reported in HCW internationally. The; majority of those with positive serology in our study had previously been diagnosed with COVID-19 by PCR based testing. Seropositivity was not associated with interaction with COVID-19 positive patients, highlighting effective infection prevention and control practices within the workplace.","Lau, Jillian Sy; Buntine, Paul; Price, Melanie; Darzins, Peteris; Newnham, Evan; Connell, Ailie; Chean, Roy; Edwards, Glenn; Guy, Stephen",Infect Dis Health,279,15

We aimed to (a) quantify the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on accelerometer-assessed physical activity and sleep in people with type 2 diabetes and (b) identify predictors of physical activity during COVID-19 restrictions. METHODS: Participants were from the UK Chronotype of Patients with type 2 diabetes and Effect on Glycaemic Control (CODEC) observational study. Participants wore an accelerometer on their wrist for 8 days before and during COVID-19 restrictions. Accelerometer outcomes included the following: overall physical activity, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), time spent inactive, days/week with &#8805;30-minute continuous MVPA and sleep. Predictors of change in physical activity taken pre-COVID included the following: age, sex, ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), socio-economic status and medical history. RESULTS: In all, 165 participants (age (mean±S.D = 64.2 ± 8.3 years, BMI=31.4 ± 5.4 kg/m2 , 45% women) were included. During restrictions, overall physical activity was lower by 1.7 mg (~800 steps/day) and inactive time 21.9 minutes/day higher, but time in MVPA and sleep did not statistically significantly change. In contrast, the percentage of people with &#8805;1 day/week with &#8805;30-minute continuous MVPA was higher (34% cf. 24%). Consistent predictors of lower physical activity and/or higher inactive time were higher BMI and/or being a woman. Being older and/or from ethnic minorities groups was associated with higher inactive time. CONCLUSIONS: Overall physical activity, but not MVPA, was lower in adults with type 2 diabetes during COVID-19 restrictions. Women and individuals who were heavier, older, inactive and/or from ethnic minority groups were most at risk of lower physical activity during restrictions.","Rowlands, Alex V; Henson, Joseph J; Coull, Nicole A; Edwardson, Charlotte L; Brady, Emer; Hall, Andrew; Khunti, Kamlesh; Davies, Melanie; Yates, Tom",Diabet Med,279,20

Serological testing provides a powerful tool for the identification of prior infection and for epidemiological studies. Pseudotype virus neutralization assays are widely used for many viruses and applications in the fields of serology. The accuracy of pseudotype neutralizing assay allows for its use in low biosafety lab and provides a safe and effective alternative to the use of wild-type viruses. In this study, we evaluated the performance of this assay compared to the standard microneutralization assay as a reference. The lentiviral pseudotype particles were generated harboring the Spike gene of SARS-CoV-2. The generated pseudotype particles assay was used to evaluate the activity of neutralizing antibodies in 300 human serum samples from a COVID-19 sero-epidemiological study. Testing of these samples resulted in 55 positive samples and 245 negative samples by pseudotype viral particles assay while microneutralization assay resulted in 64 positive and 236 negative by MN assay. Compared to the MN, the pseudotyped viral particles assay showed a sensitivity of 85.94% and a specificity of 100%. Based on the data generated from this study, the pseudotype-based neutralization assay showed a reliable performance for the detection of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and can be used safely and efficiently as a diagnostic tool in a biosafety level 2 laboratory.","Tolah, A.

It is understandable that this impact on operations of donor human milk might hamper the capability of these milk banks to provide sufficient pasteurized donor milk to neonates who need it. Contrary to developed world, predominant donors in developing nations are mothers of hospitalised neonates who have a relatively long period of hospital stay. This longer maternal hospital stay enhances the feasibility of milk donation by providing mothers with access to breast pumps to express their milk. Any excess milk a mother expresses which is above the needs of their own infant can be voluntarily donated. This physical proximity of milk banks to donors may help continuation of human milk donation in developing nations during the pandemic. Nevertheless, protocols need to be implemented to i) ensure the microbiological quality of the milk collected and ii) consider steps to mitigate potential consequences related to the possibility of the donor being an asymptomatic carrier of COVID-19.

Patients are often extremely frail with multiple comorbidities and so are at high risk of death should they contract COVID-19. This study aims to quantify the effects of COVID-19 on patients presenting with hip fractures to the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital (NNUH). METHODS: This is a single centre, prospective, observational cohort study of patients over the age of sixty admitted with a hip fracture to NNUH between March 24th and April 22nd, 2020 and comparing them retrospectively with controls in April 2019. Patients were followed up for 30 days; data collected includes demographics, COVID-19 PCR results, date/cause of death and other prognostic indicators. RESULTS: 66 consecutive patients managed for hip fractures were included in the study. 30-day mortality increased from 8.5% in April 2019 to 18.2% in April 2020. The 30-day mortality rate was 80% for those patients who test positive for COVID-19 as an inpatient, and was 13.8% for patients COVID-19 negative and for those who were untested. Those admitted from a healthcare institution were more likely to test positive for COVID-19 and had a higher 30-day mortality (p = 0.04 & p = 0.006, respectively). Suspected COVID-19-positive patients at time of admission had a delayed time to theatre, 46.7 h versus 27.1 h (p = 0.007), however this had no significant effect on mortality (p = 0.7). CONCLUSIONS: The combination of fragility hip fracture and COVID-19 is associated with poor outcomes. COVID-19 has also indirectly increased mortality in this patient group.","Barker, Thomas; Thompson, Joshua; Corbett, James; Johal, Sim; McNamara, Iain",Eur. j. trauma emerg. surg,279,16

METHODS: This prospective cohort study surveyed nurses three times - surveying personal factors, working conditions, family dynamics, and attitude towards COVID-19 - between March 31 and May 4, 2020. Nurses' mental health was assessed through Depression Anxiety Stress Scales - short version (DASS-21); their sleep quality was assessed through a 5-point Likert scale question. RESULTS: Nurses' sleep quality and symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress presented a positive variation over the COVID-19 outbreak. The only factors which are directly related to the COVID-19 outbreak and that were associated with the positive variation in nurses' symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress were the fear to infect others and the fear to be infected (higher fear of being infected or to infect someone corresponded to increased symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress). CONCLUSIONS: Although the COVID-19 outbreak seems to have had an immediate impact on nurses' mental health, a psychological adaptation phenomenon was also observed. Future research should focus on assessing nurses' symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress, after the COVID-19 pandemic, in order to compare and contrast the findings with the results of our study.","Sampaio, Francisco; Sequeira, Carlos; Teixeira, Laetitia",Environ Res,279,21

Although infrequent, neuropsychiatric symptoms have been reported in patients who received chloroquine for the treatment of malaria or autoimmune diseases. In this study, aiming to investigate these adverse events (AEs) using a large self-reporting database, we conducted a disproportionality analysis for the detection of neuropsychiatric AE signals associated with the use of chloroquine (or hydroxychloroquine), reported to FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database between the fourth quarter of 2012 and the fourth quarter of 2019. We included 2,389,474 AE cases, among which 520 cases developed neuropsychiatric AE following the use of chloroquine. Adjusted reporting odds ratio (ROR) for the development of each of the neuropsychiatric AEs following the use of chloroquine was calculated using a multilevel model: exposure to chloroquine was associated with a statistically significant high reporting of amnesia, delirium, hallucinations, depression, and loss of consciousness, (lower 95% confidence interval of the adjusted ROR > 1), although the degree of increase in their ROR was limited. There was no statistically significant high reporting of any other neuropsychiatric AE, including suicide, psychosis, confusion, and agitation. Current pharmacovigilance study results did not suggest any potential link between the use of chloroquine and an increased risk of suicide, psychosis, confusion, and agitation, which would be informative during the emergency use of chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19.","Sato, Kenichiro; Mano, Tatsuo; Iwata, Atsushi; Toda, Tatsushi",Biosci Trends,279,29

Nevertheless, the novel SARS-CoV-2 of bat ancestral origin emerged to infect humans in Wuhan, China, in late 2019 and then became a global pandemic. Less than 5 months after its emergence, millions of people worldwide have been infected asymptomatically or symptomatically and at least 360,000 have died. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in severely affected patients includes atypical pneumonia characterized by a dry cough, persistent fever, and progressive dyspnea and hypoxia, sometimes accompanied by diarrhea and often followed by multiple organ failure, especially of the respiratory and cardiovascular systems. In this minireview, we focus on two endemic respiratory CoV infections of livestock: bovine coronavirus (BCoV) and porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV). Both animal respiratory CoVs share some common features with SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. BCoV has a broad host range including wild ruminants and a zoonotic potential. BCoV also has a dual tropism for the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. These aspects, their interspecies transmission, and certain factors that impact disease severity in cattle parallel related facets of SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 in humans. PRCV has a tissue tropism for the upper and lower respiratory tracts and a cellular tropism for type 1 and 2 pneumocytes in lung but is generally a mild infection unless complicated by other exacerbating factors, such as bacterial or viral coinfections and immunosuppression (corticosteroids).","Saif, Linda J; Jung, Kwonil",J. clin. microbiol,279,16

Herein, we present a method for 3D printing a temperature resistant nylon copolymer on a common low-cost 3D printer. We show that the resulting parts can be autoclaved without deformation, and conduct uniaxial tensile testing showing that autoclaving the material does not result in substantial degradation of material properties. As a result, we demonstrate the capability to manufacture autoclavable PPE on low-cost consumer 3D printers with only minor modification.","Hemminger, Hannelore; Zheng, Xiaoyu",,279,1

Both are caused by human behaviors, and some of those behaviors contribute to both pandemics at the same time. Both illustrate the fact that isolation is not an option; these are global issues that inescapably affect all persons and all nations. Both incur prodigious current and anticipated costs. Both have similar societal impacts, and disproportionately harm those with lesser resources, widening the gap between the 'haves and the have-nots.'

METHODS: This retrospective case-control study involves subjects (7-98 years) presenting at the designated national outbreak screening center and tertiary care hospital in Singapore for SARS-CoV-2 testing from 26 January to 16 February 2020. COVID-19 status was confirmed by PCR testing of sputum, nasopharyngeal swabs, or throat swabs. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and exposure-risk variables ascertainable at presentation were analyzed to develop an algorithm for estimating the risk of COVID-19. Model development used Akaike's information criterion in a stepwise fashion to build logistic regression models, which were then translated into prediction scores. Performance was measured using receiver operating characteristic curves, adjusting for overconfidence using leave-one-out cross-validation. RESULTS: The study population included 788 subjects, of whom 54 (6.9%) were SARS-CoV-2 positive and 734 (93.1%) were SARS-CoV-2 negative. The median age was 34 years, and 407 (51.7%) were female. Using leave-one-out cross-validation, all the models incorporating clinical tests (models 1, 2, and 3) performed well with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) of 0.91, 0.88, and 0.88, respectively. In comparison, model 4 had an AUC of 0.65.

Updating these indicators before a second wave is essential in order to prepare for additional help. METHODS: From mid-May to mid-December 2020, weekly surveys were undertaken in sampled streets from 10 health areas to quantify the use of barrier measures, and interview pedestrians about sickness and deaths in their households. Crude death rates (CDRs) were estimated. RESULTS: Minimal use or no use of face masks was observed in at least half of the streets. From May to December 2020, the number of suspected cases of COVID-19 increased six-fold (P < 0.05). Of deaths within 30 days preceding the interviews, 20% were considered to be related to COVID-19. The monthly CDRs at the beginning and end of the study were approximately 5 and 25 per 1000 population, respectively (P < 0.05); that is, annual CDRs of 60 and 260 per 1000 population, respectively. Thus, during the first wave, the estimated mortality rate increased by 50% compared with previous years, and increased at least four-fold by the end of 2020.

We performed a literature search on PubMed, medRxiv, Web of Science, and Scopus to identify studies published up to December 10th, 2020 that examined the efficacy of convalescent plasma treatment for COVID-19. The primary endpoints were mortality, clinical improvement, and hospital length of stay. We screened 859 studies that met the search criteria, performed full-text reviews of 56 articles, and identified 15 articles that fulfilled inclusion criteria for meta-analysis. The odds of mortality were significantly lower in the convalescent plasma group compared to the control group (OR = 0.59 [95% CI = 0.44; 0.78], P < .001), although results from two key randomized controlled trials did not support the mortality benefit. The odds of clinical improvement were significantly higher in the convalescent plasma group compared to the control group (OR = 2.02 [95% CI = 1.54; 2.65], P < .001). There was no difference in hospital length of stay between the convalescent plasma group and the control group (MD = -0.49 days [95% CI = -3.11; 2.12], P = .713). In all, these data indicate that a mortality benefit with convalescent plasma is unclear, although there remain benefits with convalescent plasma therapy for COVID-19.","Vegivinti, Charan T R; Pederson, John M; Saravu, Kavitha; Gupta, Nitin; Evanson, Kirk W; Kamrowski, Shelby; Schmidt, Megan; Barrett, Averi; Trent, Hannah; Dibas, Mahmoud; Reierson, Natalie L; Mikoff, Nick; Pisipati, Sailaja; Joseph, Betsy A; Selvan, Pragadeesh T; Dmytriw, Adam A; Pulakurthi, Yashwitha S; Keesari, Praneeth R; Sriram, Varsha; Chittajallu, Spandana; Brinjikji, Waleed; Katamreddy, Rewanth R; Chibbar, Richa; Davis, Amber R; Malpe, Manashree; Mishra, Hemant K; Kallmes, Kevin M; Hassan, Ameer E",,279,1

Most kindergarten through grade 12 (K-12) public and private schools in Florida reopened for in-person learning during August 2020, with varying options for remote learning offered by school districts. During August 10-December 21, 2020, a total of 63,654 COVID-19 cases were reported in school-aged children; an estimated 60% of these cases were not school-related. Fewer than 1% of registered students were identified as having school-related COVID-19 and <11% of K-12 schools reported outbreaks. District incidences among students correlated with the background disease incidence in the county; resumption of in-person education was not associated with a proportionate increase in COVID-19 among school-aged children. Higher rates among students were observed in smaller districts, districts without mandatory mask-use policies, and districts with a lower proportion of students participating in remote learning. These findings highlight the importance of implementing both community-level and school-based strategies to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and suggest that school reopening can be achieved without resulting in widespread illness among students in K-12 school settings.","Doyle, Timothy; Kendrick, Katherine; Troelstrup, Thomas; Gumke, Megan; Edwards, Jerri; Chapman, Shay; Propper, Randy; Rivkees, Scott A; Blackmore, Carina",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,279,1

The use of 5&#945;-reductase inhibitor (5-ARI) is restricted to the patients with large prostate volumes, whose symptoms are refractory to antiandrogens or &#945;- adrenergic blockers Out of the various synthesized5-reductase inhibitors with different substituents on steroidal nucleus, esters have been found to exhibited high anti-androgenic activity. METHODS: In our attempt to find new, safer and potent 5-ARI and our continued interest in azasteorids, esters of 17a-Aza-Dhomo-5-androsten-3ß-ol with synergistic effect were synthesized and characterized using different analytical techniques. The compounds were evaluated for their 5&#945;-reductase inhibitory activity in-vivo by their effect on serum androgen level by ELISA assay procedure. The interaction with receptors was studied using advanced docking programme to predict the correlation of the synthesized compounds with actual biological activity. RESULTS: The target compounds (6-12) showed increased anti-androgenic activity as compared to finasteride and control, which imply that the target compounds are effective in inhibiting 5&#945;-reductase. Particularly, compound 6 showing highest inhibitory activity and greater affinity for 5-AR receptor with highest dock score. Results of these studies when compared with Finasteride showed increased solubility and dissolution of target compound 6. CONCLUSION: Compound6 showed immense potential with improved efficacy and better bioavailability, thus makes it a suitable candidate for further studies and optimal formulation.","Rana, Priyanka; Dhingra, Neelima; Arora, Poonam; Dhingra, Richa; Chauhan, Monika; Gupta, Ankit",,279,16

The inclusion and exclusion criteria for the data sources are not reported in the manuscript.Study selection The authors included six studies on the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 in humans. Studies comprised of two randomised controlled trials, two non-randomised trials both of which were non-blinded and open-label and one that was uncontrolled, a prospective cohort study and an interim report. The authors did not report details of any studies that were excluded.Data extraction and synthesis The data extraction methodology was not reported and it is unclear if the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. Treatment regimens and the study outcomes were extracted where available and overall findings were presented in a table. There were no comparable outcome measures; therefore, results were deemed unsuitable to combine and no statistical analyses were carried out. A narrative synthesis of each study is presented.Results The results of the studies in this rapid review are difficult to quantify as each study had different outcome parameters. Due to the heterogeneity of the studies, results were not combined, and no statistical analysis was carried out. Narrative synthesis of each of the included studies identified important and significant limitations, precluding the studies from demonstrating a statistically significant difference in outcomes.Conclusions This review highlights the urgent need for more high quality evidence on the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. The results of the studies included should be interpreted with caution due to the weak supporting data and numerous methodological limitations. The authors suggested that the studies be viewed as hypothesis-generating and should not be used in decision making around the recommendations and guidelines in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. There are currently several ongoing randomised controlled trials looking at the effectiveness and efficacy of these drugs on COVID-19. It is hoped the outcome of these studies can help guide future recommendations and national guidelines.","Wright, Christopher; Ross, Carly; Mc Goldrick, Niall",Evid Based Dent,279,23

Ultimately, our knowledge about the biological activity of these factors allowed us to better understand how the immune system functions in the context of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases leading to the development of targeted biologic therapies. The study of cytokine signal transduction led to the discovery of Janus kinases (JAK), and the consideration of therapeutically targeting JAKs to treat immune and inflammatory diseases. This year also marks the tenth anniversary of the approval of the first JAK inhibitor (jakinib) and now there are a total of nine approved jakinibs for treatment of rheumatologic, dermatologic, gastrointestinal, and neoplastic indications and most recently COVID-19. Here, we summarized the discoveries that led to development of first-generation jakinibs, discussed some of the newer, possibly more selective jakinibs, as well as jakinibs that also target other kinases. We also illustrated the rationale behind the application of these drugs in the treatment of COVID-19 cytokine storm. In this review, we will discuss the clinical success of jakinibs, the gaps in our understanding of their biological activities as well as challenges in regard to their clinical application.","Spinelli, Francesca Romana; Meylan, Françoise; O039,; Shea, John J; Gadina, Massimo",Eur. j. immunol,279,30

Evaluating the total objective function value for disease control models with hundreds of thousands of control time periods is a high computational cost. In this paper, we improve the conventional Bayesian Optimization (BO) approach from two parts. The existing BO methods optimize the minimizer step for once time during each acquisition function update process. To find a better solution for each acquisition function update, we do more local minimization steps to tune the algorithm. When the model is high dimensions, and the objective function is complicated, only some update iterations of the acquisition function may not find the global optimal solution. The IBO algorithm adds a series of Adam-based steps at the final stage of the algorithm to increase the solution's accuracy. Comparative simulation experiments using different kernel functions and acquisition functions have shown that the Improved Bayesian Optimization algorithm is effective and suitable for handing large-scale and complex epidemic models under study. The IBO algorithm is then compared with four other global optimization algorithms on three well-known synthetic test functions. The effectiveness and robustness of the IBO algorithm are also demonstrated through some simulation experiments to compare with the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm and Random Search algorithm. With its reliable convergence behaviors and straightforward implementation, the IBO algorithm has a great potential to solve other complex optimal control problems with high dimensionality.","Chen, Yuyang; Bi, Kaiming; Wu, Chih-Hang J.; Ben-Arieh, David; Sinha, Ashesh",,279,24

One of the effects is that teaching and learning activities cannot be done in campus, thus Teacher Professional Education or PPG (Pendidikan Profesi Guru) that used to be conducted in campus, should be carried out online by using LMS (Learning Management System) called SIM PKB. The problem is that the students are not familiar with the LMS used, which cause most of them to experience technical problems in the process of the digital learning. This condition requires the class administrators to guide them in using the LMS. This article discusses the use of a screen recorder application to guide PPG students’ learning. This research was conducted by observing the digital learning activities of PPG students in SIM PKB LMS before and after watching a video tutorial made using screen recorder application. The results show that the use of screen recorder is effective in helping class administrators to guide the students in operating the LMS. Before the video tutorial was published, there was a virtual meeting with the same objective. However, still, there were so many inquiries about particular functions in the LMS. After the video tutorial was given to the students, there was no more complain regarding technical problems, because the video tutorials can be played repeatedly. Once the video downloaded, the students can play it despite their unstable internet connections. In this case, screen recorders can also save more on the internet quota consumption. © 2021.

This systematic review critically evaluates and synthesises the relevant peer-reviewed and pre-print literature published from 01/01/2020-26/06/2020. METHODS: For this systematic review, keyword-structured literature searches were carried out in MEDLINE, Embase and COVID-19 Primer. Papers were independently screened by two researchers, with arbitration of disagreements by a third researcher. Data were independently extracted into a pre-designed Excel template and studies critically appraised using a modified version of the MetaQAT tool, with resolution of disagreements by consensus. Findings were narratively synthesised. RESULTS: 61 articles were included. 55 (90%) studies used observational designs, 50 (82%) involved hospitalised patients with higher acuity illness, and the majority had important limitations. Symptomatic adult COVID-19 cases consistently show peripheral T cell lymphopenia, which positively correlates with increased disease severity, duration of RNA positivity, and non-survival; while asymptomatic and paediatric cases display preserved counts. People with severe or critical disease generally develop more robust, virus-specific T cell responses. T cell memory and effector function has been demonstrated against multiple viral epitopes, and, cross-reactive T cell responses have been demonstrated in unexposed and uninfected adults, but the significance for protection and susceptibility, respectively, remains unclear. CONCLUSION: A complex pattern of T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 infection has been demonstrated, but inferences regarding population level immunity are hampered by significant methodological limitations and heterogeneity between studies, as well as a striking lack of research in asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic individuals. In contrast to antibody responses, population-level surveillance of the T cell response is unlikely to be feasible in the near term. Focused evaluation in specific sub-groups, including vaccine recipients, should be prioritised.","Shrotri, Madhumita; van Schalkwyk, May C I; Post, Nathan; Eddy, Danielle; Huntley, Catherine; Leeman, David; Rigby, Samuel; Williams, Sarah V; Bermingham, William H; Kellam, Paul; Maher, John; Shields, Adrian M; Amirthalingam, Gayatri; Peacock, Sharon J; Ismail, Sharif A",PLoS One,279,15

Currently, approximately 8.8 million people have already been infected and more than 465,740 people have died worldwide. An important step in combating COVID-19 is the screening of infected patients using chest X-ray (CXR) images. However, this task is extremely time-consuming and prone to variability among specialists owing to its heterogeneity. Therefore, the present study aims to assist specialists in identifying COVID-19 patients from their chest radiographs, using automated computational techniques. The proposed method has four main steps: (1) the acquisition of the dataset, from two public databases;(2) the standardization of images through preprocessing;(3) the extraction of features using a deep features-based approach implemented through the networks VGG19, Inception-v3, and ResNet50;(4) the classifying of images into COVID-19 groups, using eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) optimized by particle swarm optimization (PSO). In the best-case scenario, the proposed method achieved an accuracy of 98.71%, a precision of 98.89%, a recall of 99.63%, and an F1-score of 99.25%. In our study, we demonstrated that the problem of classifying CXR images of patients under COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 conditions can be solved efficiently by combining a deep features-based approach with a robust classifier (XGBoost) optimized by an evolutionary algorithm (PSO). The proposed method offers considerable advantages for clinicians seeking to tackle the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Dias Júnior, Domingos Alves da Cruz Luana Batista Bandeira Diniz João Otávio França da Silva Giovanni Lucca Junior Geraldo Braz Silva Aristófanes Corrêa de Paiva Anselmo Cardoso Nunes Rodolfo Acatauassú Gattass Marcelo",Expert Systems with Applications,279,33

We provide here bio-informatic, evolutionary analysis of 351 available sequences of its genome with the aim of mapping genome structural variations and the patterns of selection. METHODS: A Maximum likelihood tree has been built and selective pressure has been investigated in order to find any mutation developed during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic that could potentially affect clinical evolution of the infection. FINDING: We have found in more recent isolates the presence of two mutations affecting the Non-Structural Protein 6 (NSP6) and the Open Reding Frame10 (ORF 10) adjacent regions. Amino acidic change stability analysis suggests both mutations could confer lower stability of the protein structures. INTERPRETATION: One of the two mutations, likely developed within the genome during virus spread, could affect virus intracellular survival. Genome follow-up of SARS-CoV-2 spread is urgently needed in order to identify mutations that could significantly modify virus pathogenicity.","Benvenuto, Domenico; Angeletti, Silvia; Giovanetti, Marta; Bianchi, Martina; Pascarella, Stefano; Cauda, Roberto; Ciccozzi, Massimo; Cassone, Antonio",J Infect,279,22

The interaction between microbes and hosts is a reciprocal relationship, which remains largely under-explored. Current computational resources lack manually and consistently curated data to connect metagenomic data to pathogenic microbes, microbial core genes, and disease phenotypes. We developed the MicroPhenoDB database by manually curating and consistently integrating microbe-disease association data. MicroPhenoDB provides 5677 non-redundant associations between 1781 microbes and 542 human disease phenotypes across more than 22 human body sites. MicroPhenoDB also provides 696,934 relationships between 27,277 unique clade-specific core genes and 685 microbes. Disease phenotypes are classified and described using the Experimental Factor Ontology (EFO). A refined score model was developed to prioritize the associations based on evidential metrics. The sequence search option in MicroPhenoDB enables rapid identification of existing pathogenic microbes in samples without running the usual metagenomic data processing and assembly. MicroPhenoDB offers data browsing, searching, and visualization through user-friendly web interfaces and web service application programming interfaces. MicroPhenoDB is the first database platform to detail the relationships between pathogenic microbes, core genes, and disease phenotypes.

The results show significant lower tail dependence and upper tail independence between oil and non-ferrous metals markets. The lower temporal dependence is positive and heterogeneous between oil and non-ferrous markets and intensified during the onset of the global financial crisis (GFC) for copper, lead, and tin markets. The upside and downside spillovers from oil to non-ferrous markets and vice versa is significant and increased during times of GFC, oil price crash, and COVID-19 outbreak. The highest spillover effects are observed for the aluminum market, which is very vulnerable to oil price instabilities. Moreover, the spillover effects are asymmetric for all markets. Finally, we find that the CDB for aluminum and nickel are quite similar, and for lead, tin and zinc are also closed the same.

The proportion of persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 whose infection remained subclinical is not known. However, such information is important to determine whether the control measures currently employed are sufficient to halt the spread of the virus. Current study has examined the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a population of 92 healthcare professionals working with patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test system for SARS-CoV-2 IgG from EUROIMMUN Medizinische Labordiagnostika AG (Germany) was used. Very low herd antibody-mediated immunity was proven, less than 2%, although we have been faced with the COVID-19 pandemic for several months. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody testing is currently unable to provide sufficient information about our anti-infectious immunity.","Malickova, Karin; Kratka, Zuzana; Luxova, Stepanka; Bortlik, Martin; Lukas, Milan",Scand J Gastroenterol,279,15

Badges are a validated, online graphical representation of an achievement, which is accomplished by undertaking criteria-based learning activities. Despite the established educational benefits of badges in higher education, limited research has been conducted into employer awareness, acceptance, and use of digital badges in recruitment practices. To address this research gap, a mixed method study combining quantitative and qualitative data collection was conducted before and during the COVID-19 health pandemic. Approximately 700 employers were emailed and invited to complete the initial survey and 73 responded. One of the major survey findings is that 97% of respondents were unfamiliar with the concept of digital badges. Significantly, however, despite the lack of employer awareness there was no widespread resistance to the concept of badges, but a strong appeal for further clarification of their value, credibility, and security. Analysis of the data reveals stronger partnership working, between the higher education sector and employers, is pivotal to establish effective digital credentialing systems. Recommendations for higher education institutions have emerged from this study, which aim to balance pedagogical digital badge practice with employer needs. Such synergies are crucial to address the changing skills agenda, to prepare students to thrive in physical and virtual work environments. Given the paucity of research in this field, further studies are warranted, to investigate the impact of digital badges on the employer community. © 2021 Deakin University.

While isolating antibodies from animals and humans are proven approaches, these methods are limited to the affinities, specificities, and functional activities of antibodies generated by the immune system. Here we report a surprisingly simple directed evolution method for generating nanobodies with high affinities and neutralization activities against SARS-CoV-2. We demonstrate that complementarity-determining region swapping between low-affinity lead nanobodies, which we discovered unintentionally but find is simple to implement systematically, results in matured nanobodies with unusually large increases in affinity. Importantly, the matured nanobodies potently neutralize both SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and live virus, and possess drug-like biophysical properties. We expect that our methods will improve in vitro nanobody discovery and accelerate the generation of potent neutralizing nanobodies against diverse coronaviruses.","Zupancic, Jennifer M; Desai, Alec A; Schardt, John S; Pornnoppadol, Ghasidit; Makowski, Emily K; Smith, Matthew D; Kennedy, Andrew A; Garcia de Mattos Barbosa, Mayara; Cascalho, Marilia; Lanigan, Thomas M; Tai, Andrew W; Tessier, Peter M",Cell Chem.

Despite tremendous challenges, community-wide efforts have led to a variety of novel approaches for predicting drug polypharmacology. In particular, some rapid advances using machine learning and artificial intelligence have been reported with great success. AREAS COVERED: In this article, the authors provide a comprehensive update on the current state-of-the-art polypharmacology approaches and their applications, focusing on those reports published after our 2017 review article. The authors particularly discuss some novel, groundbreaking concepts, and methods that have been developed recently and applied to drug polypharmacology studies. EXPERT OPINION: Polypharmacology is evolving and novel concepts are being introduced to counter the current challenges in the field. However, major hurdles remain including incompleteness of high-quality experimental data, lack of in vitro and in vivo assays to characterize multi-targeting agents, shortage of robust computational methods, and challenges to identify the best target combinations and design effective multi-targeting agents. Fortunately, numerous national/international efforts including multi-omics and artificial intelligence initiatives as well as most recent collaborations on addressing the COVID-19 pandemic have shown significant promise to propel the field of polypharmacology forward.","Chaudhari, Rajan; Fong, Long Wolf; Tan, Zhi; Huang, Beibei; Zhang, Shuxing",Expert Opin Drug Discov,279,26

While extensive research has been conducted on the optimization of the video streaming pipeline, in particular the development of novel video codecs, further improvement in the video quality and latency is required, especially under poor network conditions. This paper proposes an alternative to the conventional codec through the implementation of a keypoint-centric encoder relying on the transmission of keypoint information from within a video feed. The decoder uses the streamed keypoints to generate a reconstruction preserving the semantic features in the input feed. Focusing on video calling applications, we detect and transmit the body pose and face mesh information through the network, which are displayed at the receiver in the form of animated puppets. Using efficient pose and face mesh detection in conjunction with skeleton-based animation, we demonstrate a prototype requiring lower than 35 kbps bandwidth, an order of magnitude reduction over typical video calling systems. The added computational latency due to the mesh extraction and animation is below 120ms on a standard laptop, showcasing the potential of this framework for real-time applications.

The limited supply of real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) kits and reagents has made meeting the rising demand for increased testing incompetent, worldwide. A highly sensitive and specific antigen-based rapid diagnostic test (RDT) is the need of the hour. The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of a rapid chromatographic immunoassay-based test (index test) compared with a clinical reference standard (rRT-PCR). Methods: : A cross-sectional, single-blinded study was conducted at a tertiary care teaching hospital in north India. Paired samples were taken for RDT and rRT-PCR (reference standard) from consecutive participants screened for COVID-19 to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of the RDT. Further subgroup analysis was done based on the duration of illness and cycle threshold values. Cohen's kappa coefficient was used to measure the level of agreement between the two tests. Results: : Of the 330 participants, 77 were rRT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2. Sixty four of these patients also tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RDT. The overall sensitivity and specificity were 81.8 and 99.6 per cent, respectively. The sensitivity of RDT was higher (85.9%) in participants with a duration of illness &#8804;5 days. Interpretation & conclusions: : With an excellent specificity and moderate sensitivity, this RDT may be used to rule in COVID-19 in patients with a duration of illness &#8804;5 days. Large-scale testing based on this RDT across the country would result in quick detection, isolation and treatment of COVID-19 patients.","Gupta, Ankesh; Khurana, Surbhi; Das, Rojaleen; Srigyan, Deepankar; Singh, Amit; Mittal, Ankit; Singh, Parul; Soneja, Manish; Kumar, Arvind; Singh, Akhil Kant; Soni, Kapil Dev; Meena, Suneeta; Aggarwal, Richa; Sharad, Neha; Aggarwal, Anivita; Kadnur, Harshith; George, Netto; Singh, Komal; Desai, Devashish; Trilangi, Praveen; Khan, Adil Rashid; Kiro, Vandana V; Naik, Shivdas; Arunan, Bharthi; Goel, Shivam; Patidar, Diksha; Lathwal, Amit; Dar, Lalit; Trikha, Anjan; Pandey, Ravindra Mohan; Malhotra, Rajesh; Guleria, Randeep; Mathur, Purva; Wig, Naveet",Indian journal of medical research,279,30

Normally, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) protects the vascular endothelium from damage from oxidized phospholipids, which accumulate under conditions of oxidative stress. The current work evaluated the antioxidant function of HDL in IIM patients. METHODS: HDL's antioxidant function was measured in IIM patients using a cell-free assay, which assesses the ability of isolated patient HDL to inhibit oxidation of low-density lipoproteins and is reported as the HDL inflammatory index (HII). Cholesterol profiles were measured for all patients, and subgroup analysis included assessment of oxidized fatty acids in HDL and plasma MPO activity. A subgroup of IIM patients was compared with healthy controls. RESULTS: The antioxidant function of HDL was significantly worse in patients with IIM (n = 95) compared with healthy controls (n = 41) [mean (s.d.) HII 1.12 (0.61) vs 0.82 (0.13), P < 0.0001]. Higher HII associated with higher plasma MPO activity [mean (s.d.) 13.2 (9.1) vs 9.1 (4.6), P = 0.0006] and higher oxidized fatty acids in HDL. Higher 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid in HDL correlated with worse diffusion capacity in patients with interstitial lung disease (r = -0.58, P = 0.02), and HDL's antioxidant function was most impaired in patients with autoantibodies against melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) or anti-synthetase antibodies. In multivariate analysis including 182 IIM patients, higher HII was associated with higher disease activity and DM diagnosis. CONCLUSION: The antioxidant function of HDL is abnormal in IIM patients and may warrant further investigation for its role in propagating microvascular inflammation and damage in this patient population.","Bae, Sangmae Sharon; Lee, Yuen Yin; Shahbazian, Ani; Wang, Jennifer; Meriwether, David; Golub, Ilana; Oganesian, Buzand; Dowd, Tyler; Reddy, Srinivasa T; Charles-Schoeman, Christina",Rheumatology (Oxford),279,1

Many societies issued guidelines to suspend or postpone nonemergent surgeries. Methods: We reviewed the emerging evidence regarding the impact of COVID-19 infection in neurosurgery and the postponement of elective surgeries. Results and Observations: COVID-19 infection poses serious threat in hospitals in the form of cross-infection, hospital staff falling sick, with potential risk to overwhelm or paralyze the healthcare. In addition, we have come to realize the significant perioperative morbidity and mortality secondary to active COVID-19 infection. All these strongly favor suspension of elective neurosurgical services. However, these have to be weighed against the fallout due to prolonged postponement of neurosurgical treatment for conditions, which can progress and cause neurological deterioration. Conclusion: This article discusses the contemporary published literature regarding the perioperative risk of COVID-19 infection, impact of postponed surgeries, challenges, risk assessment and guidelines for elective neurosurgery at this point of time.","Arimappamagan, Arivazhagan; Vilanilam, George; Pandey, Paritosh",Neurol India,279,1

Patients with multiple sclerosis (MS)-an autoimmune demyelinating inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS)-are predominantly treated with immunomodulatory/immunosuppressive disease-modifying therapies (DMTs), which can increase the risk of infection. Therefore, there is concern that these patients may have a higher risk of COVID-19. In response to growing concerns of neurologists and patients, this study aimed to determine the prevalence, severity, and possible complications of COVID-19 infection in patients with MS in Saudi Arabia (SA). METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, demographic and clinical data were obtained from patients residing in SA with MS who had a positive result for COVID-19 per reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test or viral gene sequencing, using respiratory or plasma samples. Comparison of COVID-19 severity groups was performed using one-way ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test for numerical variables and Chi-squared test for categorical variables. RESULTS: Seventy patients with MS and COVID-19 (71% female) were included in this analysis. Of the 53 (75.7%) patients receiving a DMT at the time of COVID-19 infection, the most frequently used DMTs were fingolimod (25%) and interferon-beta (25%). Nine (13%) patients had MS relapse and were treated with intravenous methylprednisolone in the four weeks before COVID-19 infection. The most common symptoms at the peak of COVID-19 infection were fever (46%), fatigue (37%), and headache (36%). Symptoms lasted for a mean duration of 8.7 days; all symptomatic patients recovered and no deaths were reported. COVID-19 severity was categorized in three groups: asymptomatic (n = 12), mild-not requiring hospitalization (n = 48), and requiring hospitalization (n = 10; two of whom were admitted to the intensive care unit [ICU]). Between the three groups, comparison of age, body mass index , Expanded Disability Severity Score , MS disease duration, and DMT use at the time of infection showed no significant differences. A higher percentage of patients who were admitted to hospital or the ICU (40%; p = 0.026) presented with an MS relapse within the prior four weeks compared with those who were asymptomatic or had a mild infection (both 8.3%). CONCLUSION: These findings present a reassuring picture regarding COVID-19 infection in patients with MS. However, patients with MS who have had a relapse in the preceding four weeks (requiring glucocorticoid treatment) may have an increased risk of severe COVID-19.","Alshamrani, Foziah; Alnajashi, Hind; AlJumah, Mohammed; Almuaigel, Mohammad; Almalik, Yaser; Makkawi, Seraj; Alsalman, Sadiq; Almejally, Mousa; Qureshi, Shireen; Aljarallah, Salman; AlKhawajah, Nuha; Kedah, Hanaa; Alotaibi, Hessa; Saeedi, Jameelah; Alamri, Abdulla",Mult Scler Relat Disord,279,16

Results The percentage of SLPs completing the most endoscopic procedures prepandemic (&#8805; 10/week) was reduced from 39% of respondents to 3% due to the pandemic. Those who completed the most tracheoesophageal puncture voice prosthesis changes (&#8805; 5/week) reported a reduction in frequency from 24% to 6%. Twenty-five percent of SLPs reported that they were tested for COVID-19, and 6% reported a positive result. Descriptive statistics suggest that COVID-19 testing rates of SLPs, the percentage of SLPs experiencing a financial impact, and the percentage who were furloughed varied across SLP work setting. Conclusions These findings provide the first data characterizing the impact on COVID-19 on clinical practice for SLPs engaged in procedures such as endoscopy and laryngectomy care. The results indicate that, as frontline workers, SLPs were directly impacted in their practice patterns, personal health, safety, and financial security, and that these reported impacts occurred differently across SLP work settings.","Kearney, Ann; Searl, Jeff; Erickson-DiRenzo, Elizabeth; Doyle, Philip C",Am J Speech Lang Pathol,279,24

OBJECTIVE: We have screened phytocompounds from a medicinal herb, Tinospora cordifolia, for their capacities to interrupt the viral RBD and host ACE2 interactions. METHOD: We employed molecular docking to screen phytocompounds in T. cordifolia against the ACE2-RBD complex, performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, and estimated the electrostatic component of binding free energy. RESULTS: 'Tinocordiside' docked very well at the center of the interface of ACE2-RBD complex, and was found to be well stabilized during MD simulation. Tinocordiside incorporation significantly decreased electrostatic component of binding free energies of ACE2-RBD complex (23.5 and 17.10 kcal/mol in the trajectories without or with the ligand, respectively). As the basal rate constant of protein association is in the order of 5, (105 to 106 M-1 S-1 ), there might be no big conformational change or loop reorganization, but involves only local conformational change typically observed in diffusion-controlled association. Taken together, the increase in global flexibility of the complex, clearly indicates the start of unbinding process of the complex. CONCLUSION: It indicates that such an interruption of electrostatic interactions between the RBD and ACE2, and the increase in global flexibility of the complex, would weaken or block SARS-CoV-2 entry and its subsequent infectivity. We postulate that natural phytochemicals like Tinocordiside could be the viable options for controlling SARS-CoV-2 contagion and its entry into host cells.","Balkrishna, Acharya; Pokhrel, Subarna; Varshney, Anurag",Combinatorial chemistry &amp; high throughput screening (Online),279,16

Several countries have reported a steep rise in hate crimes infuriated by malicious hate campaigns. While the detection of hate speech is one of the emerging research areas, the generation and spread of topic-dependent hate in the information network remain under-explored. In this work, we focus on exploring user behaviour, which triggers the genesis of hate speech on Twitter and how it diffuses via retweets. We crawl a large-scale dataset of tweets, retweets, user activity history, and follower networks, comprising over 161 million tweets from more than $41$ million unique users. We also collect over 600k contemporary news articles published online. We characterize different signals of information that govern these dynamics. Our analyses differentiate the diffusion dynamics in the presence of hate from usual information diffusion. This motivates us to formulate the modelling problem in a topic-aware setting with real-world knowledge. For predicting the initiation of hate speech for any given hashtag, we propose multiple feature-rich models, with the best performing one achieving a macro F1 score of 0.65. Meanwhile, to predict the retweet dynamics on Twitter, we propose RETINA, a novel neural architecture that incorporates exogenous influence using scaled dot-product attention. RETINA achieves a macro F1-score of 0.85, outperforming multiple state-of-the-art models. Our analysis reveals the superlative power of RETINA to predict the retweet dynamics of hateful content compared to the existing diffusion models.","Masud, Sarah; Dutta, Subhabrata; Makkar, Sakshi; Jain, Chhavi; Goyal, Vikram; Das, Amitava; Chakraborty, Tanmoy",,279,22

In all 16 counties, an increase in reported COVID-19 case incidence was observed in all three age groups soon after the governor-ordered Full Phase 1 reopening went into effect. Trends in social mobility, but not trends in testing, track case incidence. Data on hospitalization do not support the hypothesis that the observed increase in case incidence was merely the result of liberalization of testing criteria. Parameter estimates from a parsimonious two-group heterogeneous SIR model strongly support the hypothesis that younger persons, having first acquired their infections through increasing social contact with their peers, then transmitted their infections to older, less socially mobile individuals. Without such cross-infection, an isolated epidemic among older people in Florida would be unsustainable.","Harris, Jeffrey E",Rev Econ Househ,279,24

This article presents a novel modeling approach, capable to self-deploy both the system structure and the activities for goal-driven agents that can take appropriate actions to achieve their goals. Humans, robots, and animals are all endowed with this type of behavior. Self-organization is shown to emerge from the decisions of a common rational activity algorithm, based on the information of a system-specific goals dependency network. The unique self-deployment feature of this approach, that can also be applied to non-goal-driven agents, can boost considerably the range and depth of application of agent-based modeling.","Jaraiz, Martin",,279,6

This study measures the public support for policies designed to increase housing stability and gauges whether support levels are associated with views about the role of evictions in COVID-19 transmission and the existence of racial inequities in the housing market. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey with a representative sample of U.S. adults in November 2020 assessed support for 4 housing policies. Logistic regression models estimated the adjusted levels of support for each policy, with separate models testing the association with whether or not a respondent recognized the role of evictions in increased COVID-19 transmission or acknowledged racial inequities in the housing market. RESULTS: Most U.S. adults supported policies aimed to increase housing stability during the COVID-19 pandemic, including extending moratoriums on evictions (63%) and foreclosures (67%) and increasing emergency rental assistance (63%). In total, 54% supported increased government spending on housing vouchers. Adults who agreed that averting eviction would slow COVID-19 transmission had higher support for housing stability policies, as did those who agreed that it was easier for White families to find affordable, high-quality housing than Black families. CONCLUSIONS: Support for housing stability policies was strong among U.S. adults, particularly among those who agreed that preventing evictions slowed COVID-19 transmission and among those who acknowledged racial inequities in the housing market. Raising public awareness of the connections among unstable housing, infectious disease transmission, and racial inequity could broaden the support for policies to keep people in their homes through the pandemic.","Pollack, Craig Evan; Leifheit, Kathryn M; McGinty, Emma E; Levine, Adam S; Barry, Colleen L; Linton, Sabriya L",Am. j. prev. med,279,1

We aimed to clarify how soon SARS-CoV-2 transmission can occur after infection by asymptomatically infected individuals. METHODS: We analyzed the publicly available epidemiological information for a cluster of 108 cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in Osaka, Japan. RESULTS: Among cases, 51 cases attended a live music club only once and were considered to have a single visit. Ten remained asymptomatic at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, which was on average 20 days after exposure. Three routes of secondary transmission were identified, with 2-4 days from infection to transmission. All index cases for secondary transmission were asymptomatic at the time of contact with other people. Based on the date of symptom onset in the remaining 41 cases, the period from exposure to illness ranged from 2 to 17 days. CONCLUSIONS: Seemingly healthy people could spread SARS-CoV-2 during intense activities in enclosed environments without sufficient ventilation.

What factors caused the rapid early pandemic of the COVID-19 in developed countries is the main goal of this study. We collected the main disease indicators and various environmental and economic factors in 61 countries around the world. Our results show that the number of cases is positively correlated with the country's GDP. We further analyzed the factors related to the spread of the disease. They indicate a strong positive correlation between the total patient numbers and the number of airline passengers, with an r value of 0.80. There is also a positive correlation between the number of car ownership and the total patient, with an r value of 0.35. Both the flight passengers and car ownership contribute 66% to the number of total patients. The total death numbers and the number of airline passengers are positively correlated, with an r value of 0.71. A positive correlation between the number of car ownership and the total deaths is with an r value of 0.42. The total contribution of both the flight passengers and car ownership to the number of total deaths is 57%. Our conclusion is that the main cause of the coronavirus pandemic in developed countries is related to the transportation. In other words, the number of travelers determined the early coronavirus pandemic. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen restrictions and screening of passengers at airports, especially international airports.","Ma, Li; Yu, Zhuo; Jiao, Yan; Lin, Lin; Zhong, Wei; Day, Sara W; Postlethwaite, Arnold; Chen, Hong; Li, Qiang; Yin, Heliang; Wang, Gang",Environ. sci. pollut. res. int.

The aim of this study was to explore the effect of the pandemic on the largest molecular diagnostics center for cancer patients and high-risk individuals in Serbia. Research design and methods: EGFR, KRAS/NRAS, BRAF and BRCA1/2 mutation testing were performed by qPCR and NGS. NGS was used for panel testing of hereditary breast/ovarian cancer and cancers associated with Lynch syndrome. The analytical output during the state of emergency (SoE) was compared to the period before and after the outbreak using one-way ANOVA. Statistical significance was set at p<0.05. Results: A 38% reduction in the number of analysis was detected during the SoE. After the SoE, a 19% reduction was noted compared to SoE and 50% compared to the period before the SoE (p=0.038). Only 3 of the 48 scheduled appointments for pre-test genetic counseling were carried out during the SoE, but the number of NGS tests increased by 50%.

This study analyzed obesity as an independent risk factor for mortality in hospitalized patients younger than 50. METHODS: This study retrospectively analyzed data of patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized to a large academic hospital system in New York City between March 1, 2020, and May 17, 2020. Data included demographics, comorbidities, BMI, and smoking status. Obesity groups included the following: BMI of 30 to < 40 kg/m2 and BMI &#8805; 40 kg/m2 . Multivariable logistic regression models identified variables independently associated with mortality in patients younger and older than 50. RESULTS: Overall, 3,406 patients were included; 572 (17.0%) patients were younger than 50. In the younger age group, 60 (10.5%) patients died. In the older age group, 1,076 (38.0%) patients died. For the younger population, BMI &#8805; 40 was independently associated with mortality (adjusted odds ratio 5.1; 95% CI: 2.3-11.1). For the older population, BMI &#8805; 40 was also independently associated with mortality to a lesser extent (adjusted odds ratio 1.6; 95% CI: 1.2-2.3). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that hospitalized patients younger than 50 with severe obesity are more likely to die of COVID-19.

Addressing such a gap is timely as HWs are pivotal resources, particularly during pandemics or the ensuing recessions. Drawing from the empirical literature, we aimed to provide a framework for understanding the impact of recessions on HWs and their reactions. We use a systematic review and best-fit framework synthesis approach to identify the relevant qualitative, quantitative and mixed-methods evidence, and refine an a priori, theory-based conceptual framework. Eight relevant databases were searched, and four reviewers employed to independently review full texts, extract data and appraise the quality of the evidence retrieved. A total of 57 peer-reviewed publications were included, referring to six economic recessions. The 2010-15 Great Recession in Europe was the subject of most (52%) of the papers. Our consolidated framework suggests that recessions transmit to HWs through three channels: (1) an increase in the demand for services; (2) the impacts of austerity measures; and (3) changes in the health labour market. Some of the evidence appeared specific to the context of crises; demand for health services and employment increased during economic recessions in North America and Oceania, but stagnated or declined in Europe in connection with the austerity measures adopted. Burn-out, lay-offs, migration and multiple jobholding were the reactions observed in Europe, but job opportunities never dwindled for physicians during recessions in North America, with nurses re-entering labour markets during such crises. Loss of motivation, absenteeism and abuse of health systems were documented during recessions in low-income countries. Although the impacts of recessions may vary across economic events, health systems, labour markets and policy responses, our review and framework provide an evidence base for policies to mitigate the effects on HWs.","Russo, Giuliano; Silva, Tiago Jesus; Gassasse, Zakariah; Filippon, Jonathan; Rotulo, Arianna; Kondilis, Elias",Health policy plan,279,29

Because of its extremely fast spreading, the attention of the global scientific community is now focusing on slowing down, containing and finally stopping the spread of this disease. This requires the concerted action of researchers and practitioners of many related fields, raising, as always in such situations the question, of what kind of research has to be conducted, what are the priorities, how has research to be coordinated and who needs to be involved. In other words, what are the characteristics of the response of the global research community on the challenge? In the present paper, we attempt to characterise, quantify and measure the response of academia to international public health emergencies in a comparative bibliometric study of multiple outbreaks. In addition, we provide a preliminary review of the global research effort regarding the defeat of the COVID-19 pandemic. From our analysis of six infectious disease outbreaks since 2000, including COVID-19, we find that academia always responded quickly to public health emergencies with a sharp increase in the number of publications immediately following the declaration of an outbreak by the WHO. In general, countries/regions place emphasis on epidemics in their own region, but Europe and North America are also concerned with outbreaks in other, developed and less developed areas through conducting intensive collaborative research with the core countries/regions of the outbreak, such as in the case of Ebola in Africa. Researches in the fields of virology, infectious diseases and immunology are the most active, and we identified two characteristic patterns in global science distinguishing research in Europe and America that is more focused on public health from that conducted in China and Japan with more emphasis on biomedical research and clinical pharmacy, respectively. Universities contribute slightly less than half to the global research output, and the vast majority of research funding originates from the public sector. Our findings on how academia responds to emergencies could be beneficial to decision-makers in research and health policy in creating and adjusting anti-epidemic/-pandemic strategies.","Zhang, Lin; Zhao, Wenjing; Sun, Beibei; Huang, Ying; Glänzel, Wolfgang",Scientometrics,279,7

With no proven vaccination or treatment, infection control measures are paramount. In this article, we aim to describe the impact of COVID-19 on our practice and share our strategies and guidelines to maintain a sustainable ophthalmology practice. METHODS: Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) Eye Centre is the only ophthalmology department supporting the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), which is the national screening center and the main center for management of COVID-19 patients in Singapore. Our guidelines during this outbreak are discussed. RESULTS: Challenges in different care settings in our ophthalmology practice have been identified and analyzed with practical solutions and guidelines implemented in anticipation of these challenges. First, to minimize cross-infection of COVID-19, stringent infection control measures were set up. These include personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare workers and routine cleaning of ""high-touch"" surfaces. Second, for outpatient care, a stringent dual screening and triaging process were carried out to identify high-risk patients, with proper isolation for such patients. Administrative measures to lower patient attendance and reschedule appointments were carried out. Third, inpatient and outpatient care were separated to minimize interactions. Last but not least, logistics and manpower plans were drawn up in anticipation of resource demands and measures to improve the mental well-being of staff were implemented. CONCLUSION: We hope our measures during this COVID-19 pandemic can help ophthalmologists globally and serve to guide and maintain safe access in ophthalmology clinics when faced with similar disease outbreaks.","Lim, Louis W; Yip, Leonard W; Tay, Hui Wen; Ang, Xue Ling; Lee, Llewellyn K; Chin, Chee Fang; Yong, Vernon",Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol,279,33

The present study was conducted to evaluate the diagnostic potential of phenotypic methods for carbapenemase [carbapenem-hydrolyzing class D ß-lactamases (CHDLs) and metallo-ß-lactamases (MBLs)] production, by comparing with molecular detection of genes. Methods: One hundred and fifty clinical CRAB isolates collected between August 2013 and January 2014 were studied. Multiplex PCR was performed to identify the carbapenemases produced (class D blaOXA-51, blaOXA-23, blaOXA-48, blaOXA-58; class B blaVIM, blaNDM-1, blaIMP; class A blaKPC). Each isolate was evaluated for carbapenemase production by studying the pattern of imipenem hydrolysis using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Results: The most commonly encountered carbapenemase genes were blaOXA-51(100%), blaOXA-23(98%), blaVIM(49.3%), blaNDM-1(18.7%) and blaOXA-58(2%). MALDI-TOF MS was able to detect 30.6 per cent carbapenemases within three hours (P=0.001 for MBL and P>0.05 for CHDL) and 65.3 per cent within six hours (P=0.001 for MBL and P>0.05 for CHDL). Interpretation & conclusions: MALDI-TOF MS reliably detected carbapenemase activity within a short span of time, thus helping in tailoring patient therapy. MALDI-TOF MS, once optimized, can prove to be a useful tool for timely detection of carbapenemase production by A. baumannii and consequently in directing appropriate antimicrobial therapy.","Sharma, Megha; Singhal, Lipika; Gautam, Vikas; Ray, Pallab",Indian J Med Res,279,3

Patients undergoing chemotherapy treatment (e.g., bleomycin, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, monoclonal antibodies, and paclitaxel therapy) are vulnerable to the development of respiratory syndromes induced by chemotherapeutic agents and are also more susceptible to viral infections as they are immunosuppressed. Neutropenia is an important risk factor for increased vulnerability to infections, as a respiratory syndrome involves an array of immune cells maintaining the balance between pathogen clearance and immunopathology. However, the differential diagnosis of pulmonary symptoms in cancer patients is broad, with complications being related to the malignancy itself, treatment toxicity, and infections. The risk factors depend on the specific type of cancer, chemotherapy, patient characteristics, and comorbidities. Thus, this review discusses the main events implicated in immunosuppression caused by chemotherapy and radiation therapy and the association of immunosuppression and other factors with SARS-CoV-2 infection susceptibility in cancer patients; and, importantly, how to deal with this situation in face of the current pandemic scenario.","Corso, Claudia Rita; Mulinari Turin de Oliveira, Natalia; Maria-Ferreira, Daniele",J Infect Public Health,279,16

RESULTS: Percentages of deaths by COVID-19 in Nursing homes, between 40% and 88%, of the total of (p < 0.001, X2 = 0.975). A relationship is established between the number of deaths from COVID-19 in Nursing homes, and the higher number of private Nursing homes (p < 0.001, X2 = 0.633). The larger the size of the Nursing home, the more deaths by COVID-19 were recorded (p < 0.001, X2 = 0.787), with private Nursing homes having +100 places, and public Nursing homes having +100 places (p < 0.001, X2 = 0.808). CONCLUSIONS: It was found that there is a relationship between the number of deaths from COVID-19 in Nursing homes, and the fact that there are a greater number of private Nursing homes in that autonomous community. It was detected that the model of Nursing home best prepared to face the COVID-19: public Nursing homes with less than 25 places.","Barrera-Algarín, Evaristo; Estepa-Maestre, Francisco; Sarasola-Sánchez-Serrano, José Luís; Malagón-Siria, José Carlos",Rev. esp. geriatr. gerontol.

Compared to bacterial studies, laboratory and analytical methods to study the entirety of viral communities in clinical samples are rudimentary and need further refinement. In order to address this need, we developed Virobiome-Seq, a sequence capture method and an accompanying bioinformatics analysis pipeline, that identifies viral reads in human samples. Virobiome-Seq is able to enrich for and detect multiple types of viruses in human samples, including novel subtypes that diverge at the sequence level. In addition, Virobiome-Seq is able to detect RNA transcripts from DNA viruses and may provide a sensitive method for detecting viral activity in vivo. Since Virobiome-Seq also yields the viral sequence, it makes it possible to investigate associations between viral genotype and psychiatric illness. In this proof of concept study, we detected HIV1, Torque Teno, Pegi, Herpes and Papilloma virus sequences in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells, plasma and stool samples collected from individuals with psychiatric disorders. We also detected the presence of numerous novel circular RNA viruses but were unable to determine whether these viruses originate from the sample or represent contaminants. Despite this challenge, we demonstrate that our knowledge of viral diversity is incomplete and opportunities for novel virus discovery exist. Virobiome-Seq will enable a more sophisticated analysis of the virome and has the potential of uncovering complex interactions between viral activity and psychiatric disease.","Yolken, Robert H; Kinnunen, Paula M; Vapalahti, Olli; Dickerson, Faith; Suvisaari, Jaana; Chen, Ou; Sabunciyan, Sarven",Schizophr. res,279,3

A systematic search using PubMed/Medline and Scopus databases and preprint servers was performed. The articles were classified according to their type, subject and country of origin. Up to 31 March 2020, a total of 2062 papers published in 578 peer-reviewed journals and 1425 preprints posted mostly on medRxiv (55.4 %), were identified. The mean number of published journal papers and preprints per day in the considered period was 27 and 12, respectively, and reached a maximum of 51 and 46 per day in March, respectively. The identified articles, journal papers and preprints, mostly covered the epidemiology of COVID-19 (35.7 %), clinical aspects of infection (21.0 %), preventative measures (12.8 %), treatment options (12.5 %), diagnostics (12.2 %), mathematical modeling of disease transmission and mitigation (9.6 %), and molecular biology and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 (8.7 %). The majority of the journal papers were commentaries (38.5 %), reviews (33.6 %) and original research (21.3 %), while preprints predominantly presented original results (89.8 %). Chinese scientists contributed the highest share of original research and were responsible for 32.9 % journal papers and 43.9 % preprints published in the considered period. A high number of contributions was also seen from the United States, the United Kingdom, and Italy. The benefits and potential risks of such a massive publication output are discussed. The scientific response seen during the first 3 months of the COVID-19 outbreak is a demonstration of the capabilities of modern science to react rapidly to emerging global health threats by providing and discussing the essential information for understanding the etiological factor, its spread, preventative measures, and mitigation strategies.","Nowakowska, Joanna; Sobocinska, Joanna; Lewicki, Mateusz; Lemanska, Zaneta; Rzymski, Piotr",Biomed Pharmacother,279,1

The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the risk of death, bringing unbearable psychological pressure upon people worldwide. For celiac patients, the pandemic may represent an additional burden concerning the inherent aspects of celiac disease (CD) that compromise these individuals' quality of life (QoL). Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate Brazilian celiac patients' QoL during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic caused by its outbreak and rapid spread and subsequent restrictive measures in addition to the dietary restrictions and other burdens caused by CD. This country-wide cross-sectional study was conducted using a self-administered instrument previously validated in Brazilian-Portuguese to investigate the QoL of individuals with CD. Data collected through the online self-administration of the Brazilian version of the celiac disease quality of life questionnaire (CDQ) comprised 674 CD individuals' responses. Although pandemics have historically posed a challenge for Brazilian population, this period was not associated with a negative impact on Brazilian CD individuals' QoL. During the pandemic, the QoL of Brazilian's with CD was more affected by gastrointestinal aspects than emotions and social aspects and worries. Gender, age, marital status, having (or not) children, occupation, and a positive test for COVID-19 did not affect CD individuals' QoL. However, the study revealed a larger burden and diminished QoL for individuals not following a gluten-free diet and those using antidepressants. Additional research is necessary to verify how the length of the pandemic will affect celiac individuals and then compare those outcomes compare to the COVID-19 period and after.","Falcomer, Ana Luísa; Farage, Priscila; Pratesi, Cláudia B; Pratesi, Riccardo; Gandolfi, Lenora; Nakano, Eduardo Yoshio; Raposo, António; Zandonadi, Renata Puppin",Nutrients,279,16

Therefore, in order to select suitable donors, neutralizing antibody titer against SARS CoV-2 needs to be determined. Because the neutralization assay is highly demanding from several points of view, a pre-selection of sera would be desirable to minimize the number of sera to be tested. In this study, a total of 140 serum samples that had been titrated for SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody by microneutralization assay were also tested for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV2 antibody using 5 different tests: Architect® immunoassay (Abbott Diagnostics), detecting IgG against the nucleocapsid protein, LIAISON XL® (Diasorin) detecting IgG against a recombinant form of the S1/S2 subunits of the spike protein, VITROS® (Ortho Clinical Diagnostics), detecting IgG against a recombinant form of the spike protein, and ELISA (Euroimmun AG), detecting IgA or IgG against a recombinant form of the S1 subunit. To determine which immunoassay had the highest chance to detect sera with neutralizing antibodies above a certain threshold, we compared the results obtained from the five immunoassays with the titers obtained by microneutralization assay by linear regression analysis and by using receiver operating characteristic curve and Youden's index. Our results indicate that the most suitable method to predict sera with high Nab titer is Euroimmun® IgG, followed closely by Ortho VITROS® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG.","Moscato, Giovanna Mazzetti Paola Lucenteforte Ersilia Rosellini Alfredo Cara Alice Quaranta Paola Mainardi Valerio Villa Pietro Focosi Daniele Lanza Maria Bianco Irene Mazzoni Alessandro Falcone Marco Menichetti Francesco Maggi Fabrizio Lai Michele Freer Giulia Pistello Mauro",Journal of Clinical Virology Plus,279,1

Emerging evidence suggests that the composition of the gut microbiome and modification of microbial ecology via probiotics can affect susceptibility to a wide range of infections, including respiratory tract infections. In this study, we aim to evaluate the effects of the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) versus placebo on COVID-19 infection status and the gut microbiome in subjects with a household contact who has tested positive for COVID-19. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In this double-blinded, randomised, placebo-controlled trial, we will randomise 1132 subjects having a household contact who has recently (&#8804;7 days) tested positive for COVID-19 to daily oral LGG or placebo for 28 days. We hypothesise that taking LGG as a probiotic will protect against COVID-19 infection and reduce the severity of disease in those who become infected (primary endpoint: decreased symptoms), and will be associated with beneficial changes in the composition of the gut microbiome. Stool samples and nasal swabs will be collected to evaluate the microbiome by 16S rRNA sequencing and the presence of SARS-CoV-2 by PCR, respectively. We will also conduct multivariate analysis of demographic, behavioural, temporal, and other variables that may predict development of symptoms and other outcomes. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This trial is conducted under a Food and Drug Administration Investigational New Drug for LGG, has received ethics approval by the institutional review board of Duke University and enrolment has begun. We plan to disseminate the results in peer-reviewed journals and at national and international conferences.

METHODS: A 1:2 matched case-control study was performed to evaluate re-hospitalization, lung allograft function, and secondary infections up to 90 days after COVID-19 diagnosis (or index dates for controls). RESULTS: Twenty-four LTRs with COVID-19 (cases) and 48 controls were identified. Cases and controls had similar baseline characteristics and lung allograft function. LTRs with COVID-19 had higher incidence of secondary bacterial infection (29.2% vs 6.3%, p = 0.008), readmission (29.2% vs 10.4%, p = 0.04), and for-cause bronchoscopy (33.3% vs 12.5%, p = 0.04) compared to controls. At day 90, mortality in cases vs controls was 8.3 vs 2.1% (p = 0.21), incidence of invasive fungal infections in cases vs controls was 20.8% vs 8.3% (p = 0.13) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) decline &#8805; 10% from baseline occurred in 19% of cases vs 12.2% of controls (p= 0.46). No acute cellular rejection, acute antibody mediated rejection, or new donor specific anti-HLA antibodies were observed among cases or controls within 90 days post index date. CONCLUSIONS: We found LTRs with COVID-19 were at risk to develop secondary infections and re-hospitalization post COVID-19, compared to controls. While we did not observe post -viral ACR or AMR, further studies are needed to understand if LTRs with COVID-19 who did not recover baseline lung function within 90 days have developed chronic lung allograft dysfunction stage progression.","Permpalung, Nitipong; Bazemore, Katrina; Chiang, Teresa Po-Yu; Mathew, Joby; Barker, Lindsay; Nematollahi, Saman; Cochran, Willa; Sait, Afrah S; Avery, Robin K; Shah, Pali D",Transplantation,279,1

To date, there is no specific therapy for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Flavonoids, especially rutin, have attracted considerable interest as a prospective SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) inhibitor. In this study, a database containing 2017 flavone analogs was prepared and screened against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro using the molecular docking technique. According to the results, 371 flavone analogs exhibited good potency towards Mpro with docking scores less than -9.0 kcal/mol. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, followed by molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) binding energy calculations, were performed for the top potent analogs in complex with Mpro. Compared to rutin, PubChem-129-716-607 and PubChem-885-071-27 showed better binding affinities against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro over 150 ns MD course with &#916;Gbinding values of -69.0 and -68.1 kcal/mol, respectively. Structural and energetic analyses demonstrated high stability of the identified analogs inside the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro active site over 150 ns MD simulations. The oral bioavailabilities of probable SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors were underpinned using drug-likeness parameters. A comparison of the binding affinities demonstrated that the MM/GBSA binding energies of the identified flavone analogs were approximately three and two times less than those of lopinavir and baicalein, respectively. In conclusion, PubChem-129-716-607 and PubChem-885-071-27 are promising anti-COVID-19 drug candidates that warrant further clinical investigations.","Ibrahim, Mahmoud A A; Mohamed, Eslam A R; Abdelrahman, Alaa H M; Allemailem, Khaled S; Moustafa, Mahmoud F; Shawky, Ahmed M; Mahzari, Ali; Hakami, Abdulrahim Refdan; Abdeljawaad, Khlood A A; Atia, Mohamed A M",J Mol Graph Model,279,17

In the absence of a common approach to ensure access to this essential health service, we sought to describe the variability of abortion policies during the outbreak in Europe in order to identify strategies that improve availability and access to abortion in times of public health crises. METHODS: We collected information from 46 countries/regions: 31 for which country-experts completed a survey and 15 for which we conducted a desk review. We describe abortion regulations and changes to regulations and practice during the pandemic. RESULTS: During COVID-19, abortions were banned in six countries and suspended in one. Surgical abortion was less available due to COVID-19 in 12 countries/regions and services were not available or delayed for women with COVID-19 symptoms in eleven. No country expanded its gestational limit for abortion. Changes during COVID-19, mostly designed to reduce in-person consultations, occurred in 13 countries/regions. Altogether eight countries/regions provided home medical abortion with mifepristone and misoprostol beyond 9 weeks (from 9 weeks+6 days to 11 weeks+6 days) and 13 countries/regions up to 9 weeks (in some instances only misoprostol could be taken at home). Only six countries/regions offered abortion by telemedicine. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of a unified policy response to COVID-19 restrictions has widened inequities in abortion access in Europe, but some innovations including telemedicine deployed during the outbreak could serve as a catalyst to ensure continuity and equity of abortion care.","Moreau, Caroline; Shankar, Mridula; Glasier, Anna; Cameron, Sharon; Gemzell-Danielsson, Kristina",BMJ sex. reprod. health (Online),279,20

The resulting severe, pandemic-related circumstances have disrupted physical and face-to-face contact teaching practices, thereby requiring many students to actively use mobile technologies for learning. Mobile learning technologies offer viable web-based teaching and learning platforms that are accessible to teachers and learners worldwide. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the use of mobile learning platforms for instruction purposes in United Arab Emirates higher education institutions. METHODS: An extended technology acceptance model and theory of planned behavior model were proposed to analyze university students' adoption of mobile learning platforms for accessing course materials, searching the web for information related to their disciplines, sharing knowledge, and submitting assignments during the COVID-19 pandemic. We collected a total of 1880 questionnaires from different universities in the United Arab Emirates. Partial least squares-structural equation modeling and machine learning algorithms were used to assess the research model, which was based on the data gathered from a student survey. RESULTS: Based on our results, each hypothesized relationship within the research model was supported by our data analysis results. It should also be noted that the J48 classifier (89.37% accuracy) typically performed better than the other classifiers when it came to the prediction of the dependent variable. CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed that teaching and learning could considerably benefit from adopting remote learning systems as educational tools during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the value of such systems could be lessened because of the emotions that students experience, including a fear of poor grades, stress resulting from family circumstances, and sadness resulting from a loss of friends. Accordingly, these issues can only be resolved by evaluating the emotions of students during the pandemic.","Akour, Iman; Alshurideh, Muhammad; Al Kurdi, Barween; Al Ali, Amel; Salloum, Said",JMIR Med Educ,279,15

Therefore, measuring and analyzing online health communication and public sentiment is essential for establishing effective and efficient disease control policies, especially in the early stage of an outbreak. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the trends of online health communication, analyze the focus of people's anxiety in the early stages of COVID-19, and evaluate the appropriateness of online information. METHODS: We collected 13,148 questions and 29,040 answers related to COVID-19 from Naver, the most popular Korean web portal (January 20, 2020, to March 2, 2020). Three main methods were used in this study: (1) the structural topic model was used to examine the topics in the online questions; (2) word network analysis was conducted to analyze the focus of people's anxiety and worry in the questions; and (3) two medical doctors assessed the appropriateness of the answers to the questions, which were primarily related to people's anxiety. RESULTS: A total of 50 topics and 6 cohesive topic communities were identified from the questions. Among them, topic community 4 (suspecting COVID-19 infection after developing a particular symptom) accounted for the largest portion of the questions. As the number of confirmed patients increased, the proportion of topics belonging to topic community 4 also increased. Additionally, the prolonged situation led to a slight increase in the proportion of topics related to job issues. People's anxieties and worries were closely related with physical symptoms and self-protection methods. Although relatively appropriate to suspect physical symptoms, a high proportion of answers related to self-protection methods were assessed as misinformation or advertisements. CONCLUSIONS: Search activity for online information regarding the COVID-19 outbreak has been active. Many of the online questions were related to people's anxieties and worries. A considerable portion of corresponding answers had false information or were advertisements. The study results could contribute reference information to various countries that need to monitor public anxiety and provide appropriate information in the early stage of an infectious disease outbreak, including COVID-19. Our research also contributes to developing methods for measuring public opinion and sentiment in an epidemic situation based on natural language data on the internet.","Jo, Wonkwang; Lee, Jaeho; Park, Junli; Kim, Yeol",J Med Internet Res,279,24

The rest of the population will instead have access to a less effective vaccine. Methods: We apply a large-scale agent-based model of COVID-19 in Australia to investigate the possible implications of this hybrid approach to mass-vaccination. The model is calibrated to recent epidemiological and demographic data available in Australia, and accounts for several components of vaccine efficacy. Findings: Within a feasible range of vaccine efficacy values, our model supports the assertion that complete herd immunity due to vaccination is not likely in the Australian context. For realistic scenarios in which herd immunity is not achieved, we simulate the effects of mass-vaccination on epidemic growth rate, and investigate the requirements of lockdown measures applied to curb subsequent outbreaks. In our simulations, Australia's vaccination strategy can feasibly reduce required lockdown intensity and initial epidemic growth rate by 43% and 52%, respectively. The severity of epidemics, as measured by the peak number of daily new cases, decreases by up to two orders of magnitude under plausible mass-vaccination and lockdown strategies. Interpretation: The study presents a strong argument for a large-scale vaccination campaign in Australia, which would substantially reduce both the intensity of future outbreaks and the stringency of non-pharmaceutical interventions required for their suppression.","Zachreson, Cameron; Chang, Sheryl L.; Cliff, Oliver M.; Prokopenko, Mikhail",,279,16

This study aimed to assess the association between the fear and knowledge of black fungus and other determinants among healthcare workers in Bangladesh. MethodsFrom 25th May 2021 to 5th June 2021, a cross-sectional study was carried out among healthcare workers. For data collection during the COVID-19 pandemic, a semi-structured online questionnaire was used followed by convenient and snowball sampling methods. A multivariable linear regression model was fitted to assess the association between the fear and knowledge of black fungus and other determinants. ResultsA total of 422 healthcare workers participated in this study. The results indicated that with the increased knowledge score of black fungus, the average score of black fungus fear was significantly increased ({beta} = 0.35, 95% CI: 0.20, 0.50, p <0.001). Alongside, the respondents having insomnia had a higher score of black fungus fear compare to not having insomnia ({beta} = 3.91, 95% CI: 2.49, 5.33, p <0.001) significantly. The gender, profession, and death due to COVID-19 of friends and family members had a significant effect on black fungus fear score increment. ConclusionEven in the COVID-19 pandemic, the black fungus fear among healthcare workers may hinder their quality of life. Our study findings recommend an emphasis on the mental health aspects and ensure support to the healthcare workers so that they can tackle the ongoing situation with lesser frictions.","Hasan, Md.

However, how and to what extent the daily involvement of trainees in clinical and surgical activities was compromised by the COVID-19 pandemic is currently unknown. Materials and methods: We conducted an electronic survey. An invitation was sent through the executive training administration of the Saudi Commission for Health Specialties (SCFHS) randomly to 400 residents and fellows over two weeks period from April 23, 2020 until May 6, 2020. Descriptive statistics were presented using counts and proportions (%). The comparison between the trainees among the socio-demographic and the characteristics of trainees toward the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on their training had been conducted using the Chi-square test. A p-value cut off point of 0.05 at 95% Confidence Interval (CI) used to determine statistical significance. Results: Out of the 400 questionnaires distributed, 240 trainees responded, resulting in a response rate of 60%. The most frequently cited specialty was surgical (41.3%) and medical (38.3%). Approximately 43% of them had direct contact with patients with COVID-19, and 43.8% had enough training regarding the proper use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).

In male lowlanders, does hypoxia modulate thermoregulatory effector responses during repeated whole-body cold stress encountered in a single day? What is the main finding and its importance? A â¼10 h sustained exposure to hypoxia appears to mediate a gradual upregulation of endogenous heat production, preventing the progressive hypothermic response prompted by serial cold stimuli. Also, hypoxia progressively degrades mood, and compounds the perceived thermal discomfort, and sensations of fatigue and coldness. ABSTRACT: We examined whether hypoxia would modulate thermoeffector responses during repeated cold stress encountered in a single day. Eleven men completed two â¼10 h sessions, while breathing, in normobaria, either normoxia or hypoxia ( P O 2 : 12 kPa). During each session, subjects underwent sequentially three 120 min immersions to the chest in 20°C water (CWI), interspersed by 120 min rewarming. In normoxia, the final drop in rectal temperature (Trec ) was greater in the third (â¼1.2°C) than in the first and second (â¼0.9°C) CWIs (P < 0.05). The first hypoxic CWI augmented the Trec fall (â¼1.2°C; P = 0.002), but the drop in Trec did not vary between the three hypoxic CWIs (P = 0.99). In normoxia, the metabolic heat production ( M Ì ) was greater during the first half of the third CWI than during the corresponding part of the first CWI (P = 0.02); yet the difference was blunted during the second half of the CWIs (P = 0.89). In hypoxia, by contrast, the increase in M Ì was augmented by â¼25% throughout the third CWI (P < 0.01). Regardless of the breathing condition, the cold-induced elevation in mean arterial pressure was blunted in the second and third CWI (P < 0.05). Hypoxia aggravated the sensation of coldness (P = 0.05) and thermal discomfort (P = 0.04) during the second half of the third CWI. The present findings therefore demonstrate that prolonged hypoxia mediates, in a gradual manner, metabolic and thermoperceptual sensitization to repeated cold stress.","Keramidas, Michail E; Kölegård, Roger; Eiken, Ola",Exp. physiol,279,26

A 68-year-old male with a past medical history significant for hypertension and stroke presented to the emergency department with worsening cough and shortness of breath ten days after being diagnosed with Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) infection. He also endorsed fatigue, fever, loss of smell, and diarrhea. He denied any chest pain, nausea and vomiting. On examination, he was febrile with a temperature of 102.2-degree Fahrenheit, heart rate of 145 beats/minute, blood pressure of 120/90 mm of Hg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths/minute, and oxygen saturation of 85% while breathing ambient air. Laboratory data revealed a leukocytosis of 12,000/μL, elevated serum creatinine of 1.38 mg/dL, D-dimer of 4.36 mg/L, C-reactive protein of 18 mg/dL and markedly elevated ferritin of 2500 ng/mL. Chest radiograph showed patchy bilateral alveolar infiltrates. His clinical presentation was consistent with severe COVID-19 infection causing acute respiratory distress syndrome. The patient was initiated on bi-level positive pressure ventilation, but his respiratory status continued to worsen, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. He was managed with low tidal volume ventilation and ARDS-network protocol. Treatment with remdesivir, dexamethasone, and convalescent plasma was initiated. On day 10 of admission patient developed fever, increasing oxygen requirement, and hypotension concerning for sepsis. Empiric treatment with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam was started after obtaining blood cultures, which grew Elizabethkingia meningoseptica resistant to all beta-lactam antibiotics (penicillins and cephalosporins). Intravenous trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole was started but later switched to clindamycin due to electrolyte abnormalities. Therapy was continued for two weeks, and repeat blood cultures were sterile. His hospital course was complicated by prolonged ventilator weaning, acute kidney injury, and hospital-acquired pneumonia. He was successfully extubated to a high-flow nasal cannula after twenty days and is currently being managed for delirium. Elizabethkingia meningoseptica causes neonatal meningitis and nosocomial sepsis in older adults with underlying chronic comorbidities or immunocompromised status like an organ transplant receiving immunosuppressive therapy, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, and end-stage renal disease. Mortality is high and ranges from 30%- 50%. It is usually resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics, carbapenems, and aminoglycosides. Some isolates have shown varying susceptibility to fluoroquinolones, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, minocycline, and tigecycline. With the increasing use of steroids and prolonged critical illness in patients with COVID-19 infection, this emerging pathogen is a paramount health concern during the pandemic.","Rahi, M.; Amoah, K.; Gunasekaran, K.; Kapil, R.; Kwon, J.

BACKGROUND: Clinicians, patients, and researchers depend on valid measurements of medication adherence to inform the delivery of preemptive care when needed. Technology is routinely used for monitoring medication adherence in both clinical practice and research, yet there is a dearth of research comparing novel App based approaches to traditional approaches used for assessing medication adherence. METHODS: Adherence rates were captured on both the EM and the App for 3697 daily observations from 44 participants with acute coronary syndrome over 90 days immediately following discharge from acute care. For EM, adherence was measured using EM equipped pill bottles. For the App, adherence was measured by having participants upload daily photos to the App prior to taking their daily aspirin. Agreement was assessed using a Bland-Altman analysis. RESULTS: The mean adherence rate was higher on the App, 92%, than the EM, 78% (p < 0.001). The mean difference in adherence rates between these methods was 14% (95% Confidence Interval: -23%, -5%). CONCLUSIONS: These findings illustrate a lack of agreement between technological interventions used for measuring adherence in cardiovascular patient populations, with higher adherence rates observed with the App compared to EM. These findings are salient given the increased reliance on telehealth due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Giordano, Nicholas A; Riman, Kathryn A; French, Rachel; Daus, Marguerite; Stephens-Shields, Alisa J; Kimmel, Stephen E; Riegel, Barbara",Appl Nurs Res,279,16

This article systematically reviewed the available data on the benefits of interventions to reduce adverse mental health sequelae of infectious disease outbreaks, and to offer guidance for mental health service responses to infectious disease pandemic. PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, PsycINFO, WHO Global Research Database on infectious disease, and the preprint server medRxiv were searched. Of 4278 reports identified, 32 were included in this review. Most articles of psychological interventions were implemented to address the impact of COVID-19 pandemic, followed by Ebola, SARS, and MERS for multiple vulnerable populations. Increasing mental health literacy of the public is vital to prevent the mental health crisis under the COVID-19 pandemic. Group-based cognitive behavioral therapy, psychological first aid, community-based psychosocial arts program, and other culturally adapted interventions were reported as being effective against the mental health impacts of COVID-19, Ebola, and SARS. Culturally-adapted, cost-effective, and accessible strategies integrated into the public health emergency response and established medical systems at the local and national levels are likely to be an effective option to enhance mental health response capacity for the current and for future infectious disease outbreaks.

The current pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐ CoV‐2) is the third coronavirus outbreak, following severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses. Since the initial cases of a pneumonia of unknown aetiology, which was later identified as COVID-19 in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, there has been much debate and speculation regarding the origins of this novel virus. This review aims to provide an insight into the origin of SARS-CoV-2 by reflecting on genomic data gathered thus far. Identifying the origins of SARS-CoV-2 can lead to better understanding of hidden viral reservoirs that may exist and pose a threat to society as well as allow greater understanding of the mechanisms by which these viruses have successfully achieved cross species transmission. Greater knowledge in regard to this can lead to the development of strategies which can aid in preventing future outbreaks of this scale.","Shahzad, Fanila; Nasim, Md Talat",Bangladesh J. Med.

Tuberculosis (TB) remains the top infectious disease killer, but apart from syndemic TB/HIV little is known regarding the interaction of viral epidemics and pandemics with TB. The aim of this consensus-based document is to describe the effects of viral infections resulting in epidemics and pandemics that affect the lung (MERS, SARS, HIV, influenza A (H1N1)pdm/09 and COVID-19) and their interactions with TB. A search of the scientific literature was performed. A writing committee of international experts including the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control Public Health Emergency (ECDC PHE) team, the World Association for Infectious Diseases and Immunological Disorders (WAidid), the Global Tuberculosis Network (GTN), and members of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) Study Group for Mycobacterial Infections (ESGMYC) was established. Consensus was achieved after multiple rounds of revisions between the writing committee and a larger expert group. A Delphi process involving the core group of authors (excluding the ECDC PHE team) identified the areas requiring review/consensus, followed by a second round to refine the definitive consensus elements. The epidemiology and immunology of these viral infections and their interactions with TB are discussed with implications for diagnosis, treatment and prevention of airborne infections (infection control, viral containment and workplace safety).

Yet, connecting these relationships to population growth, especially for multiple populations within a species, is lacking and precludes our understanding of amphibian population dynamics and distributions. Therefore, we constructed integral projection models for five populations along an elevational gradient to determine how climate and season affect population growth of a terrestrial salamander Plethodon montanus and the importance of demographic vital rates to population growth under varying climate scenarios. We found that population growth was typically higher at the highest elevation compared to the lower elevations, whereas varying inactive season conditions, represented by the late fall, winter and early spring, produced a greater variation in population growth than varying active season conditions (late spring, summer, and early fall). Furthermore, survival and growth were consistently more important, as measured by elasticity, compared to fecundity, and large females had the greatest elasticity compared to all other body sizes. Our results suggest that changing inactive season conditions, especially those that would affect the survival of large individuals, may have the greatest impact on population growth. We recommend future experimental studies focus on the inactive season to better elucidate the mechanisms by which these conditions can affect survival.","Caruso, Nicholas M; Staudhammer, Christina L; Rissler, Leslie J",Oecologia,279,2

In this work, we focus on Catalan with the aim to explore to what extent a medium-sized monolingual language model is competitive with state-of-the-art large multilingual models. For this, we: (1) build a clean, high-quality textual Catalan corpus (CaText), the largest to date (but only a fraction of the usual size of the previous work in monolingual language models), (2) train a Transformer-based language model for Catalan (BERTa), and (3) devise a thorough evaluation in a diversity of settings, comprising a complete array of downstream tasks, namely, Part of Speech Tagging, Named Entity Recognition and Classification, Text Classification, Question Answering, and Semantic Textual Similarity, with most of the corresponding datasets being created ex novo. The result is a new benchmark, the Catalan Language Understanding Benchmark (CLUB), which we publish as an open resource, together with the clean textual corpus, the language model, and the cleaning pipeline.

The early detection of COVID-19 is key to combating its outbreak and could help bring this pandemic to an end. One of the biggest challenges in combating COVID-19 is accurate testing for the disease. Utilizing the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect COVID-19 from chest X-ray images can help radiologists compare and validate their results with an automated system. In this paper, we propose a carefully designed network, dubbed CORONA-Net, that can accurately detect COVID-19 from chest X-ray images. CORONA-Net is divided into two phases: (1) The reinitialization phase and (2) the classification phase. In the reinitialization phase, the network consists of encoder and decoder networks. The objective of this phase is to train and initialize the encoder and decoder networks by a distribution that comes out of medical images. In the classification phase, the decoder network is removed from CORONA-Net, and the encoder network acts as a backbone network to fine-tune the classification phase based on the learned weights from the reinitialization phase. Extensive experiments were performed on a publicly available dataset, COVIDx, and the results show that CORONA-Net significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art networks with an overall accuracy of 95.84%.","Elbishlawi, Sherif Abdelpakey Mohamed H.; Shehata, Mohamed S.; Mohamed, Mostafa M.",Journal of Imaging,279,24

Inactivated COVID-19 vaccine is one of these options and has been administered to more than 7 million people in Turkey. Inactivated vaccines are generally considered safe. Kounis syndrome (KS) is a rare clinical condition defined as the co-existence of acute coronary syndromes and allergic reactions. Case Report We present the case of a 41-year-old woman with no cardiovascular risk factors who was admitted at our emergency department with flushing, palpitation, dyspnea, and chest pain 15 min after the first dose of inactivated CoronaVac (Sinovac Life Sciences, Beijing, China). Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed V4-6 T wave inversion, and echocardiography revealed left ventricular wall motion abnormalities. Troponin-I level on arrival was elevated. Coronary angiography showed no sign of coronary atherosclerosis. She was diagnosed with type 1 KS. The patient's symptoms resolved and she was discharged from hospital in a good condition. Why Should an Emergency Physician Be Aware of This? To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of allergic myocardial infarction secondary to inactivated coronavirus vaccine. This case demonstrates that KS can occur after inactivated virus vaccine against COVID-19. Although the risk of severe allergic reaction after administration of CoronaVac seems to be very low, people who developed chest pain after vaccine administration should be followed by ECG and troponin measurements.","Özdemir, Ibrahim Halil; Özlek, Bülent; Özen, Mehmet Burak; Gündüz, Ramazan; Bayturan, Özgür",J. emerg. med,279,5

While there is evidence that some diseases are associated with an increased risk for development of a more severe course of COVID-19, little is known on protective conditions. Importantly, clearance of viral infection and protection against disease manifestation crucially depends on functional innate and adaptive immunity and the interferon signalling axis. Here, we hypothesize that patients with non-segmental vitiligo (NSV), an autoimmune skin (and mucosal) disorder, may clear SARS-CoV-2 infection more efficiently and have a lower risk of COVID-19 development. Conversely, in case of COVID-19 development, vitiligo autoimmunity may influence the cytokine storm-related disease burden. In addition, immune activation during SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 disease might increase vitiligo disease activity. Our hypothesis is based on the shift of the immune system in NSV towards adaptive type 1 (IFNÎ³ and CD8 T cells) and innate immune responses. Identified susceptibility genes of NSV patients may further confer increased antiviral activity. To validate our hypothesis, we suggest an international consortium to perform a retrospective data registry and patient-reported study on a large number of NSV patients worldwide during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Post, Nicoline F; Luiten, Rosalie M; Wolkerstorfer, Albert; Bekkenk, Marcel W; Böhm, Markus",Exp. dermatol,279,16

The South Korean government has been recommending a collection of guidelines now known as social distancing, leading to reduced human activities. This study analyzes changes in the concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) during the 30-day periods before and since the start of social distancing on 29 February 2020 using measurement data from air quality monitoring stations at various locations of the seven major cities of South Korea, namely, Seoul, Busan, Incheon, Daegu, Daejeon, Gwangju, and Ulsan. All seven cities experienced decreased levels of PM2.5 concentration by up to 25% and smaller fluctuations during the period of social distancing. Inter-city comparisons show that the PM2.5 concentration changes are positively correlated with the city-wide PM2.5 emission fractions for mobile sources and negatively correlated with the city-wide PM2.5 emission fractions for combustion and industrial process sources. In addition, the meteorological influences favorable for transboundary pollutant transport have weakened during the period under COVID-19 social distancing. Intra-city comparisons show that decreases in the intra-city variability of PM2.5 concentration were larger in coastal cities than in inland cities. Comparisons between the inter- and intra-city variabilities in the PM2.5 concentration changes under social distancing highlight the importance of taking into account intra-city variabilities in addition to inter-city variabilities.","Kwak, Kyung-Hwan; Han, Beom-Soon; Park, Kyeongjoo; Moon, Sungju; Jin, Han-Gyul; Park, Seung-Bu; Baik, Jong-Jin",Air Qual Atmos Health,279,13

The current coronavirus pandemic is viewed as the newest form of health and socio-economic crisis that has disrupted the flow of normal life for millions. Viewing the pandemic as a unique or unpredictable occurrence shifts responsibility and accountability from a host of institutional actors to those who were unable to protect themselves from the direct and indirect effects of the pandemic and incurred heavy losses. Situating the pandemic within the well-established policy debates around disasters enables us to understand how the novel coronavirus rapidly transformed into a humanitarian crisis in India. Successful disaster risk reduction involves the creation of a “culture of resilience” but resilience thinking has been criticized as lacking in “moral compass”, showing a poor understanding of power relations and as governance that emphasizes individual responsibility. Chronically poor people can be “resilient” at the expense of their long-term wellbeing. Drawing on the moral, political and philosophical debates about the shift toward “resilience” in global disaster policy, this article examines the rhetoric of “self-reliance” to address COVID-19 dislocation. We find that disaster policies that rely mainly on resilience and compliance increase state power while absolving them of responsibility. © 2021 Taylor & Francis.","Sengupta, S.; Jha, M.

METHODS: This is an international multicenter observational study in 20 US and European hospitals. Patients suspected of COVID-19 were tested with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) swab test and had an LUS examination. We identified three clinical phenotypes based on pre-existing chronic diseases (mixed phenotype), and on the presence (severe phenotype) or absence (mild phenotype) of signs and/or symptoms of respiratory failure at presentation. We defined the LUS likelihood of COVID-19 pneumonia according to four different patterns: high (HighLUS), intermediate (IntLUS), alternative (AltLUS), and low (LowLUS) probability. The combination of patterns and phenotypes with RT-PCR results was described and analyzed. RESULTS: We studied 1462 patients, classified in mild (n = 400), severe (n = 727), and mixed (n = 335) phenotypes. HighLUS and IntLUS showed an overall sensitivity of 90.2% (95% CI 88.23-91.97%) in identifying patients with positive RT-PCR, with higher values in the mixed (94.7%) and severe phenotype (97.1%), and even higher in those patients with objective respiratory failure (99.3%). The HighLUS showed a specificity of 88.8% (CI 85.55-91.65%) that was higher in the mild phenotype (94.4%; CI 90.0-97.0%). At multivariate analysis, the HighLUS was a strong independent predictor of RT-PCR positivity (odds ratio 4.2, confidence interval 2.6-6.7, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Combining LUS patterns of probability with clinical phenotypes at presentation can rapidly identify those patients with or without COVID-19 pneumonia at bedside. This approach could support and expedite patients' management during a pandemic surge.","Volpicelli, Giovanni; Gargani, Luna; Perlini, Stefano; Spinelli, Stefano; Barbieri, Greta; Lanotte, Antonella; Casasola, Gonzalo García; Nogué-Bou, Ramon; Lamorte, Alessandro; Agricola, Eustachio; Villén, Tomas; Deol, Paramjeet Singh; Nazerian, Peiman; Corradi, Francesco; Stefanone, Valerio; Fraga, Denise Nicole; Navalesi, Paolo; Ferre, Robinson; Boero, Enrico; Martinelli, Giampaolo; Cristoni, Lorenzo; Perani, Cristiano; Vetrugno, Luigi; McDermott, Cian; Miralles-Aguiar, Francisco; Secco, Gianmarco; Zattera, Caterina; Salinaro, Francesco; Grignaschi, Alice; Boccatonda, Andrea; Giostra, Fabrizio; Infante, Marta Nogué; Covella, Michele; Ingallina, Giacomo; Burkert, Julia; Frumento, Paolo; Forfori, Francesco; Ghiadoni, Lorenzo",Intensive Care Med,279,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 RT PCR, admitted to ICU between March and April 2020 were enrolled. At ICU admission, BALF were analyzed by flow cytometry. Univariate, multivariate and Spearman correlation analyses were performed. RESULTS: Sixty-four patients were enrolled, median age of 64 years (IQR 58-69). The majority cells in the BALF were neutrophils (70%, IQR 37.5-90.5) and macrophages (27%, IQR 7-49) while a minority were lymphocytes, 1%, TCD3+ 92% (IQR 82-95). The ICU mortality was 32.8%. Non-survivors had a significantly older age (p = 0.033) and peripheral lymphocytes (p = 0.012) were lower compared to the survivors. At multivariate analysis the percentage of macrophages in the BALF correlated with poor outcome (OR 1.336, CI95% 1.014-1.759, p = 0.039). CONCLUSIONS: In critically ill patients, BALF cellularity is mainly composed of neutrophils and macrophages. The macrophages percentage in the BALF at ICU admittance correlated with higher ICU mortality. The lack of lymphocytes in BALF could partly explain a reduced anti-viral response.","Dentone, Chiara; Vena, Antonio; Loconte, Maurizio; Grillo, Federica; Brunetti, Iole; Barisione, Emanuela; Tedone, Elisabetta; Mora, Sara; Di Biagio, Antonio; Orsi, Andrea; De Maria, Andrea; Nicolini, Laura; Ball, Lorenzo; Giacobbe, Daniele Roberto; Magnasco, Laura; Delfino, Emanuele; Mastracci, Luca; Mangerini, Rosa; Taramasso, Lucia; Sepulcri, Chiara; Pincino, Rachele; Bavastro, Martina; Cerchiaro, Matteo; Mikulska, Malgorzata; Bruzzone, Bianca; Icardi, Giancarlo; Frisoni, Paolo; Gratarola, Angelo; Patroniti, Nicolò; Pelosi, Paolo; Bassetti, Matteo",BMC Infect Dis,279,0

METHODS: PubMed and Google Scholar searches were carried out using the keywords. Pertinent clinical information related to pediatric otolaryngology was reviewed from journals, Texas Medical Board guidelines as well as institutional guidelines. Updated information from the Centers for Disease Control through social media was identified via Google search. STUDY DESIGN: Safety measures and clinical work-flow protocols were developed to protect patients, families, and staff. Protocols included a rotation schedule for providers and ancillary staff, guidelines for in-clinic visits and alteration to surgical block and surgical case cadence to minimize exposure of providers and staff to COVID-19. Algorithms and guidelines were reviewed and revisions made at each phase of the pandemic related to in-clinic visits, telemedicine visits, and surgical cases. CONCLUSION: In the era of the COVID-19 pandemic, otolaryngologists and pediatric otolaryngologists are amongst sub-specialties with an increased risk of exposure. It is imperative that a modification in clinical workflow is created to minimize the risk of exposure to providers and staff while continuing to provide care to patients.

However, challenges exist in obtaining the maximum yield from industrial fermentations. One challenge arises from the nature of alcohols. These compounds are chaotropic (i.e. causes disorder in the system) which causes stress in the microbes producing the biofuel. Brewer's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) typically cannot grow at ethanol concentration much above 17% (v/v). Mitigation of these properties has the potential to increase yield. Previously, we have explored the effects of chaotropes on model enzyme systems and attempted (largely unsuccessfully) to offset these effects by kosmotropes (compounds which increase the order of the system, i.e. the ""opposite"" of chaotropes). Here we present some theoretical results which suggest that high molecular mass polyethylene glycols may be the most effective kosmotropic additives in terms of both efficacy and cost. The assumptions and limitations of these calculations are also presented. A deeper understanding of the effects of chaotropes on biofuel-producing microbes is likely to inform improvements in bioethanol yields and enable more rational approaches to the ""neutralisation"" of chaotropicity.","Timson, David J; Eardley, Joshua",Appl. biochem. biotechnol,279,1

Objective This is an observational case-control study that compares the results of PT in ICU patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) prospectively enrolled to a similar group of subjects, retrospectively recruited, without COVID-19. Methods Ninety-eight consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU at Pisa Azienda Ospedaliero Universitaria Pisana between March 11th and May 20th, 2020 were prospectively studied. Thirty of them underwent PT using different techniques. Another 30 non-COVID-19 ICU patients were used as a control-group. The main outcome was to evaluate the safety and feasibility of PT in COVID-19 patients. We measured the rate of complications. Results Percutaneous tracheostomy was performed with different techniques in 30 of the 98 COVID-19 ICU patients admitted to the ICU. Tracheostomy was performed on day 10 (mean 10 ± 3.3) from the time of intubation. Major tracheal complications occurred in 5 patients during the procedure. In the control group of 30 ICU patients, no differences were found with regards to the timing of the tracheostomy, whereas a statistically significant difference was observed regarding complications with only one tracheal ring rupture reported. Conclusion Percutaneous tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients showed a higher rate of complications compared with controls even though the same precautions and the same expertise were applied. Larger studies are needed to understand whether the coronavirus disease itself carries an increased risk of tracheal damage.","Bertini, Pietro; Forfori, Francesco; Bruschini, Luca; Corradi, Francesco; Ribechini, Alessandro; Brogi, Etrusca; Guarracino, Fabio",Int. arch. otorhinolaryngol.

These emerging health inequalities mirror those already evident in UK society. AIM: The aim of this study was to understand how COVID-19 and the associated imposed restrictions affected the lives of people from the Muslim community living in the North West of England. METHOD: Twenty-five in-depth qualitative interviews and four focus groups (n = 22) explored individual experiences of COVID-19 and imposed restrictions. Data were analysed thematically. FINDINGS: The virus and associated imposed restrictions had negative impacts on the psychological wellbeing of participants, their families and the wider community. Worry and low mood were particular features of participant's pandemic stories. Main concerns were those of contracting and transmitting the virus to others and employment-related difficulties. Low mood was particularly linked to the impact of restrictions on fundamental interactions embedded within cultural and religious practices. These practices are central to feelings of belonging and connectedness within the Muslim community. Religious beliefs were important in helping to mitigate psychological distress for some participants. CONCLUSION: Psychological distress was associated with COVID-19 virus and impact of COVID-19 restrictions on livelihoods and fundamental human interactions. Better provision of culturally appropriate information, improving local channels of communication and practical support are important during times of pandemic when usual support systems may be disrupted.","Hassan, Shaima M; Ring, Adele; Tahir, Naheed; Gabbay, Mark",BMC Public Health,279,16

Some diseases, for instance diabetes, is continuously suggested as a risk factor which contributes to the severity and mortality of COVID-19. However, to date, there are no comprehensive studies aiming to explain the exact relationship between diabetes and COVID-19. Thus, this study aims to summarize the evidence about diabetes and COVID-19 outbreak through a systematic review and meta-analysis approach. METHOD: A literature review was implemented within databases of Scopus, PubMed, Science direct, and Web of science. Observational reviews, case-report, and case-series studies that assessed the diabetes in COVID-19 patients, were included. Data extraction and assessment were guided by PRISMA checklist. FINDINGS: Some studies suggest that there were no significant differences in symptoms between patients who suffered from both diabetes and COVID-19 and those who only suffered COVID-19. In the subsequent meta-analysis 14.5% of the subjects were diabetic patient. These clients have poor ARDS prognosis, severe symptoms, and the death rate is higher among COVID-19 patients. In addition, it is suggested the diabetic patients will be treated with antibiotics, antivirals, and HCQ. CONCLUSION: The results of this study show that diabetes is a risk factor - and contributes to the severity and mortality of patients with COVID-19. This paper also provides recommendations and guidelines for which could be useful for prevention and treatment of diabetic patients affected by COVID-19.","Abdi, Alireza; Jalilian, Milad; Sarbarzeh, Pegah Ahmadi; Vlaisavljevic, Zeljko",Diabetes Res Clin Pract,279,1

The lockdown that took place in Spain between the months of March and May 2020 may have led to behavioural changes. The aim of the present study was to assess adherence to the MDiet at the end of the lockdown period and to compare it with the situation prior to it. METHODS: Data were obtained by means of 2online questionnaires, one at the beginning of lockdown and the other at the end, completed by adults from the Spanish population, who responded anonymously and voluntarily. The assessment of adherence to the MDiet was carried out using 2questionnaires: Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) and modified PREDIMED, which contained 14 questions each. Other variables included were: age, gender, body mass index (BMI), autonomous community of origin, home living conditions, and level of studies achieved. At the end of the lockdown period, the comparison was made using the Student t statistic and the McNemar test. RESULTS: A total of 207 people (137 women) participated, with a mean age 51.3±12.4 years, age range: 20-83 years. After lockdown, BMI remained unchanged (initial 24.55±3.7kg/m2 and final 24.57±3.7kg/m2, P=.752), as well as fish consumption (initial 51.2%) and 60.9% at the end, P=.003), mainly due to the women, and adherence to the Mdiet. The mean total score of MEDAS increased with 10.16±2.0 at the beginning, and 10.57±2.0 at the end; P=.001). This also occurred with the modified PREDIMED (9.47±2.1 at the beginning and 9.93±2.1 at the end, P<.001). Similarly, the proportion of participants that had a score classified as high at the beginning increased at the end of lockdown: from 80.7% initially in MEDAS to 87.9% at the end (P=.021) and from 68.6% initially in modified PREDIMED to 75.8% at the end (P=.037). CONCLUSIONS: In the study sample, during lockdown there were no changes in BMI, but there were increases in fish consumption and adherence to the MDiet.","Carbayo Herencia, Julio A; Rosich, Nuria; Panisello Royo, Josefa María; Carro, Amelia; Allins Presas, Josep; Panisello, Moisés; Solera Albero, Juan; Tárraga López, Pedro J",Clin. investig. arterioscler.

Here, we present the final analysis outcomes. METHODS: A prospective, multicenter, non-interventional study involving patients who received tolvaptan for the treatment of liver cirrhosis with hepatic edema with an insufficient response to conventional diuretics. The observation period was up to 6 months. Effectiveness evaluation included changes in body weight and clinical symptoms. Safety analysis included evaluation of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). RESULTS: Case reports of 1111 patients were collected. Of these, 1109 were included in the safety analysis and 1098 in the effectiveness analysis. The mean age was 69.4 ± 11.5 years and 695 (62.7%) patients were male. After tolvaptan treatment, a decrease in body weight from baseline was - 2.6 ± 2.7 kg on day 7 and - 3.8 ± 4.1 kg on day 14. Moreover, clinical symptoms significantly improved over the 14-day treatment. Frequently reported ADRs were thirst (6.6%), hepatic encephalopathy (2.3%), dehydration (1.5%), and hypernatremia (1.2%). A serum sodium level of &#8805; 150 mEq/L was reported in five patients (0.5%). Multivariate analyses showed that the baseline blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level (cut-off value: 22.4 mg/dL) was the predictive factor for tolvaptan treatment response. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that tolvaptan was effective and well-tolerated in liver cirrhosis patients with hepatic edema. In the real-world clinical setting, tolvaptan provides a useful option for the treatment of hepatic edema.","Sakaida, Isao; Terai, Shuji; Kurosaki, Masayuki; Okada, Mitsuru; Hirano, Takahiro; Fukuta, Yasuhiko",J. gastroenterol,279,1

This explosion of information has stimulated interest in automated tools to help identify useful knowledge. We have pursued the use of methods for extracting diverse forms of mechanism relations from the natural language of scientific papers. We seek to identify concepts in COVID-19 and related literature which represent activities, functions, associations and causal relations, ranging from cellular processes to economic impacts. We formulate a broad, coarse-grained schema targeting mechanism relations between open, free-form entities. Our approach strikes a balance between expressivity and breadth that supports generalization across diverse concepts. We curate a dataset of scientific papers annotated according to our novel schema. Using an information extraction model trained on this new corpus, we construct a knowledge base (KB) of 2M mechanism relations, which we make publicly available. Our model is able to extract relations at an F1 at least twice that of baselines such as open IE or related scientific IE systems. We conduct experiments examining the ability of our system to retrieve relevant information on viral mechanisms of action, and on applications of AI to COVID-19 research.

Studies in vitro with the MDA-MB-231 cell line showed that only Ru(BAC) and Ru(GAC) interacted with BSA. Besides that, the Ru(GAC) complex, which has a polyphenolic acid, interacted in an apo-Tf structure and function dependent manner and it was able to inhibit the formation of reactive oxygen species. Ru(GAC) was able to cause damage to the cellular cytoskeleton leading to inhibition of some cellular processes of TNBC cells, such as invasion, migration, and adhesion.","Graminha, Angelica E; Honorato, João; Correa, Rodrigo S; Cominetti, Marcia R; Menezes, Antônio C S; Batista, Alzir A",Dalton trans (2003.

For the most part, how these changes ultimately affect the safety and accessibility of food around the world remains to be seen.","Cable, Jennifer; Jaykus, Lee-Ann; Hoelzer, Karin; Newton, John; Torero, Maximo",Ann.

Institutional responses to the demand for patient care reduced the time many residents have to pursue clinical electives, scholarship projects, and other experiences meant to clarify and advance their personal and professional goals. Moreover, many academic medical centers experienced profound fiscal losses that require thoughtful revisions to budgets and curricula. In this article, the authors recommend strategies for residency programs to mitigate these losses and capitalize on growth in virtual education, scholarship opportunities, and relationships arising from the pandemic. Drawing from career development guidelines from the National Career Development Association and existing literature about factors associated with positive career outcomes, the authors suggest leadership roles, curricula, and events that training programs can quickly and inexpensively implement to help residents grow as professionals, achieve personal training goals, produce scholarship, and attain future employment. To help trainees manage their careers, the authors recommend structured mentorship and education in career pathways and the preparation of job application materials. To foster attainment of specific knowledge and cultivate lifelong learning, the authors recommend leveraging existing resources to provide time, funding, academic coaching, and skills training for scholarship projects. To promote development of effective work relationships and community, the authors recommend appointment of a faculty champion for career advancement, scholarship showcases, attendance at virtual journal clubs, and networking through social media outlets. These recommendations for supporting career advancement may apply to early career faculty development as well as undergraduate and postgraduate medical education beyond the pandemic era. Outcomes studies will be needed to evaluate the impact of these recommendations.","Vande Vusse, Lisa K; Ryder, Hilary F; Best, Jennifer A",Acad. med,279,22

Conceptual and methodological considerations to delineating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on substance use and disorder,19.60638,4.6137023,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the global spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has led to a staggering number of deaths worldwide and significantly increased burden on healthcare as nations scramble to find mitigation strategies. While significant progress has been made in COVID-19 diagnostics and therapeutics, effective prevention and treatment options remain scarce. Because of the potential for the SARS-CoV-2 infections to cause systemic inflammation and multiple organ failure, it is imperative for the scientific community to evaluate therapeutic options aimed at modulating the causative host immune responses to prevent subsequent systemic complications. Harnessing decades of expertise in the use of natural and synthetic materials for biomedical applications, the biomaterials community has the potential to play an especially instrumental role in developing new strategies or repurposing existing tools to prevent or treat complications resulting from the COVID-19 pathology. Leveraging microparticle- and nanoparticle-based technology, especially in pulmonary delivery, biomaterials have demonstrated the ability to effectively modulate inflammation and may be well-suited for resolving SARS-CoV-2-induced effects. Here, we provide an overview of the SARS-CoV-2 virus infection and highlight current understanding of the host's pulmonary immune response and its contributions to disease severity and systemic inflammation. Comparing to frontline COVID-19 therapeutic options, we highlight the most significant untapped opportunities in immune engineering of the host response using biomaterials and particle technology, which have the potential to improve outcomes for COVID-19 patients, and identify areas needed for future investigations. We hope that this work will prompt preclinical and clinical investigations of promising biomaterials-based treatments to introduce new options for COVID-19 patients.","Jarai, Bader M; Stillman, Zachary; Bomb, Kartik; Kloxin, April M; Fromen, Catherine A",,279,16

OBJECTIVE: Patient and health care provider surveys with regard to current perceptions of nasal allergy burden, symptoms, and treatments were conducted to compare with previous surveys and provide insight into the use of SLIT-tablets and AIT shared decision-making tools. METHODS: From November-December 2019, adults (N = 510) diagnosed with nasal allergies and health care providers (N = 304) who treated nasal allergies in the United States completed surveys with regard to nasal allergy management. RESULTS: Of the patient respondents, 42% reported that their symptoms were only somewhat controlled and 48% had avoided activities because of their nasal allergies. In all, 38% were using only over-the-counter (OTC) medications for treatment, and 42%, 7%, and 8% had ever received subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT), sublingual allergy drops, or SLIT-tablets, respectively; 56% and 85% reported that they had never discussed SCIT or SLIT, respectively, with their health care provider. Of the health care provider respondents, 45%, 58%, and 20% were very likely to discuss OTC medications, SCIT, or SLIT, respectively. Allergists were more inclined to discuss SCIT with their patients than other health care providers (82% versus 33%, respectively). Most allergists (67%) and other health care providers (62%) reported that they did not use an AIT shared decision-making tool, primarily because of unawareness. CONCLUSION: The patients with nasal allergies continued to report inadequate symptom control and activity impairment.SLIT-tablets and AIT shared decision-making tools were underused. In the coronavirus disease 2019 era, social distancing may limit office visits, which impacts SCIT administration and prompts increased use of telemedicine and a possible advantage for at-home-administered SLIT-tablets over SCIT.","Winders, Tonya; DuBuske, Lawrence; Bukstein, Don A; Meltzer, Eli O; Wallace, Dana; Rance, Karen",Allergy asthma proc,279,19

BACKGROUND: With the growing focus on health-related research in Danish design practice, knowing how to translate research findings into research-informed design strategies becomes a preferable, if not (yet) a critical, skill. This calls for architecture educations to reconsider their graduate profiles and teaching curricula, thereby addressing research-to-practice gap. METHOD: Based on design project hand-ins, we evaluate whether students participating in the AHW course demonstrate greater sensibility toward user experiences and research-based design (RBD) in their master thesis projects, compared to students attending a more traditional architectural tectonic track. Evaluation relates to the use of scientific literature and theoretical frameworks on topics like ""healing architecture"" and applied user-oriented methods (interviews, personas, demographics). RESULTS: Our explorative analysis indicates that students have the skills to make a detailed user analysis when it comes to well-defined user groups in a highly specialized building (e.g., hospice patients and staff). The extent to which health-related research and user perspectives are applied in the design process seems to be primarily driven by thematic focus of the project (welfare buildings in contrast to housing). CONCLUSION: Despite the challenges in teaching students to assess and apply academic literature, a RBD paradigm in architectural education can help bridge emerging research knowledge with design skills and professional competencies.","Tvedebrink, Tenna Doktor Olsen; Jelic, Andrea",HERD,279,16

As a result, COVID-19 has changed all our lives as we battle to curtail the spread of the infection in the absence of specific therapies against coronaviruses and in anticipation of a proven safe and efficacious vaccine. Common with previous outbreaks of coronavirus infections, SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome, COVID-19 can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that arises due to an imbalanced immune response. While several repurposed antiviral and host-response drugs are under examination as potential treatments, other novel therapeutics are also being explored to alleviate the effects on critically ill patients. The use of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) for COVID-19 has become an attractive avenue down which almost 70 different clinical trial teams have ventured. Successfully trialled for the treatment of other conditions such as multiple sclerosis, osteoarthritis and graft versus host disease, MSCs possess both regenerative and immunomodulatory properties, the latter of which can be harnessed to reduce the severity and longevity of ARDS in patients under intensive care due to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Canham, Maurice A; Campbell, John D M; Mountford, Joanne C",J Transl Med,279,16

Increased presenteeism, decreased absenteeism, and low uptake of the influenza vaccine can contribute to the spread of influenza among HCP in healthcare settings. We used a mixed methods approach to investigate attitudes and behaviors of HCP in Israel towards influenza vaccination, presenteeism, and absenteeism. METHODS: The study took place over three influenza seasons (2016-2017, 2017-2018, 2018-2019) at the largest hospital in southern Israel. We administered a Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices (KAP) questionnaire and conducted semi-structured interviews with HCP who had been recently ill with respiratory symptoms. The KAP questionnaire included closed-ended questions about attitudes and behaviors regarding influenza, working while sick, and influenza vaccination. The interviews investigated HCP's perceptions of influenza infection and attitudes about absenteeism, presenteeism, and the influenza vaccine. RESULTS: We conducted 74 semi-structured interviews over three influenza seasons. Four HCP were interviewed twice, in separate seasons for different illness episodes. The 70 individuals interviewed included 16 physicians, 45 nurses or technicians, and 9 administrative staff. The median age was 42.5 years (range: 25-60), and most (79%) were female. Half (50%) got vaccinated against influenza before their illness episode. In interviews, most HCP said they come to work while sick (presenteeism) due to a strong personal work ethic and an institutional culture that discourages taking sick leave (absenteeism). HCP expressed skepticism about the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine as well as concern that the influenza vaccine causes severe illness. DISCUSSION: Over three influenza seasons in Israel, HCP cited a number of reasons for working while sick, and doubted the usefulness of influenza vaccine. Addressing reasons for presenteeism and vaccine hesitancy among HCP is crucial to protect HCP and patients from influenza virus infection and other viral respiratory illnesses, such as COVID-19.","Gur-Arie, Rachel; Katz, Mark A; Hirsch, Avital; Greenberg, David; Malosh, Ryan; Newes-Adeyi, Gabriella; Davidovitch, Nadav; Rosenthal, Anat",Vaccine,279,1

This study aimed to evaluate the predictive value of 5 early warning scores based on the admission data of critical COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Overall, medical records of 319 COVID-19 patients were included in the study. Demographic and clinical characteristics on admission were used for calculating the Standardized Early Warning Score (SEWS), National Early Warning Score (NEWS), National Early Warning Score2 (NEWS2), Hamilton Early Warning Score (HEWS), and Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS). Data on the outcomes (survival or death) were collected for each case and extracted for overall and subgroup analysis. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were performed. RESULTS: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the SEWS, NEWS, NEWS2, HEWS, and MEWS in predicting mortality were 0.841 (95% CI: 0.765-0.916), 0.809 (95% CI: 0.727-0.891), 0.809 (95% CI: 0.727-0.891), 0.821 (95% CI: 0.748-0.895), and 0.670 (95% CI: 0.573-0.767), respectively.

Some case studies have shown COVID19 to cause cavitary lesions1,2 and others have shown COVID19 to cause pneumothorax3. We describe a case report of a young man with no significant past medical history who was hospitalized for COVID19 pneumonia and was subsequently developed a pneumothorax. Case Report: A 39-year-old male presented to the hospital for acute onset shortness of breath. On admission, he was found to have right-sided pneumothorax and a pigtail catheter was placed with a proper expansion of the right lung. Approximately one month previously, he had been admitted for mild COVID19 pneumonia and successfully treated with dexamethasone and was discharged home with stable condition.On further evaluation, chest CT revealed multiple cavitary lesions with one large cavitation in the inferior right upper lobe with prominent mediastinal and hilar nodes. Quantiferon gold, AFB x3, and mycobacterium complex PCR were all negative. Fungitell, 1-3 B-D gluten, and coccioides antibodies were also negative. The patient had no other suggestive features to warrant vasculitis or malignancy evaluation. Discussion:The importance of this case is recognizing the late sequela of COVID19 pneumonia such as cavitary lesions and pneumothorax as seen with our patient. Some studies showed the development of pneumothorax associated with COVID19 but no previous studies showed the development of these findings in a patient without any past pulmonary history3. We attributed the development of cavitary lesions to covid19 and subsequently, because of that, the patient developed pneumothorax. Conclusion: It is important to consider the long term sequela of COVID19 pneumonia especially in those we consider to have mild disease. It is important to minimize potential severe consequences such as pneumothorax which occurred due to intense coughing as seen with our patient.","Johnson, W.

Excessive information and misinformation can lead to belief in false information as well as reduce the accurate interpretation of true information. Such incorrect beliefs about the COVID-19 pandemic might lead to behavior that puts people at risk of both contracting and spreading the virus. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was two-fold. First, we attempted to gain insight into public beliefs about the novel coronavirus and COVID-19 in one of the worst hit countries: the United States. Second, we aimed to test whether a short intervention could improve people's belief accuracy by empowering them to consider scientific consensus when evaluating claims related to the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a 4-week longitudinal study among US citizens, starting on April 27, 2020, just after daily COVID-19 deaths in the United States had peaked. Each week, we measured participants' belief accuracy related to the coronavirus and COVID-19 by asking them to indicate to what extent they believed a number of true and false statements (split 50/50). Furthermore, each new survey wave included both the original statements and four new statements: two false and two true statements. Half of the participants were exposed to an intervention aimed at increasing belief accuracy. The intervention consisted of a short infographic that set out three steps to verify information by searching for and verifying a scientific consensus. RESULTS: A total of 1202 US citizens, balanced regarding age, gender, and ethnicity to approximate the US general public, completed the baseline (T0) wave survey. Retention rate for the follow-up waves- first follow-up wave (T1), second follow-up wave (T2), and final wave (T3)-was high (&#8805;85%). Mean scores of belief accuracy were high for all waves, with scores reflecting low belief in false statements and high belief in true statements; the belief accuracy scale ranged from -1, indicating completely inaccurate beliefs, to 1, indicating completely accurate beliefs (T0 mean 0.75, T1 mean 0.78, T2 mean 0.77, and T3 mean 0.75). Accurate beliefs were correlated with self-reported behavior aimed at preventing the coronavirus from spreading (eg, social distancing) (r at all waves was between 0.26 and 0.29 and all P values were less than .001) and were associated with trust in scientists (ie, higher trust was associated with more accurate beliefs), political orientation (ie, liberal, Democratic participants held more accurate beliefs than conservative, Republican participants), and the primary news source (ie, participants reporting CNN or Fox News as the main news source held less accurate beliefs than others). The intervention did not significantly improve belief accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: The supposed infodemic was not reflected in US citizens' beliefs about the COVID-19 pandemic. Most people were quite able to figure out the facts in these relatively early days of the crisis, calling into question the prevalence of misinformation and the public's susceptibility to misinformation.","van Stekelenburg, Aart; Schaap, Gabi; Veling, Harm; Buijzen, Moniek",J Med Internet Res,279,1

A major challenge in establishing wastewater surveillance programs, especially in remote areas, is the need for a well-equipped laboratory for sample analysis. Currently, no options exist for rapid, sensitive, mobile, and easy-to-use wastewater tests for SARS-CoV-2. The performance of the GeneXpert System, which offers cartridge-based, rapid molecular clinical testing for SARS-CoV-2 in a portable platform, was evaluated using wastewater as the input. The GeneXpert demonstrated a SARS-CoV-2 limit of detection in wastewater below 32 copies/mL with a sample processing time of less than an hour. Using wastewater samples collected from multiple sites across Canada during February and March 2021, a high overall agreement (97.8%) was observed between the GeneXpert assay and laboratory-developed tests regarding the presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, with the use of centrifugal filters the detection threshold of the GeneXpert system was improved to <10 copies/mL in wastewater. Finally, to support on-site wastewater surveillance, GeneXpert testing was implemented in Yellowknife, a remote community in Northern Canada where its use successfully alerted public health authorities to undetected transmission of COVID-19. The identification of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater triggered clinical testing of recent travelers and identification of new COVID-19 cases/clusters. Taken together, these results suggest the GeneXpert is a viable option for surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater in locations that do not have access to established testing laboratories.","Daigle, Jade; Racher, Kathleen; Hazenberg, Justin; Yeoman, Allan; Hannah, Heather; Duong, Diep; Mohammed, Umar; Spreitzer, Dave; Gregorchuk, Branden S.

However, the viral spike protein also has an RGD motif, suggesting that cell surface integrins may be co-receptors. We examined the sequences of ACE2 and integrins with the Eukaryotic Linear Motif (ELM) resource and identified candidate short linear motifs (SLiMs) in their short, unstructured, cytosolic tails with potential roles in endocytosis, membrane dynamics, autophagy, cytoskeleton, and cell signaling. These SLiM candidates are highly conserved in vertebrates and may interact with the µ2 subunit of the endocytosis-associated AP2 adaptor complex, as well as with various protein domains (namely, I-BAR, LC3, PDZ, PTB, and SH2) found in human signaling and regulatory proteins. Several motifs overlap in the tail sequences, suggesting that they may act as molecular switches, such as in response to tyrosine phosphorylation status. Candidate LC3-interacting region (LIR) motifs are present in the tails of integrin ß3 and ACE2, suggesting that these proteins could directly recruit autophagy components. Our findings identify several molecular links and testable hypotheses that could uncover mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 attachment, entry, and replication against which it may be possible to develop host-directed therapies that dampen viral infection and disease progression. Several of these SLiMs have now been validated to mediate the predicted peptide interactions.","Mészáros, Bálint; Sámano-Sánchez, Hugo; Alvarado-Valverde, Jesús; Calyseva, Jelena; Martínez-Pérez, Elizabeth; Alves, Renato; Shields, Denis C; Kumar, Manjeet; Rippmann, Friedrich; Chemes, Lucía B; Gibson, Toby J",Sci. signal,279,16

The objective of this study was to determine if current instrumentation in local hospital laboratories can accommodate the anticipated workload from COVID-19 infected patients in hospitals and a proposed field hospital in addition to testing for non-infected patients. METHODS: Simulation models predicted instrument throughput and turn-around-time for chemistry, ion-selective-electrode, and immunoassay tests using vendor-developed software with different workload scenarios. The expanded workload included tests from anticipated COVID patients in 2 local hospitals and a proposed field hospital with a COVID-specific test menu in addition to the pre-pandemic workload. RESULTS: Instrumentation throughput and turn-around time at each site was predicted. With additional COVID-patient beds in each hospital, the maximum throughput was approached with no impact on turnaround time. Addition of the field hospital workload led to significantly increased test turnaround times at each site. CONCLUSIONS: Simulation models depicted the analytic capacity and turn-around times for laboratory tests at each site and identified the laboratory best suited for field hospital laboratory support during the pandemic.","Lyon, Martha E; Bajkov, Andrew; Haugrud, Diane; Kyle, Barry D; Wu, Fang; Lyon, Andrew W",,279,13

It presents a unique therapeutic dilemma, as anticoagulation with heparin alone is insufficient to address the imbalance in fibrinolysis. And while the use of fibrinolytic agents could limit the disease severity, it is often associated with bleeding complications. There is a need for biomarkers that will guide the timely stratification of patients into those who may benefit from both anticoagulant and fibrinolytic therapies. PATIENT CONCERNS: All 3 patients presented with shortness of breath along with comorbidities predisposing them to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. One patient (Patient 3) also suffered from bilateral deep venous thrombosis. DIAGNOSES: All 3 patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and were eventually diagnosed with respiratory failure necessitating intubation. INTERVENTIONS: All 3 patients required mechanical ventilation support, 2 of which also required renal replacement therapy. All 3 patients were also placed on anticoagulation therapy. OUTCOMES: In Patients 1 and 2, the initial D-dimer levels of 0.97âµg/ml fibrinogen equivalent units (FEU) and 0.83âµg/ml FEU were only slightly elevated (normal <0.50âµg/ml FEU). They developed rising D-dimer levels to a peak of 13.21âµg/ml FEU and >20.0âµg/ml FEU, respectively, which dropped to 1.34âµg/ml FEU 8 days later in Patient 1 and to 2.94âµg/ml on hospital day 13 in Patient 2. In Patient 3, the D-dimer level on admission was found to be elevated to >20.00âµg/ml FEU together with imaging evidence of thrombosis. And although he received therapeutic heparin infusion, he still developed pulmonary embolism (PE) and his D-dimer level declined to 5.91âµg/ml FEU. Despite ""improvement"" in their D-dimer levels, all 3 patients succumbed to multi-system organ failure. On postmortem examination, numerous arterial and venous thromboses of varying ages, many consisting primarily of fibrin, were identified in the lungs of all patients. LESSONS: High D-dimer levels, with subsequent downtrend correlating with clinical deterioration, seems to be an indicator of fibrinolysis suppression. These findings can help form a hypothesis, as larger cohorts are necessary to demonstrate their reproducibility.","Manzoor, Daniel; Bui, Chau; Makhoul, Elias; Luthringer, Daniel; Marchevsky, Alberto; Volod, Oksana",Medicine (Baltimore),279,3

In this context, longitudinal data on proportions of positive results in different age groups are rare. Data on total positive counts and on shares of positive counts deriving from a private (MVZ) and a University (RWTH) laboratory were analyzed retrospectively and compared with public data on total positive counts of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). Data were covered for Weeks 9-24 of the year 2020 and all patient ages. Total positive counts were lower in children compared to adults. Proportions of children and adults tested positive were 3%-5% and 5%-7%, respectively. RKI and MVZ data showed similar time-related patterns. Patients of 20-60 years of age did account for the initial virus spread (maximum infection rates at Weeks 9-11). Thereafter, infection rates decreased in older patients whereas children did not show a comparable time-related decrease. Pediatric data generated in outpatient settings and hospitals differed markedly which should be considered in further studies. In summary, compared with adults children are less affected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections and are unlikely to account for the initial viral spread. However, children show sustained viral activity and may serve as a viral reservoir.","Häusler, Martin; van Helden, Josef; Kleines, Michael",J. med. virol,279,26

METHOD: the sample consisted of 44 newborns, divided into two groups. The study group was composed of 22 premature newborns with intraventricular hemorrhage/and the control group was composed of 22 newborns without intraventricular hemorrhage, matched to the study group for gestational age, correct gestational age and sex. The groups were submitted to the evaluation of the inhibitory effect of auditory efferent in otoacoustic emissions (equipment ILOv6-Otodynamics Ltda®) and auditory evoked potential with and without contralateral noise (equipment SmartEP-Intelligent Hearing Systems®). RESULTS: newborns with intraventricular hemorrhage exhibited a higher occurrence of central hearing alteration as well as a lesser occurrence of the inhibitory effect of auditory efferent in otoacoustic emissions and auditory evoked potential compared to the newborns without this condition. An association was found between central hearing alteration and a lower occurrence of inhibitory effect. Agreement was found between the inhibitory effect test on otoacoustic emissions and latency of the auditory evoked potential. CONCLUSION: premature newborns with intraventricular hemorrhage have a greater occurrence of functional abnormality of the afferent auditory system, which can be effectively identified through an evaluation of the inhibitory effect of auditory efferent in otoacoustic emissions evoked by a transient stimulus and latency parameter in the brainstem auditory evoked potential.","Maruta, Elaine Colombo Sousa; Azevedo, Marisa Frasson de",Codas,279,16

The question arises at various points in the procedure for and process of involuntary commitment whether procedural modifications or further restrictive measures are necessary to minimise the spread of COVID-19 and protect all people involved from infection. In the light of current developments in Germany, this article examines under which conditions changes in the treatment of people under involuntary commitment are ethically justified in view of the COVID-19 pandemic. Among others, we discuss ethical arguments for and against involuntary commitments with reference to COVID-19, the use of different coercive interventions, the introduction of video hearings, an increased use of video surveillance and interventions based on the German Infection Protection Act. We argue that strict hygiene concepts, the provision of sufficient personal protective equipment and frequent testing for COVID-19 should be the central strategies to ensure the best possible protection against infection. Any further restrictions of the liberty of people under involuntary commitment require a sound ethical justification based on the criteria of suitability, necessity and proportionality. A strict compliance with these criteria and the continued oversight by external and independent control mechanisms are important to prevent ethically unjustified restrictions and discrimination against people with the diagnosis of a mental disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Gather, J; Juckel, G; Henking, T; Efkemann, S A; Vollmann, J; Scholten, M",Int J Law Psychiatry,279,1

Existing molecular profiling studies have focused on analysing functional omics data of a single type, which captures changes in a small subset of the molecular perturbations caused by the virus. As the logical next step, results from multiple such omics analysis may be aggregated to comprehensively interpret the molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2. An alternative approach is to integrate data simultaneously in a parallel fashion to highlight the inter-relationships of disease-driving biomolecules, in contrast to comparing processed information from each omics level separately. We demonstrate that valuable information may be masked by using the former fragmented views in analysis, and biomarkers resulting from such an approach cannot provide a systematic understanding of the disease aetiology. Hence, we present a generic, reproducible and flexible open-access data harmonisation framework that can be scaled out to future multi-omics analysis to study a phenotype in a holistic manner. The pipeline source code, detailed documentation and automated version as a R package are accessible. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our pipeline, we applied it to a drug screening task. We integrated multi-omics data to find the lowest level of statistical associations between data features in two case studies. Strongly correlated features within each of these two datasets were used for drug-target analysis, resulting in a list of 84 drug-target candidates. Further computational docking and toxicity analyses revealed seven high-confidence targets, amsacrine, bosutinib, ceritinib, crizotinib, nintedanib and sunitinib as potential starting points for drug therapy and development.","Chen, Tyrone; Philip, Melcy; Lê Cao, Kim-Anh; Tyagi, Sonika",Brief. bioinform,279,20

Reportage of COVID-related death and bereavement illuminates public perceptions of, and responses to, the COVID-19 pandemic. AIM: We aimed to explore British newspaper representations of 'saying goodbye' before and after a COVID-related death and consider clinical implications. DESIGN: Document analysis of UK online newspaper articles published during 2 week-long periods in March-April 2020. DATA SOURCES: The seven most-read online newspapers were searched: The Guardian, The Daily Mail, The Telegraph, The Mirror, The Sun, The Times and The Metro. Fifty-five articles discussed bereavement after a human death from COVID-19, published during 18/03-24/03/2020 (the UK's transition into lockdown) or 08/04-14/04/2020 (the UK peak of the pandemic's first wave). RESULTS: The act of 'saying goodbye' (before, during and after death) was central to media representations of COVID bereavement, represented as inherently important and profoundly disrupted. Bedside access was portrayed as restricted, variable and uncertain, with families begging or bargaining for contact. Video-link goodbyes were described with ambivalence. Patients were portrayed as 'dying alone' regardless of clinician presence. Funerals were portrayed as travesties and grieving alone as unnatural. Articles focused on what was forbidden and offered little practical guidance. CONCLUSION: Newspapers portrayed COVID-19 as disruptive to rituals of 'saying goodbye' before, during and after death. Adaptations were presented as insufficient attempts to ameliorate tragic situations. More nuanced and supportive reporting is recommended. Clinicians and other professionals supporting the bereaved can play an important role in offering alternative narratives.","Selman, Lucy E; Sowden, Ryann; Borgstrom, Erica",Palliat Med,279,20

Reportage of COVID-related death and bereavement illuminates public perceptions of, and responses to, the COVID-19 pandemic. AIM: We aimed to explore British newspaper representations of 'saying goodbye' before and after a COVID-related death and consider clinical implications. DESIGN: Document analysis of UK online newspaper articles published during 2 week-long periods in March-April 2020. DATA SOURCES: The seven most-read online newspapers were searched: The Guardian, The Daily Mail, The Telegraph, The Mirror, The Sun, The Times and The Metro.

The severity of the infection may be visible as pneumonia, acute respiratory syndrome, and even death. Until the outbreak of SARS, this group of viruses was greatly overlooked. However, since the SARS and MERS outbreaks, these viruses have been studied in greater detail, propelling the vaccine research. On December 31, 2019, mysterious cases of pneumonia were detected in the city of Wuhan in China's Hubei Province. On January 7, 2020, the causative agent was identified as a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV), and the disease was later named as COVID-19 by the WHO. The virus spread extensively in the Wuhan region of China and has gained entry to over 210 countries and territories. Though experts suspected that the virus is transmitted from animals to humans, there are mixed reports on the origin of the virus. There are no treatment options available for the virus as such, limited to the use of anti-HIV drugs and/or other antivirals such as Remdesivir and Galidesivir. For the containment of the virus, it is recommended to quarantine the infected and to follow good hygiene practices. The virus has had a significant socio-economic impact globally. Economically, China is likely to experience a greater setback than other countries from the pandemic due to added trade war pressure, which have been discussed in this paper.","Keni, Raghuvir; Alexander, Anila; Nayak, Pawan Ganesh; Mudgal, Jayesh; Nandakumar, Krishnadas",Front Public Health,279,24

However, the underlying pathomechanisms are largely undefined. Here, we sought to identify the potential molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 mediated coagulopathy and thromboembolism. A broader investigation was conducted including hospitalized COVID-19 patients with (severe cases that required intensive care) or without pneumonia (moderate cases). Phenotypic and molecular characterizations were performed employing basic coagulation tests, flow cytometry-based multiplex assays, and ELISA. The investigations revealed induction of plasma P-selectin and CD40 ligand (sCD40L) in moderate COVID-19 cases which were significantly abolished with the progression of COVID-19 severity. Moreover, a profound reduction in plasma tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) and FXIII were identified particularly in the severe COVID-19. Further analysis revealed a profound induction of fibrinogen in both moderate and severe patients. Interestingly, an elevated plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 more prominently in moderate, and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) particularly in severe COVID-19 cases were observed. Particularly, the levels of fibrinogen and tPA directly correlated with the severity of COVID-19. In summary, SARS-CoV-2 infection induces the levels of platelet activation markers soluble P-selectin and sCD40L in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, an attenuated level of TFPI indicates TF pathway activation and, acquired FXIII deficiency likely plays a key role in thrombus instability and promotes thromboembolism in severe cases. The progression of COVID-19 severity could be limited with anti-platelet in combination with recombinantTFPI treatment. Furthermore, thromboembolic events in severe COVID-19 patients could be minimized if treated with recombinantFXIII in combination with LMW heparin.","Al-Tamimi, Abaher O.; Yusuf, Ayesha M.; Jayakumar, Manju N.; Ansari, Abdul W.; Elhassan, Mona; AbdulKarim, Fatema; Kannan, Meganathan; Halwani, Rabih; Ahmad, Firdos",,279,1

If the country continues to follow business-as-usual (BAU) then it is anticipated that carbon output could surge past pre-COVID-19 levels - that means more disasters in future. Thus, it is an unprecedented opportunity to shift from BAU and achieve carbon-neutral and nature-positive economic recovery - green economic recovery (GER). To fuel the GER, access to modern, equitable, affordable and sustainable energy is paramount. This study explores waste-to-energy (WtE) as an alternative green fuel for GER. Seven WtE technologies are prioritized based on the concept of energy trilemma - energy security, energy equity, and environmental sustainability. For the evaluation, an energy trilemma based decision support framework is developed using most prominent multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods. The fuzzy set theory is integrated with MCDM methods to minimize uncertainty in results. Sixteen experts are engaged to score each WtE technology with respect to every energy trilemma dimension and sub-dimension. Gasification technology is found to be the most feasible option for WtE generation in Pakistan whereas Torrefaction technology is least favorable. It is concluded that the need to shift towards sustainable energy is more than ever to limit the carbon emission and prevent future crisis.","Ali Shah, Syed Ahsan; Longsheng, Cheng; Solangi, Yasir Ahmed; Ahmed, Munir; Ali, Sharafat",J Clean Prod,279,4

METHODS: In this retrospective, single-center cohort study, we included all adult inpatients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to a neuro-COVID unit beginning February 21, 2020, who had been discharged or died by April 5, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data were extracted from medical records and compared (false discovery rate corrected) to those of neurologic patients without COVID-19 admitted in the same period. RESULTS: One hundred seventy-three patients were included in this study, of whom 56 were positive and 117 were negative for COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 were older (77.0 years, interquartile range [IQR] 67.0-83.8 years vs 70.1 years, IQR 52.9-78.6 years, p = 0.006), had a different distribution regarding admission diagnoses, including cerebrovascular disorders (n = 43, 76.8% vs n = 68, 58.1%), and had a higher quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score on admission (0.9, IQR 0.7-1.1 vs 0.5, IQR 0.4-0.6, p = 0.006). In-hospital mortality rates (n = 21, 37.5% vs n = 5, 4.3%, p < 0.001) and incident delirium (n = 15, 26.8% vs n = 9, 7.7%, p = 0.003) were significantly higher in the COVID-19 group. Patients with COVID-19 and without COVID with stroke had similar baseline characteristics, but patients with COVID-19 had higher modified Rankin Scale scores at discharge (5.0, IQR 2.0-6.0 vs 2.0, IQR 1.0-3.0, p < 0.001), with a significantly lower number of patients with a good outcome (n = 11, 25.6% vs n = 48, 70.6%, p < 0.001). In patients with COVID-19, multivariable regressions showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with higher qSOFA scores (odds ratio [OR] 4.47, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.21-16.5, p = 0.025), lower platelet count (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.97-0.99, p = 0.005), and higher lactate dehydrogenase (OR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00-1.03, p = 0.009) on admission. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 admitted with neurologic disease, including stroke, have a significantly higher in-hospital mortality and incident delirium and higher disability than patients without COVID-19.","Benussi, Alberto; Pilotto, Andrea; Premi, Enrico; Libri, Ilenia; Giunta, Marcello; Agosti, Chiara; Alberici, Antonella; Baldelli, Enrico; Benini, Matteo; Bonacina, Sonia; Brambilla, Laura; Caratozzolo, Salvatore; Cortinovis, Matteo; Costa, Angelo; Cotti Piccinelli, Stefano; Cottini, Elisabetta; Cristillo, Viviana; Delrio, Ilenia; Filosto, Massimiliano; Gamba, Massimo; Gazzina, Stefano; Gilberti, Nicola; Gipponi, Stefano; Imarisio, Alberto; Invernizzi, Paolo; Leggio, Ugo; Leonardi, Matilde; Liberini, Paolo; Locatelli, Martina; Masciocchi, Stefano; Poli, Loris; Rao, Renata; Risi, Barbara; Rozzini, Luca; Scalvini, Andrea; Schiano di Cola, Francesca; Spezi, Raffaella; Vergani, Veronica; Volonghi, Irene; Zoppi, Nicola; Borroni, Barbara; Magoni, Mauro; Pezzini, Alessandro; Padovani, Alessandro",Neurology,279,29

There are four major approaches being employed or considered presently to augment or strengthen the immune system, in order to reduce adverse effects of viral exposure. The three approaches that are focused mainly on augmenting the immune system are based on the concept that pandemics/outbreaks can be controlled/prevented while maintaining the immune-degrading lifestyles followed by much of the global population. The fourth approach is based on identifying and introducing measures aimed at strengthening the immune system intrinsically in order to minimize future pandemics/outbreaks. Specifically, the four measures are: 1) restricting exposure to virus; 2) providing reactive/tactical treatments to reduce viral load; 3) developing vaccines to prevent, or at least attenuate, the infection; 4) strengthening the immune system intrinsically, by a) identifying those factors that contribute to degrading the immune system, then eliminating/reducing them as comprehensively, thoroughly, and rapidly as possible, and b) replacing the eliminated factors with immune-strengthening factors. This paper focuses on vaccine safety. A future COVID-19 vaccine appears to be the treatment of choice at the national/international level. Vaccine development has been accelerated to achieve this goal in the relatively near-term, and questions have arisen whether vaccine safety has been/is being/will be compromised in pursuit of a shortened vaccine development time. There are myriad mechanisms related to vaccine-induced, and natural infection-induced, infections that could adversely impact vaccine effectiveness and safety. This paper summarizes many of those mechanisms.","Kostoff, Ronald N; Kanduc, Darja; Porter, Alan L; Shoenfeld, Yehuda; Calina, Daniela; Briggs, Michael B; Spandidos, Demetrios A; Tsatsakis, Aristidis",,279,16

It has been reported that the UK and South African strains may have higher transmission capabilities, eventually in part due to amino acid substitutions on the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. The pathogenicity seems modified but is still under investigation. Here we used the experimental structure of the Spike RBD domain co-crystallized with part of the ACE2 receptor, several in silico methods and numerous experimental data reported recently to analyze the possible impacts of three amino acid replacements (Spike K417N, E484K, N501Y) with regard to ACE2 binding. We found that the N501Y replacement in this region of the interface (present in both the UK and South African strains) should be favorable for the interaction with ACE2, while the K417N and E484K substitutions (South African strain) would seem neutral or even unfavorable. It is unclear if the N501Y substitution in the South African strain could counterbalance the K417N and E484K Spike replacements with regard to ACE2 binding. Our finding suggests that the UK strain should have higher affinity toward ACE2 and therefore likely increased transmissibility and possibly pathogenicity. If indeed the South African strain has a high transmission level, this could be due to the N501Y replacement and/or to substitutions in regions located outside the direct Spike-ACE2 interface but not so much to the K417N and E484K replacements. Yet, it should be noted that amino acid changes at Spike position 484 can lead to viral escape from neutralizing antibodies. Further, these amino acid substitutions do not seem to induce major structural changes in this region of the Spike protein. This structure-function study allows us to rationalize some observations made for the UK strain but raises questions for the South African strain.","Villoutreix, Bruno O; Calvez, Vincent; Marcelin, Anne-Geneviève; Khatib, Abdel-Majid",Int. j. mol. sci.

The tragic death toll and high rates of morbidity across many countries are an unprecedented setback and a calamity for those affected physically and mentally. The economic and social effects of lockdowns, loss of production and business confidence, and global recession will cast a long shadow over education systems. Despite the 435 million items that Google already indexes under ""COVID-19 education"", many things remain unknown. No one has a clear idea of how the current pandemic will unravel over anything but the short term. The challenge is to strengthen the mechanisms to separate evidence from opinion and to balance popularism with speaking truth to power-especially when political systems can find it difficult to distinguish fact from convenient fiction.

Testing these propositions over the next year will open the door to an evidence-based approach to reconstruction and sustainable development and juxtapose immediate concerns of the present with aspirations for the future. More than ever the need is to see beyond the exigencies of COVID-19 and act to secure the educational gains of the recent past.

Adversities that are the most prominently studied and shown to bring about the most serious consequences for adjustment across the adult lifespan include job loss, disease and disability onset, and spousal and child bereavement. However, not all individuals show sustained declines to adversity; some are able to bounce back. The resilience literature is built on the premise that individuals are able to bounce back, or adapt to adversity. The past 15-20 years have seen an abundance of resilience research examining resilience to diverse types of adversity across the adult life-span. The overarching goal of this paper is to evaluate psychological concepts of resilience in adulthood and old age and recommend avenues for future research. To do so, I first evaluate and discuss definitions of resilience and their overlap across literatures with an emphasis on sociological approaches to studying adversity across the adult lifespan. Second, I discuss promising conceptual and methodological approaches to advance the resilience literature in adulthood and old age. Conceptual approaches to furthering the resilience literature include incorporating an anticipation component into the definition of resilience. Methodological approaches to furthering the resilience literature include prospective longitudinal designs that incorporate quantitative and qualitative approaches, multidimensional assessments, and the need to examine repeated adversities or multiple adversities that transpire in relatively close proximity to one another.","Infurna, Frank J",Gerontology,279,6

Coronaviruses have produced two pandemics and one epidemic in the last two decades. The current pandemic has created a worldwide catastrophe threatening the lives of over 15 million as of July 2020. Current research efforts have been focused on producing a vaccine or repurposing current drug compounds to develop a therapeutic. There is, however, a need to study the active site preferences of relevant targets, such as the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (SARS-CoV-2 Mpro), to determine ways to optimize these drug compounds. The ensemble docking and characterization work described in this article demonstrates the multifaceted features of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro active site, molecular guidelines to improving binding affinity, and ultimately the optimization of drug candidates. A total of 220 compounds were docked into both the 5R7Z and 6LU7 SARS-CoV-2 Mpro crystal structures. Several key preferences for strong binding to the four subsites (S1, S1', S2, and S4) were identified, such as accessing hydrogen binding hotspots, hydrophobic patches, and utilization of primarily aliphatic instead of aromatic substituents. After optimization efforts using the design guidelines developed from the molecular docking studies, the average docking score of the parent compounds was improved by 6.59 -log10(Kd) in binding affinity which represents an increase of greater than six orders of magnitude. Using the optimization guidelines, the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitor cinanserin was optimized resulting in an increase in binding affinity of 4.59 -log10(Kd) and increased protease inhibitor bioactivity. The results of molecular dynamic (MD) simulation of cinanserin-optimized compounds CM02, CM06, and CM07 revealed that CM02 and CM06 fit well into the active site of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro [Protein Data Bank (PDB) accession number 6LU7] and formed strong and stable interactions with the key residues, Ser-144, His-163, and Glu-166. The enhanced binding affinity produced demonstrates the utility of the design guidelines described.

METHODS: Prospective data on virus etiology of ARI hospitalizations during the peaks of 8 influenza seasons (2011-12 to 2018-19) in Quebec, Canada, was used to compare patients with HCoV to those with influenza infections; generalized estimation equations models were used for multivariate analyses. RESULTS: We identified 340 HCoV infections which affected 11.6%(n=136) of children and 5.2%(n=204) of adults hospitalized with ARI. The majority of children (75%) with HCoV infections were also coinfected with other respiratory viruses compared to 24% of the adults (p<0.0001). No deaths were recorded in children; 5.8% of adults with HCoV monoinfection compared to 4.2% of those with influenza monoinfection died (p=0.226). The risk of pneumonia was non-significantly lower in children with HCoV than with influenza but similarly high in adults. Markers of severity (length-of-stay, intensive-care admissions and case-fatality ratio) were comparable between these infections in multivariate analyses, both in children and adults. CONCLUSIONS: In children and adults hospitalized with ARI, HCoV infections were less frequent than influenza infections, but HCoV monoinfections were as severe as influenza monoinfections.","Gilca, Rodica; Carazo, Sara; Amini, Rachid; Charest, Hugues; De Serres, Gaston",J. infect. dis,279,21

While this class of insecticides are effective on a wide range of insect pests, the toxicities of diamide insecticides vary among species and life stages. In this study, we addressed the mechanism underlying the different responses of Plutella xylostella and Pieris rapae to diamide insecticides. The susceptibility to insecticides of P. xylostella and P. rapae larvae was assessed 2 and 4 days after exposure to chlorantraniliprole, cyantraniliprole, and tetrachlorantraniliprole. P. xylostella larvae treated with distilled water (Group A), chlorantraniliprole (Group B), cyantraniliprole (Group C), and tetrachlorantraniliprole (Group D) and P. rapae larvae treated with distilled water (Group E), chlorantraniliprole (Group F), cyantraniliprole (Group G) and tetrachlorantraniliprole (Group H) were subjected to metabolomics analysis.

Chlorantraniliprole, cyantraniliprole, and tetrachlorantraniliprole all showed high toxicities for P. xylostella and P. rapae larvae. P. rapae larvae were more sensitive to the diamide insecticides than P. xylostella larvae. There were 65 overlapped differential metabolites between P. xylostella and P. rapae larvae treated with these three diamide insecticides. Pathway analysis showed that the differential metabolites were closely related with fatty acid biosynthesis and metabolism-related pathways.

We assessed family disruption and family functioning with measures of key family-level and parenting dimensions, including family cohesion, conflict and routines, and parents' harsh discipline, lax discipline and warmth. In all models, pre-pandemic parent emotional distress, financial strain and child maladjustment were included as covariates. METHODS: The sample included 204 families, comprised of parents who had children (MAge = 4.17; 45.1% girls). Parents (MAge = 27.43) completed the first survey prior to COVID-19 onset in the United States, a second survey after COVID-19 onset in May 2020 and a third survey two weeks later. RESULTS: Analyses were conducted in a model-building fashion, first computing structural equation models for each family and parenting dimension separately, then advancing significant dimensions into one integrated model for the family-level factors and a second model for parenting quality factors. Results provided more support for the family disruption hypothesis across all tests. In the family-level domain, decreases in family cohesion and increases in family conflict each uniquely predicted subsequent child maladjustment. In the parenting domain, increases in harsh discipline and lax discipline each uniquely predicted subsequent child maladjustment. Family routines and parental warmth were not associated with child adjustment. However, parents' emotional distress prior to the pandemic exhibited a robust association with children's internalizing problems.

Immunocompromised individuals are highly susceptible to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Whether vaccine-induced immunity in these individuals involves the oral cavity, a primary site of infection, is presently unknown. Methods. Immunocompromised individuals (n=404) and healthy controls (n=82) participated in a prospective clinical trial encompassing two doses of the mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine. Immunocompromised individuals included primary immunodeficiencies (PID) and secondary immunodeficiencies caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)/chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy (CAR-T), solid organ transplantation (SOT), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Saliva and serum samples were collected at four time points from the first vaccine dose until 2 weeks after second dose. SARS-CoV-2 spike specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) responses were quantified by a multiplex bead-based assay in saliva and correlated to paired serum IgG titers determined by Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S assay. Results. IgG responses to the SARS-CoV-2 spike full-length trimeric glycoprotein (Spike-f) and S1 subunit in saliva in the HIV and HSCT/CAR-T groups were comparable to healthy controls. In contrast, PID, SOT, and CLL patients all displayed weaker responses which were mainly influenced by disease parameters or immunosuppressants. Salivary IgG levels strongly correlated with serum IgG titers on days 21 and 35 (rho=0.8079 and 0.7768, p=<0.0001). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis for the predictive power of salivary IgG yielded AUC=0.95, PPV=90.7% for the entire cohort on D35. Conclusions. Saliva conveys humoral responses induced by BNT162b2 vaccination. The predictive power makes it highly suitable for screening low responding/vulnerable groups for revaccination.","Healy, Katie; Pin, Elisa; Chen, Puran; Soderdahl, Gunnar; Nowak, Piotr; Mielke, Stephan; Hansson, Lotta; Bergman, Peter; Smith, Edvard; Ljungman, Per; Valentini, Davide; Blennow, Ola; Osterborg, Anders; Gabarrini, Giorgio; Almanei, Khaled; Alkharaan, Hassan; Sobkowiak, Michal; Xu, Xinling; Akbar, Mira; Lore, Karin; Hellstrom, Cecilia; Muschiol, Sandra; Bogdanovic, Gordana; Buggert, Marcus; Ljunggren, Hans-Gustaf; Hober, Sophia; Nilsson, Peter; Chen, Margaret Sallberg",,279,16

Internet search volumes are useful data that can sensitively detect trends of the public's attention during a pandemic outbreak situation. OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to analyze the public's interest in COVID-19 proliferation, identify the correlation between the proliferation of COVID-19 and interest in immunity and products that have been reported to confer an enhancement of immunity, and suggest measures for interventions that should be implemented from a health and medical point of view. METHODS: To assess the level of public interest in infectious diseases during the initial days of the COVID-19 outbreak, we extracted Google search data from January 20, 2020, onward and compared them to data from March 15, 2020, which was approximately 2 months after the COVID-19 outbreak began. In order to determine whether the public became interested in the immune system, we selected coronavirus, immune, and vitamin as our final search terms. RESULTS: The increase in the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases that occurred after January 20, 2020, had a strong positive correlation with the search volumes for the terms coronavirus (R=0.786; P<.001), immune (R=0.745; P<.001), and vitamin (R=0.778; P<.001), and the correlations between variables were all mutually statistically significant. Moreover, these correlations were confirmed on a country basis when we restricted our analyses to the United States, the United Kingdom, Italy, and Korea. Our findings revealed that increases in search volumes for the terms coronavirus and immune preceded the actual occurrences of confirmed cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that during the initial phase of the COVID-19 crisis, the public's desire and actions of strengthening their own immune systems were enhanced. Further, in the early stage of a pandemic, social media platforms have a high potential for informing the public about potentially helpful measures to prevent the spread of an infectious disease and provide relevant information about immunity, thereby increasing the public's knowledge.","Lee, Jinhee; Kwan, Yunna; Lee, Jun Young; Shin, Jae Il; Lee, Keum Hwa; Hong, Sung Hwi; Han, Young Joo; Kronbichler, Andreas; Smith, Lee; Koyanagi, Ai; Jacob, Louis; Choi, SungWon; Ghayda, Ramy Abou; Park, Myung-Bae",J Med Internet Res,279,1

The present study sought to determine knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP) of health care workers (HCWs) toward COVID-19 in Makerere University Teaching Hospitals (MUTHs) in Uganda. Methods: An online cross sectional, descriptive study was undertaken through WhatsApp Messenger among HCWs in four MUTHs. HCWs aged 18 years and above constituted the study population. KAP toward COVID-19 was assessed by using a pre-validated questionnaire. Bloom's cut-off of 80% was used to determine sufficient knowledge (≥80%), positive attitude (≥4), and good practice (≥2.4). All analyses were performed using STATA 15.1 and GraphPad Prism 8.3. Results: Of the 581 HCWs approached, 136 (23%) responded. A vast majority of the participants were male (n = 87, n = 64%), with a median age of 32 (range: 20–66) years. Eighty-four (62%) were medical doctors and 125 (92%) had at least a bachelor's degree. Overall, 69% (n = 94) had sufficient knowledge, 21% (n = 29) had positive attitude, and 74% (n = 101) had good practices toward COVID-19. Factors associated with knowledge were age &gt;40 years (aOR: 0.3; 95% CI: 0.1–1.0; p = 0.047) and news media (aOR: 4.8; 95% CI: 1.4–17.0; p = 0.015). Factors associated with good practices were age 40 years or more (aOR: 48.4; 95% CI: 3.1–742.9; p = 0.005) and holding a diploma (aOR: 18.4; 95% CI: 1–322.9; p = 0.046). Conclusions: Continued professional education is advised among HCWs in Uganda to improve knowledge of HCWs hence averting negative attitudes and promoting positive preventive and therapeutic practices.

Clinical presentation can range from asymptomatic to severe illness and mortality. Thrombotic complications in COVID-19 have been associated with mortality. The incidence of systemic hypercoagulation in COVID-19 is associated with the process of severe inflammation. The majority of severely ill patients have developed coagulopathy, and this condition is associated with poor outcomes. CASE REPORT A 72-year-old man presented with respiratory symptoms and was diagnosed with a COVID-19 infection. He presented with tachypnea, tachycardia, increased blood pressure, and 74% peripheral oxygen saturation under 15 L/min oxygen per non-rebreather mask. Initial laboratory test results showed severe hypoxemia as per blood gas analysis (pH 7.42, pCO2 23 mmHg, pO2 43 mmHg, HCO3 15 mmol/L, base deficit -9 mmol/L), with increased procalcitonin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, D-dimer, fibrinogen, creatine kinase myocardial band, and Troponin I. He subsequently developed thrombosis of the pulmonary arteries and multiple branches of the pulmonary vein despite therapeutic anticoagulation. We initiated heparin therapy (average dose 25 191 units per day, mean activated partial thromboplastin time, 64.35 seconds). Radiological investigations revealed multiple thromboses on pulmonary arteries and pulmonary veins, as well as multiple locations of brain infarction. Rescue thrombolytic therapy was given, but unfortunately, the patient died due to multiple end-organ failures. CONCLUSIONS Controlling coagulopathy, and thrombolytic therapy type and timing, are critical issues, and new strategies must be sought to lower its morbidity and mortality rates further.","Aribawa, I Gusti Ngurah M; Hidayat, Leonard; Dewi, Putu Utami; Ryalino, Christopher",Am J Case Rep,279,16

This reveals a need for more attention to political aspects of health outcome inequities. As advocates for health equity, nurses can join in recent scholarship and activism concerning the political determinants of health. In this paper, we examine recent work on the political determinants of health with an aim to add two things. First, we seek to build further on the notion of ""political"" determinants of health by distinguishing policy and governance structures from dynamics of politicization through appeal to critical disabilities studies. Second, we seek to apply this further nuanced approach to challenge rhetorical uses of ""vulnerable populations,"" where this phrase serves to misrecognize systemic institutionalized forces that actively exploit and marginalize people and groups. By refocusing attention to political systems organized around and perpetuating inequitable health outcomes, nurses and other health care professionals-as well as those whom they serve-can concentrate their effort and power to act on political determinants of health in bringing about more equitable health outcomes.","Dickman, Nathan Eric; Chicas, Roxana",Nurs Inq,279,16

Bivariable and multivariable regression was held to determine significant predictors for preparedness. For all statistical analyses, a p value â©½ 0.05 was considered as significant. Results: From a total health professionals, 301 health professionals with a response rate of 86% participated in the study. Among these, 206 were males while 95 participants were females with a mean age of 29.71 ± 5.84 years. To determine the preparedness level, we use the mean preparedness score of the respondents. Around 64.1% of health professionals were well prepared. Among 20 respondents who had a chronic illness, 80% of them think their illness is risky for the pandemic. The majority of the respondents (229/76.1%) responded as they were working without protective equipment.

In addition to identifying the vibrational signatures of adsorbed DBP, TERS reveals subtle ripples and compressive strains of the borophene lattice underneath the molecular layer. The induced interfacial strain is demonstrated to extend in borophene by â¼1 nm beyond the molecular region by virtue of 5 Å chemical spatial resolution. Molecular manipulation experiments prove the molecular origins of interfacial strain in addition to allowing atomic control of local strain with magnitudes as small as â¼0.6%. In addition to being the first realization of an organic/borophene vertical heterostructure, this study demonstrates that UHV-TERS is a powerful analytical tool to spectroscopically investigate buried and highly localized interfacial characteristics at the atomic scale, which can be applied to additional classes of heterostructured materials.","Li, Linfei; Schultz, Jeremy F; Mahapatra, Sayantan; Liu, Xiaolong; Shaw, Chasen; Zhang, Xu; Hersam, Mark C; Jiang, Nan",j. am. chem. soc,279,16

A multitude of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detection assays with disparate gene targets, including automated high-throughput platforms, are available. Varying concordance and interpretation of diagnostic results in this setting can result in significant reporting delays, leading to suboptimal disease management. This article reports the development of a novel ORF1a-based SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay - Viroselect - that shows high concordance with conventional assays and the ability to resolve inconclusive results generated during the peak of the epidemic in Mumbai, India. METHODS: A unique target region within SARS-CoV-2 ORF1a - the non-structural protein 3 (nsp3) region - was used to design and develop the assay. This hypervariable region (1923-3956) between SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus was utilized to design the primers and probes for the RT-PCR assay. The concordance of this assay with commonly used emergency use authorization (US Food and Drug Administration) manual kits and an automated high-throughput testing platform was evaluated. Further, a retrospective analysis was carried out using Viroselect on samples reported as 'inconclusive' between April and October 2020. RESULTS: In total, 701 samples were tested. Concordance analysis of 477 samples demonstrated high overall agreement of Viroselect with both manual (87.6%) and automated (84.7%) assays. Also, in the retrospective analysis of 224 additional samples reported as 'inconclusive', Viroselect was able to resolve 100% (19/19) and 93.7% (192/205) of samples which had inconclusive results on manual and automated high-throughput platforms, respectively. CONCLUSION: Viroselect had high concordance with conventional assays, both manual and automated, and has potential to resolve inconclusive samples.","Jawade, Ketki; Sinha, Akhauri Yash; Bhagat, Sharad; Bhowmick, Shilpa; Chauhan, Bhagyashree; Kaginkar, Snehal; Palav, Harsha; Kasarpalkar, Nandini; Devadiga, Pratik; Karandikar, Kalyani; Agrawal, Sachee; Shastri, Jayanthi; Munne, Kiran; Bhor, Vikrant M; Mahale, Smita D; Bhowmik, Subhanjan; Jagtap, Dhanashree; Patel, Vainav",Int J Infect Dis,279,16

This study aims to analyse the incidence of DIC in COVID-19 non-survivors and to assess the association between DIC and its comorbidities. Methods: The medical records of 154 non-survivors of COVID-19, hospitalised between April 2020 and July 2020, were retrospectively analysed. The International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) criteria for DIC were applied to identify the occurrence of coagulopathy. The receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to assess the association between DIC and its comorbidities. Results: Out of 154 non-survivors, non-overt DIC was observed in 94.8% of the patients, whereas only 5.2% fulfilled the overt criteria of DIC with a mean age 64.6 years. The mortality rate was 4.5 times higher among men than women. The D-dimer level was >250 ng/ml in 68.8% of the patients including 88.9% of the non-overt and 100% of the overt DIC patients. Prothrombin time (PT) in non-overt and overt DIC cases was 17.3 s and 24.4 s, respectively. Thrombotic event and chronic kidney disease were found to be the main predictors of DIC (p < 0.0001 and 0.03, respectively) followed by diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (statistically insignificant). Conclusions: Our study concludes that the ISTH DIC score cannot predict mortality as the COVID-19 related DIC differs from the sepsis-induced DIC. Among the seriously ill, older patients with comorbidities, increased levels of D-dimer and prolonged PT are more reliable parameters among COVID-19 non-survivors.","Anwar, Nimra; Tashfeen, Sunila; Akhtar, Fahim; Noor, Afshan; Khan, Saleem Ahmed; Omair, Ahmad",,279,18

The overall summaries at coarser spatial scales, that are obtained by simply averaging individual curves (across regions), hide nuanced variability and blur the spatial heterogeneity at finer spatial scales. For instance, a decreasing incidence rate curve in one region is obscured by an increasing rate curve for another region, when the analysis relies on coarse averages of locally heterogeneous transmission dynamics. Objective : To highlight regional differences in COVID-19 incidence rates and to discover prominent patterns in shapes of incidence rate curves in multiple regions (USA and Europe). Methods : We employ statistical methods to analyze shapes of local COVID-19 incidence rate curves and statistically group them into distinct clusters, according to their shapes. Using this information, we derive the so-called shape averages of curves within these clusters, which represent the dominant incidence patterns of these clusters. We apply this methodology to the analysis of the daily incidence trajectory of the COVID-pandemic for two geographic areas: A state-level analysis within the USA and a country-level analysis within Europe during late-February to October 1 st , 2020. Results : Our analyses reveal that pandemic curves often differ substantially across regions. However, there are only a handful of shapes that dominate transmission dynamics for all states in the USA and countries in Europe. This approach yields a broad classification of spatial areas into different characteristic epidemic trajectories. In particular, spatial areas within the same cluster have followed similar transmission and control dynamics. Conclusion : The shape-based analysis of pandemic curves presented here helps divide country or continental data into multiple regional clusters, each cluster containing areas with similar trend patterns. This clustering helps highlight differences in pandemic curves across regions and provides summaries that better reflect dynamical patterns within the clusters. This approach adds to the methodological toolkit for public health practitioners to facilitate decision making at different spatial scales.","Srivast, A.; Chowell, G.",,279,20

The purported development of a vaccine could require at least 1-4 years, while the typical timeline from hit finding to drug registration of an antiviral is >10 years. Thus, repositioning of known drugs can significantly accelerate the development and deployment of therapies for COVID-19. To identify therapeutics that can be repurposed as SARS-CoV-2 antivirals, we developed and initiated a high-throughput cell-based screen that incorporates the essential viral papain-like protease (PLpro) and its peptide cleavage site into a luciferase complementation assay to evaluate the efficacy of known drugs encompassing approximately 15,000 clinical-stage or US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved small molecules.

Protecting those at high risk of infection/transmission, whilst addressing the multiple health and social needs of this group, is of utmost importance. The aim of this novel qualitative study was to document how one service in Scotland, the Wellbeing Centre run by The Salvation Army, adapted in response. METHODS: Care was taken to identify methods that did not create additional stress at this pressured time. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with Centre clients (n = 10, in-person and telephone) and staff (n = 5, telephone), and external professionals (n = 5, telephone), during April-August 2020. These were audio-recorded, fully transcribed, and analysed using Framework. Service documents were used to enhance contextual understanding. Analysis was informed by theories of psychologically informed environments and enabling environments. RESULTS: The start of the pandemic was a time of confusion, disruption, and isolation. Centre staff rapidly adapted methods of engagement to provide a range of comprehensive physical and emotional supports, to both existing and new clients, through telephone and online communication and, eventually, socially distanced in-person support. This involved balancing the risks of COVID-19 infection/transmission with the benefits of continuity of support to those highly vulnerable to a range of harms. Whilst the pandemic created many challenges, it also facilitated removal of barriers, particularly concerning provision of harm reduction services which had previously been severely constrained. Clients described the Centre as a 'lifeline', providing stability and safety during a period of profound disruption when other services closed their doors. Strong leadership, intensive team working, support/training for staff, a focus on relationships, and active use of client feedback, enabled responsive adaptation to fast-changing demands and the creation of a 'culture of care'. CONCLUSION: This study provides a unique insight into the pandemic by analysing the response of one homeless service during the height of the pandemic. We present a range of implications that have international relevance for those designing policies, and adapting front-line services, to proactively respond to COVID-19 and the continued public health crises of homelessness and drug-related deaths.","Parkes, Tessa; Carver, Hannah; Masterton, Wendy; Falzon, Danilo; Dumbrell, Josh; Grant, Susan; Wilson, Iain",Harm Reduct J,279,16

In this commentary, we detail the pandemic response strategies of the Morehouse School of Medicine Prevention Research Center. We discuss the implications of these complex factors and propose recommendations for addressing them that, adopted together, will result in community and data-informed mitigation strategies. These approaches will proactively prepare for the next pandemic and advance community leadership toward health equity.","Henry Akintobi, Tabia; Jacobs, Theresa; Sabbs, Darrell; Holden, Kisha; Braithwaite, Ronald; Johnson, L Neicey; Dawes, Daniel; Hoffman, LaShawn",Prev Chronic Dis,279,16

Up until now, there has been no comprehensive investigation as to the adverse health effects masks can cause. The aim was to find, test, evaluate and compile scientifically proven related side effects of wearing masks. For a quantitative evaluation, 44 mostly experimental studies were referenced, and for a substantive evaluation, 65 publications were found. The literature revealed relevant adverse effects of masks in numerous disciplines. In this paper, we refer to the psychological and physical deterioration as well as multiple symptoms described because of their consistent, recurrent and uniform presentation from different disciplines as a Mask-Induced Exhaustion Syndrome (MIES). We objectified evaluation evidenced changes in respiratory physiology of mask wearers with significant correlation of O2 drop and fatigue (p < 0.05), a clustered co-occurrence of respiratory impairment and O2 drop (67%), N95 mask and CO2 rise (82%), N95 mask and O2 drop (72%), N95 mask and headache (60%), respiratory impairment and temperature rise (88%), but also temperature rise and moisture (100%) under the masks.

This population is also at risk from SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is important to understand the impact of coexistent hip fracture and SARS-CoV-2 for informed decision-making at patient and service levels. METHODS: We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies of older (> 60 years) people with fragility hip fractures and outcomes with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary outcome was early (30-day or in-hospital) mortality. Secondary outcomes included length of hospital stay and key clinical characteristics known to be associated with outcomes after hip fracture. RESULTS: A total of 14 cohort and five case series studies were included (692 SARS-CoV-2 positive, 2,585 SARS-CoV-2 negative). SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with an overall risk ratio (RR) for early mortality of 4.42 (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.42 to 5.82). Early mortality was 34% (95% CI 30% to 38%) and 9% (95% CI 8% to 10%) in the infected and noninfected groups respectively. Length of stay was increased in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients (mean difference (MD) 5.2 days (3.2 to 7.2)). Age (MD 1.6 years (0.3 to 2.9)); female sex (RR 0.83 (95% CI 0.65 to 1.05)); admission from home (RR 0.51 (95% CI 0.26 to 1.00)); presence of dementia (RR 1.13 (95% CI 0.94 to 1.43)); and intracapsular fracture (RR 0.89 (95% CI 0.71 to 1.11)) were not associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. There were statistically, but not clinically, significantly greater Nottingham Hip Fracture Scores in infected compared with non-infected patients (MD 0.7 (0.4 to 0.9)). CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with worse outcomes after hip fracture. This is not explained by differences in patient characteristics. These data can be used to support informed decision-making and may help track the impact of widespread adoption of system-level and therapeutic changes in management of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Objective: To evaluate baseline QTc interval on 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) and ensuing changes among patients with and without COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study included 3050 patients aged 18 years and older who underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing and had ECGs at Columbia University Irving Medical Center from March 1 through May 1, 2020. Patients were analyzed by treatment group over 5 days, as follows: hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine alone, azithromycin alone, and neither hydroxychloroquine nor azithromycin. ECGs were manually analyzed by electrophysiologists masked to COVID-19 status. Multivariable modeling evaluated clinical associations with QTc prolongation from baseline. Exposures: COVID-19, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin. Main Outcomes and Measures: Mean QTc prolongation, percentage of patients with QTc of 500 milliseconds or greater. Results: A total of 965 patients had more than 2 ECGs and were included in the study, with 561 (58.1%) men, 198 (26.2%) Black patients, and 191 (19.8%) aged 80 years and older. There were 733 patients (76.0%) with COVID-19 and 232 patients (24.0%) without COVID-19. COVID-19 infection was associated with significant mean QTc prolongation from baseline by both 5-day and 2-day multivariable models (5-day, patients with COVID-19: 20.81 [95% CI, 15.29 to 26.33] milliseconds; P < .001; patients without COVID-19: -2.01 [95% CI, -17.31 to 21.32] milliseconds; P = .93; 2-day, patients with COVID-19: 17.40 [95% CI, 12.65 to 22.16] milliseconds; P < .001; patients without COVID-19: 0.11 [95% CI, -12.60 to 12.81] milliseconds; P = .99). COVID-19 infection was independently associated with a modeled mean 27.32 (95% CI, 4.63-43.21) millisecond increase in QTc at 5 days compared with COVID-19-negative status (mean QTc, with COVID-19: 450.45 [95% CI, 441.6 to 459.3] milliseconds; without COVID-19: 423.13 [95% CI, 403.25 to 443.01] milliseconds; P = .01). More patients with COVID-19 not receiving hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin had QTc of 500 milliseconds or greater compared with patients without COVID-19 (34 of 136 [25.0%] vs 17 of 158 [10.8%], P = .002). Multivariable analysis revealed that age 80 years and older compared with those younger than 50 years (mean difference in QTc, 11.91 [SE, 4.69; 95% CI, 2.73 to 21.09]; P = .01), severe chronic kidney disease compared with no chronic kidney disease (mean difference in QTc, 12.20 [SE, 5.26; 95% CI, 1.89 to 22.51; P = .02]), elevated high-sensitivity troponin levels (mean difference in QTc, 5.05 [SE, 1.19; 95% CI, 2.72 to 7.38]; P < .001), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels (mean difference in QTc, 5.31 [SE, 2.68; 95% CI, 0.06 to 10.57]; P = .04) were associated with QTc prolongation. Torsades de pointes occurred in 1 patient (0.1%) with COVID-19. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, COVID-19 infection was independently associated with significant mean QTc prolongation at days 5 and 2 of hospitalization compared with day 0.

Amid the outbreak of Coronavirus (COVID-19) in January 2020, strict policies were in place to restrict people's movement, bringing about steep reductions in pollution activities and notably lower ambient concentrations of primary pollutants. In this study, we report hourly measurements of fine particulate matter (i.e., PM2.5) and its comprehensive chemical speciation, including elemental and molecular source tracers, at an urban site in Shanghai spanning a period before the lockdown restriction (BR) (1 to 23 Jan. 2020) and during the restriction (DR) (24 Jan. to 9 Feb. 2020). The overall PM2.5 was reduced by 27% from 56.2 ± 40.9 (BR) to 41.1 ± 25.3 µg m-3 (DR) and the organic carbon (OC) in PM2.5 was similar, averaged at 5.45 ± 2.37 (BR) and 5.42 ± 1.75 µgC m-3 (DR). Reduction in nitrate was prominent, from 18.1 (BR) to 9.2 µg m-3 (DR), accounting for most of the PM2.5 decrease. Source analysis of PM2.5 using positive matrix factorization modeling of comprehensive chemical composition, resolved nine primary source factors and five secondary source factors. The quantitative source analysis confirms reduced contributions from primary sources affected by COVID-19, with vehicular emissions showing the largest drop, from 4.6 (BR) to 0.61 µg m-3 (DR) and the percentage change (-87%) in par with vehicle traffic volume and fuel sale statistics (-60% to -90%). In the same time period, secondary sources are revealed to vary in response to precursor reductions from the lockdown, with two sources showing consistent enhancement while the other three showing reductions, highlighting the complexity in secondary organic aerosol formation and the nonlinear response to broad primary precursor pollutants. The combined contribution from the two secondary sources to PM2.5 increased from 7.3 ± 6.6 (BR) to 14.8 ± 9.3 µg m-3 (DR), partially offsetting the reductions from primary sources and nitrate while their increased contribution to OC, from 1.6 ± 1.4 (BR) to 3.2 ± 2.0 µgC m-3 (DR), almost offset the decrease coming from the primary sources. Results from this work underscore challenges in predicting the benefits to PM2.5 improvement from emission reductions of common urban primary sources.","Zhu, Shuhui; Wang, Qiongqiong; Qiao, Liping; Zhou, Min; Wang, Shan; Lou, Shengrong; Huang, Dandan; Wang, Qian; Jing, Shengao; Wang, Hongli; Chen, Changhong; Huang, Cheng; Yu, Jian Zhen",Faraday discuss,279,5

METHODS: We reviewed patient files scheduled for an outpatient visit between January 1, 2020 and May 11th, 2020 to assess the proportion of patients in whom RM activation was possible without office visit, and compared them to those scheduled for visit before the lockdown. RESULTS: During COVID-19 pandemic, RM activation was feasible in a minority of patients (7.8% of patients) expected at outpatient clinic for a follow-up visit and device check-up. This was possible in a good proportion of complex implantable devices such as cardiac resynchronization therapy and implantable cardioverter defibrillator but only in 3 patients with a pacemaker the RM function could be activated during the period of restricted access to hospital.

The levels of these markers between NPC and inflammation cases and between tumor nests and stroma were compared. Correlations among these markers were analyzed. RESULTS: We found EBER1(+) cases in 90% of NPC patients, including 10% EBV/HPV co-infection. M1 macrophages mainly infiltrated the tumor nest, while M2 macrophages infiltrated the tumor stroma. We found a significant positive correlation between EBER1 levels and MIF levels in tumor nests and a significant positive correlation between HPV16/18 and CD11c(+) cell levels in NPC tissues. CONCLUSIONS: It is suggested that MIF is associated with EBV, and M1 macrophage infiltration is affected by HPV status in NPC.","Feng, Guofei; Xu, Yifei; Ma, Ning; Midorikawa, Kaoru; Oikawa, Shinji; Kobayashi, Hatasu; Nakamura, Satoshi; Ishinaga, Hajime; Zhang, Zhe; Huang, Guangwu; Takeuchi, Kazuhiko; Murata, Mariko",BMC Cancer,279,20

To achieve sustainable gains in the long term, switching the vaccination from one target group to a more diverse portfolio should be planned appropriately. We lay out a general mathematical framework for comparing alternative vaccination roll-out strategies for the year to come: single focus groups: (i-a) the high-risk older age groups and (i-b) the core-sociable groups;and two focus groups: (ii-a) mixed vaccination of both the high-risk and core-sociable groups simultaneously and (ii-b) cyclic vaccination switching between groups. Featuring analyses of all relevant data including age pyramids for 15 representative countries with diverse social mixing patterns shows that mixed strategies that result in both direct and indirect protection of high-risk groups may be better for the overall societal health impact of COVID-19 vaccine roll-out. Of note, over time switching the priority from high-risk older age groups to core-sociable groups responsible for heightened circulation and thus indirect risk may be increasingly advantageous.","Li, Ruiyun Bjørnstad Ottar N.; Stenseth, Nils Chr",Royal Society Open Science,279,10

Percutaneous tracheostomy is a well-known technique utilised as a strategy to wean critically ill patients from mechanical ventilation. Worldwide differences exist in terms of methods, operators, and settings, and questions remain regarding timing and indications. If tracheostomy is to be performed in COVID-19 patients, a safe environment is needed for optimal care. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We present a guidewire dilating forceps tracheostomy procedure in COVID-19 patients that was optimised including apnoea-moments, protective clothing, checklists, and clear protocols. We performed a retrospective analysis of the outcome after tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients between March 2020 and May 2020. RESULTS: The follow-up of the first 16 patients, median age 62 years, revealed a median intubation time until tracheostomy of 18 days and median cannulation time of 20 days. The overall perioperative complication rate and complication rate while cannulated was 19%, mainly superficial bleeding. None of the healthcare providers involved in performing the procedure developed any symptoms of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: This COVID-19-centred strategy based on flexibility, preparation, and cooperation between healthcare providers with different backgrounds facilitated percutaneous tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients without an increase in the overall complication rate or evidence of risk to healthcare providers. Our findings provide initial evidence that tracheostomy can be performed safely as a standard of care for COVID-19 patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation as was standard practice in ICU patients prior to the COVID-19 pandemic to promote ventilator weaning and patient recovery.","Jonckheere, Wim; Mekeirele, Michaël; Hendrickx, Steven; Jonckheer, Joop; Diltoer, Marc; Ghijselings, Idris; Raes, Matthias; Vanhonacker, Domien; Malbrain, Manu L G; Foulon, Ina; Gordts, Frans; Jacobs-Tulleneers-Thevissen, Daniel; La Meir, Mark; Nijs, Jan; Smets, Dirk; Schoneveld, Martijn; Van Eetvelde, Ellen; Vanhoeij, Marian; Verbruggen, Katia; Verfaillie, Guy; Wischmeyer, Paul; De Waele, Elisabeth",Anaesthesiol Intensive Ther,279,19

Asthma is a complex persistent inflammatory disorder of the airways characterized by reversible airflow obstruction and, from a long-term perspective, airway remodeling. Overall, mechanistic studies summarized here indicate the importance of different subtypes of EVs and their variable cargoes in the functioning of the pathways underlying asthma, and show some interesting potential for the development of future therapeutic interventions.

The FDA-approved injectable vitamin D analog, paricalcitol, suppresses stellate cell-derived murine hepatic and pancreatic pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic changes. Therefore, we suggest a possible parallel program in the pulmonary stellate cells of COVID-19 patients and propose repurposing paricalcitol infusion therapy to restrain the COVID-19 cytokine storm.

Historically, the lack of red giants in the Galactic center was discovered via the drop in the strength of the CO absorption bandhead by Kris Sellgren et al. (1990), later followed by the stellar number counts based on the high angular resolution near-infrared observations. Several mechanisms were put forward that could have led to the preferential depletion of bright red giants: star-star collisions, tidal stripping, star-accretion disc collisions, or an infall of a massive cluster or a secondary black hole. Here we propose a novel scenario for the bright red-giant depletion based on the collisions between red giants and the nuclear jet, which was likely active in the Galactic center a few million years ago and could have led to the formation of the large-scale $\gamma$-ray Fermi bubbles. The process of the jet-induced ablation of red giants appears to be most efficient within $\sim 0.04\,{\rm pc}$ (S-cluster), while at larger distances it was complemented by star-accretion disc collisions and at smaller scales, tidal stripping operated. These three mechanisms likely operated simultaneously and created an apparent core of late-type stars within $\sim 0.5\,{\rm pc}$.","Zajavcek, Michal; Araudo, Anabella; Karas, Vladim'ir; Czerny, Bo.zena; Eckart, Andreas; Sukov'a, Petra; vStolc, Marcel; Witzany, Vojtvech",,279,16

During the pandemic, interventions recommended globally for people with diabetes were to keep blood glucose on target whilst staying at home to curb the spread of the virus. In Brazil, similar measures were proposed. The aim of our observational study was to assess whether these measures achieved their objectives. METHODS: An anonymous and untraceable survey was shared from April 22nd to May 4th. States with more than 30 respondents were included in the analysis and Fisher's exact test was performed to identify associations, with p < 0.05 considered significant. RESULTS: Type 1 diabetes and female participants were prevalent, 60.76% and 76.12% respectively. 10 out of 26 states were included, in addition to the Federal District (1562 responses). Only in three states (Bahia, Goiás and Pernambuco) less than 50% of the respondents experienced higher glycemia or higher variability during the pandemic. Goiás state, where almost half of the respondents (49.12%) have private insurance, presented the highest percentage of individuals receiving medicines for three months (35.48%) and one of the lowest percentages of blood glucose deterioration (47.17%). In the large states of Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, consultations and/or lab exams were postponed by 37.14%, 34.33% and 40.88%, respectively.

Many polysaccharides, such as sulfated xylomannan, xylan, pectins, fucoidans, glucans, glucoarabinan, and arabinoxylan from Indian medicinal plants, have been shown to exhibit antiviral and immunomodulating activities. Plant polysaccharides exhibit antiviral activities through interference with the viral life cycle and inhibition of attachment of virus to host cell.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has necessitated the use of new technologies and new processes to care for hospitalized patients, including diabetes patients. The use of CGMs to automatically and remotely supplement or replace assisted monitoring of blood glucose by bedside nurses can decrease: the amount of necessary nursing exposure to COVID-19 patients with diabetes; the amount of time required for obtaining blood glucose measurements, and the amount of personal protective equipment necessary for interacting with patients during the blood glucose testing. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is now exercising enforcement discretion and not objecting to certain factory-calibrated CGMs being used in a hospital setting, both to facilitate patient care and to obtain performance data that can be used for future regulatory submissions. CGMs can be used in the hospital to decrease the frequency of fingerstick point of care capillary blood glucose testing, decrease hyperglycemic episodes, and decrease hypoglycemic episodes. Most of the research on CGMs in the hospital has focused on their accuracy and only recently outcomes data has been reported. A hospital CGM program requires cooperation of physicians, bedside nurses, diabetes educators, and hospital administrators to appropriately select and manage patients. Processes for collecting, reviewing, storing, and responding to CGM data must be established for such a program to be successful.

We profiled circular DNA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae populations sampled when young and after extensive aging. Young cells possessed highly diverse circular DNA populations but 94% of the circular DNA were lost after â¼15 divisions, whereas rDNA circles underwent massive accumulation to >95% of circular DNA. Circles present in both young and old cells were characterized by replication origins including circles from unique regions of the genome and repetitive regions: rDNA and telomeric Y' regions. We further observed that circles can have flexible inheritance patterns: [HXT6/7circle] normally segregates to mother cells but in low glucose is present in up to 50% of cells, the majority of which must have inherited this circle from their mother. Interestingly, [HXT6/7circle] cells are eventually replaced by cells carrying stable chromosomal HXT6 HXT6/7 HXT7 amplifications, suggesting circular DNAs are intermediates in chromosomal amplifications.

Research signals that anxiety and depression symptomology has increased in university students’ following the COVID-19 outbreak, and mental wellbeing has declined. In response to concerns around mental health of students in Higher Education (HE), and to support the transition to remote working during the pandemic, we designed and implemented an 8-week wellbeing program based on positive education frameworks and practices. The online program was delivered in a West Midlands-based university in the United Kingdom, to undergraduate and postgraduate psychology students. The weekly sessions [ran through a virtual learning environment (VLE)] aimed to 1) provide students with a community and an opportunity to feel connected with other students, 2) introduce students to key concepts of wellbeing, and 3) equip students with knowledge and resources that would help sustain/improve their wellbeing. In this paper we outline how positive education, and specifically the “PERMA” wellbeing framework, has inspired the development of this wellbeing program (including the accompanying VLE webpages and sources of support) and future plans for evaluation. We further describe the content and delivery of this program alongside practical implications, lessons learned and important constraints. We situate this discussion alongside consideration of ongoing wellbeing support requirements following the pandemic and issues regarding wider integration of PERMA approaches in university contexts. © Copyright © 2021 Morgan and Simmons.","Morgan, B.; Simmons, L.",Frontiers in Education,279,24

Although RT-PCR-based nucleic acid detection has been primarily used in the diagnosis of COVID-19, it is time-consuming with limited application scenarios and must be operated by qualified personnel. Antibody test, particularly point-of-care antibody testing, is a suitable complement to nucleic acid test as it provides rapid, portable, and cost-effective detection of infections. In this study, a rapid antibody test kit was developed based on fluorescence immunochromatography for the sensitive, accurate, and automated detection of IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in human serum, plasma, and whole blood samples within 10 minutes. The sensitivity, specificity, precision, and stability of the test kit were of good performance. No cross-activity and no interference was observed. In the multiple-center parallel study, 223 samples from hospitalized patients were used to evaluate the clinical specificity of the test. Both SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG achieved a clinical specificity of 98.21%. The clinical sensitivities of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG were 79.54% and 87.45%, respectively, among 733 RT-PCR confirmed SARS-Cov-2 samples. For the combined IgM and IgG assays, the sensitivity and specificity were 89.22% and 96.86%, respectively. Our results demonstrate that the combined use of IgM and IgG could serve as a more suitable alternative detection method for COVID-19 patients, and the developed kit is of great public health significance for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 pandemic.

While there have been several reviews published on COVID-19 and population health disparities generally-including some with attention to HIV-none has focused on sexual health (ie, STI care, female sexual health, sexual behaviour). We have conducted a scoping review focused on sexual health (excluding reproductive health (RH), intimate partner violence (IPV) and gender-based violence (GBV)) in the COVID-19 era, examining sexual behaviours and sexual health outcomes. METHODS: A scoping review, compiling both peer-reviewed and grey literature, focused on sexual health (excluding RH, IPV and GBV) and COVID-19 was conducted on 15 September 2020. Multiple bibliographical databases were searched. Study selection conformed to Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Reviewers' Manual 2015 Methodology for JBI Scoping Reviews. We only included English-language original studies. RESULTS: We found that men who have sex with men may be moving back toward pre-pandemic levels of sexual activity, and that STI and HIV testing rates seem to have decreased. There was minimal focus on outcomes such as the economic impact on sexual health (excluding RH, IPV and GBV) and STI care, especially STI care of marginalised populations. In terms of population groups, there was limited focus on sex workers or on women, especially women's sexual behaviour and mental health. We noticed limited use of qualitative techniques. Very few studies were in low/middle-income countries (LMICs). CONCLUSIONS: Sexual health research is critical during a global infectious disease pandemic and our review of studies suggested notable research gaps. Researchers can focus efforts on LMICs and under-researched topics within sexual health and explore the use of qualitative techniques and interventions where appropriate.","Kumar, Navin; Janmohamed, Kamila; Nyhan, Kate; Forastiere, Laura; Zhang, Wei-Hong; Kågesten, Anna; Uhlich, Maximiliane; Sarpong Frimpong, Afia; Van de Velde, Sarah; Francis, Joel M; Erausquin, Jennifer Toller; Larrson, Elin; Callander, Deton; Scott, John; Minichiello, Victor; Tucker, Joseph",Sex. transm. infect,279,16

A difference-in-difference analysis of the UnderstandingCoronavirus in America study,19.628628,4.2483735,2021,"BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of inherited disorders that result in haemoglobin abnormalities and other complications. Injury to the spleen, among other factors, contribute to persons with SCD being particularly susceptible to infection. Infants and very young children are especially vulnerable. The 'Co-operative Study of Sickle Cell Disease' observed an incidence rate for pneumococcal septicaemia of 10 per 100 person-years in children under the age of three years. Vaccines, including customary pneumococcal vaccines, may be of limited use in this age group. Therefore, prophylactic penicillin regimens may be advisable for this population. This is an update of a Cochrane Review which was first published in 2002, and previously updated, most recently in 2017. OBJECTIVES: To compare the effects of antibiotic prophylaxis against pneumococcus in children with SCD receiving antibiotic prophylaxis compared to those without in relation to: 1. incidence of Streptococcus pneumoniae infection; 2. mortality (as reported in the included studies); 3. drug-related adverse events (as reported in the included studies) to the individual and the community; 4. the impact of discontinuing at various ages on incidence of infection and mortality. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, which is comprised of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and also two clinical trials registries: ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Registry Platform (not in 2020 given access issues relating to Covid-19 pandemic). Additionally, we carried out hand searching of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of the most recent search: 25 January 2021. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing prophylactic antibiotics to prevent pneumococcal infection in children with SCD with placebo, no treatment or a comparator drug. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane were used. Both authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. The authors used the GRADE criteria to assess the certainty of the evidence. MAIN RESULTS: Six trials were identified by the searches, of which three trials were eligible for inclusion. A total of 880 children, who were between three months to five years of age at randomization were included. The included studies were conducted in centres in the USA and in Kingston, Jamaica. In trials that investigated initiation of penicillin on risk of pneumococcal infection, the odds ratio was 0.37 (95% confidence interval 0.16 to 0.86) (two trials, 457 children) (low-certainty evidence), while for withdrawal the odds ratio was 0.49 (95% confidence interval 0.09 to 2.71) (one trial, 400 children) (low-certainty evidence). Adverse drug effects were rare and minor. Rates of pneumococcal infection were found to be relatively low in children over the age of five years. Overall, the certainty of the evidence for all outcomes was judged to be low. The results from the risk of bias assessment undertaken identified two domains in which the risk of bias was considered to be high, these were incomplete outcome data (attrition bias) (two trials) and allocation concealment (selection bias) (one trial). Domains considered to have a low risk of bias for all three trials were selective reporting (reporting bias) and blinding (performance and detection bias). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The evidence examined was determined to be of low certainty and suggests that prophylactic penicillin significantly reduces risk of pneumococcal infection in children with homozygous SCD, and is associated with minimal adverse reactions. Further research may help to determine the ideal age to safely withdraw penicillin.","Rankine-Mullings, Angela E; Owusu-Ofori, Shirley",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,279,1

The main receptor of SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is now undergoing extensive scrutiny to understand the routes of transmission and sensitivity in different species. Here, we utilized a unique dataset of ACE2 sequences from 410 vertebrate species, including 252 mammals, to study the conservation of ACE2 and its potential to be used as a receptor by SARS-CoV-2. We designed a five-category binding score based on the conservation properties of 25 amino acids important for the binding between ACE2 and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Only mammals fell into the medium to very high categories and only catarrhine primates into the very high category, suggesting that they are at high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. We employed a protein structural analysis to qualitatively assess whether amino acid changes at variable residues would be likely to disrupt ACE2/SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding and found the number of predicted unfavorable changes significantly correlated with the binding score. Extending this analysis to human population data, we found only rare (frequency <0.001) variants in 10/25 binding sites. In addition, we found significant signals of selection and accelerated evolution in the ACE2 coding sequence across all mammals, and specific to the bat lineage. Our results, if confirmed by additional experimental data, may lead to the identification of intermediate host species for SARS-CoV-2, guide the selection of animal models of COVID-19, and assist the conservation of animals both in native habitats and in human care.","Damas, Joana; Hughes, Graham M; Keough, Kathleen C; Painter, Corrie A; Persky, Nicole S; Corbo, Marco; Hiller, Michael; Koepfli, Klaus-Peter; Pfenning, Andreas R; Zhao, Huabin; Genereux, Diane P; Swofford, Ross; Pollard, Katherine S; Ryder, Oliver A; Nweeia, Martin T; Lindblad-Toh, Kerstin; Teeling, Emma C; Karlsson, Elinor K; Lewin, Harris A",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,279,22

The aim of this survey was to determine how thoracic surgery program directors (PDs) are adapting to educating residents during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Thoracic surgery PDs of integrated, traditional (2 or 3 year), and combined 4 + 3 general/thoracic surgery training programs in the United States were surveyed between 17th April and 1st May 2020 during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in much of the United States. The 15-question electronic survey queried program status, changes to the baseline surgical practice, changes to didactic education, deployment/scheduling of residents, and effect of the pandemic on case logs and preparedness for resident graduation. RESULTS: All 23 institutions responding had ceased elective procedures, and most had switched to telemedicine clinic visits. Online virtual didactic sessions were implemented by 91% of programs, with most (69.6%) observing same or increased attendance. PDs reported that 82.7% of residents were on a non-standard schedule, with most being deployed in a 1 to 2 week on, 1 to 2 week off block schedule. Case volumes were affected for both junior and graduating trainees, but a majority of PDs report that graduating residents will graduate on time without perceived negative effect on first career/fellowship position. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has radically changed the educational approach of thoracic surgery programs. PDs are adapting educational delivery to optimize training and safety during the pandemic.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The change of the optical properties of ex-vivo breast tissues provides different responses to light transmission, absorption, and particularly the reflection over the spectrum range. We offer the use of Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) with advanced image processing and pattern recognition in order to analyze HSI data for breast cancer detection. The spectral signatures were mined and evaluated in both malignant and normal tissue. K-mean clustering was designed for classifying hyperspectral data in order to evaluate and detection of cancer tissue. This method was used to detect ex-vivo breast cancer. Spatial spectral images were created to high spot the differences in the reflectance properties of malignant versus normal tissue. RESULTS: Trials showed that the superficial spectral reflection images within 500 nm wavelength showed high variance (214.65) between cancerous and normal breast tissues. On the other hand, image within 620 nm wavelength showed low variance (0.0020).However, the superimposed of spectral region 420-620 nm was proposed as the optimum bandwidth. Finally, the proposed HS imaging system was capable to discriminate the tumor region from normal tissue of the ex-vivo breast sample with sensitivity and a specificity of 95 % and 96 %. CONCLUSIONS: High sensitivity and specificity were achieved, which proposes potential for HSI as an edge evaluation method to enhance the surgical outcome compared to the presently available techniques in the clinics.","Aboughaleb, Ibrahim H; Aref, Mohamed Hisham; El-Sharkawy, Yasser H",Photodiagnosis Photodyn Ther,279,20

To address the need for a high-quality neutralization assay against SARS-CoV-2, a previously established fluorescence reduction neutralization assay (FRNA) against Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was modified and optimized. The SARS-CoV-2 FRNA provides a quantitative assessment of a large number of infected cells through use of a high-content imaging system. Because of this approach, and the fact that it does not involve subjective interpretation, this assay is more efficient and more accurate than other neutralization assays. In addition, the ability to set robust acceptance criteria for individual plates and specific test wells provided further rigor to this assay. Such agile adaptability avails use with multiple virus variants. By February 2021, the SARS-CoV-2 FRNA had been used to screen over 5000 samples, including acute and convalescent plasma or serum samples and therapeutic antibody treatments, for SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titers.","Bennett, Richard S; Postnikova, Elena N; Liang, Janie; Gross, Robin; Mazur, Steven; Dixit, Saurabh; Kocher, Gregory; Yu, Shuiqing; Georgia-Clark, Shalamar; Gerhardt, Dawn; Cai, Yingyun; Marron, Lindsay; Lukin, Vladimir V; Holbrook, Michael R",Viruses,279,24

Telehealth has many promised and proven benefits including convenience to the patient, potentially less distraction from the electronic health record (EHR), saves in travel time and expenses, and lowering patients' wait time in the clinic. However, there could be some unintended negative consequences including increased clinician burnout due to screen fatigue, potential loss of information due to the limitations of the medium, difficulty discussing sensitive issues and impacts on patient-clinician relationship, empathy, and compassion. In this perspective, we discuss some of the positives and potential negatives of telehealth and highlight some considerations that could guide the choice of media.

In view of this, there is an urgent need to find a more appropriate therapeutic scheme against COVID-19. The study aimed to investigate whether lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) in combination with other pneumonia-associated adjuvant drugs has a better therapeutic effect on COVID-19. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Totally 47 patients with COVID-19 infection who were admitted to Rui'an People's Hospital between January 22 and January 29, 2020 were collected. The patients were divided into the test group and the control group according to whether they had been treated with LPV/r or not during hospitalization. Patients in the test group were treated with LPV/r combined with adjuvant medicine, while those in the control group were just treated with adjuvant medicine. The changes of body temperature, blood routine and blood biochemistry between the two groups were observed and compared. RESULTS: Both groups achieved good therapeutic effect with the body temperature of patients decreased gradually from admission to the 10th day of treatment. But the body temperature of patients in the test group decreased faster than that of the control group. Blood routine indexes showed that compared with the control group, the abnormal proportion of white blood cells, lymphocytes and C-reactive protein of the test group could be reduced to some extent. Blood biochemical indexes exhibited that the proportion of patients with abnormal alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase in the test group were lower than the control group. The number of days for nCoV-RNA turning negative after treatment was significantly decreased in the test group than that in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the treatment of pneumonia-associated adjuvant drugs alone, the combination treatment with LPV/r and adjuvant drugs has a more evident therapeutic effect in lowering the body temperature and restoring normal physiological mechanisms with no evident toxic and side effects. In view of these conclusions, we suggested that the use of LPV/r combined with pneumonia-associated adjuvant drugs in the clinical treatment for patients with COVID-19 should be promoted.","Ye, X-T; Luo, Y-L; Xia, S-C; Sun, Q-F; Ding, J-G; Zhou, Y; Chen, W; Wang, X-F; Zhang, W-W; Du, W-J; Ruan, Z-W; Hong, L",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,279,30

The objective was to investigate the link between the four-factor structure model of coping and mental health among those living in lockdown. METHODS: The sample was comprised of 100 participants. The data was collected through purposive sampling. Mental health was measured by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and coping strategies from the Brief Cope Inventory. A personal information questionnaire was also used to gather information about the characteristics of participants, such as age, gender and education, in addition to questions related to other stressors. Linear regression was used to assess the association between variables. A P-value < .05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Overall, the results showed high levels of stress, anxiety and depression among participants. These findings revealed a significant association between active avoidance and religious/denial coping strategies and mental health problems. However, problem-focused and positive coping strategies were found to be insignificant for all three mental health problems. Other social and personal factors, such as being away from family (90%), having problems sleeping (86%), worrying about the future (85%), experiencing anger (83%), lacking emotional support (79%) and having fear of receiving bad news (72%), were reported often by participants.

During the quarantine period (from January 24 to February 7, 2020), the concentrations of atmospheric pollutants decreased significantly relative to the period before controls were imposed (from January 15 to 23, 2020). Specifically, except for an increase in the concentration of O3, concentrations of PM10, PM2.5, NO2, SO2, and CO decreased for 72.6 µg·m-3 (45.86%), 47.4 µg·m-3(41.24%), 25.6 µg·m-3 (58.00%), 3.0 µg·m-3 (17.71%), and 0.5 mg·m-3 (31.40%), respectively. RAMS-CMAQ simulation showed that meteorological diffusion had an essential role in improving air quality. Influenced by meteorological factors, emissions of PM10, PM2.5, NO2, SO2, and CO were reduced 26.04%, 33.03%, 28.35%, 43.27%, and 23.29%, respectively. Furthermore, the concentrations of PM10, PM2.5, NO2, SO2, and CO were reduced by 19.82%, 8.21%, 29.65%, -25.56%, and 8.12%, respectively, due to pollution emissions reductions during the quarantine period. O3 concentrations increased by 20.51% during quarantine, caused by both meteorological factors (10.47%) and human activities (10.04%). These results indicate that primary pollutants were more sensitive to emissions reductions; however, secondary pollutants demonstrated a lagged response the emissions reduction and were significantly affected by meteorological factors. The linear relationship between ozone and the emissions reduction was not significant, and was inverse overall. Further investigation are now required on the impact of emissions reduction on ozone pollution control.","Liu, Hou-Feng; Xu, Wei; Wei, Min; Sui, Xiao; Xu, Peng-Ju; Li, Ming-Yan; Zhang, Mei-Gen",Huan Jing Ke Xue,279,26

In this regard, several published studies have examined this question, but the results are inconclusive and inconsistent. To evaluate the sex-difference in the risk of adverse outcomes associated with COVID-19 in the cancer population, we have conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: Published articles evaluating adverse outcomes associated with COVID-19 in the cancer population from inception to June 2020 were identified by searching PubMed and EMBASE, ASCO 2020 Virtual Annual Conference, AACR 2020 COVID-19 and Cancer, ESMO conferences held from January to June 2020, and medRxiv and bioRxiv. Prospective or retrospective analyses in English, providing outcomes data with sex differences in the cancer population were included. The primary outcomes of interest were pooled ORs of severe illness, all-cause death, and the composite of severe illness and death attributable to COVID-19 in males versus females in cancer patients. Findings: Overall, 3968 patients (17 studies) were analyzed in retrospective study settings. Overall, pooled ORs of the composite of severe illness and all-cause death in the setting of COVID-19 in males versus females was 1.60 (95% CI, 1.38-1.85). The risk of severe illness or death were both independently increased in males versus females. Interpretation: Male sex was associated with a higher risk of severe illness and death attributable to COVID-19. This finding has implications in informing the clinical prognosis and decision making in the care of cancer patients.

COVID-19 has proven challenging to the public health system and considering the hearing healthcare, an internet-based survey was conducted on how COVID-19 affected the services to Cochlear Implant users and which consecutively affected their communication needs. Methods: The study was carried out during the period of June-August 2020. The questionnaire consisted of 38 questions, developed and presented via ""Google forms"". The questions were based on the common problems faced by the Cochlear Implant users. The nature of the questions was generally focused on how COVID-19 affected their child's communication due to limited services. The questionnaire was self-administered and the time taken would be 10-15 minutes. The parents of the Cochlear Implanted children were asked to answer the survey with the best of their experience. Results: The overall survey results showed that majority of the respondents observed a variety of problems related to the usage, management and maintenance of Cochlear Implant during this COVID-19 pandemic condition. Conclusions: This report suggests that hearing health care requires a radical rethinking of service delivery and create the momentum to rapidly formulate innovative digital and tele-health approaches in response to these changing situations. © 2021 Korean Association of Speech-Language Pathologists.

This issue of Clinical Kidney Journal provides further evidence of complement activation involvement in COVID-19. Taking advantage of the unique repeat access to chronic haemodialysis patients, the differential time course of C3 and C5 activation in relation to inflammation and severity of disease have been characterized. This further points to complement as a therapeutic target. Indeed, clinical trials targeting diverse components of complement are ongoing. However, a unique case of COVID-19 in a patient with pre-existent atypical haemolytic syndrome on chronic eculizumab therapy suggests that even early eculizumab may fail to prevent disease progression to a severe stage. Finally, preclinical studies in endotoxaemia, another hyperinflammation syndrome characterized by lung and kidney injury, suggest that cilastatin, an inexpensive drug already in clinical use, may provide tissue protection against hyperinflammation in COVID-19.","Ortiz, Alberto",Clin Kidney J,279,20

The aging and degeneration of various tissues and organs in the elderly lead to impaired organ function. Underlying conditions such as chronic lung disease, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes in aged patients are associated with higher mortality. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) primarily interacts with the cell surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 and other accessory proteins such as 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and CD147. Thus, altered receptor signals in aging and chronic disease play a role in SARS-CoV-2 infection, and are associated with a higher risk of deterioration in different organs. In this review, after a brief introduction to the link between aging and receptors for SARS-CoV-2, we focus on the risk of deterioration in different organs of COVID-19 patients considering aging as the main factor. We further discuss the structural and/or physiological changes in the immune system and organs (lung, heart, kidney, vessels, nerve system), as well as those associated with diabetes, in aging patients, and speculate on the most likely mechanisms underlying the deterioration of COVID-19 patients.","Pang, Limin; Liu, Yi; Shen, Maoze; Ye, Jujian; Chen, Ruirong; Lan, Zhien; Wu, Zhijian; Guo, Yang; Zhang, Peidong","Aging (Albany, N.Y.

The present study examined whether individuals or those with someone close to them with a COVID-19 diagnosis differentially experienced anxiety during the pandemic. METHODS: Four web-based repeated cross-sectional surveys were conducted among Canadians aged 18 and older (n = 4015) regarding the impact of COVID-19 on mental health between May 8th and July 14th, 2020. Data on sociodemographic, COVID-19 symptoms/diagnoses for self or someone close, and anxiety were collected. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed controlling for potential confounders. RESULTS: Anxiety among individuals affected by the pandemic remained stable over time. Individuals or those with someone close diagnosed with COVID-19 had greater odds of having anxiety (OR = 1.55; 95%CI 1.12, 2.14) compared to those who had not been diagnosed (self or close other) with COVID-19. Individuals or those with someone close to them who had symptoms of COVID-19 had greater odds of having anxiety (OR = 2.08; 95%CI 1.51, 2.87) compared to those who did not report symptoms (self or close other).

The mechanistic details of this reaction, however, remain unclear, largely due to the difficulty in characterizing unstable reaction products. Herein, we have developed a combined approach involving mass spectrometry (MS) and theoretical calculations to investigate reactions of â¢OH with cysteine disulfides (Cys-S-S-R) in the gas phase. Four types of first-generation products were identified: protonated ions of the cysteine thiyl radical (+Cys-Sâ¢), cysteine (+Cys-SH), cysteine sulfinyl radical (+Cys-SOâ¢), and cysteine sulfenic acid (+Cys-SOH). The relative reaction rates and product branching ratios responded sensitively to the electronic property of the R group, providing key evidence to deriving a two-step reaction mechanism. The first step involved â¢OH conducting a back-side attack on one of the sulfur atoms, forming sulfenic acid (-SOH) and thiyl radical (-Sâ¢) product pairs. A subsequent H transfer step within the product complex was favored for protonated systems, generating sulfinyl radical (-SOâ¢) and thiol (-SH) products. Because sulfenic acid is a potent scavenger of peroxyl radicals, our results implied that cysteine disulfide can form two lines of defense against reactive oxygen species, one using the cysteine disulfide itself and the other using the sulfenic acid product of the conversion of cysteine disulfide. This aspect suggested that, in a nonpolar environment, cysteine disulfides might play a more active role in the antioxidant network than previously appreciated.","Adhikari, Sarju; Crehuet, Ramon; Anglada, Josep M; Francisco, Joseph S; Xia, Yu",Proc.

Postmortem lungs were sampled and studied from these autopsies, with a special focus on several corresponding sites based on imaging features.The predominant pattern of pulmonary injury in these 9 cases was diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and interstitial inflammation. Moreover, acute fibrinous exudates, organization, inflammatory cell infiltration, hyaline membranes, pulmonary edema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, and fibrosis were all observed. The histopathology features varied according to the site and severity of each lesion. In most of the 9 cases, opacities started from a subpleural area and peripheral structures were more severely damaged based on gross views and pathological examinations. Fibrosis could occur in early stages of infection and this was supported by radiological and pathological findings. The radiological features of COVID-19 pneumonia, at the critically ill stage, were diffuse ground-glass opacities with consolidation, interstitial thickening, and fibrous stripes, which was based in the fibrous tissue proliferation in the alveolar and interlobular septa, and filled alveoli with organizing exudation. Fungal and bacterial co-infections were also observed in 6 cases.Typical imaging features can be correlated with underlying pathological findings. Combining assessments of imaging features with pathological findings therefore can enhance our understanding of the histopathological mechanism of COVID-19 pneumonia, and facilitate early radiological diagnosis and prognosis estimation of COVID-19 pneumonia, which has important implications for the development of clinical targeted treatments and research related to COVID-19 pneumonia.","Zhao, Lingyun; Wang, Xi; Xiong, Ying; Fan, Yanqing; Zhou, Yiwu; Zhu, Wenzhen",Medicine (Baltimore),279,16

METHODS: Cross-sectional data were collected during the period of tightest restrictions between 26 April 2020 and 6 June 2020. Eligible participants included all Russian adults aged 18 years and over. Participants reported their sleep patterns and problems, frequency and duration of walking, moderate- and vigorous-intensity PA, and muscle strengthening activities before COVID-19 and during the past 7 days. Access to an outdoor green space and fitness centres, use of online resources, adherence to self-isolation recommendations and other preventive measures from Ministry of Health were self-reported. RESULTS: The sample included 2432 participants from 62 regions, 83% of who were female. There was a significant decline in the number of days per week participants reported not getting enough sleep (3.21 ± 2.44 to 2.86 ± 2.57; P < 0.001); participants also reported an increase in the number of days per week they had trouble falling asleep (1.70 ± 2.24 to 2.13 ± 2.48; P < 0.001).

RECENT FINDINGS: Most of the research on the topic suggests that for the moment our ability to estimate whether SARS-CoV-2 is a direct causative agent in acute kidney injury (AKI) or whether it has a cytokine storm effect is limited. During our prospective assessment of 333 patients with COronaVIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) it was found that frequency of AKI of 9.6% (32 cases). Despite previous data suggestive of the ability to detect SARS-CoV-2 in urine, we were unable to identify any traces of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) in our group. Both COVID-19 severity (odds ratio, ORâ=â23.09, confidence interval, CI 7.89-67.57, Pâ<â0.001) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) history (ORâ=â7.17, CI 2.09-24.47, Pâ=â0.002) were associated with the AKI rate. SUMMARY: AKI is a relatively frequent condition for patients with COVID-19 and is normally correlated with the severity of the disease and the patient's history of CKD. The available data fail to address whether SARS-CoV-2 mRNA is present in urine, whereas our prospective trial data suggest that mRNA is undetectable in urine irrespective of the severity of the disease.","Enikeev, Dmitry; Taratkin, Mark; Efetov, Sergey; Shlomina, Alexandra; Boldyreva, Margarita; Galkina, Irina; Spivak, Leonid; Gitel, Evgeniy; Kuchieva, Agunda; Mikhailov, Vasiliy; Teoh, Jeremy Yuen-Chun; Herrmann, Thomas R W; Kikic, Zeljko; Fomin, Viktor; Shariat, Shahrokh F; Glybochko, Petr",Curr Opin Urol,279,23

Serious games have advantages in the dissemination of reliable information during the pandemic, as they can offer qualified content while providing interactivity with the user and have great reach over the internet. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop a serious game with the purpose of bringing scientific-based information on prevention and personal care against COVID-19. Besides, it proposed to assess the players' knowledge about COVID-19 topics. METHODS: The study was carried out with the interdisciplinary collaboration of specialists in health sciences, computing, and design at the Federal University of Minas Gerais, Brazil. The health recommendations were grouped into six thematic blocks, presented in a quiz format. The software languages were based on the Progressive Web App with the Framework Ionic, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, and Typescripts (Angular). Open data reports of how users interact with the serious game were obtained using the Google Analytics API. The visual identity, logo, infographics, and icons were carefully developed considering a selection of colors, typography, sounds, and images suitable for young audiences. Cards with characters were introduced at the end of each thematic topic to interact with the player reinforcing the correct answers or alert the need to know more about the disease. The players' performance was assessed by the rate of errors and successes and analyzed by the linear correlation coefficient, over seven weeks. The agile SCRUM development methodology provided quick and daily interactions by developers through a webchat and sequential team meetings. RESULTS: The game ""COVID-19 - Did you know?"" was available for free in the university public domain, on April 1st, 2020. The access number was 17,571, until September 2020. Disclosure actions such as reports on social media and television had a temporal correspondence with a greater access number. The players' error rate in the topic ""Mask"" showed a negative trend (r = -.83; P = .01) over the weeks of follow-up. The other topics showed no significant trend over the weeks. CONCLUSIONS: The gamification strategy for health education content on the theme of COVID-19 reached a young audience, considered a priority in the strategy of orientation towards the social distance. Specific educational reinforcement measures were proposed and implemented based on the players' performance. The improvement in the users' performance in the topic about the use of the mask may reflect more information or adherence to its use over time.","Gaspar, Juliano De Souza; Lage, Eura Martins; Silva, Fernando José Da; Mineiro, Érico; Oliveira, Isaias José Ramos De; Oliveira, Igor; Souza, Rayner Guilherme De; Gusmão, Juan Rodrigues Oliveira; Souza, Camila Fernanda Donadoni De; Reis, Zilma Silveira Nogueira",,279,17

These sectors are becoming increasingly interlinked in environmental policy-making and with regard to achieving supply security. There is a pressing need for a systematization of impacts and responses beyond individual disruptions. This paper provides a holistic assessment of the implications of COVID-19 on the water-energy-food (WEF) nexus. First, it integrates the academic literature related to single cases and disruptions to provide a broader view of COVID-19 demand- and supply-side disruptions and immediate effects. Then, the major, long-term impact categories of medicalization/hygienization, (re)localization of production, and demand fluctuations are highlighted. These impacts result in priority cross-links such as irrigation, energy requirements for local food production, energy use for water and wastewater treatment, or water for energy use. Finally, sector-level insights on impacts and responses are provided, drawing from illustrative cases. The analysis of impacts of COVID-19 on the WEF nexus reflects heterogeneous experiences of short-term adaptations, and highlights the revaluation of the water-food-trade nexus. Revived debates on food sufficiency can benefit from green applications to minimize expected trade-offs. The current crisis also reveals some gaps in the WEF nexus debates with regard to the lack of risk-based perspectives and the need for a better consideration of spatial aspects in resource integration. Regarding resource-security issues in the WEF nexus, the COVID-19 stress test boosts debates concerning the adequacy of the production value chains (e.g., contingency and storage, diversification, and self-sufficiency) and the value of cross-border integration (e.g., trade, globalization, and aid).","Al-Saidi, Mohammad; Hussein, Hussam",Sci Total Environ,279,26

Methods: The data of five patients of neurological diseases combined with COVID-19 (including two suspected cases) in the Department of Neurology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 1, 2020 to February 24, 2020 were retrospectively collected. The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, laboratory and radiologic characteristics, diagnosis, treatment and outcomes of these cases were described and analyzed. Results: Among the five patients, three were confirmed cases and two were suspected cases with a history of indirect contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19. The age of these patients was (76.4±9.3) years. Neurological diseases included cerebral infarction in two cases, cerebral hemorrhage, Guillain-Barre syndrome and Alzheimer’s disease each in one case. There were one acute case and one chronic case, and three patients were in the sequelae stage of acute diseases. One patient had an open airway as a result of Guillain-Barre syndrome. There were four cases of limb paralysis, half of whom were hemiplegic and quadriplegic respectively. The initial symptom was fever in all cases, and they showed a decrease in lymphocyte count. Four patients with chest computed tomographic scans showed bilateral lung lesions, of whom two cases showed multiple lung patches and ground glass shadows. Tests for 2019 novel coronavirus nucleic acid were positive in three patients and negative in two. The time from onset of COVID-19 to diagnosis was (6.6±5.6) d. As of February 24, two patients died and the remaining were still hospitalized. Conclusions: Neurological diseases, especially in elderly patients with limb paralysis, open airways and stroke, can be complicated by COVID-19, of which the prognosis is poor. Neurologists need to identify this situation early and pay attention to strengthening protection.","Cao, Qian; Lu, Zuneng",Chin. J. Neurol.,279,16

METHODS: Barthel index (BI), St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire adapted to patients with COVID-19 (aSGRQ) and WHO Clinical Progression Scale (CPS) were measured at enrolment and at 6 weeks from the onset of symptoms. Persistence of most frequently reported symptoms was assessed at 6 weeks and, among symptomatic patients, at 12 weeks from the onset of symptoms. Predictors of impaired general health over time were identified using an ordinal multilevel multivariate model. RESULTS: A total of 448 patients (55% men, median age 56 years) were enrolled. WHO-CPS showed mild, moderate and severe disease in 48%, 42% and 10% of patients at admission and mild disease in all patients at follow-up, respectively. BI and aSGRQ were normal in 96% and 93% patients before COVID-19 but only in 47% and 16% at COVID-19 diagnosis and in 87% and 65% at 6-week follow-up. Male gender was identified by all three assessments as a predictor of impaired general health (BI, OR 2.14, p < 0.0001; aSGRQ, OR 0.53, p = 0.003; WHO-CPS, OR 1.56, p = 0.01). Other predictors included age, ICU admission and comorbidities (e.g. cardiovascular disease and cancer) for BI, hospital admission for aSGRQ, age and presence of comorbidities for WHO-CPS. At 6- and 12-week follow-up, 39% and 20% of patients, respectively, were still reporting symptoms. Fatigue and breathlessness were the most frequently reported symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term follow-up facilitates the monitoring of health impairment and symptom persistence and can contribute to plan tailored interventions.","Righi, Elda; Mirandola, Massimo; Mazzaferri, Fulvia; Razzaboni, Elisa; Zaffagnini, Amina; Erbogasto, Anna; Vecchia, Ilaria Dalla; Auerbach, Nina; Ivaldi, Federico; Mongardi, Maria; Minuz, Pietro; Milella, Michele; Mehrabi, Sara; Olivieri, Oliviero; Girelli, Domenico; Polati, Enrico; Micheletto, Claudio; Tacconelli, Evelina",Infect Dis Ther,279,21

This study presents the trends in mortality associated with Covid-19 for women and men during the first year of the pandemic. MethodsThis study was based in 17 Spanish hospitals. Sociodemographic, clinical, and mortality data from all patients with Covid-19, who had been discharged alive, or had died after being admitted, between March 2020 and February 2021, were used. The association between time of admission and mortality was examined with multivariate logistic regression models. Results3390 Covid-19 patients were included in the study, of which 1330 were women, the age was M(SD): 66.55(16.55) Death was reported for 451 patients. There was a significant decreasing trend in mortality by time of admission for the whole year with an OR: 0.86(0.77-0.96) p=0.005. No significant trend in mortality for women was observed OR: 1.00(0.85-1.19) p=0.959, while there was a significant decreasing trend for men OR: 0.78 (0.68-0.90) p=0.001 DiscussionThe health policies put in place, the scientific evidence developed by researchers, and the experienced acquired by clinicians, are likely to explain this improvement in mortality. More epidemiological and clinical studies addressing trends of mortality in patients with different sociodemographic and clinical profile and the improvement of clinical outcomes are required. Future research may address the safety and efficacy of interventions specifically in female patients.","Ayerbe, Luis; Risco-Risco, Carlos; Martinez-Urbistondo, Diego; Caro-Tinoco, Maria Elena; Ayis, Salma",,279,26

Poor mental health is the most common reason for NHS staff sickness absences, usually accounting for 25% of all reported sick leave. At a time when the NHS most needs an available and efficient workforce, government and NHS employers lack the necessary evidence to inform decisions about how best to support the mental health needs of its staff. In this report, we share our experience and the initial figures from a newly developed multidisciplinary assessment and treatment service for NHS staff.MethodThe Staff Mental Health Service (SMHS) at the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust (CPFT) launched in September 2020. The SMHS is commissioned by the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough sustainability and transformation partnership and is accessible to the 25,513 staff based at five NHS trusts within the region. The service received 235 referrals within 5 months of the launch. All patients had a first clinical contact within three working days and more than 80% had their initial assessment within two weeks. The SMHS clinical team is comprised of consultant psychiatrists, senior clinical psychologists, specialist mental health nurses, and an occupational health nurse set to provide rapid access, confidential, evidence-based treatments for the NHS staff. As part of service evaluation within CPFT, we collected routine screening data (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), and Posttraumatic Symptom Check List – 6 (PCL-6)) from patients completing the initial assessment (n = 130).ResultAccording to the initial figures (n = 130) from a diverse group of healthcare staff, on average the patients presented with moderate level of depressive symptoms (PHQ-9: 16.22 ± 5.94). Anxiety levels were in moderate to severe range (GAD-7: 13.45 ± 4.70). Average score of PCL-6 checklist for traumatic stress symptoms was higher than the established cut-off (&gt;14): 19.43 ± 5.65.ConclusionThe Staff Mental Health Service offers an innovative, multi-disciplinary rapid assessment and treatment clinic for NHS staff. The demand for the service has been immense, reaching double the number of predicted referrals. Initial data suggested high rates of moderate to severe depression, anxiety, and traumatic stress symptoms in healthcare workers. Our clinical observations was that many healthcare workers have had longstanding significant mental health conditions that saw deterioration during the COVID-19 pandemic. We hope that our experience in the SMHS will help inform models across the UK to address the clear unmet need for staff mental health.","Kaser, Muzaffer Martin Zoe Walsh Cathy",BJPsych Open,279,20

Dentistry and oral and maxillofacial surgery (CMFS) are particularly affected due to direct exposure to the respiratory tract, as the reservoir of SARS-CoV-2. In this study, the impact of the COVID-19-pandemic on a dental and CMFS emergency services in Germany in 2020 was first time investigated and correlated with governmental restriction measures in public life. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Epidemiological data of a German University Hospital were analysed from a total of 8386 patients in 2019 and 2020. Parameters included information on demographics, time, weekday and reason for presentation, as well as diagnosis and therapy performed. Data from 2020 were compared with those from 2019, taking into account the nationwide periods of public life restrictions. RESULTS: In 2020, 22% fewer patients presented via dental and CMFS emergency service. In a monthly comparison, there were negative peaks of up to - 41% in November, but also a plus of 26% in July. The largest decreases were recorded during the lockdown periods in spring (- 33%) and winter (- 39%). Further, a threefold increase in actual emergencies and inpatient admissions revealed during these time periods (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the dental and CMFS emergency service in 2020 resulting in more severe cases. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study underlines the importance of maintaining an emergency service system and basic outpatient care in these specialities, which requires uniform recommendations from the medical-dental societies and politics.","Thiem, D G E; Polsak, M; Römer, P; Gielisch, M; Blatt, S; Al-Nawas, B; Kämmerer, P W",Clin. oral investig,279,26

RNA-sequencing analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, single-cell bioinformatics analysis and immunohistochemistry of lung autopsy samples revealed that myelomonocytic cells and endothelial cells express high levels of PTX3 in patients with COVID-19. Increased plasma concentrations of PTX3 were detected in 96 patients with COVID-19. PTX3 emerged as a strong independent predictor of 28-d mortality in multivariable analysis, better than conventional markers of inflammation, in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The prognostic significance of PTX3 abundance for mortality was confirmed in a second independent cohort (54 patients). Thus, circulating and lung myelomonocytic cells and endothelial cells are a major source of PTX3, and PTX3 plasma concentration can serve as an independent strong prognostic indicator of short-term mortality in COVID-19.","Brunetta, Enrico; Folci, Marco; Bottazzi, Barbara; De Santis, Maria; Gritti, Giuseppe; Protti, Alessandro; Mapelli, Sarah N; Bonovas, Stefanos; Piovani, Daniele; Leone, Roberto; My, Ilaria; Zanon, Veronica; Spata, Gianmarco; Bacci, Monica; Supino, Domenico; Carnevale, Silvia; Sironi, Marina; Davoudian, Sadaf; Peano, Clelia; Landi, Francesco; Di Marco, Fabiano; Raimondi, Federico; Gianatti, Andrea; Angelini, Claudio; Rambaldi, Alessandro; Garlanda, Cecilia; Ciccarelli, Michele; Cecconi, Maurizio; Mantovani, Alberto",Nat. immunol,279,15

Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a new type of coronavirus, which has high contagion and mainly causes respiratory symptoms. With the increase in confirmed cases, however, the infection symptoms turn to be diverse with secondary or first clinical symptoms relating to damage of the cardiovascular system and changes of myocardial enzyme spectrum, cardiac troponin I, electrocardiogram, cardiac function. The occurrence of extra-pulmonary manifestations, including immediately and long-term damage, means that the overall health burden caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection may be under-estimated because COVID-19 patients developed cardiovascular system injury are more likely to become serious. The factors such as directly pathogen-mediated damage to cardiomyocytes, down-regulated angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression, excessive inflammatory response, hypoxia and adverse drug reaction, are closely related to the occurrence and development of the course of COVID-19.

The first case was identified in December 2019, in Wuhan, China. It is an infectious disease and has led to the ongoing global pandemic. This pandemic has also started in Assam, with its first case reported on 31 March, 2020. A prospective study was conducted on 2000 laboratory confirmed coronavirus cases. Proper history were taken and clinical examinations were performed. They were also advised to do the necessary blood investigations, electrocardiogram and chest X- rays. Olfactory functions were assessed using substances like scented soap, mint toothpaste, vicks vaporub, etc. Gustatory functions were also assessed. In our study, we found that 83% (1650) patients presented with otorhinolaryngological or ENT (Ear, nose, throat) manifestations and 17% (350) did not have any otorhinolaryngological manifestations. The most common ENT symptoms with which the patients presented were sore throat (80%) and headache (76%). The other ENT symptoms were hyposmia (44%), dysgeusia (32%) and nasal congestion (28%). The most common non-ENT symptoms were fever (92%) and cough (85%). The other non-ENT symptoms with which the patient presented were malaise, generalized bodyache and abdominal symptoms (like diarrhea). This prospective study gives a view of the incidence of otorhinolaryngological manifestations in COVID 19 patients. But, no significant co-relation was seen between presence of ENT symptoms and the severity of the disease. However, further studies are required to know the pathogenesis of causing ENT symptoms properly and also for definitive treatment of these symptoms.","Borah, Hironya; Das, Sunita; Goswami, Abhilasha",Indian J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,279,16

Studying its evolution laws has a certain reference effect for the judgment of urban population aggregations, the division of precise control zoning, and the differentiated management of places during the COVID-19 control period. Based on the data of Baidu heat maps and points of interest (POIs), this paper uses three models of the population density index (PDI), the exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) and the geological detector (Geodetector) to analyze the characteristics and the influencing factors of the evolution of population distribution of Xi’an in three stages which are closed control stage, unsealed control stage and slack control stage. The results show that: in the three stages, 1) The value of the PDI and the range of the PDI change in Xi’an continue to increase. The single-day PDI curve shows “low-high-low” changing characteristics from morning to night in and within the third ring zone, and “high-low-high” in the suburb. And, by comparison, it is found that the social vitality of the first and second ring zone is more strongly impacted because of COVID-19 control measures. 2) The overall population density in Xi’an is gradually increasing, this is represented by gradual increase of the very high- and the high-density areas, and continuous decrease of the low- and the very low-density areas. And the centripetal distribution of population density, which is high inside the city and low outside the city, is becoming more and more obvious. 3) The spatial distribution of population density represents obvious high-value clusters or low-value clusters in the three stages, ESDA shows a circle structure of inner heat and outer cold, and this trend continues to be reinforced. 4) The intensity order of influencing factors of the 7 types of facilities on population distribution is: residential communities &gt; catering facilities &gt; living service facilities &gt; healthy facilities &gt; commercial facilities &gt; office places &gt; green spaces and squares, and the influencing factor intensities show a continuous increasing or a continuous decreasing process in the three stages.","Zhao, Kaixu Zhang Shuaibing Li Enlong Chen Xiaolan Wu Fengqi",IOP Conference Series.

In addition, case reports have described ivermectin-related serious adverse drug reactions (sADRs) such as toxidermias, hepatic and renal disorders. The aim of this study was to identify suspected sADRs reported after ivermectin administration in VigiBase, the World Health Organization’s global individual case safety reports database and analyze their frequency relative to the frequency of these events after other antinematodal drugs reported in SSA and other areas of the world (ROW). METHODS: All antinematodal-related sADRs were extracted from VigiBase. Disproportionality analyses were conducted to investigate nervous, cutaneous, psychiatric, respiratory, renal, hepatic and cardiac suspected sADRs reported after ivermectin and benzimidazole drug administration across the world, in SSA and RoW. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: 2041 post-ivermectin or post-benzimidazole suspected sADRs were identified including 667 after ivermectin exposure (208 in SSA and 459 in the RoW). We found an increased reporting for toxidermias, encephalopathies, confusional disorders after ivermectin compared to benzimidazole drug administration. Encephalopathies were not only reported from SSA but also from the RoW (adjusted reporting odds ratios [aROR] 6.30, 95% confidence interval: 2.68–14.8), highlighting the fact these types of sADR occur outside loiasis endemic regions. CONCLUSION: We described for the first time suspected sADRs associated with ivermectin exposure according to geographical origin. While our results do not put in question ivermectin’s excellent safety profile, they show that as for all drugs, appropriate pharmacovigilance for adverse reactions is indicated.","Campillo, Jérémy T.; Boussinesq, Michel; Bertout, Sébastien; Faillie, Jean-Luc; Chesnais, Cédric B.",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,279,21

Knowledge that one is less at risk after being vaccinated may alleviate distress, but this hypothesis remains unexplored. Here we test whether psychological distress declined in those vaccinated against COVID-19 in the US and whether changes in perceived risk mediated any association. METHODS: A nationally-representative cohort of U.S. adults (N=5,792) in the Understanding America Study were interviewed every two weeks from March 2020 to June 2021 (28 waves). Difference-in-difference regression tested whether getting vaccinated reduced distress (PHQ-4 scores), with mediation analysis used to identify potential mechanisms, including perceived risks of infection, hospitalization, and death. RESULTS: Vaccination was associated with a 0.09 decline in distress scores (95% CI: −0.15 to −0.04) (0–12 scale), a 5.7% relative decrease compared to mean scores in the wave prior to vaccination. Vaccination was also associated with an 8.44 percentage point reduction in perceived risk of infection (95% CI: −9.15% to −7.73%), a 7.44-point reduction in perceived risk of hospitalization (95% CI: −8.07% to −6.82%), and a 5.03-point reduction in perceived risk of death (95% CI: −5.57% to −4.49%). Adjusting for risk perceptions decreased the vaccination-distress association by two-thirds. Event study models suggest vaccinated and never vaccinated respondents followed similar PHQ-4 trends pre-vaccination, diverging significantly post-vaccination. Analyses were robust to individual and wave fixed effects, time-varying controls, and several alternative modelling strategies. Results were similar across sociodemographic groups. CONCLUSION: Receiving a COVID-19 vaccination was associated with declines in distress and perceived risks of infection, hospitalization, and death. Vaccination campaigns could promote these additional benefits of being vaccinated.","Koltai, Jonathan; Raifman, Julia; Bor, Jacob; McKee, Martin; Stuckler, David",medRxiv,279,20

This will benefit from the ability to measure SARS-CoV-2 immunity, ideally with rapid turnaround and without the need for laboratory-based testing. Current rapid point-of-care (POC) tests measure antibodies (Ab) against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, however, these tests provide no information on whether the antibodies can neutralise virus infectivity and are potentially protective, especially against newly emerging variants of the virus. Neutralising Antibodies (NAb) are emerging as a strong correlate of protection, but most current NAb assays require many hours or days, samples of venous blood, and access to laboratory facilities, which is especially problematic in resource-limited settings. We have developed a lateral flow POC test that can measure levels of RBD-ACE2 neutralising antibodies from whole blood, with a result that can be determined by eye (semi-quantitative) or on a small instrument (quantitative), and results show high correlation with microneutralisation assays. This assay also provides a measure of total anti-RBD antibody, thereby providing evidence of exposure to SARS-CoV-2, regardless of whether NAb are present in the sample. By testing samples from immunised macaques, we demonstrate that this test is equally applicable for use with animal samples, and we show that this assay is readily adaptable to test for immunity to newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. Accordingly, the COVID-19 NAb-testTM test described here can provide a rapid readout of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 at the point of care.","Fulford, T. S.; Van, H.; Gherardin, N.

Therefore experiments have been performed to measure the antiviral activity of Sinupret(®) oral drops (hereinafter referred to as “oral drops”) and Sinupret(®) dry extract (hereinafter referred to as “dry extract”), in vitro against a broad panel of both enveloped and non-enveloped human pathogenic RNA and DNA viruses known to cause infections of the upper respiratory tract: influenza A, Chile 1/83 (H1N1) virus (FluA), Porcine Influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) virus (pFluA), parainfluenza type 3 virus (Para 3), respiratory syncytial virus, strain Long (RSV), human rhinovirus B subtype 14 (HRV 14), coxsackievirus subtype A9 (CA9), and adenovirus C subtype 5 (Adeno 5). Concentration-dependent antiviral activity (EC(50) between 13.8 and 124.8 μg/ml) of Sinupret(®) was observed against RNA as well as DNA viruses independent of a viral envelope. Remarkable antiviral activity was shown against Adeno 5, HRV 14 and RSV in which dry extract was significantly superior to oral drops. This could be ascertained with different assays as plaque-reduction assays in plaque forming units (PFU), the analyses of a cytopathogenic effect (CPE) and with enzyme immunoassays (ELISA) to determine the amount of newly synthesised virus.

A blocking ELISA with two appropriate monoclonal antibodies distinguished serological responses of PRCV-infected sows from those of TGEV-immunized sows.

METHODS: Primary and secondary schools reporting an outbreak (≥2 laboratory-confirmed cases within 14 days) to Public Health England (PHE) between 31 August and 18 October 2020 were contacted in November 2020 to complete an online questionnaire. INTERPRETATION: There were 969 school outbreaks reported to PHE, comprising 2% (n = 450) of primary schools and 10% (n = 519) of secondary schools in England. Of the 369 geographically-representative schools contacted, 179 completed the questionnaire (100 primary schools, 79 secondary schools) and 2,314 cases were reported. Outbreaks were larger and across more year groups in secondary schools than in primary schools. Teaching staff were more likely to be the index case in primary (48/100, 48%) than secondary (25/79, 32%) school outbreaks (P = 0.027). When an outbreak occurred, attack rates were higher in staff (881/17,362; 5.07; 95%CI, 4.75–5.41) than students, especially primary school teaching staff (378/3852; 9.81%; 95%CI, 8.90–10.82%) compared to secondary school teaching staff (284/7146; 3.97%; 95%CI, 3.79–5.69%).

The above hitches have rendered researchers to focus on developing alternatives and novel therapeutics for the treatment of these diseases. In the past decade, several target-based drugs have emerged, which focus on specific biochemical pathways of the causative parasites. For leishmaniasis, the targets such as nucleoside analogs, inhibitors targeting nucleoside phosphate kinases of the parasite’s purine salvage pathway, 20S proteasome of Leishmania, mitochondria, and the associated proteins are reviewed along with the chemical structures of potential drug candidates. Similarly, in case of therapeutics for Chagas disease, several target-based drug candidates targeting sterol biosynthetic pathway (C14-ademethylase), L-cysteine protease, heme peroxidation, mitochondria, farnesyl pyrophosphate, etc., which are vital and unique to the causative parasite are discussed.

The use of imaging diagnostics for body composition could help to recognize and treat patients at increased risk of wasting with targeted pathways. COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU underwent computed tomography within 24 h and about 20 days later, to evaluate the parameters of the body and liver composition. The main results were the loss of the lean mass index and a greater increase in liver attenuation in obese subjects. These could be co-caused by COVID-19, prolonged bed rest, the complex medical nutritional therapy, and the starting condition of low-grade inflammation of the obese.

METHODS: The panel used a five-level Likert scale to record agreement or disagreement with 33 statements regarding distal rectus femoris surgery. The panel responded to statements regarding general characteristics, clinical indications, computerized gait data, intraoperative techniques and outcome measures. Consensus was defined as at least 80% of responses being in the highest or lowest two of the five Likert ratings, and general agreement as 60% to 79% falling into the highest or lowest two ratings. There was no agreement if neither threshold was reached. RESULTS: Consensus or general agreement was reached for 17 of 33 statements (52%). There was general consensus that distal rectus femoris surgery is better for stiff knee gait than is proximal rectus femoris release. There was no consensus about whether the results of distal rectus femoris release were comparable to those following distal rectus femoris transfer. Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) level was an important factor for the panel, with the best outcomes expected in children functioning at GMFCS levels I and II. The panel also reached consensus that they do distal rectus femoris surgery less frequently than earlier in their careers, in large part reflecting the narrowing of indications for this surgery over the last decade. CONCLUSION: This study can help paediatric orthopaedic surgeons optimize decision-making for, and outcomes of, distal rectus femoris surgery in children with CP.

I argue that a microlevel perspective assists in making connections between two dominant streams in the literature on government–CSO relations: an empirical–analytical stream and a critical stream. It aims to better understand the interactions and relations, by analysing the institutional work done by CSOs’ members. Adopting this approach puts CSO members in a more agentic position. Interactional processes are brought to the centre of analysis. The Dutch Community Sport Coach programme was used as a case to illustrate the usefulness of the approach. Through a one-year organizational ethnography, the article scrutinizes the way in which members of one CSO enact the organization’s service delivery relationship with a municipality. Through a multidimensional perspective on agency, the analysis shows how individual CSO members act as embedded agents that assimilate a public logic into the dominant community logic. It further shows the CSO’s members efforts and struggle to maintain their community logic. The article argues that an analysis of the microfoundations of government–civil society organization relations foregrounds the multivocality of the relationship as foundational.","Waardenburg, Maikel",Voluntas,279,1

Researchers around the world are aggressively working to develop a vaccine. One of the vaccines approved against COVID-19 is Oxford–AstraZeneca chimpanzee adenovirus vectored vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. CASE REPORT: We described a patient who developed four limb distal paraesthesia, postural instability, and facial diplegia, ten days after vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (ABW1277). The electrophysiological findings were compatible with acute demyelinating motor polyneuropathy (Guillain-Barrè syndrome). DISCUSSION: We therefore want to describe a temporal correlation between administration of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (ABW1277) vaccine and GBS without evidence of other predisposing infectious or autoimmune factors. This paper aims to highlight the importance of pharmacovigilance and subsequent reports will be needed to evaluate the possible correlation between these two events.","Nasuelli, Nicola Alessandro; De Marchi, Fabiola; Cecchin, Michela; De Paoli, Irene; Onorato, Susanna; Pettinaroli, Roberto; Savoini, Giovanni; Godi, Laura",Neurol Sci,279,16

OBJECTIVE: We addressed two related questions: How did emotions change across various stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to what extent were preventive behaviors predicted by emotional reactions and information acquisition? METHODS: We conducted a four-wave longitudinal study in the United States and China across four stages of the pandemic: prepandemic, onset of viral outbreak, ongoing risk, and contained risk. We measured emotions, life satisfaction, preventive behaviors, acquisition of COVID-19 related information, and risk perceptions. We used the Emotional Recall Task (ERT) to investigate people's emotions. By allowing people to describe their emotional experience in their own words, the ERT evaluates each individual based on emotions relevant to their personal experience, making it more suitable for a wider range of contexts and social groups. RESULTS: Boredom, anxiety, fear, and worry were common emotional reactions to the pandemic as it emerged. Surprisingly, participants' emotional experience did not mirror infection and death rates: Instead of negative emotions growing as the virus spread, emotions soon reverted back to normality. This pattern held regardless of whether the viral spread was contained. Consequently, people's preventive behaviors were predicted by fear, anxiety, and worry only at the onset of the viral outbreak. In contrast, actively acquiring information and knowledge about COVID-19 had a more enduring effect on the engagement of preventive behaviors in both countries. CONCLUSION: Our research suggests a possible life cycle of emotional reactions towards a pandemic and highlights the importance of people acquiring information and knowledge about the threat in containing its spread.","Li, Ying; Luan, Shenghua; Li, Yugang; Hertwig, Ralph",Soc Sci Med,279,1

The aim of this study is the identification and characterization of enteric coronaviruses on Spanish pig farms between 2017 and 2019. The study was carried out on 106 swine farms with diarrhea outbreaks where a viral etiology was suspected by using two duplex RT-PCRs developed for the detection of porcine enteric coronaviruses. PEDV was the only coronavirus detected in our research (38.7% positive outbreaks, 41 out of 106) and neither TGEV, SeCoV, PDCoV nor SeACoV were detected in any of the samples. The complete S-gene of all the PEDV isolates recovered were obtained and compared to PEDV and SeCoV sequences available in GenBank. The phylogenetic tree showed that only PEDV of the INDEL 2 or G1b genogroup has circulated in Spain between 2017 and 2019. Three different variants were detected, the recombinant PEDV-SeCoV being the most widespread. These results show that PEDV is a relevant cause of enteric disorders in pigs in Spain while new emerging coronavirus have not been detected so far. However, the monitoring of these virus is advisable to curtail their emergence and spread.","Puente, Héctor; Argüello, Héctor; Mencía-Ares, Óscar; Gómez-García, Manuel; Rubio, Pedro; Carvajal, Ana",Front Vet Sci,279,1

The PBS subsidises nine drugs in the ACE inhibitor class. These drugs are therapeutically equivalent, but the price varies between each drug. Patients are key players in successful therapeutic interchange programmes, but little is known about their views. This study aims to explore patient views of therapeutic interchange of ACE inhibitors in Australian primary care. DESIGN: Qualitative exploratory research study using semi-structured interviews, asking participants about therapeutic interchange and their attitude towards hypothetically switching ACE inhibitors. Data were analysed thematically. SETTING: Australian primary care. PARTICIPANTS: Fourteen adults in Australia currently taking an ACE inhibitor, recruited via general practices and pharmacies, social media and professional networks. FINDINGS: Five key themes were identified: participants’ limited understanding of medication; the expectation that a new drug would be ‘the same’; the view that choice, convenience and fear of change outweigh the cost; altruism; and trust in health professionals, particularly participants’ own general practitioner (GP). CONCLUSIONS: Patients’ limited understanding of medication changes poses a barrier to therapeutic interchange. Clinicians should explore patients’ understanding and expectations of therapeutic interchange. Counselling from trusted health professionals, particularly GPs, could ameliorate concerns. Policymakers implementing therapeutic interchange programmes should ensure a trusted GP directs medication changes.","Marshall, Tessa; Lim, Hok; Lau, Phyllis",BMJ Open,279,23

While the pandemic is global, the dynamics of this infectious disease varies with geography, local policies, and local variations in demographics. An underlying assumption of most infectious disease compartment modeling is that of a well mixed population at the resolution of the areas being modeled. The implicit need to model at fine spatial resolution is impeded by the quality of ground truth data for fine scale administrative subdivisions. To understand the trade-offs and benefits of such modeling as a function of scale, we compare the predictive performance of a SARS-CoV-2 modeling at the county, county cluster, and state level for the entire United States. Our results demonstrate that accurate prediction at the county level requires hyper-local modeling with county resolution. State level modeling does not accurately predict community spread in smaller sub-regions because state populations are not well mixed, resulting in large prediction errors. As an important use case, leveraging high resolution modeling with public health data and admissions data from Hillsborough County Florida, we performed weekly forecasts of both hospital admission and ICU bed demand for the county. The repeated forecasts between March and August 2020 were used to develop accurate resource allocation plans for Tampa General Hospital.","Gopalakrishnan, V.; Pethe, S.; Kefayati, S.; Srinivasan, R.; Hake, P.; Deshpande, A.; Liu, X.; Hoang, E.; Davila, M.; Bianco, S.; Kaufman, J.

Fear of viral infection has influenced the diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer and may result in impairment of surgical and oncologic outcomes. Therefore, we need to analyze the influence of COVID-19 on surgical outcomes of colorectal cancer and provide guidance on proper diagnosis and treatment, including public messaging regarding appropriate healthcare. ABSTRACT: Because of their reluctance to visit the hospital due to concerns about contracting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), patients with colorectal cancer have been affected by delays in care during the pandemic. This study assessed the effects of the pandemic on the clinical characteristics and surgical treatment patterns of colorectal cancer patients at a tertiary medical facility in Korea. Patients who underwent colorectal cancer surgery at our institution between March and September 2020 were analyzed. Clinicopathological and treatment characteristics were compared with those of patients who underwent surgery in 2018 and 2019. The patients who did not undergo tumor resection (4.1% vs. 1.8%, p < 0.001) and who received neoadjuvant treatment (16.7% vs. 14.7%, p = 0.039) were significantly higher during the COVID period. The minimally invasive approach was performed less during the COVID period (81.2% vs. 88%, p < 0.001). More patients in the COVID period required combined resection of organs adjacent to the tumor (4.8% vs. 2.8%, p = 0.017). Surgical aggressiveness, as shown by the proportion of patients undergoing minimally invasive surgery and adjacent organ resection, was significantly influenced by the pandemic. In addition, resectability decreased during the COVID period. These characteristics will likely influence long-term oncological outcomes, indicating the need for long-term monitoring of this cohort.","Choi, Ju Yeon; Park, In Ja; Lee, Hyun Gu; Cho, Eunhae; Kim, Young Il; Kim, Chan Wook; Yoon, Yong Sik; Lim, Seok-Byung; Yu, Chang Sik; Kim, Jin Cheon",Cancers (Basel),279,21

The aim of our study was to contribute to the ongoing discussion regarding gastrointestinal complications related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. After reviewing the current literature, ours appears to be the first detailed case series on the topic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective filtered search of all patients admitted to our hospital for SARS-CoV-2 infection, who developed severe gastrointestinal complications, was performed. All relevant data on hospital patient management, before and after surgery, were collected from the medical records. RESULTS: Of the 905 patients admitted to our hospital due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, as of August 26, 2020, ten of them developed severe gastrointestinal complications. Seven of those patients were men. There were four cases of perforation of the proximal jejunum, three cases of perforations of the ascending colon, one case of concomitant perforation of the sigmoid colon and terminal ileum, one case of massive intestinal necrosis, and one preoperative death. Three right colectomies, four intestinal resections, one Hartmann’s procedure with bowel resection, and one primary repair of the small bowel were performed. The mortality rate of the patients analyzed was 50%.

We analysed an outbreak involving three non-associated families in Restaurant X in Guangzhou, China, and assessed the possibility of aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and characterize the associated environmental conditions. Methods: We collected epidemiological data, obtained a video record and a patron seating-arrangement from the restaurant, and measured the dispersion of a warm tracer gas as a surrogate for exhaled droplets from the suspected index patient. Computer simulations were performed to simulate the spread of fine exhaled droplets. We compared the in-room location of subsequently infected cases and spread of the simulated virus-laden aerosol tracer. The ventilation rate was measured using the tracer decay method. Results: Three families (A, B, C), 10 members of which were subsequently found to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 at this time, or previously, ate lunch at Restaurant X on Chinese New Year's Eve (January 24, 2020) at three neighboring tables. Subsequently, three members of family B and two members of family C became infected with SARS-CoV-2, whereas none of the waiters or 68 patrons at the remaining 15 tables became infected. During this occasion, the ventilation rate was 0.75-1.04 L/s per person. No close contact or fomite contact was observed, aside from back-to-back sitting by some patrons. Our results show that the infection distribution is consistent with a spread pattern representative of exhaled virus-laden aerosols.

However, data are limited as to whether ambient fine particles contribute to the transmission of influenza and if so, how the association is modified by weather conditions. OBJECTIVES: We examined the relationship between ambient PM(2.5) and influenza incidence at the national level in China and explored the associations at different temperatures. METHODS: Daily data on concentrations of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 μm (PM(2.5)) and influenza incidence counts were collected in 47 Chinese cities. A Poisson regression model was used to estimate the city-specific PM(2.5)-influenza association, after controlling for potential confounders. Then, a random-effect meta-analysis was used to pool the effects at national level. In addition, stratified analyses were performed to examine modification effects of ambient temperature. RESULTS: For single lag models, the highest effect of ambient PM(2.5) on influenza incidence appeared at lag day 2, with relative risk (RR) of 1.015 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.004, 1.025) associated with a 10 μg/m(3) increase in PM(2.5). For moving average lag models, the significant association was found at lag 2–3 days, with RR of 1.020 (95% CI: 1.006, 1.034). The RR of influenza transmission associated with PM(2.5) was higher for cold compared with hot days. Overall, 10.7% of incident influenza cases may result from exposure to ambient PM(2.5). CONCLUSIONS: Ambient PM(2.5) may increase the risk of exposure to influenza in China especially on cooler days. Control measures to reduce PM(2.5) concentrations could potentially also be of benefit in lowering the risk of exposure and subsequent transmission of influenza in China.","Chen, Gongbo; Zhang, Wenyi; Li, Shanshan; Zhang, Yongming; Williams, Gail; Huxley, Rachel; Ren, Hongyan; Cao, Wei; Guo, Yuming",Environ Int,279,16

Vaccine acceptance by subgroups of the population depends on their trust in COVID-19 vaccines. We surveyed a probability-based internet panel of 7832 adults from December 23, 2020–January 19, 2021 about their likelihood of getting a COVID-19 vaccine and the following domains of trust: an individual's generalized trust, trust in COVID-19 vaccine's efficacy and safety, trust in the governmental approval process and general vaccine development process for COVID-19 vaccines, trust in their physician about COVID-19, and trust in other sources about COVID-19. We included identified at-risk subgroups: healthcare workers, older adults (65–74-year-olds and ≥ 75-year-olds), frontline essential workers, other essential workers, and individuals with high-risk chronic conditions. Of 5979 respondents, only 57.4% said they were very likely or somewhat likely to get a COVID-19 vaccine. More hesitant respondents (p < 0.05) included: women, young adults (18–49 years), Blacks, individuals with lower education, those with lower income, and individuals without high-risk chronic conditions. Lack of trust in the vaccine approval and development processes explained most of the demographic variation in stated vaccination likelihood, while other domains of trust explained less variation. We conclude that hesitancy for COVID-19 vaccines is high overall and among at-risk subgroups, and hesitancy is strongly tied to trust in the vaccine approval and development processes. Building trust is critical to ending the pandemic.","Szilagyi, Peter G.; Thomas, Kyla; Shah, Megha D.; Vizueta, Nathalie; Cui, Yan; Vangala, Sitaram; Fox, Craig; Kapteyn, Arie",Prev Med,279,1

In our previous work, the nonstructural protein (nsp) 14 of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified as a cap (guanine-N7)-methyltransferase (N7-MTase). In this study, we found that GTP, dGTP as well as cap analogs GpppG, GpppA and m7GpppG could be methylated by SARS-CoV nsp14. In contrast, the nsp14 could not modify ATP, CTP, UTP, dATP, dCTP, dUTP or cap analog m7GpppA. Critical residues of nsp14 essential for the methyltransferase activity on GTP were identified, which include F73, R84, W86, R310, D331, G333, P335, Y368, C414, and C416. We further showed that the methyltransferase activity of GTP was universal for nsp14 of other coronaviruses. Moreover, the accumulation of m7GTP or presence of protein nsp14 could interfere with protein translation of cellular mRNAs. Altogether, the results revealed a new enzymatic activity of coronavirus nsp14.","Jin, Xu; Chen, Yu; Sun, Ying; Zeng, Cong; Wang, Yi; Tao, Jiali; Wu, Andong; Yu, Xiao; Zhang, Zhou; Tian, Jie; Guo, Deyin",Virus Res,279,8

AIMS: The main objective of the study is to assess the results of the application of telematic consultations to limit the mobility of patients. The operational objectives are; to propose a consultation plan, to know how attendance limits consultations and to define which pathologies benefit the most from this plan. METHODS: A scheme is proposed with the creation of pre-scheduled clinic to assess suitability and the possibility of carrying them out in a single non face-to-face act. RESULTS: Phone call to 5619 patients were made with a lack of response of 19% The cases of 74% of the patients that answered were resolved virtually. There is a difference between units, obtaining a higher answering rate from patients appointed to specific clinic units, OR = 0.60, or to general trauma ones, OR = 0.67. The lowest answering rate was obtained from those derived from the emergency department. Twenty per cent of the consultations were not accompanied by complementary tests that would have favored the resolution in a single act. The general trauma consultations, OR = 0.34, postoperative control, OR = 0.49, and specific unit ones, OR = 0.40, were the ones that better met this requirement. Out of the remaining patients, the general trauma consultations, OR = 0.50, and those referred to units, OR = 0.54, were the ones that had a higher resolution rate without in- person consultation. CONCLUSIONS: The cases of 74% of the patients who answered the phone call were resolved virtually. Cases of 20% of the patients cannot be solved in a single act because they are derived without complementary tests. Osteosynthesis and postoperative arthroscopic follow-up consultations are the ones that need to be carried out in person the most.","Zamora Navas, P.",Rev Esp Cir Ortop Traumatol,279,16

A significant hurdle during cancer treatment is the occurrence of intrinsic and acquired therapeutic resistance. This latter case emphasizes the need for new drugs to overcome the challenges resulting from the current therapy. Considering that every drug has at least six off-targets, which might be relevant in cancer therapy, makes drug repurposing an excellent mean to speed up access to new therapeutic options. This review aims to thoroughly discuss anti-microbial agents currently in different trials or those evaluated in pre-clinical settings against various types of cancer and provide an overview of the mechanism(s) by which these agents exert their effects. ABSTRACT: The substantial costs of clinical trials, the lengthy timelines of new drug discovery and development, along the high attrition rates underscore the need for alternative strategies for finding quickly suitable therapeutics agents. Given that most approved drugs possess more than one target tightly linked to other diseases, it encourages promptly testing these drugs in patients. Over the past decades, this has led to considerable attention for drug repurposing, which relies on identifying new uses for approved or investigational drugs outside the scope of the original medical indication. The known safety of approved drugs minimizes the possibility of failure for adverse toxicology, making them attractive de-risked compounds for new applications with potentially lower overall development costs and shorter development timelines. This latter case is an exciting opportunity, specifically in oncology, due to increased resistance towards the current therapies. Indeed, a large body of evidence shows that a wealth of non-cancer drugs has beneficial effects against cancer. Interestingly, 335 drugs are currently being evaluated in different clinical trials for their potential activities against various cancers (Redo database). This review aims to provide an extensive discussion about the anti-cancer activities exerted by antimicrobial agents and presents information about their mechanism(s) of action and stage of development/evaluation.","Pfab, Christina; Schnobrich, Luisa; Eldnasoury, Samir; Gessner, André; El-Najjar, Nahed",Cancers (Basel),279,22

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional prospective CT scan survey was conducted between March 16 and April 12, 2020, in accordance with the local IRB. Seven hundred nine radiology centers were invited to participate in a weekly online survey. Numbers of CT examinations related to COVID-19 including at least chest (CT(covid)) and whole chest CT scan activities (CT(chest)) were recorded each week. A sub-analysis on French departments was performed during the 4 weeks of the study. The impact of the number of RT-PCRs (reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reactions) on the CT workflow was tested using two-sample t test and Pearson’s test. RESULTS: Five hundred seventy-seven structures finally registered (78%) with mean response numbers of 336 ± 18.9 (323; 351). Mean CT(chest) activity per radiologic structure ranged from 75.8 ± 133 (0–1444) on week 12 to 99.3 ± 138.6 (0–1147) on week 13. Mean ratio of CT(covid) on CT(chest) varied from 0.36 to 0.59 on week 12 and week 14 respectively. There was a significant relationship between the number of RT-PCR performed and the number of CT(covid) (r = 0.73, p = 3.10(−16)) but no link with the number of positive RT-PCR results. CONCLUSION: In case of local high density COVID-19, CT workflow is strongly modified and redirected to the management of these specific patients. KEY POINTS: • Over the 4-week survey period, 117,686 chest CT (CT (total) ) were performed among the responding centers, including 61,784 (52%) CT performed for COVID-19 (CT (covid) ). • Across the country, the ratio CT (covid) /CT (total) varied from 0.36 to 0.59 and depended significantly on the local epidemic density (p = 0.003). • In clinical practice, in a context of growing epidemic, in France, chest CT was used as a surrogate to RT-PCR for patient triage.

The synthetic analogue poly I:C is frequently used to mimic anti-viral innate immune responses in models of psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders including schizophrenia, autism, Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease. Many studies perform limited analysis of innate immunity despite these responses potentially differing as a function of dsRNA molecular weight and age. Therefore fundamental questions relevant to impacts of systemic viral infection on brain function and integrity remain. Here, we studied innate immune-inducing properties of poly I:C preparations of different lengths and responses in adult and aged mice. High molecular weight (HMW) poly I:C (1–6kb, 12 mg/kg) produced more robust sickness behavior and more robust IL-6, IFN-I and TNFα responses than poly I:C of <500 bases (low MW) preparations. This was partly overcome with higher doses of LMW (up to 80 mg/kg), but neither circulating IFNβ nor brain transcription of Irf7 were significantly induced by LMW poly I:C, despite brain Ifnb transcription, suggesting that brain IFN-dependent gene expression is predominantly triggered by circulating IFNβ binding of IFNAR1. In aged animals, poly I:C induced exaggerated IL-6, IL-1β and IFN-I in the plasma and similar exaggerated brain cytokine responses. This was associated with acute working memory deficits selectively in aged mice. Thus, we demonstrate dsRNA length-, IFNAR1- and age-dependent effects on anti-viral inflammation and cognitive function. The data have implications for CNS symptoms of acute systemic viral infection such as those with SARS-CoV-2 and for models of maternal immune activation.","McGarry, Niamh; Murray, Carol L.; Garvey, Sean; Wilkinson, Abigail; Tortorelli, Lucas; Ryan, Lucy; Hayden, Lorna; Healy, Daire; Griffin, Eadaoin.

New transport modes were developed so that stem cell products could be safely delivered despite COVID-19-related travel restrictions. Cryopreservation of stem cell products became the new temporary standard during the pandemic to minimize risks related to transport logistics and donor availability. However, many products from unrelated donors will never be transfused. DKMS discontinued public offline donor recruitment, leading to a 40% decline in new donors during the crisis.

Data regarding clinical characteristics, demographic characteristics, intensive care unit (ICU) rate in patients admitted to ICU, laboratory results on day 1 and 7, thoracic computed tomography (CT) findings and oral anti-diabetic drugs used were extracted from medical records. In all patients, 75-days mortality was recorded. Data were assessed independently. RESULTS: There was pneumonia in 386 (89.4%) of 432 patients with diabetes. The risk for pneumonia was markedly higher in patients on DPP-4 inhibitors; however, there was no significant among other oral anti-diabetic groups and subgroups. In addition, elevated CRP was linked to the increased risk for pneumonia. Only patients in the pneumonia group had SGLT-2 inhibitor use. During follow-up, 91 patients died. In Cox regression analysis, low Glasgow Coma Scale score, and increased lactate dehydrogenase levels were identified as significant independent risk factors for mortality.

Although harm perceptions have been linked to youth e-cigarette use, little research focuses on vulnerable populations, such as Appalachian youth. This study examines associations between e-cigarette harm perceptions and tobacco use among a sample of Appalachian youth. METHODS: Using data from the 2014–2016 Youth Appalachian Tobacco Study (n=1074), distributions of six e-cigarette harm perceptions by tobacco use (never, ever non-e-cigarette, ever e-cigarette) were examined, and multivariable multinomial logistic regression was used. RESULTS: Nearly one-fourth (23.4%) of the sample were ever e-cigarette users. More e-cigarette users were male (53.4%) and in high school (57.0%). Fewer e-cigarette users strongly agreed that e-cigarettes cause health problems (15.1%), breathing problems (20.3%), and oral health problems (18.7%) and that e-cigarettes are addictive (25.1%), compared to never and non-e-cigarette users. More e-cigarette users strongly agreed (32.3%) that e-cigarettes are healthier alternatives to cigarettes compared to never (24.1%) and non-e-cigarette (25.7%) users. Regression models indicate that e-cigarette users had greater odds of strongly disagreeing with e-cigarettes being harmful or addictive, compared to never users. E-cigarette users had approximately six-fold odds of strongly disagreeing with e-cigarettes causing health problems (OR=6.12; 95% CI: 3.16–11.90) and two times greater odds of disagreeing with e-cigarettes being addictive (OR=2.09; 95% CI: 1.07–4.08) compared to never users.

However, ACE2 also serves as the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Infection by SARS-CoV-2 can promote endothelial dysfunction which in turn is associated with greater infection severity. Long chain omega-3 fatty acids (n3 PUFA) like eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are reported to prevent endothelial dysfunction. Thus, we hypothesize that treatment with n3 PUFA may suppress the actions of SARS-CoV-2 on endothelial cells, potentially through endothelial ACE2. The objective of the study was therefore to investigate whether changes in ACE2 levels occur as part of the endothelial response to n3 PUFA treatment. METHODS: Male fa/fa Zucker rats were randomised into 4 PUFA-based diet groups: α-linoleic acid (ALA), EPA, DHA, and linoleic acid (LA), for 8 weeks. EA.hy926 cells were cultured to sub-confluent and quiescent states and treated with various doses of DHA, EPA, and ALA for 8 or 24 h. ACE2 levels in tissues and cells were quantified by Western blotting. RESULTS: In contrast to ALA and EPA, DHA treatment significantly reduced ACE2 levels in rat heart, aorta, and kidney but not lungs after 8 weeks of diet intervention. EPA only showed this reduction compared to ALA in kidney. Interestingly, when applied to human endothelial cells in culture, DHA decreased ACE2 levels of growing EA.hy926 cells even at relatively low doses, but no significant effect was observed in quiescent cells. EPA also had an effect, but only at an extremely high dose. CONCLUSIONS: DHA reduced ACE2 levels in key organs and human endothelial cells, which should produce beneficial effects by lowering the susceptibility of cells to SARS-CoV-2.

We monitored SARS-CoV-2 infection rates in school-aged children and compared them with adult infection rates before and after schools reopened in England. METHODS: Public Health England receives daily electronic reports of all SARS-CoV-2 tests nationally. SARS-CoV-2 infection rates by school year from July to December 2020 were analysed, including the effect of a national month-long lockdown whilst keeping schools open in November 2020 RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 infections rates were low during early summer but started increasing in mid-August, initially in young adults followed by secondary and then primary school-aged children prior to schools reopening in September 2020. Cases in school-aged children lagged behind and followed adult trends after schools reopened, with a strong age gradient in weekly infection rates. There was a strong (P<0.001) correlation in regional infection rates between adults and secondary (R(2)=0.96-0.98), primary (R(2)=0.93-0.94) and preschool-aged (R(2)=0.62-0.85) children. The November lockdown was associated with declines in adult infection rates, followed a week later, by declines in student cases. From 23 November 2020, cases in adults and children increased rapidly following the emergence of a more transmissible novel variant of concern (VUI-202012/01; VOC B.1.1.7). CONCLUSIONS: In school-aged children, SARS-CoV-2 infections followed the same trajectory as adult cases and only declined after national lockdown was implemented whilst keeping schools open. Maintaining low community infection rates is critical for keeping schools open during the pandemic.","Mensah, Anna A; Sinnathamby, Mary; Zaidi, Asad; Coughlan, Laura; Simmons, Ruth; Ismail, Sharif A; Ramsay, Mary E; Saliba, Vanessa; Ladhani, Shamez N",J Infect,279,16

Our goal is to determine if pre-existing fatty liver is more prevalent in hospitalized COVID-19 patients compared to patients admitted before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and determine the disease severity among fatty liver patients. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: This retrospective study involves a case and a control group consisting of 1162 patients; the case group contains hospitalized COVID-19 patients with positive PCR tests and available chest CT-scan; the control group contains patients with available chest CT-scan previous to the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients’ data such as liver Hounsfield unit, hospitalization length, number of affected lobes, and total lungs involvement score were extracted and compared between the patients.

In comparison to hospitalized non-fatty liver COVID-19 patients, data from hospitalized COVID-19 patients with fatty liver indicate a longer hospitalization length (6.81 ± 4.76 P = 0.02), a higher total lungs involvement score (8.73 ± 5.28 P < 0.001), and an increased number of affected lobes (4.42 ± 1.2 P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The statistical analysis shows fatty liver is significantly more prevalent among COVID-19 against non-COVID-19 patients, and they develop more severe disease and tend to be hospitalized for more extended periods.","Ziaee, Arash; Azarkar, Ghodsiyeh; Ziaee, Masood",Eur J Med Res,279,1

The algorithm is designed to reduce the impact of missing values in the set of variables measured, and consider only variables that show good accuracy on validation data. The final predictive model provides accuracy larger than 85% on test data, including a new patient cohort from the second COVID-19 wave, and on patients with imputed missing values.

It relies on the enhancement of biodiversity and related ecosystem services to support agricultural production. It is dependent on biological interactions for the design and management of agricultural systems in agricultural landscapes. OBJECTIVES: We review the role of landscape ecology to understand and promote biodiversity, pest regulation and crop pollination for the designing of “agroecology landscapes”. We illustrate the use of landscape ecological methods for supporting agroforestry systems as an example of agroecological development, and we propose pathways to implement agroecology at landscape scale. METHODS: The state of the art of how landscape ecology contributes to agroecology development is summarized based on a literature review. RESULTS: Agroecology requires thinking beyond the field scale to consider the positioning, quality and connectivity of fields and semi-natural habitats at larger spatial scales. The spatial and temporal organisation of semi-natural elements and the crop mosaic interact. Understanding this interaction is the pre-requisite for promoting patterns and mechanisms that foster biodiversity and ecosystem service provision. Promoting agroecological practices beyond individual farm borders can be rooted in a bottom-up approach from agroecological lighthouse farms to farm networks to amplify agroecology adoption at the landscape scale. CONCLUSIONS: Achieving agricultural landscapes composed of fields and farms following agroecological management requires understanding of biodiversity patterns, biological interactions and mechanisms that determine and boost ecosystem functioning to improve services at landscape scale, involving farmers in a bottom-up and context-specific approach.","Jeanneret, Ph.; Aviron, S.; Alignier, A.; Lavigne, C.; Helfenstein, J.; Herzog, F.; Kay, S.; Petit, S.",Landsc Ecol,279,28

School closures have upended life for children and families, and educators have been forced to determine how to provide distance learning. Schools are also an essential source of nonacademic supports in the way of health and mental health services, food assistance, obesity prevention, and intervention in cases of homelessness and maltreatment. This article focuses on the physical and emotional toll resulting from school closures and the withdrawal of nonacademic supports that students rely on. The COVID‐19 pandemic is shining a spotlight on how important schools are for meeting children's nonacademic needs. We argue that when students return to school there will be a more acute and wider‐spread need for school‐based nonacademic services and supports. Further, we expect that COVID‐19 will serve as a focusing event opening a window of opportunity for programmatic and policy change that improves nonacademic services and supports in the future.","Hoffman, Jessica A.; Miller, Edward A.",World Med Health Policy,279,3

Elective surgery and procedures (ESP) resumption has proven to be a calculated risk between COVID-19 exposure and resource depletion and patient morbidity and mortality from surgical deferral. METHODS: Within a few days of halting ESP, our 7-hospital (2427 in-patient beds, 26,647 inpatient surgeries) healthcare system developed a multidisciplinary Pivot Plan with the primary outcome of a phased resumption of ESP. The plan entailed the integration of our electronic medical record, order entry automatization, perioperative staff utilization, partnering with primary care providers, and a step-wise COVID-19 testing algorithm based on a pre-determined hierarchy of case acuity and timeliness of patient care. RESULTS: The Pivot Plan was instituted on May 10, 2020. Since then, 22,624 patients have been tested for COVID-19 in anticipation of an ESP; 140 (0.62%) tested positive for COVID-19 and had their procedure deferred. As our testing capability has increased, we have been able to increase our added ESP capacity from 13 cases per day to 531 cases per day. In turn, we have seen the case volume increase by 52%. CONCLUSION: Our academic healthcare system located in one of the initial COVID − 19 hotspots in the United States has successfully resumed ESP in part due to a receptive and supportive culture, based upon nimbleness, agility, and rapid integration of multiple resources from a cohort of diverse disciplines applied to the perioperative services workflow.","Serrano, Oscar K.; Orlando, Rocco; Papasavas, Pavlos; McClure, Mitchell H.; Kumar, Ajay; Steinberg, Adam C.; Cohen, Jeffrey L.; Shichman, Steven J.; Singh, Rekhinder K.; Sardella, William V.; Schipper, Bret M.",Surg Open Sci,279,16

Microglia play key roles in maintaining CNS homeostasis and acting as first responders to infection and inflammation, and peripheral macrophages infiltrate the CNS during neuroinflammation. Due to their distinct origins and functions, discrimination between these cell populations is essential to the comprehension of neuroinflammatory disorders. Studies comparing the gene profiles of microglia and peripheral macrophages, or macrophages in vitro-derived from bone marrow, under non-infectious conditions of the CNS, have revealed valuable microglial-specific genes. However, studies comparing gene profiles between CNS-infiltrating macrophages and microglia, when both are isolated from the CNS during viral-induced neuroinflammation, are lacking. METHODS: We isolated, via flow cytometry, microglia and infiltrating macrophages from the brains of Theiler’s murine encephalomyelitis virus-infected C57BL/6 J mice and used RNA-Seq, followed by validation with qPCR, to examine the differential transcriptional profiles of these cells. We utilized primary literature defining subcellular localization to determine whether or not particular proteins extracted from the transcriptional profiles were expressed at the cell surface. The surface expression and cellular specificity of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (TREM-1) protein were examined via flow cytometry. We also examined the immune response gene profile within the transcriptional profiles of these isolated microglia and infiltrating macrophages. RESULTS: We have identified and validated new microglial- and macrophage-specific genes, encoding cell surface proteins, expressed at the peak of neuroinflammation. TREM-1 protein was confirmed to be expressed by infiltrating macrophages, not microglia, at the peak of neuroinflammation. We also identified both unique and redundant immune functions, through examination of the immune response gene profiles, of microglia and infiltrating macrophages during neurotropic viral infection. CONCLUSIONS: The differential expression of cell surface-specific genes during neuroinflammation can potentially be used to discriminate between microglia and macrophages as well as provide a resource that can be further utilized to target and manipulate specific cell responses during neuroinflammation.

This study evaluates the tradeoffs between potential benefits (e.g., reduction in infection spread and deaths) of NPIs for COVID19 and being homebound (i.e., refraining from interactions outside of the household). METHODS: An agent-based simulation model, which captures the natural history of the disease at the individual level, and the infection spread via a contact network assuming heterogeneous population mixing in households, peer groups (workplaces, schools), and communities, is adapted to project the disease spread and estimate the number of homebound people and person-days under multiple scenarios, including combinations of shelter-in-place, voluntary quarantine, and school closure in Georgia from March 1 to September 1, 2020. RESULTS: Compared to no intervention, under voluntary quarantine, voluntary quarantine with school closure, and shelter-in-place with school closure scenarios 4.5, 23.1, and 200+ homebound adult-days were required to prevent one infection, with the maximum number of adults homebound on a given day in the range of 119 K–248 K, 465 K–499 K, 5388 K-5389 K, respectively. Compared to no intervention, school closure only reduced the percentage of the population infected by less than 16% while more than doubling the peak number of adults homebound.

We evaluated clinical, microbiologic and postmortem histopathologic findings in childhood deaths in whom severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified antemortem or postmortem. METHODS: Surveillance of childhood deaths was ongoing during the initial COVID-19 outbreak in South Africa from April 14, 2020, to August 31, 2020. All children hospitalized during this time had a SARS-CoV-2 test done as part of standard of care. Postmortem sampling included minimally invasive tissue sampling (MITS) of lung, liver and heart tissue; blood and lung samples for bacterial culture and molecular detection of viruses (including SARS-CoV-2) and bacteria. The cause of death attribution was undertaken by a multidisciplinary team and reported using World Health Organization framework for cause of death attribution. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 was identified on antemortem and/or postmortem sampling in 11.7% (20/171) of deceased children, including 13.2% (12/91) in whom MITS was done. Eighteen (90%) of 20 deaths with SARS-CoV-2 infection were <12 months age. COVID-19 was attributed in the causal pathway to death in 91.7% (11/12) and 87.5% (7/8) cases with and without MITS, respectively. Lung histopathologic features in COVID-19-related deaths included diffuse alveolar damage (n = 6, 54.5%), type 2 pneumocyte proliferation (n = 6, 54.5%) and hyaline membrane formation (n = 5, 36.4%). Culture-confirmed invasive bacterial disease was evident in 54.5% (6/11) of COVID-19 attributed deaths investigated with MITS.

We report the main features of the development of a novel freely accessible model intended to urgently help researchers and decision makers to predict the evolution of the pandemic in their country. Methods and findings We built a SIR-type compartmental model with additional compartments and features. We made the hypothesis that the number of contagious individuals in the population was negligible as compared to the population size. We introduced a compartment D corresponding to the deceased patients and a compartment L representing the group of individuals who will die but who will not infect anybody (due to social or medical isolation). Our model integrated a time-dependent transmission rate, whose variations can be thought to be related to the public measures taken by each country and a cosine function to incorporate a periodic weekly component linked to the way in which numbers of cases and deaths are counted and reported, which can change from day to day. The model was able to accurately capture the different changes in the dynamics of the pandemic for nine different countries whatever the type of pandemic spread or containment measures. The model provided very accurate forecasts in the relatively short term (10 days).

616634,616634,616634,Increased risk of COVID‐19 infection and mortality in people with mental disorders: analysis from electronic health records in the United States,19.614834,4.327652,2020-10-07,"BACKGROUND: During the first COVID-19 pandemic ‘lockdown’ in Aotearoa/New Zealand (March–May 2020, in which strict ‘stay at home’ measures were introduced), general practices were advised to use telephone and video consultations (telehealth) wherever possible instead of the usual in-person visits. This was a sudden change for most practices and patients. This research aimed to explore how patients accessed general practice during lockdown and evaluate their experiences with telehealth, to inform how telehealth could be most effectively used in the future. METHODS: Using a mixed-method approach, we undertook an online survey and in-depth interviews with adults (> 18 years) who had contact with practices during lockdown, recruited through social media and email lists. We present descriptive statistics from the survey data (n = 1010) and qualitative analysis of interview data (n = 38) and open-ended survey questions, using a framework of access to health care, from the patient’s perspective. RESULTS: In general, patients reported high satisfaction with telehealth in general practice during lockdown. Telehealth was convenient and allowed patients to safely access health care without having to weigh-up the fear of COVID-19 infection against the need to be seen. Telehealth worked best for routine and familiar health issues and when rapport was established between patients and clinicians. This was easier with a pre-existing clinical relationship, but not impossible without one. Telehealth was less suitable when a physical examination was needed, when the diagnosis was unknown or for patients who had a strong preference to be seen in-person. CONCLUSIONS: Even in this disruptive lockdown period, that prompted an unexpected and rapid implementation of telehealth services in general practices, most patients had positive experiences with telehealth. In the future, patients want the choice of consultation type to match their needs, circumstances, and preferences. Technological issues and funding barriers may need to be addressed, and clear communication for both patients and clinicians is needed about key aspects of telehealth (e.g. cost, appropriateness, privacy). Maintaining telehealth as an option post-lockdown has the potential to increase timely and safe access to primary health care for many patients.

However, specific information characterizing cardiovascular changes in COVID-19 is limited. Methods: In this single-centered, observational study, we enrolled 38 adult patients with COVID-19 from February 10 to March 13, 2020. Clinical records, laboratory findings, echocardiography, and electrocardiogram reports were collected and analyzed. Results: Of the 38 patients enrolled, the median age was 68 years [interquartile range (IQR), 55–74] with a slight female majority (21, 55.3%). Nineteen (50.0%) patients had hypertension. Seven (33.3%) had ST-T segment and T wave changes, and four (19%) had sinus tachycardia. Twenty (52.6%) had an increase in ascending aorta (AAO) diameter, 22 (57.9%) had an increase in left atrium (LA) size, and 28 (73.7%) presented with ventricular diastolic dysfunction. Correlation analysis showed that the AAO diameter was significantly associated with C-reactive protein (r = 0.4313) and creatine kinase-MB (r = 0.0414). LA enlargement was significantly associated with C-reactive protein (r = 0.4377), brain natriuretic peptide (r = 0.7612), creatine kinase-MB (r = 0.4940), and aspartate aminotransferase (r = 0.2947). Lymphocyte count was negatively associated with the AAO diameter (r = −0.5329) and LA enlargement (r = −0.3894). Conclusions: Hypertension was a common comorbidity among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, and cardiac injury was the most common complication. Changes in cardiac structure and function manifested mainly in the left heart and AAO in these patients. Abnormal AAO and LA size were found to be associated with severe inflammation and cardiac injury. Alternatively, ascending aortic dilation and LA enlargement might be present before infection but characterized the patient at risk for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.","Song, Limin; Zhao, Shuai; Wang, Li; Yang, Kai; Xiao, Weimin; Clifford, Sean P.; Huang, Jiapeng; Chen, Xiangdong",Front Cardiovasc Med,279,5

However, case series have demonstrated a potential benefit in preventing local recurrence with EBRT. We aimed to characterize the patient population treated with EBRT and identify any impact of EBRT on overall survival (OS) in parathyroid carcinoma. METHODS: Patients who underwent surgery for PC from 2004 to 2016 were identified from the National Cancer Database. Clinicopathologic variables and OS were compared between patients based on treatment with EBRT. Multivariable logistic and Cox regression models were performed with propensity scores and inverse-probability-weighting (IPW) adjustment to reduce treatment-selection bias in the OS analysis. RESULTS: A total of 885 patients met the inclusion criteria, with 126 (14.2%) undergoing EBRT. Demographics were similar between the two cohorts (EBRT vs. no EBRT). However, patients treated with EBRT had a higher frequency of regionally extensive disease, nodal metastases, and residual microscopic disease (all p < 0.05). On multivariable analysis, Black race, regional tumor extension, nodal metastasis, and treatment at an urban facility were independently associated with EBRT. The 5-year OS was 85.3% with a median follow-up of 60.8 months. EBRT was not associated with a difference in OS in crude, multivariable, or IPW models. More importantly, 10.5% of patients with completely resected localized disease (M0, N0 or Nx) underwent EBRT without a benefit in OS (p = 0.183). CONCLUSIONS: EBRT is not associated with any survival benefit in the treatment of PC. Therefore, it may be overutilized, particularly in patients with localized disease and complete surgical resection.","Limberg, Jessica; Stefanova, Dessislava; Ullmann, Timothy M.; Thiesmeyer, Jessica W.; Bains, Sarina; Beninato, Toni; Zarnegar, Rasa; Fahey, Thomas J.; Finnerty, Brendan M.",Ann Surg Oncol,279,16

Clinical experience with this delivery model on a large scale has not been described. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to describe usage and satisfaction of providers and lung transplant (LTx) candidates and recipients and functional outcomes following the broad implementation of telerehabilitation with remote patient monitoring during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This study was a program evaluation of providers, LTx candidates, and early LTx recipients who used a web-based, remote monitoring app for at least four weeks between March 16 and September 1, 2020, to participate in telerehabilitation. Within-subjects analysis was performed for physical activity, Self-efficacy For Exercise (SEE) scale score, aerobic and resistance exercise volumes, 6-minute walk test results, and Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) results. RESULTS: In total, 78 LTx candidates and 33 recipients were included (57 [51%] males, mean age 58 [SD 12] years, 58 [52%] with interstitial lung disease, 34 [31%] with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). A total of 50 (64%) LTx candidates and 17 (51%) LTx recipients entered ≥10 prescribed exercise sessions into the app during the study time frame. In addition, 35/42 (83%) candidates agreed the app helped prepare them for surgery and 18/21 (85%) recipients found the app helpful in their self-recovery. The strongest barrier perceived by physiotherapists delivering the telerehabilitation was patient access to home exercise and monitoring equipment. Between the time of app registration and ≥4 weeks on the waiting list, 26 LTx candidates used a treadmill, with sessions increasing in mean duration (from 16 to 22 minutes, P=.002) but not speed (from 1.7 to 1.75 mph, P=.31). Quadriceps weight (pounds) for leg extension did not change (median 3.5, IQR 2.4-5 versus median 4.3, IQR 3-5; P=.08; n=37). On the Rapid Assessment of Physical Activity questionnaire (RAPA), 57% of LTx candidates scored as active, which improved to 87% (P=.02; n=23). There was a decrease in pretransplant 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) from 346 (SD 84) meters to 307 (SD 85) meters (P=.002; n=45) and no change in the SPPB result (12 [IQR 9.5-12] versus 12 [IQR 10-12]; P=.90; n=42). A total of 9 LTx recipients used a treadmill that increased in speed (from 1.9 to 2.7 mph; P=.003) between hospital discharge and three months posttransplant. Quadriceps weight increased (3 [IQR 0-3] pounds versus 5 [IQR 3.8-6.5] pounds; P<.001; n=15). At three months posttransplant, 76% of LTx recipients scored as active (n=17), with a high total SEE score of 74 (SD 11; n=12). In addition, three months posttransplant, 6MWD was 62% (SD 18%) predicted (n=8). CONCLUSIONS: We were able to provide telerehabilitation despite challenges around exercise equipment. This early experience will inform the development of a robust and equitable telerehabilitation model beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.","Wickerson, Lisa; Helm, Denise; Gottesman, Chaya; Rozenberg, Dmitry; Singer, Lianne G; Keshavjee, Shaf; Sidhu, Aman",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,279,16

The involvement of the gastrointestinal tract with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has remained unclear. The following study retrospectively reviews gastrointestinal symptoms and liver function tests at the time of hospital admission to identify patient outcomes including prolonged hospital stay, the requirement for intensive care, and all-cause in-hospital 30-day mortality. Methods A retrospective review of patient charts at the Woodhull Medical and Mental Health Center (WMC) was conducted at the time of hospital admission, using a pre-determined selection criterion. All adult patients, both inpatient and outpatient, were included from March 2020 till May 2020. A 95% confidence interval was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) for patient outcomes. Results Of the 520 patients, gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea (OR = 0.375, p = 0.015), and nausea and vomiting in combination (OR = 0.400, p = 0.016) had an inverse protective relationship with all-cause in-hospital 30-day mortality among COVID-19 patients. Gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhea (OR = 1.008, p < 0.001), and nausea and vomiting (OR = 1.291, p = 0.043) had a mild impact on the length of hospital stay. Conclusion Elevated liver transaminases including alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) at the time of hospital admission can predict critical care requirement and all-cause 30-day hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19 infection. Presence of gastrointestinal symptoms is associated with worsened outcomes.","Deane, Kitson; Singh, Ajay; Sarfraz, Azza; Sarfraz, Zouina; Ciccone, Lyam; Zheng, Beishi; Afzal, Arslan; Khan, Gulam; Rodriguez, Giovanna; Bahtiyar, Gul",Cureus,279,20

Consequently, they also turn to informal learning networks, in order to share and collect information and reach out to their communities. In this context, the current study investigates the underlying networks structures among school leaders, what type of information is being shared, and what differences can be identified when comparing a nation‐wide and a localized sample. We collected data from a US nation‐wide sample of 15 relevant Twitter conversations, as well as Tweets from an US urban mid‐sized public school district. Using a mixed‐methods approach, we discovered several key structural dimensions and a host of highly influential actors. Moreover, we found semantic evidence for users sharing information on topics such as status reports. Finally, we discovered that the urban sample did not overly use the nation‐wide, very specific approach of including COVID‐19 related hashtags. Instead, they used more localized terminologies. These findings are valuable for policy makers, as they map the underlying communication patterns and provide valuable insights into who is moving what types of resources as part of the emerging governance approach on social media. PRACTITIONER NOTES: : Informal networks can be instrumental in providing support during challenging circumstances. School leaders hold a critical position in these networks by accessing and sharing just‐in‐time information and knowledge. Social media provide a wide range of affordances that can support the development of informal networks. : Insights into the intersection between leadership and social networks.

We investigated this in the UK Biobank study. METHODS: The UK Biobank study recruited 40–70-year-olds in 2006–2010 from the general population, collecting information about self-defined ethnicity and socioeconomic variables (including area-level socioeconomic deprivation and educational attainment). SARS-CoV-2 test results from Public Health England were linked to baseline UK Biobank data. Poisson regression with robust standard errors was used to assess risk ratios (RRs) between the exposures and dichotomous variables for being tested, having a positive test and testing positive in hospital. We also investigated whether ethnicity and socioeconomic position were associated with having a positive test amongst those tested. We adjusted for covariates including age, sex, social variables (including healthcare work and household size), behavioural risk factors and baseline health. RESULTS: Amongst 392,116 participants in England, 2658 had been tested for SARS-CoV-2 and 948 tested positive (726 in hospital) between 16 March and 3 May 2020. Black and south Asian groups were more likely to test positive (RR 3.35 (95% CI 2.48–4.53) and RR 2.42 (95% CI 1.75–3.36) respectively), with Pakistani ethnicity at highest risk within the south Asian group (RR 3.24 (95% CI 1.73–6.07)). These ethnic groups were more likely to be hospital cases compared to the white British. Adjustment for baseline health and behavioural risk factors led to little change, with only modest attenuation when accounting for socioeconomic variables. Socioeconomic deprivation and having no qualifications were consistently associated with a higher risk of confirmed infection (RR 2.19 for most deprived quartile vs least (95% CI 1.80–2.66) and RR 2.00 for no qualifications vs degree (95% CI 1.66–2.42)). CONCLUSIONS: Some minority ethnic groups have a higher risk of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in the UK Biobank study, which was not accounted for by differences in socioeconomic conditions, baseline self-reported health or behavioural risk factors. An urgent response to addressing these elevated risks is required.","Niedzwiedz, Claire L.; O’Donnell, Catherine A.; Jani, Bhautesh Dinesh; Demou, Evangelia; Ho, Frederick K.; Celis-Morales, Carlos; Nicholl, Barbara I.; Mair, Frances S.; Welsh, Paul; Sattar, Naveed; Pell, Jill P.; Katikireddi, S.

Novel solutions are needed to enhance substance use treatment during a time when many patients are disconnected from clinical care and social support. Digital phenotyping, which leverages the unique functionality of smartphone sensors (GPS, social behavior, and typing patterns), can buttress clinical treatment in a remote, scalable fashion. Specifically, digital phenotyping has the potential to improve relapse prediction and intervention, relapse detection, and overdose intervention. Digital phenotyping may enhance relapse prediction through coupling machine learning algorithms with the enormous amount of collected behavioral data. Activity-based analysis in real time can potentially be used to prevent relapse by warning substance users when they approach locational triggers such as bars or liquor stores. Wearable devices detect when a person has relapsed to substances through measuring physiological changes such as electrodermal activity and locomotion. Despite the initial promise of this approach, privacy, security, and barriers to access are important issues to address.","Hsu, Michael; Ahern, David K; Suzuki, Joji",JMIR Ment Health,279,1

This sequence functions as a retrieval signal at post-ER compartment(s), but the exact compartment(s) where the retrieval occurs remains unresolved. With an affinity-purified antibody against the carboxyl-terminal sequence of the mammalian KDEL receptor, we have investigated its subcellular localization using immunogold labeling on thawed cryosections of different tissues, such as mouse spermatids and rat pancreas, as well as HeLa, Vero, NRK, and mouse L cells. We show that rab1 is an excellent marker of the intermediate compartment, and we use this marker, as well as budding profiles of the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) in cells infected with this virus, to identify this compartment. Our results demonstrate that the KDEL receptor is concentrated in the intermediate compartment, as well as in the Golgi stack. Lower but significant labeling was detected in the rough ER. In general, only small amounts of the receptor were detected on the trans side of the Golgi stack, including the trans- Golgi network (TGN) of normal cells and tissues. However, some stress conditions, such as infection with vaccinia virus or vesicular stomatitis virus, as well as 20 degrees C or 43 degrees C treatment, resulted in a significant shift of the distribution towards the trans- TGN side of the Golgi stack. This shift could be quantified in HeLa cells stably expressing a TGN marker. No significant labeling was detected in structures distal to the TGN under all conditions tested. After GTP gamma S treatment of permeabilized cells, the receptor was detected in the beta-COP-containing buds/vesicles that accumulate after this treatment, suggesting that these vesicles may transport the receptor between compartments. We propose that retrieval of KDEL- containing proteins occurs at multiple post-ER compartments up to the TGN along the exocytotic pathway, and that within this pathway, the amounts of the receptor in different compartments varies according to physiological conditions.",,J Cell Biol,279,5

Human Leukocyte Antigens are associated with COVID-19 susceptibility, severity, and prognosis. This study aimed to identify HLA-B and -C genotypes among 69 Egyptian patients with COVID-19 and correlate them with disease outcomes and other clinical and laboratory data. HLA-B and -C typing was performed using Luminex-based HLA typing kits. Forty patients (58%) had severe COVID-19; 55% of these patients died, without reported mortality in the moderate group. The alleles associated with severe COVID-19 were HLA-B*41, -B*42, -C*16, and -C*17, whereas HLA-B*15, -C*7, and -C*12 were significantly associated with protection against mortality. Regression analysis showed that HLA-B*15 was the only allele associated with predicted protection against mortality, where the likelihood of survival increased with HLA-B*15 (P < 0.001). Patient survival was less likely to occur with higher total leukocytic count, ferritin, and creatinine levels. This study provides interesting insights into the association between HLA class I alleles and protection from or severity of COVID-19 through immune response modulation. This is the first study to investigate this relationship in Egyptian patients.

From a historical point of view, more than a century of immense corporate fecundity has formed the ecological conditions and shaped current understanding of the effect of public health on CSR. This study sought to examine the extent to which companies are able to balance their business interest with social interest through health-related CSR and how knowledge of them can help explain the potential impact of COVID-19. Method: This study employs a narrative review of current literature; however, the integrative strategy was combined with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist to rigorously select the necessary articles for proper integrative synthesis. Results: We note that in the pursuit of their social responsibility, corporate enterprises struggle to balance the interest of society and their own interest. Genuine CSR activities such as donations are often undermined by unbridled and excessive desire to draw society on themselves to reap economic benefits are largely dominated by the need to advance. There are signals that enterprises might see COVID-19-related CSR as an entry door to increase corporate influence thereby commercializing the pandemic. Conclusions: The impact of COVID-19 on CSR is epochal. There is a moral obligation for enterprises to reform current risk assessments and collaborate more deeply with state agencies to invest in the health and safety inspections at the world place. CSR strategies must be proactive to endure other unknown pandemics with equal capacity to disrupt business operations. Companies must create innovative and regular activities to educate its stakeholders to become more committed to safeguarding future enterprise-based defense mechanism needed to diagnose, protect, treat, and rehabilitate victims and those threatened by pandemics and other emergencies that affect the stability of an organization to reduce its cost and protect revenue.","Asante Antwi, Henry; Zhou, Lulin; Xu, Xinglong; Mustafa, Tehzeeb",Healthcare (Basel),279,1

For patients who received high IgG plasma (>18.45 S/Co), seven-day mortality was 8.9% (6.8%, 11.7%); for recipients of medium IgG plasma (4.62 to 18.45 S/Co) mortality was 11.6% (10.3%, 13.1%); and for recipients of low IgG plasma (<4.62 S/Co) mortality was 13.7% (11.1%, 16.8%) (p=0.048). This unadjusted dose-response relationship with IgG was also observed in thirty-day mortality (p=0.021). The pooled relative risk of mortality among patients transfused with high antibody level plasma units was 0.65 [0.47-0.92] for 7 days and 0.77 [0.63-0.94] for 30 days compared to low antibody level plasma units. Conclusions and Relevance: The relationships between reduced mortality and both earlier time to transfusion and higher antibody levels provide signatures of efficacy for convalescent plasma in the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. This information may be informative for the treatment of COVID-19 and design of randomized clinical trials involving convalescent plasma.

Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were restricted to remain confined at home, and medical visits were cancelled for 3 months. The impact of this lockdown on the manifestations of COPD and the quality-of-life of these patients has not been explored. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred patients with COPD were interviewed by telephone from May 2–18, 2020. The interviews included questions about the lockdown, missed medical appointments, fears of the disease, possible COVID-19 infection, and exacerbations of COPD suffered during this period and their management. In addition, the COPD Assessment Test, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression, and the 5-Dimension Euro Quality-of-Life questionnaires were administered. RESULTS: Sixty-four (64%) patients claimed to have strictly complied with the lockdown, and only 42 (42%) stated they had left home at least once during lockdown. Only one patient (1%) was hospitalized due to COVID-19, and 13 (13%) patients presented an exacerbation of COPD self-managed at home with no admissions due to exacerbation of COPD during this period. A medical consultation or complementary test was cancelled in 90% of the patients, but 61% had a medical telephone visit with a high degree of satisfaction (mean 9.3/10). Most patients declared that their feeling regarding lung disease and general health was similar or even better during lockdown (82% and 81%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that in general lockdown had a low impact on COPD patients. Only one patient was affected by COVID-19, but moderate exacerbations of COPD were not infrequent. Although many medical visits and test were cancelled, patients were very satisfied with the medical telephone visits.","Pleguezuelos, Eulogio; Del Carmen, Amin; Moreno, Eva; Ortega, Pilar; Vila, Xavier; Ovejero, Laura; Serra-Prat, Mateu; Palomera, Elisabet; Garnacho-Castaño, Manuel Vicente; Loeb, Eduardo; Farago, Georgina; Miravitlles, Marc",Int J Chron Obstruct Pulmon Dis,279,17

Not only has the pandemic completely overwhelmed some health systems but it has also changed how scientific evidence is shared and increased the pace at which such evidence is published and consumed, by scientists, policymakers and the wider public. More significantly, the pandemic has created tremendous challenges for decision-makers, who have had to implement highly disruptive containment measures with very little empirical scientific evidence to support their decision-making process. Given this lack of data, predictive mathematical models have played an increasingly prominent role. In high-income countries, there is a long-standing history of established research groups advising policymakers, whereas a general lack of translational capacity has meant that mathematical models frequently remain inaccessible to policymakers in low-income and middle-income countries. Here, we describe a participatory approach to modelling that aims to circumvent this gap. Our approach involved the creation of an international group of infectious disease modellers and other public health experts, which culminated in the establishment of the COVID-19 Modelling (CoMo) Consortium. Here, we describe how the consortium was formed, the way it functions, the mathematical model used and, crucially, the high degree of engagement fostered between CoMo Consortium members and their respective local policymakers and ministries of health.","Aguas, Ricardo; White, Lisa; Hupert, Nathaniel; Shretta, Rima; Pan-Ngum, Wirichada; Celhay, Olivier; Moldokmatova, Ainura; Arifi, Fatima; Mirzazadeh, Ali; Sharifi, Hamid; Adib, Keyrellous; Sahak, Mohammad Nadir; Franco, Caroline; Coutinho, Renato",BMJ Glob Health,279,26

Limitations of the gold standard qRT-PCR for diagnosis of this infection includes need for expensive equipment, specialized molecular laboratory, and experienced staff. Currently, CRISPR-based diagnostic method was approved by the U.S. FDA for rapid detection. Several studies developed SARS-CoV-2 detection based on CRISPR-Cas12a platform; however, the validations with RNA extracted from clinical specimens were limited. Therefore, this study evaluated the clinical performance of previously described CRISPR-Cas12a based diagnostic assays for SARS-CoV-2. According to the results, the CRISPR-Cas12a assays on N1 and S genes provided diagnostic accuracy (≥ 95 %) comparable to the qRT-PCR results. The assays with E, N2 and S genes yielded acceptable sensitivity of detection (≥ 95 %) whereas N1 and S genes provided outstanding specificity of detection (100 %). Preferably, multiple target genes should be detected by using CRISPR-Cas12a to ensure the most effective SARS-CoV-2 detection. Therefore, the N1 and S genes would be attractive target genes for SARS-CoV-2 detection based on CRISPR-Cas12a.","Nimsamer, Pattaraporn; Mayuramart, Oraphan; Rattanaburi, Somruthai; Chantaravisoot, Naphat; Saengchoowong, Suthat; Puenpa, Jiratchaya; Poovorawan, Yong; Payungporn, Sunchai",J Virol Methods,279,16

Mentoring may have mediating effects by enhancing social support. The University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) offers a voluntary general mentoring program (g-mentoring) for all interested students and a mentoring program for students with excellent course results and scientific interest (e-mentoring) We aimed to investigate the mental burden and views of their study situation during COVID-19 among students who did or did not participate in one of the formal mentoring programs. Method: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey (May 2020) examining students’ mental burden using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4), and assessing their perception of study conditions and digital teaching using self-developed items. Results: Of 1193 invited students, 543 (45.5%) completed the survey. 35% of those participated in the g-mentoring and 7% in the e-mentoring. 59% did not participate in any program. More e-mentees than g-mentees and nonparticipants reported clinically unproblematic levels of anxiety and depression symptoms. The majority of students (55%) was somewhat worried about the impact of the pandemic on their study situation. Regarding digital teaching students did not feel overburdened by the lack of a fixed schedule and structure, e-mentees even less than g-mentees and nonparticipants. Both g-mentees and nonparticipants were significantly more appreciative of the possible repeated use of the digital teaching materials than e-mentees (both groups M=5.7 vs. M=5.4 in e-mentees, p=.045). Conclusion: The results indicate that while students feel substantially burdened by the situation and the majority worries about the impact of the pandemic on their studies, they also seem to cope well with the digital course format. Study motivation during COVID-19 decreased among the majority of students with and without mentoring. These aspects may be important to address by medical schools interested in developing effective interventions to support students during a pandemic and continuous online teaching.","Guse, Jennifer; Heinen, Ines; Kurre, Jana; Mohr, Sonja; Bergelt, Corinna",GMS J Med Educ,279,8

Due to unprecedented shortages in N95 respirators, many healthcare systems have explored reprocessing of N95 respirators. Data supporting these approaches are lacking in real hospital settings. In particular, published studies have not yet reported an evaluation of multiple viruses, bacteria, and fungi along with respirator filtration and fit in a single, full-scale study. Objective: We initiated a full-scale study to evaluate different N95 FFR decontamination strategies and their impact on respirator integrity and inactivating multiple microorganisms, with experimental conditions informed by the needs and constraints of the hospital. Methods: We explored several reprocessing methods using new 3MTM 1860 N95 respirators, including dry (<10% relative humidity) and moist (62-66% relative humidity) heat (80-82 oC) in the drying cycle of industrial instrument washers, ethylene oxide (EtO), pulsed xenon UV (UV-PX), hydrogen peroxide gas plasma (HPGP), and vaporous hydrogen peroxide (VHP). Respirator samples were treated and analyzed for biological indicator inactivation using four viruses (MS2, phi6, influenza A virus, murine hepatitis virus), three bacteria (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Geobacillus stearothermophilus), and the fungus Aspergillus niger. The impact of different application media was also evaluated. In parallel, decontaminated respirators were evaluated for filtration integrity and fit. Results: VHP resulted in >2 log10 inactivation of all tested biological indicators. The combination of UV-PX + moist heat resulted in >2 log10 inactivation of all biological indicators except G. stearothermohphilus. Greater than 95% filtration efficiency was maintained following 2 (UV-PX + <10% relative humidity heat) or 10 (VHP) cycles of treatment, and proper fit was also preserved. UV-PX + dry heat was insufficient to inactivate all biological indicators. Although very effective at virus decontamination, HPGP resulted in decreased filtration efficiency after 3 cycles, and EtO treatment raised potential toxicity concerns. The observed inactivation of viruses with UV-PX, heat, and hydrogen peroxide treatments varied as a function of which culture media (PBS buffer or DMEM) they were deposited in. Conclusions and Relevance: High levels of biological indicator inactivation were achieved following treatment with either moist heat or VHP. These same treatments did not significantly impact mask filtration or fit. Hospitals have a variety of scalable options to safely reprocess N95 masks. Beyond value in the current Covid-19 pandemic, the broad group of microorganisms and conditions tested make these results relevant in potential future pandemic scenarios.","Wigginton, K. R.; Arts, P.

Cases of cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) have been reported in adenovirus vector-based COVID-19 vaccine recipients. FINDINGS: We reviewed all vaccine related CVT published cases by April 30, 2021. We assessed demographic, clinical variables and the interval between the vaccination and onset of headache. We assessed whether the presence of headache was associated with higher probability of death or intracranial hemorrhage. We identified 77 cases of CVT after COVID-19 vaccination. Patients’ age was below 60 years in 74/77 (95.8%) cases and 61/68 (89.7%) were women. Headache was described in 38/77 (49.4%) cases, and in 35/38 (92.1%) was associated with other symptoms. Multiple organ thrombosis was reported in 19/77 (24.7%) cases, intracranial hemorrhage in 33/77 (42.9%) cases and 19/77 (24.7%) patients died. The median time between vaccination and CVT-related headache onset was 8 (interquartile range 7.0–9.7) days. The presence of headache was associated with a higher odd of intracranial hemorrhage (OR 7.4; 95% CI: 2.7–20.8, p < 0.001), but not with death (OR: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.18–1.47, p = 0.213). CONCLUSION: Delayed onset of headache following an adenovirus vector-based COVID-19 vaccine is associated with development of CVT. Patients with new-onset headache, 1 week after vaccination with an adenovirus vector-based vaccine, should receive a thorough clinical evaluation and CVT must be ruled out.

Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), as the PED causative agent, has been commonly propagated and investigated in Vero cells, as well as in IPEC-J2, a porcine epithelial cell-jejunum 2. However, Vero cells, which are defective in interferon production, cannot represent the host response in enteric cells while PEDV replicates poorly in IPEC-J2 cells. In this study, we observed that rat crypt epithelial cells (IEC-6) were highly susceptible to different subtypes of PEDV. The replication kinetics of PEDV in IEC-6 cells is similar to that in Vero cells, but it is much higher than in IPEC-J2 cells. Besides that, PEDV infection in IEC-6 cells can induce the production of inflammatory cytokines and interferon, especially the type III IFNs. Collectively, our findings suggest that IEC-6 is an ideal cell line for PEDV replication and immune response studies.","Chen, Jianing; Cui, Yaru; Wang, Zemei; Liu, Guangliang",Vet Microbiol,279,11

Strikingly, men account for the majority of COVID-19 deaths, with current figures ranging from 59% to 75% of total mortality. However, despite clear implications in relation to COVID-19 mortality, most research has not considered sex as a critical factor in data analysis. Here, we highlight fundamental biological differences that exist between males and females, and how these may make significant contributions to the male-biased COVID-19 mortality. We present preclinical evidence identifying the influence of biological sex on the expression and regulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the main receptor used by SARS-CoV-2 to enter cells. However, we note that there is a lack of reports showing that sexual dimorphism of ACE2 expression exists and is of functional relevance in humans. In contrast, there is strong evidence, especially in the context of viral infections, that sexual dimorphism plays a central role in the genetic and hormonal regulation of immune responses, both of the innate and the adaptive immune system. We review evidence supporting that ineffective anti-SARS-CoV-2 responses, coupled with a predisposition for inappropriate hyperinflammatory responses, could provide a biological explanation for the male bias in COVID-19 mortality. A prominent finding in COVID-19 is the increased risk of death with pre-existing cardiovascular comorbidities, such as hypertension, obesity, and age. We contextualize how important features of sexual dimorphism and inflammation in COVID-19 may exhibit a reciprocal relationship with comorbidities, and explain their increased mortality risk. Ultimately, we demonstrate that biological sex is a fundamental variable of critical relevance to our mechanistic understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the pursuit of effective COVID-19 preventative and therapeutic strategies.","Bienvenu, Laura A; Noonan, Jonathan; Wang, Xiaowei; Peter, Karlheinz",Cardiovasc Res,279,27

Pathological examination of rats infected with variants cl-2, DL and sp-4 showed that the cl-2 and DL induced severe and mild acute encephalomyelitis, respectively, while no lesions were observed in the central nervous system of rats infected with sp-4. Virus growth and distribution of antigen in rat brains correlated strongly with neurovirulence. These results suggest that S protein plays a role in neurovirulence in rats.

Treatment for vitiligo remains a challenge for dermatologists; thus, it is frustrating both for physicians and patients. The objective of this study was to evaluate a combination treatment characterized by the use of a leukocyte-rich platelet-rich plasma, which is particularly rich in monocytes (defined here as monocyte-rich PRP), in combination with a 1927 nm fraxel laser and a 308 nm excimer laser. Materials and Methods: Treatment with monocyte-rich PRP combined with 1927 nm fraxel laser and 308 nm excimer laser was performed in nine sessions in 80 days and the median follow-up of the patients was 10 months. A total of 27 Caucasian patients were included in the present study. The median age of patients was 41 years, ranging between 20 and 69 years. Results: A re-pigmentation occurred in 16 cases (59%) with a reduction of the Vitiligo Extent Score (VES) and absence of re-pigmentation in untreated areas. Performing a rank correlation between VES and re-pigmentation in the treated areas, we found that there was a significant correlation (p < 0.0001). The presence of progressive vitiligo (p = 0.1) and the anatomic areas (p = 0.1) did not influence the treatment. Untreated areas did not show any improvement of the depigmented lesions, except in one case (p < 0.0001).

We provided a comprehensive view of viral mutations from a time- and age-representative sampling from May to October 2020, in Esteio (RS, Brazil), highlighting two frequent mutations in Spike glycoprotein (D614G and V1176F), an emergent mutation (E484K) in Spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) characteristic of the South African lineage B.1.351, and the adjacent replacement of 2 amino acids in Nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (R203K and G204R). A significant viral diversity was evidenced with the identification of 80 different SNPs. The E484K replacement was found in two genomes (9.5%) from samples obtained in mid-October, which is to our best knowledge the earliest description of E484K harboring SARS-CoV-2 in South Brazil. This mutation identified in a small municipality from the RS state demonstrates that it was probably widely distributed in the Brazilian territory, but went unnoticed so far by the lack of genomic surveillance in Brazil. The introduction of E484K mutants shows temporal correlation with later increases in new cases in our state. Importantly, since it has been associated with immune evasion and enhanced interaction with hACE-2, lineages containing this substitution must be the subject of intense surveillance. Our date demonstrates multiple introductions of the most prevalent lineages (B.1.1.33 and B.1.1.248) and the major role of community transmission in viral spreading and the establishment of Brazilian lineages. This represents an important contribution to the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2.","Franceschi, V. B.; Caldana, G. D.; Mayer, A. d. M.; Cybis, G. B.; Neves, C. A. M.; Ferrareze, P. A.

Since vaccines and therapies are still not available for the population, prevention becomes desperately needed. One important aspect for prevention is the identification and subsequent isolation of contagious specimens. The currently used methods for diagnostics are time consuming and also hindered by the limited availability of reagents and reaction costs, thus presenting a bottle neck for prevention of COVID-19 spread. Here, we present a new ultra-fast test method which is ten times faster than conventional diagnostic tests using real time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). In addition, this ultra-fast method is easy to handle as well as cost effective. We translated published SARS-CoV-2 testing protocols from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, Georgia, USA) and the Charite Berlin (Germany) to the NEXTGENPCR (NGPCR) machine and combined it with a fluorescence-based endpoint measurement. Fluorescence was measured with a commercial blue light scanner. We confirmed the NEXTGENPCR results with commercially available positive controls. In addition, we isolated RNA from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients and achieved similar results to clinical RT-qPCR assays. Here, we could show correlation between the results obtained by NEXTGENPCR and conventional RT-qPCR.","Asghari, E.; HoÌving, A.; van Heijningen, P.; Kiel, A.; Kralemann-KoÌhler, A.; LuÌtkemeyer, M.; Storm, J.; Vollmer, T.; Knabbe, C.; Kaltschmidt, B.; de Vos, G.; Kaltschmidt, C.",,279,24

One hundred and sixteen people (over 18 years old) completed an online survey between May and June 2020. Two independent researchers ran inductive thematic content analysis on data using a specifically developed international codebook. Five major themes were identified in the participants’ narrations: difficulties, emotions, coping with lockdown measures, going back to normal, and change. The results, interpreted within the PCT transitions, showed that the pandemic represented a threat to participants’ life plans, beliefs, and certainties. Some coped with it mainly by waiting for the pandemic to end and remaining firm in their beliefs and certainties, whereas others coped by trying to find alternative ways of giving sense to this experience and reconstructing personal meanings, claiming a change in their life and in society.

In response, many laboratories have redirected attention to SARS-CoV-2, meaning there is an urgent need for tools that can be used in laboratories unaccustomed to working with coronaviruses. Here we report a range of tools for SARS-CoV-2 research. First, we describe a facile single plasmid SARS-CoV-2 reverse genetics system that is simple to genetically manipulate and can be used to rescue infectious virus through transient transfection (without in vitro transcription or additional expression plasmids). The rescue system is accompanied by our panel of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (against nearly every viral protein), SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolates, and SARS-CoV-2 permissive cell lines, which are all openly available to the scientific community. Using these tools, we demonstrate here that the controversial ORF10 protein is expressed in infected cells. Furthermore, we show that the promising repurposed antiviral activity of apilimod is dependent on TMPRSS2 expression. Altogether, our SARS-CoV-2 toolkit, which can be directly accessed via our website at https://mrcppu-covid.bio/, constitutes a resource with considerable potential to advance COVID-19 vaccine design, drug testing, and discovery science.","Rihn, Suzannah J.; Merits, Andres; Bakshi, Siddharth; Turnbull, Matthew L.; Wickenhagen, Arthur; Alexander, Akira J.

We aim to gain a fuller understanding of the influence team leaders, interpersonal relationships and individual characteristics have on individuals' psychological safety and their decisions to engage in voice or silence behavior. Thirty-four interviews were conducted with healthcare professionals from across five teams working within an acute, suburban hospital.

In pediatric age, the majority of patients is asymptomatic; however, several neurological manifestations associated with Sars-CoV-2 infection have been detected in a percentage of cases ranging from 17.3 to 36.4%. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) has been recently included among the potential complications of Sars-Cov2 infection. The available data regarding pediatric patient show only one case. CASE REPORT: We present a case regarding a 6-year-old patient suffering from Fisher-Evans syndrome who was given sirolimus and thalidomide therapy. After 10 days since the first positive nasopharyngeal swab for Sars-CoV-2, in which he had no symptoms, he presented an episode of generalized tonic-clonic seizure with spontaneous resolution. The patient underwent MRI which showed the typical picture of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. His clinical course was favorable, with a good response to cortisone therapy and a progressive improvement of the neuroradiological and electroencephalographic picture. CONCLUSIONS: According to our knowledge, this is the second case of an acute disseminated encephalomyelitis following SARS-CoV-2 infection in a pediatric patient, characterized by monosymptomatic onset, in which the immunosuppressive therapy practiced for the Fisher-Evans syndrome has probably contributed to a favorable evolution of ADEM, in contrast to other case described in the literature.","Manzo, Maria Laura; Galati, Cristina; Gallo, Cristina; Santangelo, Giuseppe; Marino, Antonio; Guccione, Fulvio; Pitino, Renata; Raieli, Vincenzo",Neurol Sci,279,22

Being able to analyse and predict the spread of this epidemic-causing disease is hence of utmost importance now, especially as it would help in the reasoning behind important decisions drastically affecting countries and their people, as well as in ensuring efficient resource and utility management. However, the needs of the people and specific conditions of the spread are varying widely from country to country. Hence, this article has two fold objectives: (i) conduct an in-depth statistical analysis of COVID-19 affected patients in India, (ii) propose a mathematical model for the prediction of spread of COVID-19 cases in India. MATERIALS AND METHOD: There has been limited research in modeling and predicting the spread of COVID-19 in India, owing both to the ongoing nature of the pandemic and limited availability of data. Currently famous SIR and non-SIR based Gauss-error-function and Monte Carlo simulation models do not perform well in the context of COVID-19 spread in India. We propose a ‘change-factor’ or ‘rate-of-change’ based mathematical model to predict the spread of the pandemic in India, with data drawn from hundreds of sources. RESULTS: Average age of affected patients was found to be 38.54 years, with 66.76% males, and 33.24% females. Most patients were in the age range of 18 to 40 years. Optimal parameter values of the prediction model are identified (α = 1.35, N = 3 and T = 10) by extensive experiments. Over the entire course of time since the outbreak started in India, the model has been 90.36% accurate in predicting the total number of cases the next day, correctly predicting the range in 150 out of the 166 days looked at. CONCLUSION: The proposed system showed an accuracy of 90.36% for prediction since the first COVID-19 case in India, and 96.67% accuracy over the month of April. Predicted number of cases for the next day is found to be a function of the numbers over the last 3 days, but with an ‘increase’ factor influenced by the last 10 days. It is noticed that males are affected more than females. It is also noticed that in India, the number of people in each age bucket is steadily decreasing, with the largest number of adults infected being the youngest ones—a departure from the world trend. The model is self-correcting as it improves its predictions every day, by incorporating the previous day's data into the trend-line for the following days. This model can thus be used dynamically not only to predict the spread of COVID-19 in India, but also to check the effect of various government measures in a short span of time after they are implemented.","Ghosh, Shinjini",Int J Med Inform,279,20

Both the two viruses belong to the Pneumoviridae family and show overlapping clinical, epidemiological and transmission features. However, it is unknown whether these two viruses have similar geographic spread patterns which may inform designing and evaluating their epidemic control measures. METHODS: We conducted comparative phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses to explore the spatial-temporal patterns of HMPV and RSV across Africa using 232 HMPV and 842 RSV attachment (G) glycoprotein gene sequences obtained from 5 countries (The Gambia, Zambia, Mali, South Africa, and Kenya) between August 2011 and January 2014. RESULTS: Phylogeographic analyses found frequently similar patterns of spread of RSV and HMPV. Viral sequences commonly clustered by region, i.e., West Africa (Mali, Gambia), East Africa (Kenya) and Southern Africa (Zambia, South Africa), and similar genotype dominance patterns were observed between neighbouring countries. Both HMPV and RSV country epidemics were characterized by co-circulation of multiple genotypes. Sequences from different African sub-regions (East, West and Southern Africa) fell into separate clusters interspersed with sequences from other countries globally. CONCLUSION: The spatial clustering patterns of viral sequences and genotype dominance patterns observed in our analysis suggests strong regional links and predominant local transmission. The geographical clustering further suggests independent introduction of HMPV and RSV variants in Africa from the global pool, and local regional diversification.

However, there are limited prospectively-collected data on assay performance, and minimal clinical information to guide interpretation of discrepant results. METHODS: Over a two-week period, 1080 consecutive plasma samples submitted for clinical SARS-CoV-2 IgG testing were tested in parallel for anti-nucleocapsid IgG (anti-N, Abbott) and anti-spike IgG (anti-S1, EUROIMMUN). Chart review was conducted for samples testing positive or borderline on either assay, and for an age/sex-matched cohort of samples negative by both assays. CDC surveillance case definitions were used to determine clinical sensitivity/specificity and conduct receiver operating characteristics curve analysis. RESULTS: There were 52 samples positive by both methods, 2 positive for anti-N only, 34 positive for anti-S1 only, and 27 borderline for anti-S1. Of the 34 individuals positive for anti-S1 alone, 8 (24%) had confirmed COVID-19. No anti-S1 borderline cases were positive for anti-N or had confirmed/probable COVID-19. The anti-N assay was less sensitive (84.2% [95% CI 72.1-92.5%] versus 94.7% [95% CI 85.4-98.9%]) but more specific (99.2% [95% CI 95.5-100%] versus 86.9% [95% CI 79.6-92.3%]) than anti-S1. Abbott anti-N sensitivity could be improved to 96.5% with minimal effect on specificity if the index threshold was lowered from 1.4 to 0.6. CONCLUSION: Real-world concordance between different serologic assays may be lower than previously described in retrospective studies. These findings have implications for the interpretation of SARS-CoV-2 IgG results, especially with the advent of spike antigen-targeted vaccination, as a subset of patients with true infection are anti-N negative and anti-S1 positive.","Wang, Hannah; Wiredja, Danica; Yang, Lu; Bulterys, Philip L; Costales, Cristina; Röltgen, Katharina; Manalac, Justin; Yee, Jennifer; Zehnder, James; Shi, Run Zhang; Boyd, Scott D; Pinsky, Benjamin A",Clin Chem,279,24

Here, we leverage the genetically diverse Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse resource to better understand how chronic infection by Theiler’s Murine Encephalomyelitis Virus (TMEV) elicits diverse clinical and morphologic changes in the central nervous system (CNS). We characterized the TMEV-induced clinical phenotype responses, and associated lesion distributions in the CNS, in six CC mouse strains over a 90 day infection period. We observed varying degrees of motor impairment in these strains, as measured by delayed righting reflex, paresis, paralysis, seizures, limb clasping, ruffling, and encephalitis phenotypes. All strains developed neuroparenchymal necrosis and mineralization in the brain, primarily localized to the hippocampal regions. Two of the six strains presented with axonal degeneration with myelin loss of the nerve roots in the lumbar spinal cord. Moreover, we statistically correlated lesion distribution with overall frequencies of clinical phenotypes and phenotype progression to better understand how and where TMEV targets the CNS, based on genetic background. Specifically, we assessed lesion distribution in relation to the clinical progression of these phenotypes from early to late TMEV disease, finding significant relationships between progression and lesion distribution. Finally, we identified quantitative trait loci associated with frequency of lesions in a particular brain region, revealing several loci of interest for future study: lysosomal trafficking regulator (Lyst) and nidogen 1 (Nid1). Together, these results indicate that the genetic background influences the type and severity of clinical phenotypes, phenotypic resilience to TMEV, and the lesion distribution across strains.","Lawley, Koedi S.; Rech, Raquel R.; Elenwa, Faith; Han, Gang; Perez Gomez, Aracely A.; Amstalden, Katia; Welsh, C.

Methods: A semi-quantitative questionnaire was developed covering the organisation of agency, biosimilar development criteria and marketing authorisation process and sent to seven regulatory agencies covering the BRICS-TM countries. All data was kept anonymous and confidential. Data processing and analysis was carried out; descriptive statistics were used for quantitative data and content analysis was employed to generate themes for qualitative data. Results: Out of the seven regulatory agencies included in the study, six representatives provided the responses. The perspectives of these six regulatory agencies varied on a number of aspects relating to the review criteria for biosimilar development and licencing process. The most prevalent model for data assessment is the “full review” of a marketing authorisation application. There is lack of a standard approach across the agencies on sourcing of the reference biological product, in vivo toxicity studies and confirmatory clinical studies. Most agencies restrict interaction with biosimilar developers and any scientific advice is non-binding. The marketing authorisation approval depends on scientific assessment of the dossier, sample analysis and GMP certification. The agencies do not issue any public assessment report specifying the summary basis of biosimilar approval. Conclusion: Regulatory agencies across the six emerging economies are steadily improving the regulatory mechanism in the area of biosimilars. However, there remains scope for increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of the processes by encouraging open and transparent interaction with developers, adopting a flexible approach toward accepting advanced analytical data in lieu of clinical studies and enhancing regulatory reliance amongst agencies. This will help to simplify the new biosimilar development programmes and make them more cost-effective.","Rahalkar, Hasumati; Sheppard, Alan; Santos, Gustavo Mendes Lima; Dasgupta, Chitralekha; Perez-Tapia, Sonia Mayra; Lopez-Morales, Carlos A.; Salek, Sam",Front Med (Lausanne),279,8

This was first investigated in a pilot study and is now confirmed in a large patient cohort of 633 patients. It was investigated whether CPR, LBR and time-to-pregnancy could be improved by analyzing the gene expression profile of three predictive genes in the cumulus cells, compared to patients with morphology-based embryo selection only. METHODS: A large interventional, non-randomized, assessor-blinded cohort study with 633 ICSI patients was conducted in a tertiary fertility center. Non-PCOS patients, 22–39 years old, with good ovarian reserve, were stimulated with HP-hMG using a GnRH antagonist protocol and planned for fresh Day 3 eSET. The cumulus cells from individually denuded oocytes were ranked by a lab-developed cumulus cell test: qRT-PCR for three predictive genes (CAMK1D, EFNB2 and SASH1) and two control genes (UBC, B2M). The embryo selected for transfer was highest ranked from the pool of morphologically transferable Day 3 embryos. Patients in the control (n = 520) and experimental arm (n = 113) were compared for clinical pregnancy and live birth, using a weighted generalized linear model, and time-to-pregnancy using Kaplan-Meier curves. RESULTS: The CPR was 61% in the experimental arm (n = 113) vs 29% in the control arm (n = 520, p < 0.0001). The LBR in the experimental arm (50%) was significantly higher than in the control arm (27%,p < 0.0001). Time-to-pregnancy was significantly shortened by 3 transfer cycles independent of the number of embryos available on Day 3 (Kaplan-Meier, p < 0.0001). Cumulus cell tested patients < 35 years (n = 65) or ≥ 35 years (n = 48) had a CPR of 62 and 60% respectively (ns). For cumulus cell tested patients with 2, 3–4, or > 4 transferable embryos, the CPR was 66, 52, and 67% (ns) respectively, and thus independent of the number of transferable embryos on Day 3. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides further evidence of the clinical usefulness of the non-invasive cumulus cell test over time in a larger patient cohort.

SARS-CoV-2 binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor is a critical step mediate virus entry into target cells. Articles have alluded that the level of ACE2 gene expression in adipose tissue is higher than lung tissue, but a PubMed search found no results in articles to demonstrate this. The aim of this study was to investigate ACE2 gene expression in adipose tissue and lung tissue using a public database. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A search of a public gene expression database to investigate ACE2 gene expression in human tissues. RESULTS: ACE2 gene expression was present in both visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissues. The gene expression profile demonstrated that ACE2 gene expression was higher in human visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissues than human lung tissue. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that ACE2 gene expression is higher in visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue than that in lung tissue, a major target tissue affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection. This suggests a mechanism by which excess adiposity may drive greater infection severity in patients with COVID-19.","Al-Benna, Sammy",Obes Med,279,1

The programme monitors those with an aneurysm, and early intervention for large aneurysms reduces ruptures and AAA-related mortality. AAA screening services have been disrupted following COVID-19 but it is not known how this may impact AAA-related mortality, or where efforts should be focussed as services resume. METHODS: We repurposed a previously validated discrete event simulation model to investigate the impact of COVID-19-related service disruption on key outcomes. This model was used to explore the impact of delayed invitation and reduced attendance in men invited to screening. Additionally, we investigated the impact of temporarily suspending scans, increasing the threshold for elective surgery to 7cm and increasing drop-out in the AAA cohort under surveillance, using data from NAAASP to inform the population. FINDINGS: Delaying invitation to primary screening up to two years had little impact on key outcomes whereas a 10% reduction in attendance could lead to a 2% lifetime increase in AAA-related deaths. In surveillance patients, a 1-year suspension of surveillance or increase in the elective threshold resulted in a 0.4% increase in excess AAA-related deaths (8% in those 5–5.4cm at the start). Longer suspensions or a doubling of drop-out from surveillance would have a pronounced impact on outcomes. INTERPRETATION: Efforts should be directed towards encouraging men to attend AAA screening service appointments post-COVID-19. Those with AAAs on surveillance should be prioritised as the screening programme resumes, as changes to these services beyond one year are likely to have a larger impact on surgical burden and AAA-related mortality.","Kim, Lois G.; Sweeting, Michael J.; Armer, Morag; Jacomelli, Jo; Nasim, Akhtar; Harrison, Seamus C.",PLoS One,279,4

While hundreds of reinfections have reported only a few have been confirmed. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of the viral isolates from the different episodes is mandatory to establish reinfection. Methods: Nasopharyngeal (NP), oropharyngeal (OP) and whole blood (WB) samples were collected from paired samples of four individuals who were suspected of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection based on distinct clinical episodes and RT-PCR tests. Details from their case record files and investigations were documented. RNA was extracted from the NP and OP samples and subjected to WGS, and the nucleotide and amino acid sequences were subjected to genome and protein-based functional annotation analyses. Serial serology was performed for Anti-N IgG, Anti- S1 RBD IgG, and sVNT (surrogate virus neutralizing test). Findings: Three patients were more symptomatic with lower Ct values and longer duration of illness. Seroconversion was detected soon after the second episode in three patients. WGS generated a genome coverage ranging from 80.07 to 99.7%. Phylogenetic analysis revealed sequences belonged to G, GR and “Other” clades. A total of 42mutations were identified in all the samples, consisting of 22 non-synonymous, 17 synonymous, two in upstream, and one in downstream regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Comparative genomic and protein-based annotation analyses revealed differences in the presence and absence of specific mutations in the virus sequences from the two episodes in all four paired samples. Interpretation: Based on the criteria of genome variations identified by whole genome sequencing and supported by clinical presentation, molecular and serological tests, we were able to confirm reinfections in two patients, provide weak evidence of reinfection in the third patient and unable to rule out a prolonged infection in the fourth. This study emphasizes the importance of detailed analyses of clinical and serological information as well as the virus's genomic variations while assessing cases of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection.","Shastri, Jayanthi; Parikh, Swapneil; Agrawal, Sachee; Chatterjee, Nirjhar; Pathak, Manish; Chaudhary, Sakshi; Sharma, Chetan; Kanakan, Akshay; A, Vivekanand; Srinivasa Vasudevan, Janani; Maurya, Ranjeet; Fatihi, Saman; Thukral, Lipi; Agrawal, Anurag; Pinto, Lancelot; Pandey, Rajesh; Sunil, Sujatha",Front Med (Lausanne),279,1

OBJECTIVES: Provide evidence on the effect of implementation of rapid molecular diagnostics for viruses on use of in-hospital isolation facilities, oseltamivir and antibiotic usage, and other clinical outcomes in immunocompromised patients. STUDY DESIGN: A before-after study during two consecutive respiratory viral seasons, including immunocompromised adult patients presenting at a tertiary care emergency department with clinical suspicion of RTI. During the first season (2016/2017), respiratory viruses were detected using inhouse real-time PCR. The second season (2017/2018), we implemented a diagnostic flowchart including a rapid molecular test for 15 respiratory viruses (FilmArray®). We assessed the effect of this implementation on need for isolation, antivirals and empirical antibiotics. RESULTS: We included 192 immunocompromised adult patients during the first and 378 during the second season. Respiratory viral testing was performed in 135 patients (70%) during the first and 284 (75%) during the second season (p = 0.218) of which 213 (75%) using the rapid test. After implementation, use of in-hospital isolation facilities was reduced (adjusted odds ratio 0.35, 95%CI 0.19-0.64). Furthermore, adequate use of oseltamivir improved, with fewer prescriptions in influenza negative patients (0.15, 95%CI 0.08-0.28) and more in influenza positive patients (11.13, 95%CI 1.75–70.86). No effect was observed on empirical antibiotic use, hospital admissions, length of hospital stay or safety outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of rapid molecular testing for respiratory viruses in adult immunocompromised patients results in more adequate use of oseltamivir and in-hospital isolation facilities without compromising safety.","Vos, Laura M.; Weehuizen, Jesper M.; Hoepelman, Andy I.M.; Kaasjager, Karin H.A.H.; Riezebos-Brilman, Annelies; Oosterheert, Jan Jelrik",J Clin Virol,279,24

Consequently, visuality and social media platforms like Twitter have come to play a vital role in disseminating prevention messages widely. Yet to date, only little is known about what characterizes visual risk communication during the Covid-19 pandemic. To address this gap in the literature, this study’s objective was to determine how visual risk communication was used on Twitter to promote the World Health Organisations (WHO) recommended preventative behaviours and how this communication changed over time. METHODS: We sourced Twitter’s 500 most retweeted Covid-19 messages for each month from January–October 2020 using Crowdbreaks. For inclusion, tweets had to have visuals, be in English, come from verified accounts, and contain one of the keywords ‘covid19’, ‘coronavirus’, ‘corona’, or ‘covid’. Following a retrospective approach, we then performed a qualitative content analysis of the 616 tweets meeting inclusion criteria. RESULTS: Our results show communication dynamics changed over the course of the pandemic. At the start, most retweeted preventative messages came from the media and health and government institutions, but overall, personal accounts with many followers (51.3%) predominated, and their tweets had the highest spread (10.0%, i.e., retweet count divided by followers). Messages used mostly photographs and images were found to be rich with information. 78.1% of Tweets contained 1–2 preventative messages, whereby ‘stay home’ and ‘wear a mask’ frequented most. Although more tweets used health loss framing, health gain messages spread more. CONCLUSION: Our findings can inform the didactics of future crisis communication. The results underscore the value of engaging individuals, particularly influencers, as advocates to spread health risk messages and promote solidarity. Further, our findings on the visual characteristic of the most retweeted tweets highlight factors that health and government organisations should consider when creating visual health messages for Twitter. However, that more tweets used the emotive medium of photographs often combined with health loss framing raises concerns about persuasive tactics. More research is needed to understand the implications of framing and its impact on public perceptions and behaviours.

In this study, we used 2‐D DIGE and MS to analyze the protein profiles of plasma from SARS patients, in the search for proteomic alterations associated with the disease progression, which could provide some clues to the pathogenesis. To enrich the low‐abundance proteins in human plasma, two highly abundant proteins, albumin and IgG, were first removed. By comparing the plasma proteins of SARS patients with those of a normal control group, several proteins with a significant alteration were found. The up‐regulated proteins were identified as alpha‐1 acid glycoprotein, haptoglobin, alpha‐1 anti‐chymotrypsin and fetuin. The down‐regulated proteins were apolipoprotein A‐I, transferrin and transthyretin. Most of the proteins showed significant changes (up‐ or down‐regulated) in the progressive phase of disease, and there was a trend back to normal level during the convalescent phase. Among these proteins, the alterations of fetuin and anti‐chymotrypsin were further confirmed by Western blotting. Since all the up‐regulated proteins identified above are well‐known inflammation inhibitors, these results strongly suggest that the body starts inflammation inhibition to sustain the inflammatory response balance in the progression of SARS.","Wan, Jia; Sun, Wei; Li, Xiaohai; Ying, Wantao; Dai, Jingquan; Kuai, Xuezhang; Wei, Handong; Gao, Xue; Zhu, Yunping; Jiang, Ying; Qian, Xiaohong; He, Fuchu",Proteomics,279,1

CBSI programs encourage older people to (1) take care of themselves and their peers, (2) sustain their well-being, and (3) create a cohesive and inclusive community. Although the emergence of CBSI programs is a global phenomenon, the variations, effectiveness, and sustainability of these programs are unknown. To uncover information about the Japanese version of CBSI programs, we conducted observations and face-to-face interviews with related personnel at two CBSI programs in rural areas of Japan in 2018. We found both positive and negative aspects in the current form of CBSI programs. As for the positives, these programs promote older people’s physical and psychological well-being and enhance community cohesiveness. However, CBSI programs face challenges, including that groups tend to be gender and age specific: men and the younger-old are less likely to show interest. A group-specific approach to CBSI programs could cause future community division, which would be contrary to the goal.

PAI-1 is the principal inhibitor of the plasminogen activators, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA). Turbulence in the levels of PAI-1 tilts the balance of the hemostatic system resulting in bleeding or thrombotic complications. Not surprisingly, there is strong evidence that documents the role of PAI-1 in cardiovascular disease. The more recent uncovering of the coalition between the hemostatic and inflammatory pathways has exposed a distinct role for PAI-1. The storm of proinflammatory cytokines liberated during inflammation, including IL-6 and TNF-α, directly influence PAI-1 synthesis and increase circulating levels of this serpin. Consequently, elevated levels of PAI-1 are commonplace during infection and are frequently associated with a hypofibrinolytic state and thrombotic complications. Elevated PAI-1 levels are also a feature of metabolic syndrome, which is defined by a cluster of abnormalities including obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and elevated triglyceride. Metabolic syndrome is in itself defined as a proinflammatory state associated with elevated levels of cytokines. In addition, insulin has a direct impact on PAI-1 synthesis bridging these pathways. This review describes the key physiological functions of PAI-1 and how these become perturbed during disease processes. We focus on the direct relationship between PAI-1 and inflammation and the repercussion in terms of an ensuing hypofibrinolytic state and thromboembolic complications.

However, issues on the datasets and study designs from medical and technical perspectives, as well as questions on the vulnerability and robustness of AI algorithms have emerged. In this study, we address these issues with a more realistic development of AI-driven COVID-19 pneumonia detection models by generating our own data through a retrospective clinical study to augment the dataset aggregated from external sources. We optimized five deep learning architectures, implemented development strategies by manipulating data distribution to quantitatively compare study designs, and introduced several detection scenarios to evaluate the robustness and diagnostic performance of the models. At the current level of data availability, the performance of the detection model depends on the hyperparameter tuning and has less dependency on the quantity of data.

Beside many other viruses (HHV-8, erythrovirus B19, hepatitis A and E viruses…), a special attention has been paid to emerging arbovirus diseases (West Nile virus infection, dengue, chikungunya) that threaten to occur in the French metropolitan area following the implantation in Europe of the mosquito Aedes albopictus, the main vector of dengue and chikungunya in temperate regions. Another blood-linked risk, notably in United Kingdom and France, is the prion agent responsible for the variant form of the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. The review is concluded by a brief overview of the measures aimed to control these emergences, including the exclusion of at-risk donors, the diagnostic tests able to detect a specific agent, the leukocyte reduction of labile blood products, and the physical or chemical treatments aiming the nonspecific inactivation of infectious agents potentially present in blood without impairing significantly the physiological properties of blood compounds. The ability to control prospectively the new viral risks linked to blood products is a challenge for the preservation of the confidence of both clinicians and receivers in the safety of blood transfusion.","Pozzetto, B.; Garraud, O.",Transfus Clin Biol,279,20

METHODS: A total of 3,527 Hong Kong Chinese adults were interviewed by telephone within the framework of six identical cross-sectional surveys carried out during the 28-month study period. Given a hypothetical scenario that two to three new human-to-human H5N1 cases had been reported in Hong Kong, the trends of the respondents in various H5N1-related risk perceptions, anticipated personal psychological responses, and anticipated personal preventive behaviors were investigated. RESULTS: Over time, a decreased proportion of the respondents (1) felt susceptible to contracting H5N1, (2) expected a large outbreak would eventually occur, (3) believed that the impacts of H5N1 were worse than those of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and (4) anticipated adopting more types of preventive measures and experiencing mental distress in the case of a small-scale outbreak in Hong Kong (AOR from 0.27 to 0.43, p < 0.001), but the public remained vigilant on public health behaviors, such as hand-washing. The prevalence of misconceptions on the mode of transmission declined, but remained high; perceptions on the fatality of H5N1 remained largely underestimated. The SARS experience and unconfirmed beliefs about the transmission modes were associated with variables on anticipated preventive behaviors and emotional distress. CONCLUSION: Starting in 2005 through to 2008, respondents perceived a decreasing level of susceptibility, severity, and anticipated stress towards a hypothetical human-to-human H5N1 outbreak, possibly due to the low efficiency of transmission. The public’s general preparedness was still relatively good and rational, even though individual preventive behaviors were less common. However, misconceptions were prevalent among the respondents. Based on these results, public education is warranted to rectify these misconceptions.","F. Lau, J. T.; Tsui, H. Y.; Kim, J. H.; Chan, P. K. S.; Griffiths, S.",Infection,279,24

The immune activities of the central nervous system are profoundly affected by peripheral immune activities. Immune tolerance refers to the unresponsiveness of the immune system to continuous or repeated stimulation to avoid excessive inflammation and unnecessary by-stander injury in the face of continuous antigen threat. It has been proved that the immune tolerance could suppress the development of various peripheral inflammation-related diseases. However, the role of immune tolerance in neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative diseases was not clear. METHODS: Rats were injected with repeated low-dose lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 0.3 mg/kg) intraperitoneally for 4 days to induce peripheral immune tolerance. Neuroinflammation was produced using intracranial LPS (15 μg) injection. Inflammation cytokines were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Microglial activation were measured using immunostaining of Iba-1 and ED-1. Dopaminergic neuronal damage was evaluated using immunochemistry staining and stereological counting of TH-positive neurons. Behavioral impairment was evaluated using amphetamine-induced rotational behavioral assessment. RESULTS: Compared with the non-immune tolerated animals, pre-treatment of peripheral immune tolerance significantly decreased the production of inflammatory cytokines, suppressed the microglial activation, and increased the number of dopaminergic neuronal survival in the substantia nigra. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that peripheral immune tolerance attenuated neuroinflammation and inhibited neuroinflammation-induced dopaminergic neuronal death.

Besides its role as a peptidase, APN also mediates signal transduction and is involved in the activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). MMPs function in tissue remodeling within the extracellular space and are therefore involved in many human diseases, such as fibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis, tumor angiogenesis, and metastasis, as well as viral infections. However, the exact mechanism that leads to APN-driven MMP activation is unclear. It was previously shown that extracellular 14-3-3 adapter proteins bind to APN and thereby induce the transcription of MMPs. As a first step, we sought to identify potential 14-3-3–binding sites in the APN sequence. We constructed a set of phosphorylated peptides derived from APN to probe for interactions. We identified and characterized a canonical 14-3-3–binding site (site 1) within the flexible, structurally unresolved N-terminal APN region using direct binding fluorescence polarization assays and thermodynamic analysis. In addition, we identified a secondary, noncanonical binding site (site 2), which enhances the binding affinity in combination with site 1 by many orders of magnitude. Finally, we solved crystal structures of 14-3-3σ bound to mono- and bis-phosphorylated APN-derived peptides, which revealed atomic details of the binding mode of mono- and bivalent 14-3-3 interactions. Therefore, our findings shed some light on the first steps of APN-mediated MMP activation and open the field for further investigation of this important signaling pathway.","Kiehstaller, Sebastian; Ottmann, Christian; Hennig, Sven",J Biol Chem,279,1

Finally, we show that GALNT family members capable of glycosylating S are expressed in human respiratory cells that are targets for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Therefore, it is currently considered as one of the most important global health problems of human societies and there is an urgent need for potent drugs or vaccines which can effectively combat this virus. The chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) of SARS-CoV-2 plays a key role in the viral replication inside the host and thus is a promising drug target to design and develop effective antiviral drugs against SARS and other coronaviruses. This study evaluated some antiviral coumarin phytochemicals as potential inhibitors of coronaviruses 3CLpro by in silico approaches such as molecular docking, ADMET prediction, molecular dynamics simulation, and MM-PBSA binding energy calculation. Natural coumarin derivatives were docked to the 3CLpro of SARS-CoV-2 and for further investigation, docked to the 3CLpro of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The docking scores of these natural compounds were compared with 3CLpro referenced inhibitors (ritonavir and lopinavir) and co-crystal inhibitor N3. Molecular docking studies suggested more than half of the coumarin phytochemicals had favorable interaction at the binding pocket of the coronaviruses 3CLpro and exhibited better binding affinities toward 3CLpro than ritonavir and lopinavir. Most antiviral phytochemicals interact strongly with one or both the catalytic dyad residues (His41 and Cys145) and the other key residues of SARS-CoV-2 main protease. Further, MD simulation and binding free energy calculations using MM-PBSA were carried out for three 3CLpro-coumarin complexes and 3CLpro-N3/lopinavir. The results confirmed that the 3CLpro-glycycoumarin, 3CLpro-oxypeucedanin hydrate, and 3CLpro-inophyllum P complexes were highly stable, experience fewer conformation fluctuations and share a similar degree of compactness. Also, the pharmacokinetics and drug-likeness studies showed good results for the selected coumarin phytochemicals.Therefore, the coumarin phytochemicals could be used as antiviral agents in the treatment of COVID-19 after further studies.

Despite this, some patients develop refractory hypoxemia and hypercapnia requiring venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV ECMO) support and are usually cared for in supine position. The physiologic and outcome benefits of routine PP of patients during VV ECMO remains unclear. Hence, we conducted the systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the outcome benefits of PP for patients with ARDS being treated with VV ECMO. METHODS: After registration with PROSPERO (CRD42020199723), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus and Cochrane databases were searched for relevant studies that reported PP in more than 10 adult patients supported with VV ECMO from origin to 1 March 2021. Studies were reviewed for quality using appropriate Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklists, and certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. The random-effects model (DerSimonian and Laird) was used. The primary outcome of interest was cumulative survival. Secondary outcomes were intensive care unit length of stay (ICU LOS) and ECMO duration. Changes in arterial blood gas (ABG) values, ventilator mechanics and complication rates were also studied. RESULTS: Of 812 potentially relevant publications, 12 studies (640 patients) met our inclusion criteria. Due to overlapping study populations, 11 studies were included in the final meta-analysis. Cumulative survival in patients that underwent PP was 57% (95% CI 41.9–71.4, high certainty). Patients that underwent PP had longer ICU LOS (+ 14.5 days, 95% CI 3.4–25.7, p = 0.01) and ECMO duration (+ 9.6 days, 95% CI 5.5–13.7, p < 0.0001). After PP, patients had significantly higher PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio, lower PaCO(2) and reduced ventilator driving pressure, and no major complications were reported. CONCLUSIONS: PP during VV ECMO appears safe with a cumulative survival of 57% and may result in longer ECMO runs and ICU LOS. However, evidence from appropriately designed randomized trials is needed prior to widespread adoption of PP on VV ECMO.

Functionally diverse immune cells arise from distinct waves of hematopoietic stem cells, a phenomenon referred to as ‘layered’ immunity. This stratified development of immune cells extends to lineages of both innate and adaptive cells. The defined time window for the development of these immune cells lends itself to the influence of specific exposures typical of the early life period. The perinatal immune system develops in a relatively sterile fetal environment but emerges into one filled with a multitude of antigenic encounters. A major burden of this comes in the form of the microbiota that is being newly established at mucosal surfaces of the newborn. Accumulating evidence suggests that early life microbial exposures, including those arising in utero, can imprint long-lasting changes in the offspring’s immune system and determine disease risk throughout life.

The presence of clusters of unvaccinated people has been associated with increased incidence of infectious disease outbreaks despite high vaccination coverage. The epidemiological consequences of homophily regarding other beliefs and correlations among belief systems are however poorly understood. Here, we use a simple compartmental disease model as well as a more complex COVID-19 model to study how homophily and correlation of belief systems in a social interaction network affect the probability of disease outbreak and COVID-19-related mortality. We find that the current social context, characterized by the presence of homophily and correlations between who vaccinates, who engages in risk reduction, and individual risk status, corresponds to a situation with substantially worse disease burden than in the absence of heterogeneities. In the presence of an effective vaccine, relative effects of homophily and correlation of belief systems become stronger. Further, the optimal vaccination strategy depends on the degree of homophily regarding vaccination status as well as the relative level of risk mitigation high- and low-risk individuals practice. The developed methods are broadly applicable to any investigation in which node attributes in a graph might reasonably be expected to cluster or exhibit correlations.","Kadelka, C.; McCombs, A.",,279,1

Here we briefly summarize information about age-related changes in the immune system and present current data on their impact on the formation of the immune response to vaccination. Older age is accompanied by the process of biological aging accompanied by involution of the immune system with increased susceptibility to infections and a decrease in the effect of immunization.

In this study, global mapping of H3K4me3 and transcriptomic analyses in the jejunum of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV)-infected and healthy piglets were performed by using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and RNA-seq techniques. A subset of genes and H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) histone modifications that are associated with PEDV infections were identified. The results revealed previously unknown and intriguing elements involved in the regulation of genes responsive to PEDV infections, which may aid in identifying key regulators and genetic resistant markers for PEDV infections. ABSTRACT: Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is currently detected as the main pathogen causing severe diarrhea in pig farms. The phenotypic alterations induced by pathogenic infections are usually tightly linked with marked changes in epigenetic modification and gene expression. We performed global mapping of H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and transcriptomic analyses in the jejunum of PEDV-infected and healthy piglets using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and RNA-seq techniques. A total of 1885 H3K4me3 peaks that are associated with 1723 genes were characterized. Moreover, 290 differentially expressed genes were identified, including 104 up-regulated and 186 down-regulated genes. Several antiviral genes including 2’-5’-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1), 2’-5’-oligoadenylate synthetase 2 (OAS2), ephrin B2 (EFNB2), and CDC28 protein kinase regulatory subunit 1B (CKS1B) with higher H3K4me3 enrichment and expression levels in PEDV-infected samples suggested the potential roles of H3K4me3 deposition in promoting their expressions. Transcription factor annotation analysis highlighted the potential roles of two transcription factors interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) and Kruppel like factor 4 (KLF4) in modulating the differential expression of genes involved in PEDV infection. The results provided novel insights into PEDV infection from the transcriptomic and epigenetic layers and revealed previously unknown and intriguing elements potentially involved in the host responses.","Wang, Haifei; Yang, Li; Qu, Huan; Feng, Haiyue; Wu, Shenglong; Bao, Wenbin",Animals (Basel),279,1

The CSFs were first identified from a review of literature before being verified by construction practitioners, using semi-structured interviews. A questionnaire, based on the verified CSFs, was distributed to construction practitioners in Iraq. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was used to analyze the quantitative data, and the results show that the CSFs can be categorized into four constructs: worker involvement, safety prevention and control system, safety arrangement, and management commitment. Following that, partial least square structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was executed to establish the connection between safety program implementation and overall project success. The result confirms that safety program implementation has a significant, positive impact on project success. This article contributes to knowledge and practice by identifying the CSFs for implementing safety programs in the Iraqi construction industry. The successful implementation of a safety program not only improves safety performance, but also helps to meet other project goals.","Buniya, Mohanad Kamil; Othman, Idris; Sunindijo, Riza Yosia; Kashwani, Ghanim; Durdyev, Serdar; Ismail, Syuhaida; Antwi-Afari, Maxwell Fordjour; Li, Heng",Int J Environ Res Public Health,279,20

Objectives: Assessing the spread of the COVID-19 across China, in relation to associations between cases and ecological factors including population density, temperature, solar radiation and precipitation. Methods: Open-access COVID-19 case data include 18,069 geo-located cases in China during January and February 2020, which were mapped onto a 0.25° latitude/longitude grid together with population and weather data (temperature, solar radiation and precipitation). Of 15,539 grid cells, 559 (3.6%) contained at least one case, and these were used to construct a Poisson regression model of cell-weeks. Weather parameters were taken for the preceding week given the established 5–7 day incubation period for COVID-19. The dependent variable in the Poisson model was incident cases per cell-week and exposure was cell population, allowing for clustering of cells over weeks, to give incidence rate ratios. Results: The overall COVID-19 incidence rate in cells with confirmed cases was 0.12 per 1,000. There was a single confirmed case in 113/559 (20.2%) of cells, while two grid cells recorded over 1,000 confirmed cases. Weekly means of maximum daily temperature varied from −28.0°C to 30.1°C, minimum daily temperature from −42.4°C to 23.0°C, maximum solar radiation from 0.04 to 2.74 MJm(−2) and total precipitation from 0 to 72.6 mm. Adjusted incidence rate ratios suggested brighter, warmer and drier conditions were associated with lower incidence. Conclusion: Though not demonstrating cause and effect, there were appreciable associations between weather and COVID-19 incidence during the epidemic in China. This does not mean the pandemic will go away with summer weather but demonstrates the importance of using weather conditions in understanding and forecasting the spread of COVID-19.","Byass, Peter",Glob Health Action,279,26

The severe and sudden onset of symptoms, resulting in an atypical pneumonia with dry cough and persistent high fever in cases of severe acute respiratory virus brought to light the importance of coronaviruses as potentially lethal human pathogens and the identification of several zoonotic reservoirs has made the reemergence of new strains and future epidemics all the more possible. In this chapter, we describe the pathology of SARS-CoV infection in humans and explore the use of two models of the human conducting airway to develop a better understanding of the replication and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV in relevant in vitro systems. The first culture model is a human bronchial epithelial cell line Calu3 that can be inoculated by viruses either as a non-polarized monolayer of cells or polarized cells with tight junctions and microvilli. The second model system, derived from primary cells isolated from human airway epithelium and grown on Transwells, form a pseudostratified mucociliary epithelium that recapitulates the morphological and physiological features of the human conducting airway in vivo. Experimental results using these lung epithelial cell models demonstrate that in contrast to the pathology reported in late stage cases SARS-CoV replicates to high titers in epithelial cells of the conducting airway. The SARS-CoV receptor, human angiotensin 1 converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), was detected exclusively on the apical surface of cells in polarized Calu3 cells and human airway epithelial cultures (HAE), indicating that hACE2 was accessible by SARS-CoV after airway lumenal delivery. Furthermore, in HAE, hACE2 was exclusively localized to ciliated airway epithelial cells. In support of the hACE2 localization data, the most productive route of inoculation and progeny virion egress in both polarized Calu3 and ciliated cells of HAE was the apical surface suggesting mechanisms to release large quantities of virus into the lumen of the human lung. Preincubation of the apical surface of cultures with antisera directed against hACE2 reduced viral titers by 2 logs while antisera against DC-SIGN/DC-SIGNR did not reduce viral replication levels suggesting that hACE2 is the primary receptor for entry of SARS-CoV into the ciliated cells of HAE cultures. To assess infectivity in ciliated airway cultures derived from susceptible animal species we generated a recombinant SARS-CoV by deletion of open reading frame 7a/7b (ORF 7a/b) and insertion of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) resulting in SARS-CoV GFP. SARS-CoV GFP replicated to similar titers as wild type viruses in Vero E6, MA104, and CaCo2 cells. In addition, SARS-CoV replication in airway epithelial cultures generated from Golden Syrian hamster tracheas reached similar titers to the human cultures by 72 hours post infection. Efficient SARS-CoV infection of ciliated cell-types in HAE provides a useful in vitro model of human lung origin to study characteristics of SARS-CoV replication and pathogenesis.","Sims, Amy C.; Burkett, Susan E.; Yount, Boyd; Pickles, Raymond J.",Virus Research,279,30

However, a minority suffers from severe disease with substantial morbidity and mortality. We report results from a non-interventional validation study comprising 248 patients (132 males, 116 females) with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections from three tertiary care referral centers in Germany and France. Overall median age was 60 years. The ICU group comprised more males, whereas the outpatient group contained a higher percentage of females. For each patient, the serum or plasma sample obtained closest after symptom onset was examined. Patients with critical disease had significantly lower levels of anti-HCoV OC43 nucleocapsid protein (NP)-specific antibodies compared to other COVID-19 patients (p=0.025). OC43 negative inpatients had an increased risk of critical disease (adjusted odds ratio 2.81 [95% CI 1.10 - 7.87]), higher than the risk by increased age or BMI, and lower than the risk by male sex. Frequency of critical disease in COVID-19 inpatients was significantly different according to OC43 status (p=0.009): 23 of 32 (72%) OC43 negative, 46 of 92 (50%) OC43 below or with cutoff, 5 of 18 (28%) OC43 positive inpatients required ICU therapy, respectively. Our results indicate that prior infections with seasonal human coronaviruses can protect against a severe course of COVID-19. Therefore, anti-OC43 antibodies should be measured for COVID-19 inpatients and considered as part of the risk assessment for each patient. Hence, we expect individuals tested negative for anti-OC43 antibodies to particularly benefit from vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, especially with other risk factors prevailing.","Dugas, M.; Grote-Westrick, T.; Merle, U.; Fontenay, M.; Kremer, A.

A variety of animal models of cardiac disease have been developed to better understand the etiology, cellular and molecular mechanisms of cardiac dysfunction and novel therapeutic strategies. The animal models have included large animals (e.g. pig and dog) and small rodents (e.g. mouse and rat) and the advantages of genetic manipulation in mice have appropriately encouraged the development of novel mouse models of cardiac disease. However, there are major differences between rodent and human hearts that raise cautions about the extrapolation of results from mouse to human. The rabbit is a medium-sized animal that has many cellular and molecular characteristics very much like human, and is a practical alternative to larger mammals. Numerous rabbit models of cardiac disease are discussed, including pressure or volume overload, ischemia, rapid-pacing, doxorubicin, drug-induced arrhythmias, transgenesis and infection. These models also lead to the assessment of therapeutic strategies which may become beneficial in human cardiac disease.","Pogwizd, Steven M.; Bers, Donald M.",Drug Discov Today Dis Models,279,16

This study aimed to identify the risk factors associated with mortality and outcomes in hospitalized Mexican patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We prospectively assessed patients admitted to a COVID-19 reference center in southeast Mexico between March 28 and June 30, 2020. Mortality was defined as survivors or non-survivors and univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to explore the association of the clinical characteristics and laboratory parameters with mortality. RESULTS: We included 200 patients with a mean age of 55 years, 69% were men and 72% had at least one chronic comorbidity. Eighty-six patients required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) with an overall mortality rate of 82.5%. Only 51% of the patients with IMV were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), with a survival rate of 27.3%, but only 7.2% for patients without ICU admissions (p=0.014). The multivariate analysis found that a neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio ≥9 (odds ratio [OR], 4.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.05–10.53) albumin <3.5 g/dL (OR, 3.76; 95% CI, 1.56–9.07), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level ≥725 U/L (OR, 5.45; 95% CI, 2.36–12.57), and IMV (OR, 64.7; 95% CI, 15.20–275.39) were independent risk factors associated with mortality. CONCLUSION: Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, LDH, albumin, and IMV were independent risk factors for mortality in Mexican patients with COVID-19. Also, the availability of ICU resources is invaluable for better outcomes in critically ill patients. Our results could provide clinical information for timely decision-making in low-and-middle income countries to overcome the pandemic.","Cortés-Tellés, Arturo; López-Romero, Stephanie; Mancilla-Ceballos, Roberto; Ortíz-Farías, Diana Lizbeth; Núñez-Caamal, Nelda; Figueroa-Hurtado, Esperanza",Tuberc Respir Dis (Seoul),279,28

This study’s primary objective was to analyze the hospital’s potential hazards of COVID-19 prevention and control. The second objective was to review the disaster plan and make recommendations to minimize the spread of COVID-19 in hospitals. METHODS: An expert group for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in the First People’s Hospital of Long-quanyi Dis-trict, Chengdu, China was established. We adopted the hazard vulnerability analysis (HVA) to risk-stratify potential hazards and calculated relative risk values. We used the Delphi expert consultation method to propose and implement targeted improvement measures for the top five potential hazards. Then, the effects before and after the intervention were compared. RESULTS: The top five hazards were: insufficient Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) (25.68%), inadequate diagnosis ability of clinicians (22.55%), and inadequate management strategies of patients and caregivers (22.38%), lack of professional ability of pre-checking and triage staff (16.96%), lack of knowledge of COVID-19 of medical staff (15.59%). After taking targeted improvement measures, the average score of the hospital staff’s COVID-19 knowledge test increased from 73.26 points to 90.44 points, the average test score of the outsourcing company employees increased from 68.55 to 89.75 points. The differences were statistically significant (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: HVA can be used to systematically risk-stratify potential threats, measure the probability of those potential hazards, and develop various hospital prevention and control measures for COVID-19 epidemics.","MA, Li; ZOU, Shiyue; LIU, Yanyi; LAI, Jing; YANG, Junhua",Iran J Public Health,279,17

We conclude that the directional trend in cases has been from East to West with the area affected increasing with time. Hot spot analysis reveals that recurring counties with a high number of human cases have been in the metro areas of large cities. However, normalized results indicate that the rate of humans showing symptoms of WNV is greatest in rural areas, particularly the Great Plains.

The permeability of parts of a FFP2 mask was measured before and after six cleanings with ethanol. As for any porous medium, the filtering properties of a mask are related to the size and tortuosity of the pores of the filter, and are quantified by its permeability. Any damage to the filter will change its permeability. We show here that after six cleaning cycles, the permeability remains very close to the permeability before cleaning. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic and the shortage of protective masks, this study suggests that ethanol could be used to sanitize a FFP2 mask without significantly altering its filtering properties.

In order to understand the molecular epidemiology and genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in China, we generated 53 genomes from infected individuals in Guangdong using a combination of metagenomic sequencing and tiling amplicon approaches. Combined epidemiological and phylogenetic analyses indicate multiple independent introductions to Guangdong, although phylogenetic clustering is uncertain because of low virus genetic variation early in the pandemic. Our results illustrate how the timing, size, and duration of putative local transmission chains were constrained by national travel restrictions and by the province’s large-scale intensive surveillance and intervention measures.

There are no evidence-based, validated tools to assist physicians in management and disposition decisions for children presenting to the ED with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The objective of this study is to develop a clinical prediction model to accurately stratify children with CAP who are at risk for low, moderate and severe disease across a global network of EDs. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study is a prospective cohort study enrolling up to 4700 children with CAP at EDs at ~80 member sites of the Pediatric Emergency Research Networks (PERN; https://pern-global.com/). We will include children aged 3 months to <14 years with a clinical diagnosis of CAP. We will exclude children with hospital admissions within 7 days prior to the study visit, hospital-acquired pneumonias or chronic complex conditions. Clinical, laboratory and imaging data from the ED visit and hospitalisations within 7 days will be collected. A follow-up telephone or text survey will be completed 7–14 days after the visit. The primary outcome is a three-tier composite of disease severity. Ordinal logistic regression, assuming a partial proportional odds specification, and recursive partitioning will be used to develop the risk stratification models. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study will result in a clinical prediction model to accurately identify risk of severe disease on presentation to the ED. Ethics approval was obtained for all sites included in the study. Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Institutional Review Board (IRB) serves as the central IRB for most US sites. Informed consent will be obtained from all participants. Results will be disseminated through international conferences and peer-reviewed publications.

Herein, we assess mechanisms of RNA condensation and how cells modulate this phenomenon. We propose that cells control RNA condensation through ATP-dependent processes, static RNA buffering, and dynamic post-translational mechanisms. Moreover, perturbations in these mechanisms can be involved in disease.

In an unknown percentage of patients, this leads to a condition called hypertrophic olivary degeneration (HOD). Characteristic clinical symptoms of HOD progress slowly over months and consist of a rhythmic palatal tremor, vertical pendular nystagmus, and Holmes tremor of the upper limbs. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) with tractography is a promising method to identify functional pathway lesions along the cerebello-thalamo-cortical connectivity and to generate a deeper understanding of the HOD pathophysiology. The incidence of HOD development following stroke and the timeline of clinical symptoms have not yet been determined in prospective studies—a prerequisite for the surveillance of patients at risk. Methods and Analysis: Patients with ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes in the brainstem and cerebellum with a topo-anatomical relation to the GMT are recruited within certified stroke units of the Interdisciplinary Neurovascular Network of the Rhine-Main. Matching lesions are identified using a predefined MRI template. Eligible patients are prospectively followed up and present at 4 and 8 months after the index event. During study visits, a clinical neurological examination and brain MRI, including high-resolution T2-, proton-density-weighted imaging, and DTI tractography, are performed. Fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing is optional if palatal tremor is encountered. Study Outcomes: The primary endpoint of this prospective clinical multicenter study is to determine the frequency of radiological HOD development in patients with a posterior fossa stroke affecting the GMT at 8 months after the index event.

The impact of this change on drug use is unknown. This study explores the impact of the federal take-out variance on drug use in one urban opioid treatment program as measured by drug testing. METHODS: This study collected drug test results from 613 patients receiving methadone from July 2020, following COVID-19-related take-out dose adjustments, and July 2019 for comparison. Using a generalized linear mixed model, we computed the average estimated probability of a positive drug test for each year for each take-out phase. To isolate the effect of changing take-out, we removed the main effect of year, while retaining the main effect of take-out phase and the interaction between year and phase. RESULTS: The percent of drug tests positive for opiates, benzodiazepines, and methamphetamine was greater in July 2020 than in July 2019 (p < 0.001 for each), while the percent of tests negative for methadone increased (p < 0.001). Oxycodone, barbiturate, and cocaine positive tests remained stable. In a separate analysis of opioid and non-opioid test results, take-out phase was associated with both opioid and non-opioid positive results (p < 0.001, each outcome). The association of take-out phase with opioid and non-opioid positive results differed in the two years (year-by-phase interaction p < 0.025, each outcome). After removing the year main effect, the rate of positive tests was lower in 2020 for the smallest number of take-out doses, higher for a moderate number of take-out doses, and about the same for the highest number of take-out doses. CONCLUSIONS: Positive opioid and non-opioid drug tests increased following the federal variance allowing more methadone take-out doses, but these findings cannot fully be attributed to alterations in the take-out schedule.","Bart, Gavin; Wastvedt, Solvejg; Hodges, James S.; Rosenthal, Rebecca",J Subst Abuse Treat,279,24

Panic buying is identified as one such side effect. Among various models and measures undertaken by government to manage the pandemic, timed-intervention policy is commonly practiced by most countries. This paper examines the timing effect between government measures and panic buying. Three studies were undertaken to understand the timing effect and identify a connection between timed measures and consumer behaviours. Semantic analysis, secondary data search, and big data analytics were deployed to address the research aim. Although claiming a causal relationship is cautioned, the findings reveal a connection between timing of government measures and panic buying. These findings are discussed with the support of real-life evidence. Implications for researchers and practitioners conclude this paper.","Prentice, Catherine; Chen, Jinyan; Stantic, Bela",Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services,279,28

The prevalence of antibodies against Cp felis was 11%, with no significant difference between purebred and mixed breed cats. The overall prevalence of antibodies against FCoV was 31%, significantly higher among pure breed cats (65%) than among mixed breed cats (17%). A high proportion of cats with antibodies against FCoV had relatively high antibody titres, and was therefore likely to be shedding FCoV in faeces. For Cp felis, the majority of seropositive animals had relatively low antibody titres, and the risk of these animals infecting others is not known.","Holst, Bodil Ström; Englund, Lena; Palacios, S.; Renström, Lena; Berndtsson, Louise T.",J Feline Med Surg,279,22

In this study, we examined the usefulness of this assay to detect other lineage C betacoronaviruses closely related to MERS-CoV in bats. The rapid MERS-CoV nucleocapsid protein detection assay was tested positive in 24 (88.9%) of 27 Tylonycteris bat CoV HKU4 (Ty-BatCoV-HKU4) RNA-positive alimentary samples of Tylonycteris pachypus and 4 (19.0%) of 21 Pipistrellus bat CoV HKU5 (Pi-BatCoV-HKU5) RNA-positive alimentary samples of Pipistrellus abramus. There was significantly more Ty-BatCoV-HKU4 RNA-positive alimentary samples than Pi-BatCoV-HKU5 RNA-positive alimentary samples that were tested positive by the rapid MERS-CoV nucleocapsid protein detection assay (P < 0.001 by Chi-square test). The rapid assay was tested negative in all 51 alimentary samples RNA-positive for alphacoronaviruses (Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU2, Myotis bat CoV HKU6, Miniopterus bat CoV HKU8 and Hipposideros batCoV HKU10) and 32 alimentary samples positive for lineage B (SARS-related Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU3) and lineage D (Rousettus bat CoV HKU9) betacoronaviruses. No significant difference was observed between the viral loads of Ty-BatCoV-HKU4/Pi-BatCoV-HKU5 RNA-positive alimentary samples that were tested positive and negative by the rapid test (Mann-Witney U test). The rapid MERS-CoV nucleocapsid protein detection assay is able to rapidly detect lineage C betacoronaviruses in bats. It detected significantly more Ty-BatCoV-HKU4 than Pi-BatCoV-HKU5 because MERS-CoV is more closely related to Ty-BatCoV-HKU4 than Pi-BatCoV-HKU5. This assay will facilitate rapid on-site mass screening of animal samples for ancestors of MERS-CoV and tracking transmission in the related bat species.","Woo, Patrick C. Y.; Lau, Susanna K.

After their secretion by muscles, these factors serve many biological functions, including the exertion of complex autocrine, paracrine and/or endocrine effects. In sum, myokines affect complex multi-organ processes, such as skeletal muscle trophism, metabolism, angiogenesis and immunological response to different physiological (physical activity, aging, etc.) or pathological states (cachexia, dysmetabolic conditions, chronic inflammation, etc.). The aim of this review is to describe in detail a number of myokines that are, to varying degrees, involved in skeletal muscle aging processes and belong to the group of proteins present in the functional environment surrounding the muscle cell known as the “Niche”. The particular myokines described are those that, acting both from within the cell and in an autocrine manner, have a defined relationship with the modulation of oxidative stress in muscle cells (mature or stem) involved in the regulatory (metabolic or regenerative) processes of muscle aging. Myostatin, IGF-1, NGF, S100 and irisin are examples of specific myokines that have peculiar features in their mechanisms of action. In particular, the potential role of one of the most recently characterized myokines—irisin, directly linked to an active lifestyle—in reducing if not reversing senescence-induced oxidative damage is discussed in terms of its possible application as an agent able to counteract the deleterious effects of muscle aging.","Mancinelli, Rosa; Checcaglini, Franco; Coscia, Francesco; Gigliotti, Paola; Fulle, Stefania; Fanò-Illic, Giorgio",Int J Mol Sci,279,1

Design: Multicenter observational retrospective cohort study. Setting: Greater Paris University hospitals, France. Participants: 7,345 adults hospitalized for COVID-19 between 24 January and 1 April 2020, including 138 patients (1.9%) who received hydroxyzine during the visit at a mean dose of 49.8 mg (SD=51.5) for an average of 22.4 days (SD=25.9). Data source: Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris Health Data Warehouse. Main outcome measures: The study endpoint was death. We compared this endpoint between patients who received hydroxyzine and those who did not in time-to-event analyses adjusting for patient characteristics (such as age, sex, and comorbidities), clinical and biological markers of disease severity, and use of other medications. The primary analysis was a multivariable Cox model with inverse probability weighting. Sensitivity analyses included a multivariable Cox model and a univariate Cox regression model in a 1:1 ratio matched analytic sample. Results: Over a mean follow-up of 20.3 days (SD=27.5), 994 patients (13.5%) had a primary end-point event. The primary multivariable analysis with inverse probability weighting showed a significant association between hydroxyzine use and reduced mortality (HR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.25 to 0.71; p=0.001) with a significant dose-effect relationship (HR, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.45; p=0.003). This association was similar in sensitivity analyses. In secondary analyses conducted among subsamples of patients, we found a significant association between hydroxyzine use and a faster decrease in biological inflammatory markers associated with COVID-19-related mortality, including neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio (LCRP), and circulating interleukin 6 levels (IL-6) (all p<0.016), with a significant dose-effect relationship for NLR and LCRP (both p<0.037). Conclusions: In this retrospective observational study, hydroxyzine use was associated with reduced mortality in patients hospitalized for COVID-19. This association may be partially mediated by specific anti-inflammatory properties of H1 antihistamines. Double-blind controlled randomized clinical trials of hydroxyzine for COVID-19 are needed to confirm these results.","Hoertel, N.; Sanchez, M.; Vernet, R.; Beeker, N.; Neuraz, A.; Blanco, C.; Olfson, M.; Wall, M.

This kind of unity has many advantages, including unique ideas that are very helpful in a competitive environment, improve performance and knowledge, and create stronger supportive work relationships. Patient’s health can be improved by using comprehensive treatment. This provides an urgent need for multidisciplinary partnership in the medical community. Optimal pharmacological treatment is crucial to achieving treatment goals. To ensure excellent quality of medical care, interprofessional cooperation between physicians and pharmacists and/or other medical professionals is necessary. Their complementary knowledge and experience can lead to improved health outcomes and can also reduce treatment costs. There are also many barriers and difficulties in legal systems that would allow for more effective inter-professional cooperation.

Taking the urgent need to find new therapeutics for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19), a dataset of plant‐based natural compounds was selected for the screening of antiviral activity. The viral 3‐chymotrypsin‐like cysteine protease (Mpro, 3CLpro) was selected as the target. Molecular docking was performed on 2,845 phytochemicals to estimate the spatial affinity for the active sites of the enzyme. The ADMET screening was used for the pharmacological and physicochemical properties of the hit compounds. Nelfinavir and Lopinavir were used as control for binding energy comparison. The top 10 hits, based on the binding energy (Kcal/mol), were Ginkgolide M (−11.2), Mezerein (−11), Tubocurarine (−10.9), Gnidicin (−10.4), Glycobismine A (−10.4), Sciadopitysin Z‐10.2), Gnididin (−9.2), Glycobismine A (−10.4), Sciadopitysin (−10.2), Gnididin (−9.20, Emetine (−8.7), Vitexin (−8.3), Calophyllolide (−8.3), and 6‐(3,3‐Dimethylallyl)galangin (−7.9). The binding energy for nelfinavir and lopinavir were − 9.1 and − 8.4, respectively. Interestingly, some of these natural products were previously shown to possess antiviral properties against various viruses, such as HIV, Zika, and Ebola viruses.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Some 961 participants were monitored in a study in Madrid at 2 time points: before lockdown (T0) and after completion of the total lockdown (T1). A questionnaire that included basic sociodemographic variables, the perceived vulnerability to disease scale (including perceived infectability and germ aversion), the fear of COVID-19 scale, and dental visiting behaviour after confinement for fear of COVID was administered. RESULTS: The participants had higher scores for infectability and germ aversion at T1 than at T0 (P < 0.01). Of those studied, 24.5% (235) of the participants would not go to the dentist for fear of COVID-19. Those who had a high perceived infectability scale score were at least 5 times more likely to not visit the dentist. Those with high COVID-19 fear were at least 6 times more likely to not visit the dentist, and those older than 60 years were 8 times more likely to not visit. CONCLUSIONS: The population's high levels of vulnerability to infectability and perceived germ aversion associated with fear of COVID-19 and the resultant avoidance behaviour to dental care will remain until an effective drug or vaccine for SARS-CoV2 is found.","González-Olmo, María José; Delgado-Ramos, Bendición; Ortega-Martínez, Ana Raquel; Romero-Maroto, Martín; Carrillo-Díaz, María",Int Dent J,279,16

We also review the characteristics of species that should be the greatest threat for future invasions, including those that pave the way for invasions by other species (“invasional meltdown”). Susceptible aquatic communities, such as reservoirs, may serve as stepping stones for invasions of new landscapes. Some microbes disperse long distance, infect new hosts and grow in the external aquatic medium, a process that has consequences for human health. We also discuss the interaction between species invasions and other human impacts (climate change, landscape conversion), as well as the possible connection of invasions with regime shifts in lakes. Since many invaders become permanent features of the environment, we discuss how humans live with invasive species, and conclude with questions for future research.","Havel, John E.; Kovalenko, Katya E.; Thomaz, Sidinei Magela; Amalfitano, Stefano; Kats, Lee B.",Hydrobiologia,279,20

IFN-α is first produced upon viral detection by pathogen recognition receptors. Following its expression, IFN-α embarks upon a complex downstream signalling cascade called the JAK/STAT pathway. This signalling pathway results in the expression of hundreds of effector genes known as interferon stimulated genes (ISGs). These genes are the basis for an elaborate effector mechanism and ultimately, the clearance of viral infection. ISGs mark an elegant mechanism of anti-viral host defence that warrants renewed research focus in our global efforts to treat existing and emerging viruses. By understanding the mechanistic role of individual ISGs we anticipate the discovery of a new “treasure trove” of anti-viral mediators that may pave the way for more effective, targeted and less toxic anti-viral therapies. Therefore, with the aim of highlighting the value of the innate type 1 IFN response in our battle against viral infection, this review outlines both historic and recent advances in understanding the IFN-α JAK/STAT pathway, with a focus on new research discoveries relating to specific ISGs and their potential role in curing existing and future emergent viral infections.","Raftery, Nicola; Stevenson, Nigel J.",Cell Mol Life Sci,279,26

BACKGROUND: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, health organisations limited access for visitors. INTRODUCTION: Family centred care needs to be guaranteed, and alternatives for face-to-face interaction should be fostered. Therefore, there is an urgent need to rethink the family in nursing care during a pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a descriptive exploratory mixed-method study in Portugal using an electronic questionnaire. The study included 192 nurses recruited using a non-probabilistic convenience sample. The study was reported using the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. RESULTS: A total of 41.1% of participants (n = 79) reported that visits to their services were not authorised, and 66.7% (n = 128) reported resorting to video calls because of the restrictions imposed. Regarding attitude assessment, the average score of the scale was 77.9 (SD = 10.0), ranging between 26 and 98. When analysing the different dimensions of the 'Families' Importance in Nursing Care - Nurses Attitudes' scale, family data stand out as a burden. CONCLUSION: Although a large percentage of participants had a positive attitude towards families and tried to find strategies to maintain family centred care, many nurses still considered the family as a burden. The current COVID-19 pandemic may have aggravated this perception. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE, NURSING POLICY AND HEALTH POLICY: The continued implementation of family centred nursing practice is essential for child-well-being, including during the current pandemic. Therefore, having intervention policies with alternative forms of care is highly recommended.","Fernandes, Carla Sílvia; Magalhães, Bruno; Silva, Sílvia; Edra, Beatriz",Int. nurs. rev,279,20

It has an excellent prognosis, with a five-year relative survival rate of 98.3%.Differentiated Thyroid Carcinomas (DTCs) are the most diagnosed thyroid tumors and are characterized by a slow growth rate and indolent course. For years, the only approach to treatment was thyroidectomy. Active surveillance (AS) has recently emerged as an alternative approach; it involves regular observation aimed at recognizing the minority of patients who will clinically progress and would likely benefit from rescue surgery. To better clarify the indications for active surveillance for low-risk thyroid cancers, we reviewed the current management of low-risk DTCs with a systematic search performed according to a PRISMA flowchart in electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and EMBASE) for studies published before May 2021. Fourteen publications were included for final analysis, with a total number of 4830 patients under AS. A total of 451/4830 (9.4%) patients experienced an increase in maximum diameter by >3 mm; 609/4830 (12.6%) patients underwent delayed surgery after AS; metastatic spread to cervical lymph nodes was present in 88/4213 (2.1%) patients; 4/3589 (0.1%) patients had metastatic disease outside of cervical lymph nodes. Finally, no subject had a documented mortality due to thyroid cancer during AS. Currently, the American Thyroid Association guidelines do not support AS as the first-line treatment in patients with PMC; however, they consider AS to be an effective alternative, particularly in patients with high surgical risk or poor life expectancy due to comorbid conditions. Thus, AS could be an alternative to immediate surgery for patients with very-low-risk tumors showing no cytologic evidence of aggressive disease, for high-risk surgical candidates, for those with concurrent comorbidities requiring urgent intervention, and for patients with a relatively short life expectancy.","Patrone, Renato; Velotti, Nunzio; Masone, Stefania; Conzo, Alessandra; Flagiello, Luigi; Cacciatore, Chiara; Filardo, Marco; Granata, Vincenza; Izzo, Francesco; Testa, Domenico; Avenia, Stefano; Sanguinetti, Alessandro; Polistena, Andrea; Conzo, Giovanni",J Clin Med,279,1

We present a case wherein an ESRD patient had been receiving excess zinc for several months and subsequently experienced EPO-resistant anemia. Our patient's GI work-up was negative, and increased doses of iron and EPO-stimulating agent were ineffective. She underwent a bone marrow biopsy and more serological testing.

Despite offering various benefits, online environments are also replete with smart, highly adaptive choice architectures designed primarily to maximize commercial interests, capture and sustain users’ attention, monetize user data, and predict and influence future behavior. This online landscape holds multiple negative consequences for society, such as a decline in human autonomy, rising incivility in online conversation, the facilitation of political extremism, and the spread of disinformation. Benevolent choice architects working with regulators may curb the worst excesses of manipulative choice architectures, yet the strategic advantages, resources, and data remain with commercial players. One way to address some of this imbalance is with interventions that empower Internet users to gain some control over their digital environments, in part by boosting their information literacy and their cognitive resistance to manipulation. Our goal is to present a conceptual map of interventions that are based on insights from psychological science. We begin by systematically outlining how online and offline environments differ despite being increasingly inextricable. We then identify four major types of challenges that users encounter in online environments: persuasive and manipulative choice architectures, AI-assisted information architectures, false and misleading information, and distracting environments. Next, we turn to how psychological science can inform interventions to counteract these challenges of the digital world. After distinguishing among three types of behavioral and cognitive interventions—nudges, technocognition, and boosts—we focus on boosts, of which we identify two main groups: (a) those aimed at enhancing people’s agency in their digital environments (e.g., self-nudging, deliberate ignorance) and (b) those aimed at boosting competencies of reasoning and resilience to manipulation (e.g., simple decision aids, inoculation). These cognitive tools are designed to foster the civility of online discourse and protect reason and human autonomy against manipulative choice architectures, attention-grabbing techniques, and the spread of false information.","Kozyreva, Anastasia; Lewandowsky, Stephan; Hertwig, Ralph",Psychol Sci Public Interest,279,21

In Burkina Faso, the proportion of fevers that could be due to dengue is growing. In 2013, a dengue epidemic spread there, followed by other seasonal outbreaks. Dengue is often confused with malaria, and health workers are not trained to distinguish between them. Three training videos using different narrative genres were tested with nursing students from two institutions in Ouagadougou: journalistic, dramatic and animated video. The study aimed to determine if video is an effective knowledge transfer tool, if narrative genre plays a role in knowledge acquisition, and which narrative elements are the most appreciated. METHODOLOGY: A mixed method research design was used. The relative effectiveness of the videos was verified through a quasi-experimental quantitative component with a comparison group and post-test measurements. A qualitative component identified participants’ perceptions regarding the three videos. Data were drawn from a knowledge test (n = 482), three focus groups with health professionals’ students (n = 46), and individual interviews with health professionals (n = 10). Descriptive statistics and single-factor variance analysis were produced. A thematic analysis was used to analyse qualitative data. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Results showed that all three videos led to significant rates of knowledge improvement when compared with the comparison group (p <0.05): 12.31% for the journalistic video, 20.58% for the dramatic video, and 18.91% for the animated video. The dramatic and animated videos produced a significantly higher increase in knowledge than did the journalistic video (with respectively 8.27% (p = 0.003) and 6.59% (p = 0.029) and can be considered equivalent with a difference of 1.68% (p = 0.895). Thematic analysis also revealed that these two videos were considered to be better knowledge transfer tools. Four key aspects are important to consider for a video to be effective: 1) transmitting information in a narrative form, 2) choosing good communicators, 3) creating a visual instrument that reinforces the message and 4) adapting the message to the local context. CONCLUSIONS: Video has proven to be an effective and appreciated knowledge transfer and training tool for health professionals, but the narrative genre of the videos can influence knowledge acquisition. The production of other videos should be considered for training or updating health professionals and their narrative genre taken into consideration. The actual context of constant circulation of new diseases, such as COVID-19, reaffirms the need to train health professionals.","Hébert, Catherine; Dagenais, Christian; Mc Sween-Cadieux, Esther; Ridde, Valéry",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,279,1

METHODS Questionnaires emailed to 28 European Economic Area (EEA) Medical Product Licensing Authorities (MPLAs) and Swissmedic MPLA were analysed in 2019/2020 which asked whether DTP of IMPs was legal, followed by comparative legal analysis profiling relevant national civil and criminal liability provisions in 30 European jurisdictions (including The Netherlands), finally summarising accessible COVID-19 related guidance in searches of 30 official MPLA websites in January 2021. RESULTS Twenty MPLAs responded. Twelve consented to response publication in 2021. DTP was not widely authorised, though different phrases were used to explain this. Our legal review of national laws in 29 EEA jurisdictions and Switzerland did not identify any specific sanctions for DTP of IMPs, however, we identified potential national civil and criminal liability provisions. Switzerland provides legal clarity where DTP of IMPs is conditionally legal. MPLA webpage searches for COVID-19 guidance, noted conditional acceptance by 19 MPLAs. CONCLUSIONS Specific national legislation authorising DTP of IMPs, defining IMP categories, and conditions permitting the postage and delivery by courier in an EEA-wide clinical trial, would support innovative patient-centered research for multi-country remote clinical trials. Despite it appearing more acceptable to do this between EU Member States, provided each EU MPLA and ethics board authorises it, temporary Covid-19 restrictions in national GCP guidance, discourages innovative research into the safety and effectiveness of clinical trial medications.","Malone, Maeve; Ferguson, Pamela; Rogers, Amy; Mackenzie, Isla S; Rorie, David A; MacDonald, Thomas M",British journal of clinical pharmacology,279,20

Thrombosis is a known component of sepsis and disseminated intravascular coagulation. We sought to compare the level of platelet deposition in the pulmonary vasculature in cases of confirmed COVID-19 infection to other lung injuries and infections. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was performed on 27 autopsy cases and 2 surgical pathology cases targeting CD61. Multiple cases of normal lung, diffuse alveolar damage, COVID-19, influenza, and bacterial and fungal infections, as well as one case of pulmonary emboli, were included. The levels of CD61 staining were compared quantitatively in the autopsy cases, and patterns of staining were described. RESULTS: Nearly all specimens exhibited an increase in CD61 staining relative to control lung tissue. The area of CD61 staining in COVID-19 infection was higher than influenza but still comparable to many other infectious diseases. Cases of aspiration pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus infection, and blastomycosis exhibited the highest levels of CD61 staining. CONCLUSIONS: Platelet deposition is a phenomenon common to many pulmonary insults. A spectrum of staining patterns was observed, suggestive of pathogen-specific mechanisms of platelet deposition. Further study into the mechanisms driving platelet deposition in pulmonary injuries and infections is warranted.","McMullen, Phillip D; Cho, Joseph H; Miller, Jonathan L; Husain, Aliya N; Pytel, Peter; Krausz, Thomas",Am J Clin Pathol,279,26

Remarkably, increased SARS-CoV-2 viral load and more severe lung damage were observed in mice co-infected with IAV in vivo. Moreover, such enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity was not seen with several other viruses probably due to a unique IAV segment as an inducer to elevate ACE2 expression.

Health care workers (HCWs) are at risk of acquiring the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection (SARS-CoV-2). The aim of the study is to determine the SARS-CoV-2 positivity rates during the first epidemiologic peak among HCWs of a south Belgian hospital and to identify risks factors for infection. Methods. All hospital staff who worked during the first epidemiological peak were asked to answer a questionnaire regarding demographical data, function, type of working unit, type of contact with patients, eventual symptomatology, and the positivity of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing or immunoassay. Results. A total of 235 questionnaires were collected; 90 (38%) HCWs tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 from either RT-PCR or immunoassay testing. The positivity rate of HCWs between wards was statistically different (p = 0.004) and was higher in COVID-19 wards than Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and Emergency Department (ED). A total of 114 (49%) HCWs presented SARS-CoV-2-compatible symptomatology; 79 (88%) were positive on either RT-PCR or immunoassay testing; 74 (37%) HCWs were unable to work during the studied period; 5 were hospitalized. No deaths were reported. Multivariate logistic regression modeling showed that having symptoms was highly associated with test positivity (OR 23.3, CI 11.1, 53.1, p-value < 0.001). Working in a COVID-19 ward against working in ICU or ED was also predictive of positivity among HCWs (OR 3.25, CI 1.50, 7.28, p-value = 0.003). Discussion and Conclusions. This study shows a higher positivity rate compared to already reported positivity rates among HCWs. Reported differences in positivity rates depend on many factors, such as local crisis intensity, screening strategy, training in use of self-protective equipment, and study selection bias. HCWs working in COVID-19 wards, in comparison to ED and ICU, seemed at greater risk of being infected in this study. This could be explained by the disparity of HCWs’ experience in handling self-protective equipment and knowledge in infection prevention. Hence, care should be taken in proper training for less-experienced HCWs during hospital epidemics. The latter could increase HCWs’ protection and consequently decrease work absenteeism, ensuring enhanced continuity of patient care during hospital crisis. Rapid quarantine of symptomatic HCWs could reduce contamination rates, as having symptoms was highly associated with test positivity in this study.","Kapuczinski, Abeline; de Terwangne, Christophe; De Keukeleire, Steven; Goffard, Jean-Christophe; Sorgente, Antonio; Place, Sammy; De Cubber, Michael",Pathogens,279,16

Lymphoma patients need to be distinguished from the general population because of their deficient immune status and intensive anti-tumor treatment. The impacts of cancer subtypes and treatment on COVID-19 infection are unclear. Case Presentation: We here report the case of a primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma patient who was infected with COVID-19 after intensive immunochemotherapy (DA-EPOCH-R). The patient developed a neutropenic fever during chemotherapy, and fever was persistent, although antibiotics were used. Initial chest CT was negative, and the patient received a throat swab test since the second CT showed evidence of pneumonia. With treatment with Arbidol Hydrochloride and LianHuaQingWen capsule, his COVID-19 was cured. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report focusing on COVID-19 infection in a lymphoma patient undergoing intensive immunochemotherapy. For those patients being treated with immunochemotherapy in epidemic areas, a reduced dose intensity of intensive chemotherapy should be considered, and the effect of immunotherapies such as rituximab on COVID-19 infection should be considered.

Delays in diagnosis and challenges in management can lead to serious adverse outcomes for the mother and child. As rates of GDM diagnosis increase worldwide, health systems and maternity services have become increasingly strained, especially with new restrictions around in-person care due to the current COVID-19 pandemic. Mobile health (mHealth) has increasingly shown promise for management of chronic disease, driven by smartphone adoption and increased internet connectivity. The aim of this work was to evaluate the adoption and multidisciplinary care coordination of an mHealth platform called M♡THer in a cohort of women with first-time diagnosis of GDM. Methods: The mHealth platform for GDM management was developed incorporating a smartphone application, clinician portal, and secure cloud data storage. Forty participants with a first-time diagnosis of GDM were recruited to use the app during their pregnancy. User attitudes from clinicians and women were captured through post-hoc surveys, and app-usage metrics. Results: Clinicians and women indicated satisfaction and ease of use of the mHealth platform, with some technological challenges around wireless connectivity. Blood glucose reviews and antenatal contact were higher with use of the M♡THer app compared with a matched historical sample.

The present study aims to characterize the nature of exposure and to describe the local population dynamics underlying its apparent resistance to COVID-19, hypothesizing the presence of several co-factors that may have protected against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: Descriptive study of an isolated population cohort, including SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and viral prevalence in samples of saliva assessed through RT-qPCR. We conducted seroprevalence screening from April 29 to May 3, 2020 across the three main settlements on the island. We invited the adult resident population, present on the island to undergo testing by rapid serologic assay and to provide a sample of saliva, which was cryopreserved for molecular validation. We monitored the participation through the official municipality residents list. Serologic testing was performed using a COVID-19 IgG/IgM rapid test while molecular analyses were carried out by Allplex 2019-nCoV Assay (Seegene). Results: A total of 634 residents out of 748 (84.8%) present at the time, and 89 non-residents underwent serological testing. 364 males and 359 females with a median age of 58.5 years.

To date, no work has assessed how this guidance differs across governments. OBJECTIVE: This study seeks to contribute to a rational and consistent global response to infectious disease by determining how guidelines differ across nations and regions. METHODS: A content analysis of health agency mask guidelines on agency websites was performed in late March 2020 among 25 countries and regions with large numbers of COVID-19 cases. Countries and regions were assigned across the coding team by language proficiency, with Google Translate used as needed. When available, both the original and English language version of guidance were reviewed. RESULTS: All examined countries and regions had some form of guidance online, although detail and clarity differed. Although 9 countries and regions recommended surgical, medical, or unspecified masks in public and poorly ventilated places, 16 recommended against people wearing masks in public. There were 2 countries that explicitly recommended against fabric masks. In addition, 12 failed to outline the minimum basic World Health Organization guidance for masks. CONCLUSIONS: Online guidelines for face mask use to prevent COVID-19 in the general public are currently inconsistent across nations and regions, and have been changing often. Efforts to create greater standardization and clarity should be explored in light of the status of COVID-19 as a global pandemic.","Laestadius, Linnea; Wang, Yang; Ben Taleb, Ziyad; Kalan, Mohammad Ebrahimi; Cho, Young; Manganello, Jennifer",JMIR Public Health Surveill,279,32

The effects of Reynolds number ([Formula: see text]) and blockage ratio [Formula: see text] on particle migration driven by pulsatile and non-pulsatile velocity are all numerically investigated for comparison. The results show that, different from non-pulsatile cases, the particle will migrate back to channel centerline with underdamped oscillation during the time period with zero-velocity in pulsatile cases. The maximum lateral travel distance of the particle in one cycle of periodic motion will increase with increasing [Formula: see text] , while [Formula: see text] has little impact. The quasi frequency of such oscillation has almost no business with [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text]. Moreover, [Formula: see text] plays an essential role in the damping ratio. Pulsatile flow field is ubiquitous in aorta and other arteries. This article is conducive to understanding nanoparticle migration in those arteries.","Huang, Lizhong; Du, Jiayou; Zhu, Zefei",Micromachines (Basel),279,21

Adult mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) infusions have the potential to benefit critically ill patients with acute respiratory syndrome SARS-COV-2 infection, but clinical data supporting efficacy are lacking. Methods: We conducted a case-control study of critically ill patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). To evaluate clinical responsiveness in the most critically ill patient we examined outcomes in a sub-group of those requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support. Patients (n=9) were administered with up to 3 infusions of intravenous (IV) MSCs and compared to a local ECMO control group (n=31). The primary outcome was safety, and the secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality (or rate of hospital discharge), cytokine levels, and viral clearance. Findings: MSC infusions (12 patients) were well tolerated and no side effects occurred. Of ECMO patients receiving MSC infusions, 2 out of 9 died (22.2%; 95%CI: 2.8%, 60.0%) compared with a mortality of 15 of 31 (48.4%; 95%CI: 30.2%, 66.9%; p = 0.25) in the ECMO control group. Isolated plasma exosomes containing the SARS-COV-2 Spike protein decreased after MSC infusions between day 14 or 21 after administration (p=0.003 and p=0.005, respectively) and was associated with a decrease in COVID-19 IgG Spike protein titer at same time points (p = 0.006 and p=0.007, respectively). Control ECMO patients receiving convalescent plasma did not clear COVID-19 IgG over the same time frame. Interpretation: Together these findings suggest that MSC IV infusion is well tolerated in patients with a broad range of severity including the most severe COVID-19 ARDS requiring ECMO. These data also raise the possibility that MSCs, in addition to exerting an immunomodulatory effect, contribute to viral clearance and strongly support the conduct of randomized placebo-controlled trial.","Kaushal, S.; Khan, A.; Deatrick, K.; Ng, D.
