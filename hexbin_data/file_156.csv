337,"Recode-2: new design, new search tools, and many more genes",2009-09-25,"‘Recoding’ is a term used to describe non-standard read-out of the genetic code, and encompasses such phenomena as programmed ribosomal frameshifting, stop codon readthrough, selenocysteine insertion and translational bypassing. Although only a small proportion of genes utilize recoding in protein synthesis, accurate annotation of ‘recoded’ genes lags far behind annotation of ‘standard’ genes. In order to address this issue, provide a service to researchers in the field, and offer training data for developers of gene-annotation software, we have gathered together known cases of recoding within the Recode database. Recode-2 is an improved and updated version of the database. It provides access to detailed information on genes known to utilize translational recoding and allows complex search queries, browsing of recoding data and enhanced visualization of annotated sequence elements. At present, the Recode-2 database stores information on approximately 1500 genes that are known to utilize recoding in their expression—a factor of approximately three increase over the previous version of the database. Recode-2 is available at http://recode.ucc.ie","Bekaert, Michaël; Firth, Andrew E.; Zhang, Yan; Gladyshev, Vadim N.; Atkins, John F.; Baranov, Pavel V.",Nucleic Acids Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2808893/,156
449,Alternative splicing of CD200 is regulated by an exonic splicing enhancer and SF2/ASF,2010-06-17,"CD200, a type I membrane glycoprotein, plays an important role in prevention of inflammatory disorders, graft rejection, autoimmune diseases and spontaneous fetal loss. It also regulates tumor immunity. A truncated CD200 (CD200(tr)) resulting from alternative splicing has been identified and characterized as a functional antagonist to full-length CD200. Thus, it is important to explore the mechanism(s) controlling alternative splicing of CD200. In this study, we identified an exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) located in exon 2, which is a putative binding site for a splicing regulatory protein SF2/ASF. Deletion or mutation of the ESE site decreased expression of the full-length CD200. Direct binding of SF2/ASF to the ESE site was confirmed by RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Knockdown of expression of SF2/ASF resulted in the same splicing pattern as seen after deletion or mutation of the ESE, whereas overexpression of SF2/ASF increased expression of the full-length CD200. In vivo studies showed that viral infection reversed the alternative splicing pattern of CD200 with increased expression of SF2/ASF and the full-length CD200. Taken together, our data suggest for the first time that SF2/ASF regulates the function of CD200 by controlling CD200 alternative splicing, through direct binding to an ESE located in exon 2 of CD200.","Chen, Zhiqi; Ma, Xuezhong; Zhang, Jianhua; Hu, Jim; Gorczynski, Reginald M.",Nucleic Acids Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2965252/,156
771,Using Support Vector Machine and Evolutionary Profiles to Predict Antifreeze Protein Sequences,2012-02-17,"Antifreeze proteins (AFPs) are ice-binding proteins. Accurate identification of new AFPs is important in understanding ice-protein interactions and creating novel ice-binding domains in other proteins. In this paper, an accurate method, called AFP_PSSM, has been developed for predicting antifreeze proteins using a support vector machine (SVM) and position specific scoring matrix (PSSM) profiles. This is the first study in which evolutionary information in the form of PSSM profiles has been successfully used for predicting antifreeze proteins. Tested by 10-fold cross validation and independent test, the accuracy of the proposed method reaches 82.67% for the training dataset and 93.01% for the testing dataset, respectively. These results indicate that our predictor is a useful tool for predicting antifreeze proteins. A web server (AFP_PSSM) that implements the proposed predictor is freely available.","Zhao, Xiaowei; Ma, Zhiqiang; Yin, Minghao",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3292016/,156
2296,Cytokine and Growth Factor Activation In Vivo and In Vitro after Spinal Cord Injury,2016-06-23,"Spinal cord injury results in a life-disrupting series of deleterious interconnected mechanisms encompassed by the primary and secondary injury. These events are mediated by the upregulation of genes with roles in inflammation, transcription, and signaling proteins. In particular, cytokines and growth factors are signaling proteins that have important roles in the pathophysiology of SCI. The balance between the proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects of these molecules plays a critical role in the progression and outcome of the lesion. The excessive inflammatory Th1 and Th17 phenotypes observed after SCI tilt the scale towards a proinflammatory environment, which exacerbates the deleterious mechanisms present after the injury. These mechanisms include the disruption of the spinal cord blood barrier, edema and ion imbalance, in particular intracellular calcium and sodium concentrations, glutamate excitotoxicity, free radicals, and the inflammatory response contributing to the neurodegenerative process which is characterized by demyelination and apoptosis of neuronal tissue.","Garcia, Elisa; Aguilar-Cevallos, Jorge; Silva-Garcia, Raul; Ibarra, Antonio",Mediators Inflamm,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4935915/,156
3619,Analysis of pig trading networks and practices in Uganda,2018-08-02,"East Africa is undergoing rapid expansion of pig rearing, driven by increasing pork consumption. Introduction and expansion of pig production systems in this biodiverse landscape may create new risks, including zoonotic pathogen transmission. Historically, biosecurity measures have primarily been focused at farm level, ignoring the important function pig traders fulfill between farmers and consumers. This study interviewed pig traders operating at Uganda’s only registered pork abattoir to describe their characteristics, business practices, biosecurity practices, and pig health management and reporting practices. All the traders were male, and nearly all (90.5%) relied on pig trading as their primary source of income. Most of the pigs brought for processing at the slaughterhouse were purchased from smallholder farms (87.3%). In addition, there was a significant difference in the high price paid per kilogram at farm gate by region (P = 0.005). High prices paid at farm gate were associated with holiday periods (P < 0.001), harvest season (P < 0.001), and drought (P < 0.001). Traders preferred buying live pigs from male farmers (88.9%) because they were considered the final decision makers and owned the pigs being sold. All pig traders were aware of clinical signs indicating a pig was sick. This study has provided baseline information on pig trader practices in Uganda. Improvements in local pork slaughterhouses and markets will benefit not only pig traders in accessing consistent customers but also individual pig farmers by increasing their market access. Finally, given their role as a link between farmers and consumers, traders would benefit from targeted inclusion in disease control and prevention strategies.

3949,Bioinformatic Study of Transcriptome Changes in the Mice Lumbar Spinal Cord After the 30-Day Spaceflight and Subsequent 7-Day Readaptation on Earth: New Insights Into Molecular Mechanisms of the Hypogravity Motor Syndrome,2019-07-11,"The hypogravity motor syndrome (HMS) is one of the deleterious impacts of weightlessness on the human body in orbital space missions. There is a hypothesis that disorders of musculoskeletal system as part of HMS arise in consequence of changes in spinal motor neurons. The study was aimed at bioinformatic analysis of transcriptome changes in lumbar spinal cords of mice after a 30-day spaceflight aboard biosatellite Bion-M1 (space group, S) and subsequent 7-day readaptation to the Earth’s gravity (recovery group, R) when compared with control mice (C group) housed in simulated biosatellite conditions on the Earth. Gene ontology and human phenotype ontology databases were used to detect biological processes, molecular functions, cellular components, and human phenotypes associated with HMS. Our results suggest resemblance of molecular changes developing in space orbit and during the postflight recovery to terrestrial neuromuscular disorders. Remarkably, more prominent transcriptome changes were revealed in R vs. S and R vs. C comparisons that are possibly related to the 7-day recovery period in the Earth’s gravity condition. These data may assist with establishment of HMS pathogenesis and proposing effective preventive and therapeutic options.","Kuznetsov, Maksim Sergeevich; Lisukov, Artur Nicolaevich; Rizvanov, Albert Anatolevich; Tyapkina, Oksana Victorovna; Gusev, Oleg Aleksandrovich; Rezvyakov, Pavel Nicolaevich; Kozlovskaya, Inessa Benedictovna; Tomilovskaya, Elena Sergeevna; Nikolskiy, Evgeny Evgenievich; Islamov, Rustem Robertovich",Front Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6637859/,156
4302,Advances in Directly Amplifying Nucleic Acids from Complex Samples,2019-09-30,"Advances in nucleic acid amplification technologies have revolutionized diagnostics for systemic, inherited, and infectious diseases. Current assays and platforms, however, often require lengthy experimental procedures and multiple instruments to remove contaminants and inhibitors from clinically-relevant, complex samples. This requirement of sample preparation has been a bottleneck for using nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) at the point of care (POC), though advances in “lab-on-chip” platforms that integrate sample preparation and NAATs have made great strides in this space. Alternatively, direct NAATs—techniques that minimize or even bypass sample preparation—present promising strategies for developing POC diagnostic tools for analyzing real-world samples. In this review, we discuss the current status of direct NAATs. Specifically, we surveyed potential testing systems published from 1989 to 2017, and analyzed their performances in terms of robustness, sensitivity, clinical relevance, and suitability for POC diagnostics. We introduce bubble plots to facilitate our analysis, as bubble plots enable effective visualization of the performances of these direct NAATs. Through our review, we hope to initiate an in-depth examination of direct NAATs and their potential for realizing POC diagnostics, and ultimately transformative technologies that can further enhance healthcare.","Walker, Faye M.; Hsieh, Kuangwen",Biosensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6955841/,156
4398,"Haloferax volcanii for biotechnology applications: challenges, current state and perspectives",2019-12-20,"Haloferax volcanii is an obligate halophilic archaeon with its origin in the Dead Sea. Simple laboratory culture conditions and a wide range of genetic tools have made it a model organism for studying haloarchaeal cell biology. Halophilic enzymes of potential interest to biotechnology have opened up the application of this organism in biocatalysis, bioremediation, nanobiotechnology, bioplastics and the biofuel industry. Functionally active halophilic proteins can be easily expressed in a halophilic environment, and an extensive genetic toolkit with options for regulated protein overexpression has allowed the purification of biotechnologically important enzymes from different halophiles in H. volcanii. However, corrosion mediated damage caused to stainless-steel bioreactors by high salt concentrations and a tendency to form biofilms when cultured in high volume are some of the challenges of applying H. volcanii in biotechnology. The ability to employ expressed active proteins in immobilized cells within a porous biocompatible matrix offers new avenues for exploiting H. volcanii in biotechnology. This review critically evaluates the various application potentials, challenges and toolkits available for using this extreme halophilic organism in biotechnology.","Haque, R.

Higher levels of both specific (51)Cr release and IFN were obtained in the assays containing PK-15-TGE cells. Co-cultivation of PBL from newborn piglets with PK-15-TGE cells yielded similar levels of IFN to those produced by co-cultivation of adult PBL and PK-15-TGE cells, but lower levels of IFN were produced by co-cultivation with uninfected PK-15 cells. Pretreatment of adult PBL with IFN augmented their SCMC effector activity for both PK-15 and PK-15-TGE cells in the (51)Cr release assay. Pretreatment of the PK-15-TGE target cells with IFN did not affect their release of (51)Cr in the SCMC reaction, while IFN pretreatment of PK-15 targets protected them against SCMC. In a single cell cytotoxicity assay the effects of IFN pretreatment on the effector adult PBL and on the PK-15 and PK-15-TGE target cells were confirmed, and SCMC incompetent PBL from neonatal piglets were rendered cytotoxic by pretreatment with IFN. PBL from newborn piglets bound to either target cell with the same frequency as PBL from SCMC competent adult pigs, and IFN pretreatment of either effector or target cells had no effect on target-binding frequency.","Cepica, A.; Derbyshire, J.B.",Vet Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7117231/,156

8674,Protection against feline infectious peritonitis by intranasal inoculation of a temperature-sensitive FIPV vaccine,2002-11-13,"After the death of a premature infant from rotavirus-associated necrotizing enterocolitis, we instituted prospective surveillance for this disease in our neonatal intensive care unit. During the 4-month study period an additional six cases of necrotizing enterocolitis and eight cases of hemorrhagic gastroenteritis occurred. Rotavirus infection was documented in 11 of these 15 symptomatic infants, in comparison with only eight rotavirus infections in 147 asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic bables (P<0.0001). Stools from 110 nursery personnel tested during the outbreak did not contain rotavirus. However, 12 of 59 staff members had serum IgM antibody against rotavirus, suggesting recent infection. In a case-control study we compared babies with severe gastrointestinal illness with a control group randomly selected from asymptomatic babies in the nursery during the time of the outbreak. Univariate analysis found six categorical variables and nine continuous variables that were significantly associated with disease. Multivariate logistic regression analysis, however, found only birth weight (P<0.0001), rotavirus infection (P<0.0001), and age at time of first nonwater feeding (P<0.02) to be associated with gastrointestinal illness. This study provides further evidence for the role of infection in some cases of neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis and hemorrhagic gastroenteritis.","Rotbart, Harley A.; Nelson, Wendy L.; Glode, Mary P.; Triffon, Theresa C.; Kogut, Sarah J.H.; Yolken, Robert H.; Hernandez, Jacinto A.; Levin, Myron J.",J Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131392/,156

Seven species of Euphausia and one of Thysanopoda migrated more than 300 m, rising to near the surface at night. Adults of Nematoscelis (three species) migrated vertically but were bounded at upper limits by the thermocline at all but the most inshore stations. Nyctiphanes simplex and Stylocheiron carinatum were short‐distance (ca. 150–0 m) migrants. The extent of vertical migration was greatest in the most offshore central water, intermediate for midcurrent species, and least for coastal. Nonmigrants included all Stylocheiron species (except S. carinatum), Thysanoessa gregaria, and two Nematobrachion species. S. affine, S. suhmi, and T. gregaria inhabited the homogeneous layer.

10137,COMPILED BY THE VACCINATION GUIDELINES GROUP (VGG) OF THE WORLD SMALL ANIMAL VETERINARY ASSOCIATION (WSAVA),2007-09-03,"Neurotropic strains of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) have been used extensively for the study of viral pathogenesis in the central nervous system (CNS), serving as models for human neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). MHV strains A59 and JHMV both cause acute and chronic encephalomyelitis and demyelination in susceptible strains of mice and rats. In acute disease, CNS damage is most likely the result of lytic infection in neurons and oligodendrocytes, and death can be prevented by the adoptive transfer of Class I‐restricted CD8+ T cells. However, in later stages of the disease induced by some MHV strains, virus tends to be restricted to astrocytes in a nonlytic infection, and the immune response appears to contribute to CNS damage. These data lead us to suggest that the astrocyte may play a central role in the neuropathogenesis of MHV infection. Consistent with this possibility, A59 has been reported to induce the expression of Class I molecules of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in glial cells following infection in vivo and in vitro. In this communication, we have examined the influence of persistent infection by both A59 and JHMV on MHC Class I expression in primary murine astrocytes. Persistence was characterized by the presence of intracellular viral antigen and mRNA in the absence of detectable infectious virus particles. Under these conditions, JHMV, but not A59, inhibited constitutive expression of the H‐2 K(b) molecule, with the magnitude of inhibition increasing with postinfection time. A59 was not able to induce Class I during persistence, presumably due to the lack of infectious virus particles. Class I expression was restored by the addition of gamma‐interferon (IFN‐γ) to astrocytes persistently infected with either A59 or JHMV. Thus, Class I inhibition is not a permanent consequence of JHMV persistence, and persistence does not interfere with normal signalling pathways for Class I induction. © 1995 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.","Correale, J.; Li, S.; Weiner, L.

11331,Dietary supplementation with Withania somnifera root powder ameliorates experimentally induced Infectious Bursal Disease in chicken,2019-11-09,"PURPOSE: Recently, some attempts have been made to integrate lung ultrasound (LUS) teaching into medical curricula. However, current education studies of LUS are extremely heterogeneous due to the lack of evidence-based guidelines on LUS education. In particular, the assessment of competencies is poorly standardized and mostly relies on non-validated scales. A new validated tool, the objective structured assessment of lung ultrasound skills (LUS-OSAUS), has the potential to overcome these limitations. Therefore, we adopted the LUS-OSAUS tool to assess the competencies of a group of LUS-trained undergraduates. Existing no prior practical applications of the LUS-OSAUS, our aim was to investigate the practical utility of this tool and its applicability in the evaluation of US-trained medical students. METHODS: Eight undergraduates (two males, six females) were enrolled on a voluntary basis to receive a theoretical and practical training in LUS. Once completed their training, each student performed an LUS examination on a different patient hospitalized for respiratory symptoms. The same eight patients were also scanned by a senior resident in emergency medicine for a comparison with students’ results. Students and the senior resident were tested by an examiner using the LUS-OSAUS tool. We compared the scores obtained by operators in all areas of competence of the LUS-OSAUS, the total scores, and the time needed to complete the sonographic task. RESULTS: Median students’ score in the single items of the scale was significantly lower than the ones obtained by the senior resident (4.0 [3.3–5.0] vs. 5.0 [5.0–5.0]; p < 0.0001). Students scored significantly lower than the senior resident in each item, except for B-line identification, choice of the correct transducer, and suggested focused questions. Median total score was also lower for students compared to the senior resident (70.5 [61.0–74.8] vs. 84.0 [83.5–84.3] (p = 0.0116). Median time required to complete the examination was significantly higher for students (14.1 [12.8–16.1] vs. 4.7 [3.9–5.2] min, p = 0.0117). CONCLUSIONS: The LUS-OSAUS tool allowed for a standardized and comprehensive assessment of student’s competencies in lung ultrasound, and helped to discriminate their level of expertise from that of a more experienced operator. The scale also specifically tests the theoretical knowledge of trainees, thus making redundant the use of questionnaires designed for this purpose.

12181,Secretion of Streptomyces mobaraensis pro-transglutaminase by coryneform bacteria,2008-03-01,"Inorganic phosphate is an essential nutrient. In general, microorganisms take up phosphorus when the extracellular phosphorus concentration is low, but not when it is high. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the major phosphate transporters, such as Pho84p, and acid phosphatases (APases), such as Pho5p, are regulated in parallel by the phosphate signal transduction pathway (PHO pathway). We found that PHO mutants expressing PHO84 and PHO5, even under high-P conditions, could take up phosphorus at twice the rate of the wild-type strain. The regulatory pathway for phosphorus accumulation in two wastewater treatment yeasts, Hansenula fabianii J640 and Hansenula anomala J224-1, was found to be similar to that in S. cerevisiae. We screened for mutants of these yeasts that constitutively expressed APase. Such mutants formed blue colonies on high phosphorus concentration agar plates containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate (X-phosphate). We found four mutants of H. fabianii J640 and one mutant of H. anomala J224-1 that accumulated from 2.2 to 3.5 times more phosphorus than the parent strains.

12183,"Competition and coexistence of sulfate-reducing bacteria, acetogens and methanogens in a lab-scale anaerobic bioreactor as affected by changing substrate to sulfate ratio",2008-04-01,"The length of the published glycoprotein (G) gene sequences of avian metapneumovirus subtype-C (aMPV-C) isolated from domestic turkeys and wild birds in the United States (1996–2003) remains controversial. To explore the G gene size variation in aMPV-C by the year of isolation and cell culture passage levels, we examined 21 turkey isolates of aMPV-C at different cell culture passages. The early domestic turkey isolates of aMPV-C (aMPV/CO/1996, aMPV/MN/1a-b, and 2a-b/97) had a G gene of 1,798 nucleotides (nt) that coded for a predicted protein of 585 amino acids (aa) and showed >97% nt similarity with that of aMPV-C isolated from Canada geese. This large G gene got truncated upon serial passages in Vero cell cultures by deletion of 1,015 nt near the end of the open reading frame. The recent domestic turkey isolates of aMPV-C lacked the large G gene but instead had a small G gene of 783 nt, irrespective of cell culture passage levels. In some cultures, both large and small genes were detected, indicating the existence of a mixed population of the virus. Apparently, serial passage of aMPV-C in cell cultures and natural passage in turkeys in the field led to truncation of the G gene, which may be a mechanism of virus evolution for survival in a new host or environment.","Velayudhan, Binu T.; Yu, Qingzhong; Estevez, Carlos N.; Nagaraja, Kakambi V.; Halvorson, David A.",Virus Genes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2516547/,156
12184,Determination of fungal activity in modified wood by means of micro-calorimetry and determination of total esterase activity,2008-08-01,"A gene encoding an α-l-arabinofuranosidase, designated SaAraf43A, was cloned from Streptomyces avermitilis. The deduced amino acid sequence implies a modular structure consisting of an N-terminal glycoside hydrolase family 43 module and a C-terminal family 42 carbohydrate-binding module (CBM42). The recombinant enzyme showed optimal activity at pH 6.0 and 45°C and was stable over the pH range of 5.0–6.5 at 30°C. The enzyme hydrolyzed p-nitrophenol (PNP)-α-l-arabinofuranoside but did not hydrolyze PNP-α-l-arabinopyranoside, PNP-β-d-xylopyranoside, or PNP-β-d-galactopyranoside. Debranched 1,5-arabinan was hydrolyzed by the enzyme but arabinoxylan, arabinogalactan, gum arabic, and arabinan were not. Among the synthetic regioisomers of arabinofuranobiosides, only methyl 5-O-α-l-arabinofuranosyl-α-l-arabinofuranoside was hydrolyzed by the enzyme, while methyl 2-O-α-l-arabinofuranosyl-α-l-arabinofuranoside and methyl 3-O-α-l-arabinofuranosyl-α-l-arabinofuranoside were not. These data suggested that the enzyme only cleaves α-1,5-linked arabinofuranosyl linkages. The analysis of the hydrolysis product of arabinofuranopentaose suggested that the enzyme releases arabinose in exo-acting manner. These results indicate that the enzyme is definitely an exo-1,5-α-l-arabinofuranosidase. The C-terminal CBM42 did not show any affinity for arabinogalactan and debranched arabinan, although it bound arabinan and arabinoxylan, suggesting that the CBM42 bound to branched arabinofuranosyl residues. Removal of the module decreased the activity of the enzyme with regard to debranched arabinan. The CBM42 plays a role in enhancing the debranched arabinan hydrolytic action of the catalytic module in spite of its preference for binding arabinofuranosyl side chains.","Ichinose, Hitomi; Yoshida, Makoto; Fujimoto, Zui; Kaneko, Satoshi",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2518083/,156

Sulfate reduction activities of the reactor biomass with acetate and formate were sufficiently high to explain the sulfate reduction rates that are required for the process. Two citrate-fermenting bacteria were isolated. Strain R210 was closest related to Trichococcus pasteurii (99.5% ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequence similarity).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-six patients were identified retrospectively as having comparative 1.5 and 3.0 T MR studies of the knee within an average of 102 days. Standard protocols included T1-weighted and fat-saturated intermediate-weighted fast spin-echo sequences in three planes; sequence parameters had been adjusted to account for differences in relaxation at 3.0 T. Arthroscopy was performed in 19 patients. Four radiologists reviewed each study independently, scored image quality, and analyzed pathological findings. Sensitivities, specificities, and accuracies in diagnosing cartilage lesions were calculated in the 19 patients with arthroscopy, and differences between 1.5 and 3.0 T exams were compared using paired Student’s t tests with a significance threshold of p < 0.05. RESULTS: Each radiologist scored the 3.0 T studies higher than those obtained at 1.5 T in visualizing anatomical structures and abnormalities (p < 0.05). Using arthroscopy as a standard of reference, diagnosis of cartilage abnormalities was improved at 3.0 T with higher sensitivity (75.7% versus 70.6%), accuracy (88.2% versus 86.4%), and correct grading of cartilage lesions (51.3% versus 42.9%). Diagnostic confidence scores were higher at 3.0 than 1.5 T (p < 0.05) and signal-to-noise ratio at 3.0 T was approximately twofold higher than at 1.5 T. CONCLUSION: MRI at 3.0 T improved visualization of anatomical structures and improved diagnostic confidence compared to 1.5 T. This resulted in significantly better sensitivity and grading of cartilage lesions at the knee.","Wong, Scott; Steinbach, Lynne; Zhao, Jian; Stehling, Christoph; Ma, C.

12198,Behavioral response of dissimilatory perchlorate-reducing bacteria to different electron acceptors,2009-06-17,"Three sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) were operated in parallel to study the effects of trace erythromycin (ERY) and ERY-H(2)O on the treatment of a synthetic wastewater. Through monitoring (1) daily effluents and (2) concentrations of nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) in certain batch cycles of the three reactors operated from transient to steady states, the removal of carbon, N, and P was affected negligibly by ERY (100 µg/L) or ERY-H(2)O (50 µg/L) when compared with the control reactor. However, through analyzing microbial communities of the three steady state SBRs on high-density microarrays (PhyloChip), ERY, and ERY-H(2)O had pronounced effects on the community composition of bacteria related to N and P removal, leading to diversity loss and abundance change. The above observations indicated that resistant bacteria were selected upon exposure to ERY or ERY-H(2)O. Short-term batch experiments further proved the resistance and demonstrated that ammonium oxidation (56–95%) was inhibited more significantly than nitrite oxidation (18–61%) in the presence of ERY (100, 400, or 800 µg/L). Therefore, the presence of ERY or ERY-H(2)O (at µg/L levels) shifted the microbial community and selected resistant bacteria, which may account for the negligible influence of the antibiotic ERY or its derivative ERY-H(2)O (at µg/L levels) on carbon, N, and P removal in the SBRs.

12223,Post-mortem volatiles of vertebrate tissue,2011-07-01,"Recently discovered microorganisms affiliated to the bacterial phylum NC10, named “Candidatus Methylomirabilis oxyfera”, perform nitrite-dependent anaerobic methane oxidation. These microorganisms could be important players in a novel way of anaerobic wastewater treatment where ammonium and residual dissolved methane might be removed at the expense of nitrate or nitrite. To find suitable inocula for reactor startup, ten selected wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) located in The Netherlands were screened for the endogenous presence of M. oxyfera using molecular diagnostic methods. We could identify NC10 bacteria with 98% similarity to M. oxyfera in nine out of ten WWTPs tested. Sludge from one selected WWTP was used to start a new enrichment culture of NC10 bacteria. This enrichment was monitored using specific pmoA primers and M. oxyfera cells were visualized with fluorescence oligonucleotide probes. After 112 days, the enrichment consumed up to 0.4 mM NO(2)(−) per day.

12543,Branched chain aldehydes: production and breakdown pathways and relevance for flavour in foods,2009-01-01,"In 1994, the “danger model” argued that adaptive immune responses are driven rather by molecules released upon tissue damage than by the recognition of “strange” molecules. Thus, an alternative to the “self versus non-self recognition model” has been provided. The model, which suggests that the immune system discriminates dangerous from safe molecules, has established the basis for the future designation of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), a term that was coined by Walter G. Land, Seong, and Matzinger. The pathological importance of DAMPs is barely somewhere else evident as in the posttraumatic or post-surgical inflammation and regeneration. Since DAMPs have been identified to trigger specific immune responses and inflammation, which is not necessarily detrimental but also regenerative, it still remains difficult to describe their “friend or foe” role in the posttraumatic immunogenicity and healing process. DAMPs can be used as biomarkers to indicate and/or to monitor a disease or injury severity, but they also may serve as clinically applicable parameters for optimized indication of the timing for, i.e., secondary surgeries. While experimental studies allow the detection of these biomarkers on different levels including cellular, tissue, and circulatory milieu, this is not always easily transferable to the human situation. Thus, in this review, we focus on the recent literature dealing with the pathophysiological importance of DAMPs after traumatic injury. Since dysregulated inflammation in traumatized patients always implies disturbed resolution of inflammation, so-called model of suppressing/inhibiting inducible DAMPs (SAMPs) will be very briefly introduced. Thus, an update on this topic in the field of trauma will be provided.","Relja, Borna; Land, Walter Gottlieb",Eur J Trauma Emerg Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7427761/,156

The process operates at natron-alkaline conditions (>1 mol L(−1) of sodium- and potassium carbonates and a pH of 8.5–10) to enable the treatment of gases with a high partial CO(2) pressure. In the process, methanethiol reacts with biologically produced sulfur particles to form a complex mixture predominantly consisting of inorganic polysulfides, dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), and dimethyl trisulfide (DMTS). The effect of these organic sulfur compounds on the biological oxidation of sulfide to elemental sulfur was studied with natron-alkaliphilic bacteria belonging to the genus Thioalkalivibrio. Biological oxidation rates were reduced by 50% at 0.05 mM methanethiol, while for DMDS and DMTS, this was estimated to occur at 1.5 and 1.0 mM, respectively. The inhibiting effect of methanethiol on biological sulfide oxidation diminished due to its reaction with biologically produced sulfur particles. This reaction increases the feasibility of biotechnological treatment of gases containing both hydrogen sulfide and methanethiol at natron-alkaline conditions.","van den Bosch, Pim L.

In anaerobic environments, carbohydrates are converted into volatile fatty acids and alcohols. These can be used as building blocks in biotechnological or chemical processes, e.g., to produce bioplastics. In this study, xylose fermentation by mixed microbial cultures was investigated and compared with glucose under the same conditions. The product spectrum obtained with both substrates was comparable. It was observed that, in the case of xylose, a higher fraction of the carbon was converted into catabolic products (butyrate, acetate, and ethanol) and the biomass yield was approximately 20% lower than on glucose, 0.16 versus 0.21 Cmol X/Cmol S. This lower yield is likely related to the need of an extra ATP during xylose uptake. When submitted to a pulse of glucose, the population cultivated on xylose could instantaneously convert the glucose. No substrate preference was observed when glucose and xylose were fed simultaneously to the continuously operated bioreactor.","Temudo, Margarida F.; Mato, Tania; Kleerebezem, Robbert; van Loosdrecht, Mark C.

C4 were investigated. Comprehensive metabolites profiles, including polar metabolites, fatty acids, and polyhydroxyalkanoates were evaluated through untargeted metabolome analyses. Intracellular metabolomes during the degradation of phenanthrene were compared with those from natural carbon sources. Principal component analysis showed a clear separation of metabolomes of phenanthrene degradation from other carbon sources. Shift to more hydrophobic fatty acid was observed from the analysis of fatty acid methyl ester. Polyhydroxyalkanoate from strain C4 was composed mainly with 3-hydroxybutyric acid and small amount of 3-hydroxypentanoic acid, while the monomeric composition was independent on carbon sources. However, the amount of polyhydroxyalkanoates during degradation of phenanthrene was 50–210% less than those from other carbon sources. Among 207 gas chromatography–mass spectrometry peaks from the polar metabolite fraction, 60% of the peaks were identified and compared. Several intermediates in tricarboxylic acid cycles and glycolysis were increased during phenanthrene degradation. Accumulation of trehalose was also evident in the phenanthrene-treated bacterium. Some amino acid, including branched amino acids, glycine, homoserine, and valine, were also increased, while more than 70% of identified metabolites were decreased during the phenanthrene metabolism. Accumulation of sulfur amino acids and nicotinic acid suggested the possible oxidative stress conditions during phenanthrene metabolism.","Keum, Young Soo; Seo, Jong Su; Li, Qing X.; Kim, Jeong Han",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7419452/,156

Although there are several reports reviewing abdominal complications occurring with anterior spinal fusion, complications related to posterior spinal fusion (PSF) are rare. However, abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) after PSF could be the most fatal and unpredictable complication in spinal surgery. CASE PRESENTATION: This 73-year-old man with body mass index (BMI) of 23.02, and surgical history of appendectomy 10 years prior complained of severe nausea and vomiting on the second postoperative day of L4–5 transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF). By postoperative day 4, he presented with dyspnea and fever, and the first diagnostic impression suggested aspiration pneumonia due to vomiting. Physical examination revealed severe abdominal distention and tenderness to palpation at most of the abdomen. Computed tomography (CT) scan of abdomen and chest revealed left inguinal hernia of the small bowel with incarceration suggesting intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH), and multifocal peri-bronchial consolidation in both lungs, respectively. His respiratory symptoms progressed to respiratory failure, and he was finally mechanically ventilated in conjunction with antibiotics. After 2 weeks of intensive care, the patient’s symptom had improved, and finally he was transferred to a nursing facility. DISCUSSION: IAH and ACS rarely occur as abdominal complications of PSF. We suggest several risk factors including body mass index, abdominal surgical history, and long segment fusion for development of abdominal complications.","Oh, Hyeong-Cheol; Kim, Hyeun-Sung; Park, Jeong-Yoon",Spinal Cord Ser Cases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6786363/,156

We present our experience with such a case where all known etiologies were ruled out and the cause of deterioration could not be conclusively identified. The course was found to be similar to sub-acute post-traumatic ascending myelopathy (SPAM). However, the condition has only been described for traumatic injuries so far. CASE PRESENTATION: Our patient presented a history of back pain and associated gait instability for one and a half months. There was no history of trauma. Investigations suggested an Anderson-like lesion at T11–T12 with cord edema at the same level suggestive of instability. She underwent posterior stabilization T9 to L2 and laminectomy of T11 as well as T12 under neuromonitoring. The postoperative sequence of events included an episode of pyrexia on the fifth day of surgery, neurological deterioration from the seventh day of surgery proceeding to complete paraplegia by the fourteenth day, no response to steroid treatment and no signs of recovery till two years post surgery. MRI findings were suggestive of SPAM, and there was no evidence of infection. DISCUSSION: Ascending myelopathy is a potential but rare cause of delayed deterioration in neurological status after surgical intervention. MRI findings of cord edema extending more than four levels above the involved segments is a characteristic finding of the condition. Ascending myelopathy may lead to complete cord injury. The precise cause of the condition is unknown and prognosis remains poor.","Kalidindi, Kalyan Kumar Varma; Gupta, Mayank; Chhabra, Harvinder Singh",Spinal Cord Ser Cases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6786435/,156
13110,Role of lordotic rod contouring in thoracic myelopathy: a technical note,2019-08-22,"Activation of microglia and the subsequently elevated inflammatory cytokine release in the brain during surgery predispose individuals to cognitive dysfunction, also known as postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). miR-124 is one of the most abundant microRNAs in the brain that regulates microglial function. Elucidating the role of miR-124 in microglial activation in the context of surgery may therefore promote understanding of as well as therapeutic development for post-surgical disorders involving microglial activation. The downstream targets of miR-124 were investigated using bioinformatic screening and dual-luciferase reporter assay validation, and vesicle-associated membrane protein 3 (VAMP3) was identified as a potential target. The kinetics of miR-124/VAMP3 expression was first examined in vitro in microglial cells (primary microglia and BV2 microglial cells) following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. LPS induced a time-dependent decrease of miR-124 and upregulated the expression of VAMP3. Manipulating miR-124/VAMP3 expression by using miR-124 mimics or VAMP3-specific siRNA in LPS-stimulated BV2 microglial cells inhibited BV2 microglial activation-associated inflammatory cytokine release. To further examine the role of miR-124/VAMP3 in a surgical setting, we employed a rat surgical trauma model. Significant microglial activation and altered miR-124/VAMP3 expression were observed following surgical trauma. We also altered miR-124/VAMP3 expression in the rat surgical trauma model by administration of exogenous miR-124 and by using electroacupuncture, which is a clinically applicable treatment that modulates microglial function and minimizes postoperative disorders. We determined that electroacupuncture treatment specifically increases the expression of miR-124 in the hypothalamus and hippocampus. Increased miR-124 expression with a concomitant decrease in VAMP3 expression resulted in decreased inflammatory cytokine release related to microglial activation post-surgery. Our study indicates that miR-124/VAMP3 is involved in surgery-induced microglial activation and that targeting miR-124/VAMP3 could be a potential therapeutic strategy for postoperative disorders involving microglial activation.","Chen, Yan; Sun, Jing-xian; Chen, Wan-kun; Wu, Gen-cheng; Wang, Yan-qing; Zhu, Ke-ying; Wang, Jun",Signal Transduct Target Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6799846/,156

Over two-thirds of species exhibited diel responses to mainly diurnal human presence, with ungulate nocturnal activity increasing by 7.1%. Rather than traditional pairwise predator-prey diel comparisons, we considered spatiotemporally explicit predator access to several prey resources to evaluate community-level trophic responses to human presence. Although leopard prey access was not affected by humans, lion and spotted hyena access to three prey species significantly increased when prey increased their nocturnal activity to avoid humans. Human presence considerably influenced the composition of available prey, with implications for prey selection, demonstrating how humans perturb ecological processes via behavioral modifications.","Mills, Kirby L; Harris, Nyeema C",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7673783/,156

19860,Seeing Keratinocyte Proteins through the Looking Glass of Intrinsic Disorder,2021-07-24,"Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging arbovirus with recent global expansion. Historically, ZIKV infections with Asian lineages have been associated with mild disease such as rash and fever. However, recent Asian sub-lineages have caused outbreaks in the South Pacific and Latin America with increased prevalence of neurological disorders in infants and adults. Asian sub-lineage differences may partially explain the range of disease severity observed. However, the effect of Asian sub-lineage differences on pathogenesis remains poorly characterized. Current study conducts a head-to-head comparison of three Asian sub-lineages that are representative of the circulating ancestral mild Asian strain (ZIKV-SG), the 2007 epidemic French Polynesian strain (ZIKV-FP), and the 2013 epidemic Brazil strain (ZIKV-Brazil) in adult Cynomolgus macaques. Animals infected intervenously or subcutaneously with either of the three clinical isolates showed sub-lineage-specific differences in viral pathogenesis, early innate immune responses and systemic inflammation. Despite the lack of neurological symptoms in infected animals, the epidemiologically neurotropic ZIKV sub-lineages (ZIKV-Brazil and/or ZIKV-FP) were associated with more sustained viral replication, higher systemic inflammation (i.e. higher levels of TNFα, MCP-1, IL15 and G-CSF) and greater percentage of CD14+ monocytes and dendritic cells in blood. Multidimensional analysis showed clustering of ZIKV-SG away from ZIKV-Brazil and ZIKV-FP, further confirming sub-lineage differences in the measured parameters. These findings highlight greater systemic inflammation and monocyte recruitment as possible risk factors of adult ZIKV disease observed during the 2007 FP and 2013 Brazil epidemics. Future studies should explore the use of anti-inflammatory therapeutics as early treatment to prevent ZIKV-associated disease in adults.","de Alwis, Ruklanthi; Zellweger, Raphaël M.; Chua, Edmond; Wang, Lin-Fa; Chawla, Tanu; Sessions, October M.; Marlier, Damien; Connolly, John E.; von Messling, Veronika; Anderson, Danielle E.",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8300938/,156
23526,"Contents of veterinary microbiology, volume 20",2002-11-13,"Early recognition of patients who might potentially require ventilatory support is a key goal of critical care outreach programmes and an important skill for all hospital medical staff. Decisions about the initiation and timing of invasive ventilation can be difficult, and early discussion with critical care colleagues is essential. Appropriateness of invasive ventilatory support can also require advanced discussion with patients and families. In the past 10–15 years, the role of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) has expanded, not least in an attempt to minimize the complications inherent in invasive ventilation. Indeed, NIV is now considered first-line therapy in some conditions (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary oedema, mild to moderate hypoxaemic respiratory failure in immunocompromised patients), and a ‘trial of NIV’ is often considered in respiratory failure resulting from an increasingly wide range of causes. With NIV, the importance of the environment (setting, monitoring, experience of staff) and forward planning cannot be overemphasized. When used for other than the standard indications, NIV should be employed in a high-dependency or intensive care setting in patients for whom invasive ventilation would be considered.","Popat, Bhavesh; Jones, Andrew T.",Medicine (Abingdon),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108337/,156

The aim of this study is to identify and summarize the focus areas of studies that applied TTF, the environment in which it was applied, and the technologies which were considered by conducting a scoping review. It was found that applied studies focused primarily on generating theory or assessing certain real-world phenomena; was applied in a wide range of environments with the majority being in healthcare; and considered various technologies, with an increasing number of studies focusing on mobile technology. The findings of this study contribute to the understanding of TTF applications and assists in framing future research to further analyze TTF studies.","Spies, Ruan; Grobbelaar, Sara; Botha, Adele","Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134276/,156

These benefits include improved, data driven decision-making, which can lead to deeper insight into business operations and as a result better performing organisations. Not surprisingly, an increased number of organisations are researching best implementation practices for BDA projects. Similar to software projects, research has shown that many BDA projects fail or do not deliver the business value as promised. To address this issue, the main objective of this research is to identify BDA implementation considerations for new BDA endeavors that will help organisations to align their BDA efforts with their overall business strategy to maximize business value. Based on a Benefit Dependency Network (BDN) model as main theoretical underpinning, a structured literature review was conducted focusing on investment objectives, business benefits, enabling changes and IT enablers when implementing BDA. A BDA implementation requires a holistic approach by considering aspects such as the skills of people which will have an impact on the structure of the organisation, business processes and technology changes to deliver benefits and investment objectives. Each of the domains of the BDN should be considered prior to BDA implementations. The research offers a guideline to organisations implementing BDA, based on the foundation of BDN.","Maritz, Juane; Eybers, Sunet; Hattingh, Marie","Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134384/,156

As opposed to previous work, we focus on exploratory settings, which we support with a visual representation of graph structures, helping users to better understand relationships. In addition, our approach keeps track of context – an important challenge in SQA – by allowing users to make their focus explicit via subgraph selection.

The planning in regard to further action for the coming weeks and months has to take place now. METHODS: With the help of the principles of the German philosopher Kant, the thinking and planning is framed. RESULTS: The modelling by the researchers of the Imperial College, London, make an oversized second wave in autumn/winter 2020 most likely, if the current countermeasures are kept in place for too long. A timely relaxation of the measures is warranted to allow a staggered attack by the virus onto the population (German: “Durchseuchung”) before the next influenza season 2020/2021 without overburdening the health care infrastructure especially the respiratory care bed capacity. The tempting perspective of a vaccine available before the second wave in autumn, should not lead to any delay in the intermittent relaxation of the countermeasures. A pre-licensure marginally tested vaccine would only be eligible for people with an anyway high risk in regard to SARS-CoV‑2. CONCLUSIONS: Further, more detailed and from each other independent models on the basis of data from Germany are urgently needed. Upon these a heterogeneous trans-hierarchical committee would need to discuss and make decisions in regard to differentiated relaxations of measures given the high remaining uncertainties.","Weigl, Josef",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149306/,156

30831,Acquired immune‐mediated myasthenia gravis in a cat associated with a cystic thymus,2008-04-10,"All vascular plant species were listed on eight sites near Sydney, Australia. Four sites were on infertile and four on fertile soil. Each of the 355 species was classified according to seed mass (measured as fresh mass of embryo plus endosperm), morphological adaptations for dispersal by different vectors, and growth form. The infertile—soil sites had more species and more cover adapted for dispersal by ants, and the fertile—soil sites had more species and more cover with fleshy fruits adapted for dispersal by vertebrates. We tested the hypothesis that this difference could be interpreted as a secondary correlate of seed size or of growth form. Species with smaller seed mass of growing to <2 m tall were significantly more likely to be adapted for dispersal by ants relative to vertebrates. An indirect association via growth form was capable of accounting for up to 84% of the relationship between soil type and dispersal mode, and indirect association via seed mass for up to 23% of the relationship; the two together could account for a maximum of 85%. The indirect association association via seed mass relatively weaker because seed masses proved not to be very different between these soil types. There remained a significant residual tendency for species in any given seed size class and growth form to be more likely to be dispersed by vertebrates relative to ants on fertile soils than on infertile soils.","Westoby, Mark; Rice, Barbara; Howell, Jocelyn",Ecology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7163505/,156

Evidence indicates that lactic acid bacteria (LAB), e.g. lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, have beneficial effects on the host. Established health effects include increased gut maturation, antagonisms towards pathogens and immune modulation. The objective of this study is to evaluate the immunomodulating properties of a range of LAB of human origin. As dendritic cells (DCs) play a pivotal role in the balance between tolerance and immunity to commensal microorganisms, in vitro‐generated immature DCs serve as a suitable model for studying the immunomodulating effects of lab. Human immature DCs were generated in vitro from monocytes and exposed to lethally UV‐irradiated LAB. The effect of various species of LAB on DCs in direct contact was evaluated. Furthermore, the maturation pattern of DCs separated from the bacteria by an epithelial cell layer (CaCo‐2 cells), which should mimic the intestinal environment, was studied. Cytokine secretion (IL‐12, IL‐10 and TNF‐α) and upregulation of maturation surface markers on DCs (CD83 and CD86) was measured. Different LAB induced diverse cytokine responses. Some strains were strong IL‐12 and TNF‐α inducers and others weak. All strains induced IL‐10. Different LAB also differentially modulated expression of CD83 and CD86 on DCs. Although some variation in the response to LAB of DCs generated from different blood donors was observed, general differences in the effect of the various LAB was revealed. Experiments with the DC CaCo‐2 coculture system are ongoing. Different species of LAB differentially affect DC maturation; this suggets that the gut flora plays a pivotal role in polarization of the immune response.","Hjerrild, L.; Christensen, H.

The obligatory receptor components of two new CSHs (irisin and growth differentiation factor-15 [GDF15]) were recently discovered. Irisin binds integrin-αV/β5 heterodimers while GDF-15 binds to the orphan receptor glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family receptor α-like (GFRAL). In addition, integrin-αV/β5 was just identified as the key receptor mediating Zika virus infection in the CNS. We measured integrin-αV, integrin-β5, and GFRAL protein levels across 78 high-quality human male/female brain tissues in infants, toddlers, preschoolers, adolescent, and adults—providing the most robust analysis to date on their levels in the human cortex and hippocampus. We report that integrin-αV was detected at all ages in the prefrontal cortex with levels greatest in adults. Integrin-αV was also detected in the hippocampus in all age groups. In contrast, integrin-β5 was detected in cortex and hippocampus largely restricted to infants. Co-expression of integrin-αV/β5 in the human infant hippocampus and cortex suggests the possibility that irisin has a more robust effect on the developing vs. the adult brain and may have implications for Zika virus infection in infants and young children.

59767,Smart Nucleic Acids as Future Therapeutics.,2021-05-10,"PURPOSE To investigate the attitudes and understanding of optometrists in the UK and Ireland towards Digital Eye Strain (DES), and to examine related practice patterns. METHODS An anonymous online questionnaire was developed, covering attitude and understanding of DES, examination of patients who may be experiencing DES and approaches to management options. The questionnaire was promoted to UK and Ireland optometrists via professional bodies and local and area optometric committees. RESULTS 406 responses were included in the analysis. Most respondents agreed that DES was an important concern for optometrists (88.9%). 91.4% reported they felt confident in discussing possible symptoms of DES and management options; this was weakly and negatively associated with number of years qualified (rs = -0.198, p ≤ 0.001). Estimations of the proportion of patients affected by DES were lower than reports in the literature (median 25%, IQR 10%-50%). Most respondents always (60.6%) or frequently (21.9%) inquired about device usage in routine case history taking, and also asked follow-up questions, although 29.3% only asked about the presence of symptoms half the time or less. Advising on regular breaks (84.0%), lubricants (55.7%) and environment/set up (69.2%) were felt to be extremely or very important by most respondents. Advising on specialist spectacle lenses, specifically blue filtering designs, was considered extremely or very important by 34.2% and 15.2%, respectively. CONCLUSION Given the agreement that DES is a significant issue causing frequent and persistent symptoms, and practitioners reported high levels of confidence in discussing DES, patients can expect to receive advice on symptoms and management from their optometrist. Simple management strategies were felt to be most important to advise on, with more uncertainty linked to specialist spectacle lenses.","Moore, Patrick A; Wolffsohn, James S; Sheppard, Amy L",Ophthalmic & physiological optics : the journal of the British College of Ophthalmic Opticians,https://doi.org/10.1111/opo.12887; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34545597/,156
60009,Virtual laboratory lessons in enzymology.,2020-06-30,"The understanding of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has significantly expanded over the last two decades. The elucidation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) that converts angiotensin (Ang) II into Ang (1-7) led to the discovery of the cardio-protective axis of the RAS. In addition, novel components of the system, Angiotensin A (Ang A) and alamandine have been identified. Like Ang (1-7), alamandine is a vasodilator and can counteract the effects of Ang II by increasing nitric oxide release from the endothelium and decreasing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (NADPH)-related superoxide production. Theoretically, alamandine can be derived from Ang (1-7) by decarboxylation of the N-terminal aspartic acid residue to alanine, but the enzyme responsible for this is still unknown. To date, no human or mammalian enzyme with the assigned decarboxylase activity has been identified. However, several bacterial enzymes capable of converting aspartate to alanine have been reported. Therefore, we hypothesize that a bacterial enzyme, most likely present in the microbiome of the gastrointestinal tract, the heart, or systemic circulation could metabolize Ang II, and/or Ang 1-7, to Ang A and alamandine, respectively, in mammals.","Jha, Shalinee; Speth, Robert C; Macheroux, Peter",Medical hypotheses,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110038; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32758880/,156

Although caregiver investment is associated with personal and relational benefits, there are also emotional, mental, relational, and physical costs. This study explores online well-being advice for nonprofessional caregivers of people with Alzheimer's and dementia, resulting in 332 online resources that offer informational support for nonprofessional caregivers. Although competent communication directly impacts the well-being of caregiving relationships, only 39 of these texts offered advice related to communication strategies. Thematic analysis of these 39 sources resulted in 1,024 discrete pieces of caregiver advice related to three overarching themes: Daily Routine, Care Recipient Well-Being, and Caregiver Self-Care. We examine the Caregiver Self-Care theme to understand informational support available to caregivers. These self-care advice themes reveal a need for intentional focus on the home health quality of nonprofessional caregivers about ways that communication impacts their everyday lives.","Jones, Olivia E; Parks, Elizabeth S",Home health care services quarterly,https://doi.org/10.1080/01621424.2021.1907266; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33794755/,156

61886,The host immune dynamics of pneumococcal colonization: implications for novel vaccine development.,2014,"INTRODUCTION Occult cancer is present in 4%-9% of patients with unprovoked venous thromboembolism (VTE). Screening for cancer may be considered in these patients, with the aim to diagnose cancers in an early, potentially curable stage. Information is needed about the risk of occult cancer, overall and in specific subgroups, additional risk factors and on the performance of different screening strategies. METHODS AND ANALYSIS MEDLINE, Embase and CENTRAL databases were searched from November 2007 to January 2016 for prospective studies that had evaluated protocol-mandated screening for cancer in patients with unprovoked VTE and with at least 12 months' follow-up. Two reviewers independently assessed articles for eligibility. Ten eligible studies were identified and individual patient data were obtained from each of them. Study quality was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool . Generalised linear mixed-effects models was used to calculate estimates in a one-stage meta-analytic approach, overall and in a number of subgroups, including patients undergoing limited screening only, elderly patients, patients with previous VTE, smokers and patients using oestrogens. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethical approval is not required for this systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis. Findings have been submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals and presentations at national and international conferences to provide clinicians and other decision-makers with valid and precise risk estimates of occult cancer, overall and in specific clinical subgroups, with risk factors for occult cancer, with estimates of the diagnostic performance of limited screening and with an exploration of the benefit of extensive screening strategies.","van Es, Nick; Le Gal, Grégoire; Otten, Hans-Martin; Robin, Philippe; Piccioli, Andrea; Lécumberri, Ramon; Jara-Palomares, Luis; Religa, Piotr; Rieu, Viriginie; Rondina, Matthew T; Beckers, Mariëlle M; Prandoni, Paolo; Salaun, Pierre-Yves; Nisio, Marcello Di; Bossuyt, Patrick M; Büller, Harry R; Carrier, Marc",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2016-015562; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28601834/,156
63808,An Acute Mouse Spinal Cord Slice Preparation for Studying Glial Activation ex vivo.,2017,"BACKGROUND In addition to the threat of serious illness, COVID-19 brought abrupt changes in lifestyle resulting in widespread fear among many Americans. This study examines the evolution of anxiety over the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic, testing for differential experiences among vulnerable populations. METHODS Phase 1 of the Census Bureau's Household Pulse Survey details the frequency of anxiety among a nationally representative sample of adults from April 23, 2020 through July 21, 2020. Negative binomial regression assessed differences in the frequency of anxiety among demographic, income, health and employment status cohorts. Propensity score matching to the 2019 National Health Interview Survey allowed previous anxiety and health status to be included in the model. RESULTS Anxiety frequency for 944,719 individuals was observed over three months. Whites, blacks and Hispanics showed increasing frequency of anxiety over the time period, particularly blacks. Prior to COVID-19, 13% of respondents reported regular or semiregular anxiety, compared to 25-35% during the pandemic. Regression analysis suggests that frequent anxiety was highly and positively correlated with COVID-19 case fatality rate and higher levels of frequency were observed among those with poor health, incomes below $25,000, and without paid employment. LIMITATIONS Causal inference was not able to be investigated due to the cross-sectional study design. CONCLUSIONS While blacks showed lower levels of anxiety initially, the proportion of the population experiencing regular anxiety increased nearly 20% over the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic. This rapid increase in anxiety could be due to inequity in health and economic outcomes among blacks.","Jacobs, Molly; Burch, Ashley E",Journal of affective disorders,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.05.027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34102549/,156
65589,Utility of feline coronavirus antibody tests.,2015,"High-energy radiation detectors such as X-ray detectors with low light photoresponse characteristics are used for several applications including, space, medical, and military devices. Here, an indirect bandgap inorganic perovskite-based X-ray detector is reported. The indirect bandgap nature of perovskite materials is revealed through optical characterizations, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL), and theoretical simulations, demonstrating that the differences in temperature-dependent carrier lifetime related to CsPbX3 (X = Br, I) perovskite composition are due to the changes in the bandgap structure. TRPL, theoretical analyses, and X-ray radiation measurements reveal that the high response of the UV/visible-blind yellow-phase CsPbI3 under high-energy X-ray exposure is attributed to the nature of the indirect bandgap structure of CsPbX3 . The yellow-phase CsPbI3 -based X-ray detector achieves a relatively high sensitivity of 83.6 μCGyair -1 cm-2 (under 1.7 mGyair s-1 at an electron field of 0.17 V μm-1 used for medical diagnostics) although the active layer is based solely on an ultrathin (≈6.6 μm) CsPbI3 nanocrystal film, exceeding the values obtained for commercial X-ray detectors, and further confirming good material quality. This CsPbX3 X-ray detector is sufficient for cost-effective device miniaturization based on a simple design.","Xin, Bin; Alaal, Naresh; Mitra, Somak; Subahi, Ahmad; Pak, Yusin; Almalawi, Dhaifallah; Alwadai, Norah; Lopatin, Sergei; Roqan, Iman S",Small,https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202004513; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33006244/,156

After the high impact of the pandemic, a wide clinical spectrum of late complications associated with COVID-19 are being observed. We report a case of a severe Clostridium difficile colitis in a post-treatment and recovered COVID-19 patient. A 64-year-woman with a one-month hospital admission for severe bilateral pneumonia associated with COVID-19 and 10 days after discharge presented with diarrhoea and abdominal pain. Severe C. difficile-associated colitis is diagnosed according to clinical features and CT findings. An urgent pancolectomy was performed due to her bad response to conservative treatment. Later evolution slowly improved to recovery. C. difficile-associated colitis is one of the most common hospital-acquired infections. Significant patient-related risk factors for C. difficile infection are antibiotic exposure, older age, and hospitalisation. Initial therapeutic recommendations in our country included administration broad-spectrum antibiotics to all patients with bilateral pneumonia associated with SARS-CoV-2. These antibiotics are strongly associated with C. difficile infection. Our patient developed a serious complication of C. difficile due to the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. The appearance of late digestive symptoms in patients diagnosed and treated for COVID-19 should alert clinicians to the possibility of C. difficile infection.

70092,Fear of Dementia in the General Population: Findings from the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP).,2020-05-06,"INTRODUCTION Smoking among persons with a mental health disorder is associated with inequitable health, social and economic burden. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are considered the gold standard design for the assessment of healthcare intervention efficacy/effectiveness. However, many RCTs of smoking interventions for persons with a mental health disorder lack rigour due to low participant retention. No systematic review has pooled retention rates in randomised trials of smoking interventions for persons with a mental health disorder or explored associated factors. The aims of the systematic review will therefore be to: (1) summarise overall rates of participant retention in smoking cessation and reduction trials involving persons with a mental health disorder (including for experimental and control groups separately) and (2) determine if retention rates vary according to participant, environmental, researcher and study factors. METHODS AND ANALYSIS PsycINFO, EMBASE, MEDLINE, CENTRAL and The Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Review Group Specialised Register will be searched for reports of RCTs of outpatient smoking cessation or reduction interventions for adults with a mental health disorder. The search terms will include MeSH terms and free text words, and there will be no language or date restrictions. All databases will be searched from inception to present. Data will be analysed using the Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model, and where substantial heterogeneity (I2 >50%) is detected, DerSimonian & Laird inverse-variance random effects model. Pooled estimates and 95% CIs will be calculated for overall participant retention rates and for intervention and control trial arms separately. Associations between participant retention and participant, environmental, researcher and study factors will be assessed via subgroup analyses and, where sufficient data are obtained, meta-regression. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION This study does not require ethical approval. The findings of this review will be disseminated via publication in a peer-reviewed open access medical journal and presentations at international scientific meetings.","Metse, Alexandra Patricia; Stockings, Emily; Bailey, Jacqueline; Regan, Timothy; Bartlem, Kate; Wolfenden, Luke; Taylor, Gemma; Wiggers, John; Bowman, Jenny",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2019-030646; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31488491/,156
70131,What biomedical education might learn from real estate tours.,2021-07-07,"Genomics analysis of a historically-intriguing and predicted emergent human adenovirus (HAdV) pathogen, which caused pneumonia and death, provides insight into a novel molecular evolution pathway involving ""ping-pong"" zoonosis and anthroponosis. The genome of this promiscuous pathogen is embedded with evidence of unprecedented multiple, multidirectional, stable, and reciprocal cross-species infections of hosts from three species (human, chimpanzee, and bonobo). This recombinant genome, typed as HAdV-B76, is identical to two recently reported simian AdV (SAdV) genomes isolated from chimpanzees and bonobos. Additionally, the presence of a critical adenoviral replication element found in HAdV genomes, in addition to genes that are highly similar with counterparts in other HAdVs, reinforce its potential as a human pathogen. Reservoirs in nonhuman hosts may explain periods of apparent absence and then re-emergence of human adenoviral pathogens, as well as present pathways for the genesis of those thought to be newly emergent. The nature of the HAdV-D76 genome has implications for the use of SAdVs as gene delivery vectors in human gene therapy and vaccines, selected to avoid preexisting and potentially fatal host immune responses to HAdV.Importance: An emergent adenoviral human pathogen, HAdV-B76, associated with a fatality in 1965, shows a remarkable degree of genome identity with two recently isolated simian adenoviruses that contain cross-species genome recombination events from three hosts: human, chimpanzee, and bonobo. Zoonosis (nonhuman to human transmission) and anthroponosis (human to nonhuman transmission) may play significant roles in the emergence of human adenoviral pathogens.","Dehghan, Shoaleh; Seto, Jason; Liu, Elizabeth B; Ismail, Ashrafali M; Madupu, Ramana; Heim, Albert; Jones, Morris S; Dyer, David W; Chodosh, James; Seto, Donald",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00564-19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31243128/,156

There has been considerable concern that adherence with DOACs may be poor compared with warfarin. Little is known about the patient experience of switching from warfarin to DOAC and how patients manage their DOAC long term. Our aim was to conduct focus groups exploring patient's previous experiences with warfarin, their current experience with DOACs, their adherence to DOACs and the long-term service provision they envisage. METHODS Patients enrolled on the Switching Study who had been switched from warfarin to a DOAC >1year previously were invited to participate in focus groups. Two focus groups for atrial fibrillation (AF) and two for secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) patients were held at anticoagulation clinics in South London, UK. Data was analysed using framework analysis to extract dominant themes. RESULTS Five VTE patients and 15 AF patients attended the focus groups. Dominant themes that emerged were: indication specific anticoagulation prioritisation, warfarin as a necessary inconvenience, DOACs as the anticoagulant of choice, concerns regarding DOAC monitoring, high adherence to DOACs and desire for long-term access to specialist anticoagulation services. DISCUSSION VTE patients prioritised anticoagulation over other therapies whereas AF patients did not. All participants reported high levels of adherence to DOACs. Patients derived confidence from long-term management in specialist anticoagulation clinics stating a preference to be managed in such a service.","Bartoli-Abdou, John K; Patel, Jignesh P; Crawshaw, Jacob; Vadher, Bipin; Brown, Alison; Roberts, Lara N; Patel, Raj K; Arya, Roopen; Auyeung, Vivian",Thrombosis research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.thromres.2017.12.021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29306122/,156

A lot of respiratory treatments for critically ill patients are deemed as high-risk factors for nosocomial transmission, such as intubation, manual ventilation by resuscitator, noninvasive ventilation, high-flow nasal cannula, bronchoscopy examination, suction and patient transportation, etc, due to its high possibility to cause or worsen the spread of the virus. As such, we developed this consensus recommendations on all those high-risk treatments, based on the current evidence as well as the resource limitation in some areas, with the aim to reduce the nosocomial transmission and optimize the treatment for the COVID-19 pneumonia patients. Those recommendations include: (1)Standard prevention and protection, and patient isolation; (2)Patient wearing mask during HFNC treatment; (3)Using dual limb ventilator with filters placed at the ventilator outlets, or using heat-moisture exchanger (HME) instead of heated humidification in single limb ventilator with HME placed between exhalation port and mask; avoid using mask with exhalation port on the mask; (4)Placing filter between resuscitator and mask or artificial airway; (5)For spontaneous breathing patients, placing mask for patients during bronchoscopy examination; for patients receiving noninvasive ventilation, using the special mask with bronchoscopy port to perform bronchoscopy; (6)Using sedation and paralytics during intubation, cuff pressure should be maintained between 25-30 cmH(2)O(1 cmH(2)O=0.098 kPa); (7)In-line suction catheter is recommended and it can be used for one week; (8)Dual-limb heated wire circuits are recommended and only changed with visible soiled; (9)For patients who need breathing support during transportation, placing an HME between ventilator and patient; (10)PSV is recommended for implementing spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), avoid using T-piece to do SBT. When tracheotomy patients are weaned from ventilator, HME should be used, avoid using T-piece or tracheostomy mask.

This study investigated the percentage of all S. aureus isolates that are resistant to methicillin and also MRSA susceptibility to other antimicrobial agents in the JR Sapporo Hospital inpatient service. The inpatient service MRSA percentages for Japan, Hokkaido, and JR Sapporo Hospital from 2010-2019 were compared, exploring the annual rate of change in the MRSA percentage. We also investigated the antimicrobial use density (AUD) and its relationship with MRSA antimicrobial susceptibility in the JR Sapporo Hospital during 2019. The MRSA percentage in JR Sapporo Hospital was 61.5% (95% CI [52.6-69.7]) in 2010 but was only 51.6% (95% CI [41.6-61.5]) in 2019, which is a 1.43% (95% CI [0.42-2.43]) annual decrease (p = 0.05).

73277,Pharmacokinetics of N-acetylcysteine after oral and intravenous administration to healthy cats.,2013,"As a group of disorders, autoimmunity ranks as the third most prevalent cause of morbidity and mortality in the Western World. However, the etiology of most autoimmune diseases remains unknown. Although genetic linkage studies support a critical underlying role for genetics, the geographic distribution of these disorders as well as the low concordance rates in monozygotic twins suggest that a combination of other factors including environmental ones are involved. Virus infection is a primary factor that has been implicated in the initiation of autoimmune disease. Infection triggers a robust and usually well-coordinated immune response that is critical for viral clearance. However, in some instances, immune regulatory mechanisms may falter, culminating in the breakdown of self-tolerance, resulting in immune-mediated attack directed against both viral and self-antigens. Traditionally, cross-reactive T-cell recognition, known as molecular mimicry, as well as bystander T-cell activation, culminating in epitope spreading, have been the predominant mechanisms elucidated through which infection may culminate in an T-cell-mediated autoimmune response. However, other hypotheses including virus-induced decoy of the immune system also warrant discussion in regard to their potential for triggering autoimmunity. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms by which virus infection and antiviral immunity contribute to the development of autoimmunity.","Getts, Daniel R; Chastain, Emily M L; Terry, Rachael L; Miller, Stephen D",Immunological reviews,https://doi.org/10.1111/imr.12091; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23947356/,156

Although several methods have been reported to date, none is considered consistently reliable. We developed a simple method for intracorporeal circular-stapled esophagojejunostomy using a modified over-and-over suture technique. The surgical outcomes of our technique were evaluated in comparison with those of open total gastrectomy (OTG). METHODS From April 2012 to August 2014, reconstruction using this method in LTG was performed for 21 consecutive patients with gastric cancer (LTG group). Their surgical outcomes were compared with those of 27 patients with gastric cancer who underwent OTG without splenectomy (OTG group) between January 2011 and April 2014. RESULTS Estimated blood loss was significantly lower, and the postoperative hospital stay was significantly shorter in the LTG group than in the OTG group. The operating time and the number of harvested lymph nodes were similar between the two groups. The incidence of overall complications did not differ significantly between the two groups. Anastomotic leakage developed in one of the 21 patients in the LTG group and in two of the 27 patients in the OTG group. Anastomotic stenosis was observed in one patient in the LTG group. CONCLUSIONS We consider this method as simple and feasible for most laparoscopic surgeons with basic laparoscopic suturing skills. This method might help LTG to become an accepted standard surgical option for treatment of patients with gastric cancer.","Matsuda, Takeru; Iwasaki, Takeshi; Mitsutsuji, Masaaki; Hirata, Kenro; Maekawa, Yoko; Tsugawa, Daisuke; Sugita, Yutaka; Shimada, Etsuji; Kakeji, Yoshihiro",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-015-4073-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25631108/,156

This is especially the case for the COVID-19 pandemic where public engagement can potentially save lives and flatten the curve. This paper considers how the use of interactive features and strategic network positions of health agencies on social media influenced their public engagement outcomes. Specifically, we analyzed 203 U.S. public health agencies' Twitter activity and the public engagement they received by extracting data from a large-scale Twitter dataset collected from January 21st to May 31st, 2020. Results show that health agencies' network position in addition to their two-way communication strategy greatly influenced the level of public engagement with their COVID-19 related content on Twitter. Findings highlight the benefits of strategic social media communication of public health agencies resides not only in how agencies use social media but also in their formation of network position to amplify their visibility. As official sources of health and risk information, public health agencies should coordinate their social media communication efforts to strategically position themselves in advantageous network positions to augment public engagement outcomes.","Kim, Hye Min; Saffer, Adam J; Liu, Wenlin; Sun, Jingyi; Li, Yiqi; Zhen, Lichen; Yang, Aimei",Health communication,https://doi.org/10.1080/10410236.2021.1886393; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33591839/,156

The risk factors associated with infection acquisition and mortality in transplant recipients using serological data has not been reported. METHODS From 1725 maintenance transplant recipients, 855 consecutive patients were screened for SARS-CoV2 antibodies. Serological screening utilized assays to detect both the N protein and Receptor binding domain antibodies. 33/855 (3.9%) of the screened patients had prior infection confirmed with RT-PCR. 21 additional patients from our 1725 maintenance cohort with RT-PCR confirmed infection were included in our analysis. RESULTS 89/855 (10.4%) patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. 59/89 (66.3%) cases were patients newly identified as exposed, whilst 30/89 (33.7%) seropositive patients had previous infection confirmed by RT-PCR.A diagnosis of SARS-CoV2 (RT-PCR or Ab+) was associated with being from a noncaucasoid background, p=0.015; having a diagnosis of diabetes, p=0.028 and a history of allograft rejection, p<0.01. Compared with the RT-PCR+ cohort, patients with serological proven infection alone, were more likely to be receiving tacrolimus monotherapy, p<0.01 and less likely to have a diagnosis of diabetes, p=0.012.17/113 (15.0%) of all patients with infection (RT-PCR and/or Ab+) died. Risk factors associated with survival were older age, OR:1.07 (1.00-1.13), p=0.041; receiving prednisolone, OR:5.98 (1.65-21.60), p<0.01 and the absence of diabetes, OR:0.27 (0.07-0.99), p=0.047. CONCLUSIONS This study identifies risk factors and outcome for COVID-19 infection incorporating data on serologically defined infection, and highlights the important contribution of immunosuppression regimen on outcomes.","Willicombe, Michelle; Gleeson, Sarah; Clarke, Candice; Dor, Frank; Prendecki, Maria; Lightstone, Liz; Lucisano, Gaetano; McAdoo, Stephen; Thomas, David",Transplantation,https://doi.org/10.1097/tp.0000000000003526; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33196625/,156
75742,Nitinol self-expanding stents vs. balloon angioplasty for very long femoropopliteal lesions.,2014,"BACKGROUND This study investigated the relationship between training programmes for pandemic flu and level of knowledge of health-care professionals with performance in an avian flu exercise. METHODS Training programmes of all general hospitals in Israel for managing a pandemic influenza were evaluated. Spearman's ρ correlation was used to analyse the relationship between training scores and level of knowledge of medical personnel with performance in an avian flu exercise. Hospital preparedness levels were evaluated at two time points and Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to determine if overall preparedness scores improved over time. RESULTS Evaluation of training programmes for pandemic influenza showed high to very high scores in most hospitals (mean 85, SD 22). Significant correlations between training and performance in the exercise were noted for: implementation of training programmes 0.91, P = 0.000; designating personnel for training 0.87, P = 0.000; content of training 0.61, P = 0.001; and training materials 0.36, P = 0.05. Overall reliability of the evaluation scores was 0.82 and reliability for two of the sub-scales was: implementation of the programme 0.78; and designating personnel for training 0.37. No significant correlation was found between level of knowledge and performance in the exercise. DISCUSSION Training programmes for hospital personnel for pandemic flu have a significant role in improving performance in case of pandemic flu. The key component of the training programme appears to be the implementation of the programme. Use of knowledge tests should be further investigated, as they do not appear to correlate with the level of emergency preparedness for pandemic influenza.","Adini, Bruria; Goldberg, Avishay; Cohen, Robert; Bar-Dayan, Yaron",European journal of public health,https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckr030; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21441557/,156

In particular, this study aims to examine (a) how the number of tweets varies as a function of the timeline of the pandemic and associated measures and (b) how the content of these tweets, including displayed emotions, changes. Therefore, 373,908 tweets and retweets from Belgium were collected from February 25, 2020 to the March 30. Time series analysis, network bigrams, topic models, and emotional lexica were deployed for analysis. The results showed that significant events related to the virus correlated with an immediate increase in the number of tweets addressing them. Furthermore, the Belgian Twitter discourse was characterized by positively connoted words, which also refer to European solidarity. These findings do not only stress the relevance of Twitter as a medium for public discourse during lockdowns, but also seem to indicate that the Belgian public supports policy measures that respect solidarity in Europe.","Kurten, Sebastian; Beullens, Kathleen","Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking",https://doi.org/10.1089/cyber.2020.0341; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32857607/,156

Objective To study the association between the daily wearing of eyeglasses and the susceptibility to COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants This cohort study enrolled all inpatients with COVID-19 in Suizhou Zengdu Hospital, Suizhou, China, a designated hospital for COVID-19 treatment in the area, from January 27 to March 13, 2020. COVID-19 was diagnosed according to the fifth edition of Chinese COVID-19 diagnostic guidelines. The proportion of persons with myopia who wore eyeglasses in Hubei province was based on data from a previous study. Exposures Daily wearing of eyeglasses for more than 8 hours. Main Outcomes and Measures The main outcomes were the proportions of daily wearers of eyeglasses among patients admitted to the hospital with COVID-19 and among the local population. Data on exposure history, clinical symptoms, underlying diseases, duration of wearing glasses, and myopia status and the proportion of people with myopia who wore eyeglasses in Hubei province were collected. People who wore glasses for more than 8 hours a day were defined as long-term wearers. Results A total of 276 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. Of these, 155 (56.2%) were male, and the median age was 51 (interquartile range, 41-58) years. All those who wore glasses for more than 8 hours a day had myopia and included 16 of 276 patients (5.8%; 95% CI, 3.04%-8.55%). The proportion of people with myopia in Hubei province, based on a previous study, was 31.5%, which was much higher than the proportion of patients with COVID-19 who had myopia in this sample. Conclusions and Relevance In this cohort study of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Suizhou, China, the proportion of inpatients with COVID-19 who wore glasses for extended daily periods (>8 h/d) was smaller than that in the general population, suggesting that daily wearers of eyeglasses may be less susceptible to COVID-19.","Zeng, Weibiao; Wang, Xiaolin; Li, Junyu; Yang, Yong; Qiu, Xingting; Song, Pinhong; Xu, Jianjun; Wei, Yiping",JAMA ophthalmology,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2020.3906; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32936214/,156
77269,African swine fever vaccine on the horizon.,2020-03-07,To explore early prevention and control of coronavirus disease 2019 （COVID-19） outbreak based on system dynamics model analysis. The data of early outbreak of COVID-19 were collected from the World Health Organization，covering countries of the China，United States，United Kingdom，Australia，Serbia and Italy. The susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered （SEIR） model was generalized and then its parameters were optimized. According to the parameters in the basic infection number expression，the sensitivity in the system dynamics model was used to quantitatively analyze the influence of the protection rate，infection rate and average quarantine time on the early spread of the outbreak. Based on the analysis results，targeted prevention and control measures for the early outbreak of COVID-19 were proposed. The generalized SEIR model had a good fit for the early prediction and evaluation of COVID-19 outbreaks in six countries. The spread of COVID-19 was mainly affected by the protection rate，infection rate and average quarantine time. The improvement of the protection rate in the first ays was the most important:the greater the protection rate，the fewer the number of confirmed cases. The infection rate in the first 5 days was the most critical:the smaller the infection rate，the fewer the number of confirmed cases. The average quarantine time in the first 5 days was very important:the shorter the average quarantine time，the fewer the number of confirmed cases. Through the comparison of key parameters of six countries，Australia and China had implemented strict epidemic prevention policies，which had resulted in good epidemic prevention effects. In the early stage of the outbreak，it is necessary to improve the protection rate，shorten the average quarantine time，and implement strict isolation policies to curb the spread of COVID-19.,"Gao, Chao; Dong, Shi; Wang, Jianwei; Pan, Xiaoxiong; Cui, Zhiwei",Zhejiang da xue xue bao.

This study aims to understand social media's effect on the general public's fear, degree of adopting precautionary behaviors, and compliance with health authorities' regulations during the pandemic. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in Jordan during the early period of COVID-19 pandemic. 827 individuals completed the questionnaire. Factors that had a significant association with increased fear included female gender (OR 2.6, 95% CI: 1.8-3.7), married status (OR 1.9, 95% CI: 1.2-3.4), following medical pages on social media (OR 1.6, 95% CI: 1.04, 2.42), and sharing of COVID-19 information on social media (OR 3.6, 95% CI: 1.8-7.1). The variables that were significantly associated with higher levels of precautionary behaviors were knowledge score (OR 1.2, 95% CI: 1.07-1.3), feeling of fear (OR 2.6, 95% CI: 1.71-3.), and following medical pages on social media (OR 2.8, 95% CI: 1.8-4.24). Regarding compliance with health officials' regulations, social media as a source of information and sharing information were significantly associated with lower odds of compliance with the Ministry of Health's regulations (OR 0.27, 95% CI: 0.13-0.5 and OR 0.46, 95% CI: 0.25-0.8, respectively). Social media is an essential platform for risk communication during pandemics. It plays a positive role in spreading knowledge and promotes certain preventive behaviors among the public. However, it may spread fear and encourage disruptive behaviors, which might be propagated by sharing the pandemic's news.","Yassin, Ahmed; AlOmari, Maryam; Al-Azzam, Sayer; Karasneh, Reema; Abu-Ismail, Luai; Soudah, Ola",International journal of environmental health research,https://doi.org/10.1080/09603123.2021.1935778; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34097535/,156
79819,Difficulties arising from the variety of testing schemes used for bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV).,2016,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, care for an adequate diet, well adapted to the body's needs and the current level of physical activity, becomes of particular importance. Many dietary compounds participate in the functioning of the immune system, while vitamins D, C, A (including beta-carotene), E, B6, B12, folic acid, zinc, copper, selenium, iron, amino acids, n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids and intestinal microbiota are crucial in various types of defence processes. There has been no evidence that consumed food and its compounds, including those with pro-/prebiotic properties, play a significant role in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection or alleviating its course. However, in terms of the nutritional value of food and the prevention of dysbiosis, recommending a varied diet with a high proportion of plant-based foods and an adequate amount of animal-based foods has a sound scientific basis. Malnutrition, underweight and obesity are considered independent and prognostic risk factors of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, which reduce a patient's chances of survival. Therefore, ensuring good nutritional status, including healthy body weight, is a reasonable approach in the prevention of viral infection SARS-CoV-2 or alleviating its course. The document is accompanied by two catalogues of practical nutritional recommendations during the COVID-19 pandemic, addressed to the general population and children.","Wądołowska, Lidia; Drywień, Małgorzata; Hamułka, Jadwiga; Socha, Piotr; Borawska, Maria; Friedrich, Mariola; Lange, Ewa; Human Nutrition Science Committee Of The Polish Academy Of Sciences, Members Of The",Roczniki Panstwowego Zakladu Higieny,https://doi.org/10.32394/rpzh.2021.0166; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34114781/,156
80029,Ecology and Evolution of Betacoronaviruses.,2021,"BACKGROUND SpO2 /FIO2 may be a reliable noninvasive alternative to the PaO2 /FIO2 index. Furthermore, the ROX index (ie, the ratio of SpO2 /FIO2 to breathing frequency) has been validated to predict high-flow nasal cannula failure in subjects under spontaneous breathing. However, these indices have not been tested in subjects with COVID-19 receiving invasive mechanical ventilation. This study aims to verify the correlation between both the ROX index and SpO2 /FIO2 with PaO2 /FIO2 and the ratio of PaO2 /FIO2 to breathing frequency, and to determine the accuracy of the indices that use SpO2 for the prediction of extubation failure in subjects with COVID-19. METHODS A prospective cohort study was conducted from May 15, 2020, to June 15, 2020, with subjects with COVID-19 on invasive mechanical ventilation. Indices using SpO2 in the formula were compared to those using PaO2 . Additionally, the performance of the indices in predicting extubation failure was evaluated. RESULTS This study included 69 subjects age 64.8 ± 14.6 y. There were no differences between the median values of the indices, including between the ROX index and PaO2 /FIO2 to breathing frequency (P = .40) or between PaO2 /FIO2 and SpO2 /FIO2 (P = .83). When comparing the ROX index with the PaO2 /FIO2 index to breathing frequency, they were found to be strongly correlated (R2 = 0.75 [95% CI 0.6763-0.8152], P < .001). The comparison of PaO2 /FIO2 with SpO2 /FIO2 revealed R2 = 0.70 (95% CI 0.563-0.749, P < .001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the ROX index to determine extubation failure was 0.74 (P = .01), whereas for SpO2 /FIO2 it was 0.78 (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS The indices presented a good correlation in subjects with COVID-19 on invasive mechanical ventilation, and both the ROX index and SpO2 /FIO2 can discriminate extubation failure in this population.","de Andrade Filho, Pedro H; de Assis Brasil, Eduardo S; Costa, Ladyer G; M Sousa, Daniel Escóssia; Pereira, Talison S; Silva, João Manoel",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.08564; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34006593/,156

A heat procedure has been suggested for specimen inactivation. This study was designed to evaluate the effect of serum heating on biochemical indexes, and providing a basis for accurate detection results of the COVID-19 patients. METHODS We collected 29 normal cases of two tubes of 5 mL whole blood. One tube was analyzed directly, and the other was analyzed after heating at 56°C 30 minutes. RESULTS A total of 34 serum biochemical index quantitative results were obtained, 28/34 indexes were not significantly affected by the heat inactivation and remained clinically interpretable. As the thermal inactivation for these indexes showed good correlation, ALB (p = 0.04, Pearson R = 0.91, 2.6% mean increase), CysC (p = 0.03, Pearson R = 0.98, 9.9% mean increase), CO2CP (p < 0.001, Pearson R = 0.96, 13% mean decrease), they were still inter-pretable. Four biochemical indexes ALP, CK, CK-MB, and insulin were inactivated and showed significant statistical differences (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Our study showed CK, CK-MB, ALP, and insulin were sensitive to heat and will be inhibited or degrade after heating, indicating that the rapid decrease of this indexes in the COVID-19 patients may be caused by sample heat inactivation. For safety and diagnostic accuracy, we recommend the use of a point-of-care device for blood gases, electrolytes, troponin, and liver and renal function tests within a ISL 2 or above biosafety cabinet with level 3 or above biosafety laboratory practice.","Zhao, Jia; Li, Fei; Yuan, Bo; Li, Weixin; Gao, Jian; Hu, Xiaopeng; An, Yawen; Liu, Zhiyong; Li, Zhiwen; Liu, Hanqing; Song, Shuo; Wang, Jianchun",Clinical laboratory,https://doi.org/10.7754/clin.lab.2020.200743; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33616334/,156
81474,Effect of cat litters on feline coronavirus infection of cell culture and cats.,2019,"BACKGROUND The interplay between nasopharyngeal bacterial carriage, viral coinfection, and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) is poorly understood. We explored this association in Vietnamese children aged less than 5 years. METHODS A hospital-based case-control study of pediatric LRTIs was conducted in Nha Trang, Vietnam. A total of 550 hospitalized children (274 radiologically confirmed pneumonia [RCP] and 276 other LRTIs) were enrolled and 350 healthy controls were randomly selected from the community. Polymerase chain reaction-based methods were used to measure bacterial loads of Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP), Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis and to detect 13 respiratory viruses and bacterial serotypes in nasopharyngeal samples of study participants. RESULTS The median nasopharyngeal bacterial load of SP was substantially higher in children with RCP compared with healthy controls or children with other LRTIs (P < 0.001). SP load was 15-fold higher in pneumonia children with viral coinfection compared with those children without viral coinfection (1.4 x 10⁷/mL vs. 9.1 x 10⁵/mL; P 0.0001). SP load was over 200-fold higher in serotypeable SP compared with nontypeable SP (2.5 x 10⁶/mL vs. 1 x 10⁴/mL; P < 0.0001). These associations were independent of potential confounders in multiple regression models. No clear association was found between nasopharyngeal load of Haemophilus influenzae or Moraxella catarrhalis and viral coinfection in either RCP or other LRTIs groups. CONCLUSIONS An increased load of SP in the nasopharynx was associated with RCP, viral coinfection, and presence of pneumococcal capsule.","Vu, Huong Thi Thu; Yoshida, Lay Myint; Suzuki, Motoi; Nguyen, Hien Anh Thi; Nguyen, Cat Dinh Lien; Nguyen, Ai Thi Thuy; Oishi, Kengo; Yamamoto, Takeshi; Watanabe, Kiwao; Vu, Thiem Dinh",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0b013e3181f111a2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20686433/,156
81755,Comparison of cross-sectional anatomy and computed tomography of the tarsus in horses.,2011,"BACKGROUND A three-dimensionally favourable mandibular bone crest is desirable to be able to successfully implant placement to meet the aesthetic and functional criteria in the implant-prosthetic rehabilitation. Several surgical procedures have been advocated for bone augmentation of the atrophic mandible, and the sandwich osteotomy is one of these techniques. The aim of the present case report was to assess the suitability of segmental mandibular sandwich osteotomy combined with a tunnel technique of soft tissue. Based on our knowledge, nobody described before the sandwich osteotomy with tunnel technique to improve the healing of the wound and meet the dimensional requirements of preimplant bone augmentation in cases of a severely atrophic mandible. CASE PRESENTATION A 59-year-old woman with a severely atrophied right mandible was treated with the sandwich osteotomy technique filled with autologous bone graft harvested by a cortical bone collector from the ramus. Clinical examination revealed that the mandible was edentulous bilaterally from the first molar to the second molar region. Radiographically, atrophy of the mandibular alveolar ridge in the same teeth site was observed. We began to treat the right side. A horizontal osteotomy of the edentulous mandibular bone was then made with a piezoelectric device after tunnel technique of the soft tissue. The segmental mandibular sandwich osteotomy (SMSO) was finished by two (mesial and distal) slightly divergent vertical osteotomies. The entire bone fragment was displaced cranially, and the desirable position was obtained. The gap was filled completely with autologous bone chips harvested from the mandibular ramus through a cortical bone collector. No barrier membranes were used to protect the grafts. The vertical incisions were closing with interruptive suturing of the flaps with a resorbable material. In this way, the suture will not fall on the osteotomy line of the jaw; the result will be a better predictability of soft and hard tissue healing. CONCLUSIONS Segmental mandibular sandwich osteotomy is an easy and safety technique that could be performed in an atrophic posterior mandible. Future studies involving long-term follow-up are needed to evaluate the permanence of these results.","Santagata, Mario; Sgaramella, Nicola; Ferrieri, Ivo; Corvo, Giovanni; Tartaro, Gianpaolo; D'Amato, Salvatore",International journal of implant dentistry,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40729-017-0077-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28459123/,156

To overcome the kinetic variations of two individual imaging agents through the lymphatic system, we report herein on two multifunctional macromolecules, 5a and 6a, that contain a radionuclide ((99m)Tc or (68)Ga) and a near-infrared (NIR) reporter for pre- and/or intraoperative SLN mapping by nuclear and NIR optical imaging techniques. Both bimodal probes are dextran-based polymers (10 kDa) functionalized with pyrazole-diamine (Pz) or 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) chelating units for labeling with fac-[(99m)Tc(CO)3](+) or (68)Ga(III), respectively, mannose units for receptor targeting, and NIR fluorophore units for optical imaging. The probes allowed a clear visualization of the popliteal node by single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT/CT) or positron emission tomography (PET/CT), as well as real-time optically guided excision. Biodistribution studies confirmed that both macromolecules present a significant accumulation in the popliteal node (5a: 3.87 ± 0.63% IA/organ; 6a: 1.04 ± 0.26% IA/organ), with minimal spread to other organs. The multifunctional nanoplatforms display a popliteal extraction efficiency >90%, highlighting their potential to be further explored as dual imaging agents.","Morais, Maurício; Campello, Maria P C; Xavier, Catarina; Heemskerk, Johannes; Correia, João D G; Lahoutte, Tony; Caveliers, Vicky; Hernot, Sophie; Santos, Isabel",Bioconjugate chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/bc500336a; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25265437/,156

Patient characteristics, RR practices, and hospital context and/or mechanism influence post-RR outcomes. We aim to describe and compare RR function and outcomes within our institution's multiple sites. METHODS We conducted a 3-year retrospective study to compare RR use, clinical characteristics, and outcomes between our hospital's central campus (CC) and 2 satellite campuses (SCs). RR training and procedures are uniform across all campuses. RESULTS Among the 2935 RRs reviewed, 1816 occurred during index admissions at the CC and 405 occurred at SCs. CC, when compared with SCs, had higher age at RR (3.2 years vs 1.4 years), prevalence of complex chronic conditions (62.4% vs 34.4%), surgical complications (20.2% vs 5%), severity of illness, and risk of mortality (P < .001). CC had higher daytime RR activations, longer time from admission to RR, and more activations by nurses (P < .001). Respiratory diagnoses were most prevalent uniformly, but cardiac, neurologic, and hematologic diagnoses were higher at CC (P < .001). Cardiac and/or respiratory arrests during RR and transfers to the ICU were similar. Cardiorespiratory interventions post-RR, hospital length of stay, and mortality were higher and ICU stay was shorter (P < .01) in the CC. Outcomes were mainly affected by patient characteristics and not RR factors on multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS Patient illness severity, RR characteristics, and outcomes are significantly different in our multisite locations. Outcomes are predominantly affected by patient severity and not RR characteristics. Standardized RR training and procedures likely balance the effect of varying RR characteristics on eventual outcomes.","Bavare, Aarti C; Bracken, Julie A; Guffey, Danielle; Graf, Jeanine M; Thomas, Jenilea K",Hospital pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1542/hpeds.2019-0280; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32601053/,156

CTX-M-producing GNB are resistant to most β-lactam antibiotics and are frequently multidrug-resistant, which limits treatment options. Rapid diagnostic tests that can detect ESBL-producing GNB, particularly CTX-M producers, in the urine of patients with UTIs are needed. Results from such a test could direct the selection of appropriate antimicrobial therapy at the point-of-care (POC). In this study, we show that a chromogenic, dual enzyme-mediated amplification system (termed DETECT [dual-enzyme trigger-enabled cascade technology]) can identify CTX-M-producing GNB from unprocessed urine samples in 30 minutes. We first tested DETECT against a diverse set of recombinant β-lactamases and β-lactamase-producing clinical isolates to elucidate its selectivity. We then tested DETECT with 472 prospectively collected clinical urine samples submitted for urine culture to a hospital clinical microbiology laboratory. Of these, 118 (25%) were consistent with UTI, 13 (11%) of which contained ESBL-producing GNB. We compared DETECT results in urine against a standard phenotypic method to detect ESBLs, and polymerase chain reaction and sequencing for CTX-M genes. DETECT demonstrated 90.9% sensitivity and 97.6% specificity (AUC, 0.937; 95% confidence interval, 0.822-1.000), correctly identifying 10 of 11 urine samples containing a clinically significant concentration of CTX-M-producing GNB (including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis). Our results demonstrate the clinical potential of DETECT to deliver diagnostic information at the POC, which could improve initial antibiotic selection.","Tarlton, Nicole J; Petrovic, Danka-Florence; Frazee, Bradley W; Borges, Clarissa A; Pham, Emily M; Milton, Aubrianne K; Jackson, Nicole; deBoer, Tara R; Murthy, Niren; Riley, Lee W",Microbial drug resistance,https://doi.org/10.1089/mdr.2020.0128; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830997/,156

Hence, we studied the impact of antibiotic pretreatment with amoxicillin, fosfomycin, and metronidazole (AFM therapy) and FMT versus AFM alone. METHODS AFM therapy was administered to patients for 2 weeks until 2 days before FMT. Patients' spouses or relatives were selected as donor candidates. Donor fecal samples were collected on the day of administration and transferred into the patient's colon by colonoscopy within 6 hours. Microbiome analysis was performed by 16S rRNA next-generation sequencing. RESULTS Patients with mild-to-severe active UC (combination-therapy group, n = 21; AFM monotherapy group, n = 20) were included. Thirty-six patients completed this assessment (combination-therapy group, n = 17; AFM monotherapy group, n = 19). A higher clinical response was observed after combination therapy compared with AFM monotherapy at 4 weeks after treatment. After the 2-week AFM therapy, the Bacteroidetes composition was nearly abolished. The Bacteroidetes proportion recovered in clinical responders at 4 weeks after FMT was not observed in the AFM monotherapy group. Persistent antimicrobial-associated dysbiosis found in the AFM monotherapy group was reversed by FMT. The recovery rate of Bacteroidetes at 4 weeks after FMT correlated with endoscopic severity. CONCLUSIONS FMT following antimicrobial bowel cleansing synergistically contributes to the recovery of the Bacteroidetes composition, which is associated with clinical response and UC severity. Thus, this therapeutic protocol may be useful for managing UC.","Ishikawa, Dai; Sasaki, Takashi; Osada, Taro; Kuwahara-Arai, Kyoko; Haga, Keiichi; Shibuya, Tomoyoshi; Hiramatsu, Keiichi; Watanabe, Sumio",Inflammatory bowel diseases,https://doi.org/10.1097/mib.0000000000000975; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27893543/,156

87074,Emergence of severe porcine epidemic diarrhoea in pigs in the USA.,2013,"Site-specific gene addition can allow stable transgene expression for gene therapy. When possible, this is preferred over the use of promiscuously integrating vectors, which are sometimes associated with clonal expansion and oncogenesis. Site-specific endonucleases that can induce high rates of targeted genome editing are finding increasing applications in biological discovery and gene therapy. However, two safety concerns persist: endonuclease-associated adverse effects, both on-target and off-target; and oncogene activation caused by promoter integration, even without nucleases. Here we perform recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV)-mediated promoterless gene targeting without nucleases and demonstrate amelioration of the bleeding diathesis in haemophilia B mice. In particular, we target a promoterless human coagulation factor IX (F9) gene to the liver-expressed mouse albumin (Alb) locus. F9 is targeted, along with a preceding 2A-peptide coding sequence, to be integrated just upstream to the Alb stop codon. While F9 is fused to Alb at the DNA and RNA levels, two separate proteins are synthesized by way of ribosomal skipping. Thus, F9 expression is linked to robust hepatic albumin expression without disrupting it. We injected an AAV8-F9 vector into neonatal and adult mice and achieved on-target integration into ∼0.5% of the albumin alleles in hepatocytes. We established that F9 was produced only from on-target integration, and ribosomal skipping was highly efficient. Stable F9 plasma levels at 7-20% of normal were obtained, and treated F9-deficient mice had normal coagulation times. In conclusion, transgene integration as a 2A-fusion to a highly expressed endogenous gene may obviate the requirement for nucleases and/or vector-borne promoters. This method may allow for safe and efficacious gene targeting in both infants and adults by greatly diminishing off-target effects while still providing therapeutic levels of expression from integration.","Barzel, A; Paulk, N K; Shi, Y; Huang, Y; Chu, K; Zhang, F; Valdmanis, P N; Spector, L P; Porteus, M H; Gaensler, K M; Kay, M A",Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/nature13864; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25363772/,156

BACKGROUND Little is known on the mechanical strength of tissue adhesives directly after application. Furthermore, rheological profiling may be important in understanding mechanical performance and explaining differences between adhesives. This study provides new data on the mechanical strength and rheology of a comprehensive list of tissue adhesives with regard to colorectal adhesiveness. METHODS Twelve surgical tissue adhesives were included: 4 cyanoacrylate adhesives (CA), 2 fibrin glues (FG), 3 polyethylene glycol (PEG) adhesives, and 3 albumin-based (AB) adhesives. Tubular rat colonic segments were glued together. Tensile (T), shear (S), and peel (P) strength were measured. Shear storage (G') and shear loss (G″) moduli were also evaluated. RESULTS CA adhesives were stronger than AB (T: P = 0.017; S: P = 0.064; P: P < 0.001), which, in turn, were stronger than PEG (T: P < 0.001; S: P < 0.001; P: P = 0.018). PEG were stronger than FG for shear (P = 0.013) and comparable for tensile and peel strength (P > 0.05). Within-group variation was smallest for CA. Mechanical strength correlated strongly between performed tests. Rheological properties (G' and G″) correlated strongly with mechanical strength for all adhesives combined. CONCLUSIONS CA adhesives are the strongest and most homogenous group in terms of mechanical strength. Hydrogels (FG, AB) are heterogeneous, with lower mechanical strength than CA. FG are mechanically the weakest adhesives. Rheological profiles correlate to mechanical strength and may be useful for predicting mechanical performance.","Vakalopoulos, Konstantinos Aristotelis; Wu, Zhouqiao; Kroese, Leonard; Kleinrensink, Gert-Jan; Jeekel, Johannes; Vendamme, Richard; Dodou, Dimitra; Lange, Johan Frederik",Annals of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0000000000000599; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24670843/,156
89466,Commentary: Advances in noninvasive perispinal oximetry.,2011,"Pharmacy technicians are exposed to volatile organic compounds, like the disinfectant isopropyl alcohol (IPA), during the process of aseptic compounding of parenteral cytotoxic drugs. The occupational exposure to nebulized IPA during aseptic compounding has not been investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate the exposure to IPA during aseptic compounding of parenteral cytotoxic drugs and to assess compliance with legal and regulatory limits. As a secondary endpoint, the difference between two disinfection methods was compared regarding the exposure to IPA. The exposure to IPA was measured during five working shifts of 8 hr and one shift of 4 hr. The concentration IPA was measured by using a six-gas monitor. Total daily exposure was calculated as 8-hr Time Weighted Average (TWA) air concentration in mg/m3 and compared with an Occupational Exposure Limit (OEL) value of 500 mg/m3 and incidental peak exposure of 5,000 mg/m3. To assess whether the 8-hr TWA air concentration meets the legal and regulatory limits the Similar Exposure Groups (SEG) compliance test was used. A paired sample t-test was conducted to assess difference in exposure between two disinfection methods. The average 8-hr TWA exposure to IPA during the six measurements varied from 2.6 mg/m3 to 43.9 mg/m3 and the highest momentary concentration measured was 860 mg/m3. The result of the SEG compliance test was 3.392 (Ur value) and was greater than the Ut value of 2.187 which means the exposure to IPA is in compliance with the OEL value. No significant difference in exposure was shown between two disinfection methods (p = 0.49). In conclusion, exposure to IPA during aseptic compounding of parenteral cytotoxic drugs showed compliance to the OEL values with no significant difference in exposure between two disinfection methods.","van den Berg, Roland B; de Poot, Stan; Swart, Eleonora L; Crul, Mirjam",Journal of occupational and environmental hygiene,https://doi.org/10.1080/15459624.2021.1933505; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34185621/,156

METHODS All FBOs providing palliative care in India were invited to complete an online questionnaire. Descriptive analysis was undertaken. RESULTS Response rate was 46/64 (72%); 44 provided palliative care; 30/44 (68%) were in rural or semiurban areas with 10-2700 beds. Fifty-two per cent (23/44) had dedicated palliative care teams and 30/44 (68%) provided it as part of general services; 17/44 (39%) provided both. 29/44 (66%) provided palliative care for cancer patients; 17/44 (34%) reported that this was more than half their workload.The pandemic led to reduced clinical work: hospital 36/44 (82%) and community 40/44 (91%); with reduction in hospital income for 41/44 (93%). 18/44 (44%) were designated government COVID-19 centres; 11/40 (32%) had admitted between 1 and 2230 COVID-19 patients.COVID-19 brought challenges: 14/44 (32%) lacked personal protective equipment; 21/44 (48%) had reduced hospital supplies and 19/44 (43%) lacked key medications including morphine. 29/44 (66%) reported reduction in palliative care work; 7/44 (16%) had stopped altogether. Twenty-three per cent (10/44) reported redeployment of palliative care teams to other work.

The objective was to verify the factors associated with sarcopenia in institutionalized elderly. METHODS In total, 219 elderly individuals (≥60 years old) living in long-term institutions in Natal/RN were included in the study. After defining the elderly as sarcopenic or non-sarcopenic, anthropometric, biochemical, sociodemographic and health-related were analyzed. The Student t-test and Mann-Whitney test were used to analyze the quantitative, while the chi-square test was used for the qualitative variables. Finally, Poisson regression was used to provide prevalence ratios for those variables that presented differences in the bivariate analyses. RESULTS Physical capacity and anthropometry were associated with sarcopenia. For each 1 cm of knee height, the elderly presented 2.71% more chance of not having sarcopenia, and eutrophic or overweight individuals (according to BMI) presented 37.71 and 91.81% chances, respectively, of not presenting sarcopenia. Elderly individuals who ambulate have a 30.08% chance of not being considered sarcopenic. In addition, biochemical and anthropometric indicators demonstrated a relationship of sarcopenia with malnutrition. CONCLUSION Sarcopenia is associated with a loss of body mass, not only selective muscle mass, and greater physical inability to ambulate.","de Oliveira Neto, Leônidas; de Oliveira, Larissa Praça; Agrícola, Pedro Moraes Dutra; de Oliveira Tavares, Vagner Deuel; Gomes, Igor Conterato; Sales, Márcia Cristina; Lima, Kenio Costa",Journal of public health,https://doi.org/10.1093/pubmed/fdaa122; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830271/,156

However, these instruments can cause thermal injuries, which can result in neural damage and necrosis. The objectives of this study were to establish a reproducible in vitro model for standardized assessment of electrosurgical devices and to evaluate whether optimized placement of surgical instruments can reduce the thermal spread. METHODS We evaluated thermal spread of two VSDs in vitro using thin bovine muscle strips. Thermal injury was measured using an infrared camera, temperature probes and histology. The recordings were made with the VSD alone and with a rectangular clamp next to the VSD. RESULTS Both instruments showed a significant temperature spread of 2.5 mm lateral to the VSD. The placement of a metal clamp next to the VSD significantly reduced the temperature spread. Histological examinations were able to underline these findings. CONCLUSIONS In this study we describe a straightforward clinically relevant in vitro model for the evaluation of future electrosurgical instruments. We demonstrated that the thermal spread of VSD could be further reduced by optimized placement of an additional surgical instrument. Our results could help surgeons protect sensitive structures like nerves in the vicinity of the VSD.","Eberli, Daniel; Hefermehl, Lukas J; Müller, Alexander; Sulser, Tullio; Knönagel, Hartmut",Urologia internationalis,https://doi.org/10.1159/000324253; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21525721/,156

COS are determined by consensus amongst key stakeholders, including health professionals, policymakers and patients, ensuring that the priorities and expertise of these representatives inform the choice of the most important outcomes to measure for a given condition. There is increased recognition of the need to integrate COS across the healthcare system and with existing regulatory apparatus, to ensure that outcomes being recorded are those of key relevance to important stakeholders. The aim of this study is to assess the degree of concordance between outcomes recommended in COS for research and in guidance provided by two key regulators: US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Methods: COS for research published during 2015-2019 with patient involvement and covering drug or device interventions will be compared against relevant regulatory guidelines, matched by condition. Guidance documents matching in scope (relating to intervention and population) to a COS for research will be scrutinised to identify all suggested outcomes for comparison against the core outcomes in the corresponding COS. Discussion: This study will identify variation between outcomes suggested in FDA and EMA regulatory guidance relative to outcomes included in published COS for research, thus demonstrating the degree of representation of COS in regulatory guidance and vice versa. We will share the study findings (in particular, highlighting any lack of concordance between COS and regulatory guidance overall or for particular disease areas) and will invite feedback from FDA and EMA; we will seek to highlight where findings support the recommendations towards using well-developed COS or will make recommendations to COS developers on outcomes of importance to these key regulators.","Dodd, Susanna; Fish, Rebecca; Gorst, Sarah; Hall, Deborah; Jacobsen, Pamela; Kirkham, Jamie; Main, Barry; Matvienko-Sikar, Karen; Saldanha, Ian J; Trépel, Dominic; Williamson, Paula R",HRB open research,https://doi.org/10.12688/hrbopenres.13139.2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34368618/,156

The presence of respiratory viruses was also determined. RESULTS Our study found a stable microbiome composition in the post-stabilization sputum samples of COPD patients, and 4 additional microbiomes in samples taken during the exacerbation, 3 of which showed a marked dysbiosis by Haemophilus, Pseudomonas, and Serratia. The fourth exacerbation microbiome had a very similar composition to post-stabilization samples, but some pathogens such as Moraxella and respiratory viruses were also found.

97821,Letter from the editor.,2021-03-04,"Chromate, Cr(VI), contamination in soil and groundwater poses serious threat to living organisms and environmental health worldwide. Sulphate green rust (GRSO4), a naturally occurring mixed-valent iron layered double hydroxide has shown to be highly effective in the reduction of Cr(VI) to poorly soluble Cr(III), giving promise for its use as reactant for in situ remedial applications. However, little is known about its immobilization efficiency inside porous geological media, such as soils and sediments, where this reactant would ultimately be applied. In this study, we tested the removal of Cr(VI) by GRSO4 in quartz sand fixed-bed column systems (diameter × length = 1.4 cm × 11 cm), under anoxic conditions. Cr(VI) removal efficiency (relative to the available reducing equivalents in the added GRSO4) was determined by evaluating breakthrough curves performed at different inlet Cr(VI) concentrations (0.125-1 mM) which are representative of Cr(VI) concentrations found at contaminated sites, different flow rates (0.25-3 ml/min) and solution pH (4.5, 7 and 9.5). Results showed that (i) increasing Cr(VI) inlet concentration substantially decreased Cr(VI) removal efficiency of GRSO4, (ii) flow rates had a lower impact on removal efficiencies, although values tended to be lower at higher flow rates, and (iii) Cr(VI) removal was enhanced at acidic pH conditions compared to neutral and alkaline conditions. For comparison, Cr(VI) removal by sulphidized nanoscale zerovalent iron (S-nZVI) in identical column experiments was substantially lower, indicating that S-nZVI reactivity with Cr(VI) is much slower compared to GRSO4. Overall, GRSO4 performed reasonably well, even at the highest tested flow rate, showing its versatility and suitability for Cr(VI) remediation applications in high flow environments.","Digiacomo, Flavia; Tobler, Dominique J; Held, Thomas; Neumann, Thomas",Geochemical transactions,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12932-020-00073-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803495/,156

This effect was studied in light of decreasing tissue damage induced by I/R in the testis of rats using N-acetylcysteine (NAC) as an antiapoptotic reference. Compounds 6a-c were the most active antiapoptotic hybrids with significant measurements for malondialdehyde (MDA) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and the apoptotic biomarkers (testicular testosterone, TNFα, and caspase-3) in comparison to the reference. A preliminary mechanistic study was performed to improve the antiapoptotic activity through caspase-3 inhibition. A compound assigned as 6-methoxy-4-(4-(((2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinolin-4-yl)oxy)methyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-1-yl)quinolin-2(1H)-one (6c) was selected as a representative of the most active hybrids in comparison to NAC. Assay of cytochrome C for 6c revealed an attenuation of cytochrome C level about 3.54 fold, comparable to NAC (4.13 fold). In caspases-3,8,9 assays, 6c was found to exhibit more potency and selectivity toward caspase-3 than other caspases. The testicular histopathological investigation was carried out on all targeted compounds 6a-g, indicating a significant improvement in the spermatogenesis process for compounds 6a-c if compared to the reference relative to the control. Finally, molecular docking studies were done at the caspase-3 active site to suggest possible binding modes. Hence, it could conceivably be hypothesized that compounds 6a-c could be considered good lead candidate compounds as antiapoptotic agents.","El-Sheref, Essmat M; Aly, Ashraf A; Alshammari, Mohammed B; Brown, Alan B; Abdel-Hafez, Sara Mohamed Naguib; Abdelzaher, Walaa Yehia; Bräse, Stefan; Abdelhafez, ElShimaa M N",Molecules,https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules25215057; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33143331/,156
98782,Prevalence and diagnostic value of the ultrasonographic honeycomb appearance of the spleen in cats.,2019,"Heart failure (HF) remains the most common cause of death and disability, and a major economic burden, in industrialized nations. Physiological, pharmacological, and clinical studies have demonstrated that activation of the renin-angiotensin system is a key mediator of HF progression. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a homolog of ACE, is a monocarboxypeptidase that converts angiotensin II into angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7) which, by virtue of its actions on the Mas receptor, opposes the molecular and cellular effects of angiotensin II. ACE2 is widely expressed in cardiomyocytes, cardiofibroblasts, and coronary endothelial cells. Recent preclinical translational studies confirmed a critical counter-regulatory role of ACE2/Ang 1-7 axis on the activated renin-angiotensin system that results in HF with preserved ejection fraction. Although loss of ACE2 enhances susceptibility to HF, increasing ACE2 level prevents and reverses the HF phenotype. ACE2 and Ang 1-7 have emerged as a key protective pathway against HF with reduced and preserved ejection fraction. Recombinant human ACE2 has been tested in phase I and II clinical trials without adverse effects while lowering and increasing plasma angiotensin II and Ang 1-7 levels, respectively. This review discusses the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of ACE2 and the role of the ACE2/Ang 1-7 axis in cardiac physiology and in the pathophysiology of HF. The pharmacological and therapeutic potential of enhancing ACE2/Ang 1-7 action as a novel therapy for HF is highlighted.","Patel, Vaibhav B; Zhong, Jiu-Chang; Grant, Maria B; Oudit, Gavin Y",Circulation research,https://doi.org/10.1161/circresaha.116.307708; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27081112/,156
99468,Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics: news.,2021-08-03,"The numerous and varied roles of phosphorylated organic molecules in biochemistry suggest they may have been important to the origin of life. The prominence of phosphorylated molecules presents a conundrum given that phosphorylation is a thermodynamically unfavorable, endergonic process in water, and most natural sources of phosphate are poorly soluble. We recently demonstrated that a semi-aqueous solvent consisting of urea, ammonium formate, and water (UAFW) supports the dissolution of phosphate and the phosphorylation of nucleosides. However, the prebiotic feasibility and robustness of the UAFW system are unclear. Here, we study the UAFW system as a medium in which phosphate minerals are potentially solubilized. Specifically, we conduct a series of chemical experiments alongside thermodynamic models that simulate the formation of ammonium formate from the hydrolysis of hydrogen cyanide, and demonstrate the stability of formamide in such solvents (as an aqueous mixture). The dissolution of hydroxylapatite requires a liquid medium, and we investigate whether a UAFW system is solid or liquid over varied conditions, finding that this characteristic is controlled by the molar ratios of the three components. For liquid UAFW mixtures, we also find the solubility of phosphate is higher when the quantity of ammonium formate is greater than urea. We suggest the urea within the system can lower the activity of water, help create a stable and persistent solution, and may act as a condensing agent/catalyst to improve nucleoside phosphorylation yields.","Lago, Jennifer L; Burcar, Bradley T; Hud, Nicholas V; Febrian, Rio; Mehta, Christopher; Bracher, Paul J; Atlas, Zachary D; Pasek, Matthew A",Origins of life and evolution of the biosphere : the journal of the International Society for the Study of the Origin of Life,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11084-020-09595-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388697/,156

This background has laid the foundation for telemedicine to play a role in controlling the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Telemedicine has the potential to allow the facilitation of providing the necessary medical care to patients without exposing them to contact with other patients or the general population. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the utilization of telemedicine by the Lebanese physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This cross-sectional online study was conducted using LimeSurvey® through an e-mail-based questionnaire sent to physicians currently enrolled in both Beirut and Tripoli Lebanese Order of Physicians. Results: Four hundred one physicians completed the survey resulting in a response rate of 5.85%. Most of the respondents (N = 401, 75.8%) reported using telemedicine to provide health care services to patients without in-person visits during the pandemic. Among those using telemedicine (N = 304), around 40% reported that they started using it during COVID-19 pandemic. Discussion: Literature states that the average time of an in-person clinic consultation is more than 15 min. This implies that telemedicine can play a role in saving physicians' time; this conclusion is supported by other studies that consider telemedicine a time-saving method of providing health care services. Conclusions: Our study indicated that telemedicine is used by the majority of Lebanese physicians and that this use has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results showed that telemedicine does have a potential that can allow it to be integrated in the health care system and implemented on a national organized level.","Shaarani, Issam; Ghanem, Ali; Jounblat, Mohammad; Jounblat, Hadi; Mansour, Reem; Taleb, Rim",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2021.0090; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33999731/,156

A total of 288 male broilers (Ross 308) were randomly divided into 6 dietary groups (4 replicates and 12 birds/replicate) and supplemented as follows: (I) Normal control (NC) received only basal diet under normal condition. The rest of the animals were challenged with heat and assigned to the following groups: (II) Heat stress control (HSC) received only basal diet; (III) Standard treatment (ST) received basal diet + vit E (100 ppm); (IV-VI) Herbal treatments (HT) received basal diet + 250, 350, and 450 ppm CEO. Heat stress could significantly decrease the animals' performance and induce severe oxidative/nitrosative stress. The HT at the middle dose could significantly improve body weight, body weight gain, and feed intake compared to HSC; however, none of the treatments had a significant effect on feed conversion ratio after inducing heat stress. Moreover, both ST and HT with a trend towards concentration-dependent fashion significantly contributed to normalization of oxidative/nitrosative biomarkers.

Methods The NCDB was queried for patients diagnosed with glioblastoma between 2004 and 2014. Patient demographic variables included age at diagnosis, sex, race, ethnicity, Charlson-Deyo score, insurance status, and rural/urban/metropolitan location of zip code. Treatment variables included surgical treatment, extent of resection, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, type of radiation, and treatment facility type. Outcomes included 30-day readmission, 30- and 90-day mortality, and overall survival. Multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed to evaluate variables associated with race and overall survival. Results A total of 103 652 glioblastoma patients were identified. There was a difference in the proportion of patients for whom surgery was performed, as well as the proportion receiving radiation, when stratified by race (P < .001). Black non-Hispanics had the highest rates of unplanned readmission (7.6%) within 30 days (odds ratio [OR]: 1.39 compared to White non-Hispanics, P < .001).

PATIENTS All patients previously had experienced a stroke or transient ischemic attack. Lesion locations included a unilateral M1-segment lesion in five patients; and ipsilateral internal carotid artery (ICA)-T, M1 and A1 lesions with contralateral supraclinoid ICA stenosis in one patient. Mean M1 stenosis was 77.3 ± 14.3%. RESULTS Six patients had balloon angioplasty; in one, a Wingspan stent deployed successfully after angioplasty failed to relieve the stenosis. Mean post-treatment stenosis was 41.0 ± 33.0%. In one patient, vessel rupture occurring during angioplasty caused severe disability. Two patients were asymptomatic for 4 years and 6 months, respectively. One asymptomatic patient had severe restenosis re-treated with intracranial stenting. Two patients became symptomatic and had re-treatment at 1 and 2 months, respectively.

METHODS A total of 162 patients who underwent thoracoscopic anatomical lung resection for lung tumors were enrolled in this study. Alveolar air leaks were sealed with a combination of bioabsorbable mesh and fibrin glue. The chest tube was removed just after the removal of the tracheal tube in selected patients in whom complete pneumostasis was obtained. RESULTS Alveolar air leaks were identified in 112 (69%) of the 162 patients in an intraoperative water-seal test performed just after anatomical lung resection. The chest tube could be removed in the operating room in 102 (63%) of the 162 patients. There were no cases of 30-day postoperative mortality or in-hospital death. None of the 102 patients who did not undergo postoperative chest tube placement required redrainage for a subsequent air leak or subcutaneous emphysema. The mean length of postoperative hospitalization was shorter in patients who had not undergone postoperative chest tube placement than in those who had. The omission of chest tube placement was associated with a reduction in the visual analog scale for pain from postoperative day 0 until postoperative day 3, in comparison with patients who underwent chest tube placement. CONCLUSIONS The outcome of our validation cohort revealed that a no-drain policy is safe in selected patients undergoing thoracoscopic major lung resection and that it may contribute to an early recovery.","Murakami, Junichi; Ueda, Kazuhiro; Tanaka, Toshiki; Kobayashi, Taiga; Kunihiro, Yoshie; Hamano, Kimikazu",The Annals of thoracic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.athoracsur.2017.03.030; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28610883/,156

110159,COVID-19 and Its Impact on Tourism Industry.,2021,"Current treatments for cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) are largely unsuccessful due to late diagnosis at advanced stage, leading to high mortality rate. Consequently, improved therapeutic approaches are urgently needed. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy is a newly potential therapy that can recognize specific surface antigen without major histocompatibility complex (MHC) restriction. Mucin 1 (MUC1) is an attractive candidate antigen as it is highly expressed and associated with poor prognosis and survival in CCA. We, therefore, set forth to create the fourth-generation CAR (CAR4) construct containing anti-MUC1-single-chain variable fragment (scFv) and three co-stimulatory domains (CD28, CD137, and CD27) linked to CD3ζ and evaluate anti-MUC1-CAR4 T cells in CCA models. Compared to untransduced T cells, anti-MUC1-CAR4 T cells produced increased levels of TNF-α, IFN-γ and granzyme B when exposed to MUC1-expressing KKU-100 and KKU-213A CCA cells (all p < 0.05). Anti-MUC1-CAR4 T cells demonstrated specific killing activity against KKU-100 (45.88 ± 7.45%, p < 0.05) and KKU-213A cells (66.03 ± 3.14%, p < 0.001) at an effector to target ratio of 5:1, but demonstrated negligible cytolytic activity against immortal cholangiocytes. Furthermore, the anti-MUC1-CAR4 T cells could effectively disrupt KKU-213A spheroids.

However, factors such as vasopressor usage may impact Vigileo-FloTrac's reliability in tracking CO changes. We tested third-generation Vigileo-FloTrac system's ability to accurately measure the changes in CO induced by vasopressor administration and increased preload in comparison with esophageal Doppler measurements. METHODS In 33 anesthetized patients, CO was monitored simultaneously by the third-generation Vigileo-FloTrac and esophageal Doppler. Hemodynamic challenges included phenylephrine (to increase vasomotor tone), ephedrine (to increase myocardial contractility and heart rate), and whole-body tilting (to increase preload). Measurements were performed before and after each intervention. RESULTS Overall, 176 pairs of CO measurements were obtained. The difference between paired pulse contour and Doppler measurements of CO was 0.14 ± 2.13 L/min (mean ± SD), and the percentage error (2 SD of the difference divided by the mean CO of the reference method) was 66%. The trending ability of pulse contour versus Doppler was 23% (concordance, the percentage of the total number of data points that are in 1 of the 2 quadrants of agreement) after phenylephrine treatment, 69% (concordance) after ephedrine treatment, and 96% (concordance) after whole-body tilting. CONCLUSIONS The pulse contour method of measuring CO, as implemented in the third-generation Vigileo-FloTrac device, accurately tracks changes in CO when preload changes. However, the pulse contour method does not accurately track changes in CO induced with phenylephrine and ephedrine.","Meng, Lingzhong; Tran, Nam Phuong; Alexander, Brenton S; Laning, Kathleen; Chen, Guo; Kain, Zeev N; Cannesson, Maxime",Anesthesia and analgesia,https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0b013e31822649fb; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21821516/,156
111435,Biofilm-based implant infections in orthopaedics.,2015,"Since the discovery of circulating tumor cells in 1869, technological advances in studying circulating biomarkers from patients' blood have made the diagnosis of nonhematologic cancers less invasive. Technological advances in the detection and analysis of biomarkers provide new opportunities for the characterization of other disease types. When compared with traditional biopsies, liquid biopsy markers, such as exfoliated bladder cancer cells, circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA), and extracellular vesicles (EV), are considered more convenient than conventional biopsies. Liquid biopsy markers undoubtedly have the potential to influence disease management and treatment dynamics. Our main focuses of this review will be the cell-based, gene-based, and protein-based key liquid biopsy markers (including EV and cfDNA) in disease detection, and discuss the research progress of these biomarkers used in conjunction with liquid biopsy. First, we highlighted the key technologies that have been broadly adopted used in hematological diseases. Second, we introduced the latest technological developments for the specific detection of cardiovascular disease, leukemia, and coronavirus disease. Finally, we concluded with perspectives on these research areas, focusing on the role of microfluidic technology and artificial intelligence in point-of-care medical applications. We believe that the noninvasive capabilities of these technologies have great potential in the development of diagnostics and can influence treatment options, thereby advancing precision disease management.","Fu, Yatian; Zhang, Yiyuan; Khoo, Bee Luan",Medicinal research reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/med.21731; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32929726/,156

We used a cross-sectional study design to describe disparities in the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) test results by demographic characteristics and clinical roles among a cohort of health care workers employed by the largest Midwestern health care system in the United States. METHODS We collected 16 233 SARS-CoV-2 IgG serum samples from June 8 through July 10, 2020, from a convenience sample of Illinois- and Wisconsin-based adult health care workers. The research team, in collaboration with ACL Laboratories, used a SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. Study data included SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay results and demographic characteristics of workers (age, sex, race, ethnicity, clinical role, zip code). We generated crude and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) to describe disparities in seroprevalence distribution among demographic and social factors. RESULTS Of 16 233 IgG serum samples tested, 622 (3.8%) test results were positive for SARS-CoV-2. We found significant disparities in SARS-CoV-2 positivity by age, race, ethnicity, and clinical role. Participants aged 32-82 had lower adjusted ORs (aORs) of positive IgG than participants aged 18-31 (aOR range, 0.54-0.66). Odds of positivity were higher among Black (aOR = 3.86), Asian (aOR = 1.42), and mixed-race (aOR = 1.99) workers than among White workers; among Hispanic workers (aOR = 1.80) than among non-Hispanic workers; and among coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) clinical workers (aOR = 1.86) than among nonclinical workers.

METHODS A longitudinal analysis of 2,458 adults in the Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery (LABS) study was used. Baseline data were used to identify subgroups. The outcome was 3-year weight change after bariatric surgery. RESULTS We identified four classes (subtypes) of obesity, which could be characterized as diabetes with low rates of high-density lipoprotein (Class 1), disordered eating (Class 2), mixed (Class 3), and extreme obesity with early onset (Class 4). Approximately 98% of participants in Class 1 had diabetes compared with < 40% in the other classes. There were high rates of binge eating in Class 2, and more than 92% of those in this class reported eating when not hungry. Class 4 was characterized by a higher BMI at baseline. Adults in Class 4 lost an average of 25.0% (males) and 30.3% (females) of their baseline weight over 3 years. In contrast with participants in Class 1, those in Classes 2 and 3 had significantly larger 3-year weight losses than their peers in Class 4. CONCLUSIONS Obesity is a heterogeneous disease. Bariatric surgery may be most beneficial for adults with disordered eating.","Field, Alison E; Inge, Thomas H; Belle, Steven H; Johnson, Geoffrey S; Wahed, Abdus S; Pories, Walter J; Spaniolas, Konstantinos; Mitchell, James E; Pomp, Alfons; Dakin, Gregory F; Wolfe, Bruce; Courcoulas, Anita P",Obesity,https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.22287; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30421853/,156
114793,Clinical reasoning in feline vestibular syndrome: which presenting features are the most important?,2020-11-12,"In this current COVID-19 pandemic, the elderly (60 years and over) are more vulnerable populations to be infected and become victims. In a disaster cycle, the various parts are usually divided into three stages, consisting of the pre-impact stage, the trans-impact stage, and the post-impact stage. It is necessary to explain how to handle the COVID-19 disaster for the elderly at each step (explain the meaning of pre-case, case (pre-hospital and hospital), and post-case phases, respectively). This paper presents the handling of COVID-19 for elderly in pre-case, case, and post-case phases in six Asia-Pacific countries (Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, and Japan). The data and information come from COVID-19 official websites of each country, including information from World Health Organization (WHO), United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), mass media, and professional associations. The handling of COVID-19 in the pre-case phase has been done correctly for the elderly, especially in Indonesia, Japan, Thailand, and Singapore. In the case phase (pre-hospital and hospital), only Indonesia, Japan, and Thailand have followed special handling protocols for the elderly, particularly for those who have comorbidities and respiratory diseases. For the post-case phase, all countries have the same treatment protocol for all age groups, with none specific for the elderly.","Susilowati, Indri Hapsari; Nakatani, Hiroki; Nugraha, Susiana; Pengpid, Supa; Keawpan, Wonpen; Hasiholan, Bonardo Prayogo; Toai, Nguyen Phuong; Abdeali, Ameerali; Isahak, Marzuki; Kamso, Sudijanto",Global health & medicine,https://doi.org/10.35772/ghm.2020.01061; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33409414/,156

Studies suggest that up to 90% of healthcare staff encounter incivility at work with it being considered 'part of the job'. METHODS Qualitative, in-depth, semistructured interviews (n=14) undertaken between June and December 2019. Purposive sampling was used to identify front-line paramedics working for one NHS Ambulance Trust. Interviews lasted between 16 and 45 min, were audiorecorded, verbatim transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS Four themes were identified: paramedics reported a lack of respect displayed both verbally and non-verbally from other professional groups. The general public and interdisciplinary colleagues alike have unrealistic expectations of the role of a paramedic. In order to deal with incivility paramedics often reported taking the path of least resistance which impacts on ways of working and shapes subsequent clinical decision-making, potentially threatening best practice. Finally paramedics report using coping strategies to support well-being at work. They report that a single episode of incivility is easier to deal with but subsequent episodes compound the first. CONCLUSIONS This study highlights the effect incivility can have on operational paramedics. Incivility from the general public and other health professionals alike can have a cumulative effect impacting on well-being and clinical decision-making.","Credland, Nicola Jane; Whitfield, Clare",Emergency medicine journal : EMJ,https://doi.org/10.1136/emermed-2020-209961; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34039640/,156
117673,"Pleural invasion, epidermal growth factor receptor mutation and carcinoembryonic antigen level affect pleural lavage cytology-positive status in non-small-cell lung cancer.",2020-11-16,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) causes a porcine disease associated with swine epidemic diarrhea. Different antagonistic strategies have been identified, and the mechanism by which PEDV infection impairs the production of interferon (IFN) and delays the activation of the IFN response to escape host innate immunity has been determined, but the pathogenic mechanisms of PEDV infection remain enigmatic. Our preliminary results revealed that endogenous F-box and WD repeat domain-containing 7 (FBXW7), the substrate recognition component of the SCF-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, is downregulated in PEDV-infected Vero E6 cells, according to the results from an isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) analysis. Overexpression of FBXW7 in target cells makes them more resistant to PEDV infection, whereas ablation of FBXW7 expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA) significantly promotes PEDV infection. In addition, FBXW7 was verified as an innate antiviral factor capable of enhancing the expression of RIG-I and TBK1, and it was found to induce interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), which led to an elevated antiviral state of the host cells. Moreover, we revealed that PEDV nonstructural protein 2 (nsp2) interacts with FBXW7 and targets FBXW7 for degradation through the K48-linked ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Consistent with the results proven in vitro, FBXW7 reduction was also confirmed in different intestinal tissues from PEDV-infected specific-pathogen-free (SPF) pigs. Taken together, the data indicated that PEDV has evolved with a distinct antagonistic strategy to circumvent the host antiviral response by targeting the ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation of FBXW7. Our findings provide novel insights into PEDV infection and pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE To counteract the host antiviral defenses, most viruses, including coronaviruses, have evolved with diverse strategies to dampen host IFN-mediated antiviral response, wither by interfering with or evading specific host regulators at multiple steps of this response. In this study, a novel antagonistic strategy was revealed showing that PEDV infection could circumvent the host innate response by targeted degradation of endogenous FBXW7 in target cells, a process that was verified to be a positive modulator for the host innate immune system. Degradation of FBXW7 hampers host innate antiviral activation and facilitates PEDV replication. Our findings reveal a new mechanism exploited by PEDV to suppress the host antiviral response.","Li, Mingwei; Wu, Yang; Chen, Jianfei; Shi, Hongyan; Ji, Zhaoyanag; Zhang, Xin; Shi, Da; Liu, Jianbo; Tian, Jin; Wang, Xiaobo; Shi, Zhaorong; Zhang, Hongling; Zhang, Hao; Guo, Longjun; Feng, Li",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00889-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34495699/,156
118605,Slowly progressive lymphohistiocytic meningoencephalomyelitis in 21 adult cats presenting with peculiar neurological signs.,2012,"Objective The aim of this study was to demonstrate the efficacy of neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (NADT) on perioperative outcomes in patients who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP). Materials and Methods From January 2008 to July 2018, we collected retrospective data of patients with clinically localized prostate cancer who underwent RP to assess their perioperative and pathological outcomes. The data included age, body mass index (BMI), serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) level, clinical stage, neoadjuvant ADT usage, operative time, estimated blood loss (EBL), perioperative complications, blood transfusion rate, adjacent organ injury rate, length of hospital stay, pathological stage, Gleason score (GS) of the biopsy and pathological specimen, specimen weight (g), and margin status. Results Of the 718 RPs performed, 138 (19.22%) were NADT and 580 (80.78%) were non-NADT. Patients who underwent NADT had a significant benefit in operative time (185 vs 195 mins), EBL (300 vs 500 mL) and specimen weight. These benefits were more obvious in non-low risk prostate cancer with less operative time, EBL, blood transfusion rate, length of hospital stay and specimen weight. However, the margin status and adjacent organ injury rate were similar in the NADT and non-NADT groups. Conclusion NADT provides significantly better perioperative outcomes, especially in non-low risk prostate cancer, and has comparable pathological outcomes.","Sangkum, Premsant; Sirisopana, Kun; Jenjitranant, Pocharapong; Kijvikai, Kittinut; Pacharatakul, Suthep; Leenanupunth, Charoen; Kochakarn, Wachira; Kongchareonsombat, Wisoot",Research and reports in urology,https://doi.org/10.2147/rru.s312128; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34104636/,156

METHODS This open-label, uncontrolled, multicenter, prospective study was conducted in primary care centers (n = 281) and included opioid-naïve and opioid-experienced patients with either a pain score ≥4 (0 = no pain, 10 = pain as bad as you can imagine), or with unacceptable side effects while taking opioids. The patients were treated with morphine sulfate extendedrelease capsules for up to four months. Patient-rated pain intensity (worst, least, average) over the past 24 hours (0-10 scale), pain interference with seven activities of daily living (0 = no interference, 10 = completely interferes), and adverse events were recorded. RESULTS Of 1487 patients who filled at least one prescription, 561 (38%) completed the study. Patients were primarily white (87%) and female (57%); 92% had pain for more than one year; and 79% were opioid-experienced. Median age was 52 years. Decreases in mean (± standard deviation) average pain scores (baseline 6.2 ± 2.3) were -0.8 ± 2.2 at visit 2 (5-14 days later), and -1.6 ± 2.3 and -1.7 ± 2.2 at visits 3 and 4 (spaced 3-4 weeks apart), respectively, and -1.1 ± 2.4 at visit 5 (included patients withdrawn from the study who were no longer taking the study drug). A similar trend was observed for worst pain and least pain scores and for pain interference with activities. Fifty-one percent of the safety population patients and 81% in the completer population reported being satisfied or very satisfied with the study treatment. Most common adverse events were typical of opioids, ie, constipation (14%), nausea (11%), vomiting (5%), and somnolence (5%).

This study evaluates the levels of dietary energy intake and the energy contributions of macronutrients, major food sources, and various eating occasions and processed food among Chinese adults. METHODS The study examined a cross-sectional sample from CHNS and CNTCS 2015 that used three 24 h recalls and calculated energy intake and food sources based on the China Food Composition Table. After excluding extreme values, the analyses included 11,974 subjects aged 18-64. RESULTS The estimated energy intake was 2063.3 kcal/d (2243.8 kcal/d for males and 1902.4 kcal/d for females), and 39.1% of subjects met the gender-age-PA-based Estimated Energy Requirement. The proportion of energy from fats was 35.8% without significant age or gender differences. Adults of lower socioeconomic statuses, indicated by lower education levels and lower household incomes per capita, consumed lower percentages of energy from fats and higher percentages from carbohydrates. The study population as a whole reported an average energy density of 1.88 kcal/g and an energy contribution from restaurant foods of 1.8%. CONCLUSIONS The study reports a lower energy intake level than CHNS 2009. Adults living in southern China or urban areas, which are relatively developed regions, or with higher socioeconomic statuses consumed less energy from carbohydrates, moderate amounts from proteins, and more from fats, indicating a need for dietary guidelines or interventions that take into account socio-demographic factors.","Jiang, Hongru; Zhang, Ji; Du, Wenwen; Su, Chang; Zhang, Bing; Wang, Huijun",European journal of clinical nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41430-020-0698-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32724092/,156

121164,Reader Response: Prediction of Regaining Consciousness Despite an Early Epileptiform EEG After Cardiac Arrest.,2021-03-02,"BACKGROUND There is inconclusive evidence from observational studies to suggest that people who eat a diet rich in antioxidant vitamins (carotenoids, vitamins C, and E) or minerals (selenium and zinc) may be less likely to develop age-related macular degeneration (AMD). OBJECTIVES To determine whether or not taking antioxidant vitamin or mineral supplements, or both, prevent the development of AMD. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2017, Issue 2), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 29 March 2017), Embase Ovid (1947 to 29 March 2017), AMED (Allied and Complementary Medicine Database) (1985 to 29 March 2017), OpenGrey (System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe) (www.opengrey.eu/); searched 29 March 2017, the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch); searched 29 March 2017, ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov); searched 29 March 2017 and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en); searched 29 March 2017. We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. SELECTION CRITERIA We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing an antioxidant vitamin or mineral supplement (alone or in combination) to control. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Both review authors independently assessed risk of bias in the included studies and extracted data. One author entered data into RevMan 5; the other author checked the data entry. We pooled data using a fixed-effect model. We graded the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. MAIN RESULTS We included a total of five RCTs in this review with data available for 76,756 people. The trials were conducted in Australia, Finland, and the USA, and investigated vitamin C, vitamin E, beta-carotene, and multivitamin supplements. All trials were judged to be at low risk of bias.Four studies reported the comparison of vitamin E with placebo. Average treatment and follow-up duration ranged from 4 to 10 years. Data were available for a total of 55,614 participants. There was evidence that vitamin E supplements do not prevent the development of any AMD (risk ratio (RR) 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90 to 1.06; high-certainty evidence), and may slightly increase the risk of late AMD (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.67; moderate-certainty evidence) compared with placebo. Only one study (941 participants) reported data separately for neovascular AMD and geographic atrophy. There were 10 cases of neovascular AMD (RR 3.62, 95% CI 0.77 to 16.95; very low-certainty evidence), and four cases of geographic atrophy (RR 2.71, 95% CI 0.28 to 26.0; very low-certainty evidence). Two trials reported similar numbers of adverse events in the vitamin E and placebo groups. Another trial reported excess of haemorrhagic strokes in the vitamin E group (39 versus 23 events, hazard ratio 1.74, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.91, low-certainty evidence).Two studies reported the comparison of beta-carotene with placebo. These studies took place in Finland and the USA. Both trials enrolled men only. Average treatment and follow-up duration was 6 years and 12 years. Data were available for a total of 22,083 participants. There was evidence that beta-carotene supplements did not prevent any AMD (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.14; high-certainty evidence) nor have an important effect on late AMD (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.24; moderate-certainty evidence). Only one study (941 participants) reported data separately for neovascular AMD and geographic atrophy. There were 10 cases of neovascular AMD (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.17 to 2.15; very low-certainty evidence) and 4 cases of geographic atrophy (RR 0.31 95% CI 0.03 to 2.93; very low-certainty evidence). Beta-carotene was associated with increased risk of lung cancer in people who smoked.One study reported the comparison of vitamin C with placebo, and multivitamin (Centrum Silver) versus placebo. This was a study in men in the USA with average treatment duration and follow-up of 8 years for vitamin C and 11 years for multivitamin. Data were available for a total of 14,236 participants. AMD was assessed by self-report followed by medical record review. There was evidence that vitamin C supplementation did not prevent any AMD (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.18; high-certainty evidence) or late AMD (RR 0.94, 0.61 to 1.46; moderate-certainty evidence). There was a slight increased risk of any AMD (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.43; moderate-certainty evidence) and late AMD (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.69; moderate-certainty evidence) in the multivitamin group. Neovascular AMD and geographic atrophy were not reported separately. Adverse effects were not reported but there was possible increased risk of skin rashes in the multivitamin group.Adverse effects were not consistently reported in these eye studies, but there is evidence from other large studies that beta-carotene increases the risk of lung cancer in people who smoke or who have been exposed to asbestos.None of the studies reported quality of life or resource use and costs. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Taking vitamin E or beta-carotene supplements will not prevent or delay the onset of AMD. The same probably applies to vitamin C and the multivitamin (Centrum Silver) investigated in the one trial reported to date. There is no evidence with respect to other antioxidant supplements, such as lutein and zeaxanthin. Although generally regarded as safe, vitamin supplements may have harmful effects, and clear evidence of benefit is needed before they can be recommended. People with AMD should see the related Cochrane Review on antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplements for slowing the progression of AMD, written by the same review team.","Evans, Jennifer R; Lawrenson, John G",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd000253.pub4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28756617/,156

However, these analyses did not take into account whether the subjects were elderly. We performed a systematic review of the effects of exercise training in elderly people undergoing hemodialysis and updated the evidence of exercise for people undergoing hemodialysis by adding recent research data. Methods We searched 8 electronic databases up to June 2016. Inclusion criteria were as follows: randomized controlled trial, English publication, subjects aged 18 and older undergoing hemodialysis, evaluation of physical function as an outcome of exercise intervention. We defined elderly as age 60 years and older. The main outcomes were exercise tolerance (peak/maximum oxygen consumption) and walking ability (6-minute walk distance). Secondary outcomes were lower extremity muscle strength and quality of life. Results After screening of 10,923 references, 30 comparisons were entered into the analysis. However, because we found only 1 study in which elderly subjects were treated, we could not perform a meta-analysis for these people. For the general population undergoing hemodialysis, supervised exercise training was shown to significantly increase peak/maximum oxygen consumption (standard mean difference, 0.62; 95% confidence interval 0.38-0.87; P < 0.001), 6-minute walk distance (standard mean difference, 0.58; 95% confidence interval 0.24-0.93; P < 0.001), lower extremity muscle strength (standard mean difference, 0.94; 95% confidence interval 0.67-1.21; P < 0.001), and quality of life (standard mean difference, 0.53; 95% confidence interval 0.52-0.82; P < 0.001). Discussion Our analysis on the effectiveness of exercise training in elderly people undergoing hemodialysis as compared with nonelderly people was somewhat inconclusive. Future studies should be carried out for elderly people to identify the most favorable exercise program for this population.","Matsuzawa, Ryota; Hoshi, Keika; Yoneki, Kei; Harada, Manae; Watanabe, Takaaki; Shimoda, Takahiro; Yamamoto, Shuhei; Matsunaga, Atsuhiko",Kidney international reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ekir.2017.06.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29270518/,156
121697,Prevalence of viral infections in Norwegian cats with and without feline lower urinary tract disease.,2012,"OBJECTIVE To investigate the clinical significance of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in classification of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS A retrospective analysis was performed on 72 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the critical ward of Cancer Center of Union Hospital Affiliated to Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan from February to March in 2020. The patients were divided into two groups: moderate type (non-severe group) and severe/critical type (severe group). The results of white blood cell count (WBC), neutrophil count (NEU), lymphocyte count (LYM), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and D-dimer were collected at the 2nd day after admission from the two groups, and the NLR was calculated. The diagnostic value of WBC, NEU, LYM, IL-6, D-dimer and NLR on COVID-19 classification was evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. RESULTS A total of 72 COVID-19 patients were enrolled, among whom 52 were moderate, 17 were severe, and 3 were critical. The most common clinical manifestations of patients were fever (70.8%), cough (36.1%), chest tightness and breathlessness (37.5%), diarrhea (15.3%), fatigue (15.3%), vomiting and nausea (11.1%), occasionally accompanied by acute dyspnea (2.8%), and only one patient had no clinical symptom (1.4%). The levels of WBC, NEU, IL-6, D-dimer and NLR in the severe group were significantly higher than those in the non-severe group [WBC (×109/L): 7.81±3.65 vs. 5.34±1.69, NEU (×109/L): 5.83±3.13 vs. 3.24±1.53, IL-6 (ng/L): 133.63 (71.09, 249.61) vs. 28.05 (6.41, 101.24), D-dimer (mg/L): 0.86 (0.31, 2.56) vs. 0.33 (0.20, 0.71), NLR: 6.14±4.75 vs. 2.66±1.93, all P < 0.05], and the level of LYM was significantly lower than that in the non-severe group (×109/L: 1.09±0.56 vs. 1.49±0.74, P < 0.05). The results of ROC curve analysis showed that the areas under ROC curve (AUC) of WBC, NEU, LYM, IL-6, D-dimer and NLR for COVID-19 classification were 0.790 [95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 0.684-0.897), 0.869 (95%CI was 0.789-0.949), 0.719 (95%CI was 0.592-0.847), 0.790 (95%CI was 0.682-0.898), 0.676 (95%CI was 0.526-0.827), and 0.888 (95%CI was 0.814-0.963) respectively. The AUC of NLR was the highest, which was of high diagnostic value; when the optimum cut-off value of NLR was 3.00, the sensitivity was 100%, and the specificity was 73.1%. CONCLUSIONS NLR can be used as a biomarker to predict classification of COVID-19 patients independently, which can provide a theoretical basis for the classification management of COVID-19 patients.","Fei, Mingming; Tong, Fei; Tao, Xiaogen; Wang, Jinquan",Zhonghua wei zhong bing ji jiu yi xue,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn121430-20200413-00506; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32576346/,156

Moreover, it was examined whether swallowing variables and a valid clinic measure of orofacial myofunctional status were associated. MATERIAL AND METHODS Twenty-three patients with chronic TMD, diagnosed with disc displacement with reduction (DDR) and pain, according to the Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (DC/TMD), and 27 healthy volunteers (control group) were compared. Surface electromyography (EMG) of the temporalis, masseter, sternocleidomastoid, and suprahyoid muscles was performed during swallowing tasks of thin liquid (10 and 15 mL) and spontaneous saliva. Data were normalized. RESULTS Compared to the control group, TMD patients showed a prolonged duration of swallowing for liquid and saliva and required a longer time to reach the activity peak and half the integral. While the overall mean value of the relative peaks was similar for the groups, the suprahyoid peak was significantly lower in the TMD group during swallowing of liquid. Moreover, TMD patients recruited the jaw elevator muscles proportionally more than controls. The orofacial myofunctional status was moderately correlated with EMG parameters. CONCLUSION Patients with chronic TMD showed temporal prolongation and changes in the relative activity of the muscles during the swallowing tasks. CLINICAL RELEVANCE The present results contribute additional evidence regarding the reorganization of muscle activity in patients with chronic TMD.","Fassicollo, Carlos Eduardo; Machado, Bárbara Cristina Zanandréa; Garcia, Denny Marcos; de Felício, Cláudia Maria",Clinical oral investigations,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00784-018-2760-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30488118/,156

123388,Dural arteriovenous fistula at the craniocervical junction mimicking acute brainstem and spinal cord infarction.,2013,"BACKGROUND Drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) has become an important diagnostic examination tool in the treatment decision process for surgical therapies in the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Currently, there is a variety of regimes for the performance of DISE, which renders comparison and assessment across results difficult. It remains unclear how the different regimes influence the findings of the examination and the resulting conclusions and treatment recommendations. This study aimed to investigate the correlation between increasing levels of sedation (i.e., light, medium, and deep) induced by propofol using a target-controlled infusion (TCI) pump, with the obstruction patterns at the levels of the velum, oropharynx, tongue base, and epiglottis (i.e., VOTE classification). A second goal was the establishment of a sufficient sedation level to enable a reliable decision regarding treatment recommendations. MATERIAL AND METHODS Forty-three patients with OSA underwent a DISE procedure using propofol TCI. Three levels of sedation were defined, depending on entropy levels and assessment of sedation: light sedation, medium sedation, and deep sedation. The evaluation of the upper airway at each level, with increasing sedation, was documented using the VOTE classification. The elapsed time at which each assessment was performed was recorded. RESULTS Upper airway changes occurred and were measured throughout the DISE procedure. Clinically useful determinations of airway closure occurred at medium sedation; this level of sedation was most probably achieved with a blood propofol concentration of 3.2 μg/ml. In all 43 patients, definite treatment decisions could be made at medium sedation level. Increasing sedation did not result in changes in the treatment decision. CONCLUSIONS Changes in upper airway collapse during DISE with propofol TCI occur at levels of medium sedation. Decisions regarding surgical treatment could be made at this level of sedation.

123558,Sex Hormones and Lung Inflammation.,2021,"OBJECTIVE The risk of myocardial damage after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been controversial. The purpose of this study is to report the incidence of abnormal cardiovascular findings in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I student-athletes with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. DESIGN This is a case series of student-athletes with SARS-CoV-2 infection and their subsequent cardiac work-up, including troponin level, electrocardiogram, and echocardiogram. Additional testing was ordered as clinically indicated. SETTING This study was conducted at a single NCAA Division I institution. PARTICIPANTS Student-athletes were included if they tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR or antibody testing [immunoglobulin G (IgG)] from April 15, 2020 to October 31, 2020. INTERVENTION Cardiac testing was conducted as part of postinfection screening. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES This study was designed to quantify abnormal cardiovascular screening results and cardiac diagnoses after SARS-CoV-2 infection in Division I collegiate athletes. RESULTS Fifty-five student-athletes tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Of these, 14 (26%) had a positive IgG and 41 (74%) had a positive PCR test. Eight abnormal cardiovascular screening evaluations necessitated further testing including cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI). Two athletes received new cardiac diagnoses, one probable early cardiomyopathy and one pericarditis, whereas the remaining 6 had normal cMRIs. CONCLUSIONS These data support recent publications which recommend the de-escalation of cardiovascular testing such as cardiac MRI or echocardiogram for athletes who have recovered from asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Continued follow-up of these athletes for sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 is critical.","Hwang, Calvin E; Kussman, Andrea; Christle, Jeffrey W; Froelicher, Victor; Wheeler, Matthew T; Moneghetti, Kegan J",Clinical journal of sport medicine : official journal of the Canadian Academy of Sport Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/jsm.0000000000000954; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34173780/,156

It is debatable whether asymptomatic COVID-19 virus carriers are contagious. We report here a case of the asymptomatic patient and present clinical characteristics of 455 contacts, which aims to study the infectivity of asymptomatic carriers. MATERIAL AND METHODS 455 contacts who were exposed to the asymptomatic COVID-19 virus carrier became the subjects of our research. They were divided into three groups: 35 patients, 196 family members and 224 hospital staffs. We extracted their epidemiological information, clinical records, auxiliary examination results and therapeutic schedules. RESULTS The median contact time for patients was four days and that for family members was five days. Cardiovascular disease accounted for 25% among original diseases of patients. Apart from hospital staffs, both patients and family members were isolated medically. During the quarantine, seven patients plus one family member appeared new respiratory symptoms, where fever was the most common one. The blood counts in most contacts were within a normal range. All CT images showed no sign of COVID-19 infection. No severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections was detected in 455 contacts by nucleic acid test. CONCLUSION In summary, all the 455 contacts were excluded from SARS-CoV-2 infection and we conclude that the infectivity of some asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers might be weak.","Gao, Ming; Yang, Lihui; Chen, Xuefu; Deng, Yiyu; Yang, Shifang; Xu, Hanyi; Chen, Zixing; Gao, Xinglin",Respiratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rmed.2020.106026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32513410/,156

METHODS A systematic search was performed in the CINAHL, EMBASE, PsyInfo, MEDLINE, Cochrane Libraries, SCOPUS and Web of Science databases for English-language publications from January 2008 till October 2018 using a combination of MeSH-terms and keywords related to patient feedback, quality of health care, patient-centred care, program evaluation and public hospitals. The quality appraisal of the studies was conducted with the MMAT and the review protocol was published on PROSPERO. Narrative synthesis was used for evaluation of the effectiveness of the interventions on patient-centred quality of care. RESULTS Twenty papers reporting 20 studies met the inclusion criteria, of these, there was one cluster RCT, three before and after studies, four cross-sectional studies and 12 organisational case studies. In the quality appraisal, 11 studies were rated low, five medium and only two of high methodological quality. Two studies could not be appraised because insufficient information was provided. The papers reported on interventions to improve communication with patients, professional practices in continuity of care and care transitions, responsiveness to patients, patient education, the physical hospital environment, use of patient feedback by staff and on quality improvement projects. However, quantitative outcomes were only provided for interventions in the areas of communication, professional practices in continuity of care and care transitions and responsiveness to patients. Multi-component interventions which targeted both individual and organisational levels were more effective than single interventions. Outcome measures reported in the studies were patient experiences across various diverse dimensions including, communication, responsiveness, coordination of and access to care, or patient satisfaction with waiting times, physical environment and staff courtesy. CONCLUSION Overall, it was found that there is limited evidence on the effectiveness of interventions, because few have been tested in well-designed trials, very few papers described the theoretical basis on which the intervention had been developed. Further research is needed to understand the choice and mechanism of action of the interventions used to improve patient experience.","Wong, Eunice; Mavondo, Felix; Fisher, Jane",BMC health services research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-020-05383-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32527314/,156

We investigated the effect of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) on morbidly obese diabetics and examined the short-term impact of LSG on diabetic medication cost. Methods. A prospective database of consecutive bariatric patients was reviewed. Morbidly obese patients with type 2 diabetes who underwent LSG were included in the study. Age, gender, body mass index (BMI), diabetic medication use, glucose, insulin, and HbA1c levels were documented preoperatively, and at 2 weeks, 2 months, 6 months, and 12 months postoperatively. Insulin resistance was estimated using the homeostatic model assessment (HOMA). Use and cost of diabetic medications were followed. Results. Of 178 patients, 22 were diabetics who underwent LSG. Diabetes remission was observed in 62% of patients within 2 months and in 75% of patients within 12 months. HOMA-IR improved after only two weeks following surgery (16.5 versus 6.6, P < 0.001). Average number of diabetic medications decreased from 2.2 to <1, within 2 weeks after surgery; corresponding to a diabetes medication cost savings of 80%, 91%, 99%, and 99.7% after 2 weeks, 2 months, 6 months, and 12 months, respectively. Conclusion. Morbidly obese patients with diabetes who undergo LSG have high rates of diabetes remission early after surgery. This translates to a significant medication cost savings.","Slater, Bethany J; Bellatorre, Nina; Eisenberg, Dan",Journal of obesity,https://doi.org/10.1155/2011/350523; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22187636/,156
125873,Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics: news.,2021-07-03,"BACKGROUND Anastomotic leak following esophagectomy is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. A major factor determining anastomotic success is an adequate blood supply to the conduit. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of intraoperative evaluation of the conduit's vascular supply on anastomotic failure after esophagectomy. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed data from 90 consecutive patients undergoing esophagectomy with gastric conduit reconstruction. A change in surgical practice occurred after 60 cases were completed, when we introduced the use of intraoperative indocyanine green fluorescence angiography and Doppler examination to evaluate blood supply and assist in construction of the conduit. The leak rates before and after implementation of conduit vascular evaluation were compared. RESULTS After the introduction of intraoperative vascular evaluation of the gastric conduit, we noted a dramatic decrease in the rate of anastomotic leak from 20 % in the first 60 patients to 0 % in the succeeding 30 patients. CONCLUSIONS Intraoperative vascular evaluation with indocyanine green fluorescence imaging and Doppler examination of the gastric conduit used to assist reconstruction after esophagectomy allows for enhanced construction of the conduit that maximizes blood supply to the anastomosis. This change in practice was associated with a significant reduction in anastomotic leak rate.","Campbell, Chase; Reames, Mark K; Robinson, Myra; Symanowski, James; Salo, Jonathan C",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11605-015-2794-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25791907/,156

The current cluster randomized controlled trial examines the effects of mindfulness intervention vs. active control program (i.e., relaxation) focusing on the main EFs (i.e., working memory, response inhibition, cognitive processing, cognitive flexibility and verbal fluency). A total of 131 students from 6th grade and 8th grade (median age 12 and 15) from four comprehensive schools participated. The schools were to equal shares randomized to intervention and active control groups, i.e., groups who underwent a 9-week mindfulness practice or relaxation program, respectively. Participants completed a cognitive test-package at baseline/pre-intervention, post-intervention at 9 weeks and follow-up at 6 months. Both intervention and active relaxation-based control groups improved on a majority of EF measures at both 9 weeks and 6 months. There was no significant difference between the mindfulness intervention group and the active control program in EFs. The current study suggests that mindfulness intervention and active control program do not differ in their effects to EFs, although both may have positive outcomes. Further research with both active and inactive control groups is needed to map the potential benefits of similar programs for cognitive functioning.","Lassander, Maarit; Hintsanen, Mirka; Suominen, Sakari; Mullola, Sari; Fagerlund, Åse; Vahlberg, Tero; Volanen, Salla-Maarit",Developmental neuropsychology,https://doi.org/10.1080/87565641.2020.1856109; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33305618/,156

However, the accumulation pattern seems to be species dependent. For this study, specimens of Philoscia affinis (Isopoda, Oniscidea) and soil samples were collected from both a protected area (site 1) and urban roadside (site 2) in the low plain of Friuli-Venezia Giulia (northeast Italy) to determine whether P. affinis could serve as a potential candidate for monitoring soil contamination. To do this, the following objectives were achieved: a) the level of trace elements (Al, Cd, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn, Pb, Zn) were detected in soils and isopods; 2) the difference in trace elements accumulation was compared in the two sampling sites; 3) the bioaccumulation factor (BAF) was calculated for each element. With some exceptions, trace element concentrations were higher in both isopods and soil samples from the urban roadside compared to the protected area. Furthermore, except for Cd, Cu, and Zn, trace element levels were higher in the soil than in the isopod samples. The higher mean BAF values were recorded for Cd (6.169 and 6.974 for site 1 and 2, respectively), Cu (10.324 and 11.452 for site 1 and 2, respectively), and Zn (1.836 and 2: 1.943 for site 1 and 2, respectively), whereas BAF values <1 were recorded for the other elements. Philoscia affinis was found to be a potential candidate to monitor soil contamination as a macro-concentrator of Cu and Cd and a micro-concentrator of Zn.","Pastorino, Paolo; Bertoli, Marco; Brizio, Paola; Abete, Maria Cesarina; Dalla Nora, Vittoria; Prearo, Marino; Pizzul, Elisabetta",Biological trace element research,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12011-021-02573-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423135/,156

132765,Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics: news.,2021-06-03,"ABSTRACT Adolescence is a time known for risky behaviors and often the initiation of alcohol use. Readily available, alcohol is often one of the drugs of choice for adolescents. Whereas in the past 30 years, the overall consumption of alcohol is down, the data in the past 10 years have shown more girls are binge drinking and meeting criteria for alcohol use disorder (AUD). The alarm of early alcohol use is the association with problems with the substances later in life. Historically, men and male adolescents consumed more alcohol than females. Recent studies indicate girls' alcohol use surpasses boys, whereas women now are developing AUD at the same rate as men. The consequences of early use can result in women's increased risk for multiple cancers, having a more severe form of AUD with less alcohol consumption as well as premature death. To further exacerbate this growing concern, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has created a perfect storm for increased use of alcohol to cope with the stress of living in an uncertain world. Normal daily activities have been halted with the uncertainty of school closures, zoom classroom sessions, and living in mandated social isolation. All nurses need to be screening for how families under their care have been managing stress. The time is opportune to educate and support parents in engaging their children in conversations around substance use. Parents can be supported to increase awareness of their own coping mechanisms and strengthen positive coping. Adolescents need support to strengthen interpersonal skills as well as make informed decisions concerning when and how they engage in alcohol consumption. This article will illuminate the growing need for all healthcare providers to assess and guide adolescents' coping skills during COVID with a focus on mental health, high-risk behavior, and alcohol use.","Smith, Tedra S; Bryant, Pamela Harris; Fogger, Susanne Astrab",Journal of addictions nursing,https://doi.org/10.1097/jan.0000000000000388; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33646720/,156

An analysis of histopathological files from the surgical department between 2017 and 2019 was calculated. These items were selected: sex, age, type of skin cancer, subtype of basal cell carcinoma (BCC), grading of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), localization and dimensions of the tumor. The study sample consisted of 387 cases. BCC was the most common cancer and its nodular type was the most frequent. In older patients, the vertical dimension of excised carcinoma was significantly larger. Moreover, this connection was detected only in women compared to men. There were statistically significant differences between dimensions of the skin cancer and sex. In men group, skin cancers had statistically higher vertical dimensions and larger surface areas. On the face and head, BCC more often localizes in the nasal area, while SCC on the auricle. It has been demonstrated that the older the patient, the larger the vertical dimension of the tumor. As such, tumor size is larger in men than in women, as women usually see their physicians sooner than men: cosmetic concerns are more important to them.","Fijałkowska, Marta; Koziej, Mateusz; Antoszewski, Bogusław",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-91942-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34117314/,156

By fixing the duty ratio of silver nano-gratings, the proposed color filter can maintain identical optical properties for orthogonal polarization, while the etalon structure of the proposed color filter can manipulate different color information depending on the cavity height for the horizontal polarization. Finally, we experimentally confirm that polarization-dependent security images can be generated using the proposed color filters with a fixed duty ratio of various nano-grating arrays.","Jung, Yonghee; Jung, Hyunseung; Choi, Hyunyong; Lee, Hojin",Nano letters,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.nanolett.0c01738; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32816490/,156

Therefore, we used the density functional theory method and quantum theory of atoms in molecules to investigate drug-drug interactions involving Remdesivir and Favipiravir. The computed parameters were related to the antiviral actions of both drugs together. The results indicate enhanced antiviral activity and it will be worthy to consider additional investigations with the combination of these two drugs.","Parlak, Cemal; Alver, Özgür; Ouma, Cecil N M; Rhyman, Lydia; Ramasami, Ponnadurai",Drug research,https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1585-1323; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34535038/,156

137049,"Ultrasonographic, endoscopic and histological appearance of the caecum in clinically healthy cats.",2017,"Coronaviruses demonstrate great potential for interspecies transmission, including zoonotic outbreaks. Although bovine coronavirus (BCoV) strains are frequently circulating in cattle farms worldwide, causing both enteric and respiratory disease, little is known about their genomic evolution. We sequenced and analysed the full-length spike (S) protein gene of 33 BCoV strains from dairy and feedlot farms collected during outbreaks that occurred from 2002 to 2010 in Sweden and Denmark. Amino acid identities were >97 % for the BCoV strains analysed in this work. These strains formed a clade together with Italian BCoV strains and were highly similar to human enteric coronavirus HECV-4408/US/94. A high similarity was observed between BCoV, canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) and human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43). Molecular clock analysis of the S gene sequences estimated BCoV and CRCoV diverged from a common ancestor in 1951, while the time of divergence from a common ancestor of BCoV and HCoV-OC43 was estimated to be 1899. BCoV strains showed the lowest similarity to equine coronavirus, placing the date of divergence at the end of the eighteenth century. Two strongly positive selection sites were detected along the receptor-binding subunit of the S protein gene: spanning amino acid residues 109-131 and 495-527. By contrast, the fusion subunit was observed to be under negative selection. The selection pattern along the S glycoprotein implies adaptive evolution of BCoVs, suggesting a successful mechanism for BCoV to continuously circulate among cattle and other ruminants without disappearance.","Bidokhti, Mehdi R M; Tråvén, Madeleine; Krishna, Neel K; Munir, Muhammad; Belák, Sándor; Alenius, Stefan; Cortey, Martí",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.054940-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23804565/,156

In this study, we propose a highly sensitive magnetic DNA sensor based on nucleic acid hybridization reaction and magnetic signal readout. We design the L. monocytogenes specific probe1 and probe2 and label them on the 30 and 250 nm magnetic nanoparticles, respectively. The hybridization reaction between the magnetic probes and DNA of L. monocytogenes could form a sandwich nanocomplex. After magnetic separation, the unbound MNP30-probe2 can act as the transverse relaxation time (T2) signal readout probe. This assay allows the one-step detection of L. monocytogenes as low as 50 CFU/mL within 2 h without DNA amplification, and the average recovery in the spiked ham sausage samples can reach 92.6%. This system integrates the high sensitivity of magnetic sensing and high efficiency of hybridization reaction, providing a promising detection platform for pathogens.","Qi, Xiaobao; Wang, Zhilong; Lu, Rongsheng; Liu, Jiawei; Li, Yue; Chen, Yiping",Food chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.127837; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818863/,156

139144,Evaluation of e-OSPE as compared to traditional OSPE: A pilot study.,2021-03-04,"BACKGROUND High-resolution esophageal manometry with impedance (HREMI) performed with supine patient positioning is used to evaluate patients for esophageal dysmotility. However, most patients experience symptoms related to esophageal dysmotility when eating or drinking upright. The aims of this study are to: (1) compare HREMI metrics in supine versus upright position; and (2) determine if upright position alters motility characterization of patients. METHODS HREMI of twelve wet swallows in supine position and five wet swallows in upright position were performed on normal subjects (NS) and consecutive patients. Chicago Classification v3.0 (CC) diagnoses were evaluated in the supine position and a modified version of the Chicago Classification system was used in the upright position using normative upright values for DCI and IRP. RESULTS DCI decreased in NS by 414 mmHg × cm × sec (p = 0.001) and patients by 613 mmHg × cm × sec (p < 0.001). IRP decreased in NS by 6.2 mmHg (p < 0.001) and patients by 4.6 mmHg (p < 0.001). The rate of successful bolus clearance decreased in the upright position in patients by 11% (p < 0.001), but no statistically significant differences were observed in NS. 82 of 200 patients (41%) had a change in CC diagnosis in the upright position. Bolus clearance in the upright position varied in patients depending on their diagnosis in the upright position. CONCLUSIONS Upright swallows had lower LES, IRP, DCI and UES pressures in both normal subjects and patients with decreased bolus clearance in patients. Upright positioning can alter esophageal motility patterns and enhance diagnostic yield. Thus, upright swallows supplement supine swallows to help characterize esophageal dysmotility.","Tanner, Samuel; Vachhani, Herit; Harrison, Martha; Malik, Zubair; Schey, Ron; Parkman, Henry P",Esophagus : official journal of the Japan Esophageal Society,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10388-021-00849-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33974190/,156

142537,Letter from the editor.,2020-10-02,"BACKGROUND Natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES), a recent development in the field of minimally invasive surgery, provides theoretical advantages over open and laparoscopic surgery. Challenges with the use of NOTES for colon resections include the need to extract a large specimen and perform an intestinal anastomosis. A transanal single-port laparoscopic proctectomy uses the potential advantages of NOTES yet provides easy specimen extraction and anastomosis. METHODS Fresh frozen then thawed human cadavers were used. Access was obtained via transanal mucosectomy, and a transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) system was used to perform the proctectomy once the procedure was above the pelvic floor. After the peritoneal cavity was entered, a hand port was placed through the sphincter and above the pelvic floor. The left colon was mobilized using two 5-mm working ports and a 10-mm camera port for the flexible-tipped laparoscope that were placed through the hand port. The specimen was removed transanally. RESULTS The critical steps for an oncologic resection of the rectum were achieved using a combination of TEM and laparoscopic instrumentation transanally. The rectum and mesorectum were mobilized. The left ureter was identified and preserved, the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) ligated at its origin, the inferior mesenteric vein ligated near the ligament of Treitz, the proximal colon mobilized for transanal extraction, the specimen resected proximal to the ligated IMA, and a hand-sewn coloanal anastomosis performed. Postresection examination showed preservation of the hypogastric nerves and an intact mesorectum. Challenges included maneuverability around the sacral promontory and length of the instruments. However, this was easily overcome by the use of long reticulating instruments and a flexible-tipped laparoscope. CONCLUSIONS Transanal single-port low anterior resection using TEM and laparoscopic techniques is feasible and can maintain the principles of an oncologic resection.","Fajardo, Alyssa D; Hunt, Steven R; Fleshman, James W; Mutch, Matthew G",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-009-0838-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20054571/,156

The aim of targeting the immune system to recognize and destroy cancer cells has afforded many patients the prospect of achieving deep, long-term remission and potential cures. However, many challenges remain for achieving the goal of effective immunotherapy for all cancer patients. Checkpoint inhibitors have been able to achieve long-term responses in a minority of patients, yet improving response rates with combination therapies increases the possibility of toxicity. Chimeric antigen receptor T cells have demonstrated high response rates in hematological cancers, although most patients experience relapse. In addition, some cancers are notoriously immunologically ""cold"" and typically are not effective targets for immunotherapy. Overcoming these obstacles will require new strategies to improve upon the efficacy of current agents, identify biomarkers to select appropriate therapies, and discover new modalities to expand the accessibility of immunotherapy to additional tumor types and patient populations.","Cable, Jennifer; Greenbaum, Benjamin; Pe'er, Dana; Bollard, Catherine M; Bruni, Sofia; Griffin, Matthew E; Allison, James P; Wu, Catherine J; Subudhi, Sumit K; Mardis, Elaine R; Brentjens, Renier; Sosman, Jeffry A; Cemerski, Saso; Zavitsanou, Anastasia-Maria; Proia, Theresa; Egeblad, Mikala; Nolan, Garry; Goswami, Sangeeta; Spranger, Stefani; Mackall, Crystal L",Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,https://doi.org/10.1111/nyas.14526; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33184911/,156

Methods Medical Research Council guidelines for developing complex interventions informed intervention development and feasibility testing. This included identifying the evidence base and theory (establishing HOP theory of change, a systematic review on decision-making in dementia, a stakeholder consultation), modelling the intervention materials with research experts (creation of version 1.0) and experts by experience (creation of version 2.0), and pilot testing the intervention recording participant observations and facilitator reflections. The final version of the intervention materials was developed with experts by experience of dementia where the accessibility of language and appropriate styles of facilitation were the focus. Results The concept of the intervention was strongly endorsed by respondents of the stakeholder consultation (209/226). Stakeholder preferences included face-to-face delivery, a manualized workbook approach and the inclusion of the primary carer during intervention delivery. Recruitment for intervention groups took place in non-NHS settings (2 small groups recruited) and NHS settings (no groups recruited). In non-NHS settings, 7 dyads agreed to take part in one of two intervention groups. Both intervention groups had over 70% attendance by participants (group 1: 72.2% group 2: 87.5%).

144172,Use of intestine-related biomarkers for detecting intestinal epithelial damage in neonatal calves with diarrhea.,2020-02-01,"Bipolar radiofrequency-induced thermo-fusion has been explored as an advanced surgical method for intestinal anastomoses; however, the histological characteristics of collagen denaturation and injuries arising from this process remain unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the microcosmic changes and tissue damage of fusion regions with various parameters of injury. Ex vivo colons of pigs were fused serosa-serosa on two carrier rings, which were installed on a homemade anastomotic device. Five levels of compressive pressure from 171 to 313 kPa were applied for 5s to fuse the colons under radiofrequency power of 160 W, and then the collagen denaturation of the fused region was examined by transmission electron microscopy. Light microscopy was utilized to observe histological slices that were stained with picrosirius red in order to visualize the tissue injuries under two levels of radiofrequency power (120 vs. 140 W) and operation time (5 vs. 10s). Transmission electron micrographs showed that increased compressive pressure led to thicker denatured collagen fibrils and wider gaps between each collagen fibril. Serosa adhesion regions appeared abundant in collagen. No histological differences were observed when 120 W of power was applied for 5 and 10s. Significant muscle cracking occurred when colons were fused using 140 W for 5s. When the operation time was extended to 10s, 140 W led to tight fusion and less splitting on muscles. These results suggest that higher compressive pressure results in more severe collagen unfolding and also reduces collagen crosslinking in fused colons. Improved radiofrequency power along with operation time could avoid tissue injury upon radiofrequency-induced colonic anastomoses.","Zhao, Lingxi; Zhuo, Changhua; Song, Chengli; Li, Xinxiang; Zhou, Yu; Shi, Debing","Pathology, research and practice",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prp.2014.10.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25434604/,156
144598,In vivo imaging of abdominal aortic aneurysms: increased FDG uptake suggests inflammation in the aneurysm wall.,2008,"BACKGROUND Published comparisons of the different available laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) devices focused on its economic cost and technical aspects. With this study, we aimed to objectively compare the use of three different LESS access devices in controlled experimental tasks. MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty subjects participated in simulator trials. A cut and an intracorporeal suturing task were carried out. Three single access devices (SILS: SILS(TM) Port, GPN. GelPOINT Advanced Access Platform, and XCN: XCONE) were used according to a randomized nine-session schedule. Completion time was registered and performance objectively assessed with task-specific rating scales. Two blinded expert raters worked over video recordings of the hands-on sessions. RESULTS Participants showed improvement with all devices on total cut completion times and significantly for SILS (P = 0.017). The GPN decreased its adapted Global Rating Scale score (P = 0.002) from the first (W1) to the last week (W9). On the suture task, XCN constituted the device with longer completion times compared with SILS (P < 0.001) and to GPN (P < 0.001). There was significant improvement in times from W1 to W9 with XCN (P < 0.001), SILS (P = 0.003), and GPN (P < 0.001). On average summative score, we observed significant improvement in performance with all devices from W1 to W9 (SILS: P = 0.003; GPN: P = 0.001; and XCN: P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Although we advise surgeons to focus on the specific procedures and patient characteristics to select the most adequate access device to maintain procedural safety standards, single-use devices appear to confer an easier adaptation to LESS surgery.","Matos-Azevedo, Ana Maria; Díaz-Guëmes Martín-Portugués, Idoia; Pérez-Duarte, Francisco Julián; Sánchez-Hurtado, Miguel Ángel; Sánchez-Margallo, Francisco Miguel",The Journal of surgical research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2014.06.017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25033704/,156

147400,Letter from the editor.,2021-09-02,"The first monolithic state-of-the-art controller was proposed and implemented for an electric scalpel system. A piezoelectric transducer (PT) is driven in ultrasonic resonant frequency to generate electromechanical power for thermal sealing and cold dissection operations. The band-pass filter based oscillator was developed to automatically track the PT's optimal longitudinal resonance. However, under heavy loading conditions, the PT will lock to other unwanted transverse resonant modes and deliver no usable power to the surgical tip. To prevent this abnormal operation, a phase-locked loop based frequency discriminator with intervention and release logic was developed to ensure that the PT always operates at the proper frequency of 55.5 kHz. Another crucial challenge is that the changing of loading conditions induces a motional current sensing mismatch and a pole-zero pair, consequently causing instability and poor response time. Therefore, a sliding mode control method with reduced-order sensing was proposed to handle the extreme load changes and provide a fast power build-up time of 9.2 ms, which is 8% faster than previously reported designs and 49% faster than the best commercial product.

The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate safety outcomes of deep sedation with monitored anesthesia care (MAC) versus general endotracheal anesthesia (GETA). METHODS Individualized search strategies were performed in accordance with PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines. This meta-analysis was performed by calculating pooled proportions using random effects models. Measured outcomes included procedure success, all-cause and anesthesia-associated adverse events, and post-procedure recovery time. Heterogeneity was assessed with I2 statistics and publication bias by funnel plot and Egger regression testing. RESULTS Five studies (MAC: n = 1284 vs GETA: n = 615) were included. Patients in the GETA group were younger, had higher body mass index (BMI), and higher mean ASA scores (all P < 0.001) with no difference in Mallampati scores (P = 0.923). Procedure success, all-cause adverse events, and anesthesia-associated events were similar between groups [OR 1.16 (95% CI 0.51-2.64); OR 1.16 (95% CI 0.29-4.70); OR 1.33 (95% CI 0.27-6.49), respectively]. MAC resulted in fewer hypotensive episodes [OR 0.32 (95% CI 0.12-0.87], increased hypoxemic events [OR 5.61 (95% CI 1.54-20.37)], and no difference in cardiac arrhythmias [OR 0.48 (95% CI 0.13-1.78)].

The large size, distinctive neck anatomy, and supply of the brain parenchyma by the outflow tract pose technical challenges in treatment. The aim of this study was to discuss the endovascular treatment results and illustrate the dynamic nature of serpentine aneurysms. Spontaneous transformation of saccular and fusiform aneurysms into serpentine morphology, along with a case of serpentine-into-fusiform aneurysm transformation during follow-up, is presented. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective analysis from 3 institutions revealed 15 patients with serpentine aneurysms who underwent diagnostic evaluation and endovascular treatment. Nine of the 15 patients underwent endovascular occlusion of the parent vessel with detachable balloon or coils. Six of the 15 patients underwent aneurysm and parent artery occlusion with coiling. RESULTS In 11 patients, improvement or resolution of symptoms was achieved by an endovascular approach without any treatment-related morbidity. Morbidity related to treatment in the immediate postoperative period was seen in 3 patients, with resolution of the deficits at long-term follow-up in 2 patients and persistence of a mild deficit in 1 patient. Endovascular treatment failed to achieve resolution of symptoms in a case with a basilar tip aneurysm treated by aneurysm coiling. CONCLUSIONS Serpentine aneurysms are dynamic structures with spontaneous transformation possible from a saccular or fusiform shape into a serpentine configuration. An endovascular approach by parent vessel occlusion or intra-aneurysmal occlusion is a successful treatment technique for serpentine aneurysms.","Kandemirli, S G; Cekirge, S; Oran, I; Saatci, I; Kizilkilic, O; Cinar, C; Islak, C; Kocer, N",AJNR.

Questionnaires measuring perioperative mental and physical strain using validated visual analog scale and Borg scales were completed. Preoperative and postoperative sleep quality of the surgeon was registered and correlated to perioperative strain parameters. RESULTS Preoperative to postoperative frustration among experienced surgeons was significantly reduced and this was not found in the inexperienced surgeons (visual analog scale: preoperative 13 (2-65) mm, postoperative 4 (0-51) mm vs. preoperative 5(0-10) mm, postoperative 5(1-46) mm; P=0.04). Physical strain was significantly induced in both groups in the upper extremities. Preoperative and postoperative sleep quality was significantly correlated to postoperative mental strain parameters.

The types of response of the immune system to the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 with the start of the inflammation process are considered. The situation is analyzed in detail in which the growing autoimmune inflammation (up to the development of a ""cytokine storm"") affects not only the pulmonary parenchyma, but also the endothelium of the small vessels of the lungs. Simultaneous damage to the alveoli and microthrombosis of the pulmonary vessels are accompanied by a progressive impairment of gas exchange, the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome, the treatment of which, even with the use of invasive ventilation, is ineffective and does not really change the prognosis of patients with COVID-19. In order to interrupt the pathological process at the earliest stages of the disease, the necessity of proactive anti-inflammatory therapy in combination with active anticoagulation treatment is substantiated. The results of the first randomized studies on the use of inhibitors of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (interleukin-6 (tocilizumab), interleukin-17 (secukinumab), Janus kinase blockers, through which the signal is transmitted to cells (ruxolitinib)), which have potential in the early treatment of COVID- 19.

149395,Reader response: Neurologic complications of coronavirus infections.,2020-08-18,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a global health threat associated with major socioeconomic disruptions. Understanding on the transmission characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 is crucial for optimizing preventive strategies. RECENT FINDINGS SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted efficiently between persons through respiratory droplets and direct and indirect contact. The significance of airborne droplet nuclei in SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the community setting is less clear. SARS-CoV-2 RNA and live viral particles may also be detected in other bodily fluids. Outbreaks have been reported in families, nursing homes, markets, restaurants, churches, shipping vessels, gyms, and healthcare facilities. Nonpharmaceutical preventive measures at both the community and individual levels are essential for reducing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. SUMMARY Because well tolerated and effective vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 are unlikely to be widely available in the near future, there is an urgent need for finding other measures to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. With better understanding of its transmission characteristics, practical nonpharmaceutical preventive measures remain essential to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission and its associated health and socioeconomic burdens.","Li, Xin; Sridhar, Siddharth; Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo",Current opinion in HIV and AIDS,https://doi.org/10.1097/coh.0000000000000650; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32969975/,156

Ultrasound examination identified a large anechoic cyst-like structure in the caudal thorax. A median sternotomy was performed, and the cystic mass was removed. Microscopically, the excised tissue was identified as a multilocular thyroglossal duct cyst with ectopic thyroid tissue. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of a mediastinal thyroglossal duct cyst in a cat. Despite the rarity of this lesion, it should be considered when a cystic thoracic structure is identified on thoracic ultrasound.

Cell viability (by Calcein-AM staining) and ECD of five grafts originally scheduled for transplantation were evaluated on the originally planned surgery day, whereas 22 grafts from paired donor corneas were evaluated either directly post-preparation or after 3-7 days of storage. ECD was analyzed by light microscopy (LM ECD) and Calcein-AM staining (Calcein-ECD).Results: Light microscopy (LM) evaluation of all grafts showed an unremarkable endothelial cell monolayer directly after preparation. However, median Calcein-ECD for the five grafts initially allocated for transplantation was 18% (range 92-73%) lower than median LM ECD. For the paired DMEK grafts, Calcein-ECD determined by Calcein-AM staining on the day of graft preparation and after 3-7 days of graft storage showed a median decrease of 1% and 2%, respectively. Median percentage of central graft area populated by viable cells after preparation and after 3-7 days of graft storage was 88% and 92%, respectively.Conclusion: Cell viability of most of the grafts will not be affected by preparation and storage. Endothelial cell damage may be observed for some grafts within hours after preparation, with insignificant additional ECD changes during 3-7 days of graft storage. Implementing an additional post-preparation step in the eye bank to evaluate cell density before graft release for transplantation may help to reduce postoperative DMEK complications.","Miron, Alina; Sajet, Anita; Groeneveld-van Beek, Esther A; Kok, Jet S; Dedeci, Mehtap; de Jong, Maloeke; Amo-Addae, Vicky; Melles, Gerrit R J; Oellerich, Silke; van der Wees, Jacqueline",Current eye research,https://doi.org/10.1080/02713683.2021.1927111; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34027768/,156

METHODS We started the procedure in May 2007, and by December 2011, 117 patients could be evaluated for a two year follow-up. Comparisons of preoperative status with 12 and 24 months postoperative status were made for body mass index (BMI), obesity-related diseases and micronutrients. RESULTS Major complications included bleeding requiring transfusion at 5.1%, leak at 1.7% and abscess without a visible leak at 0.9%. Mean BMI was reduced from 46.6 (standard deviation (SD) 6.0) kg/m2 to 30.6 (SD 5.6) kg/m2 at two years, and resolution occurred for 80.7% of patients with type 2 diabetes, 63.9% with hypertension, 75.8% with hyperlipidemia, 93.0% with sleep apnea, 31.4% with musculoskeletal pain, 85.4% with snoring and 73.3% with urinary incontinence. Amenorrhea resolved in all premenopausal females. The proportion of patients with symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease increased from 12.8% to 27.4%. The prevalence of patients with low ferritin-levels increased, while 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) deficiency decreased postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS LSG is an effective procedure for morbid obesity and obesity-related diseases, but the technique should be further explored particularly to avoid gastroesophageal reflux.","Våge, Villy; Sande, Vetle Aaberge; Mellgren, Gunnar; Laukeland, Camilla; Behme, Jan; Andersen, John Roger",BMC surgery,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2482-14-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24517247/,156

TARGET Stroke phase II was launched in April 2014 with a goal of promoting further reduction in treatment times for tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) administration. METHODS AND RESULTS We conducted a second survey of Get With The Guidelines-Stroke hospitals regarding strategies used to reduce delays after Target: Stroke and quantify their association with DTN times. A total of 16 901 ischemic stroke patients were treated with intravenous tPA within 4.5 hours of symptom onset from 888 surveyed hospitals between June 2014 and April 2015. The patient-level median DTN time was 56 minutes (interquartile range, 42-75), with 59.3% of patients receiving intravenous tPA within 60 minutes and 30.4% within 45 minutes after hospital arrival. Most hospitals reported routinely using a majority of Target: Stroke key practice strategies, although direct transport of patients to computed tomographic/magenetic resonance imaging scanner, premix of tPA ahead of time, initiation of tPA in brain imaging suite, and prompt data feedback to emergency medical services providers were used less frequently. Overall, we identified 16 strategies associated with significant reductions in DTN times. Combined, a total of 20 minutes (95% confidence intervals 15-25 minutes) could be saved if all strategies were implemented. CONCLUSIONS Get With The Guidelines-Stroke hospitals have initiated a majority of Target: Stroke-recommended strategies to reduce DTN times in acute ischemic stroke. Nevertheless, certain strategies were infrequently practiced and represent a potential immediate target for further improvements.","Xian, Ying; Xu, Haolin; Lytle, Barbara; Blevins, Jason; Peterson, Eric D; Hernandez, Adrian F; Smith, Eric E; Saver, Jeffrey L; Messé, Steven R; Paulsen, Mary; Suter, Robert E; Reeves, Mathew J; Jauch, Edward C; Schwamm, Lee H; Fonarow, Gregg C",Circulation.

However, there have been no studies examining the relationship between the type of stress felt by an individual due to such changes in social conditions and the degree of change in HbA1c, prompting us to conduct this study. Methods We conducted a collaborative study at two diabetes clinics. A total of 1,000 subjects responded to the questionnaire. Data on HbA1c and body weight before and after the declaration of the state of emergency were collected. Results We conducted a questionnaire on some stressors, but when comparing the two groups with respect to whether or not they felt stress from each item, only ""school closures for children,"" seemed to be associated with a significant difference in the amount of change in HbA1c. In the stressed group, i.e. the group of parents who experienced stress due to their children's schools being closed, the HbA1c value changed from 7.30±0.78 to 7.30±1.13 (p=0.985). By contrast, in the unstressed group, the HbA1c value significantly decreased from 7.28±0.98 to 7.06±0.85 (p<0.001). In addition, as a result of comparing the amount of change between the 2 groups, a significant decrease was observed in the unstressed group compared with the stressed group (p=0.032). There was no significant difference in body weight change between the two groups. Conclusion Stress that cannot be avoided by one's own will, such as school closures for children, may affect glycemic control.","Masuda, Mio; Tomonaga, Osamu",Internal medicine,https://doi.org/10.2169/internalmedicine.8134-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34645764/,156
155629,Dietary Supplements for COVID-19.,2021,"Global food production systems are currently under scrutiny, in particular the health, nutrition, and environmental impacts of livestock-derived food (LDF). Despite South Africa's recent socio-economic transformation and increased per-capita LDF consumption, the triple burden of malnutrition persists. Policy responses to such complex problems often fail because of linear thinking with short-term goals. However, a systems approach helps identify root causes, feedback mechanisms, potential unintended consequences, and opportunities for integrated, durable solutions. Participation in the systems-thinking process improves stakeholder understanding and buy-in. Our participatory workshop facilitated the development of a systems map for South African LDF, identifying key system elements, linkages, and nexus points. The latter included climate change, land access and management, livestock management and productivity, farming systems, food safety, policy articulation, agricultural knowledge, and income. Based on these findings, and an overview of related literature, we produced a conceptual system dynamics model of the LDF system. We identified key vari-ables and causal relationships, vicious and virtuous loops, system archetypes, conceptual stock and flows, and links to Sustainable Development Goals. The LDF system is complex and dynamic, with a dominance of commercial enterprises across agriculture and food retail, presenting barriers for small and medium-scale individuals. Other key elements relate to population growth and urbanization, land access, deregulation of international trade, climate change vulnerability, feed production limitations, and food safety. Our work provides a unique reference for policymakers, identifying the need for deep structural change, highlighting the possible unintended consequences, and thereby mitigating the risk of system destabilization.","Queenan, Kevin; Sobratee, Nafiisa; Davids, Rashieda; Mabhaudhi, Tafadzwanashe; Chimonyo, Michael; Slotow, Rob; Shankar, Bhavani; Häsler, Barbara","Journal of agriculture, food systems, and community development",https://doi.org/10.5304/jafscd.2020.094.021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32879750/,156

156597,Human Vaccines & Immunotherapeutics: news.,2021-05-04,"BACKGROUND Coronavirus patients demonstrate varying degrees of respiratory insufficiency; many will progress to respiratory failure with a severe version of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) refractory to traditional supportive strategies. Providers must consider alternative therapies to deter or prevent the cascade of decompensation to fulminant respiratory failure. METHODS This is a case-series of five COVID-19 positive patients who demonstrated severe hypoxemia, declining respiratory performance, and escalating oxygen requirements. Patients met the following criteria: COVID-19 positivity, worsening respiratory performance, severe hypoxemia (PaO2<80) despite traditional supportive measures, escalating supplemental oxygen requirements and D-dimer greater than 1.5μg/mL. All patients received protocol directed thrombolytic therapy with Tissue Plasminogen Activator (tPA). RESULTS All five patients improved without deleterious effects of thrombolytic therapy. Patient one was on maximum ventilator support, paralytics, and prone positioning without improvement. During tPA administration his P/F ratio improved from 69 to 127. Ventilator support was weaned immediately on post-treatment day 1 and he was extubated on post treatment day 12. Our second through fifth patients were not intubated at time of initiation of tPA therapy. These patients each required significant oxygen supplementation trending toward intubation. After tPA therapy, all patients demonstrated a noticeable increase in PaO2 values overtime. Three of these patients avoided intubation due to COVID-19 associated respiratory failure. CONCLUSIONS Administration of thrombolytics was followed by overall improvement in patients' oxygen requirements, and in three cases, prevented progression to mechanical ventilation, without deleterious effects. Clinical trials of thrombolytic therapy would further serve to underscore the efficacy and utility of this therapy.

Ten healthy subjects were tested. Electrodes were positioned over the midline (Oz, Iz, CBz) and at 3, 6 and 9 cm intervals lateral to the midline electrodes bilaterally. Additional electrodes were also positioned over posterior neck muscles (SPL1 and SPL2). The largest evoked potentials on average were recorded from the electrodes 3 and 6 cm lateral to the Iz and CBz midline locations. BC stimuli produced short latency potentials on the side contralateral to the stimulated mastoid and were dependent on stimulus polarity. Positive polarity stimuli produced biphasic VsCEPs at approximately 12 and 17 ms (P12-N17) for BC impulses and 10 and 15 ms (P10-N15) for BC 500 Hz stimuli. Following the initial excitation, there was a period of suppression of background activity lasting an average of 16.8 ms for positive polarity BC impulses. Negative polarity stimuli produced later VsCEPs both for BC impulses (P20-N26) and BC 500 Hz (P13-N18). VsCEPs to AC 500 Hz stimuli lateralised to the contralateral side and were larger for right than left ear stimulation. Stimulus polarity (condensation and rarefaction) did not alter the timing of the VsCEPs to AC 500 Hz tones. No evoked response was recorded to somatosensory (median and radial nerve) stimulation. Four patients with cerebellar disease were tested and two showed abnormal VsCEPs with initial negativities. VsCEPs show distinct mapping over the posterior fossa and are likely to reflect climbing fibre responses via crossed otolith-cerebellar pathways.","Govender, Sendhil; Todd, Neil P M; Colebatch, James G",Experimental brain research,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00221-020-05733-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32006077/,156

METHODS We performed a meta-analysis of existing data regarding pancreatic fistula following stapled pancreatic transection, comparing bare metal staples to reinforced staple loads. RESULTS We identified ten manuscripts between 2007 and 2009 reporting outcomes following stapled division of the pancreas (five retrospective reviews, five prospective case series). A total of 483 stapled pancreatic resections are included in this meta-analysis. Of these, 234(48 %) were reinforced (REINF) and 249 (52 %) were bare staples (STPL). Out of 483 cases, there were a total of 100 documented pancreatic leaks (21 %). Sixty-one leaks were reported out of 249 STPL divisions (24 %), while 39 leaks were reported following REINF division (17 %). The overall relative risk of developing a pancreatic fistula following distal pancreatectomy was not significantly different comparing STPL to REINF when all studies were combined (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.65-1.53). We further evaluated the data stratifying by study design (prospective or retrospective) and found that prospective studies reported a significantly higher risk of pancreatic fistula with STPL compared to REINF technique (RR 14.45, 95 % CI 3.15-66.21).

159714,A Mouse Model of Bilateral Cervical Contusion-Compression Spinal Cord Injury.,2017,"The cell surface receptor T cell immunoglobulin mucin domain 1 (TIM-1) dramatically enhances filovirus infection of epithelial cells. Here, we showed that key phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) binding residues of the TIM-1 IgV domain are critical for Ebola virus (EBOV) entry through direct interaction with PtdSer on the viral envelope. PtdSer liposomes but not phosphatidylcholine liposomes competed with TIM-1 for EBOV pseudovirion binding and transduction. Further, annexin V (AnxV) substituted for the TIM-1 IgV domain, supporting a PtdSer-dependent mechanism. Our findings suggest that TIM-1-dependent uptake of EBOV occurs by apoptotic mimicry. Additionally, TIM-1 enhanced infection of a wide range of enveloped viruses, including alphaviruses and a baculovirus. As further evidence of the critical role of enveloped-virion-associated PtdSer in TIM-1-mediated uptake, TIM-1 enhanced internalization of pseudovirions and virus-like proteins (VLPs) lacking a glycoprotein, providing evidence that TIM-1 and PtdSer-binding receptors can mediate virus uptake independent of a glycoprotein. These results provide evidence for a broad role of TIM-1 as a PtdSer-binding receptor that mediates enveloped-virus uptake. Utilization of PtdSer-binding receptors may explain the wide tropism of many of these viruses and provide new avenues for controlling their virulence.","Moller-Tank, Sven; Kondratowicz, Andrew S; Davey, Robert A; Rennert, Paul D; Maury, Wendy",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01025-13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23698310/,156
160568,The COVID-19 Vaccine Landscape.,2021,"INTRODUCTION Functional assessment of arterial load by dynamic arterial elastance (Eadyn), defined as the ratio between pulse pressure variation (PPV) and stroke volume variation (SVV), has recently been shown to predict the arterial pressure response to volume expansion (VE) in hypotensive, preload-dependent patients. However, because both SVV and PPV were obtained from pulse pressure analysis, a mathematical coupling factor could not be excluded. We therefore designed this study to confirm whether Eadyn, obtained from two independent signals, allows the prediction of arterial pressure response to VE in fluid-responsive patients. METHODS We analyzed the response of arterial pressure to an intravenous infusion of 500 ml of normal saline in 53 mechanically ventilated patients with acute circulatory failure and preserved preload dependence. Eadyn was calculated as the simultaneous ratio between PPV (obtained from an arterial line) and SVV (obtained by esophageal Doppler imaging). A total of 80 fluid challenges were performed (median, 1.5 per patient; interquartile range, 1 to 2). Patients were classified according to the increase in mean arterial pressure (MAP) after fluid administration in pressure responders (≥ 10%) and non-responders. RESULTS Thirty-three fluid challenges (41.2%) significantly increased MAP. At baseline, Eadyn was higher in pressure responders (1.04 ± 0.28 versus 0.60 ± 0.14; P < 0.0001). Preinfusion Eadyn was related to changes in MAP after fluid administration (R (2) = 0.60; P < 0.0001). At baseline, Eadyn predicted the arterial pressure increase to volume expansion (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.94; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.86 to 0.98; P < 0.0001). A preinfusion Eadyn value ≥ 0.73 (gray zone: 0.72 to 0.88) discriminated pressure responder patients with a sensitivity of 90.9% (95% CI: 75.6 to 98.1%) and a specificity of 91.5% (95% CI: 79.6 to 97.6%). CONCLUSIONS Functional assessment of arterial load by Eadyn, obtained from two independent signals, enabled the prediction of arterial pressure response to fluid administration in mechanically ventilated, preload-dependent patients with acute circulatory failure.","García, Manuel Ignacio Monge; Romero, Manuel Gracia; Cano, Anselmo Gil; Aya, Hollmann D; Rhodes, Andrew; Grounds, Robert Michael; Cecconi, Maurizio",Critical care,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13054-014-0626-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25407570/,156
161979,Human Vaccines & Immunotherapeutics: news.,2020-06-02,"Introduction For successful pulmonary segmentectomy, the identification of boundaries between segments is important. Previous measures include tracing the intersegmental vessels by staining with a dye via the affected pulmonary artery or bronchus and inflating with oxygen via a high frequency ventilator. However, problems with these methods have been reported. Aim We developed a novel method using a manual jet ventilator (MJV) and investigated its efficacy in identification of the pulmonary intersegmental plane. Material and methods Patients underwent MJV for pulmonary segmentectomy in the period from January 2013 to December 2017 at our institution. The patients' characteristics, resected segments, availability of clear resection planes, and complications associated with MJV from medical records were investigated. A questionnaire survey was conducted with the surgeons on the effectiveness of lung segment identification using MJV. Results Of 199 cases of planned pulmonary segmentectomy, 171 cases with descriptions of identified intersegmental planes were analyzed. Of these, 152 (89%) cases showed a clear boundary. There were 19 cases where the exact boundaries were not clearly identified, but segmentectomy was still performed. Furthermore, we found that identification of the right upper lobes was difficult (p = 0.0028). A subjective questionnaire was answered by the 12 surgeons who performed the procedures. All 12 responded that MJV was very effective or effective regarding clarity, safety, shorter identification time, and shorter resection time. Conclusions MJV enabled surgeons to more easily and safely identify the pulmonary intersegmental plane, thereby suggesting that MJV has clinical significance during pulmonary segmentectomy.","Taguchi, Shima; Saeki, Noboru; Morio, Atsushi; Nakamura, Ryuji; Kamiya, Satoshi; Ikeda, Tsuyoshi; Oshita, Kyoko; Hamada, Hiroshi; Miyata, Yoshihiro; Okada, Morihito; Tsutsumi, Yasuo M",Wideochirurgia i inne techniki maloinwazyjne = Videosurgery and other miniinvasive techniques,https://doi.org/10.5114/wiitm.2020.95919; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33786131/,156

183963,Identification of coronaviral conserved sequences and application to viral genome amplification.,1993,"There is a bidirectional association between hyperglycemia (HG) and COVID-19 severity. We conducted a retrospective cohort study in COVID-19 patients aged ≥18 years hospitalized at the Boston Medical Center during March 1 - August 4, 2020 with the aim to determine the relationships among HG, presence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and outcomes of COVID-19. Blood glucose levels (BG) measured on admission were extracted from the hospital database. HG was defined as BG >200 mg/dL. Patients with type 1 diabetes or BG <70 mg/dL were excluded. Outcomes were in-hospital death and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Multivariate analysis was used to determine the associations between exposures and outcomes. A total of 1,434 patients were included in the analysis. The mean ± SD age was 56 ± 17 years, 642 (45%) were female and 458 (32%) had a history of T2D. HG occurred in 193 patients with T2D (42%) and 42 patients without T2D (4%). The rates of death and ICU admission were 9% and 19%, respectively. Among patients without T2D, after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, race and comorbidities, patients with HG had a significantly higher odds of death (aOR 4.5, 95%CI 1.8 - 11.2) and ICU admission (aOR 3.7, 95%CI 1.8 - 7.5) than patients without HG. Among patients with T2D, patients with HG had a significantly higher odds of ICU admission (aOR 1.7, 95%CI 1.0 - 2.8) and tended to have a higher odds of death (aOR 1.6, 95%CI 0.8-3.0) than patients without HG after adjusting for potential confounders. Among the 235 patients with HG, the odds of death and ICU admission were higher in the 42 HG patients without T2D than the 193 patients with T2D (death: aOR 5.1, 95%CI 1.3 - 19.0;ICU admission: aOR 2.7, 95%CI 1.1 - 6.7) after adjusting for potential confounders including BG. HG in the subset of patients without T2D could be a marker of high inflammatory burden leading to higher mortality or undiagnosed diabetes leading to increased severity of COVID-19 due to metabolic dysfunction.","Charoenngam, Nipith Holick Michael F.; Apovian, Caroline",Diabetes,https://doi.org/10.2337/db21-181-lb,156

Taking into consideration that COVID-19 is harming the labor market and economic activity in general, we also consider that this situation is affecting the personal consumption expenditures in case of Kosovo (Ziberi, Rexha, & Gashi, 2021). The main aim of this paper is to analyze how the customers’ behavior will shift the traditional business to an online one in case of Western Balkan countries with special emphasis on Kosovo, North Macedonia and Albania. The study considered the mixed methods using the questionnaire as a method for primary data collection in a random sample of citizens from countries in the analysis. The questionnaire was distributed online using social media in a sample of 1250 respondents. The paper uses the SPSS software for data analysis and hypotheses testing. The study comes to the conclusion that buying behavior is changing due to the imposed measures by governance due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, the confidence in online shopping has increased significantly which is a good base for further recommendations for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to start reworking selling strategies and to shift their activity from purely traditional to hybrid one — traditional and online — promoting so better the traditional business. Our findings also are in line with a study by Bytyçi (2020) who stated that the consumers in case of the Republic of Kosovo prefer online shopping for one main reason — time loss reduction. © 2021 The Authors.","Bytyçi, S.; Shala, V.; Ziberi, B.; Myftaraj, E.",Journal of Governance and Regulation,https://doi.org/10.22495/jgrv10i2siart10,156
184337,Natural infection of nude mice with low-virulent mouse coronavirus.,1990,"Background: Tuberculosis preventive therapy (TPT) for latent TB infection has had limited success in Zimbabwe. The country plans to roll-out the three-month short-course TPT regimen (3HP) to address the implementation lag and poor uptake of the 6-9-month regimens. The study measured the level of organizational readiness while identifying barriers and facilitators to implement 3HP in four health facilities in Zimbabwe. Methods: A convergent, parallel mixed-methods approach was used to collect data from four primary healthcare clinics in Bulawayo and Harare Metropolitan provinces, Zimbabwe. Twenty healthcare providers completed a 35-item, self-administered questionnaire designed on a 5-point Likert scale and developed from the Weiner organizational readiness model. Nine of the providers and five TB program managers took part in 20-30 minute individual semi-structured key-informant interviews. Median scores with interquartile ranges were calculated wherein a score of 3.3 or greater indicated readiness. Differences between facilities were assessed using a Kruskal-Wallis rank test. Qualitative data on barriers and facilitators were transcribed and analyzed using a framework approach. Results: Readiness to implement 3HP across the four facilities was positive with a score of 3.8(IQR 3.3-4.1). The difference between the best 4.0(IQR 3.8-4.2) and worst performing facility 3.2(IQR 2.7-3.3) was 0.8 and statistically significant (p=0.039). The low facility score was due to poor contextual factors 2.5(IQR 2.0-3.3), task demands 2.6(IQR 2.3-2.9) and resource availability 2.1(IQR 1.5-2.5) scores. Key organizational readiness facilitators included healthcare provider and management buy-in; community willingness to generate demand for 3HP; strong collective capability through task-shifting, alignment with existing primary healthcare programs, perceived benefits, and need for 3HP. Barriers were negative past TPT experiences, suboptimal programmatic monitoring, inconsistent health provider remuneration, inadequate staffing, added workload, and an erratic supply chain across facilities. The organizational communication gap prompts the slow program implementation culture. Conclusions: The varied scores between facilities suggest distinct underlying conditions for readiness. Healthcare provider motivation is temporary based on the inconsistent resource supply, absence of TPT-specific monitoring and evaluation, and daily contextual challenges in facilities that must be addressed. Similar research is necessary for countries yet to implement 3HP to optimize the design or revision of delivery strategies and increase uptake of TPT.

The course was tightly focused on cell communication (Adv Physiol Educ 36: 13?19, 2012, Biochem Mol Biol Educ. 2013 May-Jun;41(3):145-55). The new version was offered synchronously on-line to 273 students who were in different time zones (within Canada and abroad, Africa, Asia). Didactic sessions (both flipped/non-flipped) were followed by TA sessions (60-90 mins.) designed to help students consolidate content and prepare them for active assessments used (The FASEB Journal, 31: 575.2-575.2.). Each tutorial Group had on the average, twenty students. For the tutorials, we met them in virtual break-out rooms where we had considerable flexibility to organize our sessions. Larger groups were reconvened to meet the instructors either on the same day or on a separate session. These sessions served to further consolidate their learning. In addition, we had the options of organizing office hours on our own to deal with our students. We were taking several of our own on-line courses in parallel. These dual obligations as teachers in one course and learners for several others posed many challenges. As teachers, we had to foster engagement, promote interactions, gauge comprehension, maintain enthusiasm, identify individual learning needs despite lack of verbal, non-verbal cues as many students remained both silent and invisible and also deal with technical glitches. To prepare for our own courses we faced similar technical issues, maintained enthusiasm, battled online fatigue, engaged with our Professors and TAs, dealt with conflicting schedules, found resources, remained flexible, and stayed focused as the lack of a distinct campus environment blurred boundaries between home and academia. We adapted rapidly to cope with these concurrent contrary demands.","Sadeghian, Shadi Kim Jinny Penn Jeremy Hass Dominic Hou Wenteng Ivanesivic Sofia Lavoie Declan Park Jung Wen Aaron Zarb Sophie Colautti Jake Ho Elaine Klitovchenko David Zarandi Auva",The FASEB Journal,https://doi.org/10.1096/fasebj.2021.35.s1.01540,156

Furthermore, we found similar associations between FTSE100 and volumetric measures of affective brain regions in a subsample (n=39,755; measurements performed over 5.5 years), which were particularly strong around phase transitions characterized by maximum volatility in the market. The main findings did not depend on applied effect-size estimation criteria (linear methods or mutual information criterion) and were replicated in two independent US-based studies (Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative; n=424; performed over 2,5 years and MyConnectome; n=1; 81 measurements over 1,5 years).

The sensor shows high sensitivity (Gauge factor∼3557.6 in the strain range from 0 to 48%), and outstanding stretchability up to the strain of 300%, which is capable of detecting different types of deformation of the human body. By integrating the high-performance sensor with a deep learning network, we demonstrate a high accuracy of respiration monitoring and emergency alarm system, showing the enormous application potential of the sensor in personal and public healthcare.","Liu, Zekun Li Zhenhong Zhai Heng Jin Lu Chen Kaili Yi Yangpeiqi Gao Yuan Xu Lulu Zheng Yan Yao Sirui Liu Zhangchi Li Gang Song Qingwen Yue Pengfei Xie Shengquan Li Yi Zheng Zijian",Chemical Engineering Journal,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2021.130869,156

METHODS With the case-control study, a standardized questionnaire was used for data collection in three general hospitals where nosocomial infection had occurred. Univariate analysis was done at first. All concerned factors about SARS infection were scanned by using Chi-square test and Fisher's exact test one by one, and determined as to whether they were risk factors or protective factors according to odd ratio (OR) score. Then, multivariate unconditional logistic regression analysis was used to re-analyze the picked-out factors for finding out which factors played independent roles. RESULTS Twenty-two factors (nineteen protective factors and three risk factors), among the total fifty-six factors, were significantly associated with SARS infection. Multivariate unconditional logistic regression revealed that factors such as double exposure suits (OR=0.053), education (OR=0.072), gloves (OR=0.102), hands sterilized by iodine (OR=0.231), room air ventilation (OR=0.32), were significantly protective; conversely, tracheal intubation (OR=30.793) was a significant risk factor. CONCLUSION Strict defense and antisepsis measures were pivotal in preventing SARS infection among high-risk medical personnel. Education about associated knowledge and effective air ventilation were also important factors.","Pei, Li-ying; Gao, Zhan-cheng; Yang, Zhen; Wei, Dong-guang; Wang, Shi-xin; Ji, Jian-min; Jiang, Bao-guo",Beijing da xue xue bao.

187907,An enteric coronavirus infection of cats and its relationship to feline infectious peritonitis.,1981,"There is no single accepted method to establish a causal relationship between an infective agent and its corresponding infectious disease. Different biomedical disciplines use a patchwork of distinct but overlapping approaches. To a greater or lesser extent these are based on criteria known as the Koch-Henle postulates, or 'Koch's postulates' for short. Deficiencies in Koch's postulates were recognized by their principal author shortly after their formulation. Now, over a century later, a more rigorous method to test causality has still to be finalized. One contender is a method that uses molecular methods to establish a causal relationship ('molecular Koch's postulates'). Recognizing the wider range of contemporary approaches used to build an argument for a causal relationship, the use of a more inclusive approach to establish proof of causality is proposed. This method uses an argument built from a series of assertions. Assertion 1: congruence or reproducible correlation of a taxonomically defined life form with the clinico-pathological and epidemiological features of infection. Assertion 2: consistency of the demonstrable biological response in the subject to an encounter with the prospective infective agent. Assertion 3: progressive or cumulative dissonance as an explanation for pathophysiological processes at every known level of biological organization in the subject. Assertion 4: curtailment of that pathophysiological process on the deliberate introduction of a specified biomedical intervention. Evidence to implicate the candidate biological entity as an initiator of or primer for cumulative dissonance places it in a subcategory of micro-organisms to be known as 'priobes'. A priobe is the sufficient and necessary antecedent cause of a pathophysiological process evident as an infectious disease.","Inglis, Timothy J J",Journal of medical microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17965339/,156

188249,Feline infectious peritonitis in servals (Felis serval).,1998,"Hydrophobic fusion peptides (FPs) are the most highly conserved regions of class I viral fusion-mediating glycoproteins (vFGPs). FPs often contain conserved glycine residues thought to be critical for forming structures that destabilize target membranes. Unexpectedly, a mutation of glycine residues in the FP of the fusion (F) protein from the paramyxovirus simian parainfluenza virus 5 (SV5) resulted in mutant F proteins with hyperactive fusion phenotypes (C. M. Horvath and R. A. Lamb, J. Virol. 66:2443-2455, 1992). Here, we constructed G3A and G7A mutations into the F proteins of SV5 (W3A and WR isolates), Newcastle disease virus (NDV), and human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3). All of the mutant F proteins, except NDV G7A, caused increased cell-cell fusion despite having slight to moderate reductions in cell surface expression compared to those of wild-type F proteins. The G3A and G7A mutations cause SV5 WR F, but not NDV F or HPIV3 F, to be triggered to cause fusion in the absence of coexpression of its homotypic receptor-binding protein hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN), suggesting that NDV and HPIV3 F have stricter requirements for homotypic HN for fusion activation. Dye transfer assays show that the G3A and G7A mutations decrease the energy required to activate F at a step in the fusion cascade preceding prehairpin intermediate formation and hemifusion. Conserved glycine residues in the FP of paramyxovirus F appear to have a primary role in regulating the activation of the metastable native form of F. Glycine residues in the FPs of other class I vFGPs may also regulate fusion activation.","Russell, Charles J; Jardetzky, Theodore S; Lamb, Robert A",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15564482/,156

Immune complex-induced tissue injury is mediated by inflammatory cell infiltration that is highly regulated by multiple chemokines. To assess the role of the chemokine receptors CCR1 and CCR5, and a ligand for these receptors CCL3/macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha, in this pathogenic process, the reverse passive cutaneous Arthus reaction was induced in mice lacking CCR1, CCR5, or CCL3. Edema was significantly attenuated in CCR1-deficient (CCR1(-/-)) and CCL3(-/-) mice but not CCR5(-/-) mice, compared with wild-type mice. Numbers of infiltrating neutrophils and mast cells were reduced in CCL3(-/-) and CCR1(-/-) mice, respectively, compared with wild-type mice. CCR1 and CCR5 were expressed on neutrophils and mast cells. Remarkably, the intradermal mRNA expression of CCL5/RANTES, another ligand for CCR1 and CCR5, was increased in CCR5(-/-) and CCL3(-/-) mice, compared with wild-type mice, while the cutaneous CCL3 mRNA expression was augmented in CCR1(-/-) and CCR5(-/-) mice. These results indicate that CCR1, CCR5, and CCL3 cooperatively contribute to the cutaneous Arthus reaction, and also suggest that enhanced expression of CCL3 and CCL5 compensates for the loss of CCR1, CCR5, and CCL3 in the reaction.","Yanaba, Koichi; Mukaida, Naofumi; Matsushima, Kouji; Murphy, Philip M; Takehara, Kazuhiko; Sato, Shinichi",European journal of immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15517609/,156

Two antisera directed against fusion proteins containing sequences encoded in portions of the 3'-terminal 2.0 kb of ORF 1b were used to immunoprecipitate p90, p74, p53, p44, and p32 polypeptides. These polypeptides were clearly different in electrophoretic mobility, antiserum reactivity, and partial protease digestion pattern from viral structural proteins and from polypeptides encoded in the 5' end of ORF 1a, previously identified by in vitro translation. The largest of these polypeptides had partial protease digestion patterns similar to those of polypeptides generated by in vitro translation of a synthetic mRNA derived from the 3' end of ORF 1b. The polypeptides encoded in ORF 1b accumulated more slowly during in vitro translation than polypeptides encoded in ORF 1a. This is consistent with the hypothesis that translation of gene A initiates at the 5' end of ORF 1a and that translation of ORF 1b occurs following a frameshift at the ORF 1a-ORF 1b junction. The use of in vitro translation of genome RNA and immunoprecipitation with antisera directed against various regions of the polypeptides encoded in gene A should make it possible to study synthesis and processing of the putative coronavirus polymerase.","Denison, M R; Zoltick, P W; Leibowitz, J L; Pachuk, C J; Weiss, S R",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2033667/,156

In most cases it can be resolved easily by traditional management techniques, but other cases can be very challenging. We enrolled 40 patients who failed traditional interventions and performed short-term high-pressure support ventilation (HPSV). Thirty-three (83%) patients were responsive to HPSV. In the responders, ten minute HPSV reduced mean airway pressure (P=0.030), minute ventilation (P <0.001), respiratory rate (P <0.001) and heart rate (P <0.001) compared to before HPSV therapy. It also stabilised tidal volume (P <0.001) and improved oxygenation (P=0.007). After 58 minutes, HPSV relieved tachypnoea. However, compared with the responders, the non-responders (7/40, 17%) were younger (77.0 versus 59.7 years, P=0.002), and had higher Glasgow Coma Scale score (9.0 versus 14.0, P <0.001), pressure support (P=0.029), peak pressure (P=0.048) and heart rate (P=0.004) before sudden-onset rapid breathing. The non-responders also had higher peak pressure (P=0.046), minute ventilation (P=0.024), respiratory rate (P=0.027) and heart rate (P <0.001) when the rapid breathing happened. At or before sudden-onset rapid breathing, peak pressure, minute ventilation and heart rate had a high accuracy to predict the non-responsive patients (each with area under the curve of ≥0.7). The age and Glasgow Coma Scale also had high predicted ability (both with areas under the curve of ≥0.8). In conclusion, short-term HPSV relieved persistent sudden-onset rapid breathing. However, it was not effective in the relatively young and conscious patients with relatively high support pressure, peak pressure, minute ventilation and heart rate.","Duan, J; Tang, X; Huang, S; Jia, J; Guo, S",Anaesthesia and intensive care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23194206/,156

Intestinal transplantation, as well as lifelong parenteral nutrition is associated with a 5-year survival rate of less than 50 %. We have already used allogeneic arterial segments to replace the upper airway in sheep. The results were encouraging with an induced transformation of the aortic wall into tracheo-bronchial bronchial-type tissue. METHODS Seven young mini-pigs were used. A 10-cm-diameter, allogeneic, aortic graft was interposed in an excluded small bowel segment and wrapped by the neighboring omentum. Animals were autopsied at 1 (n = 2), 3 (n = 3), and 6 months (n = 2), respectively. Specimens were examined macroscopically and microscopically. RESULTS The overall survival rate of the animals was 71.4 %. No anastomotic leak occurred. Histologic analysis revealed intestinal-like wall transformation of the aortic graft in the surviving animals. CONCLUSION Aortic-enteric anastomosis is feasible in a porcine model.

The satisfaction levels of all NA managers and RNs were acceptable. Based on the research findings, the implication and limitations of this study were discussed.","Lin, I-Chun; Hou, Ying-Hui; Huang, Hui-Ling; Chu, Tsui-Ping; Chang, Ray-E",Journal of medical systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20503619/,156

189453,Correlation between maternal serum antibodies and protection against bovine rotavirus diarrhea in calves.,2000,"BACKGROUND Distal landing zone accuracy is critical in some intracranial aneurysms treated with the Pipeline Embolization Device (PED), and delayed opening of the distal end of the device can complicate the procedure. Here, we report a technical nuance that facilitates accurate placement of the distal end of the PED by ex-vivo, pre-implantation release of the PED Flex polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) sleeves. TECHNICAL NOTE The PED Flex is partially pushed out of the introducer sheath ex-vivo, pre-implantation until the distal PED opens entirely and the PTFE sleeves are located distal to the device. Without inverting the PTFE sleeves, the PED is carefully pulled back into the introducer sheath placing the PTFE sleeves inside the device. The PED is loaded into the microcatheter and advanced toward the site of implantation. When the PED is initially deployed and pushed out of the microcatheter, it opens immediately and provides an anchor for the remainder of the deployment process. We present a video (supplementary material) that illustrates the technique along with an illustrative case. CONCLUSION Ex-vivo, pre-implantation release of the PTFE sleeves is an option in aneurysm treatment where distal landing accuracy is critical. Even without the protection of the PTFE sleeves, our clinical observation shows that the PED can be advanced safely through the microcatheter in selected cases.","Griessenauer, Christoph J; Gupta, Raghav; Moore, Justin; Thomas, Ajith J; Ogilvy, Christopher S","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27469135/,156
189499,Coronaviruses and their diseases.,1990,"Transmissible gastroenteritis virus of swine (TGEV), feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), and canine coronavirus were studied with respect to their serological cross-reactivity in homologous and heterologous virus neutralization, immune precipitation of radiolabeled TGEV, electroblotting, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using individual virion polypeptides prepared by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. TGEV was neutralized by feline anti-FIPV serum, and the reaction was potentiated by complement; heterologous neutralization involved antibody reacting with the peplomer protein (P), the envelope protein (E), and cellular (glycolipid) components incorporated into the TGEV membrane. Electrophoretic analysis of immune precipitates containing [35S]methionine-labeled disrupted TGEV and feline anti-FIPV antibody confirmed the reaction with the P and E polypeptides and showed the nucleocapsid protein (N) in addition. Electroblotting, followed by incubation with antibody, 125I-labeled protein A, and fluorography, disclosed cross-reactions between the three viruses at the N and E levels and revealed differences in the apparent molecular weights of the latter. Enzyme immunoassays performed with standard amounts of immobilized P, N, and E polypeptides of the three viruses showed recognition of the antigens by homologous and heterologous antibody to comparable degrees. These results indicate a close antigenic relationship between TGEV, FIPV, and canine coronavirus due to common determinants on the three major virion proteins. The taxonomic implications of these findings are discussed.","Horzinek, M C; Lutz, H; Pedersen, N C",Infection and immunity,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6182101/,156

An infection with M pneumoniae may precede the onset of asthma or exacerbate asthma symptoms. Chronic infection with M pneumoniae has been suspected to play a part in some patients with asthma. The role of immunoglobulin E-related hypersensitivity and induction of T helper type 2 immune response leading to inflammatory response in M pneumoniae-infected patients with asthma have also been proposed. Use of macrolides in reducing asthma symptoms only in M pneumoniae-infected patients supports the use of macrolides in patients with asthma having M pneumoniae infection. As macrolides are both antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory drugs, the therapeutic role of their biphasic nature in reducing asthma symptoms needs further attention in clinical research.","Nisar, Nazima; Guleria, Randeep; Kumar, Sanjay; Chand Chawla, Tirlok; Ranjan Biswas, Nihar",Postgraduate medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17308212/,156
190135,Indirect transmission of bovine viral diarrhoea virus at calving and during the postparturient period.,2004,"An immunohistochemistry technique was developed using fixed tissues to study the presence and location of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) antigens in situ. Experimentally infected gnotobiotic and conventional pigs as well as pigs with natural TGEV infection were examined. The staining technique was based on detection of the major structural protein of TGEV, the nucleocapsid, by using a pool of 3 monoclonal antibodies. Formalin and periodate-lysine-paraformaldehyde (PLP)-fixed intestinal tissues from a gnotobiotic pig inoculated with virulent TGEV were used to determine optimal antibody concentrations and incubation times. The intestinal tissues remained in their respective fixatives for 6 months, and serial sections were removed at sequential times and embedded in paraffin blocks. PLP and 10% neutral buffered formalin were acceptable fixatives and preserved TGEV nucleocapsid antigenicity for up to 6 months. Formalin, in comparison with PLP as a fixative, was better for preserving original tissue morphology and provided better antigen detection. Conventional crossbred pigs were inoculated with virulent TGEV, and animals were euthanized on various postexposure days. Intestinal tissues were positive for TGEV nucleocapsid antigens on postexposure days 2, 4, and 8. The immunohistochemistry technique detected TGEV antigen in stored paraffin-embedded tissues from 14 naturally infected pigs previously confirmed as positive for TGEV using a direct immunofluorescence assay on intestinal mucosal smears, whereas 9 naturally infected pigs confirmed negative for TGEV antigen by the same immunofluorescence assay showed no staining consistent with the presence of TGEV antigen. Immunohistochemistry provides a method to detect TGEV and possibly other closely related coronaviruses such as porcine respiratory coronavirus in situ. A diagnostic test using the same fixed tissues processed for histopathology provides veterinary practitioners an alternative to delivering live pigs or refrigerated fresh intestinal samples containing infectious virus to a diagnostic laboratory. Investigators can utilize this technique to retrospectively screen fixed tissues for TGEV antigen.","Shoup, D I; Swayne, D E; Jackwood, D J; Saif, L J","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8744736/,156
190223,Evaluation of ProMED-mail as an electronic early warning system for emerging animal diseases: 1996 to 2004.,2006,"Aging has been associated with a decline in immunocompetence and resistance to infections, partially due to dysregulated NO production by macrophages and deficits in mounting Th2 cell responses. We wondered if these alterations would reverse the immune response in experimental leishmaniasis. Bone-marrow-derived macrophages from 2- and 18-month-old (senescent) C57BL/6 or BALB/c mice showed no marked difference in leishmanicidal functions. In vivo infections of resistant C57BL/6 mice with Leishmania major revealed no difference between senescent and young mice. However, among susceptible BALB/c mice, senescent animals showed less foot-pad swelling than young mice, and 40 to 60% of them even showed healing of ulcers, reduced parasite dissemination, and a Th1 cell response. These changes were associated with a spontaneous release of interleukin-12 (IL-12) by macrophages from aged but not from young mice. Since exogenous microbial stimulation can influence immune responses during aging, we also infected senescent mice who were raised under specific-pathogen-free (SPF) conditions. They showed neither resistance nor a Th1 response, but their macrophages still spontaneously released IL-12. A microbiological analysis showed that conventionally kept mice, but not SPF mice, had experienced infection with murine hepatitis virus (MHV), an infection associated with a Th1-like response. We conclude that for the reversal of the immune response, senescence is the premier requirement but needs to be completed by another mandatory event such as microbial stimulation. One of the age-related, but not environment-related, factors is the spontaneous release of IL-12 by macrophages, while confrontation with MHV presents an environment-related difference, with both having the potential to support a Th1 response.","Ehrchen, Jan; Sindrilaru, Anca; Grabbe, Stephan; Schönlau, Frank; Schlesiger, Christian; Sorg, Clemens; Scharffetter-Kochanek, Karin; Sunderkötter, Cord",Infection and immunity,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15322004/,156
190376,Feline infectious peritonitis: a coronavirus disease of cats.,1978,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Computed tomography scans are commonly used in imaging lung diseases. As more information accumulates, patterns of rare or new diseases on CT scans are being increasingly reported. Several pulmonary diseases have distinguishing features, which are better delineated on high resolution CT scans than plain chest radiographs. The radiographic features of unusual diffuse lung diseases published in the past two years are described. RECENT FINDINGS Severe acute respiratory syndrome generally manifests as focal or diffuse bilateral areas of consolidation on chest radiography and reticulation with ground-glass attenuation commonly seen on CT scans. A normal HRCT rules out the diagnosis of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia while a normal chest radiograph does not. Immunocompromised patients without AIDS, who have CMV pneumonia, generally demonstrate a combination of ground-glass attenuation, air-space consolidation, and small nodules on HRCT. Nodules less than 10 mm in size in immunocompromised patients are highly suggestive of viral infections. Bronchial wall thickening on HRCT associated with cavitating nodules is suggestive of Wegner granulomatosis in the appropriate clinical setting. Small cysts may be seen in a minority of patients with subacute hypersensitivity pneumonitis and centrilobular emphysema in chronic farmer's lung. Reversed halo sign has a high specificity for cryptogenic organizing pneumonia. The triad of ground-glass opacities, ill-defined centrilobular nodules and cysts and focal areas of air trapping is highly suggestive of subacute hypersensitivity pneumonitis. SUMMARY Familiarizing with radiographic and CT scan patterns may help the clinician to exclude certain diagnoses and narrow the differential diagnosis for others.","Raoof, Sabiha; Raoof, Suhail; Naidich, David P",Current opinion in pulmonary medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15316437/,156
190627,Spread of a neurotropic coronavirus to spinal cord white matter via neurons and astrocytes.,1995,"This article presents an analysis of the correlates of HIV status among samples of injection drug users (IDUs) in Lang Son Province, Vietnam (n=348), and Ning Ming County, Guangxi Province, China (n=294), who were interviewed and tested for HIV antibody just before the start of a peer-based HIV prevention intervention in this border region. Participants were largely male, in their 20s, and single. Logistic regression analysis suggests that among Chinese IDUs, border-related factors (eg, living closer to the border, buying drugs across the border more frequently) and younger age are the best predictors of HIV positivity. In Vietnam, HIV status seems to drive behavior (eg, some risk reduction practices are predictive of HIV positivity). These differing patterns may reflect the fact that the intertwined epidemics of heroin injection and HIV began earlier and HIV prevalence has reached significantly higher levels in Lang Son than across the border in Ning Ming. Although border-related factors emerge as predictors in Ning Ming, more IDUs in Lang Son are HIV-positive and may be reacting behaviorally to that status. Their greater likelihood of engaging in risk reduction measures may reflect some combination of a belief that risk reduction can slow disease progression and an altruistic desire to avoid infecting others.","Hammett, Theodore M; Johnston, Patrick; Kling, Ryan; Liu, Wei; Ngu, Doan; Tung, Nguyen Duy; Binh, Kieu Thanh; Dong, Ha Viet; Hoang, Tran Vu; Van, Ly Kieu; Donghua, Meng; Chen, Yi; Des Jarlais, Don C",Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15671810/,156

191195,Attaching and effacing Escherichia coli infection as a cause of diarrhea in young calves.,1990,"Indirect molecular diagnosis of hemophiliaA (HA) is carried out by analyzing intragenic polymorphic markers described along the coagulation factorVIII (FVIII) gene. Several studies have demonstrated that the two commonly used intronic short tandem repeats (STR13 and STR22) located in the FVIII gene are highly informative for this task. Two extragenic markers closely linked to FVIII (DXS1073 and DXS1108) have also been described as valuable tools for gene tracking. The objective of the present work was to develop a rapid, single-tube automated method to simultaneously analyze these four STRs. Consistent amplification was achieved by quadruplex fluorescent PCR and the products were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis. Validation of the method included DNA analysis of 88 individuals from a control population, 45 HA patients and 32 individuals from 10 HA-affected families. Statistical study showed that the STR13, STR22 and DXS1108 loci were in significant linkage disequilibrium, whereas DXS1073 was not. Nevertheless, the combination of the four markers offered a high heterozygosity rate (>90%) that improved tracing of FVIII gene inheritance. Optimal results with application to single cells in a HA preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) protocol demonstrated the sensitivity of the technique. In conclusion, the automated fluorescent method described is an extremely rapid, simple and highly informative one that is easy to standardize and allows direct comparison of results among different groups working with genetic counseling, prenatal diagnosis and PGD in HA-affected families.","Sánchez-García, Jorge F; Gallardo, Dominique; Ramírez, Lorena; Vidal, Francisco",Thrombosis and haemostasis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16363255/,156
191414,Molecular analysis of the coronavirus-receptor function of aminopeptidase N.,1998,"OBJECTIVE Nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) are the collection modality of choice for reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) multiplex array for respiratory viruses. NPS gather both extracellular material and human respiratory epithelial cells and, when used with RT-PCR, have reliable sensitivity for detection of viral infection. GOALS At our institution, we identified a 1.7% re-order rate within 7-days for NPS destined for RT-PCR respiratory pathogen multiplex, which we hypothesize may be due in part to low confidence in adequate collection. We sought an inexpensive and accessible strategy for benchside quality assurance of NPS adequacy by observing microscopic content of viral transport media. PROCEDURE For eight-hundred one NPS samples collected during routine clinical practice in November 2019, aliquots of viral transport media were air-dried and safranin-stained on glass slides under a fume hood. We then counted morphologically distinct ciliated columnar epithelial cells (CCEs), which are prevalent in the nasopharynx. RESULTS Twenty percent of samples negative for respiratory pathogens by RT-PCR (BioFire FilmArray RP2, Cepheid GeneXpert) had no CCEs, while just seven percent of positive samples had no CCEs. Pearson's Chi-squared test was used to compare presence of CCEs between samples that were positive and negative for respiratory pathogens by RT-PCR (p=1.6×10-36). CONCLUSION We posit that samples without identifiable CCEs have a greater likelihood of inadequate collection. The basic, benchside protocol that we describe here demonstrates potential to reduce unnecessary re-testing when deployed to confirm negative tests despite high clinical suspicion: a strategy which may help conserve NPS reagents.","Matelski, Alexander; Siddique, Nikhut; Mead, Philip; Raimondi, Tommaso; Jorgenson, Laura C; Calderon, Omar; Harman, Kory; Farrell, John J",Annals of clinical and laboratory science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33067213/,156

OBJECTIVES To evaluate whether the pandemic has changed the prenatal care and pregnancy outcome in pregnant women without COVID-19. METHODS The authors conducted a cross-sectional study to describe changes in outpatient clinic visits and to compare the rates of cesarean and instrumental deliveries between two periods of time: March-April 2020 (during the COVID-19 outbreak) with March-April of the preceding year, 2019. RESULTS During the COVID-19 outbreak, visits to obstetric triage, gynecologic triage, high-risk clinic, and ultrasound units decreased by 36.4%, 34.7%, 32.8%, and 18.1%, respectively. The medical center experienced a 17.8% drop in the total number of births (610 births) compared with March and April 2019 (742 births). During the outbreak women were more likely to be nulliparous (33.3% vs. 27.6%, P = 0.02) and present with hypertensive disorders during pregnancy (7.5% vs. 4%, P = 0.005) or gestational diabetes (13% vs. 10%, P = 0.03). More epidural analgesia was used (83.1% vs. 77.1%, P = 0.006). There were more operative vaginal deliveries during the outbreak (16.7% vs. 6.8%, P = 0.01). All other maternal and neonatal outcomes were comparable between the two periods. CONCLUSIONS The medical facility experienced a major decline in all aspects of the routine obstetrics activities during the time of the pandemic. The higher rate of operative vaginal deliveries among nulliparous may be associated with the pandemic effect on the rate of high-risk patients.","Justman, Naftali; Shahak, Gilad; Gutzeit, Ola; Ben Zvi, Dikla; Ginsberg, Yuval; Solt, Ido; Vitner, Dana; Beloosesky, Ron; Weiner, Zeev; Zipori, Yaniv",The Israel Medical Association journal : IMAJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32954690/,156
191926,Association of diarrhea in cattle with torovirus infections on farms.,1991,"CTL escape mutations have been identified in several chronic infections, including mice infected with mouse hepatitis virus strain JHM. One outstanding question in understanding CTL escape is whether a CD8 T cell response to two or more immunodominant CTL epitopes would prevent CTL escape. Although CTL escape at multiple epitopes seems intuitively unlikely, CTL escape at multiple CD8 T cell epitopes has been documented in some chronically infected individual animals. To resolve this apparent contradiction, we engineered a recombinant variant of JHM that expressed the well-characterized gp33 epitope of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, an epitope with high functional avidity. The results show that the presence of a host response to this second epitope protected mice against CTL escape at the immunodominant JHM-specific CD8 T cell epitope, the persistence of infectious virus, and the development of clinical disease.","Kim, Taeg S; Perlman, Stanley",Journal of immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12902505/,156

It is characterized by the acute onset of diffuse, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates secondary to noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, refractory hypoxia, and decreased lung compliance. Acute respiratory distress syndrome occurs most frequently in the setting of sepsis, aspiration of gastric contents, trauma, or multiple transfusions. Its complex pathophysiology involves an inciting local or systemic event that initiates pulmonary endothelial and epithelial damage and subsequent increased permeability. Tachypnea, hypoxia, and respiratory alkalosis are typical early clinical manifestations, and they are usually followed by the appearance of diffuse pulmonary infiltrates and respiratory failure within 48 hours. Early identification and treatment of the underlying disorder, along with aggressive supportive care, are essential. Experimental therapies, including those using nitric oxide and surfactant, have not been shown to improve mortality in patients with ARDS, but new therapeutic approaches such as low-volume ventilation have been shown to decrease mortality. Many patients who survive ARDS have permanent, mild to moderate impairment of lung function. Quality of life after hospitalization with ARDS may be poorer than that in similar patients without ARDS.","Mortelliti, Michael P; Manning, Harold L",American family physician,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12018805/,156
192281,"Sequence analysis of CCV and its relationship to FIPV, TGEV and PRCV.",1993,"Infectious disease emergence is under the simultaneous influence of both genetic and ecological factors. Yet, we lack a general framework for linking ecological dynamics of infectious disease with underlying molecular and evolutionary change. As a model, we illustrate the linkage between ecological and evolutionary dynamics in rabies virus during its epidemic expansion into eastern and southern Ontario. We characterized the phylogeographic relationships among 83 isolates of fox rabies virus variant using nucleotide sequences from the glycoprotein-encoding glycoprotein gene. The fox rabies virus variant descended as an irregular wave with two arms invading from northern Ontario into southern Ontario over the 1980s and 1990s. Correlations between genetic and geographic distance suggest an isolation by distance population structure for the virus. The divergence among viral lineages since the most recent common ancestor correlates with position along the advancing wave front with more divergent lineages near the origin of the epidemic. Based on divergence from the most recent common ancestor, the regional population can be partitioned into two subpopulations, each corresponding to an arm of the advancing wave. Subpopulation A (southern Ontario) showed reduced isolation by distance relative to subpopulation B (eastern Ontario). The temporal dynamics of subpopulation A suggests that the subregional viral population may have undergone several smaller waves that reduced isolation by distance. The use of integrated approaches, such as the geographical analysis of sequence variants, coupled with information on spatial dynamics will become indispensable aids in understanding patterns of disease emergence.","Real, Leslie A; Henderson, J Caroline; Biek, Roman; Snaman, Jennifer; Jack, Tracy Lambert; Childs, James E; Stahl, Eli; Waller, Lance; Tinline, Rowland; Nadin-Davis, Susan",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16103358/,156
193015,Experimental inoculation of cats with canine coronavirus and subsequent challenge with feline infectious peritonitis virus.,1984,"OBJECTIVES As an alternative therapeutic approach for the prevention and treatment of bacterial infections with P. aeruginosa of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, chicken yolk antibodies (IgY) could be used. The most significant advantage of IgY, in contrast to mammalian IgG, consists in the fact, that when bound to the antigen, they usually do not induce inflammatory reaction. In addition, the simplicity of egg production and the ease of IgY preparation makes this kind of antibody an excellent tool for passive immunization. Thus, the aim of our project was to study the effect of IgY and its Fab fragment on the potential induction of pro-inflammatory reactions in lung epithelial cells. METHODS Chicken IgY were prepared from pooled egg yolks. Fab fragmens of IgY were purified from the papain digest of IgY using DEAE-Sephacel ion exchange chromatography. Their purity was verified by SDS electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gel. Immortalized human cell lines, CuFi (CF patient) and NuLi (healthy subject), and A549 (human adenocarcinoma cells) were exposed to IgY, Fab, OVA, LPS (positive control), PBS (negative control), and human and goat IgG for 24 hours. The concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and GM-CSF were determined in cell media using the BioPlex method, which enables the quantification of multiple analytes simultaneously in one sample. RESULTS Our results show that i) the Fab fragment induced levels of some proinflammatory cytokines, when compared to the PBS control, whereas ii) chicken IgYs did not induce any notable production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in contrast to intense effect of LPS on TNF-α and GM-CSF. In summary, our data show that levels of all cytokines are comparable with physiological values in human serum except of IL-1β, which concentration in cell medium was markedly elevated by Fab fragment. CONCLUSIONS The present data indicate that IgY are not inflammatory for lung cells and thus they are possibly applicable for prevention of airway bacterial infections.","Kubickova, Bozena; Majerova, Barbora; Hadrabova, Jana; Noskova, Libuse; Stiborova, Marie; Hodek, Petr",Neuro endocrinology letters,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25638373/,156

This disorder leads to an immunodeficiency caused by the absence of carbohydrate-based selectin ligands on the surface of neutrophils as well as to severe psychomotor and mental retardation. The fucosylation defect in LAD II fibroblasts can be corrected by addition of L-fucose to the culture medium. This prompted us to initiate dietary fucose therapy on a patient with LAD II.

194463,First description of Mycobacterium heckeshornense infection in a feline immunodeficiency virus-positive cat.,2013,"The aetiology of sarcoidosis is currently unknown. Due to the clinical and histological similarities between sarcoidosis and tuberculosis, the role of mycobacteria has been repeatedly investigated as an aetiological agent for sarcoidosis. The current meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the available molecular evidence on the possible role of mycobacteria in the development of sarcoidosis. The MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, DARE and CENTRAL databases were searched for relevant studies published from 1980 to 2006, and studies evaluating the presence of mycobacteria using molecular techniques in biological samples of patients with sarcoidosis were included in the current analysis. The 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for the expected proportion (of individual studies); the data was then pooled to obtain a summary success rate with 95% CI. The odds ratio (95% CI) was also calculated in order to assess the presence of mycobacteria in samples of patients with sarcoidosis versus those from nonsarcoidosis control samples. The database search yielded 31 studies. All studies used polymerase chain reaction for nucleic acid amplification followed by identification of nucleic acid sequences specific for different types of mycobacteria. Overall, 231 out of the 874 patients were positive for mycobacteria with a positive signal rate of 26.4 (23.6-29.5%), and the odds of finding mycobacteria in samples of patients with sarcoidosis versus controls were 9.67 (4.56-20.5%) using the random effects model and 19.49 (11.21-35.54%) using the exact method. There was methodological and statistical heterogeneity and evidence of publication bias. The results of the current study illustrate a demonstrable mycobacterial presence in sarcoidosis lesions suggesting an association between mycobacteria and some cases of sarcoidosis. To avoid methodological diversity, larger multicentre trials with a central laboratory for sample testing should be designed.","Gupta, D; Agarwal, R; Aggarwal, A N; Jindal, S K",The European respiratory journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17537780/,156

195227,Efficacy of an inactivated vaccine against clinical disease caused by canine coronavirus.,1995,"In the last decade, syndromic surveillance has increasingly been used worldwide for detecting increases or outbreaks of infectious diseases that might be missed by surveillance based on laboratory diagnoses and notifications by clinicians alone. There is, however, an ongoing debate about the feasibility of syndromic surveillance and its potential added value. Here we present our perspective on syndromic surveillance, based on the results of a retrospective analysis of syndromic data from six Dutch healthcare registries, covering 1999–2009 or part of this period. These registries had been designed for other purposes, but were evaluated for their potential use in signalling infectious disease dynamics and outbreaks. Our results show that syndromic surveillance clearly has added value in revealing the blind spots of traditional surveillance, in particular by detecting unusual, local outbreaks independently of diagnoses of specific pathogens, and by monitoring disease burden and virulence shifts of common pathogens. Therefore we recommend the use of syndromic surveillance for these applications.","van den Wijngaard, C C; van Pelt, W; Nagelkerke, N J; Kretzschmar, M; Koopmans, M P",Euro surveillance : bulletin Europeen sur les maladies transmissibles = European communicable disease bulletin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21392486/,156

195603,Effective prevention against rabies by intracerebral immunization in mice.,2009,"Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) infections cause great economic losses to the poultry industry worldwide. IBVs continuously evolve by developing mutations in antigenic sites; therefore, an IBV vaccine that provides broad cross-protection can be a highly relevant and practical method in IBV control strategies. Although some IBV vaccine strains are known to provide protection against multiple IBV serotypes, in general commercially available IBV vaccine strains provide protection against antigenically related viruses but not distinct heterologous viruses. In the present study we characterized the Korean variant IBV K40/09 strain with regard to its immunogenicity and protective efficacy against seven currently circulating IBV serotypes. Three-week-old specific-pathogen-free chickens were intraocularly immunized with the IBV K40/09 strain at 10(3.5) 50% egg infective dose (EID50). Three weeks after immunization all the birds were challenged with seven different strains at 10(4.5) EID50. Chickens immunized with the IBV K40/09 strain showed significantly high levels of protection against all challenge viruses at the trachea and kidney levels. Our results suggest that IBV K40/09 could be useful to ensure IBV vaccine effectiveness owing to its cross-protective ability. Therefore, the IBV K40/09 strain merits consideration as a vaccine candidate to prevent infection as well as the spread of new IBV strains and many IBV variants that have been reported worldwide.","Kim, Byoung-Yoon; Lee, Dong-Hun; Jang, Jun-Hyuk; Lim, Tae-Hyun; Choi, Soo-Won; Youn, Ha-Na; Park, Jae-Keun; Lee, Joong-Bok; Park, Seung-Yong; Choi, In-Soo; Song, Chang-Seon",Avian diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24283135/,156

The RT-LAMP assay is very simple and rapid, wherein the amplification can be obtained in 30 min under isothermal conditions at 63 degrees C by employing a set of four serotype-specific primer mixtures through real-time monitoring in an inexpensive turbidimeter. The evaluation of the RT-LAMP assay for use for clinical diagnosis with a limited number of patient serum samples, confirmed to be infected with each serotype, revealed a higher sensitivity by picking up 100% samples as positive, whereas 87% and 81% of the samples were positive by reverse transcription-PCR and virus isolation, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the RT-LAMP assay for the detection of viral RNA in patient serum samples with reference to virus isolation were 100% and 93%, respectively. The optimal assay conditions with zero background and no cross-reaction with other closely related members of the Flavivirus family (Japanese encephalitis, West Nile, and St. Louis encephalitis viruses) as well as within the four serotypes of dengue virus were established. None of the serum samples from healthy individuals screened in this study showed any cross-reaction with the four dengue virus serotype-specific RT-LAMP assay primers. These findings demonstrate that RT-LAMP assay has the potential clinical application for detection and differentiation of dengue virus serotypes, especially in developing countries.","Parida, Manmohan; Horioke, Kouhei; Ishida, Hiroyuki; Dash, Paban Kumar; Saxena, Parag; Jana, Asha Mukul; Islam, Mohammed Alimul; Inoue, Shingo; Hosaka, Norimitsu; Morita, Kouichi",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15956414/,156
195835,Enhancement of passive immunity with maternal vaccine against newborn calf diarrhea.,1997,"Vaccines against viral disease have traditionally relied on attenuated virus strains or inactivation of infectious virus. Subunit vaccines based on viral proteins expressed in heterologous systems have been effective for some pathogens, but have often suffered from poor immunogenicity due to incorrect protein folding or modification. In this review we focus on a specific class of viral subunit vaccine that mimics the overall structure of virus particles and thus preserves the native antigenic conformation of the immunogenic proteins. These virus-like particles (VLPs) have been produced for a wide range of taxonomically and structurally distinct viruses, and have unique advantages in terms of safety and immunogenicity over previous approaches. With new VLP vaccines for papillomavirus beginning to reach the marketplace we argue that this technology has now 'come-of-age' and must be considered a viable vaccine strategy.","Roy, Polly; Noad, Rob",Human vaccines,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18438104/,156
195853,Feline infectious peritonitis.,1981,"OBJECTIVE To determine the prevalence of microsporidiosis in HIV-infected patients with and without diarrhoea and to characterize alterations in mucosal architecture and brush border enzyme activities in patients with microsporidiosis. PATIENTS A total of 259 HIV-infected patients undergoing oesophago-gastroduodenoscopy because of diarrhoea (n = 123) or other symptoms (n = 136) were studied. METHODS Patients were evaluated for the presence of microsporidia by electron microscopy of duodenal biopsies. Brush border enzyme activities were measured by histochemistry and mucosal architecture was determined by three-dimensional morphometry in biopsies from patients with microsporidiosis and compared with biopsies from a subgroup of HIV-infected patients with or without other enteropathogens. RESULTS Enterocytozoon bieneusi was detected in 17 patients and Encephalitozoon intestinalis was detected in two patients. Microsporidiosis was significantly more frequent in patients with chronic diarrhoea (19.1%; P < 0.0001) or in patients with acute diarrhoea (7.2%; P = 0.04) than in patients without diarrhoea (1.5%). Microsporidiosis was associated with lactase deficiency (P = 0.03) and a reduced activity of alkaline phosphatase (P = 0.028) and alpha-glucosidase (P = 0.025) at the basal part of the villus compared with brush border enzymes in patients without enteropathogens. Patients with microsporidia had reduced villus height (P = 0.043) and a villus surface reduced by 40% (P = 0.004) compared with patients with enteropathogens other than microsporidia. CONCLUSIONS Our study confirms the association between microsporidia and diarrhoea. The pathophysiologic mechanism by which microsporidia cause diarrhoea appears in part to be malabsorption, caused by a reduction of absorptive mucosal surface and impairment of enterocyte function.","Schmidt, W; Schneider, T; Heise, W; Schulzke, J D; Weinke, T; Ignatius, R; Owen, R L; Zeitz, M; Riecken, E O; Ullrich, R",AIDS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9365763/,156
195914,Structural characterization of IBV glycoproteins.,1984,"Antisense oligonucleotides are recognized to be very efficient tools for the inhibition of gene expression in a sequence specific way. For the discovery of a novel efficient way to modify oligonucleotides, a series of single isonucleotide-incorporated antisense oligodeoxynucleotides have been synthesized, in which an isonucleotide was introduced at different positions of the sequences. The binding behaviors of modified oligodeoxynucleotides to the complementary sequence were studied by UV, CD, and molecular dynamics simulation. The results showed that although the incorporated isonucleotides at certain positions of the sequence interfere with the binding ability to a different extent, B-form duplexes were maintained and the binding abilities of the 3'-end-modified duplexes were better than the corresponding mismatched duplexes. The digestion of modified oligodeoxynucleotides by snake venom phosphodiesterase showed that an isonucleotide strongly antagonizes hydrolysis. The DNA/RNA hybrid formed by a modified oligodeoxynucleotide and its target RNA could activate RNase H. The 3'-end-modified antisense oligodeoxynucelotides inhibited S-glycoprotein expression of SARS-CoV at the mRNA levels in insect Sf9 cells. This study indicated the possibility of designing a novel and effective antisense oligodeoxynucleotide by incorporating an isonucleotide at the 3'-end of the sequence.","Wang, Zhanli; Shi, Jifeng; Jin, Hongwei; Zhang, Liangren; Lu, Jingfeng; Zhang, Lihe",Bioconjugate chemistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16173783/,156

A helpdesk service was established with the goal of providing immediate emotional and communication support to relatives while severe acute respiratory syndrome patients were isolated during the acute phase of the illness. AIM This study describes the results of a rapid assessment of the effectiveness of a helpdesk service designed to meet the immediate needs of relatives of severe acute respiratory syndrome patients in Hong Kong. DESIGN Survey. METHOD Eighty-three respondents, representing about 46.3% of relatives (179), attending the helpdesk on the day of the study were recruited. Service evaluation data was collected using a self-administered questionnaire completed by respondents. RESULTS Nearly 100% of respondents who used the service found the delivery service with on-site counselling useful for alleviating their anxiety. However, about half of these relatives complained of insufficient information regarding the patient's condition and progress. The majority of respondents were satisfied with the service. In describing the most important traits of the service providers, caring and enthusiasm were mentioned most frequently by respondents who stated that they were very satisfied with the service. CONCLUSION The results support the value of the service, and demonstrate that the service is effective in meeting relatives' immediate needs. These needs include information, aid in fulfilling their role as caretaker for the patient (delivering prepared soup) and psychological support. The results suggest that facilitation of visitation of patients by relatives via video conferencing and education of the public on the nature and course of severe acute respiratory syndrome to reduce the social stigma of having a potentially life-threatening disease should be introduced in Hong Kong.

The SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has been identified as the etiological agent for SARS. Thus, vaccination against SARS-CoV may represent an effective approach to controlling SARS. DNA vaccines are an attractive approach for SARS vaccine development, as they offer many advantages over conventional vaccines, including stability, simplicity, and safety. Our investigators have previously shown that DNA vaccination with antigen linked to calreticulin (CRT) dramatically enhances major histocompatibility complex class I presentation of linked antigen to CD8(+) T cells. In this study, we have employed this CRT-based enhancement strategy to create effective DNA vaccines using SARS-CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein as a target antigen. Vaccination with naked CRT/N DNA generated the most potent N-specific humoral and T-cell-mediated immune responses in vaccinated C57BL/6 mice among all of the DNA constructs tested. Furthermore, mice vaccinated with CRT/N DNA were capable of significantly reducing the titer of challenging vaccinia virus expressing the N protein of the SARS virus. These results show that a DNA vaccine encoding CRT linked to a SARS-CoV antigen is capable of generating strong N-specific humoral and cellular immunity and may potentially be useful for control of infection with SARS-CoV.","Kim, Tae Woo; Lee, Jin Hyup; Hung, Chien-Fu; Peng, Shiwen; Roden, Richard; Wang, Mei-Cheng; Viscidi, Raphael; Tsai, Ya-Chea; He, Liangmei; Chen, Pei-Jer; Boyd, David A K; Wu, T-C",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15078946/,156

It has been shown that atypical pneumonia (AP), with similar clinical features to SARS, has been identified in Guangzhou, China, long before the prevalence of SARS, a fact that urges further understanding of SARS in regard to its incidence and variable clinical courses, for its differential diagnosis with such diseases as AP, influenza-related pneumonia, pulmonary tuberculosis, fungal and cytomegalovirus pneumonia. Information sharing among the medical institutes and training of the first-line medical staff for their better understanding and awareness of SARS and AP is crucial in the clinical practice, to insure timely case identification and avoid ""oversensitive"" diagnosis.

Both of the sgRNA promoters were characterized previously and their secondary structures predicted by computer analysis [J. Wang and A. E. Simon (1997). Virology 232, 174-186]. Secondary structure-sensitive chemical and enzymatic probes have now been used to determine the structure of the promoter directing synthesis of the 1.45-kb sgRNA, namely the 1.45-kb sgRNA promoter, in solution. The newly obtained structure conforms with the previously predicted hairpin structure except for the hairpin base: four CG base pairs and a CA bulge are present instead of an A bulge. Studies of deletions within the 96-nucleotide (nt) 1.45-kb sgRNA promoter defined a minimal 30-nt core sequence as essential for promoter activity: a 21-nt hairpin and a 9-nt flanking single-stranded sequence. Mutational analysis in the stem section of the core promoter supported a role for the primary sequence and secondary structure in promoter activity. Sequence alterations in the flanking single-stranded region further suggest that the sequence CCCAUUA, encompassing the transcription start site, is required for efficient transcription of the 1.45-kb sgRNA by the TCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase in vivo.","Wang, J; Carpenter, C D; Simon, A E",Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9918891/,156

Strand-specific reverse transcription-PCR analysis of viral RNA isolated from transfected BHK-21 cells revealed that this region is required for negative-strand genomic RNA synthesis. The 34-nucleotide stretch is highly conserved among PRRSV isolates and folds into a putative hairpin. A 7-base sequence within the loop of this structure was suggested to base-pair with a sequence present in the loop of a hairpin located in the 3' noncoding region, resulting in a kissing interaction.

198378,Molecular evolution of corona- and toroviruses.,1999,"Background COVID-19 has affected both adults and children with variable presentations and disease severity. Children can present with mild symptoms of fever, cough and shortness of breath, and rapidly progress to severe pneumonia, requiring mechanical ventilation. This population includes children who are younger than one year and older adolescents who have an underlying comorbidity-specifically immunosuppression or prior cardio-respiratory infections. In this review, we discuss the determinants of severe disease among the paediatric patients- primarily asthma, immune-status, obesity and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). Asthma and underlying lung pathologies can be a strong predictor (~20% prevalence) for development of severe COVID-19 infection, irrespective of age. However, as compared to asthma, a higher mortality rate was reported in immune-compromised patients. With a weakened immune system, immunosuppressed individuals were 1.55 times and immunocompromised patients 3.29 times more vulnerable to developing severer COVID-19 disease. Similarly, evidence suggests that a BMI of greater than 35 kg/m2 renders individuals more susceptible to developing COVID-19-related complications. This observation is based on the negative impacts obesity has on pulmonary functions and in downplaying the immune system. Furthermore, a possible association of COVID-19 and MIS-C has been reported by multiple studies across the globe but it needs further studies to strengthen its stance due to the scarcity of data when compared with the other determinants discussed in this article. Authors recommend researchers directing attention on synthesizing the evolving evidence to fill the knowledge void in the paediatric population, which will better enable paediatricians to make informed decisions.","Qamar, Mohammad Aadil; Sajid, Mir Ibrahim; Dhillon, Rubaid Azhar; Irfan, Omar; Abaidullah, Sajid","Journal of Ayub Medical College, Abbottabad : JAMC",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33754534/,156

MATERIALS AND METHODS By using reagent kits produced by Central Research Institute of Epidemiology for the detection of primary causative agents of influenza and ARVI 129 children and 94 adult patients monitored in an outpatient setting as well as 103 children hospitalized due to ARI were examined. RESULTS Etiological structure of ARVI was studied; proportion of influenza and other actual causative agents of ARVI in monthly dynamics were established. During epidemic rise of influenza (January-March 2011) the proportion of influenza A viruses was 24% (peak in January--31%), the proportion of influenza B viruses--5%, rhinoviruses--9%, metapneumovirus was detected in 6% of cases, parainfluenza viruses (1 - 4 type) and adenovirses--4% each, coronaviruses--in 3%, respiratory syncytial virus--in 2%, bocavirus--in 1% of the studied samples. In influenza structure A/H1N1pdm2009 virus, its proportion was 70%, influenza virus B (26.9%), influenza virus A/H3N2 (2.6%) predominated. Indexes for monthly morbidity caused by each of the ARVI causative agents were calculated. CONCLUSION The proposed approach allowed to evaluate ARVI morbidity taking into account laboratory-confirmed etiological factors. A 5 time increase in ARI morbidity in adults in February 2011 was shown to be mostly due to an increase in influenza A morbidity as well as involvement of influenza B virus, metapneumoviruses, coronaviruses, parainfluenza viruses and rhinoviruses into the epidemic process. Increase of morbidity of children by 1.4 times was also seen during activization of influenza viruses and metapneumovirus. The analysis of monitoring results allowed to prognose increase of respiratory-syncytial viral infection epidemic activity from September 2011 to February 2012.","Iatsyshina, S B; Konovalov, A V; Magkoeva, Z G; Praded, M N; Shelkovskaia, L P; Perevozchikova, L A; Andronova, M M; Gorelov, A V","Zhurnal mikrobiologii, epidemiologii, i immunobiologii",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23805649/,156

METHODS: An online national survey of adolescents and young adults (n = 4,351) aged 13-24 years was conducted in May 2020. Multivariable logistic regression assessed relationships among COVID-19-related symptoms, testing, and diagnosis and cigarettes only, e-cigarettes only and dual use, sociodemographic factors, obesity, and complying with shelter-in-place. RESULTS: COVID-19 diagnosis was five times more likely among ever-users of e-cigarettes only (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.82-13.96), seven times more likely among ever-dual-users (95% CI: 1.98-24.55), and 6.8 times more likely among past 30-day dual-users (95% CI: 2.40-19.55). Testing was nine times more likely among past 30-day dual-users (95% CI: 5.43-15.47) and 2.6 times more likely among past 30-day e-cigarette only users (95% CI: 1.33-4.87). Symptoms were 4.7 times more likely among past 30-day dual-users (95% CI: 3.07-7.16). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is associated with youth use of e-cigarettes only and dual use of e-cigarettes and cigarettes, suggesting the need for screening and education.","Gaiha, Shivani Mathur; Cheng, Jing; Halpern-Felsher, Bonnie",J Adolesc Health,,156

The proposed model can be easily implemented with daily updated data sets of the pandemic publicly available by distinct online sources. It has only two adjustable parameters and it predicts the evolution of the total number of infected people in a country for the next 14 days if parameters do not change during the analyzed period. The model incorporates the main aspects of the disease such as the fact that there are asymptomatic and symptomatic phases (both capable of propagating the virus), and that these phases take almost two weeks before the infected person status evolves to the next (asymptomatic becomes symptomatic or symptomatic becomes either recovered or dead). A striking advantage of the model for its implementation by the health sector is that it gives directly the number of total infected people in each day (in thousands, tens of thousands or hundred of thousands). Here, the model is tested with data from Brazil, UK and South Korea, presenting low error rates on the prediction of the evolution of the disease in all analyzed countries. We hope this model may be a useful tool to estimate the propagation of the disease.","Curado, Evaldo M F; Curado, Marco R",PLoS One,,156

Other molecular imaging methods may be needed for evaluation of this malignancy. As ILC is nearly always (95%) estrogen receptor (ER) positive, ER-targeting PET tracers such as 16&#945;-[18F]-fluoroestradiol ([18F]FES) may have value. We reviewed prospective trials at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) utilizing [18F]FES PET/CT to evaluate metastatic ILC patients with synchronous [18F]FDG and [18F]FES PET/CT imaging, which allowed a head-to-head comparison of these two PET tracers. Methods: Six prospective clinical trials utilizing [18F]FES PET/CT in patients with metastatic breast cancer were performed at MSK from 2008-2019. These trials included 92 patients, of which 14 (15%) were of ILC histology. Seven of 14 patients with ILC had an [18F]FDG PET/CT performed within 5 weeks of the research [18F]FES PET/CT and no intervening change in management. For these 7 patients, the [18F]FES and [18F]FDG PET/CT studies were analyzed to determine the total number of tracer avid lesions, organ systems of involvement, and SUVmax of each organ system for both tracers. Results: In the seven comparable pairs of scans, there were a total of 254 [18F]FES-avid lesions (SUVmax 2.6 to 17.9) and 111 [18F]FDG-avid lesions (SUVmax 3.3 to 9.9) suspicious for malignancy. For 5 of 7 (71%) of ILC patients, [18F]FES PET/CT detected more metastatic lesions than [18F]FDG PET/CT. In the same 5 of 7 patients, the SUVmax of [18F]FES-avid lesions was greater than the SUVmax of [18F]FDG-avid lesions. One patient had [18F]FES avid metastases with no corresponding [18F]FDG avid metastases. There were no patients with [18F]FDG avid distant metastases without [18F]FES avid distant metastases, although in one patient liver metastases were evident on [18F]FDG but not [18F]FES PET. Conclusion: [18F]FES PET/CT compared favorably with [18F]FDG PET/CT for detection of metastases in patients with metastatic ILC. Larger prospective trials of [18F]FES PET/CT in ILC should be considered to evaluate ER-targeted imaging for clinical value in patients with this histology of breast cancer.","Ulaner, Gary A; Jhaveri, Komal; Chardarlapaty, Sarat; Hatzoglou, Vaios; Riedl, Christopher; Lewis, Jason S; Mauguen, Andrey",J. nucl. med,,156

With approximately 20 million new cases globally per year, cancer affects a substantial portion of the population. Individuals affected by cancer are more susceptible to infections owing to coexisting chronic diseases (cardiovascular, pulmonary, and diabetes), overall poor health status, and systemic immunosuppressive states caused by both cancer and the anticancer treatment. As a consequence, patients with malignancies, especially those with lung cancer who develop coronavirus disease 2019, experience more difficult outcomes. A recent multicenter study carried out by the Hubei Anti-Cancer Association has also documented that patients with lung cancer had an increased risk of death, intensive care unit requirement, risk of presenting severe or critical symptoms, and use of invasive mechanical ventilation.

Here we show that SIRPA decreased in vitro infection by a number of pathogenic viruses, including New World and Old World arenaviruses, Zika virus, vesicular stomatitis virus and pseudoviruses bearing the Machupo virus, Ebola virus and SARS-CoV-2 glycoproteins, but not HSV-1, MLV or mNoV. Moreover, mice with targeted mutation of the Sirpa gene that renders it non-functional were more susceptible to infection with the New World arenaviruses Junín virus vaccine strain Candid 1 and Tacaribe virus, but not MLV or mNoV. All SIRPA-inhibited viruses have in common the requirement for trafficking to a low pH endosomal compartment. This was clearly demonstrated with SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, which was only inhibited by SIRPA in cells in which it required trafficking to the endosome. Similar to its role in phagocytosis inhibition, SIRPA decreased virus internalization but not binding to cell surface receptors. We also found that increasing SIRPA levels via treatment with IL-4 led to even greater anti-viral activity. These data suggest that enhancing SIRPA's activity could be a target for anti-viral therapies.","Sarute, Nicolás; Cheng, Han; Yan, Zhonghao; Salas-Briceno, Karen; Richner, Justin; Rong, Lijun; Ross, Susan R",PLoS Pathog,,156

This interest has grown rapidly during the current COVID-19 pandemic, where CRISPR-diagnostics have been frontline contenders for rapid testing solutions. This surge in CRISPR-diagnostic research prompts the following question: what exactly are the achievable limits of detection and associated assay times enabled by the kinetics of enzymes such as Cas12 and Cas13? To explore this question, we here present a model based on Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics theory applied to CRISPR enzymes. We use the model to develop analytical solutions for reaction kinetics and develop back-of-the-envelope criteria to validate and check for consistency in reported enzyme kinetic parameters. We applied our analyses to all studies known to us, which report Michaelis-Menten-type kinetic data for CRISPR-associated enzymes. These studies include all subtypes of Cas12 and Cas13 and orthologs. We found all but one study clearly violate at least two of our three rules and therefore present data that violate basic physical limits. We performed an experimental study of reaction kinetics of LbCas12a with both ssDNA and dsDNA activators and use these data to validate our model and its predicted scaling. The validated model is used to explore CRISPR reaction time scales and the degree of reaction completion for practically relevant target concentrations applicable to CRISPR-diagnostic assays. The results have broad implications for achievable limits of detection and assay times of emerging, amplification-free CRISPR-detection methods.","Ramachandran, Ashwin; Santiago, Juan G",Anal Chem,,156

Multiple logistic analysis revealed that students living in urban (OR=1.409, 95% CI: 1.152 - 1.724, p=0.001) and those studying health-related courses (OR=1.581, 95% CI: 1.291 - 1.935, p<0.001) were more likely to have a positive attitude toward COVID-19 vaccines. In addition, those who were worried about being infected with COVID-19 (very much vs no, OR=1.690, 95% CI: 1.212-2.356, p=0.002), heard previously about COVID-19 vaccines (OR=1.659, 95% CI: 1.268-2.170, p<0.001), believed that vaccines are safe (Yes vs No, OR=3.570, 95% CI: 1.825-6.980), thought that vaccines can protect people from being infected with COVID-19 (Yes vs No, OR=1.957, 95% CI: 1.286-2.979, p=0.002), and had encouraged their family and friends to have a vaccine (Yes vs No, OR=17.745, 95% CI: 12.271-25.660, p<0.001) had higher acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination. Conclusions: A high rate of acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines was found among Chinese college students. However, vaccine uptake may be reduced by concerns about vaccine safety and efficacy. Alleviating these concerns and enhancing public confidence in vaccines are crucial for future immunization programs against the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bai, Wei; Cai, Hong; Liu, Shou; Liu, Huanzhong; Qi, Han; Chen, Xu; Liu, Rui; Cheung, Teris; Su, Zhaohui; Ng, Chee H; Xiang, Yu-Tao",Int J Biol Sci,,156
426130,Can the COVID-19 Pandemic Disrupt the Current Drug Development Practices?,2021,"BACKGROUND: Digital health technologies can be key to improving health outcomes, provided health care workers are adequately trained to use these technologies. There have been efforts to identify digital competencies for different health care worker groups; however, an overview of these efforts has yet to be consolidated and analyzed. OBJECTIVE: The review aims to identify and study existing digital health competency frameworks for health care workers and provide recommendations for future digital health training initiatives and framework development. METHODS: A literature search was performed to collate digital health competency frameworks published from 2000. A total of 6 databases including gray literature sources such as OpenGrey, ResearchGate, Google Scholar, Google, and websites of relevant associations were searched in November 2019. Screening and data extraction were performed in parallel by the reviewers. The included evidence is narratively described in terms of characteristics, evolution, and structural composition of frameworks. A thematic analysis was also performed to identify common themes across the included frameworks. RESULTS: In total, 30 frameworks were included in this review, a majority of which aimed at nurses, originated from high-income countries, were published since 2016, and were developed via literature reviews, followed by expert consultations. The thematic analysis uncovered 28 digital health competency domains across the included frameworks. The most prevalent domains pertained to basic information technology literacy, health information management, digital communication, ethical, legal, or regulatory requirements, and data privacy and security. The Health Information Technology Competencies framework was found to be the most comprehensive framework, as it presented 21 out of the 28 identified domains, had the highest number of competencies, and targeted a wide variety of health care workers. CONCLUSIONS: Digital health training initiatives should focus on competencies relevant to a particular health care worker group, role, level of seniority, and setting. The findings from this review can inform and guide digital health training initiatives. The most prevalent competency domains identified represent essential interprofessional competencies to be incorporated into health care workers' training. Digital health frameworks should be regularly updated with novel digital health technologies, be applicable to low- and middle-income countries, and include overlooked health care worker groups such as allied health professionals.","Nazeha, Nuraini; Pavagadhi, Deepali; Kyaw, Bhone Myint; Car, Josip; Jimenez, Geronimo; Tudor Car, Lorainne",J Med Internet Res,,156
436140,Subarachnoid diverticulum associated with feline infectious peritonitis in a Siberian cat,2020,"BACKGROUND: To investigate intention rates to get vaccinated against COVID-19 among healthcare personnel (HCP) in Greece. METHODS: Cross-sectional survey. RESULTS: The response rate was 14.5%. Of 1521 HCP with a known profession, 607 (39.9%) were nursing personnel, 480 (31.6%) physicians, 171 (11.2%) paramedical personnel, 72 (4.7%) supportive personnel, and 191 (12.6%) administrative personnel. Overall, 803 of 1571 HCP (51.1%) stated their intention to get vaccinated while 768 (48.9%) stated their intention to decline vaccination. Most HCP (71.3%) who reported intent to get vaccinated noted contributing to the control of the pandemic and protecting their families and themselves as their reasons, while the most common reason for reporting intent to decline vaccination was inadequate information about the vaccines (74.9%), followed by concerns about vaccine safety (36.2%). Logistic regression analysis revealed that the probability of intending to get vaccinated increased with male gender, being a physician, history of complete vaccination against hepatitis B, history of vaccination against pandemic A (H1N1) in 2009-2010, belief that COVID-19 vaccination should be mandatory for HCP, and increased confidence in vaccines in general during the COVID-19 pandemic. The following factors were associated with a lower intention to get vaccinated: no vaccination against influenza the past season, no intention to get vaccinated against influenza in 2020-2021, and no intention to recommend COVID-19 vaccination to high-risk patients. CONCLUSION: There is an urgent need to built safety perception towards COVID-19 vaccines and raise vaccine uptake rates by HCP, and thus to protect the healthcare workforce and the healthcare services.","Maltezou, Helena C; Pavli, Androula; Dedoukou, Xanthi; Georgakopoulou, Theano; Raftopoulos, Vasilios; Drositis, Ioannis; Bolikas, Emmanouil; Ledda, Caterina; Adamis, Georgios; Spyrou, Andronikos; Karantoni, Eleni; Gamaletsou, Maria N; Koukou, Dimitra Maria; Lourida, Athanasia; Moussas, Nikolaos; Petrakis, Vasilios; Panagopoulos, Periklis; Hatzigeorgiou, Dimitrios; Theodoridou, Maria; Lazanas, Marios; Gargalianos, Panagiotis; Sipsas, Nikolaos V",Infect Dis Health,,156
437971,SSnet: A Deep Learning Approach for Protein-Ligand Interaction Prediction,2021,"National and international guidelines recommend droplet/airborne transmission and contact precautions for those caring for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients in ambulatory and acute care settings. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, an acute respiratory infectious agent, is primarily transmitted between people through respiratory droplets and contact routes. A recognized key to transmission of COVID-19, and droplet infections generally, is the dispersion of bioaerosols from the patient. Increased risk of transmission has been associated with aerosol generating procedures that include endotracheal intubation, bronchoscopy, open suctioning, administration of nebulized treatment, manual ventilation before intubation, turning the patient to the prone position, disconnecting the patient from the ventilator, noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation, tracheostomy, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The knowledge that COVID-19 subjects can be asymptomatic and still shed virus, producing infectious droplets during breathing, suggests that health care workers (HCWs) should assume every patient is potentially infectious during this pandemic. Taking actions to reduce risk of transmission to HCWs is, therefore, a vital consideration for safe delivery of all medical aerosols. Guidelines for use of personal protective equipment (glove, gowns, masks, shield, and/or powered air purifying respiratory) during high-risk procedures are essential and should be considered for use with lower risk procedures such as administration of uncontaminated medical aerosols. Bioaerosols generated by infected patients are a major source of transmission for SARS CoV-2, and other infectious agents. In contrast, therapeutic aerosols do not add to the risk of disease transmission unless contaminated by patients or HCWs.","Fink, James B; Ehrmann, Stephan; Li, Jie; Dailey, Patricia; McKiernan, Paul; Darquenne, Chantal; Martin, Andrew R; Rothen-Rutishauser, Barbara; Kuehl, Philip J; Häussermann, Sabine; MacLoughlin, Ronan; Smaldone, Gerald C; Muellinger, Bernhard; Corcoran, Timothy E; Dhand, Rajiv",J. aerosol med. pulm. drug deliv,,156

461209,Spinal cord injury and COVID-19: some thoughts after the first wave,2020,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has reach pandemic proportions globally. For patients with symptoms of fever and cough accompanied by rapid lung damage progression, COVID-19 needs to be distinguished from interstitial lung disease (ILD) attributed to connective tissue disease (CTD), especially dermatomyositis (DM)/clinical amyopathic dermatomyositis (CADM) associated rapidly progressive interstitial lung disease (RP-ILD). CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a woman observed with fever, cough, and rapid lung damage during the epidemic. The patient had a suspicious epidemiological history, and her chest CT scans showed lung damage similar to that caused by COVID-19, but anti-Ro52 antibody was strongly positive. She was diagnosed with CADM associated RP-ILD and died 1 month later. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 epidemic, it is critical to carefully assess patients with CTD related ILD, especially RP-ILD associated with CADM. Repeated nucleic acid tests for COVID-19 are necessary to achieve accurate case diagnosis. High-resolution CT (HRCT) of the chest is presently deemed an inefficient technique to distinguishing between COVID-19 and CADM associated RP-ILD. The characteristic rashes of dermatomyositis require careful observation and can often provide diagnostic clues. For patients with CADM, a high titers of anti-Ro52 antibody may be related to the pathogenesis of RP-ILD, suggesting a poor prognosis.","Cao, Mengke; Zhang, Shuangshuang; Chu, Dejie; Xiao, Ming; Liu, Xiaohong; Yu, Lingling; Li, Jing; Huang, Yi; Fang, Fang",BMC Pulm Med,,156

Artificial intelligence has been tried to help clinicians in improving the diagnostic accuracy and working efficiency of CT. Whereas, existing supervised approaches on CT image of COVID-19 pneumonia require voxel-based annotations for training, which take a lot of time and effort. This paper proposed a weakly-supervised method for COVID-19 lesion localization based on generative adversarial network (GAN) with image-level labels only. We first introduced a GAN-based framework to generate normal-looking CT slices from CT slices with COVID-19 lesions. We then developed a novel feature match strategy to improve the reality of generated images by guiding the generator to capture the complex texture of chest CT images. Finally, the localization map of lesions can be easily obtained by subtracting the output image from its corresponding input image. By adding a classifier branch to the GAN-based framework to classify localization maps, we can further develop a diagnosis system with improved classification accuracy. Three CT datasets from hospitals of Sao Paulo, Italian Society of Medical and Interventional Radiology, and China Medical University about COVID-19 were collected in this article for evaluation. Our weakly supervised learning method obtained AUC of 0.883, dice coefficient of 0.575, accuracy of 0.884, sensitivity of 0.647, specificity of 0.929, and F1-score of 0.640, which exceeded other widely used weakly supervised object localization methods by a significant margin. We also compared the proposed method with fully supervised learning methods in COVID-19 lesion segmentation task, the proposed weakly supervised method still leads to a competitive result with dice coefficient of 0.575. Furthermore, we also analyzed the association between illness severity and visual score, we found that the common severity cohort had the largest sample size as well as the highest visual score which suggests our method can help rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 patients, especially in massive common severity cohort. In conclusion, we proposed this novel method can serve as an accurate and efficient tool to alleviate the bottleneck of expert annotation cost and advance the progress of computer-aided COVID-19 diagnosis.","Yang, Ziduo; Zhao, Lu; Wu, Shuyu; Chen, Calvin Yu-Chian",IEEE J Biomed Health Inform,,156

The objective of this review is to examine the adaptations of psychiatric care in France during this pandemic. METHOD: This narrative review is based on the observation of changes made in French psychiatric hospitals and on an analysis of the literature. RESULTS: Regarding psychiatric hospitalization, the COVID-19 epidemic required rapid measures that profoundly modified the conditions of patients' reception, forcing the medical staffs to adapt their methods of care. The authors noted the creation of at least 89 wards specifically dedicated to patients with COVID-19 needing psychiatric hospitalization, allowing dual care of general medicine and psychiatry. Regarding ambulatory care, maintaining patients with long-term follow-up was a priority. Patients recalling and teleconsultation have been precious resources but cannot entirely replace face-to-face consultations. DISCUSSION: COVID-19 epidemic created unprecedented situation of large-scale upheavals in the healthcare system and in society.

The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on urology surgical waiting list in a high-volume hospital. Methods An observational descriptive study was designed. All patients included in the urology surgical waiting list of our high-volume center on May 1st 2020 (46 days after the suspension of elective surgery) were analyzed. Baseline variables, priority on the waiting list, main urological disease, type of scheduled surgery, and waiting time were recorded. Other variables recorded were the presence of a urinary catheter, number of accesses to the emergency department, evidence of COVID-19 infection, number of deaths and their cause. The waiting time for each disease was compared with the time to surgery in 2019. Results A total of 350 patients were included. The mean (SD) time on the waiting list was 97.33 (55.47) days. Priority 1 patients, who normally should undergo surgery within 30 days, were on the waiting list for a mean (SD) time of 60.51 (20.14) days. They were mainly patients with ureteral lithiasis (25.6%), high-risk or muscle-invasive bladder cancer (20.9%) and high-risk prostate cancer (13.9%). The mean waiting time had already significantly exceeded the mean time to surgery in 2019 for radical cystectomy (p = 0.04) and URS (p = 0.003).

ABCD guidelines on prevention and management,2009-07-31,"Rheum australe (Himalayan Rhubarb) is a multipurpose, endemic and endangered medicinal herb of North Western Himalayas. It finds extensive use as a medicinal herb since antiquity in different traditional systems of medicine to cure a wide range of ailments related to the circulatory, digestive, endocrine, respiratory and skeletal systems as well as to treat various infectious diseases. The remedying properties of this plant species are ascribed to a set of diverse bioactive secondary metabolite constituents, particularly anthraquinones (emodin, chrysophanol, physcion, aloe-emodin and rhein) and stilbenoids (piceatannol, resveratrol), besides dietary flavonoids known for their putative health benefits. Recent studies demonstrate the pharmacological efficacy of some of these metabolites and/or their derivatives as lead molecules for the treatment of various human diseases. Present review comprehensively covers the literature available on R. australe from 1980 to early 2018. The review provides up-to-date information available on its botany for easy identification of the plant, and origin and historical perspective detailing its trade and commerce. Distribution, therapeutic potential in relation to traditional uses and pharmacology, phytochemistry and general biosynthesis of major chemical constituents are also discussed. Additionally, efficient and reproducible in vitro propagation studies holding vital significance in preserving the natural germplasm of the plant and for its industrial exploitation have also been highlighted.

592634,RE-MuSiC: a tool for multiple sequence alignment with regular expression constraints,2007-05-08,"In the United States, schools closed in March 2020 due to COVID-19 and have begun reopening as of August 2020, despite continuing transmission of SARS-CoV-2. To determine the impact of school reopening with varying levels of operating capacity and face-mask adherence, we used an agent-based model calibrated to and validated against multiple data types from the state of Indiana, USA. In our model, transmission can occur in schools, workplaces, community settings, and households, all of which are structured in a realistic way according to state geography and demography. Using this model, we quantified the burden of COVID-19 on K-12 students, teachers, their families, and the general population under alternative scenarios about school reopening. In our primary analysis, we considered three levels of school operating capacity (50%, 75%, and 100%) and three assumptions about face-mask adherence in schools (50%, 75%, and 100%). Under a scenario in which schools operate remotely, we projected 45,579 (95% CrI: 14,109-132,546) infections and 790 (95% CrI: 176-1680) deaths between August 24 and December 31. Reopening at 100% capacity with 50% face-mask adherence in schools resulted in a proportional increase of 42.9 (95% CrI: 41.3-44.3) times that number of infections and 9.2 (95% CrI: 8.9-9.5) times that number of deaths. In contrast, operating at 50% capacity with 100% face-mask adherence resulted in only an 11% (95% CrI: 5%-18%) increase in the number of infections compared to the scenario in which schools operate remotely. We conclude that reduced capacity and high face-mask adherence in schools substantially reduce the burden of COVID-19, both among those with direct ties to schools and across the state. As Indiana and other states proceed with school reopening, our results illustrate quantitatively the benefits of safety measures that schools are undertaking, underscoring their value for both schools and their communities.","Espana, Guido; Cavany, Sean; Oidtman, Rachel J; Barbera, Carly; Costello, Alan; Lerch, Anita; Poterek, Marya; Tran, Quan; Wieler, Annaliese; Moore, Sean M; Perkins, Alex",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.22.20179960v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.22.20179960,156
593434,Efficacy and safety of the nucleoside analog GS-441524 for treatment of cats with naturally occurring feline infectious peritonitis,2019-02-13,"COVID-19, a novel coronavirus-related illness, has spread worldwide. Patients with apparently mild/moderate symptoms can suddenly develop severe pneumonia. Therefore, almost all COVID-19 patients require hospitalization, which can reduce limited medical resources in addition to overwhelming medical facilities. To identify predictive markers for the development of severe pneumonia, a comprehensive analysis of serum chemokines and cytokines was conducted using serial serum samples from COVID-19 patients. The expression profiles were analyzed along the time axis. Serum samples of common diseases were enrolled from a BioBank to confirm the usefulness of predictive markers. Five factors, IFN-λ3, IL-6, IP-10, CXCL9, and CCL17, were identified as predicting the onset of severe/critical symptoms. The factors were classified into two categories. Category A included IFN-λ3, IL-6, IP-10, and CXCL9, and their values surged and decreased rapidly before the onset of severe pneumonia. Category B included CCL17, which provided complete separation between the mild/moderate and the severe/critical groups at an early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The five markers provided a high predictive value (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC): 0.9-1.0, p < 0.001). Low expression of CCL17 was specifically observed in pre-severe COVID-19 patients compared with other common diseases, and the predictive ability of CCL17 was confirmed in validation samples of COVID-19. The factors identified could be promising prognostic markers to distinguish between mild/moderate and severe/critical patients, enabling triage at an early phase of infection, thus avoiding overwhelming medical facilities.","Sugiyama, Masaya; Kinoshita, Noriko; Ide, Satoshi; Nomoto, Hidetoshi; Nakamoto, Takato; Saito, Sho; Ishikane, Masahiro; Kutsuna, Satoshi; Hayakawa, Kayoko; Hashimoto, Masao; Suzuki, Manabu; Izumi, Shinyu; Hojo, Masayuki; Tsuchiya, Kiyoto; Gatanaga, Hiroyuki; Takasaki, Jin; Usami, Masahide; Kano, Toshikazu; Yanai, Hidekatsu; Nishida, Nao; Kanto, Tatsuya; Sugiyama, Haruhito; Ohmagari, Norio; Mizokami, Masashi",Gene,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32941953/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378111920308143?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2020.145145; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378111920308143,156
594191,Field strain feline coronaviruses with small deletions in ORF7b associated with both enteric infection and feline infectious peritonitis,2008-11-13,"Abstract Infection with coronavirus results in the accumulation of genomic-sized mRNA and six to eight subgenomic mRNAs that make up a 3′ coterminal nested-set structure. Genome-length negative-strand RNA and subgenomic-length negative-strand RNAs, each of which corresponds to each of the subgenomic mRNAs, also accumulate in infected cells. The present study examined whether the genome-length negative-strand RNA serves as a template for subgenomic mRNA synthesis. Genome-length replicative intermediate (RI) RNA was purified by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of intracellular RNAs from cells infected with mouse hepatitis virus. RNase A treatment of the purified genome-length RI resulted in the production of the genome-length replicative form RNA, indicating that the genome-length RI included genome-length template RNA. RNase protection assays using the purified genome-length RI and two probes, which corresponded to the 5′ 300-nt region of mRNA 6 and to the same region of mRNA 7, showed the presence of nascent leader sequence-containing subgenomic mRNAs in the genome-length RI.

596614,Myeloma-related disorder with leukaemic progression in a cat,2010-10-30,"Introduction Les conséquences de la COVID-19 sur la résistance aux antibiotiques sont encore peu documentées en France. Nous avons comparé la proportion de souches d’E. coli producteur de bêta-lactamase à spectre étendu (E. coli-BLSE) dans les prélèvements cliniques réalisés en soins communautaires et en Ehpad en France avant et après le confinement lors de la 1re vague de COVID-19. Matériels et méthodes Les antibiogrammes d’E. coli réalisés sur les prélèvements cliniques analysés par les laboratoires privés de 11 régions françaises participant au réseau de surveillance ont été inclus entre le 01/01/2019 et le 31/12/2020. Les données démographiques des patients ont également été comparées. Le taux de BLSE a été calculé en divisant le nombre d’E. coli-BLSE par le nombre total de souche d’E. coli. Les taux avant et après la phase de confinement ont été comparés par analyse univariée après stratification par sexe, âge, type de prélèvement et localisation géographique. Une analyse de série chronologique interrompue a été effectuée pour évaluer les modifications de tendance de taux d’E. coli-BLSE avant, pendant et après le confinement général de la population en mars 2020 en France. Résultats Les laboratoires participants ont transmis 535 843 antibiogrammes d’E. coli, dont 18 901 réalisés en Ehpad. Les souches analysées provenaient à 99,3% de prélèvements urinaires. En soins primaires, la proportion de E.coli-BLSE était de 3,2% (mini-maxi mensuels: 2,9 %–3,4 %) avant mars 2020 et 3,0 % (2 %–3,2 %) à partir de mai 2010 (p <0,001). Avant mars 2020, le taux de E. coli-BLSE progressait lentement (augmentation de 0,0005 %/mois). Une diminution significative du nombre de prélèvements positifs à E.coli était observé pendant le confinement comparativement à la même période en 2019 (−15,2%, p<0,001). À partir du 11 mai 2020, le taux d’E. coli-BLSE diminuait de 0,03 %/mois. Cette décroissance amorcée après le confinement s’est maintenue jusqu’à la fin de l’année. Des différences significatives entre les deux périodes étaient par ailleurs constatées chez les femmes (2,7 % vs 2,5 %, p <0,01), chez les 40–64 ans (2,7 % vs 2,5 %, p <0,01) et dans l’Est de la France (3,1 % vs 2,7 %, p =0,02). En Ehpad, la proportion d’E. coli-BLSE était de 10 % (mini-maxi mensuels : 8,2 %–12,0 %) avant mars 2020 et de 8,9 % (7,6 %–9,7 %) après mai 2020 (p <0,001). Avant mars 2020, le taux d’E. coli-BLSE évoluait à la baisse (−0,08%/mois). Ce taux de décroissance ralentissait à–0,04 %/mois à partir du mois de mai 2020. Dans cette population, il était constaté des différences significatives entre les deux périodes pour les individus de la tranche d’âge 85–94 ans (10,0 % vs 8,7%, p =0,03) et dans la région Ouest (7,5 % vs 5,4 %, p <0,01). Conclusion Ces résultats suggèrent de potentiels impacts de la pandémie de COVID-19 sur l’épidémiologie des E. coli-BLSE en France. Des modifications de comportement de prescription d’antibiotiques, de brassage de population et de maîtrise des infections pourraient expliquer ces modifications observées et nécessitent d’être explorés.","Lemenand, O.; Coeffic, T.; Thibaut, S.; Caillon, J.; Birgand, G.",Infectious Diseases Now,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666991921001299; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666991921001299,156

This manuscript describes a nanoscale diagnostic PCR workflow for sample preparation, amplification, and analysis of target pathogen sequences, focusing on procedures that are different from microliter scale reactions. In the respiratory panel presented, 18 assays were each set up in triplicate, accommodating up to 48 samples per plate. A universal extraction and pre-amplification workflow was optimized for high-throughput sample preparation to accommodate multiple matrices and DNA and RNA based pathogens. Representative data are presented for one RNA target (influenza A matrix) and one DNA target (equine herpesvirus 1). The ability to quickly and accurately test for a comprehensive, syndrome-based group of pathogens is a valuable tool for improving efficiency and ergonomics of diagnostic testing and for acute respiratory disease diagnosis and management.","Goodman, Laura B.; Anderson, Renee R.; Slater, Marcia; Ortenberg, Elen; Renshaw, Randall W.; Chilson, Brittany D.; Laverack, Melissa A.; Beeby, John S.; Dubovi, Edward J.; Glaser, Amy L.",J Vis Exp,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27929456/; https://doi.org/10.3791/54781,156

Funding support plays a critical role in facilitating scholarship within the field. Our objectives were to evaluate who is receiving funding from the NIH for topics relevant to voice disorders, and further describe temporal trends in grants awarded. METHODS: The NIH RePORTER database was searched for grants relevant to voice disorders. Data were further organized by PI specialty, academic department, and funding totals. Furthermore, PI scholarly impact, as measured by the h-index, was calculated. RESULTS: A total of 830 funded fiscal years (for 232 unique projects) totaling $203 million have supported projects examining voice disorders. A plurality of projects (32.8%) was awarded to PIs in otolaryngology departments, followed by 17.2% to speech pathology/communication sciences departments. Although year-to-year variation was noted, otolaryngology departments received approximately 15% of funding annually. Funded otolaryngologists had similar scholarly impact values to individuals in other specialties. CONCLUSIONS: The study of voice disorders involves an interdisciplinary approach, as PIs in numerous specialties receive NIH funding support. As they receive a considerable proportion of this funding and had similar h-indices compared to other specialties involved, otolaryngologists have just as much scholarly impact despite being a smaller specialty. As speech and language pathologists also comprised a significant proportion of individuals in this analysis, enhanced cooperation and encouragement of interdisciplinary scholarly initiatives may be beneficial.","Schwartz, Scott J.; Svider, Peter F.; Shah, Priyanka; Zuliani, Giancarlo; Eloy, Jean Anderson; Setzen, Michael; Folbe, Adam J.",Am J Otolaryngol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196070914002531; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196070914002531; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjoto.2014.10.026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25459319/,156

The antigen-binding region of such homodimeric heavy-chain only antibodies consists of one single domain, called VHH. VHHs provide many advantages over conventional full-sized antibodies and currently used antibody-based fragments (Fab, scFv), including high specificity, stability and solubility, and small size, allowing them to recognize unusual antigenic sites and deeply penetrate tissues. Since their discovery, VHHs have been used extensively in diagnostics and therapy. In recent decades, the number of outbreaks of diseases transmissible from animals to humans has been on the rise. In this review, we evaluate the status of VHHs as diagnostic and therapeutic biomolecular agents for the detection and treatment of zoonotic diseases, such as bacterial, parasitic, and viral zoonosis. VHHs show great adaptability to inhibit or neutralize pathogenic agents for the creation of multifunctional VHH-based diagnostic and therapeutic molecules against zoonotic diseases.","Lafaye, Pierre; Li, Tengfei",Comp Immunol Microbiol Infect Dis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147957118300729; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30396425/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cimid.2018.09.009; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0147957118300729,156

In order to comprehensively compare them, their genome sequencing data were examined by principal component analysis. Variations in coronavirus were smaller than those in a subclass of the influenza virus. In addition, differences among coronaviruses in a variety of hosts were small. These characteristics may have facilitated the infection of different hosts. Although many of the coronaviruses were more conservative, those repeatedly found among humans showed annual changes. If SARS-CoV-2 changes its genome like the Influenza H type, it will repeatedly spread every few years. In addition, the coronavirus family has many other candidates for subsequent pandemics.

599686,Feline immunodeficiency. ABCD guidelines on prevention and management,2009-07-31,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is common in intensive care units (ICUs), although it is associated with high mortality, no effective pharmacological treatments are currently available. Despite being poorly understood, the role of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1) axis in ARDS may provide significant insights into the immunosuppressive mechanisms that occur after ARDS. In the present study, we observed that the level of soluble PD-L1 (sPD-L1), a potential activator of the PD-1 pathway, was upregulated in survivors of direct ARDS than in non-survivors. Administration of sPD-L1 in mice with direct ARDS relieved inflammatory lung injury and improved the survival rate, indicating the protective role of sPD-L1 in direct ARDS. Using high-throughput mass cytometry, we found a marked decrease in the number of lung monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) with proinflammatory markers, and the protective role of sPD-L1 diminished in ARDS mice with monocyte/macrophage depletion. Furthermore, PD-1 expression increased in the MDMs of patients and mice with direct ARDS. Finally, we showed that sPD-L1 induced MDM apoptosis in patients with direct ARDS. Taken together, our results demonstrated that the engagement of sPD-L1 on PD-1 expressing macrophages resulted in a decrease in pro-inflammatory macrophages and eventually improved direct ARDS. Our study identified a prognostic indicator for patients with direct ARDS and a potential target for therapeutic development in direct ARDS.","Xu, Jing; Wang, Jiahui; Wang, Xiaoli; Tan, Ruoming; Qi, Xiaoling; Liu, Zhaojun; Qu, Hongping; Pan, Tingting; Zhan, Qingyuan; Zuo, Yong; Yang, Wen; Liu, Jialin",Cell Death Dis,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-020-03139-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33127884/,156
600974,Light and Ultrastructural Pathologic Changes in Intestinal Coronavirus Infection of Newborn Calves,2010-05-13,"Contaminated surfaces and indoor environments are important sources of infectious spread within hospital and non-hospital facilities. Bacterial infections such as infections with Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difficile (C. difficile) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and its antibiotic resistant strains continue to pose a significant risk to healthcare workers and patients. Additionally, the recent emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which is caused by the novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), highlights the need for safe and effective methods to decontaminate surfaces to control infection spread in hospitals and the community. To address these critical needs, we tested a photocatalytic reactor decontamination method to disinfect contaminated surfaces in a hospital and a laboratory setting. By placing the reactor in a test hospital room, growth of S. aureus and C. difficile were significantly reduced compared with a control room. Additionally, using a model enveloped positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus, dengue virus type 2 (DENV2), we showed that the use of the photocatalytic reactor reduces viral infectivity. Collectively, the results demonstrate the potential utility of photocatalytic reactors in reducing the spread of highly contagious bacterial and viral infections through contaminated surfaces and environments.","Gharaibeh, Abeer; Smith, Richard H.; Conway, Michael J.",Infect Dis Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33440699/; https://doi.org/10.3390/idr13010008,156

Molecular testing occurring now identifies the presence of the virus at the sampling site: nasopharynx, nares, or oral cavity. RNA sequencing has the potential to establish both the presence of the virus and define the host response in COVID-19. Methods Single center, prospective study of patients with COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit where deep RNA sequencing (>100 million reads) of peripheral blood with computational biology analysis was done. All patients had positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR. Clinical data was prospectively collected. Results We enrolled fifteen patients at a single hospital. Patients were critically ill with a mortality of 47% and 67% were on a ventilator. All the patients had the SARS-CoV-2 RNA identified in the blood in addition to RNA from other viruses, bacteria, and archaea. The expression of many immune modulating genes, including PD-L1 and PD-L2, were significantly different in patients who died from COVID-19. Some proteins were influenced by alternative transcription and splicing events, as seen in HLA-C, HLA-E, NRP1 and NRP2. Entropy calculated from alternative RNA splicing and transcription start/end predicted mortality in these patients. Conclusions Current upper respiratory tract testing for COVID-19 only determines if the virus is present. Deep RNA sequencing with appropriate computational biology may provide important prognostic information and point to therapeutic foci to be precisely targeted in future studies.","Monaghan, S.

603900,Feline leucocyte antigen class II polymorphism and susceptibility to feline infectious peritonitis,2004-02-25,"BACKGROUND: The nasal avian schistosome Trichobilharzia regenti spends part of its intravertebrate period of life within the central nervous system. Migration of the parasites can be accompanied by neuromotor disorders or paralysis in natural definitive hosts (ducks) and even in laboratory mammals. Cercariae are also able to penetrate human skin and induce cercarial dermatitis. While the cellular and antibody responses against cercariae and migrating schistosomula have been investigated in mice, little is known about immune reactions in birds. This study first describes the dynamics of antibody response in infected ducks and identifies frequently recognized antigens that may serve as diagnostic markers of infection by T. regenti. METHODS: Groups of 35 domestic ducks and 10 mallards were exposed to different doses of T. regenti cercariae. Sera were collected at predefined time intervals and tested by ELISA for the presence of specific anti-cercarial IgY and IgM. Antigens recognized by the antibodies were identified on Western blots of cercariae and schistosomula. The applicability in immunodiagnostics was statistically evaluated by expression of specificity and sensitivity values for individual antigens. RESULTS: In ELISA, the levels of anti-cercarial IgM peaked on day 15 pi. Increased production of IgY associated with the later phases of infection was observed in most individuals around 20 dpi and culminated 30 dpi. The time course of antibody response did not differ among experimental groups, variations were only observed in the levels of specific IgY which depended rather on the age of ducks at the time of infection than on the infectious dose. On Western blots, 40 cercarial and 7 schistosomular antigens were recognized by IgY from infected ducks. Among them, 4 cercarial antigens of 50, 47, 32 and 19 kDa provided the most sensitive and specific reactions. CONCLUSIONS: Antigens of cercariae and schistosomula elicited distinct antibody response in ducks, which correlated positively with the age of animals at the time of infection. Several antigens originating in cercariae and fewer in schistosomula were recognized by IgY with diverse sensitivity and specificity; only a few seemed to be common to both stages. Four of them were considered as the most promising candidates for immunodiagnostics.

METHODS: This was a single-center, record-based retrospective study of all admitted patients diagnosed with culture-proven pulmonary TB between 2010 and 2018. The study was conducted at Prince Sultan Military Medical City (PSMMC) in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, a large tertiary care center consisting of 1,200 beds. Data were obtained from our TB notification records. Patients with smear-positive TB were investigated. Only the first 3 sputum smears for AFB were included in the analysis. The PCR results for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) were also included in the study. The incremental yield of the second and third smears was assessed. RESULTS: Overall, 240 patients were MTB-culture positive. A total of 126 (52.5%) patients were smear and culture positive, whereas 114 were culture positive but smear negative. Of 126 patients who were AFB smear positive, 98 (77.8%) were detected in the first specimen, 13 (10.3%) in the second specimen, and only 9 (7.1%) in the third specimen.

In order to obtain more insight into the origin of the systemic oxidative stress, the observed parameters were correlated with inflammatory biomarkers and biomarkers of multiorgan impairment. In this prospective study, we included 58 patients admitted between July and October 2020 with COVID-19 pneumonia. Significant changes in malondialdehyde, 8-hydroxy-2’-deoxyguanosine and advanced oxidation protein products levels exist during the course of COVID-19. Special emphasis should be placed on the fact that the pattern of changes differs between non-hospitalized and hospitalized individuals. Our results point to the time-dependent relation of oxidative stress parameters with inflammatory and multiorgan impairment biomarkers, as well as pulmonary patterns in COVID-19 pneumonia patients.

610509,Feline blood transfusions A pinker shade of pale,2011-01-31,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has made itself known to health care providers and families across the world in a matter of months. While primarily a respiratory disorder, it has also been shown to cause neurological symptoms, which can be a concern for Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients. Although PD is not as common as other conditions such as cardiovascular diseases, it affects millions of patients around the world whose care has been affected by the global pandemic. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this review is to provide insight into the direct and indirect associations between COVID-19 and PD patient care. RESULTS: Potential direct effects of COVID-19 include possible neurodegeneration, concerns of symptom self-management with over-the-counter (OTC) products and ICU challenges that can arise in PD patients. In addition, a subset of PD patients may be at higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection. The indirect effects of the pandemic are associated with the social distancing measures and disruptions in health care systems and PD clinical trials, which may negatively affect PD patients’ mental wellbeing and create barriers in controlling their PD symptoms. On a more positive note, telemedical care is quickly emerging as a primary communication tool for virtual patient care. However, further research should be conducted to examine the applicability of telemedicine across the entire PD population, such as those with more severe symptoms living in less developed areas. With all the uncertainty during this time, it is hopeful to hear many promising COVID-19 treatments being researched, one of them being a PD drug therapy, amantadine. CONCLUSION: Hopefully, we can consider this pandemic an opportunity to strengthen the PD community and learn more about the impact of the SARS-COV-2 virus. This review provides an overview of the interaction between COVID-19 and PD patients and future investigational retrospective studies are suggested to validate the observations.","Elbeddini, Ali; To, Anthony; Tayefehchamani, Yasamin; Wen, Cindy",J Clin Mov Disord,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40734-020-00089-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32782815/,156

As dental core trainees (DCT) working in hospitals, we have been at the forefront of the crisis and one of the first in line for redeployment. Therefore, we decided to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on the redeployment of DCTs across the UK. Materials and Methods Data for this study was collected and shared between three project researchers. All researchers were undergoing dental core training in Oral Surgery and Restorative dentistry at Guy’s Hospital, London. An online survey was sent out via email and online social media platforms to reach as many DCTs as possible in the United Kingdom. Implied consent was obtained by respondents on submission of the survey. The survey consisted of five sections and was branched, with respondents answering different sections depending on their redeployment status. No qualitative data was collected, as all questions included in the survey were dichotomous or multiple-choice questions. The last two questions were in the form of a 5-point Likert scale, inviting respondents to rate five statements from strongly agree to strongly disagree. Results A total of 150 participants responded, of which 34% had been redeployed due to the pandemic. The majority of DCTs were redeployed to an intensive care unit or similar setting, and over 75% of those redeployed were working with either COVID-19 positive/suspect patients. Additionally, 23.8% of respondents had stopped patient contact due to their medical status. Conclusion Many DCTs have been deployed to departments outside of their specialty and expressed some anxiety as a result. Inevitably, this has resulted in disruption to their training program and education over the last few months. The response across the United Kingdom has been understandably variable due to the differing demands of the hospital trusts within which the DCTs work.","Patel, Misha; Menhadji, Payvand; Mayor, Serena",Eur J Dent,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33321546/; https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0040-1719216,156

CyHV-3 has been implicated in a large number of disease outbreaks in carp populations causing up to 100% mortality. The aim of this study was to investigate the requirement of cholesterol-rich lipid rafts in CyHV-3 entry and replication in carp cells. Plasma membrane cholesterol was depleted from common carp brain (CCB) cells with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD). Treated and non-treated cells were infected with CyHV-3 and virus binding and infection parameters were assessed using RT-qPCR, immunocytochemistry and virus titration. The effect of cholesterol reduction severely stunted virus entry in vitro, however after cholesterol replenishment virus entry and subsequent replication rates were similar to the control infection. Furthermore, cholesterol depletion did not significantly influence virus binding and the subsequent post-entry replication stage, however had an impact on virus egress. Comparative analysis of the lipid compositions of CyHV-3 and CCB membrane fractions revealed strong similarities between the lipid composition of the CyHV-3 and CCB lipid rafts. The results presented here show that cholesterol-rich lipid rafts are important for the CyHV-3 replication cycle especially during entry and egress.","Brogden, Graham; Adamek, Mikołaj; Proepsting, Marcus J.; Ulrich, Reiner; Naim, Hassan Y.; Steinhagen, Dieter",Vet Microbiol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113515002205; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113515002205; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26059657/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2015.05.024,156
614320,Teaching space-group diagrams to chemistry students through a peer-tutoring approach,2021-08-27,"This article examines the economics of Africa's emerging air cargo supply chains, taking floriculture as a case study. Floriculture is an important employer, and earner of foreign exchange for several regions of central/southern and eastern Africa including more recently Ethiopia. Air transportation often plays a critical role when the supply-chain involves high-value, non-durable, relatively light-weight, and compact consignments such as flowers, and geographically when regions are difficult to access by other trunk modes. The success of air cargo chains, however, depend as much on the quality of surface modes serving various “last mile” access and egress functions, as well as efficient nodal interchange points and the availability of suitable airport and airline capacity. The last, because of the important role of belly-hold space, includes consideration of passenger as well as cargo specific services. To meet the needs of Africa's floriculture sector, a variety of supply-chain models have emerged that embrace air and surface links, as well as storage at various points in the chain. The paper considers the nature of these chains, the reason d'être for their structures, and their limitations.","Button, Kenneth",J Transp Geogr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32834672/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0966692320300776; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2020.102789; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966692320300776,156

Their worldwide epidemiologic evolution and distribution are mostly unknown. OBJECTIVE: To explore the evolution and geographic distribution of common cutaneous infestations and arthropod bites through an analysis of Google Trends. METHODS: Search trends from 2004 through March 2021 for common cutaneous infestations and arthropod bites were extracted from Google Trends, quantified, and analyzed. RESULTS: Time series decomposition showed that total search term volume for pubic lice decreased worldwide over the study period, while the interest for ticks, pediculosis, insect bites, scabies, lice, and bed bugs increased (in increasing order). The interest for bed bugs was more pronounced in the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics countries, interest for lice in Near East and Middle East countries, and interest for pubic lice in South American countries. Internet searches for bed bugs, insect bites, and ticks exhibited the highest seasonal patterns. LIMITATIONS: Retrospective analysis limits interpretation. CONCLUSION: Surveillance systems based on Google Trends may enhance the timeliness of traditional surveillance systems and suggest that, while most cutaneous infestations increase worldwide, pubic lice may be globally declining.","Simonart, Thierry; Lam Hoai, Xuân-Lan; De Maertelaer, Viviane",JAAD Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34505090/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jdin.2021.08.003,156

These challenges occur largely because behavior courses, like most organismal biology courses, often stress experiential learning through laboratories that involve live animals, as well as a lecture component that emphasizes formative assessment, discussion, and critical thinking. Although online behavior courses may be remote, they can still be interactive and social, and designed with inclusive pedagogy. Here, we discuss some of the key decisions that instructors should consider, provide recommendations, and point out new opportunities for student learning that stem directly from the move to online instruction. Specific topics include challenges related to generating an inclusive and engaging online learning environment, synchronous versus asynchronous formats, assignments that enhance student learning, testing format and execution, grade schemes, design of laboratory experiences including opportunities for community science, design of synthetic student projects, and workload balance for students and instructors. We designed this primer both for animal behavior instructors who need to quickly transition to online teaching in the midst of a pandemic, and for those facing such transitions in upcoming terms. Much of the manuscript's content should also be of general interest and value to instructors from all areas of organismal biology who are attempting to quickly transition to online teaching.","Hughes, Melissa; Bertram, Susan M.; Young, Anna M.; Merry, Justin W.; Kolluru, Gita R.; Dunlap, Aimee S.; Danielson‐Francois, Anne; Weiss, Stacey",Ethology,https://doi.org/10.1111/eth.13096; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33230358/,156

Our secondary aim was to compare physical activity estimates between objectively measured and self-reported physical activity level. Methods: In this descriptive, cross-sectional study, we assessed physical activity level using accelerometers and a validated questionnaire in 33 post-bariatric patients who reported to be adherent (n=15) or not (n=18) to social distancing measures. Results: Patients adherent to social distancing measures spent more time in sedentary behavior (1.1 hours/day [95%CI: 0.1, 2.2]; p=0.045) and less time in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (-12.2 min/day [95%CI: -23.8, -0.6]; p=0.040) compared to non-adherent ones. No difference was observed for light-intensity physical activity. Bland-Altman analysis comparing objective and subjective physical activity estimates showed a bias for time spent in sedentary behavior and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity of 2.8 hours/day and 8.5 min/day, respectively. Conclusion: Post-bariatric patients who were adherent to social distancing measures due to the Covid-19 outbreak were more inactive and sedentary than non-adherent ones. Additionally, questionnaire data widely underestimated sedentary behavior. Strategies to increase or at least sustain physical activity levels in post-bariatric patients exposed to social distancing measures are necessary during the Covid-19 pandemic.","Rezende, D.; Pinto, A.

The objective of this double-blind randomized clinical trial was to evaluate the effect of oral inorganic or organic zinc supplementation as a treatment for neonatal diarrhea in calves. Seventy nine 1 to 8 day old male Holstein calves on a California calf ranch were block randomized to one of 3 treatments within 24 h from their first onset of diarrhea. Calves received a daily dose of either a placebo composed of 80 mg of zinc-free powder, 381.54 mg of zinc methionine (Met) (equivalent to 80 mg of zinc), or 99.69 mg of zinc oxide (ZO) (equivalent to 80 mg of zinc) in 2 L of a zinc-free oral rehydration solution (ORS). Calves were treated once daily until normal fecal consistency or for a maximum of 14 days. Upon enrollment and exit, calves were weighed, and blood, feces, and liver biopsies were collected for trace mineral analysis. Fecal samples at enrollment and exit were tested for E. coli K99, Cryptosporidium spp., rotavirus and coronavirus. Pre-treatment liver zinc concentrations for the 71 calves in the placebo, zinc Met, and ZO treatment groups were 710.6 (SEM = 147.7), 852.3 (SEM = 129.6), and 750.7 (SEM = 202.9) mg/kg dry weight (DW), respectively. Exit liver zinc concentrations for the calves in the placebo, zinc Met, and ZO treatment groups were 728.9 (SEM = 182.9), 1141.0 (SEM = 423.8), and 636.8 (SEM = 81.5) mg/kg dry weight, respectively. Although statistically non-significant, there were clinically important findings identified for each of zinc Met and ZO treatments. Calves treated with zinc Met gained on average 40 g/day during a diarrhea episode compared to a weight loss of 67 g/day on average in the placebo-treated calves (Power 19.9%). Calves treated with ZO had 1.4 times higher hazard of clinical cure compared to calves in the placebo group (Power 5.3%). Calves that were fecal positive to cryptosporidium spp. at enrollment and treated with zinc Met had higher odds of testing negative at exit compared to placebo calves (Odds Ratio (OR) = 16.0). In contrast, calves treated with ZO tended to recover (fecal score = 1) one day earlier compared to calves treated with a placebo (8.5 d vs. 9.7 d). The current trial identified clinically important findings that warrant further research to investigate zinc's therapeutic effect for calf diarrhea.","Glover, A.D.; Puschner, B.; Rossow, H.A.; Lehenbauer, T.W.; Champagne, J.D.; Blanchard, P.C.; Aly, S.S.",Prev Vet Med,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167587713002791; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2013.09.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24074841/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167587713002791,156

Therapeutic drug inhibitors targeting angiogenesis are clinically effective. We have previously identified GT198 (gene symbol PSMC3IP, also known as Hop2) as an oncoprotein that induces tumor angiogenesis in human cancers, including oral cancer. In this study, we show that the GT198 protein is a direct drug target of more than a dozen oncology drugs and several clinically successful anticancer herbs. GT198 is a DNA repair protein that binds to DNA. Using an in vitro DNA-binding assay, we tested the approved oncology drug set VII from the National Cancer Institute containing 129 oncology drugs. Identified GT198 inhibitors include but are not limited to mitoxantrone, doxorubicin, paclitaxel, etoposide, dactinomycin, and imatinib. Paclitaxel and etoposide have higher binding affinities, whereas doxorubicin has higher binding efficacy due to competitive inhibition. GT198 shares protein sequence homology with DNA topoisomerases, which are known drug targets, so that GT198 is likely a new drug target previously unrecognized. To seek more powerful GT198 inhibitors, we further tested several anticancer herbal extracts. The positive anticancer herbs with high affinity and high efficacy are all clinically successful ones, including allspice from Jamaica, Gleditsia sinensis or honey locust from China, and BIRM from Ecuador. Partial purification of allspice using an organic chemical approach demonstrated great feasibility of natural product purification, when the activity is monitored by the in vitro DNA-binding assay using GT198 as a target. Together, our study reveals GT198 as a new targeting mechanism for existing oncology drugs. The study also delivers an excellent drug target suitable for compound identification and natural product purification. In particular, this study opens an opportunity to rapidly identify drugs with high efficacy and low toxicity from nature.","Pang, Junfeng; Gao, Jie; Zhang, Liyong; Mivechi, Nahid F.; Ko, Lan",Front Oral Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34476412/; https://doi.org/10.3389/froh.2021.679460,156

It occurs mostly in severe cases, particularly in those who have liver diseases and admitted to an intensive care unit. The main cause of increased liver biochemistries in Covid-19 patients related to used drugs, the presence of the ACE2 receptor in the liver, and robust inflammatory response. However, limited studies available regarding to jaundice in COVID19 patients. CASE PRESENTATION: Here we present a case of hyperbilirubinemia in a mild asymptomatic COVID-19 patient, the patient was diagnosed by RT-PCR three days prior to presentation fever, dark urine, and of acute onset of jaundice. The patient was diagnosed by physical examination and laboratory findings, and treated successfully by high-quality natural honey. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: A recent studies of COVID-19 increased total serum bilirubin have been reported, mostly after the appearance of the COVID-19 symptoms. The case in the current study was a 48-year-old male patient who was diagnosed with mild COVID-19 three days prior to presentation. After 2 days increased total serum bilirubin.

626594,Is HIV-1 evolving to a less virulent form in humans?,2007-01-04,"BACKGROUND: We evaluated features of HIV transmission networks involving persons diagnosed during incident HIV infection (IHI) to assess network-based opportunities to curtail onward transmission. METHODS: Transmission networks were constructed using partial pol sequences reported to North Carolina surveillance among persons with recent (2014–2018) and past (<2014) HIV diagnoses. IHI were defined as documented acute infections or seroconversion. Demographic and virologic features of HIV genetic clusters (<1.5% pairwise genetic distance) involving ≥ 1 IHI were assessed. Persons with viral genetic links and who had diagnoses >90 days prior to an IHI were further characterized. We assessed named partner outcomes among IHI index persons using contact tracing data. FINDINGS: Of 4,405 HIV diagnoses 2014–2018 with sequences, there were 323 (7%) IHI index persons; most were male (88%), Black (65%), young (68% <30 years), and reported sex with men (MSM) risk (79%). Index persons were more likely to be cluster members compared to non-index persons diagnosed during the same period (72% vs. 49%). In total, 162 clusters were identified involving 233 IHI, 577 recent diagnoses, and 163 past diagnoses. Most IHI cases (53%) had viral linkages to ≥1 previously diagnosed person without evidence of HIV viral suppression in the year prior to the diagnosis of the IHI index. In contact tracing, only 53% IHI cases named an HIV-positive contact, resulting in 0.5 previously diagnosed persons detected per IHI investigated. When combined with viral analyses, the detection rate of viremic previously diagnosed persons increased to 1.3. INTERPRETATION: Integrating public health with molecular epidemiology, revealed that more than half of IHI have viral links to persons with previously diagnosed unsuppressed HIV infection which was largely unrecognized by traditional contact tracing. Enhanced partner services to support engagement and retention in HIV care and improved case finding supported by rapid phylogenetic analysis are tools to substantially reduce onward HIV transmission.","Dennis, Ann M.; Frost, Simon D.W.; Enders, Kimberly; Cressman, Andrew E.; Volz, Erik; Adams, Nicole; Miller, William C.; Cohen, Myron S.; Mobley, Victoria; Samoff, Erika; Eron, Joseph J.",EClinicalMedicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2021.100968; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34195581/,156

Currently, there are no effective antivirals approved by the Food and Drug Administration to contain this pandemic except the antiviral agent remdesivir. In addition, the trimeric spike protein on the viral surface is highly glycosylated and almost 200,000 variants with mutations at more than 1,000 positions in its 1,273 amino acid sequence were reported, posing a major challenge in the development of antibodies and vaccines. It is therefore urgently needed to have alternative and timely treatments for the disease. In this study, we used a cell-based infection assay to screen more than 3,000 agents used in humans and animals, including 2,855 small molecules and 190 traditional herbal medicines, and identified 15 active small molecules in concentrations ranging from 0.1 nM to 50 μM. Two enzymatic assays, along with molecular modeling, were then developed to confirm those targeting the virus 3CL protease and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Several water extracts of herbal medicines were active in the cell-based assay and could be further developed as plant-derived anti–SARS-CoV-2 agents. Some of the active compounds identified in the screen were further tested in vivo, and it was found that mefloquine, nelfinavir, and extracts of Ganoderma lucidum (RF3), Perilla frutescens, and Mentha haplocalyx were effective in a challenge study using hamsters as disease model.","Jan, Jia-Tsrong; Cheng, Ting-Jen Rachel; Juang, Yu-Pu; Ma, Hsiu-Hua; Wu, Ying-Ta; Yang, Wen-Bin; Cheng, Cheng-Wei; Chen, Xiaorui; Chou, Ting-Hung; Shie, Jiun-Jie; Cheng, Wei-Chieh; Chein, Rong-Jie; Mao, Shi-Shan; Liang, Pi-Hui; Ma, Che; Hung, Shang-Cheng; Wong, Chi-Huey",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33452205/; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2021579118,156

METHODS: Computerized literature searches were performed from four search engines. The studies were selected based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The studies were screened using Covidence (Cochrane tool) and followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement standards (PRISMA-2009). A total 2645 studies were initially retrieved, of which a total of 17 studies met inclusion criteria. Two reviewers, blinded to each other, evaluated level and strength of evidence using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine Levels of Evidence and QualSyst, respectively. RESULTS: Dysphagia prevalence ranged from 16 to 78% among the eligible studies. Studies varied in operational definitions defining swallowing dysfunction (dysphagia) and method used to assess swallowing function. Approximately 70% of eligible studies demonstrated strong methodological quality. The majority of studies (n = 11; 65%) reported pharyngeal swallowing impairments in patients with OSAS, including delayed initiation of pharyngeal swallow and penetration/aspiration. CONCLUSION: This systematic review describes swallowing function in patients with OSAS. However, due to the variability in defining OSAS and dysphagia, in the assessment method used to determine dysphagia, and heterogeneity of study designs, true prevalence is difficult to determine. Clinicians involved in the management of OSAS patients should employ validated assessment measures to determine if swallow dysfunction is present.","Bhutada, Ankita M; Broughton, William A; Focht Garand, Kendrea L",Sleep Breath,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11325-020-02037-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32062752/,156

The large amounts of epidemiological data and the wealth of information deriving from animal models of gestational infections have contributed to delineate, in the last years, possible underpinning mechanisms for this phenomenon, including defects in neuronal migration, impaired spine and synaptic development, and altered activation of microglia. Recently, dysfunctions of the neurovascular unit and anomalies of the brain vasculature have unexpectedly emerged as potential causes at the origin of behavioral abnormalities and psychiatric disorders consequent to prenatal and perinatal infections. This review aims to discuss the up‐to‐date literature evidence pointing to the neurovascular unit and brain vasculature damages as the etiological mechanisms in neurodevelopmental syndromes. We focus on the inflammatory events consequent to intragravidic viral infections as well as on the direct viral effects as the potential primary triggers.

TB/HIV coinfections exert a tremendous burden on the host's immune system, and this has prompted the clinical use of immunomodulators to enhance host defences as an alternative therapeutic strategy. In this study, we modified the clinically used synthetic immunomodulatory pentapeptide, thymopentin (TP-5, RKDVY), with six arginine residues (RR-6, RRRRRR) at the N- and C-termini to obtain the cationic peptides, RR-11 (RKDVYRRRRRR-NH(2)) and RY-11 (RRRRRRRKDVY-NH(2)), respectively. The arginine residues conferred anti-mycobacterial activity to TP-5 in the peptides as shown by effective minimum inhibitory concentrations of 125 mg/L and killing efficiencies of >99.99% against both rifampicin-susceptible and -resistant Mycobacterium smegmatis. The immunomodulatory action of the peptides remained unaffected as shown by their ability to stimulate TNF-α production in RAW 264.7 mouse macrophage cells. A distinct change in surface morphology after peptide treatment was observed in scanning electron micrographs, while confocal microscopy and dye leakage studies suggested bacterial membrane disruption by the modified peptides. The modified peptides were non-toxic and did not cause hemolysis of rat red blood cells up to a concentration of 2000 mg/L. Moreover, RY-11 showed synergism with rifampicin and reduced the effective concentration of rifampicin, while preventing the induction of rifampicin resistance. The synthetic peptides may have a potential application in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised TB patients.","Wang, Ying; Ke, Xi-Yu; Khara, Jasmeet S.; Bahety, Priti; Liu, Shaoqiong; Seow, See Voon; Yang, Yi Yan; Ee, Pui Lai Rachel",Biomaterials,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24411680/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0142961213015330; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.12.049; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142961213015330,156

649233,The Worldwide Effort to Develop Vaccines for COVID-19.,2021,"COVID-19 has been one of the most serious global health crises in world history. During the pandemic, healthcare systems require accurate forecasts for key resources to guide preparation for patient surges. Forecasting the COVID-19 hospital census is among the most important planning decisions to ensure adequate staffing, number of beds, intensive care units, and vital equipment. In the literature, only a few papers have approached this problem from a multivariate time-series approach incorporating leading indicators for the hospital census. In this paper, we propose to use a leading indicator, the local COVID-19 infection incidence, together with the COVID-19 hospital census in a multivariate framework using a Vector Error Correction model (VECM) and aim to forecast the COVID-19 hospital census for the next 7 days. The model is also applied to produce scenario-based 60-day forecasts based on different trajectories of the pandemic. With several hypothesis tests and model diagnostics, we confirm that the two time-series have a cointegration relationship, which serves as an important predictor. Other diagnostics demonstrate the goodness-of-fit of the model. Using timeseries cross-validation, we can estimate the out-of-sample Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The model has a median MAPE of 5.9%, which is lower than the 6.6% median MAPE from a univariate Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model. In the application of scenario-based long-term forecasting, future census exhibits concave trajectories with peaks lagging 2-3 weeks later than the peak infection incidence. Our findings show that the local COVID-19 infection incidence can be successfully incorporated into a VECM with the COVID-19 hospital census to improve upon existing forecast models, and to deliver accurate short-term forecasts and realistic scenario-based long-term trajectories to help healthcare systems leaders in their decision making.","Nguyen, H.

Though the presentation of these conditions is diverse, a unifying factor is the role of immune and inflammatory responses in their development and/or progression. For example, infectious agents have been linked to pediatric cardiovascular disease, leading to a large health burden that disproportionately affects low-income areas. Other implicated mechanisms include antibody targeting of cardiac proteins, infection of cardiac cells, and inflammation-mediated damage to cardiac structures. These changes can alter blood flow patterns, change extracellular matrix composition, and induce cardiac remodeling. Therefore, understanding the relationship between the immune system and cardiovascular disease can inform targeted diagnostic and treatment approaches. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of pediatric immune-associated cardiac diseases, challenges in the field, and areas of research with potential for clinical benefit.","Jui, Elysa; Singampalli, Kavya L.; Shani, Kevin; Ning, Yao; Connell, Jennifer P.; Birla, Ravi K.; Bollyky, Paul L.; Caldarone, Christopher A.; Keswani, Sundeep G.; Grande-Allen, K.

In this study, we used pollution monitoring and meteorological data from January to May 2020 to analyze the air quality characteristics during the COVID-19 lockdown in Wuhan, which lasted from January 23 to April 8, 2020. Compared with the same period in 2019, the air quality in 2020 was significantly better. The total excellent and good air quality rates increased by 17.58%–90.08% in 2020; concentrations of NO(2), particulate matter with a diameter <10 μm (PM(10)) and <2.5 μm (PM(2.5)), and total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs) also decreased by 38.23%, 30.25%, 32.92%, and 39.80%, respectively. Moreover, the number of days with NO(2), PM(10), and PM(2.5) as the primary pollutants decreased by approximately 10%, 9%, and 15%, respectively. We compared the wind direction, wind speed, temperature, and relative humidity in January–April 2020, 2019, 2018, and 2017 and found no obvious correlation between meteorological factors and improved air quality during the 2020 lockdown. The implementation of strict lockdown measures, such as home quarantining, traffic restrictions, and non-essential enterprise shutdowns, was the dominant cause for the substantial air quality improvement during the 2020 COVID-19 lockdown in Wuhan.","Jiaxin, Chen; Hui, Hu; Feifei, Wang; Mi, Zhang; Ting, Zhou; Shicheng, Yuan; Ruoqiao, Bai; Nan, Chen; Ke, Xu; Hao, Huang",Environ Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935121001730; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33607094/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.110879; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0013935121001730,156
651681,Mechanics Insights of Alpha-Lipoic Acid against Cardiovascular Diseases during COVID-19 Infection,2021-07-26,"Background: Community engagement and volunteering are essential for the public response to COVID-19. Since March 2020 a large number of people in the UK have been regularly doing unpaid activities to benefit others besides their close relatives. Although most mutual aid groups emerged from local neighbourhoods and communities, official public institutions also fostered community volunteering, namely through the community champions scheme. By considering a broad definition of COVID-19 volunteering, this article describes a systematic review of the literature focused on two broad questions: What have we learned so far from COVID-19 volunteering both at the UK national level and the more local community level? What have we learned from engagement with local communities and community champions during the COVID-19 period? Methods: A rapid review of the literature in peer-reviewed databases and grey literature was applied in our search, following the PRISMA principles. The search was conducted from 10 to 16 of October 2020, and sources were included on the basis of having been published between January and October 2020, focusing on COVID-19 and addressing community groups, volunteering groups, volunteers, or community champions in the UK. Results: After initial screening, a total of 40 relevant sources were identified. From these, 28 were considered eligible. Findings suggest that food shopping and emotional support were the most common activities, but there were diverse models of organisation and coordination in COVID-19 volunteering. Additionally, community support groups seem to be adjusting their activities and scope of action to current needs and challenges. Volunteers were mostly women, middle-class, highly educated, and working-age people. Social networks and connections, local knowledge, and social trust were key dimensions associated with community organising and volunteering. Furthermore, despite the efforts of a few official public institutions and councils, there has been limited community engagement and collaboration with volunteering groups and other community-based organisations. Conclusions: We identified important factors for fostering community engagement and COVID volunteering as well as gaps in the current literature. We suggest that future research should be directed towards deepening knowledge on sustaining community engagement, collaboration and community participation over time, during and beyond this pandemic.","Mao, G.; Fernandes-Jesus, M.; Ntontis, E.; Drury, J.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.22.20236059; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.22.20236059v1?rss=1,156

Practical approach and common neurological differentials,2009-05-31,"Human respiratory virus infections lead to a spectrum of respiratory symptoms and disease severity, contributing to substantial morbidity, mortality and economic losses worldwide, as seen in the COVID-19 pandemic. Belonging to diverse families, respiratory viruses differ in how easy they spread (transmissibility) and the mechanism (modes) of transmission. Transmissibility as estimated by the basic reproduction number (R(0)) or secondary attack rate is heterogeneous for the same virus. Respiratory viruses can be transmitted via four major modes of transmission: direct (physical) contact, indirect contact (fomite), (large) droplets and (fine) aerosols. We know little about the relative contribution of each mode to the transmission of a particular virus in different settings, and how its variation affects transmissibility and transmission dynamics. Discussion on the particle size threshold between droplets and aerosols and the importance of aerosol transmission for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and influenza virus is ongoing. Mechanistic evidence supports the efficacies of non-pharmaceutical interventions with regard to virus reduction; however, more data are needed on their effectiveness in reducing transmission. Understanding the relative contribution of different modes to transmission is crucial to inform the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions in the population. Intervening against multiple modes of transmission should be more effective than acting on a single mode.","Leung, Nancy H.

661601,Ultrasonographic Examination of the Equine Neonate: Thorax and Abdomen,2015-11-23,"BACKGROUND: Confirmed H1N1 cases during late spring and summer 2009 in various countries showed a substantial age shift between importations and local transmission cases, with adults mainly responsible for seeding unaffected regions and children most frequently driving community outbreaks. METHODS: We introduce a multi-host stochastic metapopulation model with two age classes to analytically investigate the role of a heterogeneously mixing population and its associated non-homogeneous travel behaviors on the risk of a major epidemic. We inform the model with demographic data, contact data and travel statistics of Europe and Mexico, and calibrate it to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic early outbreak. We allow for variations of the model parameters to explore the conditions of invasion under different scenarios. RESULTS: We derive the expression for the potential of global invasion of the epidemic that depends on the transmissibility of the pathogen, the transportation network and mobility features, the demographic profile and the mixing pattern. Higher assortativity in the contact pattern greatly increases the probability of spatial containment of the epidemic, this effect being contrasted by an increase in the social activity of adults vs. children. Heterogeneous features of the mobility network characterizing its topology and traffic flows strongly favor the invasion of the pathogen at the spatial level, as also a larger fraction of children traveling. Variations in the demographic profile and mixing habits across countries lead to heterogeneous outbreak situations. Model results are compatible with the H1N1 spatial transmission dynamics observed. CONCLUSIONS: This work illustrates the importance of considering age-dependent mixing profiles and mobility features coupled together to study the conditions for the spatial invasion of an emerging influenza pandemic. Its results allow the immediate assessment of the risk of a major epidemic for a specific scenario upon availability of data, and the evaluation of the potential effectiveness of public health interventions targeting specific age groups, their interactions and mobility behaviors. The approach provides a general modeling framework that can be used for other types of partitions of the host population and applied to different settings.","Apolloni, Andrea; Poletto, Chiara; Colizza, Vittoria",BMC Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-13-176; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23587010/; https://arxiv.org/pdf/1304.0632v1.pdf,156

Here, we performed comprehensive environmental contamination surveillance to evaluate the risk of viral transmission in AIIRs with 115 rooms in three buildings at the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Shanghai, during the treatment of 334 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. The results showed that the risk of airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in AIIRs was low (1.62%, 25/1544) due to the directional airflow and strong environmental hygiene procedures. However, we detected viral RNA on the surface of foot-operated openers and bathroom sinks in AIIRs (viral load: 55.00–3154.50 copies/mL). This might be a source of contamination to connecting corridors and object surfaces through the footwear and gloves used by HCWs.

By harnessing an evolutionary conserved endogenous biological pathway, first identified in plants and lower organisms, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) reagents are used to bind to and promote the degradation of target RNAs, resulting in knockdown of the expression of specific genes. RNAi can be induced in mammalian cells by the introduction of synthetic double-stranded small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) 21–23 base pairs (bp) in length or by plasmid and viral vector systems that express double-stranded short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) that are subsequently processed to siRNAs by the cellular machinery. RNAi has been widely used in mammalian cells to define the functional roles of individual genes, particularly in disease. In addition, siRNA and shRNA libraries have been developed to allow the systematic analysis of genes required for disease processes such as cancer using high throughput RNAi screens. RNAi has been used for the knockdown of gene expression in experimental animals, with the development of shRNA systems that allow tissue-specific and inducible knockdown of genes promising to provide a quicker and cheaper way to generate transgenic animals than conventional approaches. Finally, because of the ability of RNAi to silence disease-associated genes in tissue culture and animal models, the development of RNAi-based reagents for clinical applications is gathering pace, as technological enhancements that improve siRNA stability and delivery in vivo, while minimising off-target and nonspecific effects, are developed.","Leung, Ray K.M.; Whittaker, Paul A.",Pharmacol Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15908010/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163725805000628; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163725805000628,156

Yet, how mRNA vaccines stimulate the immune system to elicit protective immune responses is unknown. Here we used a systems biological approach to comprehensively profile the innate and adaptive immune responses in 56 healthy volunteers vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine. Vaccination resulted in robust production of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) against the parent strain and the variant of concern, B.1.351, but no induction of autoantibodies, and significant increases in antigen-specific polyfunctional CD4 and CD8 T cells after the second dose. The innate response induced within the first 2 days of booster vaccination was profoundly increased, relative to the response at corresponding times after priming. Thus, there was a striking increase in the: (i) frequency of CD14+CD16+ inflammatory monocytes; (ii) concentration of IFN- y in the plasma, which correlated with enhanced pSTAT3 and pSTAT1 levels in monocytes and T cells; and (iii) transcriptional signatures of innate responses characteristic of antiviral vaccine responses against pandemic influenza, HIV and Ebola, within 2 days following booster vaccination compared to primary vaccination. Consistent with these observations, single-cell transcriptomics analysis of 242,479 leukocytes demonstrated a ~100-fold increase in the frequency of a myeloid cluster, enriched in a signature of interferon-response transcription factors (TFs) and reduced in AP-1 TFs, one day after secondary immunization, at day 21. Finally, we delineated distinct molecular pathways of innate activation that correlate with CD8 T cell and nAb responses and identified an early monocyte-related signature that was associated with the breadth of the nAb response against the B1.351 variant strain. Collectively, these data provide insights into the immune responses induced by mRNA vaccines and demonstrate their capacity to stimulate an enhanced innate response following booster immunization.","Pulendran, Bali; Arunachalam, Prabhu S",Res Sq,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34013244/; https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-438662/v1,156

Using difference-in-differences and event study analyses, we show that SAHO and the pandemic led to a fall in abortions of around 25% and find no evidence that unsafe abortions increased. We find a decrease in the share of single and teenage women getting abortions, arguably due to fewer unwanted pregnancies from decreased sexual activity, and estimate that at most 9.8% of the total fall in abortions can be attributed to this.

ABCD guidelines on prevention and management,2009-07-31,"Over the last two decades, there have been three deadly human outbreaks of Coronaviruses (CoVs) caused by emerging zoonotic CoVs: SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and the latest highly transmissible and deadly SARS-CoV-2, which has caused the current COVID-19 global pandemic. All three deadly CoVs originated from bats, the natural hosts, and transmitted to humans via various intermediate animal reservoirs. Because there is currently no universal pan-Coronavirus vaccine available, two worst-case scenarios remain highly possible: (1) SARS-CoV-2 mutates and transforms into a seasonal “flu-like” global pandemic; and/or (2) Other global COVID-like pandemics will emerge in the coming years, caused by yet another spillover of an unknown zoonotic bat-derived SARS-like Coronavirus (SL-CoV) into an unvaccinated human population. Determining the antigen and epitope landscapes that are conserved among human and animal Coronaviruses as well as the repertoire, phenotype and function of B cells and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that correlate with resistance seen in asymptomatic COVID-19 patients should inform in the development of pan-Coronavirus vaccines 1. In the present study, using several immuno-informatics and sequence alignment approaches, we identified several human B-cell, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell epitopes that are highly conserved in: (i) greater than 81,000 SARS-CoV-2 human strains identified to date in 190 countries on six continents; (ii) six circulating CoVs that caused previous human outbreaks of the “Common Cold”; (iii) five SL-CoVs isolated from bats; (iv) five SL-CoV isolated from pangolins; (v) three SL-CoVs isolated from Civet Cats; and (vi) four MERS strains isolated from camels. Furthermore, we identified cross-reactive asymptomatic epitopes that: (i) recalled B cell, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses from both asymptomatic COVID-19 patients and healthy individuals who were never exposed to SARS-CoV-2; and (ii) induced strong B cell and T cell responses in “humanized” Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-DR/HLA-A*02:01 double transgenic mice.

677366,"Generation, characterization and therapeutic potential of anti-feline TNF-alpha MAbs for feline infectious peritonitis",2013-09-19,"OBJECTIVES: The aim is to review current literature related to the diagnosis, management, and follow-up of suspected and confirmed Covid-19 cases. KEY FINDINGS: Medical Imaging plays an important auxiliary role in the diagnosis of Covid-19 patients, mainly those most seriously affected. Practice differs widely among different countries, mainly due to the variability of access to resources (viral testing and imaging equipment, specialised staff, protective equipment). It has been now well-documented that chest radiographs should be the first-line imaging tool and chest CT should only be reserved for critically ill patients, or when chest radiograph and clinical presentation may be inconclusive. CONCLUSION: As radiographers work on the frontline, they should be aware of the potential risks associated with Covid-19 and engage in optimal strategies to reduce these. Their role in vetting, conducting and often reporting the imaging examinations is vital as well as their contribution in patient safety and care. Medical Imaging should be limited to critically ill patients, and where it may have an impact on the patient management plan. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: At the time of publication, this review offers the most up-to-date recommendations for clinical practitioners in radiology departments, including radiographers. Radiography practice has to significantly adjust to these new requirements to support optimal and safe imaging practices for the diagnosis of Covid-19. The adoption of low dose CT, rigorous infection control protocols and optimal use of personal protective equipment may reduce the potential risks of radiation exposure and infection, respectively, within Radiology departments.","Stogiannos, N.; Fotopoulos, D.; Woznitza, N.; Malamateniou, C.",Radiography (Lond),https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1078817420300845; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32532596/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1078817420300845; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.radi.2020.05.012,156

This study aimed to explore this phenomenon by comparing the reasons why, the methods how, and by whom “Pandemic Puppies” were purchased during this period (from 23 March 2020–31 December 2020), and compare these responses with owners who purchased their dog during the same date-period in 2019. Valid responses were analysed from owners of 1148 puppies from 2019 and 4369 Pandemic Puppies. Key differences included Pandemic Puppy owners being more likely to be first-time dog owners, have children in their household, pay a deposit without seeing their puppy, collect their puppy from outside their breeders’ property, see their puppy without their littermates, and pay > £2000 for their puppy, compared with 2019 puppies. Over 1 in 10 Pandemic Puppy owners had not considered purchasing a puppy before the pandemic, while 2 in 5 felt their decision to purchase a puppy had been influenced by the pandemic, most commonly due to having more time to care for a dog. Changes in puppy purchasing during the pandemic raise a range of welfare concerns including relinquishment, behavioural problems and poor health. ABSTRACT: Widespread media reports suggest that unusually high numbers of the public purchased, or sought to purchase, puppies following the first ‘lockdown’ phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK, dubbed “Pandemic Puppies”. This study aimed to explore this phenomenon by comparing pre-purchase motivations and behaviours, and purchase behaviours of UK owners purchasing puppies aged < 16 weeks from 23 March 2020–31 December 2020 with those of owners who purchased puppies during the same date-period in 2019. An online survey was conducted during November-December 2020, from which 5517 valid responses were analysed (2019 puppies: n = 1148; 2020 ‘Pandemic Puppies’: n = 4369). Over 1 in 10 Pandemic Puppy owners had not considered purchasing a puppy before the pandemic, and 2 in 5 felt their decision to purchase a puppy had been influenced by the pandemic, most commonly by having more time to care for a dog (86.7%). Multivariable logistic regression models revealed that Pandemic Puppy owners were more likely to be first-time dog owners and have children in their household, were less likely to seek out a breeder that performed health testing on their breeding dog(s) or view their puppy in-person, and were more likely to pay a deposit without seeing their puppy. At purchase, Pandemic Puppies were more likely to be younger, delivered or collected from outside their breeders’ property, seen without their littermates, and cost > £2000 compared with 2019 puppies. Changes in puppy purchasing during the pandemic raise welfare concerns for this unique population, including relinquishment, behavioural problems and poor health.","Packer, Rowena M.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 is an unprecedented global crisis that has not been experienced, which is still disrupting health systems, economies, and societies around the world by the rapid spread. Bronchoscopy plays an important role in diagnosis and therapy of pulmonary diseases, especially in patients with severe pulmonary infection, however, application of bronchoscopy in patients suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection is extremely limited for the potential airborne transmission from aerosol generated during the procedure. This consensus statement was completed by expert panel of Interventional & Minimally Invasive Respiratory Committee of China Medical Education Association, and the issues were summarized as seven key topics to define the indications of bronchoscopy and matters needing attentions on the bronchoscopy procedures in patients with COVID-19, as well as the protective precaution strategies to avoid nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Yang, Huizhen; Chen, Huidong; Gao, Baoan; Xiong, Weining; Zhang, Xiaoju; Hogarth, D.

684638,Emerging Role for Ferroptosis in Infectious Diseases.,2021,"AIMS: Implantable device‐based sensor measurements including heart sounds, markers of ventilation, and thoracic impedance have been shown to predict heart failure (HF) hospitalizations. We sought to assess how these parameters changed prior to COVID‐19 (Cov‐19) and how these compared with those presenting with decompensated HF or pneumonia. METHODS AND RESULTS: This retrospective analysis explores patterns of changes in daily measurements by implantable sensors in 10 patients with Cov‐19 and compares these findings with those observed prior to HF (n = 88) and pneumonia (n = 12) hospitalizations from the MultiSENSE, PREEMPT‐HF, and MANAGE‐HF trials. The earliest sensor changes prior to Cov‐19 were observed in respiratory rate (6 days) and temperature (5 days). There was a three‐fold to four‐fold greater increase in respiratory rate, rapid shallow breathing index, and night heart rate compared with those presenting with HF or pneumonia. Furthermore, activity levels fell more in those presenting with Cov‐19, a change that was often sustained for some time. In contrast, there were no significant changes in 1st or 3rd heart sound (S(1) and S(3)) amplitude in those presenting with Cov‐19 or pneumonia compared with the known changes that occur in HF decompensation. CONCLUSIONS: Multi‐sensor device diagnostics may provide early detection of Cov‐19, distinguishable from worsening HF by an extreme and fast rise in respiratory rate along with no changes in S3.","Gardner, Roy S.; Capodilupo, Robert C.; Ahmed, Rezwan; Stolen, Craig M.; An, Qi; Averina, Viktoria; Hernandez, Adrian F.; Boehmer, John P.",ESC Heart Fail,https://doi.org/10.1002/ehf2.13500; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34184428/,156
686523,Transplantation of murine oligodendrocytes and JHMV-infected astrocytes into demyelinating lesions in the rat spinal cord,1994-10-31,"After the outbreak of Corona virus pandemic in Italy, the government has taken extraordinary measures, including a national lockdown, to prevent the spread of the infection. This extraordinary situation has led to a reduction in air pollution levels measured in the whole Po Valley, usually known as one of the most polluted areas in Europe in terms of particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen dioxide (NO [Formula: see text]) concentrations. The main aim of this paper is to evaluate the effectiveness of the lockdown on the air quality improvement. In particular, an interrupted time series modelling approach is employed to test if a significant change in the level and the trend of the pollutant time series has occurred after the lockdown measure. The case study regards the city of Brescia (Northern Italy) and focuses on the comparison of the period before (January 1st–March 7th, 2020) and after (March 8th–March 27th, 2020) the lockdown. By adjusting for meteorology and Sunday effect, the results show that a significant change in air quality occurring in the post intervention period was observed only for a single NO [Formula: see text] station located in a heavy traffic zone. In particular, the estimate of the time series slope, i.e. the expected change in the concentration associated with a time unit increase, decreases from -0.25 to -1.67 after the lockdown. For the remaining stations, no significant change was found in the concentration time series when comparing the two periods. This confirms the complexity of air pollutant concentration dynamics for the considered area, which is not merely related to emission sources but depends also on other factors as, for example, (micro and macro) meteorological conditions and the chemical and physical processes in the atmosphere, which are all independent of the lockdown measure.","Cameletti, Michela",Atmos Environ (1994),https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1352231020305288; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231020305288?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2020.117794; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32834728/,156

Until now, no effective antivirals have been developed for the therapeutic treatment of PEDV infection. In the present study, we found that quercetin significantly suppressed PEDV infection at noncytotoxic concentrations. A molecular docking study indicated that quercetin might bind the active site and binding pocket of PEDV 3C-like protease (3CL(pro)). Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis revealed that quercetin exhibited a binding affinity to PEDV 3CL(pro). Based on the results of the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay, quercetin was proven to exert an inhibitory effect on PEDV 3CL(pro). Since coronavirus 3CL(pro) is an important drug target and participates in the viral replication process, quercetin should be developed as a novel drug in the control of PEDV infection.","Li, Zhonghua; Cao, Hua; Cheng, Yufang; Zhang, Xiaoqian; Zeng, Wei; Sun, Yumei; Chen, Shuhua; He, Qigai; Han, Heyou",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33142980/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21218095,156
