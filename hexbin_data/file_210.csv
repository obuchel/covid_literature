This paper examines the most regularly used and preferred cricothyrotomy devices on the market, suggests critical design specifications for improving cricothyrotomy devices, introduces a new cricothyrotomy device, and performs an engineering evaluation of the device’s critical components. Through a review of literature, manufacturer products, and patents, four principal cricothyrotomy devices currently in clinical use were identified. From the review, the Cook™ Melker device is the preferred method of clinicians but the device has acknowledged problems. A new emergency needle cricothyrotomy device (ENCD) was developed to address all design specifications identified in literature. Engineering, theoretical, and experimental assessments were performed. In situ evaluations of a prototype of the new device using porcine specimens to assess insertion, extraction, and cyclic force capabilities were performed. The device was very successful in its evaluation. Further discussion focuses on these aspects and a comparison of the new device with established devices. The proposed emergency needle cricothyrotomy device performed very well. Further work will be pursued in the future with in-vitro and in-vivo with canine models demonstrates the capabilities of the ENCD.","Carey, Jason P.; Gwin, Morgan; Kan, Andrew; Toogood, Roger; Finegan, Barry",J Med Device,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7164494/,210
12962,Timing of surgery after recovery from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection,2020-07-03,"Epidemiological surveillance of Shigella spp. in Australia is conducted to inform public health response. Multi-drug resistance has recently emerged as a contributing factor to sustained local transmission of Shigella spp. All data were collected as part of routine public health surveillance, and strains were whole-genome sequenced for further molecular characterisation. 108 patients with an endemic regional Shigella flexneri strain were identified between 2016 and 2019. The S. flexneri phylogroup 3 strain endemic to northern Australia acquired a multi-drug resistance conferring bla(DHA) plasmid, which has an IncFII plasmid backbone with virulence and resistance elements typically found in IncR plasmids. This is the first report of multi-drug resistance in Shigella sp. in Australia that is not associated with men who have sex with men. This strain caused an outbreak of multi-drug-resistant S. flexneri in northern Australia that disproportionality affects Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. Community controlled public health action is recommended.

19943,"Answer to Letter Concerning the Paper “Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Trial with N-acetylcysteine for Treatment of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Caused by COVID-19”",2021-01-27,"In order to use a Hemoglobin Based Oxygen Carrier as an oxygen therapeutic or blood substitute, it is necessary to increase the size of the hemoglobin molecule to prevent rapid renal clearance. A common method uses maleimide PEGylation of sulfhydryls created by the reaction of 2-iminothiolane at surface lysines. However, this creates highly heterogenous mixtures of molecules. We recently engineered a hemoglobin with a single novel, reactive cysteine residue on the surface of the alpha subunit creating a single PEGylation site (βCys93Ala/αAla19Cys). This enabled homogenous PEGylation by maleimide-PEG with >80% efficiency and no discernible effect on protein function. However, maleimide-PEG adducts are subject to deconjugation via retro-Michael reactions and cross-conjugation to endogenous thiol species in vivo. We therefore compared our maleimide-PEG adduct with one created using a mono-sulfone-PEG less susceptible to deconjugation. Mono-sulfone-PEG underwent reaction at αAla19Cys hemoglobin with > 80% efficiency, although some side reactions were observed at higher PEG:hemoglobin ratios; the adduct bound oxygen with similar affinity and cooperativity as wild type hemoglobin. When directly compared to maleimide-PEG, the mono-sulfone-PEG adduct was significantly more stable when incubated at 37°C for seven days in the presence of 1 mM reduced glutathione. Hemoglobin treated with mono-sulfone-PEG retained > 90% of its conjugation, whereas for maleimide-PEG < 70% of the maleimide-PEG conjugate remained intact. Although maleimide-PEGylation is certainly stable enough for acute therapeutic use as an oxygen therapeutic, for pharmaceuticals intended for longer vascular retention (weeks-months), reagents such as mono-sulfone-PEG may be more appropriate.","Cooper, Chris E.; Bird, Matthew; Sheng, XiaoBo; Choi, Ji-Won; Silkstone, Gary G.A.; Simons, Michelle; Syrett, Natalie; Piano, Riccardo; Ronda, Luca; Bettati, Stefano; Paredi, Gianluca; Mozzarelli, Andrea; Reeder, Brandon J.",Front Chem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8350135/,210

37842,Chilblain-like lesions likely associated with coronavirus disease 2019: A Canadian case presentation,2020-06-19,"Sharing Economy apps, such as Uber, Airbnb, and TaskRabbit, have generated a substantial consumer interest over the past decade. The unique form of peer-to-peer business exchange these apps have enabled has been linked to significant levels of economic growth, helping people in resource-constrained communities to build social capital and move up the economic ladder. However, due to the multidimensional nature of their operational environments, and the lack of effective methods for capturing and describing their end-users’ concerns, Sharing Economy apps often struggle to survive. To address these challenges, in this paper, we examine crowd feedback in ecosystems of Sharing Economy apps. Specifically, we present a case study targeting the ecosystem of food delivery apps. Using qualitative analysis methods, we synthesize important user concerns present in the Twitter feeds and app store reviews of these apps. We further propose and intrinsically evaluate an automated procedure for generating a succinct model of these concerns. Our work provides a first step toward building a full understanding of user needs in ecosystems of Sharing Economy apps. Our objective is to provide Sharing Economy app developers with systematic guidelines to help them maximize their market fitness and mitigate their end-users’ concerns and optimize their experience.","Williams, Grant; Tushev, Miroslav; Ebrahimi, Fahimeh; Mahmoud, Anas",Autom Softw Eng,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7415131/,210

Such conspiracy theories spread whenever people have to deal with surprising and frightening events. This article provides an overview of the history of conspiracy theories and explores the question of which persons are prone to conspiracy theories and for what reasons. From a psychodynamic perspective these are people who, partly from unconscious motives, tend to accuse others of having hostile intentions against which they have to defend themselves by force. From some parallels to conflictual psychotherapeutic relationship situations, initial suggestions can be derived for a constructive approach to conspiracy theory supporters in educational and political contexts.","Körner, Jürgen",Forum Psychoanal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7577208/,210

42271,"Three mild cases of coronavirus disease 2019 treated with saikatsugekito, a Japanese herbal medicine",2020-10-11,"BACKGROUND: With the global surge in COVID-19 pandemic, it has become inevitable for everyone, inclusive of nuclear medicine personnel, to play their role in combating and containing its transmission. During fall 2019, China encountered a novel coronavirus in Wuhan city which was later on termed as COVID-19. The pneumonia caused by COVID-19 is characterized by dry cough, fever, fatigue, and shortness of breathing (dyspnea). Until now, this virus has spread worldwide and continues to cause exponential causalities. MAIN BODY: This global catastrophic scenario calls for stringent measures to control COVID-19 infection. Thus herein, the respective authors have endeavored to review precautionary measures for nuclear medicine department, encompassing its personnel as well as the patients so that intradepartmental transmission can be prevented. This requires development and execution of a robust and dynamic plan elaborating the healthcare guidelines. Hence, our review paper covers the arena of nuclear medicine services in particular. CONCLUSION: Nuclear medicine can play its role in mitigating COVID-19 transmission to personnel and patients if provided with ample PPEs and guidelines are strictly followed. With implementing SOPs (standard operating procedures) based on these guidelines, nuclear medicine facilities will be better prepared for impromptu actions in case of any future outbreak while retaining the smooth flow of obligatory healthcare services.","Iqbal, Muhammad; Shahbaz, Muhammad; Qadeer, Owais Bin; Nazir, Kanwal; Naeem, Muhammad; Afzal, Muhammad Shahzad; Imran, Muhammad Babar",Egypt J Radiol Nucl Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7667283/,210

Methods: We analyzed questionnaire data from the end of May 2020 from 180 hospitals (102,578 beds) certified by the Japanese Association for Acute Medicine. Results: Acute (emergency) medicine physicians treated severe COVID–19 patients in more than half of hospitals. Emergency medical teams consisted of acute medicine physicians and other specialists. Frontline acute care physicians were concerned about their risk of infection in 80% of hospitals, and experienced stress due to a lack of personal protective equipment. Twenty–six of the 143 hospitals that had a mental health check/consultation system in place indicated that there was a doctor who experienced mental health problems. Of the 37 hospitals without a system, only one hospital was aware of the presence of a doctor complaining of mental health problems. Conclusion: Acute care physicians and physicians in other departments experienced high levels of stress as they fought to arrange COVID–19 treatment teams and inpatient COVID–19 wards for infected patients. Medical materials and equipment may be sufficient for a second or third wave; however, active support is needed for the physical and mental care of medical staff.

55370,Graphene‐based Materials for Fighting Coronavirus Disease 2019: Challenges and Opportunities,2021-03-23,"BACKGROUND: Considering its significant potential for improving medical care, telemedicine continues to be underutilized. Despite some successful pilot projects in recent years, little is known about the barriers to the establishment and permanence of telemedicine. We conducted this study to understand the attitudes of neurologists in private practice regarding the use of telemedicine in epileptology and resulting barriers. At the same time, we present possible solutions. METHODS: Using an individually designed 14-item questionnaire, we prospectively surveyed all neurologists who had previously not responded or had declined participation in a transregional telemedicine pilot project regarding perceived barriers to the use of telemedicine. RESULTS: Of 58 contacted neurologists, 33 (57%) responded. The most common reasons for not using telemedicine were a perceived lack of time or a suspected excessive organizational burden (49%), concerns about technical equipment (30%), and a preference for alternative ways of intersectoral communication (30%). Feared problems related to reimbursement for telemedicine services were an obstacle for 27%. Neurologists in rural areas were significantly more willing to first request a telemedicine consultation before making a referral (p = 0.006). CONCLUSION: The widespread establishment of telemedicine is still hindered by obstacles, most of which are organizational. The existing healthcare challenges in rural areas are a particular opportunity for the implementation of telemedicine. Most barriers to telemedicine can be solved but should be considered from the onset when designing pilot projects in order to facilitate their continuation.","Zöllner, Johann Philipp; Noda, Anna H.; McCoy, Jeannie; Roth, Christian; Fischer, Doris; Bollensen, Edgar; Henn, Karl-Heinz; Willems, Laurent M.; Leyer, Anne-Christine; Schubert-Bast, Susanne; Rosenow, Felix; Strzelczyk, Adam",Z,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8243621/,210
55393,Covid‐19 Vaccination Rollout,2021-03-06,"Hypertension and diabetes often appear together and increase cardiovascular mortality. Both diseases do frequently occur in patients with a severe course of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). Data in the literature are contradictory. A surrogate effect seems to be likely since older patients do often present a severe course due to their pre-existing pathologic conditions. Renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors do not increase the probability of a positive test for SARS-CoV‑2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). They have no impact on the severity or mortality and must not be discontinued. Renal denervation reappears after study designs and technologies developed much further. Knowledge regarding SGLT2 (sodium glucose linked transporter 2) inhibitors has been increased enormously. The first two large randomized controlled trials with primary renal endpoints emerged and demonstrated a significantly slower progression of diabetic nephropathy postponing the initialization of chronic hemodialysis therapy by about 12 to 13 years. SGLT2 inhibitors can be used in type 2 and type 1 diabetic patients and patients with heart failure with or without diabetes. They decrease the systolic blood pressure independent of the basic blood pressure. However, this effect does not explain the improvement of cardiorenal endpoints. The nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) finerenone is protective for heart and kidneys in type 2 diabetic patients regarding cardiovascular mortality and kidney failure. As with classic MRAs hyperkalemia is seen with this substance as well, particularly in higher chronic kidney disease stages. Larger studies comparing classic MRAs do not exist. Finerenone approval in Germany is pending.","Lindner, Tom H.",Diabetologe,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8246430/,210

However, differences between the 2 conditions have been reported, and we hypothesized that dynamic aspects of sleep would be different in the 2 groups of patients. PARTICIPANTS Subjects were 26 healthy control subjects, 14 patients with CFS but without FM (CFS alone), and 12 patients with CFS and FM (CFS+FM)-all women. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS We studied transition probabilities and rates between sleep stages (waking, rapid eye movement [REM] sleep, stage 1 [S1], stage 2 [S2], and slow-wave sleep [SWS]) and duration distributions of each sleep stage. We found that the probability of transition from REM sleep to waking was significantly greater in subjects with CFS alone than in control subjects, which may be the specific sleep problem for people with CFS alone. Probabilities of (a) transitions from waking, REM sleep, and S1 to S2 and (b) those from SWS to waking and S1 were significantly greater in subjects with CFS+FM than in control subjects; in addition, rates of these transitions were also significantly increased in subjects with CFS+FM. Result (a) might indicate increased sleep pressure in subjects with CFS+FM whereas result (b) may be the specific sleep problem of subjects with CFS+FM. We also found that shorter durations of S2 sleep are specific to patients with CFS+FM, not to CFS alone.

It is important to understand the factors influencing self-medication. A total of 3257 studies were screened and nine studies (six quantitative and three qualitative) were included. The Hawker tool and Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal tool were used to assess the quality of studies. The findings of the quantitative studies were descriptively analysed while thematic analysis was performed to identify key themes from the qualitative studies. The analysis indicated that participants had greater trust in traditional medications regardless of their socioeconomic and/or educational backgrounds as these were often recommended by friends and family members. Low cost, ease of availability and perceived lower side effects of traditional medications were some of the factors contributing to greater trust. It is suggested that ongoing management of type 2 diabetes requires stringent policies and regulations in the dispensing of traditional and western medications.

To date, however, there is a lack of synthesis of this evidence, examining commonalities, differences, and gaps. To identify and synthesize literature on international palliative care research priorities originating from Western countries mapped to a quality assessment framework. METHODS A systematic review of several academic and grey databases were searched from January 2008-June 2019 for studies eliciting research priorities in palliative care in English. Two researchers independently reviewed, critically appraised, and conducted data extraction and synthesis. RESULTS The search yielded 10,235 articles (academic databases, n = 4108; grey literature, n = 6127), of which ten were included for appraisal and review. Priority areas were identified: service models; continuity of care; training and education; inequality; communication; living well and independently; and recognising family/carer needs and the importance of families. Methodological approaches and process of reporting varied. There was little representation of patient and caregiver driven agendas. The priorities were mapped to the Donabedian framework for assessing quality reflecting structure, process and outcomes and key priority areas. CONCLUSIONS Limited evidence exists pertaining to research priorities across palliative care. Whilst a broad range of topics were elicited, approaches and samples varied questioning the credibility of findings. The voice of the care provider dominated, calling for more inclusive means to capture the patient and family voice. The findings of this study may serve as a template to understand the commonalities of research, identify gaps, and extend the palliative care research agenda.","Hasson, Felicity; Nicholson, Emma; Muldrew, Deborah; Bamidele, Olufikayo; Payne, Sheila; McIlfatrick, Sonja",BMC palliative care,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12904-020-0520-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32013949/,210

FRET-based biosensors with spectrally distinct fluorophore pairs provide clear contrast between cells during dual FRET live cell imaging. Here, we have developed a new FRET-based Ca2+ biosensor using EGFP and FusionRed fluorophores (FRET-GFPRed). Using different filter settings, the developed biosensor can be differentiated from a typical FRET-based Ca2+ biosensor with ECFP and YPet (YC3.6 FRET Ca2+ biosensor, FRET-CFPYPet). A high-frequency ultrasound (HFU) with a carrier frequency of 150 MHz can target a subcellular region due to its tight focus smaller than 10 µm. Therefore, HFU offers a new single cell stimulations approach for FRET live cell imaging with precise spatial resolution and repeated stimulation for longitudinal studies. Furthermore, the single cell level intracellular delivery of a desired FRET-based biosensor into target cells using HFU enables us to perform dual FRET imaging of a cell pair. We show that a cell pair is defined by sequential intracellular delivery of the developed FRET-GFPRed and FRET-CFPYPet into two target cells using HFU. We demonstrate that a FRET-GFPRed exhibits consistent 10-15% FRET response under typical ionomycin stimulation as well as under a new stimulation strategy with HFU.","Yoon, Sangpil; Pan, Yijia; Shung, Kirk; Wang, Yingxiao",Sensors,https://doi.org/10.3390/s20174998; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32899249/,210

Serum cobalamin and folate concentrations in an ex situ population of killer whales ( Orcinus orca) were measured and factors that may affect their serum concentrations were identified. Serum samples ( n = 104) were analyzed from killer whales ( n = 10) both while clinically healthy and during periods of clinical GI disease as defined by clinical signs and fecal cytology. To characterize serum cobalamin and folate concentrations in clinically healthy animals, a mixed-model regression was used, with cobalamin and folate both significantly affected by weight (cobalamin: P < 0.0001, folate: P = 0.006) and season (cobalamin: P < 0.0001, folate: P < 0.0001). The marginal mean concentrations for cobalamin and folate across weight and season were 742 ± 53.6 ng/L and 30.2 ± 2.6 μg/L, respectively. The predicted 95% confidence intervals (CI) for these analytes were then compared with samples collected during periods of GI disease. Across individuals, 22% (2/9) of the folate and 80% (8/10) of the cobalamin samples from the animals with GI disease fell outside the 95% CI for the population. When comparing samples within an individual, a similar pattern presented, with 100% of cobalamin of the observed abnormal samples reduced compared to healthy animal concentration variability. The same was not true for folate. These results suggest that serum concentrations of cobalamin and folate may be useful minimally invasive markers to identify GI disease in killer whales, especially when values are compared within an individual.","Tang, Karisa N; Nollens, Hendrik H; Robeck, Todd R; Schmitt, Todd L",Journal of zoo and wildlife medicine : official publication of the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians,https://doi.org/10.1638/2017-0102.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30212340/,210

In this study, using a chemical synthesized complete genome of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) strain SA14 (GenBank accession no. U14163), we constructed a full-length genomic cDNA clone of JEV. The recovered virus from the cDNA clone replicated poorly in baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells and in suckling mice brain. Following serial passage in BHK-21 cells, adaptive mutations within the NS2B and NS4A proteins were recovered in the passaged viruses leading to viruses with a large-plaque phenotype. Mutagenesis analysis, using a genome-length RNA and a replicon of JEV, demonstrated that the adaptive mutations restored replication to different degrees, and the restoration efficiencies were in the order: NS2B-T102M<NS4A-R79K<NS2B-T102M+NS4A-R79K. An in vivo virulence assay in mice showed that the recombinant virus containing double mutations showed similar virulence to the WT SA14 (GenBank accession no. M55506).

Furthermore, to give an overview of interventions that can be effective in improving their quality of life and decrease depressive symptoms. RECENT FINDINGS Quality of life of patients with heart failure and their partners is poor compared with their age-matched peers from the general population and also compared with patients suffering from other chronic diseases. Furthermore, many heart failure patients are depressed. Depressive symptoms of patients and of their partners seem to be interrelated, making interventions complicated but needed. Although the number of studies that specifically target improvement of quality of life and depression in heart failure patients and their partners is still small, several interventions are known to improve quality of life, and these could be implemented in daily care. SUMMARY This review considers demographic and clinical factors that are related to quality of life and depressive symptoms and addresses interventions that can contribute to improvement of quality of life of heart failure patients and their partners and decrease depressive symptoms. Education on self-care management and physical exercise are important elements of disease management programs. A multidisciplinary care approach including optimizing medical therapy and optimal symptom management is advised, focusing both on the patient and the caregiver. Treatment and care should not only focus on heart failure, but also address the consequences of co-morbidities and the side-effects of therapies.","Jaarsma, Tiny; Johansson, Peter; Agren, Susanna; Strömberg, Anna",Current opinion in supportive and palliative care,https://doi.org/10.1097/spc.0b013e328340744d; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20966757/,210

Self-management supported by mobile device applications could improve outcomes for people with COPD. Our aim was to synthesize evidence on the effectiveness of mobile health applications compared with usual care. A systematic review was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials. Outcomes of interest included exacerbations, physical function, and Quality of Life (QoL). Where possible, outcome data were pooled for meta-analyses. Of 1709 citations returned, 13 were eligible trials. Number of exacerbations, quality of life, physical function, dyspnea, physical activity, and self-efficacy were reported. Evidence for effectiveness was inconsistent between studies, and the pooled effect size for physical function and QoL was not significant. There was notable variation in outcome measures used across trials. Developing a standardized outcome-reporting framework for digital health interventions in COPD self-management may help standardize future research.","Shaw, G; Whelan, M E; Armitage, L C; Roberts, N; Farmer, A J",NPJ primary care respiratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41533-020-0167-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32238810/,210

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and technical feasibility of mechanical thrombectomy with the Solitaire AB stent (Covidien, Irvine, CA, USA) for the treatment of acute BAO through a single-center experience. Twenty-one patients with acute BAO were treated with mechanical thrombectomy with the Solitaire AB stent device between 1st September 2011 and 1st December 2014. Recanalization was assessed using the Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) scale system. Clinical outcome was established at discharge by The National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), and the mean time from symptom onset to recanalization determined. Authors had access to identifying information during or after data collection. The clinical status of patients on admission was severe, with a mean NIHSS score of 25.57±5.20 (range: 16-38), and the number of patients with TICI 2b or 3 was 0. The mean time from symptom onset to recanalization was 579.00±188.78min (range: 360-960min). At 3-month follow-up, eight (38.1%) patients had a good clinical outcome. At follow-up, the trial of ORG 10172 in acute stroke treatment (TOAST) classification was large-vessel atherosclerosis in 13 patients (61.9%), cardioembolic in seven patients (33.3%), and undetermined in one patient (4.8%). In our series, application of the Solitaire AB stent retriever in acute BAO resulted in a high recanalization rate without procedural complications, and with good clinical outcome. Further prospective trials are needed to confirm the potential clinical benefit of this treatment approach.","Du, Shiwei; Mao, Gengsheng; Li, Dongmei; Qiu, Ming; Nie, Qingbin; Zhu, Haibo; Yang, Yang; Zhang, Youping; Li, Youxiang; Wu, Zhongxue",Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jocn.2016.01.037; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27312281/,210

Obesity and other components of the metabolic syndrome may aggravate the severity of COVID-19. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome. The aim of this study was to investigate a possible association between MAFLD and COVID-19 severity. METHODS We performed a retrospective, case-control study, enrolling 71 consecutive COVID-19 patients who were divided into two groups according to the presence or absence of fatty liver by computed tomography scan. All medical records of eligible patients were reviewed including demographic, clinical, laboratory parameters and data regarding the presence of NAFLD and COVID-19 severity. RESULTS NAFLD was identified in 22/71 (31%) of the study group. Out of 71, thirteen suffered from severe COVID-19. NAFLD patients had more severe COVID-19 compared with non-NAFLD subjects, 8/22 (36.3%) vs. 5/49(10.2%), (P < 0.005), respectively. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that NAFLD subjects were more likely to have severe COVID-19 disease (odds ratio 3.57, 95% confidence interval: 1.22, 14.48, P = 0.0031). CONCLUSION NAFLD represents a high risk for severe COVID-19 irrespective to gender, and independent of metabolic syndrome specifically in male gender. Moreover, obesity, hypertension and metabolic syndrome were also significantly associated with severe COVID-19.","Mahamid, Mahmud; Nseir, Wiliam; Khoury, Tawfik; Mahamid, Baker; Nubania, Adi; Sub-Laban, Kamal; Schifter, Joel; Mari, Amir; Sbeit, Wisam; Goldin, Eran",European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology,https://doi.org/10.1097/meg.0000000000001902; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32868652/,210

91893,Lack of harmonization of coronavirus disease ordinal scales.,2020-12-15,"X-ray induced acoustic computed tomography (XACT) is a unique hybrid imaging modality that combines high X-ray absorption contrast with high ultrasonic resolution. X-ray radiography and computerized tomography (CT) are currently the gold standards for two-dimensional and three-dimensional imaging of skeletal tissues, though there are important properties of bone, such as elasticity and speed of sound, that these techniques cannot measure. Ultrasound is capable of measuring such properties, though current clinical ultrasound scanners cannot be used to image the interior morphology of bones because they fail to address the complicated physics involved for exact image reconstruction; bone is heterogeneous and composed of layers of both cortical and trabecular bone, which violates assumptions in conventional ultrasound imaging of uniform speed of sound. XACT, in conjunction with the time-reversal algorithm, is capable of generating precise reconstructions, and, by combining elements of both X-ray and ultrasound imaging, XACT is potentially capable of obtaining more information than any single of these techniques at low radiation dose. This paper highlights X-ray-induced acoustic detection through linear scanning of an ultrasound transducer and the time-reversal algorithm to produce the first-ever XACT image of a bone sample. Results of this study should prove to enhance the potential of XACT imaging in the evaluation of bone diseases for future clinical use.","Robertson, Elijah; Samant, Pratik; Wang, Siqi; Tran, Tiffany; Ji, Xuanrong; Xiang, Liangzhong","IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control",https://doi.org/10.1109/tuffc.2020.3032779; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33085608/,210

METHODS The related literatures in the field of CoVs treatment were retrieved from the establishment of Web of Science core collection database to February 15th, 2020, and the literature analysis tool of Web of Science database was used to count the annual trend of published literatures. The VOSviewer software was used to analyze the relationship among countries, institutions, authors, clustering and density of subject words. The HistCite software was used to screen important documents and to draw the evolution process of hot spots. The CiteSpace software was used to analyze the breakout points of subject words, so as to find the front and hot spots in this field. RESULTS A total of 1 747 data were retrieved, with the exception of 17 duplicate data, and 1 730 data were retained for visualization analysis. In terms of literature volume, the literatures on CoVs therapy rose after 2003 and 2012, and the number of published literatures had remained high since 2014. In terms of countries, the main countries that carried out the research on the treatment of CoVs were the United States (n = 613), China (n = 582), Germany (n = 122), Canada (n = 99), etc., and the cooperation among countries was close. In terms of institutions, the number of papers issued by Chinese Academy of Sciences in the field of CoVs treatment ranked first (n = 82), followed by University of Hong Kong of China (n = 74) and Chinese University of Hong Kong of China (n = 58), followed by National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (n = 37), and the cooperation among various institutions was close. In terms of literature authors, there were two high-yielding authors in the United States [Ralph S. Baric (n = 21) and Kuochen Chou (n = 17)], two Chinese authors [Yuen Kwok-yung (n = 17) and Jiang Shibo (n = 16)] and one Dutch author [Eric J. Snijder (n = 17)]. In terms of the cluster analysis of authors, the authors were closely related in reverse genetics, respiratory infection, receptor binding domain, etc., and the 15 top-cited papers came mainly from China, the United States, Netherlands and other countries, and the literature content represented the frontiers and hot spots in different periods. The treatment hot spots focused on preventing virus adsorption, inhibiting the virus gene nucleic acid replication, transcription and translation. The main subject words were divided into three main categories, namely, CoVs epidemiology, basic research and drug development, in which basic research and drug development were strongly correlated. In the subject words breakthrough analysis, there were time-related breakthrough points in 1991, 1996 and 2002, and the ""diagnosis"" and ""sequence"" were continuous hot spots. CONCLUSIONS Through the visualization analysis of knowledge graph, the development trend and hot spots of CoVs therapy research could be well observed. In this study, the degree of attention in the field of CoVs treatment showed periodic changes, related to the outbreak of new CoVs, and the country, institutions and the author were closely related. The treatment hot spots focused on preventing virus adsorption, inhibiting the virus gene nucleic acid replication, transcription and translation in order to develop new targets of drug.","Yi, Wei; Wang, Yu; Tang, Jianqiao; Xiong, Xiaoli; Zhang, Yuesheng; Yan, Suqi",Zhonghua wei zhong bing ji jiu yi xue,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn121430-20200225-00200; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32385990/,210

Droplet sizes predominately determine the times they can remain airborne, the possibility of spread of infectious diseases and thus the strategies for controlling the infections. While significant inconsistencies exist between the existing measured data on respiratory droplets generated during expiratory activities, a food dye was used in the mouth during measurements of large droplets, which made the expiratory activities 'unnatural'. We carried out a series of experiments using glass slides and a microscope as well as an aerosol spectrometer to measure the number and size of respiratory droplets produced from the mouth of healthy individuals during talking and coughing with and without a food dye. The total mass of respiratory droplets was measured using a mask, plastic bag with tissue and an electronic balance with a high precision. Considerable subject variability was observed and the average size of droplets captured using glass slides and microscope was about 50-100 microm. Smaller droplets were also detected by the aerosol spectrometer.

The molecular hybridization approach was based on the combination of 1-benzyl-4-piperidine fragment from the anti-Alzheimer AChE inhibitor donepezil (1) and the cinnamoyl subunit from curcumin (2), a natural product with remarkable antioxidant, neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties, using a N-acylhydrazone fragment as a spacer subunit. Compounds 4a and 4d showed moderate inhibitory activity towards AChE with IC50 values of 13.04 and 9.1 µM, respectively. In addition, compound 4a and 4d showed a similar predicted binding mode to that observed for donepezil in the molecular docking studies. On the other hand, compounds 4a and 4c exhibited significant radical scavenging activity, showing the best effects on the DPPH test and also exhibited a significant protective neuronal cell viability exposed to t-BuOOH and against 6-OHDA insult to prevent the oxidative stress in Parkinson's disease. Similarly, compound 4c was capable to prevent the ROS formation, with indirect antioxidant activity increasing intracellular GSH levels and the ability to counteract the neurotoxicity induced by both OAβ1-42 and 3-NP. In addition, ADMET in silico prediction indicated that both compounds 4a and 4c did not show relevant toxic effects. Due to their above-mentioned biological properties, compounds 4a and 4c could be explored as lead compounds in search of more effective and low toxic small molecules with multiple neuroprotective effects for neurodegenerative diseases.","Ortiz, Cindy Juliet Cristancho; Damasio, Caio Miranda; Pruccoli, Letizia; Nadur, Nathália Fonseca; de Azevedo, Luciana Luiza; Guedes, Isabella Alvim; Dardenne, Laurent Emmanuel; Kümmerle, Arthur Eugen; Tarozzi, Andrea; Viegas, Claudio",Neurochemical research,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11064-020-03148-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33079324/,210

We investigated whether work-related indicators of well-being (i.e. burnout and work engagement) spill-over and generalize to context-free well-being (i.e. depressive symptoms and life satisfaction). More specifically, we examined the causal direction: does burnout/work engagement lead to depressive symptoms/life satisfaction, or the other way around? METHODS Three surveys were conducted. In 2003, 71% of all Finnish dentists were surveyed (n=3255), and the response rate of the 3-year follow-up was 84% (n=2555). The second follow-up was conducted four years later with a response rate of 86% (n=1964). Structural equation modeling was used to investigate the cross-lagged associations between the study variables across time. RESULTS Burnout predicted depressive symptoms and life dissatisfaction from T1 to T2 and from T2 to T3. Conversely, work engagement had a negative effect on depressive symptoms and a positive effect on life satisfaction, both from T1 to T2 and from T2 to T3, even after adjusting for the impact of burnout at every occasion. LIMITATIONS The study was conducted among one occupational group, which limits its generalizability. CONCLUSIONS Work-related well-being predicts general wellbeing in the long-term. For example, burnout predicts depressive symptoms and not vice versa. In addition, burnout and work engagement are not direct opposites. Instead, both have unique, incremental impacts on life satisfaction and depressive symptoms.","Hakanen, Jari J; Schaufeli, Wilmar B",Journal of affective disorders,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2012.02.043; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22445702/,210

One technique, the placement of a Roux limb stabilization suture, presumably prevents kink at the gastrojejunal anastomosis. However, it can have an adverse effect and we studied a series of cases presenting with intestinal obstruction secondary to this stitch. METHODS A retrospective review of a prospectively collected database of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass cases who had reoperations for Roux limb volvulus was performed at a single bariatric center by a single surgeon. RESULTS Out of 199 patients who underwent laparoscopic Roux en Y gastric bypass with placement of Roux limb stabilization suture, 4 patients (2.01%) presented with Roux limb volvulus postoperatively. BMI was 45.35 ± 2.95. The postoperative time to presentation was 11 ± 10.6 months. All four patients required surgical exploration to reduce the volvulus. In all cases, the Roux limb volvulus was directly attributable to the presence of the stabilization suture. In subsequent 250 cases where this suture was eliminated, there was no volvulus of Roux limb seen. CONCLUSIONS The use of a stabilization suture can result in volvulus of the Roux limb causing intestinal obstruction and this complication can be prevented by avoiding this suture.","Marr, Brendan; Yenumula, Panduranga",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-011-0529-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21971630/,210

However, each technology has its own drawbacks. It is difficult to balance the advantages and disadvantages of these internet technologies and identify an optimal solution for the development of medical imaging apps. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to compare different internet platform technologies for remotely viewing radiological images and analyze their advantages and disadvantages. METHODS Oracle Java, Adobe Flash, and HTML5 were each used to develop a comprehensive web-based medical imaging app that connected to a medical image server and provided several required functions for radiological interpretation (eg, navigation, magnification, windowing, and fly-through). Java-, Flash-, and HTML5-based medical imaging apps were tested on different operating systems over a local area network and a wide area network. Three computed tomography colonography data sets and 2 ordinary personal computers were used in the experiment. RESULTS The experimental results demonstrated that Java-, Flash-, and HTML5-based apps had the ability to provide real-time 2D functions. However, for 3D, performances differed between the 3 apps. The Java-based app had the highest frame rate of volume rendering. However, it required the longest time for surface rendering and failed to run surface rendering in macOS. The HTML5-based app had the fastest surface rendering and the highest speed for fly-through without platform dependence. Volume rendering, surface rendering, and fly-through performances of the Flash-based app were significantly worse than those of the other 2 apps. CONCLUSIONS Oracle Java, Adobe Flash, and HTML5 have individual strengths in the development of remote access medical imaging apps.

103492,Evaluation of Routine Blood Tests for Diagnosis of Suspected Coronavirus Disease 2019.,2020-09-01,"BACKGROUND Acute tympanostomy-tube otorrhea is a common sequela in children with tympanostomy tubes. Acute tympanostomy-tube otorrhea is generally a symptom of an acute middle ear infection, whereby middle ear fluid drains through the tube. The widespread use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination (PCV) has changed the bacterial prevalence in the upper respiratory tract of children, but its impact on bacterial and viral pathogens causing acute tympanostomy-tube otorrhea is yet unknown. METHODS This study was performed in the post-PCV7 era parallel to a randomized clinical trial of the clinical and cost-effectiveness of ototopical and systemic antibiotics and initial observation in 230 children aged 1 to 10 years with untreated, uncomplicated acute tympanostomy-tube otorrhea. Otorrhea and nasopharyngeal samples were collected at baseline (before treatment) and at 2 weeks (after treatment). Conventional bacterial culture was performed followed by antimicrobial-resistance assessment. Viruses were identified by polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS At baseline, Haemophilus influenzae (41%), Staphylococcus aureus (40%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (18%) were the most prevalent bacteria in otorrhea, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (7%) and Moraxella catarrhalis (4%). Most pneumococci were non-PCV7 serotypes. Viruses were detected in 45 otorrhea samples at baseline (21%). Most infections were polymicrobial and overall antimicrobial resistance was low. CONCLUSIONS H. influenzae, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa are the most common microorganisms in children with untreated uncomplicated acute tympanostomy-tube otorrhea.

Our aim was to investigate whether FBPJ is feasible and prevents the risk for POPF even after left pancreatectomy (LP). PATIENTS AND METHODS 47 consecutive patients underwent LP. 27 patients were recruited on the basis of CT and, of these, 16 patients were randomized on the basis of findings during surgery (transection line must be left of portal vein, as 2-3 cm pancreatic mobilization is required for FBPJ) to receive either Roux-Y FBPJ or hand-sewn closure of the pancreatic remnant. RESULTS Only 34% (16/47) of the patients met the randomization criteria. Clinically significant POPF rate was higher in FBPJ group (60%) compared to thand-sewn closure group (13%; P<0.05). POPF rate in FBPJ group was higher even when compared to all patients with hand-sewn closure (60% versus 37%; P<0.05). Overall, FBPJ was technically feasible for only 28% of patients. CONCLUSION FBPJ cannot be recommended for the routine closure of the pancreatic remnant after LP, as it was not technically achievable in 72% of the cases. Moreover, the technique does not seem to reduce the risk for POPF compared to the hand-sewn closure.","Antila, Anne; Sand, Juhani; Nordback, Isto; Räty, Sari; Laukkarinen, Johanna",BioMed research international,https://doi.org/10.1155/2014/508714; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25013787/,210

Although the benefits of running are numerous, there is a risk of Running Related Injuries (RRIs) of the lower extremities. Electromyography (EMG) techniques have previously been used to study causes of RRIs, but the complexity of this technology limits its use to a laboratory setting. As running is primarily an outdoors activity, this lack of technology acts as a barrier to the study of RRIs in natural environments. This study presents a minimally invasive wearable muscle sensing device consisting of jogging leggings with embroidered surface EMG (sEMG) electrodes capable of recording muscle activity data of the quadriceps group. To test the use of the device, a proof of concept study consisting of N = 2 runners performing a set of 5 km running trials is presented in which the effect of running surfaces on muscle fatigue, a potential cause of RRIs, is evaluated. Results show that muscle fatigue can be analysed from the sEMG data obtained through the wearable device, and that running on soft surfaces (such as sand) may increase the likelihood of suffering from RRIs.","Ribas Manero, R B; Shafti, A; Michael, B; Grewal, J; Ribas Fernandez, J Ll; Althoefer, K; Howard, M J",Conference proceedings : ...

METHODS An online survey was completed by 1500 men and women, aged 60 or above, from the general community in Japan. When responding to questions regarding motivation for participating in dementia prevention activities and providing support to people with dementia, respondents were randomly assigned different incentive conditions. Two incentive options were used for dementia prevention activities (no incentives, and a small number of reward points). Three incentive options were used for support activities (no incentives, a small cash reward, or an in-kind time reward that allowed respondents or their family members to use similar services at a later time (time credits)). RESULTS Financial incentives decreased motivation for participating in dementia prevention activities, while time credits significantly increased motivation to participate in providing support to people with dementia for going out of their home, when receiving a cash reward was compared with receiving no reward. No significant differences by incentive were found for participating in daily living support for those with dementia or for providing support at a dementia café where people with dementia and their families interact. CONCLUSIONS The adverse influence of financial incentives on motivation to participate in dementia prevention suggested that financial incentives may reduce intrinsic motivation for dementia prevention activities. The positive effects of time credits in providing support to people with dementia in going out suggested that time credits might be effective for some support activities for people with dementia. Different incentive measures should be considered to raise awareness of dementia prevention and dementia support activities.","Takao, Makiko; Maki, Yohko; Suzuki, Takao",Psychogeriatrics : the official journal of the Japanese Psychogeriatric Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/psyg.12688; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33754416/,210

Cold water ingestion is a simple cooling strategy, but its efficacy for prolonging exercise capacity with MS remains undetermined. We sought to identify whether cold water ingestion blunts exercise-induced rises in body temperature and improves exercise tolerance in heat-sensitive individuals with MS. METHODS On two separate occasions, 20 participants (10 relapsing-remitting MS (expanded disability status scale, 2-4.5); 10 age-matched healthy controls) cycled at ∼40% V˙O2max at 30°C and 30% relative humidity until volitional exhaustion (or a maximum of 60 min). Every 15 min, participants ingested 3.2 mL·kg of either 1.5°C (CLD) or 37°C (NEU) water. Rectal (Tre) temperature, mean skin (Tsk) temperature, and heart rate (HR) were measured throughout. RESULTS All 10 controls but only 3 of 10 MS participants completed 60 min of exercise in NEU trial. The remaining 7 MS participants all cycled longer (P = 0.006) in CLD (46.4 ± 14.2 min) compared with NEU (32.7 ± 11.5 min), despite a similar absolute Tre (NEU: 37.32°C ± 0.34°C; CLD: 37.28°C ± 0.26°C; P = 0.44), change in Tre (NEU: 0.38°C ± 0.21°C; CLD: 0.34°C ± 0.24°C), absolute Tsk (NEU: 34.48°C ± 0.47°C; CLD: 34.44°C ± 0.54°C; P = 0.82), and HR (NEU: 114 ± 20 bpm; CLD: 113 ± 18 bpm; P = 0.38) for the same exercise volume. CONCLUSIONS Cold water ingestion enhanced exercise tolerance of MS participants in the heat by ∼30% despite no differences in Tre, Tsk or HR. These findings support the use of a simple cooling strategy for mitigating heat intolerance with MS and lend insight into the potential role of cold-afferent thermoreceptors that reside in the abdomen and oral cavity in the modulation of exercise tolerance with MS in the heat.","Chaseling, Georgia K; Filingeri, Davide; Barnett, Michael; Hoang, Phu; Davis, Scott L; Jay, Ollie",Medicine and science in sports and exercise,https://doi.org/10.1249/mss.0000000000001496; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29140896/,210
117172,Adaptive support ventilation: an appropriate mechanical ventilation strategy for acute respiratory distress syndrome?,2009,"The development of effective vaccines that can be rapidly manufactured and distributed worldwide is necessary to mitigate the devastating health and economic impacts of pandemics like COVID-19. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which mediates host cell entry of the virus, is an appealing antigen for subunit vaccines because it is efficient to manufacture, highly stable, and a target for neutralizing antibodies. Unfortunately, RBD is poorly immunogenic. While most subunit vaccines are commonly formulated with adjuvants to enhance their immunogenicity, clinically-relevant adjuvants Alum, AddaVax, and CpG/Alum are found unable to elicit neutralizing responses following a prime-boost immunization. Here, it has been shown that sustained delivery of an RBD subunit vaccine comprising CpG/Alum adjuvant in an injectable polymer-nanoparticle (PNP) hydrogel elicited potent anti-RBD and anti-spike antibody titers, providing broader protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern compared to bolus administration of the same vaccine and vaccines comprising other clinically-relevant adjuvant systems. Notably, a SARS-CoV-2 spike-pseudotyped lentivirus neutralization assay revealed that hydrogel-based vaccines elicited potent neutralizing responses when bolus vaccines did not. Together, these results suggest that slow delivery of RBD subunit vaccines with PNP hydrogels can significantly enhance the immunogenicity of RBD and induce neutralizing humoral immunity.","Gale, Emily C; Powell, Abigail E; Roth, Gillie A; Meany, Emily L; Yan, Jerry; Ou, Ben S; Grosskopf, Abigail K; Adamska, Julia; Picece, Vittoria C T M; d'Aquino, Andrea I; Pulendran, Bali; Kim, Peter S; Appel, Eric A",Advanced materials,https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202104362; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34651342/,210
118243,[A case of cerebral embolism with Coronavirus disease 2019].,2021-06-18,"The sensitive detection of coronavirus is of vital importance for the prevention of its rapid spread. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a highly contagious coronavirus that causes severe diarrhea and death in neonatal piglets. In this work, a novel PCN-224-based electrochemiluminescence (ECL) system was constructed for PEDV detection with high sensitivity. We found that PCN-224 can be employed as an ECL reporter with a strong signal because of its zirconium-based organic porous frame nanomaterial with a large specific surface area and stable structure. TiO2 nanoparticles were used as an accelerator for the first time to promote the reduction of coreactant potassium peroxydisulfate on the cathode; thus, the initial ECL signal of PCN-224 was significantly amplified. In the presence of PEDV, the ECL signal decreased due to the block effect to electron transfer. As a result, the novel ""signal off"" biosensor achieved a sensitive detection of PEDV ranging from 1 pg/mL to 10 ng/mL, with a detection limit of 0.4 pg/mL (S/N = 3). Importantly, the PCN-224 nanomaterial enriched the ECL system in biological analysis, and the proposed strategy provided a new route for coronavirus detection.","Ma, Jing; Wang, Wenjing; Li, Yun; Lu, Zhicheng; Tan, Xuecai; Han, Heyou",Analytical chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c03836; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33435685/,210
120877,Optimal inflammatory bowel disease management during the global coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.,2021-04-14,"Continuous addition of undesired effluents to the environment affects foliar surface of leaf, changes their morphology, stomata, photosynthetic pigments, and biochemical constituents which result in massive damage due to persistent nature of the pollutant. In persistent hostile environment, plants fail to grow and develop, and the effects are often extensive. In current study, landscape plants were exposed to different levels of road dust to analyze the effect on various photosynthetic pigments. Dry roadside sediments were collected through a vacuum pump and passed through filters to get fine particles less than 100 μm and sprinkled on Euphorbia milii (EM), Gardenia jasminoides (GJ), and Hibiscus rosa-sinensis (HRs) by using a hand pump, twice daily at T1 (control), T2, T3, and T4 (0, 2, 4, and 6 g/plant, respectively) for a period of 3 months in green house. Road sediment significantly reduces leaf pigments in landscape plants population and the effects were more severe in high level of dust deposition. Individual response of EM, GJ, and HRs to different levels of road dust was variable; however, road sediment significantly reduces leaf pigments at high dose of roadside dust deposition. EM plants exposed to 2 g/plant roadside dust showed higher chlorophyll-a, chlorophyll-b, total chlorophyll, chlorophyllide-b, and polar carotenoid contents as compared to GJ and HRs. Leaf chlorophyll-a, chlorophyll-b, total chlorophyll, carotenoid, and polar carotenoid contents of EM were higher than GJ and HRs in T3 and T4 treatments. However HRs showed significantly higher protochlorophyllide, chlorophyllide-a, and pheophytin-b contents of leaf in T4 group. EM was found as tolerant landscape plant followed by HRs. GJ was most vulnerable to road dust stress. Present study concludes that the entire biosynthesis of leaf pigments is in chain and interlinked together where effect of road dust on one pigment influences other pigments and their derivatives. Salient features of the present study provide useful evidence to estimate roadside dust as a major risk factor for plant pigments, and plants in green belt along roadside suffer retarded growth and fail to establish and develop.","Shah, Kamran; Amin, Noor Ul; Ahmad, Imran; Ara, Gulshan",Environmental science and pollution research international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-018-2309-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29860685/,210
121327,"Reply to ""Anticoagulant treatment is associated with decreased mortality in severe coronavirus disease 2019 patients with coagulopathy"".",2020-04-17,"Sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] is an important food crop with a diverse gene pool residing in its wild relatives. A total of 15 sorghum accessions from the unexploited wild gene pool of the Sorghum genus, representing the five subgenera, were sequenced, and the complete chloroplast genomes and 99 common single-copy concatenated nuclear genes were assembled. Annotation of the chloroplast genomes identified a total of 81 protein-coding genes, 38 tRNA, and four rRNA genes. The gene content and gene order among the species was identical. A total of 153 nonsynonymous amino acid changes in 40 genes were identified across the species. Phylogenetic analysis of both the whole chloroplast genome and nuclear genes revealed a similar topology with two distinct clades within the genus. The species within the subgenera Eusorghum, Chaetosorghum, and Heterosorghum clustered in one clade, whereas the species within the subgenera Parasorghum and Stiposorghum clustered in a second clade. However, the subgenera Parasorghum and Stiposorghum were not monophyletic, suggesting the need for further research to resolve the relationships within this group. The close relationship between the two monotypic subgenera Chaetosorghum and Heterosorghum suggests that species within these subgenera could be considered as one group. This analysis provides an improved understanding of the genetic relationships within the Sorghum genus and defines diversity in wild sorghum species that may be useful for crop improvement.","Ananda, Galaihalage; Norton, Sally; Blomstedt, Cecilia; Furtado, Agnelo; Møller, Birger; Gleadow, Roslyn; Henry, Robert",The plant genome,https://doi.org/10.1002/tpg2.20123; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34323394/,210

METHODS From October 1, 2012, through June 30, 2014, 60 donor nephrectomies were performed by a single surgeon who lacked experience with laparoscopic renal surgery: the first 30 by HALDN and the last 30 by PLDN. Operative and convalescence parameters were compared, as were intra- and postoperative complications within 90 days according to the Satava and Clavien-Dindo classifications, respectively. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the association of baseline characteristics with complications. RESULTS Baseline characteristics were similar in the 2 groups, except for American Society of Anesthesiologists score II (10.0% vs 43.3%; P = .007). All procedures were completed as planned. All operative and convalescence parameters of donors and graft outcomes were similar in the 2 groups, as were overall rates of intraoperative (43.3% vs 36.7%, P = .598) and postoperative (86.7% vs 70.0%; P = .209) complications. No factor was significantly predictive of intraoperative complications, whereas sex (female vs male, odds ratio, 0.183; P = .029) and learning curve (odds ratio, 0.602; P = .036) were significant determinants of postoperative complication. CONCLUSION The technical transition from HALDN to PLDN does not involve a steep learning curve for surgeons less experienced with laparoscopic renal surgery and maintains similar perioperative donor and graft outcomes.","You, Dalsan; Lee, Chunwoo; Jeong, In Gab; Han, Duck Jong; Hong, Bumsik",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.4293/jsls.2015.00044; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26229420/,210

From the reported cases in the literatures, the level of D-dimer in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is positively correlated with the severity of illness, which needs the attention of clinical workers. According to Western medicine, the increase of D-dimer is related to the hyperactivity of fibrinolytic system and the shortening of prothrombin time (PT), resulting in excessive production and degradation of plasma fibrin and hypercoagulable state of blood, while traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) believes that the above syndromes belong to the pathogenesis of ""blood stasis"" according to TCM theories. Over the years, TCM has a significant effect on promoting blood circulation, removing blood stasis and improving microcirculation.

Current CF treatment strategies are focused on targeted drug delivery to the lungs. Novel inhalable drug therapies require an in vitro CF model that appropriately mimics the in vivo CF lung environment to better understand drug delivery and transport across the CF epithelium, and predict drug therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, the aim of this research was to determine the appropriate air-liquid interface (ALI) culture method of the CuFi-1 (CF cell line) compared to the NuLi-1 (healthy cell line) cells to be used as in vitro models of CF airway epithelia. Furthermore, drug transport on both CuFi-1 and NuLi-1 was investigated to determine whether these cell lines could be used to study transport of drugs used in CF treatment using Ibuprofen (the only anti-inflammatory drug currently approved for CF) as a model drug. Differentiating characteristics specific to airway epithelia such as mucus production, inflammatory response and tight junction formation at two seeding densities (Low and High) were assessed throughout an 8-week ALI culture period. This study demonstrated that both the NuLi-1 and CuFi-1 cell lines fully differentiate in ALI culture with significant mucus secretion, IL-6 and IL-8 production, and functional tight junctions at week 8. Additionally, the High seeding density was found to alter the phenotype of the NuLi-1 cell line. For the first time, this study identifies that ibuprofen is transported via the paracellular pathway in ALI models of NuLi-1 and CuFi-1 cell lines. Overall, these findings highlight that NuLi-1 and CuFi-1 as promising in vitro ALI models to investigate the transport properties of novel inhalable drug therapies for CF treatment.","Sheikh, Zara; Bradbury, Peta; Pozzoli, Michele; Young, Paul M; Xin Ong, Hui; Traini, Daniela",European journal of pharmaceutics and biopharmaceutics : official journal of Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Pharmazeutische Verfahrenstechnik e.V,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejpb.2020.09.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32916267/,210

However, it is still a matter of debate whether the lead extraction procedure is a safe treatment choice in the elderly. METHODS We collected the clinical information from 3,810 patients undergoing TLE in 2 high-volume centers (Poland and Italy) between 2006 and 2017. We tested risk factors, effectiveness, safety and long-term survival in 3 groups of patients: those aged 80-89.99 years, ≥90 years and 30-79.99 years. RESULTS Lower BMI, lower levels of hemoglobin and more comorbidities characterized the patients, whose ages ranged from 80 to 89.99 years. Those aged ≥90 years most often had single-chamber pacemakers. Octogenarians and nonagenarians were more often undergoing TLE due to infectious indications (57.19 and 74.29 vs. 45.35% in younger individuals). Lead age and the number of leads extracted were comparable in the 3 groups. In octogenarians, leads were more often removed using standard extraction techniques: simple traction and mechanical dilatators, whereas in nonagenarians TLE was more complex. The duration of the procedure was shorter in older patients, while clinical and procedural effectiveness was similar to that in younger individuals. The rate of major complications related to TLE did not differ between octogenarians and younger subjects (2.0 vs. 1.38%, p = ns), and the number of procedure-related risk factors was smaller in older people. Nonagenarians did not develop any major complication related to TLE. Long-term mortality after TLE was similar among octogenarians and nonagenarians (39.67 and 40.00%) but higher than in younger patients (24.41; p < 0.001 and 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Lead extraction procedures appear effective and safe in octogenarians and nonagenarians, comparable to younger individuals. Procedure-related risk in the elderly is not associated with most of the typical risk factors encountered in younger subjects, but only with the higher number of pacemaker, implantable cardiac defibrillator and cardiac resynchronization therapy device procedures before TLE. Long-term survival after TLE was found to be similar among octogenarians and nonagenarians being about 60% at over 3 years of follow-up. Age alone should not be considered a risk factor for the occurrence of major complications or procedure-related death, and therefore it should not prevent candidacy for TLE.","Jacheć, Wojciech; Polewczyk, Anna; Segreti, Luca; Bongiorni, Maria Grazia; Kutarski, Andrzej",Gerontology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000511358; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33242867/,210

METHODS This cross-sectional descriptive study involved 28 residents from the Department of Paediatrics at the University of São Paulo. The functional MRI was carried out while the residents completed the Stroop colour word task paradigm to investigate their attentional task performance. The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) was applied, and stress was assessed using the Lipp Inventory of Stress Symptoms for Adults and by a visual analogue mood scale. RESULTS The MBI subscales of depersonalisation and emotional exhaustion indicated that 53.1% of the residents had moderate or high burnout syndrome. The whole-brain multivariate analysis showed positive correlations between the blood oxygenation level dependent effect and the MBI depersonalisation and emotional exhaustion indices in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which controls for anxiety. CONCLUSION Increased brain activation during an attention task, measured using functional MRI, was associated with higher burnout scores in paediatric residents.

A total of 132 completely healthy piglets were randomly divided into 22 groups consisting of six animals each. Control piglets were intramuscularly injected with 2 ml of PRRSV (NJGC strain) solution containing 106 TCID50 virus/ml. For low-, middle- and high-dose saponin treatment groups, the piglets were initially administrated with the same volume of PRRSV solution, followed by intraperitoneal injection with AB4, PNS, SR1, SSA or SSD at 1, 5 or 10 mg/kg b.w. on day 3. The piglets in drug control group were intraperitoneally injected with 10 mg/kg b.w. of each saponin without prior PRRS challenge, while those in blank control group were injected with the same amount of normal saline. The results indicated that all the five saponin components could decrease the incidence and severity of PRRSV-induced immunopathological damages, including the elevated body temperature, weight loss, anaemia and internal inflammation. Moreover, the saponin components could enhance protein absorption and immune responses. Taken together, this study reveals that the saponin components are effective against PRRSV infection and strengthen the immune system and thus may serve as potential antiviral therapeutic agents.","Hu, Yiyi; Zhang, Bicheng; Wang, Wei; Zhou, Jinzhu; Li, Bin; He, Kongwang",Journal of animal physiology and animal nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1111/jpn.13302; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31898833/,210

RESULTS We identified 4 cases of PSMs after RARC in published studies and also included our case for analysis. All 5 patients had muscle-invasive bladder cancer at cystectomy (stage ≥ T2) and 3 had local lymph node-positive disease. Our aggressive treatment of chemotherapy, wide surgical excision of PSM, and radiotherapy provided our patient with a 2-year disease-free status. CONCLUSION PSMs are a rare event in RARC, with only 4 other cases reported in published studies. The outcomes have not been well reported for these cases. We propose that multimodality treatment consisting of salvage chemotherapy, surgery, and radiotherapy should be considered, although concessions could be needed after consideration of patient factors.","Khetrapal, Pramit; Tan, Wei Shen; Lamb, Benjamin; Nathan, Senthil; Briggs, Tim; Shankar, Arjun; Ramachandran, Navin; Freeman, Alex; Mitra, Anita; Kelly, John D",Clinical genitourinary cancer,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clgc.2016.06.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28209455/,210

137527,Coronavirus disease 2019 infection in patients with recent cardiac surgery: does chronic anticoagulant therapy have a protective effect?,2020-10-01,"Coronaviruses express two very large replicase polyproteins, the 16 autoproteolytic cleavage products of which collectively form the membrane-anchored replication complexes. How these structures are assembled is still largely unknown, but it is likely that the membrane-spanning members of these nonstructural proteins (nsps) are responsible for the induction of the double-membrane vesicles and for anchoring the replication complexes to these membranes. For 3 of the 16 coronavirus nsps-nsp3, nsp4, and nsp6-multiple transmembrane domains are predicted. Previously we showed that, consistent with predictions, nsp4 occurs in membranes with both of its termini exposed in the cytoplasm (M. Oostra et al., J. Virol. 81:12323-12336, 2007). Strikingly, however, for both nsp3 and nsp6, predictions based on a multiple alignment of 27 coronavirus genome sequences indicate an uneven number of transmembrane domains. As a consequence, the proteinase domains present in nsp3 and nsp5 would be separated from their target sequences by the lipid bilayer. To look into this incongruity, we studied the membrane disposition of nsp3 and nsp6 of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and murine hepatitis virus by analyzing tagged forms of the proteins expressed in cultured cells. Contrary to the predictions, in both viruses, both proteins had their amino terminus, as well as their carboxy terminus, exposed in the cytoplasm. We established that two of the three hydrophobic domains in nsp3 and six of the seven in nsp6 are membrane spanning. Subsequently, we verified that in nsp4, all four hydrophobic domains span the lipid bilayer. The occurrence of conserved non-membrane-spanning hydrophobic domains in nsp3 and nsp6 suggests an important function for these domains in coronavirus replication.","Oostra, Monique; Hagemeijer, Marne C; van Gent, Michiel; Bekker, Cornelis P J; te Lintelo, Eddie G; Rottier, Peter J M; de Haan, Cornelis A M",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01219-08; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18842706/,210

The COVID-19 pandemic has and is still greatly affecting elder populations as well as those across the age continuum living with long-standing chronic conditions or with pre-existing diverse unmet needs. While health promotion and palliative care may appear to be conceptually opposing fields, we argue that palliative care can and should fit under the umbrella of the health promotion continuum. This commentary seeks to discuss the importance of linguistic literacy and communication imperatives in the context of access to palliative care, given the broad, diversified and sensitive scope of care. While the pandemic has demonstrated that the public health responses of migrant host societies are deeply intertwined with policies as well as local rules and constraints, the promotion and provision of safe, timely and appropriate palliative care can be achieved through a sensitive assessment of differential contexts of diversity. The pandemic has painfully illustrated the need for a strong, respectful and equitable working partnership within the professions as well as with the civic society in order for the palliative needs of those exposed to a sustained risk not to be forgotten.","Vissandjée, Bilkis; Fernandez, Isabel; Durivage, Patrick; Freitas, Zelda; Savignac, Paule; Van Pevenage, Isabelle",Global health promotion,https://doi.org/10.1177/1757975921989995; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33622087/,210

In this group, healthcare students, especially nursing undergraduates, have even higher risk to be exposed and suffered a contagious accident. One of the main pillars to prevent exposure to such pathogens and decrease accidents seems to be through education. A prospective observational educational research focused on quantifying the students' knowledge, and prevention culture was carried out. The educational approach based on the development of a technological tool, its integration in the students' education, and posterior assessment. The Chi-square, ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, Man-Whitney U, and Spearman correlations were used to determine the effect of such educational methodology. The results, previous to the integration of the educational approach, showed differences between the elementary and proficient knowledge and correct procedure in each academic year (p < 0.05), being the best year the third academic year. The mean of elementary knowledge among second year students after the inclusion of the educational methodology improved for 2017/2018 with a mean of 7.5 (1.11) and in 2018/2019 with 7.87 (1.34).

University students are additionally burdened by the transition to distance e-learning. The aims of the study were to investigate the prevalence of anxiety and depression in university students and to identify associated risk factors. DESIGN AND METHODS An online questionnaire was administered to 2,009 students in the University of Patras, Greece, during the national lockdown. Socio-demographic, academic data, and the forced disruption of daily life were assessed along with the Greek version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. RESULTS Anxiety and depression prevalence was 35.8% and 51.2% respectively. Age, school of study, financial status, self-perceived health status, level of satisfaction with the state's and university's response and specific aspects in the daily routine were associated with both anxiety and depression scores. At higher odds of both depression and anxiety were students with low income, bad health status, annoyed at staying home and those who encountered difficulties with the online education system. Additional risk factors for depression were studies in humanities and social sciences, and low satisfaction with the university's response, while for anxiety were studies in agricultural sciences and absence of information about COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS The proportion of Greek students showing depression and anxiety, during the restrictive measures, is alarming. Mental health in university students should be monitored. Mitigation strategies should focus on specific personal, academic and social variables that have been identified as protective factors.","Sazakli, Eleni; Leotsinidis, Michalis; Bakola, Maria; Kitsou, Konstantina Soultana; Katsifara, Amalia; Konstantopoulou, Ariadni; Jelastopulu, Eleni",Journal of public health research,https://doi.org/10.4081/jphr.2021.2089; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33960758/,210

MATERIALS AND METHODS This HIPAA-compliant study was approved by the institutional review board; informed consent waived. Retrospective analysis of the 65-79-year-old cohort (n = 577) from the University of Wisconsin CT colonography screening program (n = 5176) was undertaken. Performance and outcome measures including advanced neoplasia prevalence and colonoscopy referral, extracolonic finding, extracolonic work-up, and complication rates were obtained by using a CT colonography database and review of medical records. Comparisons between the older cohort and the general screening population were made by using the Student t, Pearson chi(2), and Fisher exact tests. A P value <or= .05 was considered to indicate a significant difference. RESULTS With a 6-mm threshold for positivity, the overall referral rate to optical colonoscopy was 15.3% (88 of 577), leading to 277 polypectomies and the removal of 103 nondiminutive adenomas. For adenomas, the per-patient positivity rates were 10.9% (63 of 577) and 6.8% (39 of 577) at the 6- and 10-mm thresholds, respectively. The prevalence of advanced neoplasia was 7.6% (44 of 577). Fifty-four adenomas met advanced status, and five unsuspected cancers were detected. The advanced neoplasias identified were typically large, with a mean size of 21 mm. Potentially important extracolonic findings were seen in 15.4% (89 of 577) of patients, with a work-up rate of 7.8% (45 of 577). The majority of important extracolonic diagnoses were vascular aneurysms (n = 18). No major complications were encountered. CONCLUSION CT colonography is a safe and effective screening modality for the older population.","Kim, David H; Pickhardt, Perry J; Hanson, Meghan E; Hinshaw, J Louis",Radiology,https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.09091478; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20093521/,210

However, a crescent wave of anti-vaccine groups has grown in Western countries, especially in Italy, in the last two decades. Our aim was to evaluate adult's hesitancy and knowledge about vaccines and related diseases in Trentino-Alto Adige -the Italian region with the lowest vaccination coverages. METHODS We administered self-answered structured questionnaires in three malls in the Trentino province in June 2019. We collected demographic data and information on knowledge about vaccines, infectious diseases and attitude in seeking health information. We utilized a descriptive and multivariate analysis to investigate factors associated with vaccine hesitancy. RESULTS We collected 567 questionnaires, 18% of the people interviewed were hesitant toward vaccination and 16% were against mandatory vaccination. In the multivariate analysis a poor level of information, being younger than 60 years and being against compulsory vaccination were associated with vaccine hesitancy. Regarding information about vaccines, 76.5% of the people relied on physicians, and/or 49% navigated the internet, while social media are used by 16% of the study population. Though 41.5% searched information on official sites, only 14% knew the website VaccinarSì and 4.7% had visited it. DISCUSSION Compared to a previous study conducted in all of Italy except Trentino Alto Adige, the level of vaccination hesitancy was higher. It is important to utilize health professionals, the internet and especially social media to spread scientific information about vaccination.","Melot, Bénédicte; Bordin, Paola; Bertoni, Caterina; Tralli, Valentina; Zuccali, Mariagrazia; Grignolio, Andrea; Majori, Silvia; Ferro, Antonio",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2020.1763085; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32530773/,210

As the technique becomes more widespread, questions regarding its safety, feasibility, and reproducibility must be addressed. This review assesses the current status of LSD. METHODS We conducted our literature review with a search of the PubMed database. All published series of 5 or more laparoscopic splenectomy and azygoportal disconnection procedures were examined. The demographic, intraoperative, and postoperative data analyzed included number of ports, conversion rate, operative duration, estimated intraoperative blood loss, postoperative hospital stay, and complications. RESULTS Fifteen articles met the review criteria. Of 412 laparoscopic procedures, traditional laparoscopic splenectomy and azygoportal disconnection (TLSD) was used in 322 patients (78.2%), a modified laparoscopic procedure (MLSD) in 79 (19.2%), and a single-incision laparoscopic procedure (SLSD) in 11 (2.7%). Compared with the traditional and single-incision laparoscopic procedures, the MLSD procedure was associated with shorter operative duration and less blood loss. Furthermore, although the incidence of postoperative portal vein system thrombosis was higher in the laparoscopic than in the open splenectomy with azygoportal disconnection (OSD) procedure, the LSD procedure was associated with less pulmonary infection and pleural effusion and fewer incisional and overall complications than the open procedure. The rate of conversion to an open procedure was 5.4%. CONCLUSIONS LSD is feasible and safe for selected patients when performed by an expert laparoscopic surgeon. It has perioperative advantages over OSD, but studies with longer follow-up periods and larger samples of patients are needed.","Jiang, Guo-Qing; Bai, Dou-Sheng; Chen, Ping; Qian, Jian-Jun; Jin, Sheng-Jie",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.4293/jsls.2015.00091; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26941546/,210

151486,"Evidence, not eminence, in coronavirus disease 2019.",2020-09-01,"PURPOSE Temporary COVID-19 guideline recommendations have recently been issued to expand the use of colony-stimulating factors in patients with cancer with intermediate to high risk for febrile neutropenia (FN). We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of primary prophylaxis (PP) with biosimilar filgrastim-sndz in patients with intermediate risk of FN compared with secondary prophylaxis (SP) over three different cancer types. METHODS A Markov decision analytic model was constructed from the US payer perspective over a lifetime horizon to evaluate PP versus SP in patients with breast cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Cost-effectiveness was evaluated over a range of willingness-to-pay thresholds for incremental cost per FN avoided, life year gained, and quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Sensitivity analyses evaluated uncertainty. RESULTS Compared with SP, PP provided an additional 0.102-0.144 LYs and 0.065-0.130 QALYs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ranged from $5,660 in US dollars (USD) to $20,806 USD per FN event avoided, $5,123 to $31,077 USD per life year gained, and $7,213 to $35,563 USD per QALY gained. Over 1,000 iterations, there were 73.6%, 99.4%, and 91.8% probabilities that PP was cost-effective at a willingness to pay of $50,000 USD per QALY gained for breast cancer, NSCLC, and NHL, respectively. CONCLUSION PP with a biosimilar filgrastim (specifically filgrastim-sndz) is cost-effective in patients with intermediate risk for FN receiving curative chemotherapy regimens for breast cancer, NSCLC, and NHL. Expanding the use of colony-stimulating factors for patients may be valuable in reducing unnecessary health care visits for patients with cancer at risk of complications because of COVID-19 and should be considered for the indefinite future.","Li, Edward; Mezzio, Dylan J; Campbell, David; Campbell, Kim; Lyman, Gary H",JCO oncology practice,https://doi.org/10.1200/op.20.01047; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33793342/,210

Decrease of lipids and triacylglycerol accumulation in differentiated 3T3-L1 cells were in concordance with downregulation of the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPβ/α), and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c). Furthermore, regulation of PPARγ-mediated β-lactamase expression by V. opulus components in reporter gene assay, as well as their binding affinity to ligand-binding domain of PPARγ, were tested. In addition, the levels of enzymes involved in lipid metabolism, like fatty acid synthase (FAS) or acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), were decreased, along with inflammatory cytokines, like tumor necrosis factorα (TNFα), interleukin-6 (Il-6) and leptin. Moreover, FJ and PJ were able to inhibit pancreatic lipase, which potentially could reduce the fat absorption from the intestinal lumen and the storage of body fat in the adipose tissues. Thirty-two phenolic compounds with chlorogenic acid as the dominant compound were identified in PJ which revealed significant biological activity. These data contribute to elucidate V. opulus juice phenolic compounds' molecular mechanism in adipogenesis regulation in 3T3-L1 cells and dietary fat lipolysis.","Zakłos-Szyda, Małgorzata; Pietrzyk, Nina; Szustak, Marcin; Podsędek, Anna",Nutrients,https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12072003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32640537/,210

The analysis focuses on the effects of racial residential segregation on mortality and infection rates for the overall population and on racial and ethnic mortality gaps. To account for potential confounding, I assemble a dataset that includes 50 county-level factors that are potentially related to residential segregation and COVID-19 infection and mortality rates. These factors are grouped into eight categories: demographics, density and potential for public interaction, social capital, health risk factors, capacity of the health care system, air pollution, employment in essential businesses, and political views. I use double-lasso regression, a machine learning method for model selection and inference, to select the most important controls in a statistically principled manner. Counties that are 1 SD above the racial segregation mean have experienced mortality and infection rates that are 8% and 5% higher than the mean. These differences represent an average of four additional deaths and 105 additional infections for each 100,000 residents in the county. The analysis of mortality gaps shows that, in counties that are 1 SD above the Black-White segregation mean, the Black mortality rate is 8% higher than the White mortality rate. Sensitivity analyses show that an unmeasured confounder that would overturn these findings is outside the range of plausible covariates.","Torrats-Espinosa, Gerard",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2015577118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33531345/,210

The aim of this quality improvement project was to improve patient communication with relatives, thereby enhancing their recovery and experience.MethodIn-patients at St Mary’s Hospital, London were asked if they were able to contact their loved ones and if there was appropriate technology available to facilitate this. Teaching was then delivered to healthcare professionals highlighting the importance of patient communication with friends and family, and posters were displayed to promote communication opportunities. Additional equipment was procured (through donations) to aid the process. A second data collection was conducted after 3 weeks.ResultsThe initial results revealed that 30% of patients were unable to communicate with their relatives, and only 16.6% were being offered the opportunity to contact them. Comments following the initial data collection included: ‘I feel isolated because my family can’t visit, and I don’t have a mobile phone’, and, ‘the ward staff are too busy to call my family on the ward phone’. After the intervention 73.3% were offered the opportunity to contact relatives. There was a significant increase in use of the ward phone and video calls. This had an increase in both patient and family satisfaction;for example, a patient was able to ask a friend to deliver their belongings, and a daughter of a patient with dementia was able to encourage him to eat via a video call.ConclusionProactive use of technologies in healthcare settings can improve patient care. Organising a teaching session, obtaining equipment, and encouraging healthcare workers to facilitate these important moments during an in-patient stay can have a dramatic impact on both patients’ and their relatives’ wellbeing.","Hawkins, Sophie Chandler Eleanor Koizia Louis",BMJ Leader,https://doi.org/10.1136/leader-2020-fmlm.13,210

Regarding the course in children and adolescents, however, reliable data are not yet available. Objective: 380 children and adolescents/young adults aged between 6 and 21 years, being treated for various psychiatric diseases in an outpatient clinical service, were examined for COVID-19 infections and Long COVID symptoms following a structured protocol. Results: Three patients had COVID-19; one patient had symptoms of Long COVID in his medical histo-ry, but they could not be objectivized in an in-depth neuropsychiatric and neuropsychological assessment. Conclusions: Long COVID seems to occur rarely in children and adolescents.

Given the recent rapid rise in virtual care and research, clinicians and researchers require guidance on best practices for virtual administration of these tools. We informally reviewed the extant literature, and conducted semi-structured interviews with a group of 12 clinicians, students and researchers who had administered standardized language and literacy assessments with typically developing children between the ages of four and eight, in a virtual setting. Six themes: candidacy for virtual assessment, communication and collaboration with caregivers, technology and equipment, virtual administration, ethics, consent and confidentiality, and special considerations for bilingual populations were discussed, to develop a set of recommendations to guide the use of standardized assessments in a virtual setting. In line with the Guidelines International Network, these recommendations were rated by group members, and reviewed by external stakeholders. This paper is one of the first to share recommended practices for virtual assessment in the domain of oral language assessment. As research on the reliability of virtual assessment in this realm is still scarce, we hope the current recommendations will facilitate future clinical research in this area, and in turn will lead to the development of formal Clinical Practice Guidelines.","Wood, E.; Bhalloo, I.; McCaig, B.; Feraru, C.; Molnar, M.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.07.21258378v1?rss=1,210

The prospects of using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) for smart farming are immense. However, the cost and the ease in controlling UAVs for smart farming might play an important role for motivating farmers to use UAVs in farming. Mostly, UAVs are controlled by remote controllers using radio waves. There are several technologies such as Wi-Fi or ZigBee that are also used for controlling UAVs. However, Smart Bluetooth (also referred to as Bluetooth Low Energy) is a wireless technology used to transfer data over short distances. Smart Bluetooth is cheaper than other technologies and has the advantage of being available on every smart phone. Farmers can use any smart phone to operate their respective UAVs along with Bluetooth Smart enabled agricultural sensors in the future. However, certain requirements and challenges need to be addressed before UAVs can be operated for smart agriculture-related applications. Hence, in this article, an attempt has been made to explore the types of sensors suitable for smart farming, potential requirements and challenges for operating UAVs in smart agriculture.

The evidence of how this infection impact patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases treated with disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs is still an unmet need. Objectives: The main focus of this study is to evaluate the influence of DMARDs therapy on the evolution of COVID-19 disease in patients with RMDs. The second objective is to study and find correlations between the severity of infection in patients with rheumatic diseases. Methods: A retrospective observational study was conducted between June 2020 and January 2021, enrolling 81 patients with rheumatic diseases that went through SARS-CoV2 infection. The data was collected using patients' clinical documents and through telemedicine, in accordance with EULAR COVID-19 Rheumatological Database. Results: Among the 81 patients, 53 (65,43%) were females and 28 (34,56%) were males. The mean age was 47,9 years old (49,49 years old for females and 45,25 years old for males). The majority lives in urban areas -62 patients (76,54%). The temporal trends of COVID-19 observed in this cohort was in consonance with the evolution of the pandemic in Romania: one third of cases were recorded between June and October 2020 and two-thirds between November 2020 and January 2021, when the number of COVID-19 cases tripled in the general population. Surprisingly, more than 27% of patients in this study were asymptomatic at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis. They were tested according to the protocol before admission to the hospital. 9,8% of patients also asymptomatic, were tested positive as a screening before leaving the country. The majority (45,6%) were symptomatic or contact with someone infected with SARS-CoV2-and tested positive with RT-PCR. We divided the cohort in 3 groups: patients with mild infection that required no hospitalization (22 patients counting for 27,16%), moderate infection -hospitalization but not in the Intensive Care Unit (52 patients -64,19%) and severe infection -admission to the ICU/deaths (7 patients in the ICU, 4 deaths -4,9%). Mild and moderate COVID 19 disease was identified in patients with axial spondyloarthtis (56,7%), with remission or with low disease activity, with a few or no comorbidities, with a mean age of 47,56 years old and also in patients in treatment with MTX (14,86%) or TNF alfa inhibitors (35,13%). 51% of patients stopped the therapy during COVID19 diseases. Factors correlated with severe infection and death were age (the mean age was 62,14), high and moderate disease activity RA, overlap syndromes (RA with SLE or Sjogren Syndrome) and important cardiovascular comorbidities. Two of the deceased patients were in treatment with MTX and RTX (the last infusion was more than 6 months). Conclusion: The data in our study suggests that the use of cs DMARDs (MTX) and TNF alfa inhibitors is associated with better outcomes for patients with RMDs and COVID-19. These results are in accordance with the data found in literature [1,2,3]. The limitation of this study is the little number of patients and the fact that the real number of COVID-19 cases might be higher in reality due to asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic patients.","Trandafir, A.; Saulescu, I.; Balanescu, A.; Opris-Belinski, D.; Bojinca, V.; Berghea, F.; Mazilu, D.; Daia-Iliescu, S.; Predeteanu, D.; Borangiu, A.; Groseanu, L.; Negru, M.

Therefore, the objective of this study is to help end users (clinicians, healthcare providers and organisations) to understand the real-life performance of point-of-care assays, aiding in their implementation in decentralised, true point-of-care facilities, or inside hospitals. 871 studies were screened in 3 major databases and 51 studies were included, evaluating 20 antigen tests and 10 nucleic-acid amplification platforms. We excluded studies that used processed samples, pre-selected populations, archived samples and laboratory-only evaluations and strongly favored prospective trial designs in our inclusion criteria. We also investigated package inserts, instructions for use, comments on published studies and manufacturers websites in order to assess feasibility of POC placement and additional information of relevance to the end user. Apart from sensitivity and specificity, we present information on time to results, hands-on time, kit storage, machine operating conditions and regulatory status. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review to systematically evaluate POC test performance in real-life clinical practice.

Coagulopathy in patients with new coronavirus infection COVID-19 is important for the course and prognosis of the disease. Hypercoagulation, hyperfibrinogenemia and thrombosis are typical manifestations of coagulopathy in the acute phase of the disease. Hypofibrinogenemia in COVID-19 is not widely reported in the literature, and the frequency and reasons of its development are unknown. The use of genetically engineered biological drugs (GEBD) may be one of the possible causes of hypofibrinogenemia but the mechanisms of its development are not clear. Objectives: To determine the role of therapy with interleukin-6 receptor antagonists in the development of hypofibrinogenemia in patients with COVID-19-pneumonia, the clinical significance of hypofibrinogenemia and the mechanism of its occurrence. Patients/Methods. A randomized retrospective study included 239 patients aged 18 to 96 years with confirmed by polymerase chain reaction SARS-CoV-2 infection, computed tomography signs (upon admission to the hospital) of viral pneumonia (grade 2–4) and a duration of hospitalization of more than 2 days. All patients underwent laboratory monitoring, including the determination of hemoglobin, platelets, C-reactive protein (CRP), liver enzymes and fibrinogen according to Claus. All patients received initial therapy with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. At the time of the study, tocilizumab was the only GEBD drug used in the hospital. Therapy with tocilizumab was performed in 164 (68.6%) patients. The study took into account the maximum and minimum values of hemoglobin, platelet, fibrinogen and CRP levels during the hospitalization. Results. Hypofibrinogenemia of varying severity was observed in 39 patients treated with tocilizumab, that was significantly higher than hypofibrinogenemia frequency in 2 patients who did not receive tocilizumab (RR = 8.9;95% CI = 2.2–25.9).

Mainly due to the need for large datasets, these applications have focused on common medical conditions, where much more data is typically available. Leveraging publicly available data, we trained a neural network classifier on images of rare genetic conditions with skin findings. We used approximately 100 images per condition to classify 6 different genetic conditions. Unlike other work related to these types of images, we analyzed both preprocessed images that were cropped to show only the skin lesions, as well as more complex images showing features such as the entire body segment, patient, and/or the background. The classifier construction process included attribution methods to visualize which pixels were most important for computer-based classification. Our classifier was significantly more accurate than pediatricians or medical geneticists for both types of images. Next, we trained two generative adversarial networks to generate new images. The first involved all of the genetic conditions and was used for style-mixing to demonstrate how the diversity of small datasets can be increased. The second focused on different disease stages for one condition and depicted how morphing can illustrate the disease progression of this condition.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Training courses on digital health consultation would be given to participating healthcare workers. The trainees would be trained on all aspects of dental hygiene including precautions, tooth brushing techniques, and oral care. During the 2-day-long course, lady health workers will be taught various tooth brushing techniques, as well as basic instructions about oral hygiene and how to address queries of people regarding oral health. They will also get guidance about the various multimedia softwares in the phone and how to use them. The study would also include teledentistry consultation as a real-time patient learning tool for patients, healthcare workers, and trainees. RESULTS Results will be made available when the trial has been completed in 2021. The program will be evaluated by assessing its usability, acceptability, knowledge, and satisfaction of users. CONCLUSION The protocol is designed to illustrate the underlying concept that a more reliable and robust model can be built through creating interactive communities of practice for consumers of telehealth in dental education. The Telehealth Skills Coaching and Delivery Initiative would incorporate and test a technically oriented paradigm of Internet-based medical education for vertically incorporated, community-based learning environments.

In view of the immense advances made in this field, teledentistry can continue to promote specialized health care in the remotest corners of the world. Many countries have already embraced virtual health care (telemedicine) in the face of an increase in cases of COVID-19; however, teledentistry has yet to play its role in this pandemic by enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of dental treatment. In the case of LMICs such as Pakistan, which lack advanced technologies such as teledentistry within their national healthcare network, the COVID-19 pandemic is a challenge to introduce the requisite legislative changes to promote the widespread use of teledentistry.","Mahdi, Syed Sarosh; Allana, Raheel; Amenta, Francesco",The journal of contemporary dental practice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34267011/,210

Most acute illness, accident-related and long-term condition-related contacts were able to be provided through virtual means, but most prevention-related contacts were face-to-face. CONCLUSIONS This single practice study showed total patient contact was similar over both sample periods, but most contact in 2020 was virtual. Further longitudinal multi-practice studies to confirm these findings and describe future consultation patterns are needed to inform general practice service delivery post-COVID-19.","Atmore, Carol; Stokes, Tim",The New Zealand medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33032304/,210

Nevertheless, discovery of three new human coronaviruses does not necessary represent a sudden increase in emerging infections by new coronaviruses. Only SARS-CoV has recently been introduced to the human population; the other two have been circulating in humans for a long time. HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 are respiratory coronaviruses, are frequently found during lower and upper respiratory tract infections, have spread worldwide, and prefer the winter season. These characteristics do not differ greatly from the symptoms described for the 'old' viruses HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43.

OBJECTIVE To determine and evaluate the trajectory of surgical wound pain from day 1 to day 14 after PSF surgery in AIS patients. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA Information regarding how the post-operative pain improves with time offers invaluable information not only to the patients and parents but also to assist the clinician in managing post-operative pain. METHODS AIS patients who were planned for elective PSF surgery from September 2015 to December 2015 were prospectively recruited into this study. All patients underwent a similar pain management regime with patient controlled anesthesia (PCA) morphine, acetaminophen, celecoxib, oxycodone hydrochloride. RESULTS A total of 40 patients (36F:4 M) were recruited. The visual analogue score (VAS) pain score was highest at 12 hours post-operation (6.0 ± 2.3). It reduced to 3.9 ± 2.2 (day 4), 1.9 ± 1.6 (day 7) and 0.7 ± 1.1 (day 14). The total PCA usage in all patients was 12.4 ± 9.9 mg (1 12 hours), 7.1 ± 8.0 mg (12 to 24 hours), 5.6 ± 6.9 (24 to 36 hours) and 2.1 ± 6.1 mg (36 to 48 hours). The celecoxib capsules usage was reducing from 215.0 ± 152.8 mg at 24 hours to 55.0 ± 90.4 mg on day 14. The acetaminophen usage was reducing from 2275 ± 1198 mg at 24 hours to 150 ± 483 mg at day 14. Oxycodone hydrochloride capsules consumption rose to the peak of 1.4 ± 2.8 mg on day 4 before gradually reducing to none by day 13. CONCLUSIONS With an adequate post-operation pain regime, significant pain should subside to a tolerable level by post-operative day 4 and negligible by post-operative day 7. Patient usually can be discharged on post-operative day 4 when the usage of PCA morphine was not required.","Kwan, Mun Keong; Chiu, Chee Kidd; Chan, Teik Seng; Chong, Kok Ian; Mohamad, Siti Mariam; Hasan, Mohd Shahnaz; Chan, Chris Yin Wei",Spine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27669044/,210

According to many researchers, LBD represents a distinct dementing illness with specific clinical features. The neuropathological hallmark for this disorder is the Lewy body, a spherical intraneuronal cytoplasmic inclusion originally described in brainstem nuclei in Parkinson's disease. In LBD, Lewy bodies are found in subcortical nuclei, such as the substantia nigra, as well as diffusely in the neocortex. Recently, a consortium on dementia with Lewy bodies was held that established consensus guidelines for the clinical and pathological diagnosis of LBD. This review will focus on the newest developments in LBD, addressing specifically clinical and neuropathological features, diagnostic classification, genetics and potential pharmacotherapy.","Brown, D F",Annals of medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10442673/,210

NTM treatment is complex and requires combinations of several drugs for lengthy periods. In spite of this, NTM disease is often associated with poor treatment outcomes. The anti-parasitic family of macrocyclic lactones (ML) (divided in two subfamilies: avermectins and milbemycins) was previously described as having activity against mycobacteria, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium ulcerans, and Mycobacterium marinum, among others. Here, we aimed to characterize the in vitro anti-mycobacterial activity of ML against a wide range of NTM species, including Mycobacteroides abscessus. For this, Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) values of eight ML were determined against 80 strains belonging to nine different NTM species. Macrocyclic lactones showed variable ranges of anti-mycobacterial activity that were compound and species-dependent. Milbemycin oxime was the most active compound, displaying broad-spectrum activity with MIC lower than 8 mg/L. Time kill assays confirmed MIC data and showed bactericidal and sterilizing activity of some compounds. Macrocyclic lactones are available in many formulations and have been extensively used in veterinary and human medicine with suitable pharmacokinetics and safety properties. This information could be exploited to explore repurposing of anti-helminthics for NTM therapy.","Muñoz-Muñoz, Lara Shoen Carolyn Sweet Gaye Vitoria Asunción Bull Tim J.; Cynamon, Michael Thompson Charles J.; Ramón-García, Santiago",Antibiotics,,210

204432,Strategies for the prevention and management of coronavirus disease 2019,2020,"BACKGROUND: Since 2016 Venezuela has seen a collapse in its economy and public health infrastructure resulting in a humanitarian crisis and massive outward migration. With the emergence of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 at the end of 2019, the public health emergency within its borders and in neighboring countries has become more severe and as increasing numbers of Venezuelans migrants return home or get stuck along migratory routes, new risks are emerging in the region. RESULTS: Despite clear state obligations to respect, protect and fulfil the rights to health and related economic, social, civil and political rights of its population, in Venezuela, co-occurring malaria and COVID-19 epidemics are propelled by a lack of public investment in health, weak governance, and violations of human rights, especially for certain underserved populations like indigenous groups. COVID-19 has put increased pressure on Venezuelan and regional actors and healthcare systems, as well as international public health agencies, to deal with a domestic and regional public health emergency. CONCLUSIONS: International aid and cooperation for Venezuela to deal with the re-emergence of malaria and the COVID-19 spread, including lifting US-enforced economic sanctions that limit Venezuela's capacity to deal with this crisis, is critical to protecting rights and health in the country and region.","Correa-Salazar, Catalina; Amon, Joseph J",Global Health,,210

Here we examine the impact of regional lockdown strategies on Covid-19 outcomes. After conducting econometric analyses (Regression Discontinuity and Negative Binomial Regressions) on official data from the National Institute of Health (NIH) Pakistan, we find that the strategies did not lead to a similar level of Covid-19 caseload (positive cases and deaths) in all regions. In terms of reduction in the overall caseload (positive cases and deaths), compared to no lockdown, complete and partial lockdown appeared to be effective in four regions: Balochistan, Gilgit Baltistan (GT), Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT), and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). Contrarily, complete and partial lockdowns did not appear to be effective in containing the virus in the three largest provinces of Punjab, Sindh, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK). The observed regional heterogeneity in the effectiveness of lockdowns advocates for a careful use of lockdown strategies based on the demographic, social, and economic factors.","Umer, Hamza; Khan, Muhammad Salar",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.02987v1.pdf,210

However, most of the clinical studies have been focused on Wuhan, and little is known about the disease outside of Wuhan in China. In this retrospective cohort study, we report the early clinical features of 80 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the hospital in Beijing. The results show that 27 (33.8%) patients had severe illness. Six (7.5%) patients were admitted to the ICU, and 3 (3.8%) patients died. Forty-eight percent (39/80) of the patients had a history of living/traveling in Wuhan. Patients with severe- illness were significantly older (average age, 71 years old vs 44 years old) and had a high incidence of expectoration (59.3% vs 34.0%), shortness of breath (92.6% vs 9.4%), anorexia (51.9% vs 18.9%) and confusion(18.5% vs 0%) compared with nonsevere patients. The systolic blood pressure (median, 130 mmHg vs 120 mmHg) was higher and the oxygen saturation (median, 98.3% vs 92.0%) was significantly lower in severe patients than nonsevere patients. In addition, myoglobin (median, 56.0 ng/mL vs 35.0 ng/mL), troponin I (median, 0.02 pg/mL vs 0.01 pg/mL), C-reactive protein (median, 69.7 mg/L vs 12.9 mg/L) and neutrophils (median, 3.3×109/L vs 2.2×109/L) were significantly increased, while lymphocytes (median, 0.8×109/L vs 1.2×109/L), albumin (mean, 32.8 g/L vs 36.8 g/L) and the creatinine clearance rate (median, 91.2 vs 108.2 ml/min/1.73m2) were significantly decreased among severe patients. Our study revealed that older patients with high levels of C-reactive protein, myoglobin, troponin I, and neutrophil and high systolic blood pressure as well as low levels of lymphocytes, and albumin and a low creatinine clearance rate and oxygen saturation were more likely to have severe disease.","Cao, Zhenhuan; Li, Tongzeng; Liang, Lianchun; Wang, Haibo; Wei, Feili; Meng, Sha; Cai, Miaotian; Zhang, Yulong; Xu, Hui; Zhang, Jiaying; Jin, Ronghua",PLoS One,,210

We analyse DBS collected during spring of 2020 from 878 random and undiagnosed individuals from the population in Stockholm, Sweden, and use classification approaches to estimate an accumulated seroprevalence of 12.5% (95% CI: 10.3%-14.7%). This includes 5.4% of the samples being IgG+IgM+ against several SARS-CoV-2 proteins, as well as 2.1% being IgG-IgM+ and 5.0% being IgG+IgM- for the virus' S protein. Subjects classified as IgG+ for several SARS-CoV-2 proteins report influenza-like symptoms more frequently than those being IgG+ for only the S protein (OR = 6.1; p < 0.001). Among all seropositive cases, 30% are asymptomatic.

The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 was named COVID-19 and was soon declared as pandemic because of the millions of infections and thousands of deaths worldwide. Children infected with SARS-CoV-2 usually develop asymptomatic or mild disease compared to adults. They are also more likely to have atypical and non-specific clinical manifestations than adults. METHODS: A literature search was performed in PubMed and Scopus to summarize the extrapulmonary manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children since the beginning of the pandemic. Peer-reviewed papers in English were retrieved using the following keywords and combinations: 'pediatric', 'child', 'infant', 'neonate', 'novel coronavirus', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'COVID 19' and 'gastrointestinal', 'renal', 'cardiac', 'dermatologic' or 'ophthalmologic'. We included published case series and case reports providing clinical symptoms and signs in SARS-CoV2 pediatric patients. RESULTS: Although fever and symptoms of upper respiratory infection are the most frequently presented, a variety of other atypical presentations has also been reported. The clinical spectrum includes dermatological, ophthalmological, neurological, cardiovascular, renal, reproductive, and gastrointestinal presentations. In addition, a rare multi-inflammatory syndrome associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection has been reported in children, often leading to shock requiring inotropic support and mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians need to be aware of the wider range of extrapulmonary atypical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children, so that appropriate testing, treatment, and public health measures can be implemented rapidly.","Benou, Sofia; Ladhani, Shamez; Dimitriou, Gabriel; Gkentzi, Despoina",Current pediatric reviews (Online),,210

Most dentists had a degree of MDS (Master of Dental Science) (301; 35.0%), followed by BDS (Bachelor of Dental Surgery) (282; 32.8%) and DDS (Doctor of Dental Surgery) (226; 26.3%). High/Good knowledge and practice scores were observed among 92.7% and 79.5 % of the dentists, respectively. Good knowledge scores were significantly associated with qualifications (p = 0.04) and years of practice (p = 0.02); good practice scores were associated with qualifications only (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: The dentists were found to have good knowledge and practice scores, which is important to combat COVID-19. They are advised to follow the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines in their clinics, and sensitize their staff so that no stone is left unturned in defeating this pandemic.","Kamate, Shivalingesh Krishnappa; Sharma, Swati; Thakar, Sahil; Srivastava, Divya; Sengupta, Kaushikee; Hadi, Ahmed Jhurry; Chaudhary, Alankrita; Joshi, Ruby; Dhanker, Kuldeep",Dent Med Probl,,210
212527,"Tracheostomy in coronavirus disease 2019: timing, outcomes, prognosis and technique",2020,"BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a kind of chronic lung disease that mainly induced by smoking-caused inflammation. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to play a part in the course of pulmonary diseases. Here, we studied the role of lncRNA NNT-AS1 in the development of COPD. MATERIALS: qRT-PCR analysis and ELISA assay were applied to evaluate the expression of genes and inflammatory cytokines, respectively. CCK8 and EdU assays were utilized to assess proliferation, while flow cytometry assay was conducted to evaluate apoptosis. Luciferase reporter, RNA pull down and RIP assays were combined to explore relationships between genes. RESULTS: NNT-AS1 was observed to be up-regulated in cigarette smoke extract (CSE)-treated 16HBE cells. Knockdown of NNT-AS1 abolished CSE-caused suppressive effects on cell proliferation, apoptosis, inflammation and airway remodeling. Mechanistically, NNT-AS1 up-regulated FBXO11 expression via sponging miR-582-5p. Moreover, miR-582-5p inhibitor or FBXO11 overexpression counteracted NNT-AS1 silence-elicited effects on proliferation, apoptosis, inflammation and airway remodeling. CONCLUSION: Our data revealed that NNT-AS1 played a promoting role in smoking-induced COPD via modulating miR-582-5p/FBXO11 signaling, suggesting a novel potential target for COPD treatment.","Mei, Jingjing; Zhang, Yuan; Lu, Shuangshuang; Wang, Jing",Biomed Pharmacother,,210

Initially, SARS-CoV-2 infects cells in the respiratory system and causes inflammation and cell death. Subsequently, the virus spreads out and damages other vital organs and tissues, triggering a complicated spectrum of pathophysiological changes and symptoms, including cardiovascular complications. Acting as the receptor for SARS-CoV entering mammalian cells, angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) plays a pivotal role in the regulation of cardiovascular cell function. Diverse clinical manifestations and laboratory abnormalities occur in patients with cardiovascular injury in COVID-19, characterizing the development of this complication, as well as providing clues to diagnosis and treatment. This review provides a summary of the rapidly appearing laboratory and clinical evidence for the pathophysiology and therapeutic approaches to COVID-19 pulmonary and cardiovascular complications.","Geng, Yong-Jian; Wei, Zhi-Yao; Qian, Hai-Yan; Huang, Ji; Lodato, Robert; Castriotta, Richard J",Cardiovasc Pathol,,210
216756,"Clinical Characteristics and Risk Factors for Disease Severity and Death in Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Wuhan, China",2020,"Purpose: Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) was firstly reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, China and soon after, the number of cases increased rapidly worldwide. As of May 2, 2020, more than 3,000,000 confirmed cases have been reported world. In Macao, there were 45 confirmed COVID-19 cases until May 2, 2020. Material and Methods: In this study, we summarized the radiological features of these cases and analyzed relationship between the clinical characteristics and radiological findings. We retrospectively analyzed the imaging manifestations of the 45 cases with COVID-19 in Macao, focusing on identifying and characterizing the most common radiological findings of COVID-19. We retrospectively analyze the relationship between the clinical features and radiological finding of COVID-19 pneumonia. Results: This study showed that chest CT manifestations of COVID-19 were multiple ground-glass densities in both lungs. It is dominated by bilateral peripheral subpleural distribution, which may be accompanied by consolidation, interlobular septa thickening, and adjacent pleura thickening. As the disease progresses, it can manifest as consolidation of the lungs in CT scan. We also found the age, smoking and hypertension may be risk factor for predicting the severity of COVID-19 in radiology. Conclusion: COVID-19 should be diagnosed based on the clinical feature, nCoV PCR test and radiological manifestation. The main manifestation of COVID-19 is peripheral ground glass opacity. Age, smoking and hypertension may be used to predict the severity of COVID-19. Chest CT is the important radiological method for screening and detecting COVID-19 patients.","Ieong, Chon Man; Xu, Xi; Kong, Soi Chau; Luo, Liangping",Eur J Radiol Open,,210
217240,"Focus on kidney disease among the coronavirus disease 2019 patients: A comparative perspective between China, Italy and the United States",2020,"BackgroundThe newly described SARS-CoV-2 lineage C.37 was recently classified as a variant of interest by the WHO (Lambda variant) based on its high circulation rates in South American countries and the presence of critical mutations in the spike protein. The impact of such mutations in infectivity and immune escape from neutralizing antibodies are entirely unknown. MethodsWe performed a pseudotyped virus neutralization assay and determined the impact of the Lambda variant on infectivity and immune escape using plasma samples from healthcare workers (HCW) from two centers in Santiago, Chile who received the two-doses scheme of the inactivated virus vaccine CoronaVac. ResultsWe observed an increased infectivity mediated by the Lambda spike protein that was even higher than that of the D614G (lineage B) or the Alpha and Gamma variants. Compared to the Wild type (lineage A), neutralization was decreased by 3.05-fold for the Lambda variant while it was 2.33-fold for the Gamma variant and 2.03-fold for the Alpha variant. ConclusionsOur results indicate that mutations present in the spike protein of the Lambda variant of interest confer increased infectivity and immune escape from neutralizing antibodies elicited by CoronaVac. These data reinforce the idea that massive vaccination campaigns in countries with high SARS-CoV-2 circulation must be accompanied by strict genomic surveillance allowing the identification of new isolates carrying spike mutations and immunology studies aimed to determine the impact of these mutations in immune escape and vaccines breakthrough.","Mamp,; Acevedo, oacutenica L.; Alonso-Palomares, Luis; Andramp,; Bustamante, eacutes; Gaggero, Aldo; Paredes, Fabio; Cortamp, Claudia; eacutes,; Valiente-Echeverramp, Fernando; iacutea,; Soto-Rifo, Ricardo",,,210
217700,Should interferons take front stage as an essential MS disease-modifying therapy in the era of coronavirus disease 2019?,2020,"The outbreak of COVID-19 constitutes an unprecedented disruption globally, in which risk management framework is on top priority in many countries. Travel restriction and home/office quarantine are some frequently utilized non-pharmaceutical interventions, which bring the worst crisis of airline industry compared with other transport modes. Therefore, the post-recovery of global air transport is extremely important, which is full of uncertainty but rare to be studied. The explicit/implicit interacted factors generate difficulties in drawing insights into the complicated relationship and policy intervention assessment. In this paper, a Causal Bayesian Network (CBN) is utilized for the modelling of the post-recovery behaviour, in which parameters are synthesized from expert knowledge, open-source information and interviews from travellers. The tendency of public policy in reaction to COVID-19 is analyzed, whilst sensitivity analysis and forward/backward belief propagation analysis are conducted. Results show the feasibility and scalability of this model. On condition that no effective health intervention method (vaccine, medicine) will be available soon, it is predicted that nearly 120 days from May 22, 2020, would be spent for the number of commercial flights to recover back to 58.52%-60.39% on different interventions. This intervention analysis framework is of high potential in the decision making of recovery preparedness and risk management for building the new normal of global air transport.","Zhu, Chunli; Liu, Mingyu; Li, Duowei; Kouvelas, Anastasios",,,210

The present study was conducted with an aim to assess the acute postoperative pain experiences, its interference with ADLs, emotions, sleep, IPR and satisfaction with pain management among patients who had undergone elective surgeries. Methods: In this observational study, 200 postoperative adult patients; who had undergone elective surgery were interviewed using American Pain Society's Patient Outcome and Satisfaction Survey Questionnaire. Pain perception and interference of pain with ADLs, emotions, sleep, and IPR was measured on 0-10 numerical scale and satisfaction on 6 point Likert scale, i.e., very satisfied to very dissatisfied. Results: There was high incidence (82.5%) of acute postoperative pain experience and mean score for worst episodes of pain was significantly high, i.e., 7.6 ± 1.5, which had significant interference with ADLs (5.6 ± 2.1), sleep (3.6 ± 1.7), and emotions (3.6 ± 1.6). Majority of patients reported that pain was assessed only once (17%) or twice (48.5%) in each shift. Despite of poor pain control, a large number of patients were satisfied with overall pain treatment (69%), and response of physicians (81%) and nurses (62%) for their pain complaints. Acute pain score was directly associated with the duration of postoperative hospital stay (P = 0.001). Conclusion: Acute postoperative pain was inadequately assessed and undertreated but still a large number of participants were satisfied with acute postoperative pain management probably because patients expects that pain is inevitable after surgery. Postoperative pain had significant interference with ADLs, emotions and sleep of patients, which may affect postoperative comfort and recovery.","Sharma, Suresh K; Thakur, Kalpana; Mudgal, Shiv K; Payal, Yashwant S",Indian J Anaesth,,210

220150,Hydroxychloroquine: A comprehensive review and its controversial role in coronavirus disease 2019,2020,"OBJECTIVES: The recent COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted mental healthcare delivery, with many services shifting from in-person to remote patient contact. We investigated the impact of the pandemic on the use of remote consultation and on the prescribing of psychiatric medications. DESIGN AND SETTING: The Clinical Record Interactive Search tool was used to examine deidentified electronic health records of people receiving mental healthcare from the South London and Maudsley (SLaM) NHS Foundation Trust. Data from the period before and after the onset of the pandemic were analysed using linear regression, and visualised using locally estimated scatterplot smoothing. PARTICIPANTS: All patients receiving care from SLaM between 7 January 2019 and 20 September 2020 (around 37 500 patients per week). OUTCOME MEASURES: (i) The number of clinical contacts (in-person, remote or non-attended) with mental healthcare professionals per week.(ii) Prescribing of antipsychotic and mood stabiliser medications per week. RESULTS: Following the onset of the pandemic, the frequency of in-person contacts was significantly reduced compared with that in the previous year (ß coefficient: -5829.6 contacts, 95% CI -6919.5 to -4739.6, p<0.001), while the frequency of remote contacts significantly increased (ß coefficient: 3338.5 contacts, 95% CI 3074.4 to 3602.7, p<0.001). Rates of remote consultation were lower in older adults than in working age adults, children and adolescents. Despite this change in the type of patient contact, antipsychotic and mood stabiliser prescribing remained at similar levels. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with a marked increase in remote consultation, particularly among younger patients. However, there was no evidence that this has led to changes in psychiatric prescribing. Nevertheless, further work is needed to ensure that older patients are able to access mental healthcare remotely.","Patel, Rashmi; Irving, Jessica; Brinn, Aimee; Broadbent, Matthew; Shetty, Hitesh; Pritchard, Megan; Downs, Johnny; Stewart, Robert; Harland, Robert; McGuire, Philip",BMJ Open,,210

221743,Hospital visiting policies in the time of coronavirus disease 2019: A nationwide website survey in Taiwan,2020,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may contribute to delayed presentations of acute myocardial infarction. Delayed presentation with late reperfusion is often associated with an increased risk of mechanical complications and adverse outcomes. Inherent delays are possible as every patient who is acutely sick is being considered a potential case or a career of COVID-19. Also, standardized personal protective equipment precautions are established for all members of the team, regardless of pending COVID-19 testing which might further add to delays. AIM: To compare performance measures and clinical outcomes of all patients who presented to our facility with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) during the COVID-19 pandemic to same time cohort from 2019. METHODS: All patients who presented to our facility with STEMI during the pandemic were compared to a matched cohort during the same time period in 2019. STEMI with unknown time of symptom onset and inpatient STEMI patients were excluded. Primary outcome was major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in-hospital and up to 14 d after STEMI, including death, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, or stroke. Significant differences among groups for continuous variables were tested through ANOVA, using SYSTAT, version 13. Chi-square tests of association were used to compare patient characteristics among groups using SYSTAT. Relative risk scores and associated tests for significance were calculated for discrete variables using MedCalc (MedCalc Software, Ostend, Belgium). RESULTS: There was a significantly longer time interval from symptom onset to first medical contact (FMC) in the COVID-19 group (P &lt; 0.02). Time to first electrocardiogram, door-to-balloon time, and FMC to balloon time were not significantly affected. The right coronary artery was the most common culprit for STEMI in both the cohorts. Over 60% of patients had one or more obstructive (&gt; 50%) lesion(s) remote from the culprit site. In-hospital and 14 d MACE were more prevalent in the COVID-19 group (P &lt; 0.01 and P &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSION: This single academic center study in the United States suggests that there is a delay in patients with STEMI seeking medical attention during the COVID-19 pandemic which could be translating into worse clinical outcomes.","Smith, M.; Singh, A.; McElroy, D.; Mittal, S.; Pham, R.",World Journal of Cardiology,,210

The sequences are represented by sets of ""material points"" in a 4D space - 4D-dynamic graphs. The graphs representing the sequences are treated as ""rigid bodies"" and characterized by values analogous to the ones used in the classical dynamics. As the graphical representations of the sequences, the projections of the graphs into 2D and 3D spaces are used. The method has been applied to an analysis of the complete genome sequences of the 2019 novel coronavirus. As a result, 2D and 3D classification maps are obtained. The coordinate axes in the maps correspond to the values derived from the exact formulas characterizing the graphs: the coordinates of the centers of mass and the 4D moments of inertia. The points in the maps represent sequences and their coordinates are used as the classifiers. The main result of this work has been derived from the 3D classification maps. The distribution of clusters of points which emerged in these maps, supports the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 may have originated in bat and in pangolin.

Health literacy (HL), eHealth literacy (eHEAL), and digital healthy diet literacy (DDL) may have potential impacts on containing the pandemic and its consequences. This study aimed to examine the association between the fear of COVID-19 scale (FCoV-19S) and the health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and to examine the effect modification by HL, eHEAL, and DDL on this association. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 11 hospitals across Vietnam from 7 April to 31 May 2020. Data were collected on 4348 outpatients, including demographic characteristics, HL, eHEAL, DDL, FCoV-19S, and HRQoL. Multiple linear regression and interaction models were used to explore associations. RESULTS: Patients with higher FCoV-19S scores had lower HRQoL scores (unstandardized coefficient, B = -0.78, p < 0.001). HL (B = 0.20, p < 0.001), eHEAL (B = 0.24, p < 0.001), and DDL (B = 0.20, p < 0.001) were positively associated with higher HRQoL scores. The negative impact of FCoV-19S on HRQoL was significantly attenuated by higher eHEAL score groups (from one standard deviation (SD) below the mean, B = -0.93, p < 0.001; to the mean, B = -0.85, p < 0.001; and one SD above the mean, B = -0.77, p < 0.001); and by higher DDL score groups (from one SD below the mean, B = -0.92, p < 0.001; to the mean, B = -0.82, p < 0.001; and one SD above the mean, B = -0.72, p < 0.001).

To address this pandemic broad testing with an easy, comfortable and reliable testing method is of utmost concern. Nasopharyngeal (NP) swab sampling is the reference method though hampered by international supply shortages. A new oropharyngeal/nasal (OP/N) sampling method was investigated using the more readily available throat swab. RESULTS: 35 patients were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 by means of either NP or OP/N sampling. The paired swabs were both positive in 31 patients. The one patient who tested negative on both NP and OP/N swab on admission, was ultimately diagnosed on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. A strong correlation was found between the viral RNA loads of the paired swabs (r = 0.76; P < 0.05). The sensitivity of NP and OP/N analysis in hospitalized patients (n = 28) was 89.3% and 92.7% respectively.

In SARS coronaviruses, the non-structural protein 16 (nsp16), in conjunction with nsp10, methylates the 5'-end of virally encoded mRNAs to mimic cellular mRNAs, thus protecting the virus from host innate immune restriction. We report here the high-resolution structure of a ternary complex of SARS-CoV-2 nsp16 and nsp10 in the presence of cognate RNA substrate analogue and methyl donor, S-adenosyl methionine (SAM). The nsp16/nsp10 heterodimer is captured in the act of 2'-O methylation of the ribose sugar of the first nucleotide of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA. We observe large conformational changes associated with substrate binding as the enzyme transitions from a binary to a ternary state. This induced fit model provides mechanistic insights into the 2'-O methylation of the viral mRNA cap. We also discover a distant (25 Å) ligand-binding site unique to SARS-CoV-2, which can alternatively be targeted, in addition to RNA cap and SAM pockets, for antiviral development.","Viswanathan, Thiruselvam; Arya, Shailee; Chan, Siu-Hong; Qi, Shan; Dai, Nan; Misra, Anurag; Park, Jun-Gyu; Oladunni, Fatai; Kovalskyy, Dmytro; Hromas, Robert A; Martinez-Sobrido, Luis; Gupta, Yogesh K",Nat Commun,,210

Different analyses propose models to predict the evolution of this epidemic. These analyses propose models for specific geographical areas, specific countries, or create a global model. The models give us the possibility to predict the virus behavior, it could be used to make future response plans. This work presents an analysis of COVID-19 spread that shows a different angle for the whole world, through 6 geographic regions (continents). We propose to create a relationship between the countries, which are in the same geographical area to predict the advance of the virus. The countries in the same geographic region have variables with similar values (quantifiable and non-quantifiable), which affect the spread of the virus. We propose an algorithm to performed and evaluated the ARIMA model for 145 countries, which are distributed into 6 regions. Then, we construct a model for these regions using the ARIMA parameters, the population per 1M people, the number of cases, and polynomial functions. The proposal is able to predict the COVID-19 cases with a RMSE average of 144.81. The main outcome of this paper is showing a relation between COVID-19 behavior and population in a region, these results show us the opportunity to create more models to predict the COVID-19 behavior using variables as humidity, climate, culture, among others.","Hernandez-Matamoros, Andres; Fujita, Hamido; Hayashi, Toshitaka; Perez-Meana, Hector",Appl.

The purpose of this study was to investigate post-traumatic stress and related factors among hospital nurses during the COVID-19 outbreak. The subjects of this study were 300 nurses who worked in three general hospitals that operated National Designated Isolation Unit (NDIU) wards during the COVID-19 outbreak. Self-reporting questionnaires were used to collect data on post-traumatic stress, general characteristics, and work-related information. The average post-traumatic stress score was 20.68 ± 19.5 points and 36.7% of participants were at high risk of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The odds ratio (OR) for PTSD was higher for nurses who worked in the NDIU ward (OR = 16.31, 95% CI = 3.79-70.32), who responded that nurse staffing was poor (OR = 3.03, 95% CI = 1.01-9.10), and who responded that they experienced COVID-19 symptoms (OR = 3.83, 95% CI = 1.89-7.75). Total 36.7% of nurses were at risk of PTSD and the factors related to PTSD were the work department, nurse staffing, and experiencing COVID-19 symptoms. These results could be used to manage PTSD and provide psychological support of nurses during infectious disease epidemics, such as COVID-19.","Moon, Da-Jeong; Han, Mi Ah; Park, Jong; Ryu, So Yeon",Psychiatr. q,,210

In the scarcity of a potential antiviral and protective vaccine, COVID-19 has posed high public health concerns, panic, and challenges to limit the spread of this pandemic virus. Only recently have a few vaccine candidates been developed, and vaccination programs have started in some countries. Multiple clinical presentations of COVID-19, animal spillover, cross-species jumping, zoonotic concerns, and emergence of virus variants have altogether created havoc during this ongoing pandemic. Several bodies of research are continuously working to elucidate the exact molecular mechanisms of the pathogenesis. To develop a prospective antiviral therapy/vaccine for SARSCoV-2, it is quite essential to gain insight into the immunobiology and molecular virology of SARS-CoV-2. A thorough literature search was conducted up to 28th February 2021 in the PubMed and other databases for the articles describing the immunopathology and immune response of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which were critically evaluated and used to compile this article to present an overall update. Some of the information was drawn from studies on previous MERS and SARS viruses. Innate as well as adaptive immunity responses are elicited by exposure to SARS-CoV-2.

Such general population control measures could significantly influence perception, knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) towards COVID-19. Here, we assessed KAP towards COVID-19 immediately after the lock-down measures were implemented and during the rapid rise period of the outbreak. Online-based cross-sectional study conducted from March 29 to April 19, 2020, involving Bangladeshi residents aged 12-64 years, recruited via social media. After consenting, participants completed an online survey assessing socio-demographic variables, perception, and KAP towards COVID-19. Of the 2017 survey participants, 59.8% were male, the majority were students (71.2%), aged 21-30 years (57.9%), having a bachelor's degree (61.0%), having family income >30,000 BDT (50.0%), and living in urban areas (69.8). The survey revealed that 48.3% of participants had more accurate knowledge, 62.3% had more positive attitudes, and 55.1% had more frequent practices regarding COVID-19 prevention. Majority (96.7%) of the participants agreed 'COVID-19 is a dangerous disease', almost all (98.7%) participants wore a face mask in crowded places, 98.8% agreed to report a suspected case to health authorities, and 93.8% implemented washing hands with soap and water. In multiple logistic regression analyses, COVID-19 more accurate knowledge was associated with age and residence. Sociodemographic factors such as being older, higher education, employment, monthly family income >30,000 BDT, and having more frequent prevention practices were the more positive attitude factors. More frequent prevention practice factors were associated with female sex, older age, higher education, family income > 30,000 BDT, urban area residence, and having more positive attitudes. To improve KAP of general populations is crucial during the rapid rise period of a pandemic outbreak such as COVID-19. Therefore, development of effective health education programs that incorporate considerations of KAP-modifying factors is needed.","Ferdous, Most Zannatul; Islam, Md Saiful; Sikder, Md Tajuddin; Mosaddek, Abu Syed Md; Zegarra-Valdivia, J A; Gozal, David",PLoS One,,210

In the present work, from July to December 2020, the number of copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in Marseille's wastewater was correlated with the number of new positive cases diagnosed in our Institute of Infectious Disease, which tested about 20% of the city's population. Number of positive cases and number of copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater were significantly correlated (p = 0.013). During the great epidemic peak, from October to December 2020, the curves of virus in the sewers and the curves of positive diagnoses were perfectly superposed. During the summer period, the superposition of curves was less evident as subject to many confounding factors that were discussed. We also tried to correlate the effect of viral circulation in wastewater with containment measures, probably the most unbiased correlation on their potential inflection effect of epidemic curves. Not only is this correlation not obvious, but it also clearly appears that the drop in cases as well as the drop in the viral load in the sewers occur before the containment measures. In fact, this suggests that there are factors that initiate the end of the epidemic peak independently of the containment measure. These factors will therefore need to be explored more deeply in the future.","Wurtz, N.; Lacoste, A.; Jardot, P.; Delache, A.; Fontaine, X.; Verlande, M.; Annessi, A.; Giraud-Gatineau, A.; Chaudet, H.; Fournier, P.

235708,Two Immunocompromised Patients With Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage as a Complication of Severe Coronavirus Disease 2019,2020,"BACKGROUND: The world is threatened by future pandemics. Vaccines can play a key role in preventing harm, but there will inevitably be shortages because there is no possibility of advance stockpiling. We therefore need some method of prioritising access. MAIN TEXT: This paper reports a critical interpretative review of the published literature that discusses ethical arguments used to justify how we could prioritise vaccine during an influenza pandemic. We found that the focus of the literature was often on proposing different groups as priorities (e.g. those with pre-existing health conditions, the young, the old, health care workers etc.). Different reasons were often suggested as a means of justifying such priority groupings (e.g. appeal to best overall outcomes, fairness, belonging to a vulnerable or 'at risk' group etc.). We suggest that much of the literature, wrongly, assumes that we are able to plan priority groups prior to the time of a particular pandemic and development of a particular vaccine. We also point out the surprising absence of various issues from the literature (e.g. how vaccines fit within overall pandemic planning, a lack of specificity about place, issues of global justice etc.). CONCLUSIONS: The literature proposes a wide range of ways to prioritise vaccines, focusing on different groups and 'principles'. Any plan to use pandemic vaccine must provide justifications for its prioritisation. The focus of this review was influenza pandemic vaccines, but lessons can be learnt for future allocations of coronavirus vaccine, if one becomes available.","Williams, Jane H; Dawson, Angus",BMC Med Ethics,,210

Outpatients who had recently been diagnosed with COVID-19 or were presenting with suspected COVID-19 were asked to have a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab collected and provide at least one self-collected sample type. Participants were also asked about sample acceptability using a five-point Likert scale. For those previously diagnosed with COVID-19, all samples underwent real-time PCR testing using a lab-developed assay, and the majority were also tested using an FDA-authorized assay. For those presenting with suspected COVID-19, only those with a positive nasopharyngeal swab sample went on to have other samples tested. Saline mouth rinse/gargle and saliva samples were tested daily at time zero, day 1, and day 2 to assess nucleic acid stability at room temperature. Fifty participants (aged 4 to 71 years) were included; of these, 40 had at least one positive sample and were included in the primary sample yield analysis. Saline mouth rinse/gargle samples had a sensitivity of 98% (39/40), while saliva samples had a sensitivity of 79% (26/33). Both saline mouth rinse/gargle and saliva samples showed stable viral RNA detection after 2 days of room temperature storage. Mouth rinse/gargle samples had the highest (mean, 4.9) and health care worker (HCW)-collected NP swabs had the lowest acceptability scores (mean, 3.1). In conclusion, saline mouth rinse/gargle samples demonstrated higher combined user acceptability ratings and analytical performance than saliva and HCW-collected NP swabs.

Adult trials were composed of more female participants (75â¯325 [56.0%]), but among those reporting age as a percentage, enrollment of participants who were aged 65 years or older was low (12.1%; 95% CI, 12.0%-12.3%). Black or African American participants (10.1%; 95% CI, 9.7%-10.6%) and Hispanic or Latino participants (22.5%; 95% CI, 21.6%-23.4%) were also underrepresented in pediatric trials. Among trials reporting race/ethnicity, 65 (48.5%) did not include American Indian or Alaska Native participants and 81 (60.4%) did not include Hawaiian or Pacific Islander participants. Conclusions and Relevance: This cross-sectional study found that among US-based vaccine clinical trials, members of racial/ethnic minority groups and older adults were underrepresented, whereas female adults were overrepresented. These findings suggest that diversity enrollment targets should be included for all vaccine trials targeting epidemiologically important infections.","Flores, Laura E; Frontera, Walter R; Andrasik, Michele P; Del Rio, Carlos; Mondríguez-González, Antonio; Price, Stephanie A; Krantz, Elizabeth M; Pergam, Steven A; Silver, Julie K",JAMA Netw Open,,210
237483,Prediction and analysis of Coronavirus Disease 2019,2020-03-11,"BACKGROUND: There is inconclusive and controversial evidence of the association between allergic diseases and the risk of adverse clinical outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the association of allergic disorders with the likelihood of a positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) test result and with clinical outcomes of COVID-19 (admission to intensive care unit, administration of invasive ventilation, and death). METHODS: A propensity-score-matched nationwide cohort study was performed in South Korea. Data obtained from the Health Insurance Review & Assessment Service of Korea from all adult patients (age, >20 years) who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 in South Korea between January 1, 2020, and May 15, 2020, were analyzed. The association of SARS-CoV-2 test positivity and allergic diseases in the entire cohort (n = 219,959) and the difference in clinical outcomes of COVID-19 were evaluated in patients with allergic diseases and SARS-CoV-2 positivity (n = 7,340). RESULTS: In the entire cohort, patients who underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing were evaluated to ascertain whether asthma and allergic rhinitis were associated with an increased likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 test positivity. After propensity score matching, we found that asthma and allergic rhinitis were associated with worse clinical outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with SARS-CoV-2 test positivity. Patients with nonallergic asthma had a greater risk of SARS-CoV-2 test positivity and worse clinical outcomes of COVID-19 than patients with allergic asthma. CONCLUSIONS: In a Korean nationwide cohort, allergic rhinitis and asthma, especially nonallergic asthma, confers a greater risk of susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe clinical outcomes of COVID-19.","Yang, Jee Myung; Koh, Hyun Yong; Moon, Sung Yong; Yoo, In Kyung; Ha, Eun Kyo; You, Seulgi; Kim, So Young; Yon, Dong Keon; Lee, Seung Won",J Allergy Clin Immunol,,210

245682,Egypt's second wave of coronavirus disease of 2019 pandemic and its impact on patients with inflammatory bowel disease,2021,"We propose a robust in-time predictor for in-hospital COVID-19 patient's probability of requiring mechanical ventilation. A challenge in the risk prediction for COVID-19 patients lies in the great variability and irregular sampling of patient's vitals and labs observed in the clinical setting. Existing methods have strong limitations in handling time-dependent features' complex dynamics, either oversimplifying temporal data with summary statistics that lose information or over-engineering features that lead to less robust outcomes. We propose a novel in-time risk trajectory predictive model to handle the irregular sampling rate in the data, which follows the dynamics of risk of performing mechanical ventilation for individual patients. The model incorporates the Multi-task Gaussian Process using observed values to learn the posterior joint multi-variant conditional probability and infer the missing values on a unified time grid. The temporal imputed data is fed into a multi-objective self-attention network for the prediction task. A novel positional encoding layer is proposed and added to the network for producing in-time predictions. The positional layer outputs a risk score at each user-defined time point during the entire hospital stay of an inpatient. We frame the prediction task into a multi-objective learning framework, and the risk scores at all time points are optimized altogether, which adds robustness and consistency to the risk score trajectory prediction. Our experimental evaluation on a large database with nationwide in-hospital patients with COVID-19 also demonstrates that it improved the state-of-the-art performance in terms of AUC (Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve) and AUPRC (Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve) performance metrics, especially at early times after hospital admission.","Zhang, Kai; Karanth, Siddharth; Patel, Bela; Murphy, Robert; Jiang, Xiaoqian",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01147v1.pdf,210

Measures to contain the pandemic are currently taking effect and societies in general and healthcare systems in particular are considering how to return to normalcy. This opens up the discussion when and how clinical trials should be restarted while the COVID-19 pandemic has not yet resolved, and what should happen in case of a resurgence of the virus in the coming months. This article uses the four ethical principles framework as a structured approach to come to a set of practical, ethically grounded guidelines for halting and relaunching clinical trials during the COVID-19 pandemic. The framework applied provides a structured approach for all clinical trials stakeholders and thereby prevents unclear reasoning in a complex situation. While it is essential to prevent the virus from resurging and focus on developing a COVID-19 treatment as soon as possible, it is just as important to our society that we continue developing new drugs for other conditions. In this article we argue that the situation for clinical trials is not essentially different from the pre-COVID-19 era and that an overcautious approach will have negative consequences.","Vissers, Maurits F J M; Cohen, Adam F; Van Gerven, Joop M A; Groeneveld, Geert Jan",,,210

The rotavirus vaccine was included in Poland's national immunization program in 2021. Our study aimed to summarize the epidemiology of AGE in northeastern Poland prior to 2021 and to evaluate the effectiveness of voluntary, out-of-pocket rotavirus childhood vaccination on the incidence of rotavirus AGE. METHODS: A review of patients aged 0-17 years with gastroenteritis hospitalized between 2006 and 2020 in northeastern Poland in the context of rotavirus vaccine coverage in the region. RESULTS: Rotavirus was the most common agent of gastroenteritis in hospitalized patients. The seasonality of rotavirus gastroenteritis peaked between February and May in each year of study, except for 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic skewed any viable comparison of seasonality. Rotavirus vaccine coverage in northeastern Poland did not exceed 25% during the study period and had no impact on hospitalization numbers. CONCLUSIONS: Rotavirus was the primary causative agent of AGE in children hospitalized in northeastern Poland during the study period. Voluntary vaccinations did not affect the number of hospitalizations due to rotavirus AGE. Our data suggest that universal immunization is key to achieving a significant reduction of rotavirus-associated diarrhea.","Toczylowski, Kacper; Jackowska, Katarzyna; Lewandowski, Dawid; Kurylonek, Sandra; Waszkiewicz-Stojda, Marlena; Sulik, Artur",Int J Infect Dis,,210

246873,Videoconferencing for multidisciplinary team meetings in the coronavirus disease era - human factors awareness and recognition,2020,"In spring 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic was declared. The threat the pandemic poses as well as associated lockdown measures created challenging times for many. This study aimed to investigate the individual and social factors associated with low mental health, particularly perceived threat and lockdown measures, and factors associated with psychological well-being, particularly sense of control. An online survey was completed by participants (N = 8,229) recruited from 79 countries. In line with pre-registered hypotheses, participants showed elevated levels of anxiety and depression worldwide. This poor mental health was predicted by perceived threat. The effect of threat on depression was further moderated by social isolation, but there was no effect of sense of control. Sense of control was low overall, and was predicted negatively by maladaptive coping, but positively by adaptive coping and the perception that the government is dealing with the outbreak. Social isolation increased with quarantine duration, but was mitigated by frequent communication with close ones. Engaging in individual actions to avoid contracting the virus was associated with higher anxiety, except when done professionally. We suggest that early lockdown of the pandemic may have had detrimental psychological effects, which may be alleviated by individual actions such as maintaining frequent social contact and adaptive coping, and by governmental actions which demonstrate support in a public health crisis. Citizens and governments can work together to adapt better to restrictive but necessary measures during the current and future pandemics.","van Mulukom, Valerie; Muzzulini, Barbara; Rutjens, Bastiaan T; van Lissa, Caspar J; Farias, Miguel",Transl Behav Med,,210

From 58 PWE who personally responded to the survey, 27 (46.6%) would be willing to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Among the 53 caregivers, 18 (34.0%) would accept the person they care for to be vaccinated. Willingness to be vaccinated was associated with receiving an influenza shot in 2020 (odds ratio (OR) = 9.17, 95% confidence interval (CI = 1.15-73.47), the beliefs that vaccines are generally safe (OR = 7.90, 95% CI = 2.43-25.74) and that they are the only convenient way to gain immunity (OR = 3.91, 95% CI = 1.02-15.05).

On multiple regression analysis, longer distance to hospital, low socioeconomic status, more than one antiglaucoma medication use, lack of awareness of glaucoma, non-complaint before COVID-19 and stress due to the pandemic were found to be significant factors for medication non adherence. Conclusion: COVID-19 pandemic has emphasized the need for reformation in health care system for accessibility of medical care to patients in rural areas. Decentralization of health system to primary care level and utilization of teleophthalmology should be considered by health care planners in future.","Subathra, G N; Rajendrababu, Sharmila R; Senthilkumar, Vijayalakshmi A; Mani, Iswarya; Udayakumar, B",Indian J Ophthalmol,,210

METHODS: In this randomized, open-label, parallel-arm, multicenter, phase 3 trial, adults (18-75 years) with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 and mild-to-moderate symptoms (including asymptomatic) were randomized 1:1 to oral favipiravir (day 1: 1800 mg BID and days 2-14: 800 mg BID) plus standard supportive care versus supportive care alone. The primary endpoint was time to the cessation of viral shedding;time to clinical cure was also measured. RESULTS: From May 14 to July 3, 2020, 150 patients were randomized to favipiravir (n = 75) or control (n = 75). Median time to the cessation of viral shedding was 5 days (95% CI: 4 days, 7 days) versus 7 days (95% CI: 5 days, 8 days), P = 0.129, and median time to clinical cure was 3 days (95% CI: 3 days, 4 days) versus 5 days (95% CI: 4 days, 6 days), P = 0.030, for favipiravir and control, respectively. Adverse events were observed in 36% of favipiravir and 8% of control patients. One control patient died due to worsening disease. CONCLUSION: The lack of statistical significance on the primary endpoint was confounded by limitations of the RT-PCR assay. Significant improvement in time to clinical cure suggests favipiravir may be beneficial in mild-to-moderate COVID-19.","Udwadia, Z.

252824,Should Patients Receiving ACE Inhibitors or Angiotensin Receptor Blockers be Switched to Other Antihypertensive Drugs to Prevent or Improve Prognosis of Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)?,2020,"OBJECTIVES: This study aims to investigate the relationship between daily weather and transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2, and to develop a generalised model for future prediction of the COVID-19 spreading rate for a certain area with meteorological factors. DESIGN: A retrospective, qualitative study. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We collected 382 596 records of weather data with four meteorological factors, namely, average temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and air visibility, and 15 192 records of epidemic data with daily new confirmed case counts (1 587 209 confirmed cases in total) in nearly 500 areas worldwide from 20 January 2020 to 9 April 2020. Epidemic data were modelled against weather data to find a model that could best predict the future outbreak. RESULTS: Significant correlation of the daily new confirmed case count with the weather 3 to 7 days ago were found. SARS-CoV-2 is easy to spread under weather conditions of average temperature at 5 to 15°C, relative humidity at 70% to 80%, wind speed at 1.5 to 4.5 m/s and air visibility less than 10 statute miles. A short-term model with these four meteorological variables was derived to predict the daily increase in COVID-19 cases; and a long-term model using temperature to predict the pandemic in the next week to month was derived. Taken China as a discovery dataset, it was well validated with worldwide data. According to this model, there are five viral transmission patterns, 'restricted', 'controlled', 'natural', 'tropical' and 'southern'. This model's prediction performance correlates with actual observations best (over 0.9 correlation coefficient) under natural spread mode of SARS-CoV-2 when there is not much human interference such as epidemic control. CONCLUSIONS: This model can be used for prediction of the future outbreak, and illustrating the effect of epidemic control for a certain area.","Chen, Biqing; Liang, Hao; Yuan, Xiaomin; Hu, Yingying; Xu, Miao; Zhao, Yating; Zhang, Binfen; Tian, Fang; Zhu, Xuejun",BMJ Open,,210

Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-based epitope prediction and its association with disease outcomes provide an important base for treatment design. A bioinformatic prediction of T cell epitopes and their restricted HLA Class I and II alleles was performed to obtain immunogenic epitopes and HLA alleles from the spike protein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus. Also, a correlation with the predicted fatality rate of hospitalized patients in 28 states of Mexico was done. Here, we describe a set of 10 highly immunogenic epitopes, together with different HLA alleles that can efficiently present these epitopes to T cells. Most of these epitopes are located within the S1 subunit of the spike protein, suggesting that this area is highly immunogenic. A statistical negative correlation was found between the frequency of HLA-DRB1*01 and the fatality rate in hospitalized patients in Mexico.","Romero-López, José Pablo; Carnalla-Cortés, Martha; Pacheco-Olvera, Diana L; Ocampo-Godínez, Juan Moisés; Oliva-Ramírez, Jacqueline; Moreno-Manjón, Julia; Bernal-Alferes, Brian; López-Olmedo, Nancy; García-Latorre, Ethel; Domínguez-López, María Lilia; Reyes-Sandoval, Arturo; Jiménez-Zamudio, Luis",J. med. virol,,210

256593,Anti-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) targets and mechanisms of puerarin,2020,"The ability to perform accurate prognosis of patients is crucial for proactive clinical decision making, informed resource management and personalised care. Existing outcome prediction models suffer from a low recall of infrequent positive outcomes. We present a highly-scalable and robust machine learning framework to automatically predict adversity represented by mortality and ICU admission from time-series vital signs and laboratory results obtained within the first 24 hours of hospital admission. The stacked platform comprises two components: a) an unsupervised LSTM Autoencoder that learns an optimal representation of the time-series, using it to differentiate the less frequent patterns which conclude with an adverse event from the majority patterns that do not, and b) a gradient boosting model, which relies on the constructed representation to refine prediction, incorporating static features of demographics, admission details and clinical summaries. The model is used to assess a patient's risk of adversity over time and provides visual justifications of its prediction based on the patient's static features and dynamic signals. Results of three case studies for predicting mortality and ICU admission show that the model outperforms all existing outcome prediction models, achieving PR-AUC of 0.891 (95$%$ CI: 0.878 - 0.969) in predicting mortality in ICU and general ward settings and 0.908 (95$%$ CI: 0.870-0.935) in predicting ICU admission.","Ibrahim, Zina M; Bean, Daniel; Searle, Thomas; Wu, Honghan; Shek, Anthony; Kraljevic, Zeljko; Galloway, James; Norton, Sam; Teo, James T; Dobson, Richard JB",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.09361v2.pdf,210

A constantly search for market leadership, including Dentistry field and dental materials, stimulates the industries to launch daily new products. Inventions related to health researches are mostly protected by patents as intellectual property. A patent landscape analysis through searches in patent banks is a tool used to identify trends in different areas of innovations. OBJECTIVE: Identify and evaluate the scenario of research, development and innovation of dental products in Argentina by a technological prospecting based on patents. METHODS: A survey of patent documents was conducted by searching for deposited and granted patents of dental products. The searches were carried out during January 2020 in the patent database of the National Institute of Industrial Property of Argentina (INPI-AR). The terms 'dentistry', ""buccal"", 'dental' and ""oral"" were used to select in the titles and abstracts of patent application reports. The information extracted from patent reports was organized in tables and graphs using GraphPad Prism 6 software to evaluate the applications. RESULTS: A total of 363 patents were published from 1989 to 2016, mainly by international industries, 93.3 % as Patent Invention and 3.0 % as a Utility Model applications on Dentistry. Only two patents (0.5 %) were deposited by universities, as University of Melbourne (Patent number 20060102378) and Universidad Nacional del Nordeste (Patent number 20140104149) which only the last one is national. Among the deposits only 6.6 % were granted, the most was in force, denied or lost. According to the specialties, most patents were related to compositions (64.7 %) and personal products (21.7 %), also on Dentistry/Cariology (6.33 %) and Prostheses/Implants (4.68 %). CONCLUSION: In general, we find that the most patent applications are related to the preventive area, personal products and compositions for formulations. Few dental patents deposits are currently available in Argentina, suggesting that the importation of products into the area remains large, which can make dental products more expensive. It is important to invest in technology-based companies to promote increased economic activity, being a consequence of investment in knowledge creation and intellectual property to the Dentistry area.","Marques, Lidia Audrey Rocha Valadas; de Oliveira Filho, Rosueti Diógenes; Lotif, Mara Assef Leitão; Girão, Francisco Josimar; de Alencar, Emmanuel Arraes; Bandeira, Mary Anne Medeiros; Squassi, Aldo",Recent patents on biotechnology (Online),,210

We aimed to assess the more recent nationwide seroprevalence in the general population in India. METHODS: We did a second household serosurvey among individuals aged 10 years or older in the same 700 villages or wards within 70 districts in India that were included in the first serosurvey. Individuals aged younger than 10 years and households that did not respond at the time of survey were excluded. Participants were interviewed to collect information on sociodemographics, symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, exposure history to laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, and history of COVID-19 illness. 3-5 mL of venous blood was collected from each participant and blood samples were tested using the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay. Seroprevalence was estimated after applying the sampling weights and adjusting for clustering and assay characteristics. We randomly selected one adult serum sample from each household to compare the seroprevalence among adults between the two serosurveys. FINDINGS: Between Aug 18 and Sept 20, 2020, we enrolled and collected serum samples from 29â082 individuals from 15â613 households. The weighted and adjusted seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in individuals aged 10 years or older was 6·6% (95% CI 5·8-7·4). Among 15â084 randomly selected adults (one per household), the weighted and adjusted seroprevalence was 7·1% (6·2-8·2). Seroprevalence was similar across age groups, sexes, and occupations. Seroprevalence was highest in urban slum areas followed by urban non-slum and rural areas. We estimated a cumulative 74·3 million infections in the country by Aug 18, 2020, with 26-32 infections for every reported COVID-19 case. INTERPRETATION: Approximately one in 15 individuals aged 10 years or older in India had SARS-CoV-2 infection by Aug 18, 2020. The adult seroprevalence increased approximately tenfold between May and August, 2020. Lower infection-to-case ratio in August than in May reflects a substantial increase in testing across the country.

MERS-CoV causes acute and severe respiratory disease in humans. The mortality rate of MERS in humans is â¼35% and >800 deaths have been reported globally as of August 2020. Dromedary camels are a natural host of the virus and the source of zoonotic human infection. In experimental studies, Bactrian camels are susceptible to MERS-CoV infection similar to dromedary camels; however, neither the virus, viral RNA, nor virus-specific antibodies were detected in Bactrian camel field samples so far. The aim of our study was to survey Mongolian camels for MERS-CoV-specific antibodies. A total of 180 camel sera, collected in 2016 and 2017, were involved in this survey: 17 of 180 sera were seropositive with an initial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test performed at the State Central Veterinary Laboratory in Mongolia. These 17 positive sera plus 53 additional negative sera were sent to the Rocky Mountain Laboratories, NIAID/NIH, and tested for the presence of antibodies with a similar ELISA, an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA), and a virus neutralization test (VNT). In these additional tests, a total of 21 of 70 sera were positive with ELISA and 10 sera were positive with IFA; however, none was positive in the VNT.

It is therefore not always physically possible to treat all the patients who require intensive care, raising major ethical dilemmas related to which patients should benefit from the limited resources and which should not. Here we consider some of the approaches to the acute shortages seen during this and other epidemics, including some guidelines for triaging ICU admissions and treatments.","Vincent, Jean-Louis; Creteur, Jacques",Eur Heart J Acute Cardiovasc Care,,210
261821,Mandatory Coronavirus Disease 2019 Vaccine for Children?,2021,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Using case vignettes, we highlight challenges in communication, prognostication, and medical decision-making that have been exacerbated by the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic for patients with kidney disease. We include best practice recommendations to mitigate these issues and conclude with implications for interdisciplinary models of care in crisis settings. RECENT FINDINGS: Certain biomarkers, demographics, and medical comorbidities predict an increased risk for mortality among patients with COVID-19 and kidney disease, but concerns related to physical exposure and conservation of personal protective equipment have exacerbated existing barriers to empathic communication and value clarification for these patients. Variability in patient characteristics and outcomes has made prognostication nuanced and challenging. The pandemic has also highlighted the complexities of dialysis decision-making for older adults at risk for poor outcomes related to COVID-19. SUMMARY: The COVID-19 pandemic underscores the need for nephrologists to be competent in serious illness communication skills that include virtual and remote modalities, to be aware of prognostic tools, and to be willing to engage with interdisciplinary teams of palliative care subspecialists, intensivists, and ethicists to facilitate goal-concordant care during crisis settings.","Nair, Devika; Malhotra, Sonia; Lupu, Dale; Harbert, Glenda; Scherer, Jennifer S",Curr Opin Nephrol Hypertens,,210
262183,Association between eating behavior and quarantine/confinement stressors during the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak,2020,"Physical distancing has been the primary strategy to control COVID-19 in the United States. We used mobility data from a large, anonymized sample of smartphone users to assess the relationship between neighbourhood income and physical distancing during the pandemic. We found a strong gradient between neighbourhood income and physical distancing. Individuals in high-income neighbourhoods increased their days at home substantially more than individuals in low-income neighbourhoods did. Residents of low-income neighbourhoods were more likely to work outside the home, compared to residents in higher-income neighbourhoods, but were not more likely to visit locations such as supermarkets, parks and hospitals. Finally, we found that state orders were only associated with small increases in staying home in low-income neighbourhoods. Our findings indicate that people in lower-income neighbourhoods have faced barriers to physical distancing, particularly needing to work outside the home, and that state physical distancing policies have not mitigated these disparities.","Jay, Jonathan; Bor, Jacob; Nsoesie, Elaine O; Lipson, Sarah K; Jones, David K; Galea, Sandro; Raifman, Julia",Nat Hum Behav,,210
263668,Analysing secondary infections of coronavirus disease 2019 across the geopolitical zones of Nigeria using estimated time dependent reproduction number,2020,"BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies during the early phase of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemics reported different level of people's risk perception in different countries. There is a paucity of data on perceived high risk of COVID-19 and associated factors in Ethiopia. We sought to assess the prevalence of community's perceived high risk about COVID-19 infections and associated factors among Gondar town community. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out from April 20 to 27, 2020 in Gondar town community, Northwest Ethiopia. Multistage cluster sampling technique was used to recruit 635 participants. Structured and pre-tested questionnaire was used to collect the data. Descriptive statistics, bivariate and multivariable binary logistic regression were used to summarize the results. RESULTS: A total of 623 participants were considered in the analysis with a response rate of 98.1%. The prevalence of coronavirus high risk perceptions of the respondents was found to be 23.11% (95% CI; 19.80%-26.43%). Age above 45 years (AOR = 1.41, 95%CI; 1.19-2.66), college and above educational level (AOR = 0.28, 95%CI; 0.21-0.98), and poor knowledge towards COVID-19 virus (AOR = 1.57, 95%CI; 1.09-2.23) were significantly associated with perceived high risk about COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of perceived high risk of COVID-19 was found to be low. Factors such as age, educational status, and knowledge about COVID-19 virus were found to be independent predictors of perceived high risk towards COVID-19. Government and non-government organizations should use formal and informal means of educating the community.","Kabito, Gebisa Guyasa; Alemayehu, Mekuriaw; Mekonnen, Tesfaye Hambisa; Daba Wami, Sintayehu; Azanaw, Jember; Adane, Tsegaye; Azene, Zelalem Nigussie; Merid, Mehari Woldemariam; Muluneh, Atalay Goshu; Geberu, Demiss Mulatu; Kassa, Getahun Molla; Yenit, Melaku Kindie; Tilahun, Sewbesew Yitayih; Gelaye, Kassahun Alemu; Mekonnen, Habtamu Sewunet; Azagew, Abere Woretaw; Wubneh, Chalachew Adugna; Belay, Getaneh Mulualem; Assimamaw, Nega Tezera; Agegnehu, Chilot Desta; Azale, Telake; Tamiru, Animut Tagele; Rade, Bayew Kelkay; Taye, Eden Bishaw; Taddese, Asefa Adimasu; Andualem, Zewudu; Dagne, Henok; Gashaye, Kiros Terefe",PLoS One,,210

Five different types of falsified chloroquine tablets were discovered between March 31, 2020 and April 4, 2020, in Cameroon and the Democratic Republic of Congo by locally conducted thin layer chromatographic analysis. Subsequent investigation by liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry in Germany proved the absence of detectable amounts of chloroquine and the presence of undeclared active pharmaceutical ingredients, that is, paracetamol and metronidazole, in four of the samples. The fifth sample contained chloroquine, but only 22% of the declared amount. Such products represent a serious risk to patients. Their occurrence exemplifies that once medicines or vaccines against COVID-19 may be developed, falsified products will enter the market immediately, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Timely preparations for the detection of such products are required, including the establishment of appropriate screening technologies in LMICs.","Gnegel, Gesa; Hauk, Cathrin; Neci, Richard; Mutombo, Georges; Nyaah, Fidelis; Wistuba, Dorothee; Häfele-Abah, Christine; Heide, Lutz",Am. j. trop. med. hyg,,210

The amount of aortic wall calcification (AWC) can be estimated on low-dose chest CT. We suggest quantification of AWC on the low-dose chest CT, which is initially performed for the diagnosis of COVID-19, to screen for patients at risk of severe COVID-19. METHODS: Seventy consecutive patients (46 in center 1, 24 in center 2) with parallel low-dose chest CT and positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 were included in our multi-center, multi-vendor study. The outcome was rated moderate (no hospitalization, hospitalization) and severe (ICU, tracheal intubation, death), the latter implying a requirement for intensive care treatment. The amount of AWC was quantified with the CT vendor's software. RESULTS: Of 70 included patients, 38 developed a moderate, and 32 a severe COVID-19. The average volume of AWC was significantly higher throughout the subgroup with severe COVID-19, when compared to moderate cases (771.7 mm3 (Q1 = 49.8 mm3, Q3 = 3065.5 mm3) vs. 0 mm3 (Q1 = 0 mm3, Q3 = 57.3 mm3)). Within multivariate regression analysis, including AWC, patient age and sex, as well as a cardiovascular comorbidity score, the volume of AWC was the only significant regressor for severe COVID-19 (p = 0.004). For AWC > 3000 mm3, the logistic regression predicts risk for a severe progression of 0.78. If there are no visually detectable AWC risk for severe progression is 0.13, only. CONCLUSION: AWC seems to be an independent biomarker for the prediction of severe progression and intensive care treatment of COVID-19 already at the time of patient admission to the hospital; verification in a larger multi-center, multi-vendor study is desired.","Fervers, Philipp; Kottlors, Jonathan; Zopfs, David; Bremm, Johannes; Maintz, David; Safarov, Orkhan; Tritt, Stephanie; Abdullayev, Nuran; Persigehl, Thorsten",PLoS One,,210
265547,Coronavirus disease 2019 associated acute kidney injury – the Indian experience,2021,"Despite of the rapid development of the vaccines against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), it will take several months to have enough doses and the proper infrastructure to vaccinate a good proportion of the world population. In this interim, the accessibility to the Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) may mitigate the pandemic impact in some countries and the BCG vaccine offers significant advantages and flexibility in the way clinical vaccines are administered. BCG vaccination is a highly cost-effective intervention against tuberculosis (TB) and many low-and lower-middle-income countries would likely have the infrastructure, and health care personnel sufficiently familiar with the conventional TB vaccine to mount full-scale efforts to administer novel BCG-based vaccine for COVID-19. This suggests the potential for BCG to overcome future barriers to vaccine roll-out in the countries where health systems are fragile and where the effects of this new coronavirus could be catastrophic. Many studies have reported cross-protective effects of the BCG vaccine toward non-tuberculosis related diseases. Mechanistically, this cross-protective effect of the BCG vaccine can be explained, in part, by trained immunity, a recently discovered program of innate immune memory, which is characterized by non-permanent epigenetic reprogramming of macrophages that leads to increased inflammatory cytokine production and consequently potent immune responses. In this review, we summarize recent work highlighting the potential use of BCG for the treatment respiratory infectious diseases and ongoing SARS-CoV-2 clinical trials. In situations where no other specific prophylactic tools are available, the BCG vaccine could be used as a potential adjuvant, to decrease sickness of SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or to mitigate the effects of concurrent respiratory infections.","Gonzalez-Perez, Maria; Sanchez-Tarjuelo, Rodrigo; Shor, Boris; Nistal-Villan, Estanislao; Ochando, Jordi",Front Immunol,,210

268923,Lung ultrasound in the diagnosis and monitoring of 30 children with coronavirus disease 2019,2021,"BACKGROUND: Vaccines for COVID-19 are currently available for the public in Israel. The compliance with vaccination has differed between sectors in Israel and the uptake has been substantially lower in the Arab compared with the Jewish population. AIM: To assess ethnic and socio-demographic factors in Israel associated with attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccines prior to their introduction. METHODS: A national cross-sectional survey was carried out In Israel during October 2020 using an internet panel of around 100,000 people, supplemented by snowball sampling. A sample of 957 adults aged 30 and over were recruited of whom 606 were Jews (49% males) and 351 were Arabs (38% males). RESULTS: The sample of Arabs was younger than for the Jewish respondents. Among the men, 27.3% of the Jewish and 23.1% of the Arab respondents wanted to be vaccinated immediately, compared with only 13.6% of Jewish women and 12.0% of Arab women. An affirmative answer to the question as to whether they would refuse the vaccine at any stage was given by 7.7% of Jewish men and 29.9% of Arab men, and 17.2% of Jewish women and 41.0% of Arab women. Higher education was associated with less vaccine hesitancy. In multiple logistic regression analysis, the ethnic and gender differences persisted after controlling for age and education. Other factors associated with vaccine hesitancy were the belief that the government restrictions were too lenient and the frequency of socializing prior to the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed a relatively high percentage reported would be reluctant to get vaccinated, prior to the introduction of the vaccine. This was more marked so for Arabs then Jews, and more so for women within the ethnic groups. While this was not a true random sample, the findings are consistent with the large ethnic differences in compliance with the vaccine, currently encountered and reinforce the policy implications for developing effective communication to increase vaccine adherence. Government policies directed at controlling the pandemic should include sector-specific information campaigns, which are tailored to ensure community engagement, using targeted messages to the suspected vaccine hesitant groups. Government ministries, health service providers and local authorities should join hands with civil society organizations to promote vaccine promotion campaigns.","Green, Manfred S; Abdullah, Rania; Vered, Shiraz; Nitzan, Dorit",Isr J Health Policy Res,,210

METHOD AND MATERIALS: In this clinical trial, 46 patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria were randomly divided into two equal groups: group I (n = 22) received IANB in a closed operatory without any fragrance, whereas group II (n = 24) received IANB in a separate closed operatory saturated with lavender fragrance using a candle warmer. The modified dental anxiety scale (MDAS) for anxiety and visual analog scale (VAS) for pain were recorded preoperatively as well as during access cavity preparation. For MDAS, a total score of more than 18 was considered as tremendously anxious or dental phobic. No or mild pain on VAS was considered as success. Data were analyzed using paired t test and independent sample t test. P < .05 was considered as statistically significant. RESULTS: Difference in mean VAS (P = .749) and MDAS (P = 1.000) between both the groups was statistically nonsignificant. However there was a statistically significant difference in mean VAS (P = .000) and MDAS (P = .001) during access opening. CONCLUSION: Lavender aromatherapy can be used successfully to alleviate dental anxiety as well as to increase the anesthetic success rate of IANB in teeth with irreversible pulpitis.","Jadhav, Ganesh R; Mittal, Priya",Quintessence Int,,210

They can be found at scales ranging from our daily routines--such as driving on highways, scheduling meetings, and working collaboratively--to our global challenges--such as peace, commerce, and pandemic preparedness. Arguably, the success of the human species is rooted in our ability to cooperate. Since machines powered by artificial intelligence are playing an ever greater role in our lives, it will be important to equip them with the capabilities necessary to cooperate and to foster cooperation. We see an opportunity for the field of artificial intelligence to explicitly focus effort on this class of problems, which we term Cooperative AI. The objective of this research would be to study the many aspects of the problems of cooperation and to innovate in AI to contribute to solving these problems. Central goals include building machine agents with the capabilities needed for cooperation, building tools to foster cooperation in populations of (machine and/or human) agents, and otherwise conducting AI research for insight relevant to problems of cooperation. This research integrates ongoing work on multi-agent systems, game theory and social choice, human-machine interaction and alignment, natural-language processing, and the construction of social tools and platforms. However, Cooperative AI is not the union of these existing areas, but rather an independent bet about the productivity of specific kinds of conversations that involve these and other areas.

To characterize pre-hospital cardiac arrest careduring COVID-19 in Detroit, we analyzed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) rate of ROSC (return of spontaneous circulation) and patient characteristics before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: OHCA data was analyzed between March 10th, 2020 - April 30th, 2020 and March 10th, 2019 - April 30th, 2019. ROSC, patient demographics, arrest location, initial rhythms, bystander CPR and field termination were compared before and during the pandemic. Descriptive statistics were utilized to compare arrest characteristics between years, and the odds of achieving vs. not achieving ROSC. 2020 vs. 2019 as a predictor for ROSC was assessed with logistic regression. RESULTS: 471 patients were included. Arrests increased to 291 during the pandemic vs. 180 in 2019 (62% increase). Age (mean difference + 6; 95% CI: +2.4 to +9.5), arrest location (nursing home OR = 2.42; 95% CI: 1.42-4.31; public place OR = 0.47; 95% CI: 0.25-0.88), BLS response (OR = 0.68; 95% CI: 0.47-0.99), and field termination of resuscitation (OR = 2.36; 95% CI: 1.36-4.07) differed significantly in 2020 compared to 2019. No significant difference was found in the confounder-adjusted odds of ROSC in 2020 vs 2019 (OR = 0.61; 95% CI: 0.34-1.11). CONCLUSION: OHCA increased by 62% during COVID-19 in Detroit, without a significant change in prehospital ROSC. The rate of ROSC remained similar despite the implementation of an early termination of resuscitation protocol in response to COVID-19.","Mathew, Shobi; Harrison, Nicholas; Chalek, Adam D; Gorelick, Damon; Brennan, Erin; Wise, Stefanie; Gandolfo, Lauren; O039,; Neil, Brian; Dunne, Robert",Am J Emerg Med,,210

However, until now, the duration and clinical implications of antibody-mediated nature immunity in Koreans have remained unknown. Therefore, we examined NAbs levels and clinical characteristics in recovered coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 143 adult patients who had been diagnosed with and had recovered from COVID-19 from February to March in 2020 at a tertiary-care university-affiliated hospital in Daegu, Korea. A plaque reduction neutralization test was conducted to analyze NAb titers. Individualized questionnaires were used to identify patient clinical information. RESULTS: The median number of days from symptom onset to the blood collection date was 109.0 (104.0; 115.0). The NAb titers ranged from 10 to 2560. The median NAb titer value was 40. Of the 143 patients, 68 (47.6%) patients had NAb titers &#8805;80, and 31 (21.7%) patients had NAb titers &#8805;160. The higher the age or disease severity, the higher the NAb titer. In univariate logistic regression, statistically significant predictors of high NAb titers (&#8805;80) were age, myalgia, nausea or vomiting, dyspnea, and disease severity (p<0.05). Multivariable logistic regression showed that age &#8805;50 years (p=0.013) and moderate or higher disease severity (p<0.001) were factors associated with high NAb titers (&#8805;80). None of the patients had reinfection of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: All recovered patients were found to have NAbs regardless of the NAb titers maintained by natural immunity. Age and disease severity during COVID-19 infection were associated with high NAb titers.","Kim, Yoon Jung; Bae, Joon Yong; Bae, Sohyun; Hwang, Soyoon; Kwon, Ki Tae; Chang, Hyun Ha; Lee, Won Kee; Cui, Chunguang; Lee, Gee Eun; Kim, Shin Woo; Park, Man Seong",Yonsei Med J,,210
277078,A Case of Coronavirus Disease 2019 With Concomitant Acute Cerebral Infarction and Deep Vein Thrombosis,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the worldwide need for simple remotely delivered (digital) scalable interventions that can also be used preventatively to protect the mental health of health care staff exposed to psychologically traumatic events during their COVID-19-related work. We have developed a brief behavioral intervention that aims to reduce the number of intrusive memories of traumatic events but has only been delivered face-to-face so far. After digitalizing the intervention materials, the intervention was delivered digitally to target users (health care staff) for the first time. The adaption for staff's working context in a hospital setting used a co-design approach. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this mixed method exploratory pilot study with health care staff who experienced working in the pandemic were to pilot the intervention that we have digitalized (for remote delivery and with remote support) and adapted for this target population (health care staff working clinically during a pandemic) to explore its ability to reduce the number of intrusive memories of traumatic events and improve related symptoms (eg, posttraumatic stress) and participant's perception of their functioning, and to explore the feasibility and acceptability of both the digitalized intervention and digitalized data collection. METHODS: We worked closely with target users with lived experience of working clinically during the COVID-19 pandemic in a hospital context (registered nurses who experienced intrusive memories from traumatic events at work; N=3). We used a mixed method design and exploratory quantitative and qualitative analysis. RESULTS: After completing the digitalized intervention once with remote researcher support (approximately 25 minutes) and a brief follow-up check-in, participants learned to use the intervention independently. All 3 participants reported zero intrusive memories during week 5 (primary outcome: 100% digital data capture). Prior to study inclusion, two or more intrusions in the week were reported preintervention (assessed retrospectively). There was a general pattern of symptom reduction and improvement in perceived functioning (eg, concentration) at follow-up. The digitalized intervention and data collection were perceived as feasible and rated as acceptable (eg, all 3 participants would recommend it to a colleague). Participants were positive toward the digital intervention as a useful tool that could readily be incorporated into work life and repeated in the face of ongoing or repeated trauma exposure. CONCLUSIONS: The intervention when delivered remotely and adapted for this population during the pandemic was well received by participants. Since it could be tailored around work and daily life and used preventatively, the intervention may hold promise for health care staff pending future evaluations of efficacy. Limitations include the small sample size, lack of daily intrusion frequency data in the week before the intervention, and lack of a control condition. Following this co-design process in adapting and improving intervention delivery and evaluation, the next step is to investigate the efficacy of the digitalized intervention in a randomized controlled trial.","Singh, Laura; Kanstrup, Marie; Depa, Katherine; Falk, Ann-Charlotte; Lindström, Veronica; Dahl, Oili; Göransson, Katarina E; Rudman, Ann; Holmes, Emily A",JMIR Form Res,,210

METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis using the Vizient Clinical Data Base. We separately compared two cohorts of patients with COVID-19 admitted April 1-October 31, 2020-patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and those with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)-with control patients with ICH or SAH who did not have COVID-19 admitted at the same hospitals in 2019. The primary outcome was in-hospital death. Favorable discharge and length of hospital and intensive-care stay were the secondary outcomes. We fit multivariate mixed-effects logistic regression models to our outcomes. RESULTS: There were 559 ICH-COVID patients and 23,378 ICH controls from 194 hospitals. In the ICH-COVID cohort versus controls, there was a significantly higher proportion of Hispanic patients (24.5% vs. 8.9%), Black patients (23.3% vs. 20.9%), nonsmokers (11.5% vs. 3.2%), obesity (31.3% vs. 13.5%), and diabetes (43.4% vs. 28.5%), and patients had a longer hospital stay (21.6 vs. 10.5 days), a longer intensive-care stay (16.5 vs. 6.0 days), and a higher in-hospital death rate (46.5% vs. 18.0%). Patients with ICH-COVID had an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 2.43 [1.96-3.00] for the outcome of death and an aOR of 0.55 [0.44-0.68] for favorable discharge. There were 212 SAH-COVID patients and 5,029 controls from 119 hospitals. The hospital (26.9 vs. 13.4 days) and intensive-care (21.9 vs. 9.6 days) length of stays and in-hospital death rate (42.9% vs. 14.8%) were higher in the SAH-COVID cohort compared with controls. Patients with SAH-COVID had an aOR of 1.81 [1.26-2.59] for an outcome of death and an aOR of 0.54 [0.37-0.78] for favorable discharge. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with spontaneous ICH or SAH and comorbid COVID infection were more likely to be a racial or ethnic minority, diabetic, and obese and to have higher rates of death and longer hospital length of stay when compared with controls.","Ravindra, Vijay M; Grandhi, Ramesh; Delic, Alen; Hohmann, Samuel; Shippey, Ernie; Tirschwell, David; Frontera, Jennifer A; Yaghi, Shadi; Majersik, Jennifer J; Anadani, Mohammad; de Havenon, Adam",PLoS One,,210

278928,Torsades de Pointes in Coronavirus Disease 2019 Infection,2020,"OBJECTIVES: There is a lack of research examining how dentists in private practice conceptualise the challenge presented by oral health injustice and how attitudes towards low-income patients might be influenced by the commercial nature of private dental care. This study provides insights into how dentists navigated the interactions between the commercial nature of dental practice and the provision of care to patients who either struggled to (or could not) afford the cost of self-funded care in private practice. METHODS: Participants took part in semi-structured interviews and were invited to keep an online diary of reflections. Thematic analysis was used to examine the data to extract and synthesise understanding of how practitioners conceptualised issues surrounding providing care for the disadvantaged and how this related to the economic realities of private practice. RESULTS: Twenty participants were recruited and interviewed from a variety of private practice environments and roles. This report focuses on one specific theme within the data that explored how participants viewed patients who received public dental care, as well as those privately funded patients who could ill-afford their treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The findings raise how neoliberal attitudes towards oral healthcare and dental disease may act as a social determinant of health and contribute to the sustaining of structural barriers and inaction towards oral health injustice. For low-income patients, practitioners distinguish between (a) those who are deemed to be deserving of professional care and the charitable endeavours of the profession, and (b) those who are not. There appears to be no overt professional obligation to actively work towards the amelioration of oral health injustice.","Holden, A Cl; Adam, L; Thomson, M",Community dent. health,,210

Therefore we investigated whether the time in therapeutic range (TTR) and bleeding complications were affected during the COVID-19 pandemic. 355 patients using warfarin were included between March 2019 to March 2021. Demographic parameters, INR (international normalized ratio), and bleeding rates were recorded retrospectively. The TTR value was calculated using Rosendaal's method. The mean age of the patients was 61 ± 12 years and 55% of them were female. The mean TTR value during the COVID-19 pandemic was lower than the pre-COVID-19 period (56 ± 21 vs 68 ± 21, P < 0.001). Among the patients, 41% had a lack of outpatient INR control. During the COVID-19 pandemic, 71 (20%) patients using VKA suffered bleeding. Among patients with bleeding, approximately 60% did not seek medical help and 6% of patients performed self-reduction of the VKA dose. During the COVID-19 pandemic, TTR values have decreased with the lack of monitoring. Furthermore, the majority of patients did not seek medical help even in case of bleeding.","Emren, Zeynep Yapan; Senöz, Oktay; Erseçgin, Ahmet; Emren, Sadik Volkan",Clin Appl Thromb Hemost,,210

Wildfire incidents can be an ideal environment for the transmission of infectious diseases, particularly for wildland firefighters who congregate in work and living settings. In this review, we examine how exposure to wildfire smoke can contribute to an increased likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Human exposure to particulate matter (PM), a component of wildfire smoke, has been associated with oxidative stress and inflammatory responses; increasing the likelihood for adverse respiratory symptomology and pathology. In multiple epidemiological studies, wildfire smoke exposure has been associated with acute lower respiratory infections, such as bronchitis and pneumonia. Co-occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and wildfire smoke inhalation may present an increased risk for COVID-19 illness in wildland firefighters due to PM based transport of SARS CoV-2 virus and up-regulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE-2) (i.e. ACE-2 functions as a trans-membrane receptor, allowing the SARS-CoV-2 virus to gain entry into the epithelial cell). Wildfire smoke exposure may also increase risk for more severe COVID-19 illness such as cytokine release syndrome, hypotension, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Current infection control measures, including social distancing, wearing cloth masks, frequent cleaning and disinfecting of surfaces, frequent hand washing, and daily screening for COVID-19 symptoms are very important measures to reduce infections and severe health outcomes. Exposure to wildfire smoke may introduce additive or even multiplicative risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity of disease in wildland firefighters. Thus, additional mitigative measures may be needed to prevent the co-occurrence of wildfire smoke exposure and SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Navarro, Kathleen M; Clark, Kathleen A; Hardt, Daniel J; Reid, Colleen E; Lahm, Peter W; Domitrovich, Joseph W; Butler, Corey R; Balmes, John R",Sci Total Environ,,210

Many natural biomolecules (steroid hormones, fatty acids, vitamins) and ~60% of prescribed medications are processed by hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4. The objective of this work was to determine the impact of infection and vaccines on drug metabolism. METHODS: The impact of an adenovirus-based vaccine expressing Ebola glycoprotein (AdEBO) and H1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses on hepatic CYP 3A4 and associated nuclear receptors was evaluated in human hepatocytes (HC-04 cells) and in mice. RESULTS: CYP3A activity was suppressed by 55% in mice 24 h after administration of mouse-adapted H1N1, while Ë10% activity remained in HC-04 cells after infection with H1N1 and H3N2 due to global suppression of cellular translation capacity, indicated by reduction (70%, H1N1, 56%, H3N2) of phosphorylated eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4e (eIF4E). AdEBO suppressed CYP3A activity in vivo (44%) and in vitro (26%) 24 hours after infection. CONCLUSION: As the clinical evaluation of vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 and other global pathogens rise, studies to evaluate the impact of new vaccines and emerging pathogens on CYP3A4 and other metabolic enzymes are warranted to avoid therapeutic failures that could further compromise the public health during infectious disease emergencies.","Jonsson-Schmunk, Kristina; Ghose, Romi; Croyle, Maria A",Expert Rev Vaccines,,210

In this study, we established two RT-RAA assays for the S and orf1ab gene of SARS-CoV-2 using clinical specimens for validation. The analytical sensitivity of the RT-RAA assay was 10 copies for the S and one copy for the orf1ab gene per reaction. Cross-reactions were not observed with any of the other respiratory pathogens. A 100% agreement between the RT-RAA and real-time PCR assays was accomplished after testing 120 respiratory specimens.

RESULTS: Relative to those not receiving diabetes medications, residents taking metformin were at significantly reduced hazard of death [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.48, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.28, 0.84] over the subsequent 30 days from COVID-19 diagnosis. There was no association with insulin (adjusted HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.60, 1.64) or other diabetes medications (adjusted HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.38, 1.32). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Our data suggest a reduction in 30-day mortality following SARS-CoV-2 infection in residents who were on metformin-containing diabetes regimens. These findings suggest a relative survival benefit in nursing home residents on metformin, potentially through its mTOR inhibition effects. A prospective study should investigate the therapeutic benefits of metformin among persons with COVID-19.","Lally, Michelle A; Tsoukas, Philip; Halladay, Christopher W; O039,; Neill, Emily; Gravenstein, Stefan; Rudolph, James L",J Am Med Dir Assoc,,210

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was secondary analysis of Public Data basis on 25 Dec 2020. Statistics included descriptive statistics, analysis of contingency tables, which assessed the value of &#967; 2, the achieved significance level (p). RESULTS: During the first year of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, 8485 cases of COVID-19 were registered in pregnant women in the Far Eastern Federal District and the Siberian Federal District, accounting for 5.9% of registered pregnant women and 1.71% of the total affected population. The morbidity rate in pregnant women was 3.02 times higher than in the general population: 5933.2 vs 1960.8 per 100 thousand population. 27.4% of mothers had asymptomatic disease; 52.7% - mild; 16.6% - moderate, 2.5% - severe, 0.5% - critical disease. The incidence of hospitalization in ICU of pregnant women was higher relative to the general population (3.57% vs 2.24%, p < .001), but the frequency of mechanical ventilation was lower (0.48% vs 1.05%, p < .001). Preterm delivery had 18.3% (p < .001 CS - 42.0%. The mortality rate in pregnant women was 0.14% vs 1.95% - in the general population (p < .001). Perinatal mortality was 37 cases (1.56%), of which there were 31 stillbirths (1.26%), and 6 (0.25%) cases of early neonatal mortality. 148 (6.2%) COVID-19(+) newborns were identified, despite anti-epidemic measures. CONCLUSION: The incidence of COVID-19 in pregnant women in Siberia and the Far East is higher than in the general population, but the disease is characterized by a milder. Women with COVID-19 have a high rate of preterm birth and CS. 148 (6.2%) newborns isolated COVID-19.","Artymuk, Natalia V; Belokrinitskaya, Tatiana E; Filippov, Oleg S; Frolova, Nataly I; Surina, Maria N",J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,,210
287793,Tocilizumab Treatment for Cytokine Release Syndrome in Hospitalized Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019: Survival and Clinical Outcomes,2020,"BACKGROUND: Our study aimed to compare the clinical outcomes of patients with and without diabetes admitted to hospital with COVID-19. METHODS: This retrospective multicentre cohort study comprised 24 tertiary medical centres in France, and included 2851 patients (675 with diabetes) hospitalized for COVID-19 between 26 February and 20 April 2020. A propensity score-matching (PSM) method (1:1 matching including patients' characteristics, medical history, vital statistics and laboratory results) was used to compare patients with and without diabetes (n = 603 per group). The primary outcome was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) and/or in-hospital death. RESULTS: After PSM, all baseline characteristics were well balanced between those with and without diabetes: mean age was 71.2 years; 61.8% were male; and mean BMI was 29 kg/m2. A history of cardiovascular, chronic kidney and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases were found in 32.8%, 22.1% and 6.4% of participants, respectively. The risk of experiencing the primary outcome was similar in patients with or without diabetes [hazard ratio (HR): 1.16, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.95-1.41; P = 0.14], and was 1.29 (95% CI: 0.97-1.69) for in-hospital death, 1.26 (95% CI: 0.9-1.72) for death with no transfer to an ICU and 1.14 (95% CI: 0.88-1.47) with transfer to an ICU. CONCLUSION: In this retrospective study cohort of patients hospitalized for COVID-19, diabetes was not significantly associated with a higher risk of severe outcomes after PSM.

290190,Incorporating a virtual curriculum into ophthalmology education in the coronavirus disease-2019 era,2020,"Viral transmission pathways have profound implications for public safety; thus it is imperative to establish an accurate and complete understanding of viable infectious avenues. Whether SARS-CoV-2 is airborn is currently uncertain. While mounting evidence suggests it could be transmitted via the air in confined spaces, the airborn transmission mode has not yet been demonstrated. Here we show that the quantitative analysis of several reported superspreading events points towards aerosol mediated transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Aerosolized virus emitted by an infected person in an enclosed space will accumulate until virion emission and virion destabilization are balanced, resulting in a steady-state concentration $C_{\infty}$. The timescale to accumulation leads to significantly enhanced exposure when virus-carrying aereosol droplets are inhaled for longer duration co-occupancy. Reported superspreading events are found to trace out a single value of the calculated virion exposure, suggesting a universal minimum infective dose (MID) via aerosol. The MID implied by our analysis is comparable to the measured MIDs for influenza A (H2N2), the virus responsible for the 1957-1958 asian flu pandemic. Our model suggests that the likelihood for aerosol-mediated transmission reduces significantly when there is filtration at a rate exceeding the destabilization rate of aerosolized SARS-CoV-2.","Kolinski, John M.; Schneider, Tobias M.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.14807v2.pdf,210

Currently, the use of hMSCs for various diseases is being investigated in &gt;900 clinical trials. Despite the huge effort, setting up consistent and robust scalable manufacturing to meet regulatory compliance across various global regions remains a nagging challenge. This is in part due to a lack of definitive consensus for quality control checkpoint assays starting from cell isolation to expansion and final release criterion of clinical grade hMSCs. In this review, we highlight the bottlenecks associated with hMSC-based therapies and propose solutions for consistent GMP manufacturing of hMSCs starting from raw materials selection, closed and modular systems of manufacturing, characterization, functional testing, quality control, and safety testing for release criteria.

295265,Remarks About Retrospective Analysis of Ivermectin Effectiveness on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (ICON Study),2021,"PURPOSE: Since many different rates have been reported in the literature and the studies conducted are mostly based on the patient anamnesis, it was aimed to analyze the olfactory dysfunction in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) quantitatively and to reveal its progress by time. METHODS: Patients who described new-onset olfactory dysfunction, who were treated in the COVID-19 departments of our hospital and whose PCR tests demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 presence were included in the study and they were investigated prospectively. Clinical information of all the patients was taken and the levels of olfactory function were detected using the Brief Smell Identification Test (BSIT). Scores equal to or below 8 are considered as olfactory dysfunction. Patients who were followed up for 3 months were reevaluated with the BSIT test at the end of the third month and the progression of the symptom was investigated. RESULTS: The mean BSIT test score of the 42 patients (23 female patients, 19 male patients, mean age: 41.2 ± 14.6) was 5.2 ± 2.2. There was severe olfactory dysfunction in 16.7% of the patients (0-2 points), moderate olfactory dysfunction in 31% (3-5 points), and mild olfactory dysfunction in 52.4% (6-8 points). After a follow-up for 3 months, full recovery was observed in 36 patients (85.7%) and the mean test score rose to 9.9 ± 1.8. Although olfactory dysfunction persisted in 6 patients, an elevation in test scores was noted. Olfactory dysfunction was the first symptom in 17 patients (40%) and the other symptoms occurred after 2 days (1-6) on average. CONCLUSION: We investigated olfactory dysfunction caused by COVID-19 using BSIT, and found a high rate of moderate-mild level symptoms with a high level of recovery in the 3-month follow-up. The finding revealing that olfactory dysfunction was the first symptom in 40% of the patients suggests the importance of inquiry on olfactory functions for the early diagnosis of the disease.","Ugurlu, Burak Numan; Akdogan, Ozlem; Yilmaz, Yasemin Ari; Yapar, Derya; Aktar Ugurlu, Gulay; Yerlikaya, Huseyin Serdar; Aslan Felek, Sevim",Eur. arch. oto-rhino-laryngol,,210

We discuss how current COVID-19 pandemic-related policies are likely to harm older adults disproportionately. COVID-19 pandemic social distancing policies and ethical guidelines for COVID-19 treatment may exacerbate experiences of social isolation, perceived expendability, and exposure to suffering, which are related to the 3 main components of the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide (i.e., thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness to society, and capability for suicide). The COVID-19 pandemic poses a drain on services and has drawn ethical debates about policies around treating younger adults first. These experiences may lead older adults to have reduced access to needed medical and psychiatric services and may convey damaging messages of expendability. Furthermore, the potential prolonged stress associated with the COVID-19 pandemic may affect neurological, immunological, and health functioning-exacerbating suicide risk. Potential venues to increase treatment options and decrease social isolation are discussed.

295886,Self-Performed Lung Ultrasound for Home Monitoring of a Patient Positive for Coronavirus Disease 2019,2020,"Due to their immunomodulatory potential and release of trophic factors that promote healing, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are considered important players in tissue homeostasis and regeneration. MSCs have been widely used in clinical trials to treat multiple conditions associated with inflammation and tissue damage. Recent evidence suggests that most of the MSC therapeutic effects are derived from their secretome, including the extracellular vesicles, representing a promising approach in regenerative medicine application to treat organ failure as a result of inflammation/fibrosis. The recent outbreak of respiratory syndrome coronavirus, caused by the newly identified agent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has forced scientists worldwide to use all available instruments to fight the infection, including the inflammatory cascade caused by this pandemic disease. The use of MSCs is a valid approach to combat organ inflammation in different compartments. In addition to the lungs, which are considered the main inflammatory target for this virus, other organs are compromised by the infection. In particular, the liver is involved in the inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which causes organ failure, leading to death in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. We herein summarize the current implications derived from the use of MSCs and their soluble derivatives in COVID-19 treatment, and emphasize the potential of MSC-based therapy in this clinical setting.","Chinnici, Cinzia Maria; Russelli, Giovanna; Bulati, Matteo; Miceli, Vitale; Gallo, Alessia; Busà, Rosalia; Tinnirello, Rosaria; Conaldi, Pier Giulio; Iannolo, Gioacchin",World J Gastroenterol,,210

It explored the nature and dimensions of problems the faculty members faced, resources used to make sense of problems encountered, and actions they took to solve the problems as reflective practitioners in emergency online teaching. It also examined differences between faculty members over time. Analysis of seven weeks of autobiographic reflective journals during a 10-week academic term revealed that the faculty members encountered a range of problems during the classes, especially student-related and technology-related issues. When encountering problems, faculty members utilized references such as their past experience in face-to-face classroom teaching. Faculty members with more online teaching experience were more adaptable and flexible in mobilizing other references to solve problems. Overall, all members worked as reflective learners and practitioners who continued to reflect on the problems they faced and find solutions. These findings suggest that engaging in reflection-in-action and reflection-on-action can be effective ways for faculty members to develop their competencies to solve problems in emergency online teaching situations when responding to unprecedented challenges and issues is continuously needed.","Jung, Insung Omori Sawa Dawson Walter P.; Yamaguchi, Tomiko Lee Seunghun J.",International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher Education,,210
296826,"Clinical, molecular, and epidemiological characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), a comprehensive literature review",2020,"The transport of oxygen between blood and tissue is limited by blood's capillary transit time, understood as the time available for diffusion exchange before blood returns to the heart. If all capillaries contribute equally to tissue oxygenation at all times, this physical limitation would render vasodilation and increased blood flow insufficient means to meet increased metabolic demands in the heart, muscle, and other organs. In 1920, Danish physiologist August Krogh was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his mathematical and quantitative, experimental demonstration of a solution to this conceptual problem: capillary recruitment, the active opening of previously closed capillaries to meet metabolic demands. Today, capillary recruitment is still mentioned in textbooks. When we suspect symptoms might represent hypoxia of a vascular origin, however, we search for relevant, flow-limiting conditions in our patients and rarely ascribe hypoxia or hypoxemia to short capillary transit times. This review describes how natural changes in capillary transit-time heterogeneity (CTH) and capillary hematocrit (HCT) across open capillaries during blood flow increases can account for a match of oxygen availability to metabolic demands in normal tissue. CTH and HCT depend on a number of factors: on blood properties, including plasma viscosity, the number, size, and deformability of blood cells, and blood cell interactions with capillary endothelium; on anatomical factors including glycocalyx, endothelial cells, basement membrane, and pericytes that affect the capillary diameter; and on any external compression. The review describes how risk factor- and disease-related changes in CTH and HCT interfere with flow-metabolism coupling and tissue oxygenation and discusses whether such capillary dysfunction contributes to vascular disease pathology.","Østergaard, Leif",J Appl Physiol (1985),,210

We determined the seroprevalence against SARS-CoV-2 in all health care workers (HCW) at a hospital. METHODS: Cross-sectional study (14-27/04/2020). We determined SARS-CoV-2 IgG by ELISA in all HCW including external workers of a teaching hospital in Madrid. They were classified by professional category, working area, and risk for SARS-CoV-2 exposure. RESULTS: Among 2919 HCW, 2590 (88,7%) were evaluated. The mean age was 43.8 years (SD 11.1), and 73.9% were females. Globally, 818 (31.6%) workers were IgG positive with no differences for age, sex or previous diseases. Of these, 48.5% did not report previous symptoms. Seropositivity was more frequent in high- (33.1%) and medium- (33.8%) than in low-risk areas (25.8%, p=0.007), but not for hospitalization areas attending COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients (35.5 vs 38.3% p>0.05). HWC with a previous SARS-CoV2 PCR-positive test were IgG seropositive in 90.8%. By multivariate logistic regression analysis seropositivity was significantly associated with being physicians (OR 2.37, CI95% 1.61-3.49), nurses (OR 1.67, CI95% 1.14-2.46), nurse assistants (OR 1.84, CI95% 1.24-2.73), HCW working at COVID-19 hospitalization areas (OR 1.71, CI95% 1.22-2.40), non-COVID-19 hospitalization areas (OR 1.88, CI95% 1.30-2.73), and at the Emergency Room (OR 1.51, CI95% 1.01-2.27).

At the level of the ensembles, forming a part of the modular network, these are constituted by a set of modules, which are nonlinear autoregressive neural networks that are designed to be efficient predictors under particular conditions for each country. In each ensemble, the results of the modules are combined with an aggregator to achieve a better and improved result for the ensemble. Publicly available datasets of coronavirus cases around the globe from the last months have been used in the analysis. Interesting conclusions have been obtained that could be helpful in deciding the best strategies in dealing with this virus for countries in their fight against the coronavirus pandemic. In addition, the proposed approach could be helpful in proposing strategies for similar countries.","Melin, Patricia; Monica, Julio Cesar; Sanchez, Daniela; Castillo, Oscar",Soft comput,,210
297757,Journal Club: The Intersection of Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Coronavirus Disease 2019 and COPD,2021,"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute respiratory syndrome, reported at the end of 2019 in China originally and immediately spread affecting over ten million world population to date. This pandemic is more lethal for the older population and those who previously suffered from other ailments such as cardiovascular diseases, respiratory disorders, and other immune system affecting abnormalities including cancers. Lung cancer is an important comorbidity of COVID-19. In this review, we emphasized the impact of lung tumor microenvironment (TME) on the possibility of enhanced severity of infection caused by the SARS-Co-V2. The compromised lung TME is further susceptible to the attack of viruses. The lung cells are also abundant in the virus entry receptors. Several SARS-Co-V2 proteins can modulate the lung TME by disrupting the fragile immune mechanisms contributing to cytokine storming and cellular metabolic variations. We also discussed the impact of medication used for lung cancer in the scenario of this infection. Since other respiratory infections can be a risk factor for lung cancer, COVID-19 recovered patients should be monitored for tumor development, especially if there is genetic susceptibility or it involves exposure to other risk factors.","Malkani, Naila; Rashid, Muhammad Usman",Mol.

298554,Will the current coronavirus disease 2019 affect progress in the attainment of sustainable development goals in Africa?,2020,"BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has extraordinarily impacted global healthcare. Neuro-oncological surgery units have peculiar features that make them highly relevant in the strategic reaction to the pandemic. In this Chinese Society of Neuro-Oncology (CSNO) initiated survey, we appraise the changes implemented in neuro-oncological surgery hospitals across different Asian countries and provide expert recommendations for responses at different stages of the pandemic. METHODS: We performed a 42-question survey of the early experience of neuro-oncological surgery practice in hospitals across different Asian countries on April 1, 2020, with responses closed on April 18, 2020. RESULTS: 144 hospitals completed the questionnaire. Most were in WHO post-peak phase of the pandemic and reported a median reduction in neuro-oncological surgery volume of 25-50%. Most (67.4%) resumed elective surgery in only COVID-19 negative patients;11.1% performed only emergency cases irrespective of COVID-19 status;2.1% suspended all surgical activity. Ninety-one (63.2%) relocated personnel from neurosurgery to other departments. Fifty-two (36.1%) hospitals suspended post-operative adjuvant therapy and 94 (65.2%) instituted different measures to administer post-operative adjuvant therapy. Majority (59.0%) of the hospitals suspended research activity. Most (70%) respondents anticipate that current neurosurgery restrictions will continue to remain for > 1 month. CONCLUSIONS: Majority of the respondents to our survey reported reduced neuro-oncological surgery activity, policy modification, personnel reallocation, and curtailment of educational/research activities in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The persistent widespread interruption of surgical neuro-oncology in even post-peak phases of the pandemic raises serious concerns about the long-term impact of the pandemic on neuro-oncological patients and highlights the essence of timely measures for pandemic preparedness, patient triage, and workforce protection.","Hameed, N U Farrukh; Ma, Yixin; Zhen, Zili; Wu, Shuai; Feng, Rui; Li, Weiping; Huang, Guodong; Wu, Jinsong; Chen, Zhongping",BMC Surg,,210
299601,"Prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of VTE in patients with coronavirus disease 2019",2020,"OBJECTIVES: There is little information about Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) management for critically ill patients. Most of these patients develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to excessive inflammatory response and the ensuing cytokine storm. Anti-inflammatory drugs including corticosteroids can be used to effectively reduce the effect of this cytokine storm and lung damage. However, corticosteroids can have side effects, so simultaneous administration of immunoglobulin (IV-IG) and interferon-beta can help manage treatment using corticosteroids. Therefore, we designed a trial to test our hypothesis that early administration of dexamethasone in combination with IV-IG and interferon-beta can reduce the effect of the cytokine storm in critically ill patients COVID-19. TRIAL DESIGN: A phase two multi-center randomized controlled trial (RCT) with three parallel arms (1:1:1 ratio). PARTICIPANTS: They will be hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 who have positive RT-PCR test and have blood oxygen saturation levels (SpO2) less than 90% and respiratory rate higher than 24 per minute or have involvement of more than 50% of their lung when viewed using computed tomography (CT)-scan. The age range of patients will be 18-70 years old. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: the need for intubation; allergy, intolerance, or contraindication to any study drug including dexamethasone, IV-IG, and interferon-beta; pregnancy or lactation; known HIV positive or active hepatitis B or C. The study will be conducted in several hospitals of the Golestan province, Iran. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: The study subjects will be randomly allocated to three treatment arms: two experimental groups (two arms: Intervention 1 and Intervention 2) and one Control Group, which will be matched for age and sex using frequency matching method. Each eligible patient in the control arm will receive the standard treatment for COVID-19 based on WHO guidelines and the Ministry of the Health and Medical Education (MOHME) of Iran. Each patient in the Intervention Group 1 will receive the standard treatment for COVID-19 and dexamethasone, at the first 24 hours' time of admission. The intervention begins with the administration of dexamethasone based on the SpO2 levels. If the level of SpO2 does not improve after 24 hours, IV-IG (400 mg/kg once daily for 5 days) and interferon-beta (7 doses every other day) will be prescribed along with dexamethasone administration. In Intervention Group 2, the administration of dexamethasone will be started within the first 24 hours' time of admission and will be continued for 48-72 hours and then the SpO2 level will be checked. Then, if the level of SpO2 has not improved after that time, IV-IG and interferon-beta will be prescribed as the same dosage as Group 1. If the percentages of the SpO2 level are between 85 and 90/ 80 and 85/ 75 and 80/ less than 75, the dosages will be 4 mg every 12 hours/ 4 mg every 8 hours/ 8 mg every 12 hours/ 8 mg every 8 hours, respectively. According to the WHO recommendation, all participants will have the best available supportive care with full monitoring. MAIN OUTCOMES: Primary: An increase in the SpO2 level to reach more than 90% in each case, which will be assessed by the oximeter. Secondary: The duration of hospital stays; intubation status and the percentage of patients who are free of mechanical ventilation; the mortality rates during hospitalization and one month after the admission time. RANDOMISATION: Participants will be allocated into either control or intervention groups with a 1:1:1 allocation ratio using a computer random number generator to generate a table of random numbers for simple randomization. BLINDING (MASKING): The project's principal investigator (PI) is unblinded. However, the PI will not analyse the data and interpret the results. An unblinded researcher (a pharmacist) will cover the drug's bottles with aluminium foil and prepare them interventions and control drugs in a syringe with a code so that patients are blinded. This person will have no patients contact. The staff and nurses, caring for the patients, will be unblinded for each study group due to the nature of this study. The staff that take outcome measurements will be blinded. The laboratory technicians will also be blinded as well as the statistical team. These study statisticians will have access to coded data and will analyse the data labelled as group X, group Y, and group Z. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): The target sample size will be 105 critically ill COVID-19 patients, who will be allocated randomly to the three trial arms with 35 patients in each group. TRIAL STATUS: Recruitment is ongoing. The study began on April 18 2020 and will be completed June 19 2020. This summary describes protocol version 1; April 2 2020.

300568,Development and Validation of the HNC-LL Score for Predicting the Severity of Coronavirus Disease 2019,2020,"BACKGROUND: The exact prevalence and impact of cardiac injury in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is still controversial. Hence, we aim to investigate prevalence of cardiac injury and its impact on the outcomes in patients with COVID-19. HYPOTHESIS: Cardiac injury is common and associated with higher risk of death. METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Library, PubMed, MedRxiv, and EMBASE databases from December 2019 to July 15, 2020 for studies that evaluated the prevalence and impact of cardiac injury on COVID-19. This study has been registered with PROSPERO (International prospective register of systematic reviews)-registration number-CRD-42020186120. RESULTS: Twenty-one studies including 6297 participants were identified. The proportions of cardiac injury were 22%, 28% among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 or severe COVID-19 patients, respectively. The incidences of cardiac injury in advance age (>60 years) (30%) was about two-fold than young patients (<60 years) (15%) with COVID-19. Severe cases (42%) have seven-fold prevalence cardiac injury than in their non- severe counterparts (6%). Furthermore, cardiac injury is associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality in patients with COVID-19 (OR 10.11, 95% CI 4.49-22.77). In patients with severe COVID-19, cardiac injury is associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality (OR: 16.79, 95% CI: 5.52-51.02). CONCLUSIONS: This was the first meta-analysis exploring the prevalence and impact of cardiac injury on COVID-19. Cardiac injury is common in hospitalized patients and advanced age and severe COVID-19 patients prone to experience more risk of cardiac injury. Furthermore, cardiac injury is associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality.","Fu, Linghua; Liu, Xiao; Su, Yuhao; Ma, Jianyong; Hong, Kui",Clin Cardiol,,210
301549,Prevention and Treatment of Venous Thromboembolism Associated with Coronavirus Disease 2019 Infection: A Consensus Statement before Guidelines,2020,"Purpose: In order to provide guidance and prepare ward managers for future crisis situations similar to the COVID-19 pandemic, the aim of this study was to reflect and learn how person-centred nursing leadership may be strengthened in such situations. Background: The pandemic has forced nurse leaders to face new challenges. Knowledge about their experiences may contribute to advancing leadership practices in times of future crises. Methods: A qualitative directed content analysis was chosen. The theoretical perspective was person-centred leadership. Thirteen ward managers from a Danish university hospital were included and interviewed using telephone interviews three months after the first national COVID-19 case was confirmed. Findings: The main findings of the study revealed that the ward managers often experienced a lack of timely, relevant information, involvement in decision-making and acknowledgement from the head nurse of department and the executive management. This was caused by the existing organizational cultures and the traditional hierarchy of communication. This meant that the ward managers' sense of own competences and leadership values and beliefs came under high pressure when they had to balance different stakeholders' needs. Conclusion: When the experience of ward managers results in them being unable to lead authentically and competently in a crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic, lack of engagement can occur, with serious consequences for patients, staff and the ward managers themselves. Traditional organizational cultures that are hierarchical and controlling needs to be challenged and reoriented towards collaborative, inclusive and participative practices of engagement and involvement. Leadership development must be an established and integrated component of organizations, so that ward managers are able to sustain person-centred ways of being and doing in times of crisis.","Holge-Hazelton, B.; Kjerholt, M.; Rosted, E.; Hansen, S.

302142,Predictive factors of smell recovery in a clinical series of 288 coronavirus disease 2019 patients with olfactory dysfunction,2021,"Confronting the pandemic of COVID-19 caused by the new coronavirus, the SARS-CoV-2, is nowadays one of the most prominent challenges of the human species. A key factor in slowing down the virus propagation is the rapid diagnosis and isolation of infected patients. Nevertheless, the standard method for COVID-19 identification, the Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method, is time-consuming and in short supply due to the pandemic. Researchers around the world have been looking for alternative screening methods. In this context, deep learning applied to chest X-rays of patients has been showing promising results in the identification of COVID-19. Despite their success, the computational cost of these methods remains high, which imposes difficulties in their accessibility and availability. Thus, in this work, we propose to explore and extend the EfficientNet family of models using chest X-rays images to perform COVID-19 detection. As a result, we can produce a high-quality model with an overall accuracy of 93.9%, COVID-19, sensitivity of 96.8% and positive prediction of 100% while having about 30 times fewer parameters than the baseline literature model, 28 and 5 times fewer parameters than the popular VGG16 and ResNet50 architectures, respectively. We believe the reported figures represent state-of-the-art results, both in terms of efficiency and effectiveness, for the COVIDx database, a database comprised of 13,800 X-ray images, 183 of which are from patients affected by COVID-19.","Luz, Eduardo; Silva, Pedro Lopes; Silva, Rodrigo; Silva, Ludmila; Moreira, Gladston; Menotti, David",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.05717v2.pdf,210

With this study, we sought to survey pediatric centers and highlight the variations in care related to perioperative medicine during the COVID-19 pandemic, including the availability of protective equipment, the practice of pediatric anesthesia, and economic impact. AIM: The aim of the survey was to determine how COVID-19 directly impacted pediatric anesthesia practices during the study period. METHODS: A survey concerning four major domains (testing, safety, clinical management/policy, economics) was developed. It was pilot tested for clarity and content by members of the Pediatric Anesthesia COVID-19 Collaborative. The survey was administered by email to all Pediatric Anesthesia COVID-19 Collaborative members on September 1, 2020. Respondents had six weeks to complete the survey and were instructed to answer the questions based on their institution's practice during September 1 - October 13, 2020. RESULTS: Sixty-three institutions (100% response rate) participated in the COVID-19 Pediatric Anesthesia Survey. Forty-one hospitals (65%) were from the United States, and 35% included other countries. N95 masks were available to anesthesia teams at 91% of institutions (n = 57) (95% CI: 80%-96%). COVID-19 testing criteria of anesthesia staff and guidelines to return to work varied by institution. Structured simulation training aimed at improving COVID-19 safety and patient care occurred at 62% of institutions (n = 39). Pediatric anesthesiologists were economically affected by a reduction in their employer benefits and restriction of travel due to employer imposed quarantine regulations. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the testing, safety, clinical management, and economics of pediatric anesthesia practice.

LC model (LCM) uses dimension reduction for fitting to the log mortality matrix so that the performance of the dimension reduction method may not be good when the matrix structure changes. On the other hand, 4-parametric factor model (4-PFM) is designed to use factors for fitting to log mortality data by age groups so that it would be less affected by the change of the mortality structure. In fact, the forecast accuracies of LCM are better than those of 4-PFM when life-tables are used whereas those of 4-PFM are better when the mortality structure changes. Thus this result shows that 4-PFM is more reliable in performance to the structural changes of the mortality.

This study aims to describe the responses from the health information systems (HIS) to the COVID-19 pandemic and provide empirical evidence in the application of emerging health technologies in China. METHODS: This observational descriptive study utilized a nationally representative, cross-sectional survey of hospitals in China (N = 1,014) from 30 provincial administrative regions across the country. Participants include hospital managers, hospital information workers, and health care providers. RESULTS: Among all the responses, the most popular interventions and applications include expert question-and-answer sessions and science popularization (61.74%) in online medical consultation, online appointment registration (58.97%) in online medical service, and remote consultation (75.15%) in telehealth service. A total of 63.71% of the participating hospitals expanded their fever clinics during the pandemic, 15.38% hospitals used new or upgraded mobile ward rounds systems, and 44.68% hospitals applied online self-service systems. Challenges and barriers include protecting network information security (57.00%) since some hospitals experienced cybersecurity incidents. 71.79% participants hope to shorten wait time and optimize the treatment process. Health care workers experienced increased amount of work during the pandemic, while hospital information departments did not experience significant changes in their workload. CONCLUSION: In the process of fighting against the COVID-19, hospitals have widely used traditional and emerging novel HITs. These technologies have strengthened the capacity of prevention and control of the pandemic and provided comprehensive information technology support while also improving accessibility and efficiency of health care delivery.","Ye, Jiancheng",Appl Clin Inform,,210

Group 1 was formed of patients with normal liver biochemical parameters values;Group 2 was formed of patients with liver biochemical parameters abnormality;Group 3 was formed of patients with liver injury. Results 353 (66.2%) of all patients died. Neutrophil, aPTT, CRP, LDH, CK, ALT, AST, bilirubin, procalcitonin and ferritin values in Group 2 and Group 3 were found to be statistically significantly higher than Group 1. It was detected that the days of stay in ICU of the patients in Group 1 was statistically significantly longer than others group. It was found that the patients in Groups 2 and 3 had higher total, 7-day, and 28-day mortality rates than expected. Conclusions The study showed that liver disfunction was associated with higher mortality and shorter ICU occupation time.","Salık, Fikret Uzundere Osman Bıçak Mustafa Akelma Hakan Akgündüz Mesut Korhan Zeki Kandemir Deniz Kaçar Cem Kıvılcım",Annals of hepatology,,210

To identify non-specific blood tests and risk factors as predictors of hospitalisation due to COVID-19, one has to exclude noisy predictors by comparing the concordance statistics (area under the curve - AUC) for positive and negative cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Predictors with significant AUC at negative stratum should be either controlled for their confounders or eliminated (when confounders are unavailable). Models were classified according to the difference of AUC between strata. The framework was applied to an open database with 5644 patients from Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein in Brazil with SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) exam. C-reactive protein (CRP) was a noisy predictor: hospitalisation could have happened due to causes other than COVID-19 even when SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR is positive and CRP is reactive, as most cases are asymptomatic to mild. Candidates of characteristic response from moderate-to-severe inflammation of COVID-19 were: combinations of eosinophils, monocytes and neutrophils, with age as risk factor; and creatinine, as risk factor, sharpens the odds ratio of the model with monocytes, neutrophils and age.","Ishikawa, G; Argenti, G; Fadel, C B",Epidemiol Infect,,210

Emergency disposal scenarios of medical waste generated during the COVID-19 pandemic require a systematic assessment to quantify their potential environmental impacts. The environmental impacts and key factors of three movable disposal scenarios (i.e. incineration disposal vehicle, movable steam and microwave sterilization equipment both followed by co-incineration with municipal solid waste) were quantified via life cycle assessment approach. Furthermore, the environmental impacts of three movable disposal and two co-incineration scenarios were compared via life cycle assessment by expanding system boundaries. The results show that co-incineration with municipal solid waste has the lowest environmental impacts due to environmental benefits produced by power generation, while co-incineration with hazardous waste is the highest due to the high energy consumption. Energy consumption (i.e. kerosene, electricity and diesel) are the key factors for three movable disposal scenarios. For movable steam and microwave sterilization equipment followed by co-incineration with municipal solid waste, power generation from incinerating disinfected medical waste has significant beneficial environmental impacts due to avoided impacts of electricity consumption. The recommendations for improvement of the emergency disposal and management of medical waste during the COVID-19 pandemic globally and other serious epidemic in the future are provided.","Zhao, Hailong; Liu, HanQiao; Wei, Guoxia; Wang, Hongtao; Zhu, Yuwen; Zhang, Rui; Yang, Yong",Waste Manag,,210

320716,Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Gastroenterologist's Perspective in May 2020,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Diabetes is associated with adverse outcomes, including death, after coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) infection. Beyond the lungs, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiologic agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, can infect a range of other tissues, including the kidney, potentially contributing to acute kidney injury in those with severe disease. We hypothesized that the renal abundance of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2, the cell surface receptor for SARS-CoV-2, may be modulated by diabetes and agents that block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). METHODS: The expression of ACE 2 was examined in 49 archival kidney biopsies from patients with diabetic kidney disease and from 12 healthy, potential living allograft donors using next-generation sequencing technology (RNA Seq). RESULTS: Mean ACE 2 messenger RNA was increased approximately 2-fold in diabetes when compared with healthy control subjects (mean ± SD, 13.2±7.9 vs 7.7±3.6 reads per million reads, respectively; p=0.001). No difference in transcript abundance was noted between recipients and nonrecipients of agents that block the RAAS (12.2±6.7 vs 16.2±10.7 reads per million reads, respectively; p=0.25). CONCLUSIONS: Increased ACE 2 messenger RNA in the diabetic kidney may increase the risk and/or severity of kidney infection with SARS-CoV-2 in the setting of COVID-19 disease. Further studies are needed to ascertain whether this diabetes-related overexpression is generalizable to other tissues, most notably the lungs.","Gilbert, Richard E; Caldwell, Lauren; Misra, Paraish S; Chan, Kin; Burns, Kevin D; Wrana, Jeffrey L; Yuen, Darren A",,,210

Many guidelines have been developed for treating children with COVID-19. The quality of the existing guidelines and the consistency of recommendations remains unknown. Therefore, we aim to review the clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for children with COVID-19 systematically. Methods: We systematically searched Medline, Embase, guideline-related websites, and Google. The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II) tool and Reporting Items for practice Guidelines in HealThcare (RIGHT) checklist were used to evaluate the methodological and reporting quality of the included guidelines, respectively. The consistency of recommendations across the guidelines and their supporting evidence were analyzed. Results: Twenty guidelines were included in this study. The mean AGREE II score and mean RIGHT reporting rate of the included guidelines were 37% (range, 22-62%) and 52% (range, 31-89%), respectively. As for methodological quality, no guideline was classified as high, one guideline (5%) moderate, and 19 (95%) low. In terms of reporting quality, one guideline (5%) was rated as high, 12 guidelines (60%) moderate, and seven (35%) low. Among included guidelines, recommendations varied greatly in the use of remdesivir (recommend: 25%, not recommend: 45%, not report: 30%), interferon (recommend: 15%, not recommend: 50%, not report: 35%), glucocorticoids (recommend: 50%, not recommend: 20%, not report: 30%), and intravenous immune globulin (recommend: 35%, not recommend: 30%, not report: 35%). None of the guidelines cited clinical trials from children with COVID-19. Conclusions: The methodological and reporting quality of guidelines for treating children with COVID-19 was not high. Recommendations were inconsistent across different guidelines. The supporting evidence from children with COVID-19 was very limited.","Li, Q.; Zhou, Q.; Xun, Y.; Liu, H.; Shi, Q.; Wang, Z.; Zhao, S.; Liu, X.; Liu, E.; Fu, Z.; Chen, Y.; Luo, Z.",Annals of Translational Medicine,,210
321333,Indicators of acute kidney injury as biomarkers to differentiate heatstroke from coronavirus disease 2019: A retrospective multicenter analysis,2020,"ABSTRACT: Postacute COVID-19 patients are at risk of long-term functional impairment, and the rehabilitation community is calling for action preparing for a ""tsunami of rehabilitation needs"" in this patient population. In the absence of standard guidelines and local evidence, a 3-wk pulmonary telerehabilitation program was successfully delivered to a postacute severe COVID-19 patient in Malawi. The patient experienced persistent dyspnea and fatigue, with a remarkable impact on his health status. On the final assessment, all his respiratory severity scores had fallen by more than their thresholds for clinical significance. He reported no continued or new complaints, was walking longer distances, had returned to work, and was discharged from follow-up. Our case shows that an improvised pulmonary telerehabilitation program for postacute COVID-19 patients could be feasible and acceptable in a low-resource setting. Benefits include reducing risk of transmission and use of personal protective equipment.","Bickton, Fanuel Meckson; Chisati, Enock; Rylance, Jamie; Morton, Ben",Am J Phys Med Rehabil,,210

We find that sunlight strongly protects against getting influenza. This relationship is driven almost entirely by the severe H1N1 epidemic in fall 2009. A 10% increase in relative sunlight decreases the influenza index in September or October by 1.1 points on a 10-point scale.

321483,Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Pregnancy: A Clinical Management Protocol and Considerations for Practice,2020,"The novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a highly contagious virus and has spread all over the world, posing an extremely serious threat to all countries. Automatic lung infection segmentation from computed tomography (CT) plays an important role in the quantitative analysis of COVID-19. However, the major challenge lies in the inadequacy of annotated COVID-19 datasets. Currently, there are several public non-COVID lung lesion segmentation datasets, providing the potential for generalizing useful information to the related COVID-19 segmentation task. In this paper, we propose a novel relation-driven collaborative learning model to exploit shared knowledge from non-COVID lesions for annotation-efficient COVID-19 CT lung infection segmentation. The model consists of a general encoder to capture general lung lesion features based on multiple non-COVID lesions, and a target encoder to focus on task-specific features based on COVID-19 infections. Features extracted from the two parallel encoders are concatenated for the subsequent decoder part. We develop a collaborative learning scheme to regularize feature-level relation consistency of given input and encourage the model to learn more general and discriminative representation of COVID-19 infections. Extensive experiments demonstrate that trained with limited COVID-19 data, exploiting shared knowledge from non-COVID lesions can further improve state-of-the-art performance with up to 3.0% in dice similarity coefficient and 4.2% in normalized surface dice. Our proposed method promotes new insights into annotation-efficient deep learning for COVID-19 infection segmentation and illustrates strong potential for real-world applications in the global fight against COVID-19 in the absence of sufficient high-quality annotations.","Zhang, Yichi; Liao, Qingcheng; Yuan, Lin; Zhu, He; Xing, Jiezhen; Zhang, Jicong",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.15564v2.pdf,210

Between April and June 2020, 46% of respondents changed treatment plans for more than 25% of their cancer patients due to the pandemic. Clinicians report broad use of interim funding measures. The most frequently reported strategies used were treatment breaks for stable patients (62%), extending dosing intervals (59%), and deferring routine imaging (56%). Most clinicians anticipate continuing to use these interim funding measures in the coming months.

SEARCH METHODS: We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 Global Research Database, MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 Research Article Database and trial registries to identify completed and ongoing studies on 19 August 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA: We followed standard Cochrane methodology. We included studies evaluating convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin for people with COVID-19, irrespective of study design, disease severity, age, gender or ethnicity. We excluded studies including populations with other coronavirus diseases (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)) and studies evaluating standard immunoglobulin. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We followed standard Cochrane methodology. To assess bias in included studies, we used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' 2.0 tool for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), the Risk of Bias in Non-randomised Studies - of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool for controlled non-randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs), and the assessment criteria for observational studies, provided by Cochrane Childhood Cancer for non-controlled NRSIs. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for the following outcomes: all-cause mortality at hospital discharge, mortality (time to event), improvement of clinical symptoms (7, 15, and 30 days after transfusion), grade 3 and 4 adverse events (AEs), and serious adverse events (SAEs). MAIN RESULTS: This is the second living update of our review. We included 19 studies (2 RCTs, 8 controlled NRSIs, 9 non-controlled NRSIs) with 38,160 participants, of whom 36,081 received convalescent plasma. Two completed RCTs are awaiting assessment (published after 19 August 2020). We identified a further 138 ongoing studies evaluating convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin, of which 73 are randomised (3 reported in a study registry as already being completed, but without results). We did not identify any completed studies evaluating hyperimmune immunoglobulin. We did not include data from controlled NRSIs in data synthesis because of critical risk of bias. The overall certainty of evidence was low to very low, due to study limitations and results including both potential benefits and harms. Effectiveness of convalescent plasma for people with COVID-19 We included results from two RCTs (both stopped early) with 189 participants, of whom 95 received convalescent plasma. Control groups received standard care at time of treatment without convalescent plasma. We are uncertain whether convalescent plasma decreases all-cause mortality at hospital discharge (risk ratio (RR) 0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 1.34; 1 RCT, 86 participants; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether convalescent plasma decreases mortality (time to event) (hazard ratio (HR) 0.64, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.25; 2 RCTs, 189 participants; low-certainty evidence). Convalescent plasma may result in little to no difference in improvement of clinical symptoms (i.e. need for respiratory support) at seven days (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.30 to 3.19; 1 RCT, 103 participants; low-certainty evidence). Convalescent plasma may increase improvement of clinical symptoms at up to 15 days (RR 1.34, 95% CI 0.85 to 2.11; 2 RCTs, 189 participants; low-certainty evidence), and at up to 30 days (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.43; 2 studies, 188 participants; low-certainty evidence). No studies reported on quality of life. Safety of convalescent plasma for people with COVID-19 We included results from two RCTs, eight controlled NRSIs and nine non-controlled NRSIs assessing safety of convalescent plasma. Reporting of safety data and duration of follow-up was variable. The controlled studies reported on AEs and SAEs only in participants receiving convalescent plasma. Some, but not all, studies included death as a SAE. The studies did not report the grade of AEs. Fourteen studies (566 participants) reported on AEs of possible grade 3 or 4 severity. The majority of these AEs were allergic or respiratory events. We are very uncertain whether convalescent plasma therapy affects the risk of moderate to severe AEs (very low-certainty evidence). 17 studies (35,944 participants) assessed SAEs for 20,622 of its participants. The majority of participants were from one non-controlled NRSI (20,000 participants), which reported on SAEs within the first four hours and within an additional seven days after transfusion. There were 63 deaths, 12 were possibly and one was probably related to transfusion. There were 146 SAEs within four hours and 1136 SAEs within seven days post-transfusion. These were predominantly allergic or respiratory, thrombotic or thromboembolic and cardiac events. We are uncertain whether convalescent plasma therapy results in a clinically relevant increased risk of SAEs (low-certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We are uncertain whether convalescent plasma is beneficial for people admitted to hospital with COVID-19. There was limited information regarding grade 3 and 4 AEs to determine the effect of convalescent plasma therapy on clinically relevant SAEs. In the absence of a control group, we are unable to assess the relative safety of convalescent plasma therapy. While major efforts to conduct research on COVID-19 are being made, recruiting the anticipated number of participants into these studies is problematic. The early termination of the first two RCTs investigating convalescent plasma, and the lack of data from 20 studies that have completed or were due to complete at the time of this update illustrate these challenges. Well-designed studies should be prioritised. Moreover, studies should report outcomes in the same way, and should consider the importance of maintaining comparability in terms of co-interventions administered in all study arms. There are 138 ongoing studies evaluating convalescent plasma and hyperimmune immunoglobulin, of which 73 are RCTs (three already completed). This is the second living update of the review, and we will continue to update this review periodically. Future updates may show different results to those reported here.","Chai, Khai Li; Valk, Sarah J; Piechotta, Vanessa; Kimber, Catherine; Monsef, Ina; Doree, Carolyn; Wood, Erica M; Lamikanra, Abigail A; Roberts, David J; McQuilten, Zoe; So-Osman, Cynthia; Estcourt, Lise J; Skoetz, Nicole",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,,210

The genesis of this virus is still unknown. To elucidate its molecular evolution and regulation of gene expression, the knowledge of codon usage is a pre-requisite. In this study, an attempt was made to document the genome-wide codon usage profile and the various factors influencing the codon usage patterns of SARS-CoV-2 in human and dog. The SARS-CoV-2 genome showed relative abundance of A and U nucleotides and relative synonymous codon usage analysis revealed that the preferred synonymous codons mostly end with A/U. The analysis of ENc-GC3s, Neutrality and Parity rule 2 plots indicated that natural selection and other undefined factors dominate the overall codon usage bias in SARS-CoV-2 whereas the impact of mutation pressure is comparatively minor. The codon adaptation index and relative codon deoptimization index of SARS-CoV-2 deciphered that human is more favoured host for adaptation compared to dog. These results enhance our understanding of the factors involved in evolution of the novel human SARS-CoV-2 and its adaptability in dog.","Dutta, Rupam; Buragohain, Lukumoni; Borah, Probodh",Virus Res,,210

Several studies on families with children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) revealed that lockdown increased the difficulties faced by individuals with ASD, as well as parental distress. No studies have analyzed the interplay between parental distress, children’s emotional responses, and adaptive behaviors in children with ASD considering the period of the mandatory lockdown. Furthermore, we compared families with children on the spectrum and families with typically developing (TD) children in terms of their distress, children’s emotional responses, and behavioral adaptation. Methods: In this study, 120 parents of children aged 5–10 years (53 with ASD) participated. Results: In the four tested models, children’s positive and negative emotional responses mediated the impact of parental distress on children’s playing activities. In the ASD group, parents reported that their children expressed more positive emotions, but fewer playing activities, than TD children. Families with children on the spectrum reported greater behavioral problems during the lockdown and more parental distress. Conclusions: Our findings inform the interventions designed for parents to reduce distress and to develop coping strategies to better manage the caregiver–child relationship.","Levante, Annalisa Petrocchi Serena Bianco Federica Castelli Ilaria Colombi Costanza Keller Roberto Narzisi Antonio Masi Gabriele Lecciso Flavia",Brain Sciences,,210

As such, there has been significant research into all aspects of the disease, including diagnostic biomarkers, associated risk factors, and strategies that might be used for its treatment and prevention. Toward this end, eosinopenia has been identified as one of many factors that might facilitate the diagnosis and prognosis of severe COVID-19. However, this finding is neither definitive nor pathognomonic for COVID-19. While eosinophil-associated conditions have been misdiagnosed as COVID-19 and others are among its reported complications, patients with pre-existing eosinophil-associated disorders (e.g., asthma, eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders) do not appear to be at increased risk for severe disease; interestingly, several recent studies suggest that a diagnosis of asthma may be associated with some degree of protection. Finally, although vaccine-associated aberrant inflammatory responses, including eosinophil accumulation in the respiratory tract, were observed in preclinical immunization studies targeting the related SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV pathogens, no similar complications have been reported clinically in response to the widespread dissemination of either of the two encapsulated mRNA-based vaccines for COVID-19.","Rosenberg, Helene F; Foster, Paul S",Semin Immunopathol,,210

However, previously published survey data indicated that formal instruction on the correct utilization of PPE is uncommon in medical school curricula, and there is no published guidance about optimal instruction methods. The infectious disease (ID) simulation lab at Oregon Health & Science University filled this need. Methods: Second- through fourth-year medical students participated in the infection intersession, a 2-week didactic session that students were required to enroll in once during their clinical rotations. As part of the course, students completed the ID simulation lab, during which they were presented with common ID syndromes (suspected tuberculosis, C. difficile colitis, and neutropenic fever) and asked to select the proper PPE prior to interacting with standardized patients. ID physicians acted as the patients and then conducted feedback sessions, which focused on PPE choice, donning and doffing techniques, and ID diagnosis and management principles. Results: More than 500 medical students participated between 2016 and 2020, demonstrating the feasibility of the experience. The average exam scores were above 80%, and the average student evaluation score of the session was 8.9 out of 10, demonstrating acceptability. Discussion: The ID simulation lab allowed students to reinforce didactic teaching about PPE, dispel common misconceptions, and receive real-time feedback from ID clinicians. Availability of the lab and facilitators were limiting factors. Future work will focus on better understanding the efficacy of the sessions.","Villamagna, Angela Holly; Bonura, Erin M",MedEdPORTAL,,210
338195,Future for coronavirus disease 2019: India,2020,"Cognitive flexibility enables appropriate responses to a changing environment and is associated with positive life outcomes. Adolescence, with its increased focus on transitioning to independent living, presents particular challenges for youths with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) who often struggle to behave in a flexible way when faced with challenges. This review focuses on brain mechanisms underlying the development of flexible cognition during adolescence and how these neural systems are affected in ASD. Neuroimaging studies of task switching and set-shifting provide evidence for atypical lateral frontoparietal and midcingulo-insular network activation during cognitive flexibility task performance in individuals with ASD. Recent work also examines how intrinsic brain network dynamics support flexible cognition. These dynamic functional connectivity studies provide evidence for alterations in the number of transitions between brain states, as well as hypervariability of functional connections in adolescents with ASD. Future directions for the field include addressing issues related to measurement of cognitive flexibility using a combination of metrics with ecological and construct validity. Heterogeneity of executive function ability in ASD must also be parsed to determine which individuals will benefit most from targeted training to improve flexibility. The influence of pubertal hormones on brain network development and cognitive maturation in adolescents with ASD is another area requiring further exploration. Finally, the intriguing possibility that bilingualism might be associated with preserved cognitive flexibility in ASD should be further examined. Addressing these open questions will be critical for future translational neuroscience investigations of cognitive and behavioral flexibility in adolescents with ASD.","Uddin, Lucina Q",Biol. psychiatr,,210

COVID-19 infection, which was named by the International Committee of Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) as SARS-CoV-2, is a newly identified coronavirus. The last century has seen the outbreak of numerous life-threatening human pathogens including Nipah, Ebola, Zika, Chikungunya, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and more recently a novel coronavirus has been observed. COVID-19 infection has so far spread to more than 186 countries around the world and KRG/Iraq has not been free from this virus. In this survey, the control of COVID-19 infection in KRG as a part of Iraq is discussed in detail. The methods of identification as well as the drugs that are currently in common use to reduce the wide distribution of COVID-19 infection and their effects in countries around the world are considered. So far, 714 positive cases have been reported by the ministry of health in Kurdistan Region Government-Iraq (KRG), among which there have been only 8 deaths, and 420 cases have recovered. Those who died had a previous history of a chronic disease such as diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, and hypercholesteremia. Alternative medicine based on natural green methods has been widely used by Kurdish people in past years for treatment of strong coughs. In the present study, some natural products which are cost free and effective in enhancing the body's resistance against the virus are considered. A surprising finding is that the patients in KRG have not in general had a severe cough, flu, or fever. The possible explanation may relate to the patients' strong immune systems, since none of them had a history of using alcohol and drugs, or of chronic disease. The epidemiology and transmission of the virus are discussed as well.","Aziz, Peshawa Yunis; Hadi, Jihad M.; Sha, Aram M.; Aziz, Shujahadeen Bakr; Rahman, Heshu Sulaiman; Ahmed, Hiwa A.; Abdulla, Mahmood Ameen; Amine Ali, Shwan M.",Intl.

METHODS: A retrospective analysis of patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 at a referral centre in Madrid, Spain, during March-May 2020 was performed. Recorded variables (age, gender, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, outcome), and geographical area of origin were compared for Europeans and non-Europeans (Latin Americans, Asians and Africans). RESULTS: In total, 2345 patients with confirmed COVID-19 hospitalized during the study period were included in the study. Of these, 1956 (83.4%) were European and 389 (16.6%) were non-European (of whom over 90%, 354/389, were Latin American). Non-Europeans were significantly younger than Europeans (mean 54 (SD 13.5) versus 70.4 (SD 15.1) years, p < 0.001); the majority were male (1420/2345, 60.6%), with no significant differences in gender between Europeans and non-Europeans (1197/1956 (61.2%) male in the European group versus 223/389 (57.3%) male in the non-European group, p 0.15). In-hospital mortality overall was higher in Europeans (443/1956, 22.7%) than in non-Europeans (40/389, 10.3%) (p < 0.001), but there were no significant differences when adjusted for age/gender (OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.86-1.88). Non-Europeans were more frequently admitted to ICU (71/389, 18.3%) compared with Europeans (187/1956, 9.6%) (p < 0.001) and a difference in ICU admission rate was also found when adjusted for age/gender (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.03-1.98).

341301,Take precautions beforehand: calling for clinical trials of pediatric drugs for treating coronavirus disease 2019,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic emerges a reminder that wide spectrum discrepancy in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and antiviral drugs among different populations might be due to their different ACE2 SNPs and/or miRNAs profile. ACE2 is the major component for SARS-CoV-2s' cell entry, and disruption of its 3D structure could influence virus-ACE2 interaction. In this study we aimed to investigate the consequence of 16,860 SNPs within ACE2 on its expression as well as protein folding, function, and stability by using several beneficial bioinformatics tools. Only 64 SNPs including 60 intronic, and 4 missense showed different frequencies among different populations. Two missense SNPs including rs149039346 and rs147311723 have been predicted to strongly influence the function and stability of ACE2. rs1514283 creates new acceptor splice site. Also, rs4646175 creates new donor and acceptor splice site. PolymiRTS, and miRSNPs have predicted that rs3746444, rs113808830, and rs3751304 showed a MAFâ¯>â¯0.001, and disrupted mRNA target sites or mRNA function. Finally, rs3746444 hsa-miR-499a-3p, rs113808830 hsa-miR-4532, rs3751304 hsa-miR-6763-3p and hsa-miR-26b-5p were strongly hybridized with ACE2 and might influence its function. Collectively, this study shed some light on fundamental roles of ACE2 SNPs for its interaction with COVID-19, and consequently susceptibility to virus. Therefore, different responses of patients with COVID-19 to ACE2 blocker drugs might be due to their unique ACE2 SNPs. We further discussed the impact of SNPs on miRNAs profile as a factor that may modulate drug response or susceptibility to COVID-19.","Paniri, Alireza; Hosseini, Mohammad Mahdi; Eslam, Mojtaba Moballegh; Akhavan-Niaki, Haleh",Gene Rep,,210

The estimated frequency is around 10% and signs and symptoms may last for months. The main long-term manifestations observed in other coronaviruses (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)) are very similar to and have clear clinical parallels with SARS-CoV-2: mainly respiratory, musculoskeletal, and neuropsychiatric. The growing number of patients worldwide will have an impact on health systems. Therefore, the main objective of these clinical practice guidelines is to identify patients with signs and symptoms of long COVID-19 in primary care through a protocolized diagnostic process that studies possible etiologies and establishes an accurate differential diagnosis. The guidelines have been developed pragmatically by compiling the few studies published so far on long COVID-19, editorials and expert opinions, press releases, and the authors' clinical experience. Patients with long COVID-19 should be managed using structured primary care visits based on the time from diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Based on the current limited evidence, disease management of long COVID-19 signs and symptoms will require a holistic, longitudinal follow up in primary care, multidisciplinary rehabilitation services, and the empowerment of affected patient groups.","Sisó-Almirall, Antoni; Brito-Zerón, Pilar; Conangla Ferrín, Laura; Kostov, Belchin; Moragas Moreno, Anna; Mestres, Jordi; Sellarès, Jaume; Galindo, Gisela; Morera, Ramon; Basora, Josep; Trilla, Antoni; Ramos-Casals, Manuel",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,210

This study aimed to review evidence regarding the impact of COVID-19 on breastfeeding plans and how these relate to women's psychological outcomes. Searches were conducted on PubMed and Web of Science for studies in English, Spanish, and Portuguese between January 2020 and January 2021. All study designs and pre-prints were considered. Twelve studies were included. Reports suggest that COVID-19 impacts differently on breastfeeding plans, which in turn leads to distinctive mental health outcomes. Positive breastfeeding experiences have been observed when mothers perceive that they have more time for motherhood, which may be associated with better mental health outcomes. Negative breastfeeding experiences have been observed when mothers are separated from their newborns, when mothers struggle with breastfeeding, or when mothers perceive decreased family and professional support, which seems to be associated with worse mental health outcomes. These preliminary results highlight the need for further research into the association between COVID-19, breastfeeding expectations, and maternal mental health. Filling this gap will foster the development of guidelines and interventions to better support mothers experiencing the obstacles of COVID-19 pandemic.","Pacheco, Francisca; Sobral, Mónica; Guiomar, Raquel; de la Torre-Luque, Alejandro; Caparros-Gonzalez, Rafael A; Ganho-Ávila, Ana",,,210

348094,Olfactory disorders in coronavirus disease 2019 patients: a systematic literature review,2020,"The effect of weather on COVID-19 spread is poorly understood. Recently, few studies have claimed that warm weather can possibly slowdown the global pandemic, which has already affected over 1.6 million people worldwide. Clarification of such relationships in the worst affected country, the US, can be immensely beneficial to understand the role of weather in transmission of the disease in the highly populated countries, such as India. We collected the daily data of new cases in 50 US states between Jan 1-Apr 9, 2020 and also the corresponding weather information (i.e., temperature (T) and absolute humidity (AH)). Distribution modeling of new cases across AH and T, helped identify the narrow and vulnerable AH range. We validated the results for 10-day intervals against monthly observations, and also worldwide trends. The results were used to predict Indian regions which would be vulnerable to weather based spread in upcoming months of 2020. COVID-19 spread in the US is significant for states with 4 < AH < 6 g/m3 and number of new cases > 10,000, irrespective of the chosen time intervals for study parameters. These trends are consistent with worldwide observations, but do not correlate well with India so far possibly due the total cases reported per interval < 10,000. The results clarify the relationship between weather parameters and COVID-19 spread. The vulnerable weather parameters will help classify the risky geographic areas in different countries. Specifically, with further reporting of new cases in India, prediction of states with high risk of weather based spread will be apparent.","Gupta, Sonal; Raghuwanshi, Gourav Singh; Chanda, Arnab",Sci Total Environ,,210

Methods: A non-paired case-control study was conducted with 235 patients hospitalized at a reference hospital in northeastern Brazil between March and April 2020. The case group was composed of individuals who required hospitalization in the ICU. The control group was composed of patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 who did not meet the criteria established in the institutional protocol for classification as ""severe case of the disease"" and therefore did not require intensive care. Results: The case group was composed of 84 patients with a median age of 45 years (P25-P75: 36-59);63.1% were men;56.0% were less than 60 years of age;76.2% had excess weight;14.3% had a previous heart disease;46.4% had hypertension;11.9% had lung disease;and 67.1% took continuous-use medications. The median stay of severe cases in the ICU was positively correlated with weight and BMI only among female patients less than 60 years of age. Conclusion: The logistic regression analysis revealed that age older than 60 years and a compromised cardiovascular system were independent predictive factors for the severity of COVID-19.","Da Silva, P.

Community clusters with &gt;= 5 cases were characterized by size and duration and then categorized using K-means clustering, and the correlation between the types of clusters and the level of social distancing was investigated. RESULTS: A total of 134 clusters including 4,033 cases were identified. The clusters were categorized into small (Type I, II), medium (type III), and large (type IV) clusters. With the same number of daily confirmed cases, cases were composed of different types of clusters by different periods of time. Raising social distancing was related with shifting types of clusters from large to small sized clusters. CONCLUSIONS: Classification of clusters may provide opportunities to better portray the pattern of COVID-19 outbreaks and implement more effective strategies. Social distancing administered by the government may be effective in suppressing large clusters but may not be effective in controlling small and sporadic clusters.","Choi, Y. J.; Park, M.

354805,Incidence and Outcomes of Acute Kidney Injury in Critically Ill Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019,2021,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had a significant impact on dentistry in the UK due to the perceived risks associated with infection control. These concerns have led to a complete paralysis of routine dental care with provisions for emergency dental care only, which have been scarce. Considering the latter, this article presents a service evaluation of a hospital-based acute dental care service, which was rapidly adapted and enhanced to continue managing dental emergencies during the COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis is based upon the dental diagnoses, management and geography of travel of over 1,500 attending patients in a five-week period during the rise and peak of COVID-19 in the UK. In addition, we assess our dental workforce's COVID-19 sickness reporting for those providing urgent dental care within this enhanced service. The article aims to provide additional and valuable frontline clinical information, experience and outcomes, including our categorisation of personal protective equipment used for varying face-to-face dental management during COVID-19.","Grossman, Sanford; Sandhu, Pradeep; Sproat, Christopher; Patel, Vinod",Br Dent J,,210
354865,Nationwide survey of the coronavirus disease 2019 prevention and treatment systems for kidney disease patients: a study of Japanese Society of Nephrology-certified educational facilities,2021,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging serious global health problem. Gastrointestinal symptoms are common in COVID-19 patients, and SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in stool specimens. However, the relationship between the gut microbiome and disease remains to be established. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 30 COVID-19 patients, 24 influenza A (H1N1) patients, and 30 matched healthy controls (HC) to identify differences in the gut microbiota by 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene V3-V4 region sequencing. RESULTS: Compared with HC, COVID-19 patients had significantly reduced bacterial diversity, a significantly higher relative abundance of opportunistic pathogens, such as Streptococcus, Rothia, Veillonella and Actinomyces, and a lower relative abundance of beneficial symbionts. Five biomarkers showed high accuracy for distinguishing COVID-19 patients from HC with an area under the curve (AUC) up to 0.89. Patients with H1N1 displayed lower diversity and different overall microbial composition compared with COVID-19 patients. Seven biomarkers were selected to distinguish the two cohorts with an AUC of 0.94. CONCLUSION: The gut microbial signature of patients with COVID-19 was different from that of H1N1 patients and HC. Our study suggests the potential value of the gut microbiota as a diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for COVID-19, but further validation is needed.","Gu, Silan; Chen, Yanfei; Wu, Zhengjie; Chen, Yunbo; Gao, Hainv; Lv, Longxian; Guo, Feifei; Zhang, Xuewu; Luo, Rui; Huang, Chenjie; Lu, Haifeng; Zheng, Beiwen; Zhang, Jiaying; Yan, Ren; Zhang, Hua; Jiang, Huiyong; Xu, Qiaomai; Guo, Jing; Gong, Yiwen; Tang, Lingling; Li, Lanjuan",Clin. infect. dis,,210

356492,"Clinical features, laboratory findings and persistence of virus in 10 children with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)",2020,"BACKGROUND: The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has led to the development of serological assays that could aid in an understanding of the burden of COVID-19 disease. Many available tests lack rigorous evaluation and therefore results may be misleading. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the performance of a novel multiplexed immunoassay for the simultaneous detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike (S), spike receptor binding domain (RBD), spike N terminal domain and nucleocapsid antigen and a novel pseudo-neutralisation assay. METHODS: A multiplexed solid-phase chemiluminescence assay (Meso Scale Discovery) was evaluated for the simultaneous detection of IgG binding to four SARS-CoV-2 antigens and the quantification of antibody-induced ACE-2 binding inhibition (pseudo-neutralisation assay). Sensitivity was evaluated with a total of 196 COVID-19 serum samples (169 confirmed PCR positive and 27 anti-nucleocapsid IgG positive) from individuals with mild symptomatic or asymptomatic disease. Specificity was evaluated with 194 control serum samples collected from adults prior to December 2019. RESULTS: The specificity and sensitivity of the binding IgG assay was highest for S protein with a specificity of 97.4 % and sensitivity of 96.2 % for samples taken 14 days and 97.9 % for samples taken 21 days following the onset of symptoms. IgG concentration to S and RBD correlated strongly with percentage inhibition measured by the pseudo-neutralisation assay. CONCLUSION: Excellent sensitivity for IgG detection was obtained over 14 days since onset of symptoms for three SARS-CoV-2 antigens (S, RBD and N) in this multiplexed assay which can also measure antibody functionality.","Johnson, Marina; Wagstaffe, Helen R; Gilmour, Kimberly C; Mai, Annabelle Lea; Lewis, Joanna; Hunt, Adam; Sirr, Jake; Bengt, Christopher; Grandjean, Louis; Goldblatt, David",J Clin Virol,,210

Furthermore, possible applications of this compound were evaluated as antibacterial, antiadhesive, and antifungal. At a concentration of 50 %, the biosurfactant was found to inhibit the growth of Bacillus cereus, showing high inhibitions levels against Salmonella Enteritidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. The antifungal activity was evaluated against Aspergillus, Cercospora, Colletotrichum, and Fusarium, obtaining results of up to 95 % inhibition. In addition to these promising results, the yeast W. anomalus produced the biosurfactant from an inexpensive substrate, which increases the possibility of its application in several industries owing to the low cost involved.","de Andrade Teixeira Fernandes, Natalia; de Souza, Angélica Cristina; Simões, Luara Aparecida; Ferreira Dos Reis, Gustavo Magno; Souza, Karla Teixeira; Schwan, Rosane Freitas; Dias, Disney Ribeiro",Microbiol Res,,210

The impact of the pandemic is inevitably not limited to patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and their outcomes; however, the impact of COVID-19 on intensive care has not yet been analyzed. METHODS: The objective of this propensity score-matched study was to compare the clinical outcomes of non-COVID-19 critically ill patients with the outcomes of prepandemic patients. Critically ill, non-COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) during the first wave of the pandemic were matched with patients admitted in the previous year. Mortality, length of stay, and rate of readmission were compared between the two groups after matching. RESULTS: A total of 211 critically ill SARS-CoV­2 negative patients admitted between 13 March 2020 and 16 May 2020 were matched to 211 controls, selected from a matching pool of 1421 eligible patients admitted to the ICU in 2019. After matching, the outcomes were not significantly different between the two groups: ICU mortality was 5.2% in 2019 and 8.5% in 2020, pâ¯= 0.248, while intrahospital mortality was 10.9% in 2019 and 14.2% in 2020, pâ¯= 0.378.

These people may be at serious risk of covid-19. Information about the effects of Covid-19 on people living with HIV, is limited. CASE PRESENTATION: We reported a 61-year-old man who was a known case of HIV from 6 years ago that was being treated with HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy). He also had a history of Hodgkin's lymphoma from 4 years ago who underwent autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT) 2 weeks before given referral to our hospital. He complained of weakness, anorexia, and fever. RT-PCR for SARS-COV-2-RNA was positive in his nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab. He was diagnosed with COVID-19 infection and treated with atazanavir. After one week, the patient discharged in a good general state. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, it is the first report of COVID-19 infection in an HIV positive patient after BMT in Iran. Despite his immunodeficiency, COVID-19 disease had mild manifestations and he had a good prognosis. We hope that our report and that of others can remain promising to doctors and HIV patients cross fingers for COVID-19 recovery.","Mardani, Masoud; Sharifi-Razavi, Athena; Sheibani, Shirin; Baziboroun, Mana",Current HIV research (Online),,210

PED causes damage to the intestine, including villus atrophy and shedding, leading to serious economic losses to the pig industry worldwide. We carried out an in vitro study to investigate cell apoptosis and the cell cycle in a PEDV-infected host using transcriptomic shotgun sequencing (RNA-Seq) to study gene responses to PEDV infection. Results revealed that the PEDV infection reduced proliferation activity, blocked the cell cycle at S-phase and induced apoptosis in IPEC-J2 cells. The expression of gene levels related to ribosome proteins and oxidative phosphorylation were significantly up-regulated post-PEDV infection. Although the significantly down-regulated on PI3K/Akt signaling pathway post-PEDV infection, the regulator-related genes of mTOR signaling pathway exerted significantly up-regulated or down-regulated in IPEC-J2 cells. These results indicated that ribosome proteins and oxidative phosphorylation process were widely involved in the pathological changes and regulation of host cells caused by PEDV infection, and PI3K/AKT and mTOR signaling pathways played a vital role in antiviral regulation in IPEC-J2 cells. These data might provide new insights into the specific pathogenesis of PEDV infection and pave the way for the development of effective therapeutic strategies.","Shen, Xuehuai; Yin, Lei; Pan, Xiaocheng; Zhao, Ruihong; Zhang, Danjun",Microb Pathog,,210

365743,The diagnosis of pneumonia in a pregnant woman with coronavirus disease 2019 using maternal lung ultrasound,2020,"PURPOSE: This study investigated changes in retinal vessel density in macular and papillary regions in post-SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia patients by means of optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA). DESIGN: Prospective, observational, cohort study. METHODS: Forty eyes of 40 patients (mean age: 49.7 ± 12.6 years old) post-SARS-CoV-2 infection and 40 healthy subjects were enrolled in this study. COVID-19 patients had to be fully recovered from COVID-19 pneumonia and were evaluated 6 months after COVID-19 infection. The primary outcome resulted from OCTA studies of the following vascular structures: vessel density (VD) in the retinal superficial capillary plexus (SCP), deep capillary plexus (DCP), and radial peripapillary capillaries (RPC) compared to those of controls. Structural spectral domain (SD)-OCT parameters were also evaluated: ganglion cell complex (GCC) and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL). RESULTS: The patients showed a significant reduction in VD of the SCP in whole images and in the DCP in all sectors compared to those in healthy subjects (P <.05). COVID-19 patients featured a reduced VD of the RPC compared to that in controls (P <.001). No differences were found in the GCC, whereas the RNFL was reduced in the COVID-19 group compared to that in controls (P = .012). Significant correlations were found between the RNFL and VD of the SCP, DCP, RPC, and FAZ area in the COVID-19 group (P <.05). CONCLUSIONS: OCTA showed retinal vascular changes in subjects fully recovered from COVID-19 pneumonia. These findings could be a consequence of a thrombotic microangiopathy that affected retinal structures as well as other systemic organs. OCTA could represent a valid, noninvasive biomarker of early vascular dysfunction after SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Cennamo, Gilda; Reibaldi, Michele; Montorio, Daniela; D039,; Andrea, Luca; Fallico, Matteo; Triassi, Maria",Am J Ophthalmol,,210
365744,The diagnosis of pneumonia in a pregnant woman with coronavirus disease 2019 using maternal lung ultrasound,2020,"We propose an on-chip mid-infrared (MIR) photonic spectroscopy platform for aerosol characterization to obtain highly discriminatory information on the chemistry of aerosol particles. Sensing of aerosols is crucial for various environmental, climactic, warfare threat detection, and pulmonary healthcare applications. Further, there are a number of unintended situations for potential exposure to bioaerosols such as viruses, bacteria, and fungi. For instance, the current pandemic scenario of COVID-19 occurring across the world. Currently, chemical characterization of aerosols is performed using FTIR spectroscopy yielding chemical fingerprinting because most of the vibrational and rotational transitions of chemical molecules fall in the MIR range; and Raman spectroscopy. Both techniques use free space bench-top geometries. Here, we propose miniaturized on-chip MIR photonics-based aerosol spectroscopy consisting of a broadband spiral-waveguide sensor that significantly enhances particle-light interaction to improve sensitivity. The spiral waveguides are made of a chalcogenide glass material (Ge23Sb7S70) which shows a broad transparency over IR range. We demonstrate the sensing of N-methyl aniline-based aerosol particles with the device. We anticipate that the sensor will readily complement existing photonic resonator-based particle sizing and counting techniques to develop a unified framework for on-chip integrated photonic aerosol spectroscopy.","Singh, Robin; Su, Peter; Kimerling, Lionel; Agarwal, Anu; Anthony, Brian W",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06910v2.pdf,210
365935,Interferon-α-2b aerosol inhalation is associated with improved clinical outcomes in patients with coronavirus disease-2019,2021,"BACKGROUND: Markedly elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and defective type-I interferon responses were reported in COVID-19 patients. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine whether particular cytokine profiles are associated with COVID-19 severity and mortality. METHODS: Cytokine concentrations and SARS-CoV-2 antigen were measured at hospital admission in serum of symptomatic COVID-19 patients (N=115), classified at hospitalization into three respiratory severity groups: no need for mechanical ventilatory support (No-MVS), intermediate severity requiring mechanical ventilatory support (MVS) and critical severity requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Principal component analysis was used to characterize cytokine profiles associated with severity and mortality. The results were thereafter confirmed in an independent validation cohort (N=86). RESULTS: At time of hospitalization, ECMO patients presented a dominant pro-inflammatory response with elevated levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&#945;), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 and IL-10. In contrast, an elevated type-I interferon response involving IFN-&#945; and IFN-ß was characteristic of No-MVS patients, whereas MVS patients exhibited both profiles. Mortality at one month was associated with higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in ECMO patients, higher levels of type-I interferons in No-MVS patients and their combination in MVS patients, resulting in a combined mortality prediction accuracy of 88.5% (Risk Ratio 24.3, p<0.0001). SARS-CoV-2 antigen levels correlated with type-I interferon levels and were associated with mortality, but not with pro-inflammatory response or severity. CONCLUSION: Distinct cytokine profiles are observed in association with COVID-19 severity and are differentially predictive of mortality according to oxygen support modalities. These results warrant personalized treatment of COVID-19 patients based on cytokine profiling.","Dorgham, Karim; Quentric, Paul; Gökkaya, Mehmet; Marot, Stéphane; Parizot, Christophe; Sauce, Delphine; Guihot, Amélie; Luyt, Charles-Edouard; Schmidt, Matthieu; Mayaux, Julien; Beurton, Alexandra; Le Guennec, Loic; Demeret, Sophie; Ben Salah, Elyes; Mathian, Alexis; Yssel, Hans; Combadiere, Béhazine; Combadiere, Christophe; Traidl-Hoffmann, Claudia; Burrel, Sonia; Marcelin, Anne-Geneviève; Amoura, Zahir; Voiriot, Guillaume; Neumann, Avidan U; Gorochov, Guy",J. allergy clin. immunol,,210

366516,"A ""Window of Therapeutic Opportunity"" for Anti-Cytokine Therapy in Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019",2020,"BACKGROUND: Deaths by COVID-19 have left behind nearly 12 million recent bereaved individuals worldwide and researchers have raised concerns that the circumstances of COVID-19 related deaths will lead to a rise prevalence of prolonged grief disorder (PGD) cases. However, to date, no studies have examined the prevalence of PGD among people bereaved due to COVID-19. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of PGD and investigated demographic and loss-related factors associated with prolonged grief symptoms among Chinese individuals bereaved due to COVID-19. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional online survey conducted between September 1 and October 3, 2020. A total of 422 Chinese participants (55.5% males; 32.73 [9.31] years old) who lost a close person due to COVID-19 participated in the study. Demographic and loss-related information was collected, and self-reported prolonged grief symptoms were measured by a 13-item International Prolonged Grief Disorder Scale (IPGDS: 1-65) and a 17-item Traumatic Grief Inventory Self Report (TGI-SR: 1-85). Multiple linear regression analysis was used to determine the associated factors of levels of grief symptoms. RESULTS: Prevalence of PGD was 37.8% screened by IPGDS and 29.3% by TGI-SR. No difference was found in levels of grief symptoms between participants whose close one died more than 6 months ago and those who experienced the loss less than 6 months ago. More severe prolonged grief symptoms assessed by IPGDS was associated with losing a close person by COVID-19 rather than complications (B: 5.35; 95% CI: 0.54-10.05), losing a partner (B: 7.80; 95% CI: 3.24-12.37), child (B: 8.15; 95% CI: 1.03-15.26), and parent (B: 5.49; 95% CI: 1.49-9.48) rather than losing a relative or a person with other relationship, feeling more traumatic about the loss (B: 1.71; 95% CI: 0.52-2.90), being closer with the deceased (B: 1.60; 95% CI: 0.34-2.86). Moreover, Losing a grandparent (B: 6.62; 95% CI: 0.53-12.71) and having more conflicts with the deceased (B: 1.05; 95% CI: - 0.008-2.11) were related to higher levels of grief symptoms assessed by TGI-SR. CONCLUSIONS: Echoing researchers' concerns, the prevalence of PGD is high among people bereaved due to COVID-19. Individuals with a higher risk of developing PGD should be identified and bereavement support should be offered as early as possible.","Tang, Suqin; Xiang, Zhendong",Global Health,,210

The entire economic activity all over the globe was disrupted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To revive the economy out of recession, various monetary and fiscal stimulus measures were announced by the Government of India. The objective of this research was to assess the perception of various stakeholders with respect to the effects of these stimulus measures on reviving Indian economy. Based on the intensive discussion with academic experts and policymakers from corporates, five constructs of monetary and fiscal stimulus measures were developed. Web-based survey was conducted with 250 stakeholders from India. Confirmatory factor analysis technique was applied to confirm the constructs. The path analysis using structural equation modelling revealed that all five hypotheses, that is, monetary policy, labour and land law, taxation and subsidies, general business climates, and employee and consumer-related monetary and fiscal stimulus measures, positively and insignificantly affected economic recovery. This results showed a positive perception of stakeholders about the stimulus measures on reviving the Indian economy. However, the insignificant results suggested that unless these stimulus measures are implemented and monitored properly by the Government of India, they would not revive the Indian economy in near future.","Prusty, Sadananda Anubha Gupta Saurabh",FIIB Business Review,,210

However, CT morphology can change significantly over the course of the disease. To evaluate the CT morphology of RT-PCR-proven COVID-19 pneumonia in a German cohort with special emphasis on identification of potential differences of CT features depending on duration and severity of disease. METHOD: All patients with RT-PCR-proven COVID-19 pneumonia and chest CT performed between March 1 and April 15, 2020 were retrospectively identified. The CT scans were evaluated regarding the presence of different CT features (e.âg. ground glass opacity, consolidation, crazy paving, vessel enlargement, shape, and margin of opacifications), distribution of lesions in the lung and extent of parenchymal involvement. For subgroup analyses the patients were divided according to the percentage of parenchymal opacification (0-33â%, 34-66â%, 67-100â%) and according to time interval between symptom onset and CT date (0-5âd, 6-10âd, 11-15âd, >â15âd). Differences in CT features and distribution between subgroups were tested using the Mantel-Haenszel Chi Squared for trend. RESULTS: The frequency of CT features (ground glass opacity, consolidation, crazy paving, bronchial dilatation, vessel enlargement, lymphadenopathy, pleural effusion) as well as pattern of parenchymal involvement differed significantly depending on the duration of disease and extent of parenchymal involvement. The early phase of disease was characterized by GGO and to a lesser extent consolidation. The opacifications tended to be round and to some extent with sharp margins and a geographic configuration. The vessels within/around the opacifications were frequently dilated. Later on, the frequency of consolidation and especially crazy paving increased, and the round/geographic shape faded. After day 15, bronchial dilatation occurred, and lymphadenopathy and pleural effusion were seen more frequently than before. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of CT features varied considerably during the course of disease and depending on the severity of parenchymal involvement. Radiologists should take into account the time interval between symptom onset and date of CT and the severity of disease when discussing the likelihood of COVID-19 pneumonia based on CT morphology. KEY POINTS: · The frequency of CT features and pattern of parenchymal involvement vary depending on the duration and extent of COVID-19 pneumonia.. · The early phase is characterized by GGO and consolidation which demonstrate a round shape and at least to some extent have sharp margins and a geographic configuration.. · The frequency of consolidation and especially crazy paving increases during the course of disease.. · Beyond day 15 after symptom onset, bronchial dilatation occurs.. · Radiologists should take into account the duration and severity of disease when considering COVID-19 pneumonia..

The extreme actions aimed to reduce virus diffusion have profoundly changed the lifestyles of the Italian population. Moreover, fear of contracting the infection has generated high levels of anxiety. This study aimed to understand the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on sleep quality, general anxiety symptomatology, and psychological distress. Methods: An online survey collected information on socio-demographic data and additional information concerning the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, sleep quality, sleep disorders, generalized anxiety symptoms, psychological distress, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomatology related to COVID-19 were assessed. Results: This study included 2291 respondents. The results revealed that 57.1% of participants reported poor sleep quality, 32.1% high anxiety, 41.8% high distress, and 7.6% reported PTSD symptomatology linked to COVID-19. Youth and women, those uncertain regarding possible COVID-19 infection, and greater fear of direct contact with those infected by COVID-19 had an increased risk of developing sleep disturbances, as well as higher levels of anxiety and distress. Finally, a significant relationship between sleep quality, generalized anxiety, and psychological distress with PTSD symptoms related to COVID-19 was evidenced. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic appears to be a risk factor for sleep disorders and psychological diseases in the Italian population, as previously reported in China. These results should be used as a starting point for further studies aimed to develop psychological interventions to minimize the brief and long-term consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Casagrande, Maria; Favieri, Francesca; Tambelli, Renata; Forte, Giuseppe",Sleep Med,,210

It is continually taking an enormous toll on mankind by means of increasing number of deaths, associated comorbidities, and socioeconomic loss around the globe. Unavailability of chemotherapeutics/vaccine has posed tremendous challenges to scientists and doctors for developing an urgent therapeutic strategy. In this connection, the present in silico study aims to understand the sequence divergence of spike protein (the major infective protein of SARS-CoV-2), its mode of interaction with the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptor (ACE2) receptor of human and related animal hosts/reservoir. Moreover, the involvement of the human Toll-like receptors (TLRs) against the spike protein has also been demonstrated. Our data indicated that the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 is phylogenetically close to bat coronavirus and strongly binds with ACE2 receptor protein from both human and bat origin. We have also found that cell surface TLRs, especially TLR4 is most likely to be involved in recognizing molecular patterns from SARS-CoV-2 to induce inflammatory responses. The present study supported the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 from a bat and also revealed that TLR4 may have a crucial role in the virus-induced inflammatory consequences associated with COVID-19. Therefore, selective targeting of TLR4-spike protein interaction by designing competitive TLR4-antagonists could pave a new way to treat COVID-19. Finally, this study is expected to improve our understanding on the immunobiology of SARS-CoV-2 and could be useful in adopting spike protein, ACE2, or TLR-guided intervention strategy against COVID-19 shortly.","Choudhury, Abhigyan; Mukherjee, Suprabhat",J. med. virol,,210

375673,Biochemical indicators of coronavirus disease 2019 exacerbation and the clinical implications,2020,"BACKGROUND: While SARS-CoV-2 similarly infects men and women, COVID-19 outcome is less favorable in men. Variability in COVID-19 severity may be explained by differences in the host genome. METHODS: We compared poly-amino acids variability from WES data in severely affected COVID-19 patients versus SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive oligo-asymptomatic subjects. FINDINGS: Shorter polyQ alleles (&#8804;22) in the androgen receptor (AR) conferred protection against severe outcome in COVID-19 in the first tested cohort (both males and females) of 638 Italian subjects. The association between long polyQ alleles (&#8805;23) and severe clinical outcome (p = 0.024) was also validated in an independent cohort of Spanish men <60 years of age (p = 0.014). Testosterone was higher in subjects with AR long-polyQ, possibly indicating receptor resistance (p = 0.042 Mann-Whitney U test). Inappropriately low serum testosterone level among carriers of the long-polyQ alleles (p = 0.0004 Mann-Whitney U test) predicted the need for intensive care in COVID-19 infected men. In agreement with the known anti-inflammatory action of testosterone, patients with long-polyQ and age &#8805;60 years had increased levels of CRP (p = 0.018, not accounting for multiple testing). INTERPRETATION: We identify the first genetic polymorphism that appears to predispose some men to develop more severe disease. Failure of the endocrine feedback to overcome AR signaling defects by increasing testosterone levels during the infection leads to the polyQ tract becoming dominant to serum testosterone levels for the clinical outcome. These results may contribute to designing reliable clinical and public health measures and provide a rationale to test testosterone as adjuvant therapy in men with COVID-19 expressing long AR polyQ repeats.

Without imported cases, if a region is willing to implement measures to prevent spread at one level in number of cases, it must also be willing to prevent the spread with at a lower level, since it will be cheaper to do so and has only positive other effects. With imported cases, if a region is not coordinating with other regions, we show the cheapest policy is continually low but nonzero cases due to decreasing cost of halting imported cases. When it is coordinating, zero is cost-optimal. Our analysis indicates that within Europe cooperation targeting a reduction of both within country transmission, and between country importation risk, should help achieve lower transmission and reduced costs.","Janssen, Jacob; Bar-Yam, Yaneer",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.04758v1.pdf,210

The aim of this study was to examine the effects of HCQ and other immunosuppressive drugs on the incidence of COVID-19. Methods: The data were collected from the South Korea National Health Insurance Sharing-COVID-19 database. All individuals who underwent nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab tests for COVID-19 from January 2020 to May 2020 are included. The association between COVID-19 risk and HCQ use was examined in a propensity score-matched population. Factors associated with COVID-19 were identified using multiple logistic regression analysis. Results: Total 8,070 patients with COVID-19 and 121,050 negative controls were included from the database. Among all participants, 381 were HCQ users. In a propensity score-matched population, the incidence of COVID-19 was 7.1% in HCQ users and 6.8% in non-users. The odds ratio (OR) for HCQ use was 1.05 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.58 to 1.89. Among the subpopulation of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 33 were diagnosed with COVID-19 and 478 were not. Use of HCQ, glucocorticoids, or other immunosuppressive drugs was not associated with COVID-19 risk, whereas abatacept use was. Chronic lung disease was an independent risk factor for COVID-19 diagnosis in patients with RA (adjusted OR, 6.07; 95% CI, 1.10 to 33.59). Conclusions: The risk of COVID-19 did not differ between HCQ users and non-users. Glucocorticoids, conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), and biological DMARDs other than abatacept did not increase the risk of COVID-19.","Kim, Ji-Won; Kwak, Sang Gyu; Lee, Hwajeong; Kim, Seong-Kyu; Choe, Jung-Yoon; Park, Sung-Hoon",Korean j. intern. med.,,210

Due to their complexity, a framework to experiment with different variations of trackers and their subcomponents is desired. This drove the authors research and experimentation with object tracking using MathWorks toolsets. In this paper, three object trackers - Point Target Tracker (PTT), Gamma Gaussian Inverse Wishart Probability Hypothesis Density (GGIW-PHD), and Gaussian Mixture Probability Hypothesis Density (GM-PHD) - are compared in simulation for track statistics and object/track accuracy. The results show that a rectangular GM-PHD multi object tracker outperforms the other trackers. A follow up is shown using real-world data and the process used to get the sensor data into the appropriate MathWorks format. The impact of COVID-19 prevented the collection of ground truth data so the real-world data cannot be compared using the same metrics. For this reason, the simulation portion of this paper will act as the detailed discussion of fusion and tracking while the real-world testing portion is an overview of the authors' process of converting real-world sensor data into a format compatible with MathWorks object tracking tools. © 2021 SAE International.

However, such measures may increase the risk of loneliness. The current study aimed to investigate (1) whether social distancing measures, particularly limiting close social interactions, are associated with loneliness among older adults, and (2) whether the association between social distancing measures and loneliness is moderated by sociodemographic characteristics. METHODS: Data were from the fourth wave (April 29 to May 26, 2020) of the nationally representative Understanding America Study COVID-19 Survey. We used data on adults 50 years or older (N = 3,253). Logistic regression models of loneliness were performed. Five indicators of social distancing measures were considered: (a) avoiding public spaces, gatherings, or crowds, (b) canceling or postponing social activities, (c) social visits, (d) no close contact (within 6 feet) with people living together, and (e) with people not living together. RESULTS: Cancelling or postponing social activities and avoiding close contact with people living together were associated with 33% (OR=1.33, CI=1.06-1.68, p < .05) and 47% (OR=1.47, CI=1.09-1.99, p < .05) greater odds of loneliness, respectively. Furthermore, limiting close contact with co-residents increased the probability of loneliness more for males, non-Hispanic Whites, those with higher levels of education and income. DISCUSSION: Efforts should be made to help older adults maintain social connectedness with close others by virtual communication methods. Our findings also call special attention to vulnerable groups at elevated risks of loneliness, emphasizing the need for tailored interventions.","Choi, Eun Young; Farina, Mateo P; Wu, Qiao; Ailshire, Jennifer",,,210

However, investments in, and the success of, sport volunteering is contingent on amiable socio-cultural, political, and economic conditions. In Europe, the context of this paper, the vibrancy of sport volunteering remains a concern since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Notwithstanding the pandemic, some transnational sport networks and regional governmental partnerships have been making more dedicated investments to fortify volunteer cultures in the region. In addition, collaborative ventures are finding ways to connect sport volunteering with wider international issues to support its growth across all sectors. Here, sustainability and environmental change have provided a key issue platform for sport volunteer leverage. As the pandemic continues to confront the existence and practices of sport organisations, and specifically their ability to engage volunteers, these issues have become salient. We present a commentary of the Erasmus + Sport-funded, pan-European, sport volunteering and sustainability focused, PlayGreen consortia and its organisation members responses to the unfolding pandemic across Europe. Our commentary is guided by spatial theory and internal administration insights. The pandemic has brought new ideas and cohesion into sport volunteer communities, challenged, and changed modes of production, and led to new forms of social transformation and action vis-à-vis environmental and sustainability issues. As sport organisations continue to find viable ways of existing, the experiences within the PlayGreen consortia evidence creative potential for future volunteer engagements. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Koutrou, N.; Kohe, G.

In addition to PCR diagnosis, periodic seroepidemiologic surveillance is important to analyze the epidemic situation. In this study, we analyzed the rate of seropositivity for the SARS-CoV-2 N and S antigens in Hyogo prefecture, Japan in August 2021. Sera collected from people who received a health check-up in a clinic of the Hyogo Prefecture Health Promotion Association were subjected to analysis of reactivity to the SARS-CoV-2 N and S antigens by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. For a total 1,000 sera, the positive rates to N and S antigens were 2.1% and 38.7%, respectively. The infectious rate estimated by serological analysis based on the presence of the anti-N antibody was 2.5-fold higher than the value reported based on PCR-based analysis, and it increased five-fold compared to the rate determined by our previous seroepidemiologic study in October, 2020. The anti-S positive rate was almost consistent with the vaccination rate in this area. The observed high anti-S antibody level in the seropositive population may indicate that the mass vaccination in Japan is being performed smoothly at this time point, although the infectious rate has also increased.","Ren, Zhenxiao; Furukawa, Koichi; Nishimura, Mitsuhiro; Kurahashi, Yukiya; Sutandhio, Silvia; Tjan, Lidya Handayani; Aoki, Kaito; Hasegawa, Natsumi; Arii, Jun; Uto, Kenichi; Matsui, Keiji; Sato, Itsuko; Saegusa, Jun; Godai, Nonoka; Takeshita, Kohei; Yamamoto, Masaki; Nagashima, Tatsuya; Mori, Yasuko",,,210

However, the factors are not yet determined. METHOD: We retrospectively analyzed 123 previously healthy young adults diagnosed with COVID-19 from January to March 2020 in a tertiary hospital in Wuhan. Patients were classified as having mild or severe COVID-19 based on their respiratory rate, SpO2, and PaO2/FiO2 levels. Patients' symptoms, computer tomography (CT) images, preadmission drugs received, and the serum biochemical examination on admission were compared between the mild and severe groups. Significant variables were enrolled into logistic regression model to predict the factors affecting disease severity. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was applied to validate the predictive value of predictors. RESULT: Age; temperature; anorexia; and white blood cell count, neutrophil percentage, platelet count, lymphocyte count, C-reactive protein, aspartate transaminase, creatine kinase, albumin, and fibrinogen values were significantly different between patients with mild and severe COVID-19 (P < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis confirmed that lymphopenia (P = 0.010) indicated severe prognosis in previously healthy young adults with COVID-19, with the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.791(95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.704-0.877)(P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: For previously healthy young adults with COVID-19, lymphopenia on admission can predict severe prognosis.","Zhou, Changzhi; Huang, Zhe; Tan, Weijun; Li, Xueying; Yin, Wen; Xiao, Yang; Tao, Zhaowu; Geng, Shuang; Hu, Yi",Respir Res,,210

Current responses are aligned to treatment-based solutions, instead of determining the roles of its inter-related causes. This project aims to assess and understand the complex interplay of eco-bio-social-political factors that determine infantile anaemia to inform policy, research design and prevention practices. METHODS: This is a longitudinal birth cohort study including four components: (1) biological, will assess known blood markers of iron homeostasis and anaemia and stool microbiota to identify and genetically analyse the participants' flora; (2) ecological, will assess and map pollutants in air, water and soil and evaluate features of nutrition and perceived food security; (3) social, which will use different qualitative research methodologies to explore key stakeholders and informants' perceptions related to nutritional, environmental and anaemia topics, participant observations and a participatory approach and (4) a political analysis, to identify and assess the impact of policies, guidelines and programmes at all levels for infantile anaemia in the three regions. Finally, we will also explore the role of social determinants and demographic variables longitudinally for all study participants. This project aims to contribute to the evidence of the inter-related causal factors of infantile anaemia, addressing the complexity of influencing factors from diverse methodological angles.

392910,"Epidemiological analysis of the early 38 fatalities in Hubei, China, of the coronavirus disease 2019",2020,"INTRODUCTION: Ocular symptoms are uncommon manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Earlier study reported that dry eye, blurred vision, foreign body sensation, tearing, itching, conjunctival secretion, conjunctival congestion, ocular pain, and photophobia are among the ocular symptoms that could be found in COVID-19 patients. However, there are only a few reports available regarding corneal involvement in this disease. Here we report a case of keratoconjunctivitis as the only symptom of COVID-19 infection. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 27-year-old man who worked as an obstetrics and gynecology resident came to the outpatient clinic with the chief complaints of eye discomfort, foreign body sensation, conjunctival hyperemia, lacrimation, and photophobia in his right eye for the past 3 weeks. Fluorescence test showed a small corneal lesion. The patient was then diagnosed with keratoconjunctivitis. A week after the treatment, all symptoms were resolved. A month later, the patient came to the emergency room with the same eye complaints but with a more severe pain. The fluorescence test showed wider corneal lesion compared to last month. The result from the corneal swab is negative for bacterial or fungal infection, indicating a viral infection. Afterwards, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test from nasopharyngeal swab was performed and revealed that the patient was positive for COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: This case report showed that keratoconjunctivitis may occur as the only manifestation of COVID-19 infection. Thus, patient presented with unexplainable eye symptoms should be evaluated for COVID-19 infection.","Hutama, Satria Audi; Alkaff, Firas Farisi; Intan, Ryan Enast; Maharani, Citra Dewi; Indriaswati, Luki; Zuhria, Ismi",Eur J Ophthalmol,,210

394648,Management Issues of Sarcoidosis in the Time of Coronavirus Disease 2019,2021,"BACKGROUND: Hand hygiene (HH) among healthcare workers (HCWs) is critical for infection prevention and control (IPC) in healthcare facilities (HCFs). Nonetheless, it remains a challenge in HCFs, largely due to lack of high-impact and efficacious interventions. Environmental cues and mobile phone health messaging (mhealth) have the potential to improve HH compliance among HCWs, however, these remain under-studied. Our study will determine the impact of mhealth hygiene messages and environmental cues on HH practice among HCWs in the Greater Kampala Metropolitan Area (GKMA). METHODS: The study is a cluster-randomized trial, which will be guided by the behaviour centred design model and theory for behaviour change. During the formative phase, we shall conduct 30 key informants' interviews and 30 semi-structured interviews to explore the barriers and facilitators to HCWs' HH practice. Besides, observations of HH facilities in 100 HCFs will be conducted. Findings from the formative phase will guide the intervention design during a stakeholders' insight workshop. The intervention will be implemented for a period of 4 months in 30 HCFs, with a sample of 450 HCWs who work in maternity and children's wards. HCFs in the control arm will receive innovatively designed HH facilities and supplies. HCWs in the intervention arm, in addition to the HH facilities and supplies, will receive environmental cues and mhealth messages. The main outcome will be the proportion of utilized HH opportunities out of the 9000 HH opportunities to be observed. The secondary outcome will be E. coli concentration levels in 100mls of hand rinsates from HCWs, an indicator of recent fecal contamination and HH failure. We shall run multivariable logistic regression under the generalized estimating equations (GEE) framework to account for the dependence of HH on the intervention. DISCUSSION: The study will provide critical findings on barriers and facilitators to HH practice among HCWs, and the impact of environmental cues and mhealth messages on HCWs' HH practice.

395223,Clinical characteristics of asymptomatic carriers of novel coronavirus disease 2019: A multi-center study in Jiangsu Province,2020,"Recent works highlighted the significant potential of lung ultrasound (LUS) imaging in the management of subjects affected by COVID-19. In general, the development of objective, fast, and accurate automatic methods for LUS data evaluation is still at an early stage. This is particularly true for COVID-19 diagnostic. In this article, we propose an automatic and unsupervised method for the detection and localization of the pleural line in LUS data based on the hidden Markov model and Viterbi Algorithm. The pleural line localization step is followed by a supervised classification procedure based on the support vector machine (SVM). The classifier evaluates the healthiness level of a patient and, if present, the severity of the pathology, i.e., the score value for each image of a given LUS acquisition. The experiments performed on a variety of LUS data acquired in Italian hospitals with both linear and convex probes highlight the effectiveness of the proposed method. The average overall accuracy in detecting the pleura is 84% and 94% for convex and linear probes, respectively.

Primary outcomes were safety, patient satisfaction, reduction of hospital stay, and cost-effectiveness. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. METHOD: All COVID-19 patients who were discharged with home telemonitoring and oxygen therapy between June 1st and November 1st 2020 were included. Eligible patients had a maximum oxygen requirement of 2 liters per minute during the 24 hours prior to discharge with a minimal peripheral oxygen saturation of 94%. A mobile application for telemonitoring was used, which patients or relatives had to be able to use independently. Patient demographics, clinical parameters, data on telemonitoring and readmissions were extracted from the electronic patient records. A survey for patient satisfaction and a cost-effectiveness analysis were performed. RESULTS: Out of 619 admissions, 49 patients were discharged with home telemonitoring and oxygen therapy. Median duration of home oxygen therapy was 11 days with a potential reduction in hospitalization of 616 days. Six patients were readmitted and were significantly more febrile on discharge (67% versus 14%, p=0.01) and had lower oxygenation (95%, (IQR 93-96) versus 96%, (IQR 95-97), p=0.02) with similar levels of oxygen administration. Patient satisfaction was high with a mean score of 5 to 6 on a scale measuring satisfaction from 1 to 7. Estimated total cost reduction was  146.736. CONCLUSION: This study shows that home telemonitoring and oxygen administration can be safely applied in COVID-19 patients resulting in a high patient satisfaction and reduction in hospital stay and costs.","van Herwerden, Michael C; van Steenkiste, Job; El Moussaoui, Rachida; den Hollander, Jan G; Helfrich, Gea; J A M Verberk, Iris",Ned. tijdschr. geneeskd,,210

401403,Quality Assessment of the Clinical Trial Protocols Regarding Treatments for Coronavirus Disease 2019,2020,"Early community spread of COVID-19 presented a public health crisis and Delmarva’s essential workforce at the poultry processing plants. Plant workers in May 2020 were struggling to adapt to exposure risk and illness in the workforce. Furthermore, pressures of an unfamiliar marketplace strained the supply and demand linkages in poultry processing. By utilizing strategies to meaningfully slow the supply of chicken at the processing plant, farm and hatchery, supply was slowed without stopping. This ensured security in the food supply, but jeopardized farmers raising these livestock. After weeks of processing adjustments, some chicken farms were depopulated as a last resort to protect their welfare. The remains of the depopulated flocks presented a risk to public health from environmental externalities. Across the Delmarva peninsula, carcasses were composted in the housing in which they were raised along with feed, bedding and manure, and high-carbon material, and were carefully monitored to reduce environmental impacts. Compost is recycled into a resource and can be utilized safely on farms for soil conditioning, like organic fertilizer, rather than presenting an environmental disaster. In April and May of 2020, while grocery stores in the United States were being wiped of foodstuffs, public testing for COVID-19 was ramping up. This was in part because of illnesses and calls to action from workers in meat processing plants across the country who were becoming infected with and fearful of the COVID-19 illness. Industry and the Government sprang to action with additional protective equipment, paid sick leave, mandatory health screening, and implementation of the Defense Production Act to ensure American food security. Nearly all citizens were impacted by the disruption in the supply chain of food, such as milk and chicken in the grocery stores, but agribusinesses, farmers, and the environment fell under threat as well. © 2021 Delaware Academy of Medicine.","Brosch, C.; Cartanza, G.",Delaware Journal of Public Health,,210
402108,"Mesenchymal stromal cells for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, and COVID-19 infection: optimizing the therapeutic potential",2020,"BACKGROUND: An effective approach to containing epidemic outbreaks (e.g., COVID-19) is targeted immunization, which involves identifying ""super spreaders"" who play a key role in spreading disease over human contact networks. The ultimate goal of targeted immunization and other disease control strategies is to minimize the impact of outbreaks. It shares similarity with the famous influence maximization problem studied in the field of social network analysis, whose objective is to identify a group of influential individuals to maximize the influence spread over social networks. This study aims to establish the equivalence of the two problems and develop an effective methodology for targeted immunization through the use of influence maximization. METHODS: We present a concise formulation of the targeted immunization problem and show its equivalence to the influence maximization problem under the framework of the Linear Threshold diffusion model. Thus the influence maximization problem, as well as the targeted immunization problem, can be solved by an optimization approach. A Benders' decomposition algorithm is developed to solve the optimization problem for effective solutions. RESULTS: A comprehensive computational study is conducted to evaluate the performance and scalability of the optimization approach on real-world large-scale networks. Computational results show that our proposed approaches achieve more effective solutions compared to existing methods. CONCLUSIONS: We show the equivalence of the outbreak minimization and influence maximization problems and present a concise formulation for the influence maximization problem under the Linear Threshold diffusion model. A tradeoff between computational effectiveness and computational efficiency is illustrated. Our results suggest that the capability of determining the optimal group of individuals for immunization is particularly crucial for the containment of infectious disease outbreaks within a small network. Finally, our proposed methodology not only determines the optimal solutions for target immunization, but can also aid policymakers in determining the right level of immunization coverage.","Cheng, Chun-Hung; Kuo, Yong-Hong; Zhou, Ziye",BMC Med Inform Decis Mak,,210

While it is acknowledged that children who are exposed to FDV have poorer general health, there is a lack of data on the outcomes of children exposed to FDV. The use of longitudinal data has been suggested as a way to gain an understanding of the impact on children's long-term outcomes. METHODS: Our cohort study used deidentified individual-level linked administrative data of children born 1987-2010, in Western Australia, who were exposed to FDV in the prenatal period (12 months prior to birth) to five years of age (early years). RESULTS: Children exposed to FDV are more likely to be hospitalised than non-exposed children. Children exposed to FDV in both the prenatal and early childhood period had a threefold increased odds of mental health hospitalisation. We found a significant increase in odds of pregnancy-related hospitalisation in FDV exposed children. When stratified by Aboriginal status, Aboriginal children had a higher proportion of hospitalisations than non-Aboriginal children. CONCLUSION: Exposed children have an increased likelihood for hospitalisation than non-exposed children. Within the exposed cohort differences were apparent between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children. Aboriginal children had greater odds for hospitalisation in most of the diagnostic groups compared to their non-Aboriginal counterparts. Our findings represent an important advance in the literature with respect to the burden of disease of children exposed to FDV.","Orr, Carol; Fisher, Colleen M; Preen, David B; Glauert, Rebecca A; O039,; Donnell, Melissa",PLoS One,,210
403005,Updated safety precautions and guidance on eye banking procedures during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has spread globally for several months. Because its transmissibility and high pathogenicity seriously threaten people's lives, it is crucial to accurately and quickly detect COVID-19 infection. Many recent studies have shown that deep learning (DL) based solutions can help detect COVID-19 based on chest CT scans. However, most existing work focuses on 2D datasets, which may result in low quality models as the real CT scans are 3D images. Besides, the reported results span a broad spectrum on different datasets with a relatively unfair comparison. In this paper, we first use three state-of-the-art 3D models (ResNet3D101, DenseNet3D121, and MC3 18) to establish the baseline performance on three publicly available chest CT scan datasets. Then we propose a differentiable neural architecture search (DNAS) framework to automatically search the 3D DL models for 3D chest CT scans classification and use the Gumbel Softmax technique to improve the search efficiency. We further exploit the Class Activation Mapping (CAM) technique on our models to provide the interpretability of the results. The experimental results show that our searched models (CovidNet3D) outperform the baseline human-designed models on three datasets with tens of times smaller model size and higher accuracy. Furthermore, the results also verify that CAM can be well applied in CovidNet3D for COVID-19 datasets to provide interpretability for medical diagnosis.

Despite a considerable body of research in the area of forecasting, the focus has largely been on the financial and economic outcomes of the forecasting process as opposed to societal benefits. Our motivation in this study is to promote the latter, with a view to using the forecasting process to advance social and environmental objectives such as equality, social justice and sustainability. We refer to such forecasting practices as Forecasting for Social Good (FSG) where the benefits to society and the environment take precedence over economic and financial outcomes. We conceptualise FSG and discuss its scope and boundaries in the context of the""Doughnut theory"". We present some key attributes that qualify a forecasting process as FSG: it is concerned with a real problem, it is focused on advancing social and environmental goals and prioritises these over conventional measures of economic success, and it has a broad societal impact. We also position FSG in the wider literature on forecasting and social good practices. We propose an FSG maturity framework as the means to engage academics and practitioners with research in this area. Finally, we highlight that FSG: (i) cannot be distilled to a prescriptive set of guidelines, (ii) is scalable, and (iii) has the potential to make significant contributions to advancing social objectives.","Rostami-Tabar, Bahman; Ali, Mohammad M; Hong, Tao; Hyndman, Rob J; Porter, Michael D; Syntetos, Aris",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.11669v1.pdf,210
403301,Strategies for prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 in the dental field,2020,"Background: Verified and authentic information about coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on social networking sites (SNS) could help people make appropriate decisions to protect themselves. However, little is known about what factors influence people's sharing of verified information about COVID-19. Thus, the purpose of this study was to explore the factors that influence people's sharing of verified information about COVID-19 on social networking sites. Methods: Based on social exchange theory, we explore the factors that influence sharing of verified information about COVID-19 from two perspectives: benefits and costs. We employed the survey method to validate our hypothesized relationships. By using our developed measurement instruments, we collected 347 valid responses from SNS users and utilized the partial least squares method to analyze the data. Results: Among the benefits of sharing verified information about COVID-19, enjoyment in helping (ß = 0.357, p = 0.000), altruism (ß = 0.133, p = 0.029) and reputation (ß = 0.202, p = 0.000) were significantly associated with verified information sharing about COVID-19. Regarding the costs of sharing verified information about COVID-19, both verification cost (ß = -0.078, p = 0.046) and executional cost (ß = -0.126, p = 0.011) also significantly affect verified information sharing about COVID-19. All the proposed hypotheses were supported. Conclusions: By exploring factors from both benefits and costs perspectives, we could understand users' intention to share verified information about COVID-19 comprehensively. This study not only contributes to the literature on information sharing, but also has implications concerning users' behaviors on SNS.","Xia, Jiabei; Wu, Tailai; Zhou, Liqin",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,210

Here we describe an engineered human virus receptor, ACE2, by mutagenesis and screening for binding to the receptor binding domain (RBD). Three cycles of random mutagenesis and cell sorting achieved sub-nanomolar affinity to RBD. Our structural data show that the enhanced affinity comes from better hydrophobic packing and hydrogen-bonding geometry at the interface. Additional disulfide mutations caused the fixing of a closed ACE2 conformation to avoid off-target effects of protease activity, and also improved structural stability. Our engineered ACE2 neutralized SARS-CoV-2 at a 100-fold lower concentration than wild type; we also report that no escape mutants emerged in the co-incubation after 15 passages. Therapeutic administration of engineered ACE2 protected hamsters from SARS-CoV-2 infection, decreased lung virus titers and pathology.

When lifting certain mandatory measures for an economic restart, robust surveillance must be established and implemented, with nucleic acid detection for SARS-CoV-2 as an essential component. METHODS: We tried to develop a one-tube detection platform based on RT-RPA (Reverse Transcription and Recombinase Polymerase Isothermal Amplification) and DNA Endonuclease-Targeted CRISPR Trans Reporter (DETECTR) technology, termed OR-DETECTR, to detect SARS-CoV-2. We designed RT-RPA primers of the RdRp and N genes following the SARS-CoV-2 gene sequence. We optimized reaction components so that the detection process could be carried out in one tube. Specificity was demonstrated by detecting nucleic acid samples from pseudoviruses from seven human coronaviruses and Influenza A (H1N1). Clinical samples were used to validate the platform and all results were compared to rRT-PCR. RNA standards and pseudoviruses diluted by different gradients were used to demonstrate the detection limit. Additionally, we have developed a lateral flow assay based on OR-DETECTR for detecting COVID-19. RESULTS: The OR-DETECTR detection process can be completed in one tube, which takes approximately 50 min. This method can specifically detect SARS-CoV-2 from seven human coronaviruses and Influenza A (H1N1), with a low detection limit of 2.5 copies/µl input (RNA standard) and 1 copy/µl input (pseudovirus). Results of six samples from SARS-CoV-2 patients, eight samples from patients with fever but no SARS-CoV-2 infection, and one mixed sample from 40 negative controls showed that OR-DETECTR is 100% consistent with rRT-PCR. The lateral flow assay based on OR-DETECTR can be used for the detection of COVID-19, and the detection limit is 2.5 copies/µl input. CONCLUSIONS: The OR-DETECTR platform for the detection of COVID-19 is rapid, accurate, tube closed, easy-to-operate, and free of large instruments.","Sun, Yangyang; Yu, Lei; Liu, Chengxi; Ye, Shanting; Chen, Wei; Li, Dechang; Huang, Weiren",J Transl Med,,210

This study purposes to investigate the effect of precautionary and preventive measures in limiting the spread of coronavirus in Bahrain. Statistics and the details of precautionary measures described in this study are obtained from websites maintained by the Ministry of Health (MOH) in Bahrain. The calculated number of infected and death cases is determined by using polynomial functions that fit the data. The outcomes obtained showed that the number of cumulative infected and death cases were less than the expected numbers except for certain periods. Reopening stores and businesses that provide direct services to people after their two-week closing resulted in a 36% increased in infected cases than expected in the closing period. When the lockdown continued, the number of infected people dropped to 64% of the total number of detected infections. In accordance with our results, it is expected that the number of infected cases will gradually decrease till late March 2021.

The efficient development of user-friendly DSLs suitable for industrial practitioners with little expertise in modelling still is challenging. For such practitioners, who often do not model on a daily basis, there is a need to foster reduction of repetitive modelling tasks and providing simplified visual representations of DSL parts. For industrial language engineers, there is no methodical support for providing such guidelines or documentation as part of reusable language modules. Previous research either addresses the reuse of languages or guidelines for modelling. For the efficient industrial deployment of DSLs, their combination is essential: the efficient engineering of DSLs from reusable modules that feature integrated documentation and guidelines for industrial practitioners. To solve these challenges, we propose a systematic approach for the industrial engineering of DSLs based on the concept of reusable DSL Building Blocks, which rests on several years of experience in the industrial engineering of DSLs and their deployment to various organizations. We investigated our approach via focus group methods consisting of five participants from industry and research qualitatively. Ultimately, DSL Building Blocks support industrial language engineers in developing better usable DSLs and industrial practitioners in more efficiently achieving their modelling.","Gupta, Rohit; Kranz, Sieglinde; Regnat, Nikolaus; Rumpe, Bernhard; Wortmann, Andreas",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.09682v1.pdf,210
409566,Anosmia: A review in the context of coronavirus disease 2019 and orofacial pain,2020,"Public toilets and bathrooms may act as a contact hub point where community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurs between users. The mechanism of spread would arise through three mechanisms: inhalation of faecal and/or urinary aerosol from an individual shedding SARS-CoV-2; airborne transmission of respiratory aerosols between users face-to-face or during short periods after use; or from fomite transmission via frequent touch sites such as door handles, sink taps, lota or toilet roll dispenser. In this respect toilets could present a risk comparable with other high throughput enclosed spaces such as public transport and food retail outlets. They are often compact, inadequately ventilated, heavily used and subject to maintenance and cleaning issues. Factors such as these would compound the risks generated by toilet users incubating or symptomatic with SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, toilets are important public infrastructure since they are vital for the maintenance of accessible, sustainable and comfortable urban spaces. Given the lack of studies on transmission through use of public toilets, comprehensive risk assessment relies upon the compilation of evidence gathered from parallel studies, including work performed in hospitals and prior work on related viruses.

414482,Is coronavirus disease 2019 associated with indicators of long-term bladder dysfunction?,2021,"By many accounts, the financial technology, or FinTech, sector appears to have developed an innovative solution to assist low-income workers with income shortfalls between standard paydays by displacing fringe financial service providers, namely payday lenders. Earned wage access programs facilitate early transfers of earned-but-unpaid wages to lowincome workers through mobile platforms, algorithmic technology, and GPS tracking. To many, earned wage access programs represent a win-win for employees and employers. These programs are believed to be cheaper and safer alternatives to payday loans. Preliminary research also suggests these programs improve labor-retention rates for employers and help reduce financial distress for low-income employees. Consequently, a growing number of employers, including Walmart Inc. and Amazon.com, Inc., have partnered with earned wage access providers to offer these programs as an employee benefit. Employees may also use third-party providers that bypass employers to offer these programs directly through mobile-app stores. In less than a decade, this nascent market has impressively achieved national scale, hundreds of thousands of employer partnerships, millions of users, and billions of dollars in transactions. Yet, notwithstanding and perhaps because of these early successes, these programs also have downsides that have been much less emphasized. In particular, although the gatekeeping role that employers may play when partnering with earned wage access programs has the potential to facilitate improved pricing and service terms in the fringe financial market, such a role also masks significant costs that are not fully disclosed to employees. Additionally, the earned wage access market creates detrimental regulatory blind spots and enables regulatory arbitrage by blurring the lines between once-distinct financial services: money-transmission services and loan services. Earned wage access programs have largely operated with minimal legal constraints because they have generally been characterized as moneytransmission services, rather than loan services like payday loans. Building on the FinTech literature, by analogy, this Article argues that this blanket characterization of earned wage access programs is a mistake. Earned wage access programs have varying effects. In the absence of regulatory guardrails, some programs can perpetuate, and in some instances exacerbate, the very risks providers claim to eliminate when displacing short-term creditors like payday lenders. This Article proposes a federal-level regulatory framework based on lending laws that addresses some of these unmitigated risks through the imposition of consumer-protection requirements such as uniform price disclosure, ability-to-repay rules, optional amortization mechanics, mandatory credit reporting, and a right-to-rescind assignment. In doing so, this Article aims to facilitate growth of the earned wage access market's functional improvements and prevent a mere shift to fringe FinTech, or ""FringeTech,"" services.","Cuttino, Nakita Q.",Northwestern University Law Review,,210

We report the cystic chest CT findings of 2 patients confirmed to have COVID-19-related pneumonia. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 38-year-old man and a 35-year-old man diagnosed with severe COVID-19 pneumonia were admitted to the intensive care unit. DIAGNOSES: Chest CT findings showed multiple cysts in ground-glass opacities (bilaterally) with/without pneumothorax. The cysts had a smooth inner wall. INTERVENTIONS: The patients continued to be given oxygen by mask and received antitussive, phlegm-dispelling treatment. OUTCOMES: At follow up, there was a reduction in the number of multiple cystic lesions on CT. To date, 1 patient was discharged from hospital, while the other had been transferred to the rehabilitation department. LESSONS: COVID-19 may independently result in pulmonary cyst formation and pneumothorax; the application of a ventilator may be another causative factor.","Liu, Kefu; Zeng, Yuanying; Xie, Ping; Ye, Xun; Xu, Guidong; Liu, Jian; Wang, Hao; Qian, Jinxian",Medicine (Baltimore),,210
418340,N-acetylcysteine and coronavirus disease 2019: May it work as a beneficial preventive and adjuvant therapy? A comprehensive review study,2020,"BACKGROUND: Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) oxidative damage is associated with mortality of patients with different diseases. However, there are no data about DNA and RNA oxidative damage from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Thus, the objective of this study was to explore DNA and RNA oxidative damage in surviving and non-surviving COVID-19 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight Intensive Care Units from 6 hospitals in the Canary Islands (Spain) participated in this prospective and observational study. We recorded the serum levels at ICU admission of the three guanine oxidized species (OGS) because guanine is the nucleobase that forms the DNA and RNA most prone to oxidation. Survival at 30 days was our end-point study. RESULTS: Non-surviving (n = 11) compared to surviving patients (n = 42) had higher APACHE-II (p < 0.001), SOFA (p = 0.004) and serum OGS levels (p = 0.001). In logistic regression analyses an association between serum OGS levels and 30-day mortality after controlling for SOFA (OR=2.601; 95% CI=1.305-5.182; p = 0.007) or APACHE-II (OR=2.493; 95% CI=1.274-4.879; p = 0.008) was found. The area under curve (AUC) for mortality prediction by serum OGS levels was 83% (95% CI=70-92%; p < 0.001), by APACHE II was 85% (95% CI=75-96%; p < 0.001), and by SOFA was 80% (95% CI=66-94%; p < 0.001). No significant differences were found in the AUC between serum OGS levels and SOFA (p = 0.91), and serum OGS levels and APACHE-II (p = 0.64). CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting on oxidative DNA and RNA damage in COVID-19 patients, and the main new finding was that serum OGS concentration was associated with mortality.","Lorente, Leonardo; Martín, María M; González-Rivero, Agustín F; Pérez-Cejas, Antonia; Cáceres, Juan J; Perez, Alina; Ramos-Gómez, Luis; Solé-Violán, Jordi; Marcos Y Ramos, José Alberto; Ojeda, Nazario; Jiménez, Alejandro",Am. j. med. sci,,210

In this pooled retrospective analysis, we describe changes in management patterns for patients with cancer diagnosed with COVID-19 in two academic institutions in the San Francisco Bay Area. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adult and pediatric patients diagnosed with COVID-19 with a current or historical diagnosis of malignancy were identified from the electronic medical record at the University of California, San Francisco, and Stanford University. The proportion of patients undergoing active cancer management whose care was affected was quantified and analyzed for significant differences with regard to management type, treatment intent, and the time of COVID-19 diagnosis. The duration and characteristics of such changes were compared across subgroups. RESULTS: A total of 131 patients were included, of whom 55 were undergoing active cancer management. Of these, 35 of 55 (64%) had significant changes in management that consisted primarily of delays. An additional three patients not undergoing active cancer management experienced a delay in management after being diagnosed with COVID-19. The decision to change management was correlated with the time of COVID-19 diagnosis, with more delays identified in patients treated with palliative intent earlier in the course of the pandemic (March/April 2020) compared with later (May/June 2020) (OR, 4.2; 95% CI, 1.03 to 17.3; P = .0497). This difference was not seen among patients treated with curative intent during the same timeframe. CONCLUSION: We found significant changes in the management of cancer patients with COVID-19 treated with curative and palliative intent that evolved over time. Future studies are needed to determine the impact of changes in management and treatment on cancer outcomes for patients with cancer and COVID-19.","Wu, Julie Tsu-Yu; Kwon, Daniel H; Glover, Michael J; Henry, Solomon; Wood, Douglas; Rubin, Daniel L; Koshkin, Vadim S; Schapira, Lidia; Shah, Sumit A",JCO Oncol Pract,,210

Some level of immunity after SARS-CoV-2 infection is expected; however, the evidence regarding duration and level of protection is still emerging (2). The Kentucky Department for Public Health (KDPH) and a local health department conducted an investigation at a skilled nursing facility (SNF) that experienced a second COVID-19 outbreak in October 2020, 3 months after a first outbreak in July. Five residents received positive SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results during both outbreaks. During the first outbreak, three of the five patients were asymptomatic and two had mild symptoms that resolved before the second outbreak. Disease severity in the five residents during the second outbreak was worse than that during the first outbreak and included one death. Because test samples were not retained, phylogenetic strain comparison was not possible. However, interim period symptom resolution in the two symptomatic patients, at least four consecutive negative RT-PCR tests for all five patients before receiving a positive test result during the second outbreak, and the 3-month interval between the first and the second outbreaks, suggest the possibility that reinfection occurred. Maintaining physical distance, wearing face coverings or masks, and frequent hand hygiene are critical mitigation strategies necessary to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to SNF residents, a particularly vulnerable population at risk for poor COVID-19-associated outcomes.* Testing, containment strategies (isolation and quarantine), and vaccination of residents and health care personnel (HCP) are also essential components to protecting vulnerable residents. The findings of this study highlight the importance of maintaining public health mitigation and protection strategies that reduce transmission risk, even among persons with a history of COVID-19 infection.","Cavanaugh, Alyson M; Thoroughman, Douglas; Miranda, Holly; Spicer, Kevin",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,210

MethodsFrom May until September, 2020, we tested visitors to 20 clinics, for COVID-19 in five neighborhoods of Port-au-Prince as part of a public health effort to determine prevalence of COVID-19 in the general community. In order to estimate changes in number of deaths, the team visited eighteen funeral homes to solicit data on the number of funerals conducted for each month in 2019 and through October 2020. We also sought to evaluate the attitudes of Port-au-Prince citizens towards a generic COVID-19 vaccine in April 2021. ResultsIn May and July 2020, 11.4% and 9.1% of those tested were positive for antibodies to COVID-19, respectively. The number of funerals held in the Port-au-Prince area increased by 69.6.% (CI 95% 56.1-83.1) since the official arrival of COVID-19 on March 19th. We found high rates of vaccine hesitancy with 76% saying they would not take a free COVID-19 vaccine. Further research is needed to validate the findings here, but there are strong suggestions that COVID-19 has had more of an impact than previously reported. What is already known on this subject?Very little is known about the true epidemiology of COVID-19 in Haiti due to lack of testing, stigma, and lack of resources. The Ministry of Health reports Haiti has had 10,781 confirmed (first case March 19th) and 45,927 suspected cases of COVID-19, with 240 official deaths. Most officials accept these numbers as vast underestimates. What does this study add?This study estimates a prevalence of 10% for COVID-19 antibodies in the population of Port-au-Prince in May to August 2020. Only 19-38% of those surveyed with confirmed antibodies reported experiencing symptoms in the last few months prior to the survey. We found a 69% increase in funerals per month in Port-au-Prince for the first six months post-COVID (March 2020) compared to the 14 months prior. Finally, we found significant vaccine hesitancy with only 24% reporting ""Yes"" or ""Maybe"" when asked if theyd take a free of charge vaccine.","DEGENNARO, VINCENT; Henderson, Rebecca; Schwartz, Timothy; Elie, Marie-Carmelle",,,210

Sero prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies may help in more accurate estimations of the total number of cases. Nevertheless, the disparity in the differences in the total number of fatalities between Italy and China suggests investigation into several factors, such as demographics, sociological interactions, availability of medical equipment (ICU beds and PPE), variants in immune proteins (e.g., HLA, IFNs), past immunity to related CoVs, and mutations in SARS-CoV-2, could impact survival of severe COVID-19 illness survival and the number of case fatalities.","Rubino, Salvatore; Kelvin, Nikki; Bermejo-Martin, Jesús F; Kelvin, David",J Infect Dev Ctries,,210

In the context of this particular decision, little is known about what treatment-related factors are important and how they are prioritized in order to arrive at a treatment preference. METHODS: The Hydrocephalus Association electronically distributed a survey to surgically treated hydrocephalus patients or their families. Respondents rated the importance of various surgical attributes in their decision-making about treatment choice, and also indicated their preference in hypothetical scenarios involving a trade-off between potential risks and benefits of treatment. Rank-order correlations were used to determine whether certain predictor variables affected the rating of factors or hypothetical treatment choice. RESULTS: Eighty percent of 414 respondents rated procedural risks, minimizing repeat surgery, and improving long-term brain function as being very or extremely important factors when deciding on a treatment; 69% rated the need to implant a permanent device similarly. Parent-respondents rated procedural risks higher than patient-respondents. A majority of respondents (n = 209, 54%) chose a procedure with higher surgical risk if it meant that implantation of a permanent device was not required, and respondents were more likely to choose this option if they discussed both treatment options with their surgeon prior to their initial intervention (Spearman rho 0.198, p = 0.001).Although only 144 of 384 total respondents (38%) chose a less established operation if it meant less repeat surgery, patient-respondents were more likely to choose this option compared to parent-respondents (Spearman rho 0.145, p = 0.005). Likewise, patient-respondents were more likely than parent-respondents to choose an operation that involved less repeat surgery and led to worse long-term brain function (Spearman rho 0.160, p = 0.002), an option that was chosen by only 23 (6%) of respondents overall. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first exploration of patient/parental factors that influence treatment preference in pediatric hydrocephalus. Procedural risks, minimizing repeat operations, and the desire to maximize long-term cognitive function appeared to be the most important attributes that influenced treatment decisions that the survey respondents had made in the past. Patients and/or their caregivers appear to see some inherent benefit in being shunt free. It appears that fear of multiple revision operations may drive treatment choice in some circumstances.","Tamber, Mandeep S; Naftel, Robert P",J Neurosurg Pediatr,,210
434641,"Policy for Coronavirus Disease-2019 Tests During the Public Health Emergency (Revised): Immediately in Effect Guidance for Clinical Laboratories, Commercial Manufacturers, and Food and Drug Administration Staff",2020,"Herein, we consider venous immunothrombotic mechanisms in SARS-CoV-2 infection and anti-SARS-CoV-2 DNA vaccination. Primary SARS-CoV-2 infection with systemic viral RNA release (RNAaemia) contributes to innate immune coagulation cascade activation, with both pulmonary and systemic immunothrombosis - including venous territory strokes. However, anti-SARS-CoV-2 adenoviral-vectored-DNA vaccines -initially shown for the ChAdOx1 vaccine-may rarely exhibit autoimmunity with autoantibodies to Platelet Factor-4 (PF4) that is termed Vaccine-Induced Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia (VITT), an entity pathophysiologically similar to Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). The PF4 autoantigen is a polyanion molecule capable of independent interactions with negatively charged bacterial cellular wall, heparin and DNA molecules, thus linking intravascular innate immunity to both bacterial cell walls and pathogen-derived DNA. Crucially, negatively charged extracellular DNA is a powerful adjuvant that can break tolerance to positively charged nuclear histone proteins in many experimental autoimmunity settings, including SLE and scleroderma. Analogous to DNA-histone interactons, positively charged PF4-DNA complexes stimulate strong interferon responses via Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) 9 engagement. A chain of events following intramuscular adenoviral-vectored-DNA vaccine inoculation including microvascular damage; microbleeding and platelet activation with PF4 release, adenovirus cargo dispersement with DNA-PF4 engagement may rarely break immune tolerance, leading to rare PF4-directed autoimmunity. The VITT cavernous sinus cerebral and intestinal venous territory immunothrombosis proclivity may pertain to venous drainage of shared microbiotal-rich areas of the nose and in intestines that initiates local endovascular venous immunity by PF4/microbiotal engagement with PF4 autoantibody driven immunothrombosis reminiscent of HIT. According to the proposed model, any adenovirus-vectored-DNA vaccine could drive autoimmune VITT in susceptible individuals and alternative mechanism based on molecular mimicry, vaccine protein contaminants, adenovirus vector proteins, EDTA buffers or immunity against the viral spike protein are secondary factors. Hence, electrochemical DNA-PF4 interactions and PF4-heparin interactions, but at different locations, represent the common denominator in HIT and VITT related autoimmune-mediated thrombosis.","McGonagle, Dennis; De Marco, Gabriele; Bridgewood, Charles",J Autoimmun,,210
436493,Prevalence and Clinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Seen at a Testing Centre in Lagos Nigeria,2021,"OBJECTIVE: In patients with mild COVID-19 pneumonia, chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is advised when risk factors for severe disease (i.e., age > 65 years and/or comorbidities) are present, and can influence management strategy. The objective was to assess whether HRCT is associated to short-time development of severe disease in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: Seventy-seven consecutive patients (mean age, 64 ± 15 years) with mild COVID-19 pneumonia (no or mild respiratory failure) that underwent HRCT were retrospectively identified. Fifty-two on 77 patients had reported risk factors for severe disease. A chest-imaging devoted radiologist recorded, on a per-examination basis, the following HRCT features: ground-glass opacity, crazy-paving pattern, consolidation, organizing pneumonia (OP) pattern, mosaic attenuation, and nodules. The extent of each feature (total feature score, TFS) was semi-quantitatively assessed. Total lung involvement (TLI) was defined as the sum of all TFSs. The study outcome was defined as the occurrence of severe disease (moderate-to-severe respiratory failure) within 15 days from HRCT. Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess if age, comorbidities, and HRCT features were associated to severe disease. RESULTS: On univariable analysis, severe disease was significantly associated with age > 59 years (29/47 patients, 61.7%) (p = 0.013), and not significantly associated with having comorbidities (22/44 patients, 50.0%). On multivariable analysis, TLI >15 and OP pattern >5 were independently associated to severe disease, with odds ratio of 8.380 (p = 0.003), and of 4.685 (p = 0.035), respectively. CONCLUSION: Short-time onset of severe COVID-19 was associated to TLI >15 and OP pattern score > 5.

This article shows how the development of Sustainable Tourism can help in the sustenance of the tourism industry, since one of the premises on which Sustainable Tourism is based is the non-overcrowding of tourist destinations (essential factor in the current context). Considering this argument and the existing regulations on lockdown rules, social distancing and meet up, it is considered that the practices in Sustainable Tourism can become a potential solution to stimulate tourist movements and help the revival of the tourism industry. Therefore, more specifically, the main objective of this article is to know tourist´s perception among about Sustainable Tourism and to determine which factors help its development. In this sense, the use of structural equation models in a research of 308 tourists has determined how factors related to the tourists' attitude, motivation and perceived benefits provided by the development of Sustainable Tourism increase the intention to consume this type of tourism.

437443,"Our Italian experience using lung ultrasound for identification, grading and serial follow-up of severity of lung involvement for management of patients with COVID-19",2020,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbates the risk for mental health issues of university students. The aims of the study were to investigate the prevalence of anxiety, depression and stress among university students during the period of the first lockdown in Germany, and the associations of possible risk and protective factors with all three outcome variables. Methods A total of 2.548 university students were included in the study. The study took place during the period of the first lockdown in Germany. Multiple hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to explore the role of demographic variables, personality traits, psychological capital variables, mindfulness, COVID-19 related variables, and coping strategies on anxiety, depression and stress. Results Results showed on average mild depressive and anxiety symptoms, and moderate perceived stress among the students. Alarmingly, 35.9% of the students showed a moderate-to-severe level of depression, 27.7% reported moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety, and 25.1% perceived high stress. Mindfulness and optimism were the most relevant protective factors against depression, anxiety and stress, whereas COVID-related stressors (e.g., worries about study and financial problems, being stressed by the Corona-pandemic and media reporting, quarantine experience) as well as personal characteristics (e.g., neuroticism, older age, being female) were risk factors for increasing mental health issues and/ or stress. Conclusion The pandemic has negatively affected the mental health of students. The results emphasize the importance of both professional help for students with mental health problems and effective prevention programs on university campuses that promote coping skills, and mental health during the current pandemic.","Karing, Constance",Journal of Affective Disorders Reports,,210
438240,Analysis of European Air Medical Evacuation Flights of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patients,2021,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk factors for hospitalizations of cases with positive and negative COVID-19 tests. METHODS: In this case-control study, the case and control groups consisted of 292 COVID-19 patients and 296 non-COVID-19 patients. Patients who referred to a reference laboratory in Tehran (Iran) in March 2020 were selected and interviewed. The patients were contacted by telephone and data were recorded through a questionnaire. RESULTS: The sample of this study consisted of 588 patients (349 [59%] females, 239 [41%] males) with a mean age of 42 ± 15. The results of this study showed that comorbidities like diabetes (OR = 7.42), hypertension (OR = 4.85), asthma and respiratory diseases (OR = 5.64) in addition to symptoms including fever (OR = 6.67), chills (OR = 11.2), anorexia (OR = 11.3), dyspnea (OR = 4.8), weakness and lethargy (OR = 5.7) were the most predictive variables for hospitalization of non-COVID-19 cases. Furthermore, demographical variables like male gender (OR = 3.71), high age (>50; OR = 3.12), BMI (>25; OR = 2.37), travel (OR = 2.79), comorbidities including diabetes (OR = 5.26), hypertension (OR = 3.7) and underlying immunosuppressant patients receiving corticosteroid therapy (OR = 3.62) in addition to symptoms like anorexia [OR = 2.55] and dyspnea (OR = 6.99) tend to increase the risk of hospital admission in COVID-19 patients, suggesting their predictive values for hospitalization of COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that different factors tend to increase the odds of hospital admission in patients with positive and negative COVID-19 tests, suggesting their predictive values for hospitalization.","Ghanei, Mostafa; Keyvani, Hossein; Haghdoost, Aliakbar; Abolghasemi, Hassan; Janbabaei, Ghasem; Reza Jamshidi, Hamdi; Hosein Ghazale, Amir; Hassan Saadat, Seyed; Gholami Fesharaki, Mohammad; Raei, Mehdi",Int Immunopharmacol,,210

METHODS: Healthy adults (nâ =â 8) were recruited to investigate the impact of the short-term exposure of lithium heparin samples (centrifuged and uncentrifuged) inside 2 LabLocker-KF300 courier lockboxes placed outside in direct sunlight during summer. Each courier lockbox was monitored every 5 minutes with a temperature data logger and contained either the standard number (nâ =â 2) of cold packs (cold) or no standard cold packs (warm). Acceptable tolerance limits were defined for each analyte by significant change limit (SCL) analysis (Pâ <â .05), as previously described. RESULTS: Significant changes were identified in each study condition for warm and cold lockbox conditions. Aspartate aminotransferase, glucose, lactate dehydrogenase, and potassium commonly crossed SCLs from mean baseline (t0) in the majority of conditions.

Our understanding of that question has been dictated by holism, as defined by the biopsychosocial model, since the late twentieth century. Unfortunately, holism was characterized at the start with confused definitions of 'dualism' and 'reductionism', and that problem has led to a deep, unrecognized conceptual split in the medical professions. Some insist that holism is a nonreductionist approach that aligns with some form of dualism, while others insist it's a reductionist view that sets out to eradicate dualism. It's important to consider each version. Nonreductive holism is philosophically consistent and clinically unproblematic. Reductive holism, however, is conceptually incoherent-yet it is the basis for the common idea that the boundary between medical and mental health disorders must be vague. When we trace that idea through to its implementation in medical practice, we find evidence that it compromises the safety of patient care in the large portion of cases where clinicians grapple with diagnosis at the boundary between psychiatry and medicine. Having established that medicine must embrace some form of nonreductionism, I argue that Chalmers' naturalistic dualism is a stronger prima facie candidate than the nonreductive alternatives. Regardless of which form of nonreductionism we prefer, some philosophical corrections are needed to give medicine a safe and coherent foundation.","O039,; Leary, Diane",Synthese,,210

In Portugal, the number of cases increased continually (32700 confirmed cases as of May 31, 2020), which has affected the health system and caused movement restrictions which in turn affects the air pollution in the country. This article analyses the indirect effect produced by this pandemic on air pollution in Portugal, by comparison of data from a period of movement restriction of the citizens by the government - COVID lockdown period (March-May 2020) with data from baseline conditions (mean of the mirrored periods from the five previous years (March-May from 2015 to 2019)). Air quality data - in particular NO2 and PM10 hourly concentration - from more than 20 monitoring stations spread over mainland Portugal was used to perform this evaluation. The mean reduction observed on pollutant concentrations was higher for NO2 (41%) than for PM10 (18%). For NO2, mean reductions were more significant in traffic (reaching values higher than 60% in some monitoring stations) and background urban sites than in rural stations. The reduction of NO2 concentration observed in traffic sites were compared to the estimation of traffic contribution by the incremental method, suggesting that this latter approach is not consistent (lower in same sites and higher in others) and alerting to the careful use of this approach in future works.","Gama, Carla; Relvas, Hélder; Lopes, Myriam; Monteiro, Alexandra",Environ Res,,210

Upon expansion, disease loci acquire heterochromatic characteristics, which may provoke changes to chromatin conformation and thereby affect both gene expression and repeat instability. Here, we tested this hypothesis by performing 4C sequencing at the DMPK and HTT loci from DM1 and HD-derived cells. We find that allele sizes ranging from 15 to 1700 repeats displayed similar chromatin interaction profiles. This was true for both loci and for alleles with different DNA methylation levels and CTCF binding. Moreover, the ectopic insertion of an expanded CAG repeat tract did not change the conformation of the surrounding chromatin. We conclude that CAG/CTG repeat expansions are not enough to alter chromatin conformation in cis. Therefore, it is unlikely that changes in chromatin interactions drive repeat instability or changes in gene expression in these disorders.","Ruiz Buendía, Gustavo A; Leleu, Marion; Marzetta, Flavia; Vanzan, Ludovica; Tan, Jennifer Y; Ythier, Victor; Randall, Emma L; Marques, Ana C; Baubec, Tuncay; Murr, Rabih; Xenarios, Ioannis; Dion, Vincent",Sci.

The correlation coefficient (CC) between two variables plays an important role in statistics. Likewise, the accuracy of relevance assessment depends on the information in a set of discourses. The data collected for numerous statistical studies is full of exceptions. The concept of the neutrosophic hypersoft set (NHSS) is a parameterized family that deals with the subattributes of the parameters and is a proper extension of the neutrosophic soft set to accurately assess the deficiencies, anxiety, and uncertainty in decision-making. Compared with existing research, NHSS can accommodate more uncertainty, which is the most significant technique for describing fuzzy information in the decision-making process. The core objective of follow-up research is to develop the concept and characteristics of CC and the weighted correlation coefficient (WCC) of NHSS. We also introduced some aggregation operators in the considered environment, which can help us establish a prioritization technique for order preference by similarity to the ideal solution (TOPSIS) based on CC and WCC under NHSS. A decision-making strategy is established to solve multicriteria group decision-making (MCGDM) problems utilizing developed methodology. Moreover, the proposed method is utilized for the selection of an effective hand sanitizer during the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure the validity of the proposed approach. The practicality, effectivity, and flexibility of the current approach are proved through comparative analysis with the assistance of some existing studies.","Samad, Abdul Rana Muhammad Zulqarnain Sermutlu Emre Rifaqat Ali Siddique Imran Jarad Fahd Thabet Abdeljawad",Complexity,,210

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of COVID-19 lockdown restrictions on physical activity and mental health of children and young adults with physical and/or intellectual disabilities. METHODS: The study was a cross-sectional design. Parents/carers completed an electronic survey in the UK between June-July 2020 on behalf of their child. Through Likert scales and free-text questions, the survey asked about physical activity levels and mental health during lockdown compared to before, access to specialist facilities and equipment to aid with physical activity, and the short- and long-term concerns around ongoing lockdown restrictions. RESULTS: Generally, respondents reported negative effects of lockdown restrictions, with 61% reporting a reduction in physical activity levels and over 90% reporting a negative impact on mental health (including poorer behaviour, mood, fitness and social and learning regression). Many respondents cited a lack of access to specialist facilities, therapies and equipment as reasons for this, and raised concerns about the long-term effects of this lack of access on their child's mental health and physical activity levels. CONCLUSIONS: The survey highlights the negative impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on the physical activity levels and mental health of children and young adults with disabilities and highlights the importance of addressing the needs of the disabled community as restrictions are eased.","Theis, Nicola; Campbell, Natalie; De Leeuw, Julie; Owen, Marie; Schenke, Kimberley C",Disabil Health J,,210

Mobility plays a central role in this dilemma because the movement of people enables both economic activity and virus spread. We use mobility data in the form of counts of travellers between regions, to extend the often-used SEIR models to include mobility between regions. We quantify the trade-off between mobility and infection spread in terms of a single parameter, to be chosen by policy makers, and propose strategies for restricting mobility so that the restrictions are minimal while the infection spread is effectively limited. We consider restrictions where the country is divided into regions, and study scenarios where mobility is allowed within these regions, and disallowed between them. We propose heuristic methods to approximate optimal choices for these regions. We evaluate the obtained restrictions based on our trade-off. The results show that our methods are especially effective when the infections are highly concentrated, e.g. around a few municipalities, as resulting from superspreading events that play an important role in the spread of COVID-19. We demonstrate our method in the example of the Netherlands. The results apply more broadly when mobility data are available.","Gösgens, Martijn; Hendriks, Teun; Boon, Marko; Steenbakkers, Wim; Heesterbeek, Hans; van der Hofstad, Remco; Litvak, Nelly",J R Soc Interface,,210

The UK Armed Forces followed these to protect the force and ensure readiness to respond to various tasking requests. Clinical training has adapted to ensure geographically dispersed medical personnel are trained while social distancing is maintained. This study aimed to evaluate remote training for Combat Medical Technicians, Medical Assistants and Royal Air Force Medics (CMTs/MAs/RAFMs) during the COVID-19 pandemic and the views of trainers on how this should be delivered now and in the future. METHODS: A mixed quantitative and qualitative survey study was conducted to determine the experiences of a sample of Defence Medical Services personnel with remote training during the COVID-19 pandemic. Medical and nursing officers involved in teaching CMTs/MAs/RAFMs were eligible to participate. RESULTS: There were 52 survey respondents. 78% delivered remote training to CMTs/MAs/RAFMs, predominantly using teleconferencing and small-group webinars. 70% of respondents report CMTs/MAs/RAFMs received more training during the COVID-19 pandemic than before. 94% of respondents felt webinar-based remote training should continue after COVID-19. The perceived benefits of webinar-based training included reduced travel time, more training continuity and greater clinical development of learners. CONCLUSIONS: The challenge of continuing education of medical personnel while maintaining readiness for deployment and adhering to the Government's social distancing measures was perceived to have been met within our study sample. This suggests that such an approach, along with clear training objectives and teleconferencing, may enable personnel to deliver high-quality training in an innovative and secure way.","Hodgetts, James Michael; Claireaux, H A; Naumann, D N",,,210

458581,Late-onset endocarditis after coronavirus disease 2019 infection,2021,"BackgroundA novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which emerged at the end of 2019 and causes COVID-19, has resulted in worldwide human infections. While genetically distinct, SARS-CoV-1, the aetiological agent responsible for an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002-2003, utilises the same host cell receptor as SARS-CoV-2 for entry: angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Parts of the SARS-CoV-1 spike glycoprotein (S protein), which interacts with ACE2, appear conserved in SARS-CoV-2.AimThe cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-2 of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) previously generated against the S protein of SARS-CoV-1 was assessed.MethodsThe SARS-CoV-2 S protein sequence was aligned to those of SARS-CoV-1, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and common-cold coronaviruses. Abilities of mAbs generated against SARS-CoV-1 S protein to bind SARS-CoV-2 or its S protein were tested with SARS-CoV-2 infected cells as well as cells expressing either the full length protein or a fragment of its S2 subunit. Quantitative ELISA was also performed to compare binding of mAbs to recombinant S protein.ResultsAn immunogenic domain in the S2 subunit of SARS-CoV-1 S protein is highly conserved in SARS-CoV-2 but not in MERS and human common-cold coronaviruses. Four murine mAbs raised against this immunogenic fragment could recognise SARS-CoV-2 S protein expressed in mammalian cell lines. In particular, mAb 1A9 was demonstrated to detect S protein in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and is suitable for use in a sandwich ELISA format.ConclusionThe cross-reactive mAbs may serve as useful tools for SARS-CoV-2 research and for the development of diagnostic assays for COVID-19.","Zheng, Zhiqiang; Monteil, Vanessa Marthe; Maurer-Stroh, Sebastian; Yew, Chow Wenn; Leong, Carol; Mohd-Ismail, Nur Khairiah; Cheyyatraivendran Arularasu, Suganya; Chow, Vincent Tak Kwong; Lin, Raymond Tzer Pin; Mirazimi, Ali; Hong, Wanjin; Tan, Yee-Joo",Euro surveill,,210

In this period of quarantine, one of the reasons for going out is physical activity. This issue is important, as the impact of a sedentary lifestyle might be lower for children and young adults, but is far more severe for older adults. Although older adults need to stay at home because they have a higher risk of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), they need to avoid a sedentary lifestyle. Physical activity is important for older adults, especially to maintain their level of independence, mental health, and well-being. Maintaining mobility in old age is necessary, as it may predict loss of independence in older adults. OBJECTIVE: Our first objective was to evaluate the impact of this quarantine period on physical activity programs and on the physical and mental health of older adults. Our second objective was to discuss alternatives to physical activity programs that could be suggested for this population to avoid a sedentary lifestyle. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative survey using semistructured interviews with professionals (managers in charge of physical activity programs for older adults and sports trainers who run these physical activity programs) from the French Federation of Physical Education and Voluntary Gymnastics (FFPEVG) and older adults participating in a physical activity program of the FFPEVG. We followed a common interview guide. For analysis, we carried out a thematic analysis of the interviews. RESULTS: This study suggests that the COVID-19 epidemic has affected, before quarantine measures, the number of seniors attending group physical activity programs in the two study territories. In addition, despite the decline in their participation in group physical activities before the quarantine, older adults expressed the need to perform physical activity at home. There is a need to help older adults integrate simple and safe ways to stay physically active in a limited space. A national policy to support older adults for physical activity at home appears essential in this context. CONCLUSIONS: Given the results of our study, it seems necessary to globally communicate how important it is for older adults to maintain physical activity at home. We are concerned about the level of independence and mental health state of older adults after the end of quarantine if there is no appropriate campaign to promote physical activity among them at home.","Goethals, Luc; Barth, Nathalie; Guyot, Jessica; Hupin, David; Celarier, Thomas; Bongue, Bienvenu",JMIR Aging,,210

Coronavirus is a family of viruses that is more lethal than other unpremeditated viruses. In December 2019, a new variant, i.e., a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) developed in Wuhan province, China. Since January 23, 2020, the number of infected individuals has increased rapidly, affecting the health and economies of many countries, including Pakistan. The objective of this research is to provide a system to classify and categorize the COVID-19 outbreak in Pakistan based on the data collected every day from different regions of Pakistan. This research also compares the performance of machine learning classifiers (i.e., Decision Tree (DT), Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine, and Logistic Regression) on the COVID-19 dataset collected in Pakistan. According to the experimental results, DT and NB classifiers outperformed the other classifiers.

This disease poses an extraordinary challenge for public health systems because screening and surveillance capacity is often severely limited, especially during the beginning of the outbreak; this can fuel the outbreak, as many patients can unknowingly infect other people. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to collect and analyze posts related to COVID-19 on Weibo, a popular Twitter-like social media site in China. To our knowledge, this infoveillance study employs the largest, most comprehensive, and most fine-grained social media data to date to predict COVID-19 case counts in mainland China. METHODS: We built a Weibo user pool of 250 million people, approximately half the entire monthly active Weibo user population. Using a comprehensive list of 167 keywords, we retrieved and analyzed around 15 million COVID-19-related posts from our user pool from November 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020. We developed a machine learning classifier to identify ""sick posts,"" in which users report their own or other people's symptoms and diagnoses related to COVID-19. Using officially reported case counts as the outcome, we then estimated the Granger causality of sick posts and other COVID-19 posts on daily case counts. For a subset of geotagged posts (3.10% of all retrieved posts), we also ran separate predictive models for Hubei province, the epicenter of the initial outbreak, and the rest of mainland China. RESULTS: We found that reports of symptoms and diagnosis of COVID-19 significantly predicted daily case counts up to 14 days ahead of official statistics, whereas other COVID-19 posts did not have similar predictive power. For the subset of geotagged posts, we found that the predictive pattern held true for both Hubei province and the rest of mainland China regardless of the unequal distribution of health care resources and the outbreak timeline. CONCLUSIONS: Public social media data can be usefully harnessed to predict infection cases and inform timely responses. Researchers and disease control agencies should pay close attention to the social media infosphere regarding COVID-19. In addition to monitoring overall search and posting activities, leveraging machine learning approaches and theoretical understanding of information sharing behaviors is a promising approach to identify true disease signals and improve the effectiveness of infoveillance.","Shen, Cuihua; Chen, Anfan; Luo, Chen; Zhang, Jingwen; Feng, Bo; Liao, Wang",J Med Internet Res,,210

Using a square-root operation, it has been suggested that a square-root HOTI may emerge in a hybrid honeycomb-kagome lattice. Here, we report the first experimental realization of the square-root HOTI in topological LC circuits. We show theoretically and experimentally that the square-root HOTI inherits the feature of wave function from its parent with corner states pinned to nonzero energies. The topological feature is fully characterized by the bulk polarization. To directly measure the finite-energy corner modes, we introduce extra grounded inductors to each node, which shifts corner states to zero-energy without affecting their spatial distributions. Our results experimentally substantiate the emerging square-root HOTI and pave the way to realizing exotic topological phases that are challenging to observe in condensed matter physics.","Song, Lingling; Yang, Huanhuan; Cao, Yunshan; Yan, Peng",,,210

We collected structured data regarding MG and COVID-19, which was diagnosed as probable or confirmed according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control case definition. We compared confirmed-COVID-19 prevalence calculated from the beginning of the pandemic in MG patients with that of the overall Pavia district. RESULTS: We interviewed 162 MG patients (median age, 66 y; interquartile range 41-77; males 59.9%), 88 from the Pavia district. Three patients had SARS-CoV-2-confirmed by polymerase chain reaction and eight had probable-COVID-19. In the Pavia district, the prevalence of confirmed-COVID-19 among MG patients (1/88, 1.14%) and overall population (4777/546 515, 0.87%) did not differ (P = .538). Higher Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America clinicalclass and the need for recent rescue treatment, but not ongoing immunosuppressive treatments, were associated with COVID-19 risk. Of 11 MG patients with probable/confirmed-COVID-19, 3 required ventilator support, and 2 elderly patients died of COVID-19 respiratory insufficiency. Only 1 of11 patients experienced worsening MG symptoms, which improved after increasing their steroid dose. DISCUSSION: The risk of COVID-19 in MG patients seems to be no higher than that of the general population, regardless of immunosuppressive therapies. In our cohort, COVID-19 barely affected MG course.","Businaro, Pietro; Vaghi, Gloria; Marchioni, Enrico; Diamanti, Luca; Arceri, Sebastiano; Bini, Paola; Colombo, Elena; Cosentino, Giuseppe; Alfonsi, Enrico; Costa, Alfredo; Ravaglia, Sabrina; Mallucci, Giulia; Ballante, Elena; Franciotta, Diego; Gastaldi, Matteo",Muscle Nerve,,210

This study, which employed a cross-sectional design, aimed to assess the mental health of emergency department medical staff during the epidemic in China. METHODS: Demographic data and mental health measurements were collected by electronic questionnaires from February 28, 2020 to March 18, 2020. OUTCOMES: A total of 14,825 doctors and nurses in 31 provinces of mainland China completed the survey. The prevalence rates of depressive symptoms and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were 25.2% and 9.1%, respectively. Men were more likely to have depressive symptoms and PTSD than women. Those who were middle aged, worked for fewer years, had longer daily work time, and had lower levels of social support were at a higher risk of developing depressive symptoms and PTSD. Working in the Hubei province was associated with a higher risk of depressive symptoms, while those working in the Hubei province but residing in another province had a lower risk of depressive symptoms and PTSD. Being a nurse was associated with a higher risk of PTSD. INTERPRETATION: The findings suggest that targeted psychological interventions to promote the mental health of medical staff with psychological problems need to be immediately implemented. Special attention should be paid to local medical staff in Hubei.","Song, Xingyue; Fu, Wenning; Liu, Xiaoran; Luo, Zhiqian; Wang, Rixing; Zhou, Ning; Yan, Shijiao; Lv, Chuanzhu",Brain Behav Immun,,210
467903,The characteristic peripheral blood morphological features of hospitalized patients infected with COVID-19,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 causes a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations and significant mortality. Studies investigating underlying immune characteristics are needed to understand disease pathogenesis and inform vaccine design. In this study, we examined immune cell subsets in hospitalized and non-hospitalized individuals. In hospitalized patients, many adaptive and innate immune cells were decreased in frequency compared to healthy and convalescent individuals, with the exception of B lymphocytes which increased. Our findings show increased frequencies of T-cell activation markers (CD69, Ox40, HLA-DR and CD154) in hospitalized patients, with other T-cell activation/exhaustion markers (CD25, PD-L1 and TIGIT) remaining elevated in hospitalized and non-hospitalized individuals. B cells had a similar pattern of activation/exhaustion, with increased frequency of CD69 and CD95 during hospitalization, followed by an increase in PD1 frequencies in non-hospitalized individuals. Interestingly, many of these changes were found to increase over time in non-hospitalized longitudinal samples, suggesting a prolonged period of immune dysregulation following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Changes in T-cell activation/exhaustion in non-hospitalized patients were found to positively correlate with age. Severely infected individuals had increased expression of activation and exhaustion markers. These data suggest a prolonged period of immune dysregulation following SARS-CoV-2 infection highlighting the need for additional studies investigating immune dysregulation in convalescent individuals.","Files, Jacob K; Boppana, Sushma; Perez, Mildred D; Sarkar, Sanghita; Lowman, Kelsey E; Qin, Kai; Sterrett, Sarah; Carlin, Eric; Bansal, Anju; Sabbaj, Steffanie; Long, Dustin M; Kutsch, Olaf; Kobie, James; Goepfert, Paul; Erdmann, Nathaniel",J. clin. invest,,210

The disease has been a challenge for all. The clinical manifestations of Covid-19 ranges from no symptoms at all to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. Anosmia being one of the important clinical features of COVID-19 has always been overlooked by the Indian population. This formed the background for this study. Aim To identify the incidence of anosmia reported in COVID- 19 patients in India. Materials and Methods Literature search was carried out from January 2020 to March 2021 in databases like PUBMED and Google Scholar using the key words ""ANOSMIA"", ""HYPOSMIA"" and ""OLFACTORY DYSFUNCTION"" in conjunction with ""COVID-19"", ""SARS-COV-2"", and ""CORONAVIRUS"". Boolean operators were used to narrow and broaden the search. The search yielded sixteen eligible articles. Result The scrutiny of the 16 articles revealed an incidence range of anosmia from 9.2% to 82% and an average anosmia incidence rate of 30.19%. The cumulative incidence rate of anosmia in those studies where objective analysis was done is 52.2% and 16.4% for subjective analysis. Discussion The prevalence of anosmia in Indian population is found to be much lesser than that reported by European countries due to ethnicity or negligence. Objective evaluation of anosmia in COVID-19 patients increases the incidence of anosmia drastically. Hence objective evaluations such as UPIST, SNIFFING STICK test, etc. is to be promoted. This study also Emphasises the lack of common gold standard testing for olfaction like vision and hearing.","Aanand, Prem; Angral, Sumeet; Varshney, Saurabh; Raj, Ritu",Indian J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,,210
468996,Mid-ventricular Takotsubo syndrome 'lockdown'-related during coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak: a case report,2020,"BACKGROUND: The competence of the person delivering person-to-person behaviour change interventions may influence the effectiveness of the intervention. However, we lack a framework for describing the range of competences involved. The objective of the current work was to develop a competency framework for health behaviour change interventions. METHOD: A preliminary framework was developed by two judges rating the relevance of items in the competency framework for cognitive behaviour therapies; adding relevant items from reviews and other competency frameworks; and obtaining feedback from potential users on a draft framework. The Health Behaviour Change Competency Framework (HBCCF) was used to analyse the competency content of smoking cessation manuals. RESULTS: Judges identified 194 competency items as relevant, which were organised into two domains: foundation (12 competency topics comprising 56 competencies) and behaviour change (12 topics, 54 competencies); several of the 54 and 56 competencies were composed of sub-competencies (84 subcompetencies in total). Smoking cessation manuals included 14 competency topics from the foundation and behaviour change competency domains. CONCLUSION: The HBCCF provides a structured method for assessing and reporting competency to deliver behaviour change interventions. It can be applied to assess a practitioner's competency and training needs and to identify the competencies needed for a particular intervention. To date, it has been used in self-assessments and in developing training programmes. We propose the HBCCF as a practical tool for researchers, employers, and those who design and provide training. We envisage the HBCFF maturing and adapting as evidence that identifies the essential elements required for the effective delivery of behaviour change interventions emerges.","Dixon, Diane; Johnston, Marie",Int. j. behav. med,,210
469215,Kinetics of peripheral blood neutrophils in severe coronavirus disease 2019,2021,"As of December 1, 2020, nearly 64 million people have been infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 worldwide with nearly 1.5 million global deaths. The impact of this virus has continued to overwhelm hospital infrastructure and demanded remodeling of healthcare systems. With rising concerns for a third, and possibly the largest, wave of individuals infected with the virus, national leaders are continuing to seek avenues by which we can further limit disease transmission and prevent infection with the use of vaccination. To our knowledge, no clinical trial evaluating vaccines to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 has included pregnant women. In December 2020, it was anticipated that the Food and Drug Administration will approve at least 1 or 2 mRNA-based coronavirus disease 2019 vaccine under the Emergency Use Authorization based on phase 3 clinical trial efficacy data. Both Pfizer and Moderna have manufactured mRNA-based vaccines with 95% and 94.1% efficacy against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. AstraZeneca has manufactured a vaccine using a viral vector demonstrating early efficacy as well, and this next-generation platform has previously been utilized with the Ebola vaccine and safely administered during pregnancy with an acceptable safety profile. Approval of these vaccines will have a tremendous impact on the ongoing pandemic, yet there remains a lack of data for use of coronavirus disease 2019 vaccine in pregnant women. In this article, we seek to discuss the available data regarding treatment and prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 in pregnancy and address the growing questions regarding how best to approach vaccine access and administration in the pregnant population.","Craig, Amanda M; Hughes, Brenna L; Swamy, Geeta K",Am J Obstet Gynecol MFM,,210
469546,Periodontal connections to the coronavirus disease 2019: An unexplored novel path?,2020,"Many patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) are acutely malnourished and often require aggressive and early nutrition support with parenteral nutrition (PN). However, PN-induced hyperglycemia is a predictor of hospital mortality and is associated with increased length of stay. Elevated blood glucose in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is also associated with increased mortality. Real-time continuous glucose monitoring (rtCGM) is primarily used in the outpatient setting, but there is rapidly growing interest in its applicability to help treat dysglycemia in critically ill patients, especially during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We assessed the use of rtCGM data (Dexcom G6) in a 58-year-old male admitted to the ICU for severe COVID-19 infection, who developed PN-induced hyperglycemia with markedly elevated total daily insulin requirements as high as 128 units. rtCGM was used to safely titrate insulin infusion and monitor glucose levels. No episodes of hypoglycemia were observed, despite an extremely aggressive insulin regimen. This case demonstrates the potential utility of rtCGM in the critical care setting and highlights its potential to help conserve personal protective equipment and minimize unnecessary staff exposure in the setting of COVID-19.","Chow, Kenneth W; Kelly, Danielle J; Gupta, Rajarsi; Miller, Joshua D",JPEN J. parenter. enteral nutr,,210

METHODS: Our prognostic study was based on the 25 years outcomes of a Boston braced AIS cohort between 1978 and 1993 that were previously reported. All patients were followed-up during bracing, at short term and 25 years post-bracing. We evaluated the impact of socio-demographic, clinical and radiological parameters on the loss of curve correction after bracing. RESULTS: Seventy-seven patients were reevaluated at 25 years post-brace. The mean scoliotic curve was significantly increased after bracing until the 25 years follow-up (p < 0.001). The mean loss of curve correction between the end of bracing and long-term follow-up was independent on the curve type, apical vertebra, premenarcheal status at bracing, time and duration of bracing, Cobb angle before or after bracing. The mean apical vertebral rotation after bracing was significantly related to the loss of curve correction (Spearman &#961; = 0.2, p = 0.049). Apical vertebral rotation (Perdriolle method) greater than 20° post-bracing had a three times higher chance of progression > 5° compared with lesser apical vertebral rotation (OR 3.071, CI 0.99-9.51). The rotation of the apical vertebra, type and magnitude of the scoliotic curve after bracing explained 27.4% of the variance in the loss of curve correction post-bracing (R square = 0.274, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: A scoliotic curve is expected to lose some correction after bracing. The apical vertebral rotation post-bracing mainly affected the long-term curve behaviour. Adolescents with apical vertebral rotation greater than 20° after bracing may need further attention.

Method: A 23-year-old highly myopic man presented with reduced vision in the right eye while under medical quarantine due to direct exposure to COVID-19 infection. Five days after developing mild COVID symptoms (fever, cough and anosmia) he noticed acute painless loss of central vision in his right eye. Systemic evaluation at presentation was positive for SARS-CoV-2 detected via both a pharyngeal swab and serologic titers. Dilated fundus exam was performed, followed by color fundus pictures, optic coherence tomography (OCT), fundus autofluorescence (FAF) and fluorescein angiography (FA). Results: Fundoscopic examination of the right eye revealed the presence of multiple discrete, slightly elevated yellow-whitish placoid lesions at the posterior pole. The visual acuity was 20/800. The left eye was normal with 20/20 vision. The patient was placed on oral corticosteroids and the lesions rapidly improved. Conclusion: The patient had an MFC chorioretinitis around the same time that he had a documented acute covid infection. Though the temporal relationship could be by chance alone, communicating this case to the ophthalmic community is warranted to see if other similar cases are noted.","de Souza, Eduardo Cunha; de Campos, Vania Ewert; Duker, Jay S",Am J Ophthalmol Case Rep,,210

The education policy during the epidemic has achieved positive results. Those results aim to ensure the physical and mental health of teachers and students, ensure the supply of epidemic prevention materials and educational resources, ensure the quality of students' learning, and enhance the application ability of teachers' teaching technology. The process of policy changes and effects of policy implementation have been examined to analyze how China’s education responses to COVID-19. The characteristics and experience of China's education policy in response to the epidemic concentrate on forming a governance system under the centralized and unified leadership of the Communist Party of China, building a pattern in which families and schools cooperate closely to promote the smooth development of education and teaching, transforming from an emergency substitute during the crisis into an important motivation to promote the transformation of education paradigm, and paying great attention to remote and poor areas and disadvantaged student groups.","Xue, Eryong; Li, Jian; Li, Tingzhou; Shang, Weiwei",Educ.Philos.

472715,Quality improvement in the time of coronavirus disease 2019 - A change strategy well suited to pandemic response,2020,"COVID-19, caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2, is a disease characterised by cough, fever and fatigue, which progresses to life-threatening lung injury in approximately 5% of patients. The SARS-CoV-2 virus enters the cell via ACE2. ACE2 is a component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) which has an important counterregulatory effect on the classical ACE-dependent pathway. Several antihypertensives increase ACE2 expression or activity, leading to concern that this may facilitate SARS-CoV-2 entry and worsen COVID-19 disease. However, ACE2 is protective against lung injury while ANG II (which is catabolised by ACE2) is associated with lung injury both in mice and humans. We propose that medications which inhibit the RAS ACE-dependent pathway may be beneficial in treating COVID-19 and should be explored in animal models and clinical trials. Here we give an overview of the RAS pathway with respect to COVID-19 and argue that strategies which manipulate this pathway might reduce the destructive lung manifestations of COVID-19 and improve patient outcomes.","Sturrock, Beattie Rh; Milne, Kate M; Chevassut, Timothy Jt",Clin Med (Lond),,210

Objective: To characterize self-reported experiences and views of hospital capacity managers regarding the 2017-2018 influenza season in the US. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this qualitative study, semistructured telephone interviews were conducted between April 2018 and January 2019 with a random sample of capacity management administrators responsible for throughput and hospital capacity at short-term, acute care hospitals throughout the US. Main Outcomes and Measures: Each participant's self-reported experiences and views regarding high patient volumes during the 2017-2018 influenza season, lessons learned, and the extent of hospitals' preparedness planning for future pandemic events. Interviews were recorded and transcribed and then analyzed using thematic content analysis. Outcomes included themes and subthemes. Results: A total of 53 key hospital capacity personnel at 53 hospitals throughout the US were interviewed; 39 (73.6%) were women, 48 (90.6%) had a nursing background, and 29 (54.7%) had been in the occupational role for more than 4 years. Participants' experiences were categorized into several domains: (1) perception of strain, (2) effects of influenza and influenza-like illness on staff and patient care, (3) immediate staffing and capacity responses to influenza and influenza-like illness, and (4) future staffing and capacity preparedness for influenza and influenza-like illness. Participants reported experiencing perceived strain associated with concerns about preparedness for seasonal influenza and influenza-like illness as well as concerns about staffing, patient care, and capacity, but future pandemic planning within hospitals was not reported as being a high priority. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this qualitative study suggest that during the 2017-2018 influenza season, there were systemic vulnerabilities as well as a lack of hospital preparedness planning for future pandemics at US hospitals.

Rhoifolin, 5,7-dimethoxyflavanone-4'-O-ß-d-glucopyranoside, baicalin, astragalin, luteolin, and kaempferol showed good binding affinity and thus these could be promising compounds. In-silico screening such as ADMET prediction has been performed which predicted that the selected flavonoids have good pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics properties. Molecular dynamics simulation studies and MM-PBSA binding free energy calculations showed luteolin to be a more effective candidate against viral protein Mpro.

Due to the rapid outbreak of the transmission (~3.64 million positive cases and high mortality as of 5 May 2020), the world is looking for immediate and better therapeutic options. Still, much information is not known, including origin of the disease, complete genomic characterization, mechanism of transmission dynamics, extent of spread, possible genetic predisposition, clinical and biological diagnosis, complete details of disease-induced pathogenicity, and possible therapeutic options. Although several known drugs are already under clinical evaluation with many in repositioning strategies, much attention has been paid to the aminoquinoline derivates, chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). These molecules are known regulators of endosomes/lysosomes, which are subcellular organelles central to autophagy processes. By elevating the pH of acidic endosomes/lysosomes, CQ/HCQ inhibit the autophagic process. In this short perspective, we discuss the roles of CQ/HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19 patients and propose new ways of possible treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection based on the molecules that selectivity target autophagy.Abbreviation: ACE2: angiotensin I converting enzyme 2; CoV: coronavirus; CQ: chloroquine; ER: endoplasmic reticulum; HCQ: hydroxychloroquine; MERS-CoV: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; SARS-CoV: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.","Bonam, Srinivasa Reddy; Muller, Sylviane; Bayry, Jagadeesh; Klionsky, Daniel J",Autophagy,,210

We carried out a narrative review of the literature up to November 1st, 2020, related to the safety of hydroxychloroquine. In particular, cutaneous and extra-cutaneous adverse events associated with hydroxychloroquine were reviewed. The following databases were consulted: PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar and ResearchGate. The research of articles was conducted by using the following search terms: ''hydroxychloroquine,"" ''adverse event/effect,'' ""cutaneous"", ""skin"", ""cardiotoxicity"", ""retinopathy"", gastrointestinal and neurological toxicity"". The main indication for which hydroxychloroquine was used in the reports was an immune mediated disorder. Adverse events were described mostly in females over 50 years of age. The most common cutaneous adverse effect was maculopapular and erythematous rash occurring within 4 weeks of initiating hydroxychloroquine and disappearing within few weeks of discontinuation. Gastrointestinal symptoms and headache were the most frequent extracutaneous manifestations. Rarer cutaneous manifestations include hyperpigmentation, psoriasiform dermatitis, photodermatitis, stomatitis, melanonychia and hair loss. More severe conditions were acute generalised exanthematous pustulosis, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis, and among extra-cutaneous adverse events cardiotoxicity and retinopathy.

In the present investigation, we assessed nasopharyngeal suctioning as a mitigation strategy to decrease particulate spread during simulated endonasal surgical activity. METHODS: Airborne particulate generation in the 1-µm to 10-µm range was quantified with an optical particle sizer in real-time during cadaveric-simulated anterior and posterior endonasal drilling and cautery conditions. To test suction mitigation, experiments were performed both with and without a rigid suction placed in the contralateral nostril, terminating in the nasopharynx. RESULTS: Both anterior (medial maxillary wall and nasal septum) and posterior (sphenoid rostrum) drilling produced significant particulate generation in the 1-µm to 10-µm range throughout the duration of drilling (p < 0.001) without the use of suction, whereas nasopharyngeal suction use eliminated the detection of generated airborne particulate. A similar effect was seen with nasal cautery, with significant particle generation (p < 0.001) that was reduced to undetectable levels with the use of nasopharyngeal suction. CONCLUSION: The use of nasopharyngeal suctioning via the contralateral nostril minimizes airborne particulate spread during simulated sinonasal drilling and cautery. In the era of COVID-19, this technique offers an immediately available measure that may increase surgical safety.","Workman, Alan D; Xiao, Roy; Feng, Allen; Gadkaree, Shekhar K; Quesnel, Alicia M; Bleier, Benjamin S; Scangas, George A",Int. forum allergy rhinol,,210
480307,Coronavirus Disease 2019 and Cardiac Arrhythmias,2020,"BackgroundTelemedicine services worldwide have experienced an unprecedented boom since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Multiple studies have noted telemedicine as an effective alternative to traditional face-to-face management of patients. This study provides insight into public perception and impression of telemedicine in Hong Kong, specifically among the elderly who are the most vulnerable to COVID-19. MethodsFace-to-face surveys were conducted on elderly relatives of current medical students at the Chinese University of Hong Kong who were aged [≥] 60 years. The survey included socio-demographic details; past medical history; and concerns towards telemedicine use. Univariate and multivariable regression analyses were conducted to examine statistically significant associations. The primary outcomes are consideration of telemedicine use during: (1) a severe outbreak; and (2) after the COVID-19 pandemic. Results109 surveys were conducted. Multivariable regression analyses revealed that expectation of government subsidies for telemedicine services was the strongest common driver, and also the only positive independent predictors of telemedicine use for both during a severe outbreak, as well as after the COVID-19 pandemic. No negative independent predictors of telemedicine use during severe outbreak were found. Negative independent predictors of telemedicine use after the COVID-19 pandemic included old age, and living in the New Territories. ConclusionsGovernment support such as telemedicine-specific subsidies will be crucial in promoting telemedicine use in Hong Kong both during a severe outbreak and after the current COVID-19 pandemic. Robust dissemination of information regarding the pros and cons of telemedicine towards the public, especially towards the elderly population, is warranted.","Choi, Maxwell Chun Yin; Chu, Shing Him; Siu, Lok Lam; Tse, Anakin Gajy; Wu, Justin Che Yuen; Fung, Hong; Chiu, Billy Chi Fai; Mok, Vincent Chung Tong",,,210

We develop an optimization framework for fitting the nonconvex regularization surface and present finite-sample error bounds for estimation of the regression function. Our methods and analyses accommodate the general setting where groups overlap. As an application of group selection, we study sparse semiparametric modeling, a procedure that allows the effect of each predictor to be zero, linear, or nonlinear. For this task, the new estimators improve across several metrics on synthetic data compared to alternatives.

In this report, we will focus on a management model covering the two phases of the COVID-19 emergency, namely lockdown-phase I and post-lockdown-phase II. METHODS: The following steps were taken in the two phases: workload during visits and radiotherapy planning, use of dedicated routes, measures for triage areas, management of suspected and positive COVID-19 cases, personal protective equipment, hospital environments and intra-institutional meetings and tumor board management. Due to the guidelines set out by the Ministry of Health, oncological follow-up visits were interrupted during the lockdown-phase I; consequently, we set about contacting patients by telephone, with laboratory and instrumental exams being viewed via telematics. During the post-lockdown-phase II, the oncological follow-up clinic reopened, with two shifts operating daily. RESULTS: By comparing our radiotherapy activity from March 9 to May 4 2019 with the same period in 2020 during full phase I of the COVID-19 emergency, similar results were achieved. First radiotherapy visits, Simulation Computed Tomography and Linear Accelerator treatments amounted to 123, 137 and 151 in 2019 compared with 121, 135 and 170 in 2020 respectively. There were no cases of COVID-19 positivity recorded either in patients or in healthcare professionals, who were all negative to the swab tests performed. CONCLUSION: During both phases of the COVID-19 emergency, the planned model used in our own experience guaranteed both continuity in radiotherapy treatments whilst neither reducing workload nor interrupting treatment and, as such, it ensured the safety of cancer patients, hospital environments and staff.","Caravatta, Luciana; Rosa, Consuelo; Di Sciascio, Maria Bernadette; Tavella Scaringi, Andrea; Di Pilla, Angelo; Ursini, Lucia Anna; Taraborrelli, Maria; Vinciguerra, Annamaria; Augurio, Antonietta; Di Tommaso, Monica; Trignani, Marianna; Nuzzo, Marianna; Falco, Maria Daniela; De Nicola, Andrea; Adorante, Nico; Patani, Fabiola; Centofanti, Giuseppe; Gasparini, Lucrezia; Fasciolo, David; Di Guglielmo, Fiorella Cristina; Bonfiglio, Cecilia; Borgia, Marzia; Caravaggio, Gabriella; Marcucci, Stefano; Turchi, Consalvo; Mancinelli, Domenico; Sartori, Stephanie; Schael, Thomas; Muraglia, Angelo; Caputi, Sergio; D039,; Amario, Claudio; Verì, Nicoletta; Genovesi, Domenico",Radiat Oncol,,210

We conducted a retrospective analysis of all patients (n = 69) who underwent liposuction for treatment of lipoedema between 2004 and 2019, and gathered data on patient age, body mass index, the number of liposuction sessions, and the amount of fat removed per side. The study also prospectively evaluated the QoL in 20 lipoedema patients before and after liposuction using the Freiburg Life Quality Assessment for lymphatic diseases questionnaire. The mean age was 50.6 ± 12.8 years, and the average number of liposuction sessions performed was 2.9 ± 1.9, with a mean volume of 1868 ± 885.5 mL of fat removed per side. Before treatment with liposuction, disease-specific QoL in patients with lipoedema was low on every single subscale as well as on the global score and showed a significant improvement in all aspects after liposuction. There was a significant correlation between a higher number of liposuction treatment sessions and general health status in lipoedema patients (P = .007). Liposuction greatly improves the QoL in lipoedema patients. A higher number of liposuction treatment sessions seem to have a positive effect on general health status in these patients.","Schlosshauer, Torsten; Heiss, Christian; von Hollen, Ann-Kathrin; Spennato, Stefano; Rieger, Ulrich M",Int. wound j,,210

492190,The impact of the coronavirus disease of 2019 on research,2020,"BACKGROUND: During disease outbreaks, nurses express concerns regarding the organizational and social support required to manage role conflicts. OBJECTIVES: The study examined concerns, threats, and attitudes relating to care provision during the COVID-19 outbreak among nurses in Israel. DESIGN: A 53-item questionnaire was designed for this research, including four open-ended questions. The article used a qualitative research to analyze the responses to the open-ended questions and their association with responses to the close-ended ones. PARTICIPANTS AND RESEARCH CONTEXT: In all, 231 registered nurses and fourth-year nursing students throughout the whole country. The questionnaire was delivered in nursing Facebook and WhatsApp groups and through snowball sampling. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: The research was pre-approved by the Ethics Committee at the researchers' university. RESULTS: Nurses mostly referred to personal risk, followed by dilemmas regarding care provision. On average, 38.6% of quotations stated that during the pandemic, nurses are not asked to perform unfair duties. Nurses discussed activities and requirements that impact their personal and familial safety, their relationship with employer, organization or the state, and their duty to providing care. Other than fear of contraction, respondents' most frequent themes of concerns were related to work condition and patients' interests, inter-collegiate relationships, and uncertainty and worries about the future. Respondents' ethical dilemmas mostly referred to clinical questions, providing care without adequate equipment or managerial support, and in conditions of uncertainty and increased risk. DISCUSSION: Nurses raise important issues concerning their relationships with employers and family members, and significant insights regarding the pandemic and their revised responsibilities and definition of work. They raise serious concerns regarding their rights at work and their standing for them. CONCLUSIONS: Health managers should find ways to enhance the ethical climate and institutional support to enable a better work-life balance in times of pandemic and support nurses' working needs and labor rights.","Sperling, Daniel",Nurs Ethics,,210

OBJECTIVES: to analyze the effectiveness of the measurement of specific antibodies to SARS-CoV2 (IgM and IgG) for the diagnosis of COVID-19 and to analyze the rate of SARS-CoV2 seroprevalence in the population. METHODS: 11 relevant studies, published before June 5, 2020, were included in this meta-analysis. These studies were identified by searching the MEDLINE and Scopus databases. The final selected studies were analyzed using STATA version 14. Publication bias was examined using both Egger's test and Funnel plots. Moreover, the I² statistic has been used to evaluate and verify heterogeneity. RESULTS: The 11 relevant studies selected for the present meta-analysis cover a total of 996 infection cases. According to the results, the average rate of positive cases for IgM (AU/mL) was 2.10 (95% CI: 1.65-2.55; I2=92.2%), and the sensitivity in individuals with positive IgM test was 63% (95% CI: 47-79; I2=94.9%). In addition, the average rate of positive cases for IgG (AU/mL) was 67.44 (95% CI: 28.79-106.09; I2=99.4%), and the sensitivity in individuals with positive IgG test was 79% (95% CI: 67-90; I2=89.5%). CONCLUSIONS: According to this analysis, detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies may assist early detection of SARS-CoV2 infection. Whether antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 confer protective immunity warrants further studies.","Fathi, Mobina; Vakili, Kimia; Sayehmiri, Fatemeh; Mohamadkhani, Ashraf; Ghanbari, Reza; Hajiesmaeili, Mohammadreza; Rezaei-Tavirani, Mostafa",Iran J Immunol,,210

Here, we demonstrate an essential role of GATA6 antisense RNA 1 (GATA6-AS1) in cardiomyocyte differentiation from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). GATA6-AS1 is adjacent to cardiac transcription factor GATA6. We found that GATA6-AS1 was nuclear-localized and transiently upregulated along with GATA6 during the early stage of cardiomyocyte differentiation. The knockdown of GATA6-AS1 did not affect undifferentiated cell pluripotency but inhibited cardiomyocyte differentiation, as indicated by no or few beating cardiomyocytes and reduced expression of cardiomyocyte-specific proteins. Upon cardiac induction, the knockdown of GATA6-AS1 decreased GATA6 expression, altered Wnt-signaling gene expression, and reduced mesoderm development. Further characterization of the intergenic region between genomic regions of GATA6-AS1 and GATA6 indicated that the expression of GATA6-AS1 and GATA6 were regulated by a bidirectional promoter within the intergenic region. Consistently, GATA6-AS1 and GATA6 were co-expressed in several human tissues including the heart, similar to the mirror expression pattern of GATA6-AS1 and GATA6 during cardiomyocyte differentiation. Overall, these findings reveal a previously unrecognized and functional role of lncRNA GATA6-AS1 in controlling human cardiomyocyte differentiation.","Jha, Rajneesh; Li, Dong; Wu, Qingling; Ferguson, Katherine E; Forghani, Parvin; Gibson, Gregory C; Xu, Chunhui",FASEB j,,210
493805,Comorbidities and severity of coronavirus disease 2019 patients,2020,"COVID-19 is proving to be the long awaited 'big one': a pandemic capable of bringing societies and economies to their knees. There is an urgent need to examine how COVID-19 - as a health and development crisis - unfolded the way it did it and to consider possibilities for post-pandemic transformations and for rethinking development more broadly. Drawing on over a decade of research on epidemics, we argue that the origins, unfolding and effects of the COVID-19 pandemic require analysis that addresses both structural political-economic conditions alongside far less ordered, 'unruly' processes reflecting complexity, uncertainty, contingency and context-specificity. This structural-unruly duality in the conditions and processes of pandemic emergence, progression and impact provides a lens to view three key challenges areas. The first is how scientific advice and evidence are used in policy, when conditions are rigidly 'locked in' to established power relations and yet so uncertain. Second is how economies function, with the COVID-19 crisis having revealed the limits of a conventional model of economic growth. The third concerns how new forms of politics can become the basis of reshaped citizen-state relations in confronting a pandemic, such as those around mutual solidarity and care. COVID-19 demonstrates that we face an uncertain future, where anticipation of and resilience to major shocks must become the core problematic of development studies and practice. Where mainstream approaches to development have been top down, rigid and orientated towards narrowly-defined economic goals, post-COVID-19 development must have a radically transformative, egalitarian and inclusive knowledge and politics at its core.","Leach, Melissa; MacGregor, Hayley; Scoones, Ian; Wilkinson, Annie",World Dev,,210

We conducted a matched retrospective cohort study to compare clinical outcomes among SOT recipients with the general population and to assess immunosuppression management. METHODS: Adult SOT recipients with laboratory PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to a tertiary-care hospital in Barcelona, Spain, from March 11th to April 25th 2020, were matched to controls (1:4) on the basis of sex, age and age-adjusted Charlson's Index. Patients were followed for up to 28 days from admission or until censored. Primary endpoint was mortality at 28 days. Secondary endpoints included admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and secondary complications. Drug-drug interactions (DDI) between immunosuppressants and COVID-19 management medication were collected. RESULTS: Forty-six transplant recipients and 166 control patients were included. Mean (SD) age of transplant recipients and controls was 62.7 (12.6) and 66.0 (12.7) years, 33 (71.7%) and 122 (73.5%) were male, and median (IQR) Charlson's Index was 5 (3-7) and 4 (2-7), respectively. Mortality was 37.0% in SOT recipients and 22.9% in controls (p=0.51).Thirty-three (71.7%) patients underwent transitory discontinuation of immunosuppressants due to potential or confirmed DDI. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, hospitalized SOT recipients with COVID-19 had a trend toward higher mortality compared to controls, although it was not statistically significant, and a notable propensity for DDI.","Miarons, Marta; Larrosa-García, María; García-García, Sonia; Los-Arcos, Ibai; Moreso, Francesc; Berastegui, Cristina; Castells, Lluís; Pérez-Hoyos, Santiago; Varela, Javier; Pau-Parra, Alba; Varón-Galcera, Carlota; Parramon-Teixidó, Carlos-Javier; Martínez-Casanova, Javier; Domènech, Laura; García-Ortega, Patricia; Sánchez-Sancho, Pablo; Alonso-Martínez, Carla; Gómez-Ganda, Laura; Roch-Santed, Maria; Gracia-Moya, Ariadna; Del-Rio-Gutiérrez, José-Manuel; Guillén-Del-Castillo, Alfredo; Sans-Pola, Carla; Antón, Andrés; Montoro, Bruno; Gorgas-Torner, Maria-Queralt",Transplantation,,210

The quick adoption of telemedicine occurred out of necessity for social distancing, and evidence-based approaches are needed to determine the future utility of this approach to delivering care. The objective of this study was to identify factors associated with both provider and patient satisfaction with telemedicine visits in a primary care setting during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: This survey-based study was conducted in 2020. Surveys were distributed electronically by e-mail to providers and patients. Participants: Surveys related to satisfaction levels with telemedicine were distributed to 73 primary care providers and 6,626 patients. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary measures of this study were satisfaction level with telemedicine in primary care. Results: Studies were completed by 23 primary care providers and 1,692 patients. Most patient participants were female (70.8%), white (89.7%), non-Hispanic or non-Latino (96.6%), and Massachusetts residents (96.9%). Variables that were found to be significantly associated with higher levels of satisfaction with telemedicine visits included: travel time saved >30 min (odds ratio [OR] 1.8), having an easy visit connection (OR = 3.2), use of Zoom© video visit over telephone only (OR = 2.8), and identifying as female (OR 1.8). Conclusions and Relevance: Patients and providers reported high levels of satisfaction with telemedicine visits in a primary care setting. Providers felt that telemedicine visits usually take the same amount or less time than in-person visits. Both providers and patients reported a desire to see telemedicine visits continued after the pandemic. Patients who saved more than 30 min of travel time found it easy to connect or those who were female were more likely to be satisfied with telemedicine visits, while those that had telephone visits were less likely to be satisfied than those that had Zoom© visits.","Vosburg, R Wesley; Robinson, Kortney A",Telemed. j. e. health,,210

We present the method with reference to the Celling Sex project, which worked with young women who have transactional sex experience. Four key steps in our unique model are discussed: (a) individual cellphilm-making; (b) participatory analysis; (c) creating a composite video; (d) publicly screening the work. We consider how working individually with participants in the cellphilm-making process built trust. We unpack how offering participants opportunities to engage in either group or one-on-one activities promoted participation in collaborative analysis. We outline how creating a composite video of the cellphilms and organising screenings facilitated knowledge translation and exchange. Overall, the quilted cellphilm method created a supportive community for vulnerable participants to generate products that challenged social stigma. Increased reliance on mobile media, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, makes the quilted cellphilm method an opportune, exciting and accessible approach for participatory public health research.","MacEntee, Katie; Kendrick, Caterina; Flicker, Sarah",Glob Public Health,,210

Methods Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) scale, patient health questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), generalized anxiety disorder-7 (GAD-7) and impact of event scale-revised (IES-R) were used to evaluate the sleep and psychological status of officers and soldiers in a naval force stationed in Hubei province. Results A total of 238 questionnaires were sent out, and 232 valid questionnaires were collected, with an effective rate of 97.5%. The median score of PSQI scale was 2.00 (1.00, 5.00), and poor and very poor sleep qualities accounted for 5.6% (13/232) and 0.9% (2/232), respectively. The median score of PHQ-9 was 0.00 (0.00, 2.00), and mild, moderate and severe depression accounted for 12.1% (28/232), 0.9% (2/232) and 0.4% (1/232), respectively. The median score of GAD-7 was 0.00 (0.00, 0.00), and mild anxiety was found in 7.8% (18/232) participants. The median score of IES-R was 1.00 (0.00, 5.00), and mild and moderate psychological stress accounted for 12.5% (29/232) and 1.3% (3/232), respectively. Conclusion The sleep quality and psychological status of the officers and soldiers from the naval force stationed in Hubei are generally good during the COVID-19 epidemic. A small proportion of them have mild psychosomatic disorders, such as poor sleep quality, depression, anxiety and psychological stress reaction. Psychological counseling and humanistic care should be given to better maintain the physical and mental health of naval forces and ensure their combat capability.","Jin-Yang, Li; Ping, Xiao; Yun-Xiang, Tang; Hao, Wang; Shu-Yu, Xu; Jing-Zhou, Xu; Tong, Su",Acad.

496504,Novel coronavirus disease 2019 pharmacological treatments: A review,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer and questioning (LGBTQ+) people and populations face myriad health disparities that are likely to be evident during the COVID-19 pandemic. The objectives of our study were to describe patterns of COVID-19 testing among LGBTQ+ people and to differentiate rates of COVID-19 testing and test results by sociodemographic characteristics. METHODS: Participants residing in the United States and US territories (N = 1090) aged &#8805;18 completed an internet-based survey from May through July 2020 that assessed COVID-19 testing and test results and sociodemographic characteristics, including sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI). We analyzed data on receipt and results of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and antibody testing for SARS-CoV-2 and symptoms of COVID-19 in relation to sociodemographic characteristics. RESULTS: Of the 1090 participants, 182 (16.7%) received a PCR test; of these, 16 (8.8%) had a positive test result. Of the 124 (11.4%) who received an antibody test, 45 (36.3%) had antibodies. Rates of PCR testing were higher among participants who were non-US-born (25.4%) versus US-born (16.3%) and employed full-time or part-time (18.5%) versus unemployed (10.8%). Antibody testing rates were higher among gay cisgender men (17.2%) versus other SOGI groups, non-US-born (25.4%) versus US-born participants, employed (12.6%) versus unemployed participants, and participants residing in the Northeast (20.0%) versus other regions. Among SOGI groups with sufficient cell sizes (n > 10), positive PCR results were highest among cisgender gay men (16.1%). CONCLUSIONS: The differential patterns of testing and positivity, particularly among gay men in our sample, confirm the need to create COVID-19 public health messaging and programming that attend to the LGBTQ+ population.","Martino, Richard J; Krause, Kristen D; Griffin, Marybec; LoSchiavo, Caleb; Comer-Carruthers, Camilla; Karr, Anita G; Bullock, Allie F; Halkitis, Perry N",Public Health Rep,,210

When Should It be Concerned?,2021,"BackgroundIn March 2020, a directive to halt all elective and non-urgent procedures was issued in Ontario, Canada because of COVID-19. The directive caused a temporary slowdown of screening programs including surveillance colonoscopies for colorectal cancer (CRC). Our goal was to determine if there was a difference in patient and tumour characteristics between CRC patients treated surgically prior to the COVID-19 directive compared to CRC patients treated after the slowdown. MethodsCRC resections collected within the Champlain catchment area of eastern Ontario in the six months prior to COVID-19 (August 1, 2019-January 31, 2020) were compared to CRC resections collected in the six months post-COVID-19 slowdown (August 1, 2020-January 31, 2021). Clinical (e.g. gender, patient age, tumour site, clinical presentation) and pathological (tumour size, tumour stage, nodal stage, lymphovascular invasion) features were evaluated using chi square tests, T-tests and Mann-Whitney tests where appropriate. Results343 CRC specimens were identified (175 pre-COVID-19, 168 post-COVID-19 slowdown). CRC patients treated surgically post-COVID-19 slowdown had larger tumours (44 mm vs. 35 mm; p = 0.0048) and were more likely to have presented emergently (24% vs .10%; p < 0.001). While there was a trend towards higher tumour stage, nodal stage, and clinical stage, these differences did not reach statistical significance. Other demographic and pathologic variables including patient gender, age, and tumour site were similar between the two cohorts. InterpretationThe COVID-19 slowdown resulted in a shift in the severity of disease experienced by CRC patients in Ontario. Pandemic planning in the future should consider the long-term consequences to cancer diagnosis and management.","Forse, Catherine L; Petkiewicz, Stephanie; Teo, Iris; Purgina, Bibianna M; Klaric, Kristina-Ana; Ramsay, Tim; Wasserman, Jason K",,,210

Being the largest tertiary care health facility under Delhi Government, our center was designated as a 2000 bedded dedicated COVID hospital. In addition to establishing areas for COVID management, COVID Obstetrics and Gynecology area requires a dedicated set up for delivering women, an operating room, and a neonatal care unit. A phased evacuation plan begins by curtailing non-emergency services and postponing elective surgeries, this process may take longer for obstetrics than other specialties on account of labor and postnatal care. The percentage reduction in the number of elective obstetric and gynecological surgeries was 73% and further fell by 98% (n = 4;category C, D) over a period of 1 month of the evacuation phase, whereas the reduction in emergency cases was only 15% (n = 200) in the beginning and fell to 89%. During the surge phase of COVID, we were able to increase the inpatient surge capacity by 8% (n = 100) as the bed occupancy increased exponentially from 30% to 88%. The start of evacuation of the facility until the endpoint of the surge marks the most dynamic phase of establishing a COVID facility during a pandemic. Pre-event planning for surge capacity at the inception of such pandemics should be based on the local and regional policies which depend on the competing demands of resources to maintain sustainability. These logistical demands are dynamic and vary as the pandemic progresses through its phases.","Niharika, Dhiman Sethi C. A.; Sangeeta, Gupta Krishna Agarwal Pandey N. B.; Rathore, A.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Subacute unit of a Rehabilitation Institute. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with COVID-19 (N=184; aged 18 years or older) who were admitted to a subacute unit to stabilize their condition and recover from acute respiratory failure due to COVID-19. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: At admission patients underwent the SPPB test, represented by the sum of 3 functional tests, standing balance, 4-meter gait speed, and 5-repetition sit-to-stand motion. Comparisons between 2 SPPB score groups were performed by an unpaired t test; multivariate stepwise linear regression analysis was employed to detect predictors of the SPPB score considering several clinical parameters. RESULTS: Participants were 74±12 years old, 52% were men and with more than 2 comorbidities in 43% of cases. SPPB score was 3.02±3.87 denoting patients' profound physical dysfunction. Normal physical function was detected in only 12% of patients, whereas low, intermediate, and severe impairment was found in 65%, 13%, and 10%, respectively. Age, both invasive and noninvasive ventilation use, and the presence of previous disability were significant predictors of SPPB. Patients without any comorbidities (8%) also exhibited low function (SPPB: 5.67±1.12). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of survivors after COVID-19 experienced acute respiratory failure due to pneumonia and exhibited substantial physical dysfunction influenced by age, mechanical ventilation need, and previous disability. Further studies are needed to evaluate the role of rehabilitation to promote recovery and community reintegration in this population.","Paneroni, Mara; Vogiatzis, Ioannis; Bertacchini, Laura; Simonelli, Carla; Vitacca, Michele",Arch Phys Med Rehabil,,210

In this study, we aimed to examine the effects risk factors in hypertensive Korean COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We selected patients from the database of the project #OpenData4Covid19. This information was linked to their 3-year historical healthcare data. The severity of the disease was classified into five levels. We also clustered the levels into two grades. RESULTS: The risk factors associated with COVID-19 severity were old age, diabetes mellitus, cerebrovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), malignancy, and renal replacement therapy. The use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) both before and after a diagnosis of COVID-19 were not associated with COVID-19 severity. A multivariate analysis revealed that old age, male sex, diabetes mellitus, and renal replacement therapy were risk factors for severe COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that in hypertensive patients with COVID-19, older age, male sex, a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, and renal replacement therapy were risk factors for a severe clinical course. In addition, the use of ARBs and ACEIs before or after COVID-19 infection did not affect a patient's risk of contracting COVID-19 nor did it contribute to a worse prognosis for the disease. These results highlighted that precautions should be considered for hypertensive patients with those risk factors and do not support discontinuation of ARBs and ACEIs during COVID-19 pandemic.","Kim, Hee-Sung; Kang, Minseok; Kang, Gilwon",BMC Infect Dis,,210
502453,Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Dependent COVID19 Hospital Transfers,2021,"Introduction: Undocumented migrants are at high risk of adverse consequences during crises because of a lack of access to essential securities and sources of support. This study aims to describe the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the health and living circumstances of precarious migrants in Switzerland and to assess whether those undergoing legal status regularization fared better than undocumented migrants. Materials and methods: This cross-sectional mixed methods study was conducted during the COVID-19 lockdown in April-May 2020. Undocumented and recently regularized migrants taking part in an ongoing cohort study were asked to respond to an online questionnaire. A subsample was selected to undergo semi-directed phone interviews. Results: Overall, 117 of the 379 (30.9%) cohort study participants responded to the questionnaire. Seventeen interviews were conducted. Migrants faced cumulative and rapidly progressive difficulties in essential life domains. As a consequence, they showed high prevalence of exposure to COVID-19, poor mental health along with frequent avoidance of health care. Moreover, the loss of working hours and the related income overlapped with frequent food and housing insecurity. Around one participant in four had experienced hunger. Despite these unmet needs, half of the participants had not sought external assistance for reasons that differ by legal status. Both groups felt that seeking assistance might represent a threat for the renewal or a future application for a residency permit. While documented migrants were less severely affected in some domains by having accumulated more reserves previously, they also frequently renounced to sources of support. Conclusions: The cumulated difficulties faced by migrants in this period of crisis and their limited search for assistance highlight the need to implement trust-building strategies to bridge the access gap to sources of support along with policies protecting them against the rapid loss of income, the risk of losing their residency permit and the exposure to multi-fold insecurities.","Burton-Jeangros, Claudine; Duvoisin, Aline; Lachat, Sarah; Consoli, Liala; Fakhoury, Julien; Jackson, Yves",Front Public Health,,210

Their valuable time and effort may benefit from computer-based mining of a large volume of health science literature that is a treasure trove of information. In this paper, we have developed a graph-based model using abstracts of 10,683 scientific articles to find key information on three topics: transmission, drug types, and genome research related to coronavirus. A subgraph is built for each of the three topics to extract more topic-focused information. Within each subgraph, we use a betweenness centrality measurement to rank order the importance of keywords related to drugs, diseases, pathogens, hosts of pathogens, and biomolecules. The results reveal intriguing information about antiviral drugs (Chloroquine, Amantadine, Dexamethasone), pathogen-hosts (pigs, bats, macaque, cynomolgus), viral pathogens (zika, dengue, malaria, and several viruses in the coronaviridae virus family), and proteins and therapeutic mechanisms (oligonucleotide, interferon, glycoprotein) in connection with the core topic of coronavirus.

This regimen is currently highly prevalent in the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has brought about increased concern about how best to safely avoid brachial plexus injuries when caring for unconscious proned patients. METHODS: A review of the published literature on brachial plexus injuries secondary to proning ventilated patients was performed. This was combined with a review of available international critical care guidelines in order to produce a succinct set of guidelines to aid critical care departments in reducing brachial plexus injuries during these challenging times. DISCUSSION: There is no one manner in which prone positioning an unconscious patient can be made universally safe. This paper provides 6 key steps to reducing the incidence of brachial plexus injuries while proning and suggests a safe and sensible management and referral pathway for the conscious patient in which a brachial plexus injury is identified. CONCLUSION: There is in truth no completely safe position for every patient and certainly there will be anomalies in anatomy that will predispose certain individuals to nerve injury. Thus the injury rate cannot be reduced to zero but an understanding of the principles of protection will inform those undertaking positioning.,"Simpson, Ashley I; Vaghela, Kalpesh R; Brown, Hazel; Adams, Kate; Sinisi, Marco; Fox, Michael; Quick, Tom",J Intensive Care Med,,210

It spread all over the world and became a pandemic. In many individuals who had suffered SARS-COV-2 infection, cytokine storm starts through cytokine overproduction and leads to Acute Respiratory Syndrome (ARS), organ failure, and death. According to the obtained evidence, Vitamin D (VitD) enhances the ACE2/Ang(1-7)/MasR pathway activity, and it also reduces cytokine storms and the ARS risk. Therefore, VitD intake may be beneficial for patients with SARS-COV-2 infection exposed to cytokine storm but do not suffer hypotension. In the present review, we have explained the effects of VitD on the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) function and angiotensin-converting enzyme2 (ACE2) expression. Furthermore, we have reviewed the biochemical and immunological effects of VitD on immune function in the underlying diseases and its role in the COVID-19 pandemic.","Musavi, Hadis; Abazari, Omid; Barartabar, Zeinab; Kalaki-Jouybari, Fatemeh; Hemmati-Dinarvand, Mohsen; Esmaeili, Parisa; Mahjoub, Soleiman",Arch Physiol Biochem,,210

Particle removal efficiencies were compared among differing shapes of the discharge electrode, including varying horizontal and vertical distances between spiked edges, and varying the height of the discharge pin support. When the horizontal distance between spiked edges was increased to 36 mm, the vertical distance between spiked edges increased to 54 mm, and when the height of the discharge pin support was increased to 76 mm, the removal efficiency of PM10was maintained at approximately 60.0%. Furthermore, the removal efficiency of particles over 5 µm was about 80% or greater. When the flow rate was 4 m s–1, the gap between collection plates was 60 mm, and –14 kV was applied to the discharge electrode. The particle removal efficiency of the flat plate-type electrostatic precipitator was maintained when the horizontal and vertical distances between spiked edges and the height of the discharge pin support were below threshold levels. Those variables may be important factors for designing the shape of the discharge electrode. Therefore, when designing electrostatic precipitators with multiple channels, the discharge electrode weight and processing costs must be considered when determining the optimal horizontal and vertical distances between spiked edges and the height of discharge pin support.","Kim, Jin-Seon; Kim, Hak-Joon; Han, Bangwoo; Lee, Sangrin; Lee, Jinwoon; Moon, Sangchul; Kim, Yong-Jin",Aerosol Air Qual.

510403,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in pregnancy: 2 case reports on maternal and neonatal outcomes in Yichang city, Hubei Province, China",2020,"BACKGROUND: Approximately 20% of women suffer from postpartum depression (PPD). Due to barriers such as limited access to care, half of the women with PPD do not receive treatment. Therefore, it is critical to identify effective and scalable interventions. Traditional mindfulness programs have been effective in reducing depressive symptoms, however access remains a barrier. A self-paced mobile health (mHealth) mindfulness program may fit the lifestyle of busy mothers who are unable to attend in-person classes. However, little is known regarding the feasibility or efficacy of mHealth mindfulness interventions in postpartum women with depressive symptoms. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of an mHealth mindfulness intervention for postpartum women with moderate to moderately severe depressive symptoms. METHODS: We conducted a single-arm feasibility trial of an mHealth mindfulness intervention within Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), a large integrated health care system. Participants were identified through clinician referral and electronic health records via KPNC's universal perinatal depression screening program and recruited by the study team. Inclusion criteria included the following: English-speaking, up to 6 months postpartum with a Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) score of 10 to 19, and no regular mindfulness/meditation practice. Participants were asked to use a mindfulness app, Headspace, 10 to 20 min/day for 6 weeks. Baseline and postintervention surveys captured data on patient-reported outcomes (depression and stress symptoms, sleep quality, and mindfulness). Semistructured interviews captured acceptability. Retention and adherence were used to assess feasibility. RESULTS: Of the 115 women who were contacted and met the eligibility criteria or declined participation before eligibility assessment, 27 (23%) were enrolled. In addition, 70% (19/27) completed the study. The mean age of participants was 31 years (SD 5.2), 30% (8/27) were non-Hispanic White, and, on average, participants were 12.3 weeks postpartum (SD 5.7). Of the women who completed the study, 100% (19/19) used the Headspace app at least once, and nearly half (9/19, 47%) used the app on &#8805;50% of the days during the 6-week intervention period. Of the 16 participants who completed the postintervention interview, 69% (11/16) reported that they were very or extremely satisfied with the app. Interviews indicated that women appreciated the variety of meditations and felt that the program led to reduced anxiety and improved sleep. Significant improvements in pre- and postintervention scores were observed for depressive symptoms (PHQ-8: -3.8, P=.004), perceived stress (10-item Perceived Stress Scale: -6.0, P=.005), and sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index: -2.1, P=.02, indicating less sleep disturbance). Improvements in mindfulness were also significant (Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire-Short Form: 10.9, P=.01). CONCLUSIONS: An mHealth mindfulness intervention for postpartum women with moderate to moderately severe depressive symptoms is feasible and acceptable. An efficacy trial is warranted.","Avalos, Lyndsay A; Aghaee, Sara; Kurtovich, Elaine; Quesenberry, Charles; Nkemere, Linda; McGinnis, MegAnn K; Kubo, Ai",JMIR Ment Health,,210

Some individuals may have primary immunodeficiencies that predispose to severe infections caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Objective: To explore the presence of genetic variants associated with primary immunodeficiencies among young patients with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: Case series of pairs of brothers without medical history meeting the selection criteria of young (age <35 years) brother pairs admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to severe COVID-19. Four men from 2 unrelated families were admitted to the ICUs of 4 hospitals in the Netherlands between March 23 and April 12, 2020. The final date of follow-up was May 16, 2020. Available family members were included for genetic variant segregation analysis and as controls for functional experiments. Exposure: Severe COVID-19. Main Outcome and Measures: Results of rapid clinical whole-exome sequencing, performed to identify a potential monogenic cause. Subsequently, basic genetic and immunological tests were performed in primary immune cells isolated from the patients and family members to characterize any immune defects. Results: The 4 male patients had a mean age of 26 years (range, 21-32), with no history of major chronic disease. They were previously well before developing respiratory insufficiency due to severe COVID-19, requiring mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The mean duration of ventilatory support was 10 days (range, 9-11); the mean duration of ICU stay was 13 days (range, 10-16). One patient died. Rapid clinical whole-exome sequencing of the patients and segregation in available family members identified loss-of-function variants of the X-chromosomal TLR7. In members of family 1, a maternally inherited 4-nucleotide deletion was identified (c.2129_2132del; p.[Gln710Argfs*18]); the affected members of family 2 carried a missense variant (c.2383G>T; p.[Val795Phe]). In primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells from the patients, downstream type I interferon (IFN) signaling was transcriptionally downregulated, as measured by significantly decreased mRNA expression of IRF7, IFNB1, and ISG15 on stimulation with the TLR7 agonist imiquimod as compared with family members and controls. The production of IFN-Î³, a type II IFN, was decreased in patients in response to stimulation with imiquimod. Conclusions and Relevance: In this case series of 4 young male patients with severe COVID-19, rare putative loss-of-function variants of X-chromosomal TLR7 were identified that were associated with impaired type I and II IFN responses. These preliminary findings provide insights into the pathogenesis of COVID-19.","van der Made, Caspar I; Simons, Annet; Schuurs-Hoeijmakers, Janneke; van den Heuvel, Guus; Mantere, Tuomo; Kersten, Simone; van Deuren, Rosanne C; Steehouwer, Marloes; van Reijmersdal, Simon V; Jaeger, Martin; Hofste, Tom; Astuti, Galuh; Corominas Galbany, Jordi; van der Schoot, Vyne; van der Hoeven, Hans; Hagmolen Of Ten Have, Wanda; Klijn, Eva; van den Meer, Catrien; Fiddelaers, Jeroen; de Mast, Quirijn; Bleeker-Rovers, Chantal P; Joosten, Leo A B; Yntema, Helger G; Gilissen, Christian; Nelen, Marcel; van der Meer, Jos W M; Brunner, Han G; Netea, Mihai G; van de Veerdonk, Frank L; Hoischen, Alexander",JAMA,,210

511751,A Tale of Undiagnosed Coronavirus Disease 2019 and Continued Disabling Exertional Dyspnea in a Previously Healthy and Active Patient,2020,"BACKGROUND: Surgical site infections are a global patient safety concern. Due to lack of evidence on contamination, pre-set surgical goods are sometimes disposed of or re-sterilized, thus increasing costs, resource use, and environmental effects. AIM: To investigate time-dependent bacterial air contamination of covered and uncovered sterile goods in the operating room. METHODS: Blood agar plates (N = 1584) were used to detect bacterial air contamination of sterile fields on 48 occasions. Each time, three aerobe and three anaerobe plates were used as baseline to model the preparation time, and 60 (30 aerobe, 30 anaerobe) were used to model the time pending before operation; half of these were covered with sterile drapes and half remained uncovered. Plates were collected after 4, 8, 12, 16, and 24 h. FINDINGS: Mean time before contamination was 2.8 h (95% confidence interval: 2.1-3.4) in the uncovered group and 3.8 h (3.2-4.4) in the covered group (P = 0.005). The uncovered group had 98 colony-forming units (cfu) versus 20 in the covered group (P = 0.0001). Sixteen different micro-organisms were isolated, the most common being Cutibacterium acnes followed by Micrococcus luteus. Of 32 Staphylococcus cfu, 14 were antibiotic resistant, including one multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis. CONCLUSION: Protecting sterile fields from bacterial air contamination with sterile covers enhances the durability of sterile goods up to 24 h. Prolonged durability of sterile goods might benefit patient safety, since surgical sterile material could be prepared in advance for acute surgery, thereby enhancing quality of care and reducing both climate impact and costs.","Wistrand, C; Söderquist, B; Sundqvist, A-S",J Hosp Infect,,210

Bali as a tourism destinations and the TS as major incomes of its population is greatly impacted, causing many to be jobless among those involved in TS. This situation may give psychological impact causing anxiety disorder (AD). OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between severe anxiety disorder and other factors with COVID-19 disease severity. METHODS: This was cross-sectional study during March - November 2020. The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 was done by using RT-PCR from throat swabs, based on WHO's interim guidelines. AD was measured using self-reporting Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7). All participants underwent, history taking, physical examinations, blood routine examination and chest radiography. Association between severe AD and other factors with COVID-19 disease severity were analyzed. Chi-square test (bivariate) and Logistic regression (multivariate) with the precision value of 95% was done and p-value less than 5% was considered significant. RESULTS: Positive rate of Covid-19 patients was 43% (292 / 678). Among those 292 with Covid-19, 74 (25.3%) participants had severe disease. Multivariate analysis showed severe anxiety (OR 696.11;95%CI: 78.54 to 6169.98;p&lt;0.001), hypertension (OR 37.02;95%CI: 4.49 to 305.39;p=0.001) and neutrophyl lymphocyte ratio (NLR) less than 2.89 (OR 0.15;95%CI: 0.04 to 0.62;p=0.009). CONCLUSION: Severe anxiety, hypertension and NLR less than 2.89 are potential independent risk factors for severe infection of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19).","Suryana, K. K.; Widiana, R. I.

513409,Eleven faces of coronavirus disease 2019,2020,"BACKGROUND: Identification of reliable outcome predictors in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is of paramount importance for improving patient's management. METHODS: A systematic review of literature was conducted until 24 April 2020. From 6843 articles, 49 studies were selected for a pooled assessment; cumulative statistics for age and sex were retrieved in 587 790 and 602 234 cases. Two endpoints were defined: (a) a composite outcome including death, severe presentation, hospitalization in the intensive care unit (ICU) and/or mechanical ventilation; and (b) in-hospital mortality. We extracted numeric data on patients' characteristics and cases with adverse outcomes and employed inverse variance random-effects models to derive pooled estimates. RESULTS: We identified 18 and 12 factors associated with the composite endpoint and death, respectively. Among those, a history of CVD (odds ratio (OR) = 3.15, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) 2.26-4.41), acute cardiac (OR = 10.58, 5.00-22.40) or kidney (OR = 5.13, 1.78-14.83) injury, increased procalcitonin (OR = 4.8, 2.034-11.31) or D-dimer (OR = 3.7, 1.74-7.89), and thrombocytopenia (OR = 6.23, 1.031-37.67) conveyed the highest odds for the adverse composite endpoint. Advanced age, male sex, cardiovascular comorbidities, acute cardiac or kidney injury, lymphocytopenia and D-dimer conferred an increased risk of in-hospital death. With respect to the treatment of the acute phase, therapy with steroids was associated with the adverse composite endpoint (OR = 3.61, 95% CI 1.934-6.73), but not with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Advanced age, comorbidities, abnormal inflammatory and organ injury circulating biomarkers captured patients with an adverse clinical outcome. Clinical history and laboratory profile may then help identify patients with a higher risk of in-hospital mortality.","Figliozzi, Stefano; Masci, Pier Giorgio; Ahmadi, Navid; Tondi, Lara; Koutli, Evangelia; Aimo, Alberto; Stamatelopoulos, Kimon; Dimopoulos, Meletios-Athanasios; Caforio, Alida L P; Georgiopoulos, Georgios",Eur J Clin Invest,,210
513410,Eleven faces of coronavirus disease 2019,2020,"Feature based local attribution methods are amongst the most prevalent in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) literature. Going beyond standard correlation, recently, methods have been proposed that highlight what should be minimally sufficient to justify the classification of an input (viz. pertinent positives). While minimal sufficiency is an attractive property, the resulting explanations are often too sparse for a human to understand and evaluate the local behavior of the model, thus making it difficult to judge its overall quality. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel method called Path-Sufficient Explanations Method (PSEM) that outputs a sequence of sufficient explanations for a given input of strictly decreasing size (or value) -- from original input to a minimally sufficient explanation -- which can be thought to trace the local boundary of the model in a smooth manner, thus providing better intuition about the local model behavior for the specific input. We validate these claims, both qualitatively and quantitatively, with experiments that show the benefit of PSEM across all three modalities (image, tabular and text). A user study depicts the strength of the method in communicating the local behavior, where (many) users are able to correctly determine the prediction made by a model.","Luss, Ronny; Dhurandhar, Amit",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.06181v1.pdf,210

There are no data regarding SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among liver transplant (LT) recipients, and whether it is different from that of the general population or other immunosuppressed groups. We evaluated the prevalence of IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among LT recipients to estimate the frequency of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection using serological assays in our outpatient clinic. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis from 10 May to 26 October 2020 of all adult (>18 years) LT recipients that underwent a routine laboratory test for the outpatient clinic follow-up at the Hospital Universitari Vall d'Hebron (Barcelona) in which we included serological testing for SARS-CoV-2. Nine out of 294 LT recipients (3.1%) tested positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. Five of them (55.5%) had suffered clinically symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by RT-PCR, four (44.4%) had presented compatible symptoms but without microbiological confirmation and only one patient (1/9, 11.1%) tested positive without any previous symptom. SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among LT recipients in an area highly affected by the pandemic is lower than in the general population in the same area. These results render the possibility of asymptomatic infection in LT recipients very unlikely.","Campos-Varela, Isabel; Len, Oscar; Villagrasa, Ares; Márquez-Algaba, Ester; Esperalba, Juliana; Dopazo, Cristina; Los-Arcos, Ibai; Antón, Andrés; Castells, Lluís",Transplant. int,,210

However, few studies have followed-up participants as the pandemic evolved and examined both between and within person predictors of symptom trajectories. In the current study, adolescents and young adults (N=532) in New York were surveyed monthly between March 27th and July 14th, 2020, a period spanning the first peak and subsequent decline in COVID-19 infection rates in the region. Surveys assessed symptoms of depression and anxiety using the Child Depression Inventory and the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders, as well as experiences related to the pandemic. Multilevel growth modeling indicated that symptoms of depression and anxiety peaked around late April/early May and then decreased through May-July. Some pandemic experiences followed a similar quadratic trajectory, while others decreased linearly across the study. Specific relationships emerged between some types of pandemic experiences and depression and anxiety symptoms. While symptoms of depression and anxiety in youth may have been elevated early in the pandemic, these findings suggest they subsided across Spring-Summer of 2020, with higher levels of both corresponding to a period of peak infection rates and decreases paralleling the decline in pandemic experiences and COVID-19 infection rates.","Hawes, Mariah T; Szenczy, Aline K; Olino, Thomas M; Nelson, Brady D; Klein, Daniel N",Psychiatry Res,,210

We aimed to assess the psychological impact of this outbreak on nurses in the hospitals of Guilan University of Medical Sciences that is one of the top provinces of incidence of COVID-19. Methods: In a web-based cross-sectional study, 441 nurses working were selected from the hospitals, from 7 to 12 April 2020. Anxiety and depression were measured using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, respectively. Simple and multiple logistic regression models were used to identify the factors related to anxiety and depression. Results: The majority were in contact with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases (93.4%) and their relatives had been infected with COVID-19 (42%). The mean of anxiety-7 and depression total scores were 8.64 ± 5.60 and 8.48 ± 6.19, respectively. Female (OR = 3.27, 95% CI = 1.01-10.64), working in COVID-19 designated hospital (OR = 1.82, 95% CI = 1.13-2.93), being suspected with COVID-19 infection (OR = 2.01, 95% CI = 1.25-3.26), and insufficient personal protective equipment (OR = 2.61, 95% CI = 1.68-4.06) were associated with anxiety. Depression was significantly associated with female sex (OR = 4.62, %95 CI = 1.24-17.16), having chronic disease (OR = 2.12, 95% CI = 1.20-3.74), being suspected or confirmed with COVID-19 infection (OR = 3.44, 95% CI = 2.11-5.59, and OR = 2.21, 95% CI = 1.04-4.70, respectively), and insufficient personal protective equipment (OR = 1.86, 95% CI = 1.19-2.91). Conclusion: The finding declares healthcare workers are at high risk for mental illness. Continuous supervision of the psychological consequences following infectious diseases outbreaks should be a part of the preparedness efforts of health care systems.","Pouralizadeh, Moluk; Bostani, Zahra; Maroufizadeh, Saman; Ghanbari, Atefeh; Khoshbakht, Maryam; Alavi, Seyed Amirhossein; Ashrafi, Sadra",Int J Afr Nurs Sci,,210

521321,Immediate Impact of Coronavirus Disease 2019 on Electroconvulsive Therapy Practice,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Value of chest CT was mainly studied in area of high COVID-19 incidence. The aim of this study was therefore to evaluate chest CT performances to diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia with regard to RT-PCR as reference standard in a low incidence area. METHODS: A survey was sent to radiology department in 4 hospitals in an administrative French region of weak disease prevalence (3.4%). Study design was approved by the local institutional review board and recorded on the clinicaltrial.gov website (NCT04339686). Written informed consent was waived due to retrospective anonymized data collection. Patients who underwent a RT-PCR and a chest CT scan within 48 h for COVID-19 pneumonia suspicion were consecutively included. Diagnostic accuracy including the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of chest CT regarding RT-PCR as reference standard were calculated. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-nine patients had abnormal chest CT findings compatible with a COVID-19 pneumonia (26%, 129/487). Among the 358 negative chest CT findings, 3% (10/358) were RT-PCR positive. Chest CT sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive value were respectively 87% (IC95: 85, 89; 69/79), 85% (IC95: 83, 87; 348/408), 53% (IC95: 50, 56; 69/129), and 97% (IC95: 95, 99; 348/358). CONCLUSIONS: In a low prevalence area, chest CT scan is a good diagnostic tool to rule out COVID-19 infection among symptomatic suspected patients. KEY POINTS: â¢ In a low prevalence area (3.4% in the administrative area and 5.8% at mean in the study) chest CT sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing COVID-19 pneumonia were 87% and 85% respectively. â¢ In patients with negative chest CT for COVID-19 pneumonia, the negative predictive value of COVID-19 infection was 97% (348/358 subjects). â¢ Performance of CT was equivalent between the 4 centers participating to this study.","Thomas, Clément; Naudin, Mathieu; Tasu, Jean-Pierre; Leclerc, Charles; Depaire, Lucas; Subervillle, Marie; Vionnet, Mathilde; Guillevin, Rémy; Herpe, Guillaume",Eur. radiol,,210

METHODS: Retrospective study considering the modifications on the Pediatric Surgery Residency training from March 1st–May 31st, 2020. Exposure to OR learning opportunities was compared to the same 2018–2019 trimesters. An anonymous survey about self-perception on surgical skills development was also performed. RESULTS: Residents performed 209 procedures as leading surgeons during the 2020 trimester with a mean number of surgeries per resident of 20.9, representing a reduction of 46% and 56.8% compared to the 2018–2019 averages, respectively. Reduction in both the number and the percentage of total procedures (n: 209, 56.8%) compared to both 2019 (n: 354, 68.7%, p: 0.000272) and 2018 (n: 420, 76.1%, p < 0,00,001) showed statistical correlation with no changes in their complexity pattern. From the survey (response rate: 100%), hours dedicated to simulation-based training were highly increased. More time was spent studying, but only 60% achieved better preparation for surgery and 70% perceived a decrease in surgical confidence. CONCLUSIONS: Even though the pandemic promoted new teaching strategies and the use of simulation-based training, it drastically reduced “on-the-job” learning opportunities with potential effects on residents’ performance and self-confidence during surgery.

591824,The most compatible position of operator and patient for nasopharyngeal swab procedure for coronavirus disease in rural setup,2021-04-01,"BACKGROUND: Paramyxoviruses include respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), and human metapneumovirus (MPV), which may cause significant respiratory tract infectious disease (RTID) and mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). However, clinical data regarding frequency and outcome are scarce. METHODS: We identified all paramyxovirus RTIDs in allogeneic HCT recipients diagnosed by multiplex polymerase chain reaction between 2010 and 2014. Baseline characteristics of patients, treatment, and outcome of each episode were analyzed; ie, moderate, severe, and very severe immunodeficiency (verySID) according to HCT ≤6 months, T- or B-cell depletion ≤3 months, graft-versus-host disease, neutropenia, lymphopenia, or hypo-gammaglobulinemia. RESULTS: One hundred three RTID episodes in 66 patients were identified (PIV 47% [48 of 103], RSV 32% [33 of 103], MPV 21% [22 of 103]). Episodes occurred in 85% (87 of 103) at >100 days post-HCT. Lower RTID accounted for 36% (37 of 103). Thirty-nine percent (40 of 103) of RTID episodes required hospitalization and more frequently affected patients with lower RTID. Six percent progressed from upper to lower RTID. Overall mortality was 6% and did not differ between paramyxoviruses. Sixty-one percent (63 of 103) of episodes occurred in patients with SID, and 20.2% (19 of 63) of episodes occurred in patients with verySID. Oral ribavirin plus intravenous immunoglobulin was administered in 38% (39 of 103) of RTIDs, preferably for RSV or MPV (P ≤ .001) and for SID patients (P = .001). Patients with verySID frequently progressed to lower RTID (P = .075), required intensive care unit transfer, and showed higher mortality. CONCLUSION: Paramyxovirus RTID remains a major concern in allogeneic HCT patients fulfilling SID and verySID, emphasizing that efficacious and safe antiviral treatments are urgently needed.","Spahr, Yasmin; Tschudin-Sutter, Sarah; Baettig, Veronika; Compagno, Francesca; Tamm, Michael; Halter, Jörg; Gerull, Sabine; Passweg, Jakob; Hirsch, Hans H; Khanna, Nina",Open Forum Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29780847/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofy077,210
591874,Chest CT Findings in Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 and Its Relationship With Clinical Features,2020-02-21,"The acute phase reaction (APR) is a response to potentially pathogenic stimuli. It begins with the release of interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α from inflammatory cells. These cytokines induce fever, leucocytosis and release of serum acute phase proteins (APPs). In this review, the characteristics of the feline APR are described. In cats with inflammatory conditions, fever is a common finding, with leucocytosis due to the release of cells from the marginal pool, followed by activation of myelopoiesis. Because excitement frequently causes leucocytosis in cats, a diagnosis of inflammation should therefore be supported by additional findings such as the presence of toxic neutrophils. The major APPs are serum amyloid A and α(1)-acid glycoprotein (AGP), which both increase a few hours after the inflammatory stimulus and remain elevated for as long as the inflammation persists. AGP plays an important role in the diagnosis of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) and may also be useful also in studies of FIP pathogenesis.","Paltrinieri, Saverio",Vet J,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1090023307002110; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17686640/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090023307002110,210

The dithiocarbamate acted as bidentate chelating ligands to afford a tetrahedral complexes with Co(II) ion and square planner with other transition metal ions. The dithiocarbamate complexes showed good activity against the pathogen bacteria species. The results showed the Pt‐dithiocarbamate complexes are more active against all the tested bacteria than the Pd‐dithiocarbamate complex. The dithiocarbamate complexes displayed the maximum inhibition zone against E. coli bacteria, whereas the lowest activity of the dithiocarbamate against Salmonella typhimurium bacteria. The cytotoxicity of the Pd(II) and Pt(II) complexes was screened against the MCF‐7 breast cancer cell line and the complexes showed moderate activity compared with the cis‐platin. The results indicated that the MCF7 cells treated with 500 μg\ml of ligands and Pd(II) and Pt(II) complexes after 24 hr exposure showed intercellular space and dead cells.

595070,Performance of Radiologists in the Evaluation of the Chest Radiography with the Use of a “new software score” in Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pneumonia Suspected Patients,2020-07-20,"BACKGROUND: Rare diseases are chronic and life-threatening disorders affecting < 1 person every 2,000. For most of them, clinical symptoms and signs can be observed at birth or childhood. Approximately 80% of all rare diseases have a genetic background and most of them are monogenic conditions. In addition, while the majority of these diseases is still incurable, early diagnosis and specific treatment can improve patients’ quality of life. Transplantation is among the therapeutic options and represents the definitive treatment for end-stage organ failure, both in children and adults. The aim of this paper was to analyze, in a large cohort of Italian patients, the main rare genetic diseases that led to organ transplantation, specifically pointing the attention on the pediatric cohort. RESULTS: To the purpose of our analysis, we considered heart, lung, liver and kidney transplants included in the Transplant Registry (TR) of the Italian National Transplantation Center in the 2002–2019 timeframe. Overall, 49,404 recipients were enrolled in the cohort, 5.1% of whom in the pediatric age. For 40,909 (82.8%) transplant recipients, a disease diagnosis was available, of which 38,615 in the adult cohort, while 8,495 patients (17.2%) were undiagnosed. There were 128 disease categories, and of these, 117 were listed in the main rare disease databases. In the pediatric cohort, 2,294 (5.6%) patients had a disease diagnosis: of the 2,126 (92.7%) patients affected by a rare disease, 1,402 (61.1%) presented with a monogenic condition. As expected, the frequencies of pathologies leading to organ failure were different between the pediatric and the adult cohort. Moreover, the pediatric group was characterized, compared to the adult one, by an overall better survival of the graft at ten years after transplant, with the only exception of lung transplants. When comparing survival considering rare vs non-rare diseases or rare and monogenic vs rare non-monogenic conditions, no differences were highlighted for kidney and lung transplants, while rare diseases had a better survival in liver as opposed to heart transplants. CONCLUSIONS: This work represents the first national survey analyzing the main genetic causes and frequencies of rare and/or monogenic diseases leading to organ failure and requiring transplantation both in adults and children.

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that a machine learning approach incorporating hidden nonlinear interactions can improve prediction for Intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Methods: Consecutive patients admitted to public hospitals between 1st January and 24th May 2020 in Hong Kong with COVID-19 diagnosed by RT-PCR were included. The primary endpoint was ICU admission. Results: This study included 1043 patients (median age 35 (IQR: 32-37; 54% male). Nineteen patients were admitted to ICU (median hospital length of stay (LOS): 30 days, median ICU LOS: 16 days). ICU patients were more likely to be prescribed angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, anti-retroviral drugs lopinavir/ritonavir and remdesivir, ribavirin, steroids, interferon-beta and hydroxychloroquine. Significant predictors of ICU admission were older age, male sex, prior coronary artery disease, respiratory diseases, diabetes, hypertension and chronic kidney disease, and activated partial thromboplastin time, red cell count, white cell count, albumin and serum sodium. A tree-based machine learning model identified most informative characteristics and hidden interactions that can predict ICU admission. These were: low red cells with 1) male, 2) older age, 3) low albumin, 4) low sodium or 5) prolonged APTT. A five-fold cross validation confirms superior performance of this model over baseline models including XGBoost, LightGBM, random forests, and multivariate logistic regression. Conclusions: A machine learning model including baseline risk factors and their hidden interactions can accurately predict ICU admission in COVID-19.","Zhou, J.; Tse, G.; Lee, S.; Liu, T.; Wu, W.

However, clinical characteristics of HPIV coinfection with other pathogens were unclear. This study aimed to investigate the viral and atypical bacterial etiology of LRTI in children and compare the clinical characteristics of HPIV single infection with those of coinfection. METHODS: This study included 1335 patients, aged between 1 to 71 months, diagnosed with LRTI in Yuying Children's Hospital, Zhejiang, China, from December 2013 to June 2015. Nasopharyngeal secretions were collected, and respiratory pathogens were detected using Multiplex polymerase chain reaction. The clinical data of patients were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: At least 1 pathogen was detected in 1181/1335 (88.5%) patients. The pathogens identified most frequently were respiratory syncytial virus, human rhinovirus, HPIV, adenovirus, and human metapneumovirus. The coinfection rate was 24.8%. HPIV coinfection with other viruses was more associated with running nose, shortness of breath, and oxygen support compared with HPIV single infection. Moreover, HPIV coinfection with atypical bacteria was more related to running nose, moist rales, and longer hospital duration compared with HPIV single infection, and also to longer hospital duration compared with coinfection with other viruses. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that viral infections were highly associated with LRTI and the rate of coinfection was high. HPIV single infection was milder than coinfection with other viruses. Moreover, HPIV coinfection with atypical bacteria was more serious than HPIV single infection and coinfection with other viruses.","Zhong, Peipei; Zhang, Hailin; Chen, Xiaofang; Lv, Fangfang",J Med Virol,https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.25499; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31066075/,210

As their state of preparation and perceptions in volunteering during this pandemic have yet to be investigated, this study aims to evaluate Indonesian medical students’ willingness to volunteer and readiness to practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A web-based survey was conducted among undergraduate medical students throughout Indonesia. Socio-demographic and social interaction information, in addition to willingness to volunteer and readiness to practice, were obtained using a self-reported questionnaire. The significance level was set at 5%. RESULTS: Among 4870 participants, 2374 (48.7%) expressed their willingness to volunteer, while only 906 (18.6%) had adequate readiness to practice. Male students, students with prior volunteering experience in health or non-health sectors, and students from public universities or living in Central Indonesia (vs Java) had higher scores of willingness and readiness to volunteer. Students from Sumatra also had better preparedness (odds ratio [OR] 1.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.15–2.12, p = 0.004), while the opposite occurred for students from Eastern Indonesia (OR 0.63, 95% CI: 0.44–0.89, p = 0.002)–when compared to students from Java. In addition, compared to students with high family income, students from lower-middle income families were less willing to volunteer (OR 0.76, 95% CI: 0.59–0.98, p = 0.034), though those with low family income had better readiness (OR 1.51, 95% CI: 1.10–2.08, p = 0.011). Shortage of medical personnel, sense of duty, and solicitation by stakeholders were the main reasons increasing the students’ willingness to volunteer; whereas contrarily fear for own’s health, absence of a cure, and fear of harming patients were the primary factors diminishing their willingness to volunteer. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicated that many Indonesian medical students are willing to volunteer, yet only few of them were ready to practice, indicating that further preparations are required to maximize their potentials and minimize their exposure to hazards. We suggest that their potentials as a firm support system during the pandemic should not be overlooked, and that the integration of relevant courses to the medical curricula are imperative to prepare for future public health emergencies.","Lazarus, Gilbert; Findyartini, Ardi; Putera, Azis Muhammad; Gamalliel, Nico; Nugraha, David; Adli, Imam; Phowira, Jason; Azzahra, Lyanna; Ariffandi, Bagas; Widyahening, Indah Suci",BMC Med Educ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33648516/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-021-02576-0,210

602924,Epidemiological Trends of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China,2020-03-17,"Background and study aims Infection control is essential when performing endoscopic procedures, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, we have developed a new shielding device called STEP for infection control in upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Patients and methods STEP consists of a mask worn by the patient and a drape that is connected to the mask and covers the endoscope. A suction tube attached to the mask prevents aerosols from spreading. The endoscopist operates the endoscope through the drape. Three endoscopists performed a total of 18 examinations using an upper endoscopy training model with and without STEP. Endoscopic images were evaluated by three other endoscopists, using a visual analog scale. We also simulated contact, droplet, and aerosol infection and evaluated the utility of STEP. Results All examinations were conducted without a problem. Mean procedure time was 126.3 ± 11.6 seconds with STEP and 122.3 ± 10.0 seconds without STEP. The mean visual analog score was 90.7 ± 10.1 with STEP and 90.4 ± 10.0 without STEP. In the contact model, adherence of simulated contaminants was 4.9 ± 1.4 % without STEP and 0 % with STEP. In the droplet model, the number of simulated contaminants attached to the paper was 338 273 ± 90 735 pixels without STEP and 0 with STEP. In the aerosol model, the total number of particles was 346 837 ± 9485 without STEP and was significantly reduced to 222 ± 174 with STEP. Conclusions No effect on examination time or endoscopic image quality was observed when using STEP in upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Using STEP reduced the diffusion of simulated contaminants in all three infection models.","Kikuchi, Daisuke; Ariyoshi, Daiki; Suzuki, Yugo; Ochiai, Yorinari; Odagiri, Hiroyuki; Hayasaka, Junnosuke; Tanaka, Masami; Morishima, Tetsuya; Kimura, Keita; Ezawa, Hiroshi; Iwamoto, Risa; Matsuwaki, Yoshinori; Hoteya, Shu",Endosc Int Open,https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1523-8959; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34540547/,210

Here, we neurophysiologically assessed the presence of either critical illness neuropathy (CIP) or myopathy (CIM) in ICU patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients underwent a neurophysiological assessment, including bilateral examination of the median, ulnar, deep peroneal and tibial motor nerves and of the median, ulnar, radial and sural sensory nerves. Needle electromyography (EMG) was performed for both distal and proximal muscles of the lower and upper limbs. In order to differentiate CIP from CIM, Direct Muscle Stimulation (DMS) was applied either to the deltoid or tibialis anterior muscles. Peak to peak amplitudes and onset latencies of the responses evoked by DMS (DMS(amp), DMS(lat)) or by motor nerve stimulation (MNS(amp), MNS(lat)) were compared. The ratio MNS(amp) to DMS(amp) (NMR) and the MNS(lat) to DMS(lat) difference (NMD: MNS(lat) − DMS(lat)) were also evaluated. RESULTS: Nerve conduction studies showed a sensory-motor polyneuropathy with axonal neurogenic pattern, as confirmed by needle EMG. Both MNS(amp) and NMR were significantly reduced when compared to controls (p < 0.0001), whereas MNS(lat) and NMD were markedly increased (p = 0.0049). CONCLUSIONS: We have described COVID patients in the ICU with critical illness neuropathy (CIP). COVID-related CIP could have implications for the functional recovery and rehabilitation strategies.","Bocci, Tommaso; Campiglio, Laura; Zardoni, Manuela; Botta, Stefano; Coppola, Silvia; Groppo, Elisabetta; Chiumello, Davide; Priori, Alberto",Neurol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34477990/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10072-021-05471-0,210

Initial crystallization screening is based on nanolitre‐scale sitting‐drop vapour‐diffusion experiments (typically 100 nl of protein plus 100 nl of reservoir solution per droplet) which use standard crystallization screening kits and 96‐well crystallization plates. For 294 K crystallization trials the barcoded crystallization plates are entered into an automated storage system with a fully integrated imaging system. These plates are imaged in accordance with a pre‐programmed schedule and the resulting digital data for each droplet are harvested into a laboratory information‐management system (LIMS), scored by crystal recognition software and displayed for user analysis via a web‐based interface. Currently, storage for trials at 277 K is not automated and for imaging the crystallization plates are fed by hand into an imaging system from which the data enter the LIMS.

Over the counter antipyretics such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen are often taken by individuals to reduce the discomfort of fever. Recently, the safety of ibuprofen in COVID-19 patients has been questioned due to anecdotal reports of worsening symptoms in previously healthy young adults. Studies show that ibuprofen demonstrates superior efficacy in fever reduction compared to acetaminophen. As fever may have benefit in shortening the duration of viral illness, it is plausible to hypothesize that the antipyretic efficacy of ibuprofen may be hindering the benefits of a fever response when taken during the early stages of COVID-19 illness.","Jamerson, Brenda; Ho Haryadi, T.",Med Hypotheses,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987720309488?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109880; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32505846/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306987720309488,210

The present study was conducted to better understand the effects of GB on immune responses in a mouse model, and to demonstrate the clearance effects of this mineral against Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) in experimentally infected pigs as an initial step towards the development of a feed supplement that would promote immune activity and help prevent diseases. In the mouse model, dietary supplementation with GB enhanced concanavalin A (ConA)-induced lymphocyte proliferation and increased the percentage of CD3+CD8+ T lymphocytes. In pigs experimentally infected with PRRSV, viral titers in lungs and lymphoid tissues from the GB-fed group were significantly decreased compared to those of the control group 12 days post-infection. Corresponding histopathological analyses demonstrated that GB-fed pigs displayed less severe pathological changes associated with PRRSV infection compared to the control group, indicating that GB promotes PRRSV clearance. These antiviral effects in pigs may be related to the ability of GB to increase CD3+CD8+ T lymphocyte production observed in the mice. Hence, this mineral may be an effective feed supplement for increasing immune activity and preventing disease.","Jung, Bock-Gie; Lee, Jin-A; Lee, Bong-Joo",J Vet Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23814470/; https://doi.org/10.4142/jvs.2013.14.2.135,210

COVID-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Reproductive health has always been one of the most important healthcare problems, and the impacts of COVID-19 on the reproductive systems have become an emerging topic. The effects of infection with SARS-CoV-2 on males are more harmful than on females. The outcomes of pregnancy also can show the condition of male and female reproductive system health. The vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 significantly affects pregnancy healthy. SARS-CoV-2, antibody, and other factors, such as the decline of lymphocyte counts, and increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and D-dimer levels, are evidence of SARS-CoV-2 vertical transmission. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is regarded as a virus receptor in the reproductive system. The expression and activity of ACE2 are influenced by sex hormones, especially the male sex hormones. The strength of immunity is crucial to fighting off viral infection. Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 show different expression in male and female patients, and the antibodies have been regarded as having potential applications in COVID-19 prevention and treatment. This review aims to present the current status of what is known about the involvement of the male and female reproductive systems, as well as the effects on pregnancy health, during infection with SARS-CoV-2, and discusses the implications for future fertility.","Liu, Chunlian; Mu, Chunlan; Zhang, Qian; Yang, Xiwen; Yan, Hui; Jiao, Haiyan",Med Sci Monit,https://doi.org/10.12659/msm.930168; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34193809/,210

607633,Smell and taste recovery in coronavirus disease 2019 patients: a 60-day objective and prospective study,2020-08-12,"Assessing the risk of infection from emerging viruses or of existing viruses jumping the species barrier into novel hosts is limited by the lack of dose response data. The initial stages of the infection of a host by a virus involve a series of specific contact interactions between molecules in the host and on the virus surface. The strength of the interaction is quantified in the literature by the dissociation constant (K(d)) which is determined experimentally and is specific for a given virus molecule/host molecule combination. Here, two stages of the initial infection process of host intestinal cells are modelled, namely escape of the virus in the oral challenge dose from the innate host defenses (e.g. mucin proteins in mucus) and the subsequent binding of any surviving virus to receptor molecules on the surface of the host epithelial cells. The strength of virus binding to host cells and to mucins may be quantified by the association constants, K(a) and K(mucin), respectively. Here, a mechanistic dose-response model for the probability of infection of a host by a given virus dose is constructed using K(a) and K(mucin) which may be derived from published K(d) values taking into account the number of specific molecular interactions. It is shown that the effectiveness of the mucus barrier is determined not only by the amount of mucin but also by the magnitude of K(mucin). At very high K(mucin) values, slight excesses of mucin over virus are sufficient to remove all the virus according to the model. At lower K(mucin) values, high numbers of virus may escape even with large excesses of mucin. The output from the mechanistic model is the probability (p(1)) of infection by a single virion which is the parameter used in conventional dose-response models to predict the risk of infection of the host from the ingested dose. It is shown here how differences in K(a) (due to molecular differences in an emerging virus strain or new host) affect p(1), and how these differences in K(a) may be quantified in terms of two thermodynamic parameters, namely enthalpy and entropy. This provides the theoretical link between sequencing data and risk of infection. Lack of data on entropy is a limitation at present and may also affect our interpretation of K(d) in terms of infectivity. It is concluded that thermodynamic approaches have a major contribution to make in developing dose-response models for emerging viruses.","Gale, Paul",Microb Risk Anal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32289059/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352352217301561; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mran.2018.01.002; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352352217301561,210

Hence, the concept of a circular economy for plastics has been proposed as a sustainable approach to thrive both economy and our modern life. To implement a circular economy for plastics, an understanding of both individuals’ and organizations’ behaviors is needed since psychological effects often undermine technical solutions. We particularly focus on organizations’ behaviors since commercial plastic waste has not been thoroughly investigated compared to household plastic waste. Using the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM), we assess the determinants of intentions and behaviors of 637 organizations in Belgium towards a circular economy for plastics. Our PLS-SEM analysis support that attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control of decision makers positively influence organizations’ intentions to implement best practices of plastic recycling. Furthermore, organizations’ intentions, perceived behavioral control, pressures, and enablers positively, whereas barriers negatively, influence organizations’ behaviors. Our study shows that most organizations have positive intentions, yet they seem to be failing in implementing best practices of plastic recycling due to some critical barriers. To overcome this intention-behavior gap and to attain a circular economy for plastics, our study suggests some measures.","Khan, Owais; Daddi, Tiberio; Slabbinck, Hendrik; Kleinhans, Kerstin; Vazquez-Brust, Diego; De Meester, Steven",Resour Conserv Recycl,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344920303864; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32834488/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2020.105069; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0921344920303864,210

This study was carried out during the specialty training of the residents, who are currently family physicians fighting against COVID-19 in the field, and was aimed to identify the awareness levels of residents regarding the roles and duties of family physicians before, during, and after disasters and to increase their awareness of disaster medicine and management. BACKGROUND: The duties and responsibilities of a family physician in disasters should be a part of their specialty training. This study has contributed to the limited literature, increased awareness, and opened a new avenue of research for studies to be conducted with family physicians by demonstrating the current situation of family physicians in disaster management. METHODS: This is an observational and descriptive study. The knowledge, experience, opinions, willingness, attitudes of the residents, and the awareness levels of the residents regarding their roles and duties in a disaster were evaluated along with their sociodemographic information. The surveys were applied in the family medicine clinics of the all residents by the interview method (n = 233). FINDINGS: Only 9.2% of the residents stated that they had received training on disaster medicine where they currently work. The knowledge level of the residents on this subject was found as ‘Unsure’. In total, 80% of the residents stated that family physicians should have a role in disasters. It was found that 83.3% of the residents had never joined a disaster drill, 94.3% had never participated in making or applying a disaster plan, and 97.7% had never worked in any disaster. CONCLUSION: The residents participating in the study lacked not only information on disaster management but also experience. The residents’ willingness to receive training, work voluntarily, significantly question the curriculum, and specialize in disaster medicine were a positive outcome.","Yılmaz, Tarık Eren; Yılmaz, Tuğba; Örnek Büken, Nüket; Özkara, Adem; Altıntaş, Kerim Hakan",Prim Health Care Res Dev,https://doi.org/10.1017/s146342362000047x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33109285/,210

The most commonly deranged liver enzyme found was alanine transaminase (ALT), both in males (19.9%) and females (21.3%), followed by aspartate transaminase (male: 18.3% and female: 20.3%). Serum total bilirubin was deranged in both males (8.4%) and females (8.3%). There was no significant difference in the gender-wise prevalence of deranged liver enzymes. Conclusion Liver enzymes are frequently deranged in patients admitted with COVID-19. Liver enzymes should be regularly monitored during the course of management of COVID-19, as various medications used in the treatment of COVID-19 may further deteriorate liver enzymes and may cause long-term damage.","Naeem, Ammara; Khamuani, Manoj Kumar; Kumar, Pardeep; Pooja, FNU; Raj, Deepak; Lal, Kirshan; Shahid, Wajeeha; Mahar, Waseem; Rizwan, Amber; Fatima, Aliya",Cureus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34650842/; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.17650,210

Promoting preventive behaviour among the public is of paramount importance to effectively contain the disease. Hence, this research attempts to identify factors that affect preventive behaviour against COVID-19. METHODS: The Health Belief Model (HBM), which outlines how perceived susceptibility, severity, benefits, barriers, and health motivation affect individuals’ health behaviour, served as the theoretical basis of the study. As the outcome measure of the study was cues to action against COVID-19, a regression analysis was conducted to explore how the aforementioned HBM constructs influence the cues to action. The data were collected using an online survey with a total of 307 respondents. RESULTS: The results revealed that perceived benefits (0.395, p < 0.001), self-efficacy (0.405, p < 0.001), and general health motivation (0.313, p < 0.001) had significant positive impacts on the cues to action taken to prevent COVID-19, whereas perceived barriers (−0.097, p < 0.05) had a significant negative impact. The statistical analysis further revealed that the cues to action taken to prevent COVID-19 were not significantly influenced by perceived susceptibility and perceived severity. CONCLUSION: The study reinstates the usability of the HBM in exploring health behaviour. Importantly, the study findings suggest that by informing the public of the benefits of prevention and general health motivation, and by encouraging self-efficacy and eliminating the barriers to prevention, preventive actions against COVID-19 can be effectively promoted.","Mahindarathne, M.G.P.P.",J Taibah Univ Med Sci,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1658361221001438; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1658361221001438; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtumed.2021.07.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34393699/,210

Individualizing the management of patients while ensuring their safety and adherence to the study protocol, establishing specific staff contingency plans, and maintaining sponsor and contract research organization (CRO) alignment are some of the key issues for maintaining the continuity of cancer patients’ investigational treatment and minimizing their infection risk as well as the risk to staff members of the unit, sponsors, and CROs while maintaining the integrity of data quality and compliance with good clinical practice.","de Miguel, Maria; Doger, Bernard; Boni, Valentina; Hernández‐Guerrero, Tatiana; Moreno, Irene; Morillo, Daniel; Moreno, Victor; Calvo, Emiliano",Cancer,https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.32980; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32557596/,210
624503,The Epidemiology and Etiologies of Respiratory Tract Infection in Northern Taiwan During The Early Phase of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Outbreak,2021-06-22,"BACKGROUND: Scientists have demonstrated the efficacy of vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in randomized controlled trials. However, the extent to which reductions in COVID-19 case fatality ratio (CFR) are attributable to mass vaccination in the real world remains unclear. This study evaluated the association of COVID-19 vaccine coverage with CFR on a global scale. METHODS: The sample was a longitudinal data set of 90 countries over 25 weeks, from the first week of November 2020 to the third week of April 2021. CFR was measured in deaths per 100 COVID-19 confirmed cases; vaccine coverage was defined as the number of people who received at least one vaccine dose per 10 people in the total population. Data were retrieved from open-access databases, including Our World in Data and the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker. A country-level random effects model was used; a comprehensive set of variables for country characteristics and nonpharmaceutical interventions were included. RESULTS: A 10% increase in vaccine coverage was associated with a 7.6% reduction in the CFR (95% confidence interval (CI = -12.6 to -2.7%, P = 0.002). This association was stronger in countries with more effective governments (-8.3%; 95% CI = -13.6 to -3.1%, P = 0.002) and higher transport infrastructure quality (-8.1%; 95% CI = -13.3 to -2.9%, P = 0.002). Moreover, the vaccine coverage was associated with a reduced CFR in a dose-dependent manner. When vaccine coverage achieved 0.8 to 1.6, 1.6 to 3.2 and ≥3.2 per 10 people, the CFR reduced by 12.7% (95 CI = -21.8 to -3.6%, P = 0.006), 21.2% (95 CI = -33.9 to -8.5%, P = 0.001) and 31.3% (95 CI = -51.5 to -11.0%, P = 0.002), respectively as compared with no vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide supporting evidence that vaccination is critical to preventing deaths among infected people. Vaccination programmes have yielded significant health benefits in certain countries. However, globally, a large gap remains between observed and achievable fatality reductions. Continuous improvement in vaccine coverage will be critical to transforming efficacious vaccines into desired health outcomes.","Liang, Li-Lin; Kuo, Hsu-Sung; Ho, Hsiu J; Wu, Chun-Ying",Journal of global health,https://doi.org/10.7189/jogh.11.05019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34326999/,210

Notre objectif est de décrire l’impact de la première vague de COVID-19 sur la consommation en antifongiques systémiques (AF) en milieu hospitalier. Matériels et méthodes Une application dédiée a été développée pour recueillir les consommations AF exprimées en nombre de doses définies journalières pour 1000 journées d’hospitalisation (DDJ/1000 JH). La consommation totale de l’hôpital et en réanimation a été recueillie mensuellement pour les premiers semestres 2019 et 2020 (S1-2019 et S1-2020). Le nombre de patients COVID-19 hospitalisés au cours du premier semestre 2020 et le nombre de JH en réanimation étaient renseignés. Résultats Quarante-huit hôpitaux ont participé à cette étude (18 hôpitaux universitaires, 2 centres de lutte contre le cancer et 28 centres hospitaliers). Tous sauf un ont reçu des patients COVID-19 au cours du premier semestre 2020 (nombre moyen de patients 454 ; [0–2067]). La consommation totale AF était supérieure en 2020 comparée à 2019 (24,7 DDJ/1000 JH en 2019 versus 28,2 en 2020). Le nombre de JH en réanimation était supérieur durant S1-2020 avec 229 195 JH, comparé à 210 830 JH pour S1-2019. Cependant la consommation AF en réanimation a diminué (154,5 en 2019 vs 149,7 en 2020), notamment pour le fluconazole (56,6 en S1-2019 vs 47,8 en S1-2020) et l’amphotéricine B (41,4 vs 37,9), alors que la consommation a augmenté pour le voriconazole (15,2 à 18,3), posaconazole (3,4 à 4,6), isavuconazole (2,6 vs 3,3) et caspofungine (31,2 vs 35,4). Conclusion La consommation globale en ATF a augmenté dans cette enquête nationale entre S1-2019 et S1-2020, suggérant un impact de la pandémie COVID-19 sur la consommation hospitalière AF. Parallèlement à l’augmentation de l’activité en réanimation sur la même période, nous avons observé une augmentation de la consommation en AF anti-aspergillaires (azolés ciblés) et en échinocandines ; et une diminution de la consommation en fluconazole et en amphotéricine B. Il y a plusieurs biais possibles à cette étude, liés notamment à la difficulté à évaluer l’activité hospitalière et l’annulation des soins pendant la première vague de COVID-19. Cependant, ces données pourraient refléter une sensibilisation des prescripteurs, et notamment des réanimateurs, au risque accru d’IFI (aspergilloses pulmonaires invasives et candidémies) observé chez les patients COVID-19 hospitalisés en réanimation, ayant entraîné des prescriptions AF, soit pour un traitement curatif ciblé, soit pour un traitement empirique et/ou prophylactique.","Lieutier-Colas, F.; Jouzeau, A.; Chabaud, A.; Dumartin, C.; Péfau, M.; Botterel, F.; Alanio, A.; Ranque, S.; Gangneux, J.; Simon, L.",Infectious Diseases Now,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666991921003663; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666991921003663,210

Our aim was to identify risk factors for infection among health care workers to limit adverse events in health care facilities. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 336 HCWs from COVID-19 treatment hospitals took part in the study with varying COVID-19 exposure risk depending on job function and working site. All participants were asked about risk factors for COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: Among our participants, 42.6% were medical doctors, 28.6% nurses and 7.4% assistant nurses and 21.4% were others. Forty four percent of participants had work experience 5 – 10 years. More than half of participants received training in Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) (56.8%) about COVID 19; 91 % have hand hygiene facilities and 69 % admitted availability of PPE. More than half of participants admitted that they always follow IPC measures. Two thirds of participants (66.7%) had close contact with a patient since admission; 42.3 % were present in aerosolizing procedures for patients. Forty two percent of participants had respiratory symptom; the most common was sore throat representing (32.4%). The highest frequency of respiratory symptoms was among of nurses and assistant nurses 51 %. Frequency of respiratory symptoms was higher among those who contacted the patient directly or for prolonged period compared to those who don’t admitted these contacts. CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors for COVID-19 represented by those who were smokers, nurses and assistant nurses were more liable to catch COVID-19 than doctors as they contacted the patient directly for prolonged period or his/her body fluids, materials or surfaces around him.","Kishk, Rania M.; Nemr, Nader; Aly, Hebatalla M.; Soliman, Nourhan H.; Hagras, Abeer M.; Ahmed, Ali A.A.; Kishk, Safaa M.; Mostafa, Mona; Louis, Nageh",J Infect Public Health,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S187603412100191X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187603412100191X?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2021.07.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34281792/,210

Patients with cancer are at higher risk of severe COVID-19. We aimed to describe and compare the immunological features of cancer patients hospitalized for COVID-19 or other concomitant, cancer-related illness. METHODS: In this prospective study, the clinical and immunological characteristics of 11 cancer patients with COVID-19 and 11 non-COVID-19 cancer patients hospitalized in the same unit at the same period for other medical issues were analyzed. We also used 10 healthy volunteers as controls. Peripheral immune parameters were analyzed using multiparametric flow cytometry. RESULTS: The median age of COVID-19-positive cancer patients was 71.1 years, and 66.4 years for controls. Compared with non COVID-19 cancer patients, COVID-19 positive cancer patients had more extensive lymphopenia and hypoalbuminemia, with higher levels of C-reactive protein. In COVID-19 patients, elevated procalcitonin was associated with a higher risk of death. By phenotypic analysis, COVID-19 positive patients presented CD3 lymphopenia, with inversion of the CD4/CD8 ratio and modification of monocyte activation, with accumulation of mMDSC-like cells and a decrease in activated monocytes. Analysis of the T-cell compartment revealed a T-dependent inflammatory response with accumulation of Th17 cells and cytotoxic CD8 T cells producing TNFα, a decrease in HLA-DR positive CD8 T cells and Treg/CD8 ratio. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 infection in cancer patients is associated with CD4 T cell lymphopenia with induction of an inflammatory T-cell response, accumulation of IFNγ(+) TNFα(+) CD8 T and Th17 cells, and a concomitant modification of monocyte activation status.","Thibaudin, Marion; Fumet, Jean-David; Bon, Marjorie; Hampe, Léa; Limagne, Emeric; Ghiringhelli, Francois",Eur J Cancer,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959804920304640?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejca.2020.08.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32977223/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0959804920304640,210

631211,Coronavirus Disease 2019-Associated Bilateral Massive Pulmonary Emboli Caused Death in a Healthy 35-Year-Old Patient,2020-09-02,"Respiratory viruses cause disease in humans characterized by an abrupt onset of symptoms. Studies in humans and animal models have shown that symptoms are not immediate and appear days or even weeks after infection. Since the initial symptoms are a manifestation of virus recognition by elements of the innate immune response, early virus replication must go largely undetected. The interval between infection and the emergence of symptoms is called the incubation period and is widely used as a clinical score. While incubation periods have been described for many virus infections the underlying mechanism for this asymptomatic phase has not been comprehensively documented. Here we review studies of the interaction between human pathogenic respiratory RNA viruses and the host with a particular emphasis on the mechanisms used by viruses to inhibit immunity. We discuss the concept of the “stealth phase”, defined as the time between infection and the earliest detectable inflammatory response. We propose that the “stealth phase” phenomenon is primarily responsible for the suppression of symptoms during the incubation period and results from viral antagonism that inhibits major pathways of the innate immune system allowing an extended time of unhindered virus replication.","Hermesh, Tamar; Moltedo, Bruno; López, Carolina B.; Moran, Thomas M.",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21994630/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v2112541,210

The aim of this study was to identify the lincRNA profile in the dengue vector Aedes aegypti and evaluate their potential role in host-pathogen interaction. The majority of previous RNA-Seq transcriptome studies in Ae. aegypti have focused on the expression pattern of annotated protein coding genes under different biological conditions. Here, we used 35 publically available RNA-Seq datasets with relatively high depth to screen the Ae. aegypti genome for lincRNA discovery. This led to the identification of 3,482 putative lincRNAs. These lincRNA genes displayed a slightly lower GC content and shorter transcript lengths compared to protein-encoding genes. Ae. aegypti lincRNAs also demonstrate low evolutionary sequence conservation even among closely related species such as Culex quinquefasciatus and Anopheles gambiae. We examined their expression in dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) and Wolbachia infected and non-infected adult mosquitoes and Aa20 cells. The results revealed that DENV-2 infection increased the abundance of a number of host lincRNAs, from which some suppress viral replication in mosquito cells. RNAi-mediated silencing of lincRNA_1317 led to enhancement in viral replication, which possibly indicates its potential involvement in the host anti-viral defense. A number of lincRNAs were also differentially expressed in Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes. The results will facilitate future studies to unravel the function of lncRNAs in insects and may prove to be beneficial in developing new ways to control vectors or inhibit replication of viruses in them.","Etebari, Kayvan; Asad, Sultan; Zhang, Guangmei; Asgari, Sassan",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0005069; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27760142/,210

However, few reports have described a direct comparison between multiplex RT‐PCR assays for RV. The objective of this study was to perform a direct comparison of three multiplex RT‐PCR assays for the detection of respiratory viruses. METHODS: A total of 201 respiratory samples (161 nasopharyngeal swab samples and 40 sputum samples) were tested with three commercial RV assays: Seegene Anyplex II RV16 (AP), LG AdvanSure RV (AD), and Biosewoom Real‐Q RV (RQ). The additional tests for the discrepant results were conducted by repeat RV assay or monoplex PCR coupled direct sequencing. Data analysis using percent agreement, kappa, and prevalence‐adjusted and bias‐adjusted kappa (PABAK) values was performed for comparisons among the three RV assays. RESULTS: Of the 201 samples, AP, AD, and RQ detected 105 (52.2%), 99 (49.3%), and 95 (47.3%) positive cases respectively. The overall agreement, kappa, and PABAK values for the three assays ranged between 97%‐98%, 0.76‐0.86, and 0.93‐0.96 respectively. The performance of the three assays was very similar, with 94%‐100% agreement for all comparisons, each virus types. The additional testing of samples showed discrepant results demonstrating that AD assay had the highest rate of concordance with original results. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that all multiplex assay would be suitable for the detection of for respiratory viruses in clinical setting.","Yun, Seung Gyu; Kim, Min Young; Choi, Jong Moon; Lee, Chang Kyu; Lim, Chae Seung; Cho, Yunjung; Suh, In Bum",J Clin Lab Anal,https://doi.org/10.1002/jcla.22230; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28397965/,210
631733,Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019–Associated Great Vessel Aneurysmal Degeneration Through a Hybrid Approach,2021-10-31,"This paper examines critically the economic package announced by the Indian central government to counter the challenges of lives and livelihood in the Covid‐19 pandemic. This paper estimates the shares of the fiscal economic packages in two phases as per the shares of the vulnerable workers and number of Covid‐19 cases in the Indian states. The recent data on labour market are used from National Sample Survey Organization and data on Covid‐19 cases from Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. This paper recommends alternatively a fiscal stimulus package of Rs. 10 lakh crores (5% of GDP) with an immediate effect to counter the present problems of health, food and unemployment in the pandemic and should be extended to Rs. 24 lakh crores (12% of Indian GDP) to the Indian states for at least 1 year to protect the lives and livelihood of the most vulnerable, informal and migrant workers. The populous and poor states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar have higher share of vulnerable workers and highly industrialized states like Maharashtra, Gujarat, Delhi and Tamil Nadu have higher number of Covid‐19 cases. Due to the unplanned lockdown in India, there has been a surge in Covid‐19 cases across the country that in turn led to an increase in vulnerable workers in poor states due to reverse migration from industrialized states to populous and poor states during the pandemic. Furthermore, the paper explains the five significant factors that justify the adoption of an expansionary fiscal policy rather than monetary policy.","Thakur, Narender; Kumar, Manik; Vaishali,",J Public Aff,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33786022/; https://doi.org/10.1002/pa.2632,210

Improving public awareness about preventive measures and disseminating appropriate information about COVID-19 has a critical role in containing the disease. AIM: To evaluate and determine the factors that may affect the level of awareness and responses toward COVID-19 in Arab countries. The study could be helpful in identifying where more public education about COVID-19 is needed. METHOD: This cross-sectional, online descriptive questionnaire-based study was conducted in February and March 2020. A total of 485 participants from Arabic-speaking countries (Jordan, United Arab Emirates, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Palestine, and Egypt) were asked to complete this Arabic-translated survey using social media platforms (Facebook and WhatsApp). RESULT: In general, there was a good level of awareness of the participants regarding COVID-19. Higher awareness scores were significantly correlated with older participants [odds ratio (OR) 1.019; 95% CI 1.012–1.026], those who attended awareness campaigns [OR 1.212; 95% CI 1.081–1.358], secondary school education holders [OR 1.740; 95% CI 1.096–2.763], higher education diploma holders [OR 2.090; 95% CI 1.297–3.368], university degree holders [OR 1.969; 95% CI 1.265–3.066], those who have post-graduate education [OR 2.206; 95% CI 1.393–3.493], and healthcare employees [OR 1.259; 95% CI 1.025–1.547]. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic is causing global panic; thus, awareness and practices of preventive measures of COVID-19 should be increased through public educational campaigns, which should be planned in accordance with communities’ and countries’ attitudes toward COVID-19. Collaborative efforts between ministries of heath and residents of every country should be implemented.","Bonyan, Ruwidah; Al-Karasneh, Aseel Fuad; El-Dahiyat, Faris; Jairoun, Ammar Abdulrahman",J Pharm Policy Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32724659/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s40545-020-00247-x,210

Teratogenicity and hyperuricemia are known as the main side effects of favipiravir, but little is known about other side effects. This report describes a case of cholestatic liver injury induced by favipiravir. A 73-year-old Japanese with a history of alcoholic hepatitis was infected with SARS-CoV2. Drug therapy was instituted with lopinavir/ritonavir combined with interferon β-1b. However, his condition worsened despite additional support with continuous hemodiafiltration and veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. We suspected complications of bacterial pneumonia and started favipiravir in addition to antimicrobial therapy. Favipiravir was administered at 6000 mg/day on the first day and 2400 mg/day for the second and subsequent days for 14 days. After the initiation of antibiotics, transaminase and total bilirubin were elevated, suggesting a transient cholestasic liver dysfunction. The liver dysfunction in this case may have been triggered by antibacterial treatment, and high dose of favipiravir may have promoted the deterioration of liver function. Monitoring of liver function is vital and close attention should be paid when using favipiravir at high doses or in patients with impaired liver function.","Yamazaki, Shingo; Suzuki, Takaaki; Sayama, Misa; Nakada, Taka-aki; Igari, Hidetoshi; Ishii, Itsuko",J Infect Chemother,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1341321X20304566; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1341321X20304566; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiac.2020.12.021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33402301/,210

A plaque assay using Sephadex was simple; however, viable plaques could not be collected for propagation, and fixation was necessary before evaluation. Plaque formation under agarose was optimized using diethylaminoethyl-dextran (DEAE-D) in the pre-treatment and absorption media and trypsin added to the absorption media and agarose overlay. The use of DEAE-D alone, trypsin alone or trypsin combined with DEAE-D significantly increased plaque numbers and visibility. Plaque numbers were highest when pre-treatment media contained DEAE-D, absorption media contained DEAE-D and trypsin, and the agarose overlay contained trypsin. The assay was useful for plaque isolation and quantification of sialodacryoadenitis virus (SDA), Parker's rat coronavirus (PRCV) and other coronavirus isolates from rats and its specificity was demonstrated by plaque-reduction neutralization testing. These methods will facilitate production of cloned virus stocks for study of RCV biology and virus quantification for in vitro and in vivo studies of RCVs.","Gaertner, D. J.; Winograd, D.

637929,Step-by-step inpatient rehabilitation for critical illness after coronavirus disease 2019: A CARE-compliant case report,2021-06-11,"Abstract Viral proteins of two strains of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), which have different tissue trophism and serology, were separated on the basis of their isoelectric points (pI). The viruses have four structural proteins; the protein of greatest serological importance is found at the peplomer tip. The viral structural proteins separated by isoelectric focusing were identified by comparison to SDS-PAGE separations. Three protein bands were identical in pI and one protein band showed a difference in pI between strains. When the renatured viral proteins were Western blotted and reacted with strain-specific antiserum, antigen-antibody complexing was seen only at points corresponding to the strain-specific variant bands. For IBV strain Mass-41, antigen-antibody complexing occurred at a pI of 6.8, and, for IBV strain Ark-99, at 7.2. No cross reaction of antisera was observed for either strain. Since tissue affinities are a function of the viral peplomer-mediated attachment of virus to cells and are often directly related to pathogenicity, it appears that altered pathogenicity of strains of IBV may be detected by alteration of pI of the proteins. Classification by pI of proteins of at least the smaller viruses allows untypeable, highly pathogenic or persistent strains of these viruses to be characterized on the basis of variant proteins.","Sadasiv, Eileen C.; Yeh, Tamson T.; Chang, Pei W.",Journal of Virological Methods,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016609349190012O; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1658026/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/016609349190012O,210

Although the main clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are respiratory, many patients also display acute myocardial injury and chronic damage to the cardiovascular system. Understanding both direct and indirect damage caused to the heart and the vascular system by SARS-CoV-2 infection is necessary to identify optimal clinical care strategies. The homeostasis of the cardiovascular system requires a tight regulation of the gene expression, which is controlled by multiple types of RNA molecules, including RNA encoding proteins (messenger RNAs) (mRNAs) and those lacking protein-coding potential, the noncoding-RNAs. In the last few years, dysregulation of noncoding-RNAs has emerged as a crucial component in the pathophysiology of virtually all cardiovascular diseases.

Stringent government-mandated physical distancing measures (lockdown) have been demonstrated to be epidemiologically effective, but can have both positive and negative economic consequences. The duration and frequency of any intervention policy could, in theory, could be optimised to maximise economic benefits while achieving substantial reductions in disease. Methods Here we use a pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 transmission model to assess the health and economic implications of different strengths of control through time in order to identify optimal approaches to non-pharmaceutical intervention stringency in the UK, considering the role of vaccination in reducing the need for future physical distancing measures. The model is calibrated to the COVID-19 epidemic in England and we carry out retrospective analysis of the optimal timing of precautionary breaks in 2020 and the optimal relaxation policy from the January 2021 lockdown, considering the willingness to pay for health improvement. Results We find that the precise timing and intensity of interventions is highly dependent upon the objective of control. As intervention measures are relaxed, we predict a resurgence in cases, but the optimal intervention policy can be established dependent upon the willingness to pay (WTP) per QALY loss avoided. Our results show that establishing an optimal level of control can result in a reduction in net monetary loss of billions of pounds, dependent upon the precise WTP value. Conclusions It is vital, as the UK emerges from lockdown, but continues to face an on-going pandemic, to accurately establish the overall health and economic costs when making policy decisions. We demonstrate how some of these can be quantified, employing mechanistic infectious disease transmission models to establish optimal levels of control for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Tildesley, M.; Vassall, A.; Riley, S.; Jit, M.; Sandmann, F.; Hill, E.

We compared the mutational spectrum in the new SARS-CoV-2 mutation dataset with the previously published mutation spectrum in hypermutated genomes of rubella - another positive single stranded (ss) RNA virus. Each of the rubella isolates arose by accumulation of hundreds of mutations during propagation in a single subject, while SARS-CoV-2 mutation spectrum represents a collection events in multiple virus isolates from individuals across the world. We found a clear similarity between the spectra of single base substitutions in rubella and in SARS-CoV-2, with C to U as well as A to G and U to C being the most prominent in plus strand genomic RNA of each virus. Of those, U to C changes universally showed preference for loops versus stems in predicted RNA secondary structure. Similarly, to what was previously reported for rubella, C to U changes showed enrichment in the uCn motif, which suggested a subclass of APOBEC cytidine deaminase being a source of these substitutions. We also found enrichment of several other trinucleotide-centered mutation motifs only in SARS-CoV-2 - likely indicative of a mutation process characteristic to this virus. Altogether, the results of this analysis suggest that the mutation mechanisms that lead to hypermutation of the rubella vaccine virus in a rare pathological condition may also operate in the background of the SARS-CoV-2 viruses currently propagating in the human population.","Klimczak, Leszek J.; Randall, Thomas A.; Saini, Natalie; Li, Jian-Liang; Gordenin, Dmitry A.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.03.234005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32793907/,210

They can renew themselves continuously and, under certain conditions, differentiate into one or more cell types constituting human tissues and organs. HUC-MSCs differentiate, among others, into osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and adipocytes and have the ability to secrete cytokines. The possibility of noninvasive harvesting and low immunogenicity of HUC-MSCs give them a unique advantage in clinical applications. In recent years, HUC-MSCs have been widely used in clinical practice, and some progress has been made in their use for therapeutic purposes. MAIN BODY: This article describes two aspects of the clinical therapeutic effects of HUC-MSCs. On the one hand, it explains the benefits and mechanisms of HUC-MSC treatment in various diseases. On the other hand, it summarizes the results of basic research on HUC-MSCs related to clinical applications. The first part of this review highlights several functions of HUC-MSCs that are critical for their therapeutic properties: differentiation into terminal cells, immune regulation, paracrine effects, anti-inflammatory effects, anti-fibrotic effects, and regulating non-coding RNA. These characteristics of HUC-MSCs are discussed in the context of diabetes and its complications, liver disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, arthritis, brain injury and cerebrovascular diseases, heart diseases, spinal cord injury, respiratory diseases, viral infections, and other diseases. The second part emphasizes the need to establish an HUC-MSC cell bank, discusses tumorigenicity of HUC-MSCs and the characteristics of different in vitro generations of these cells in the treatment of diseases, and provides technical and theoretical support for the clinical applications of HUC-MSCs. CONCLUSION: HUC-MSCs can treat a variety of diseases clinically and have achieved good therapeutic effects, and the development of HUC-MSC assistive technology has laid the foundation for its clinical application.","Xie, Qixin; Liu, Rui; Jiang, Jia; Peng, Jing; Yang, Chunyan; Zhang, Wen; Wang, Sheng; Song, Jing",Stem Cell Res Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33261658/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13287-020-02011-z,210

Different age-groups are also impacted differently. However, it remains unclear whether the time from symptom onset to diagnosis and hospitalization or the length of stay in the hospital is different for different age groups, gender, residence place or whether it is time dependent. Methods Sciensano, the Belgian Scientific Institute of Public Health, collected information on hospitalized patients with COVID-19 hospital admissions from 114 participating hospitals in Belgium. Between March 14, 2020 and June 12, 2020, a total of 14,618 COVID-19 patients were registered. The time of symptom onset, time of COVID-19 diagnosis, time of hospitalization, time of recovery or death, and length of stay in intensive care are recorded. The distributions of these different event times for different age groups are estimated accounting for interval censoring and right truncation in the observed data. Results The truncated and interval-censored Weibull regression model is the best model for the time between symptom onset and diagnosis/hospitalization best, whereas the length of stay in hospital is best described by a truncated and interval-censored lognormal regression model. Conclusions The time between symptom onset and hospitalization and between symptom onset and diagnosis are very similar, with median length between symptom onset and hospitalization ranging between 3 and 10.4 days, depending on the age of the patient and whether or not the patient lives in a nursing home. Patients coming from a nursing home facility have a slightly prolonged time between symptom onset and hospitalization (i.e., 2 days). The longest delay time is observed in the age group 20-60 years old. The time from symptom onset to diagnosis follows the same trend, but on average is one day longer as compared to the time to hospitalization. The median length of stay in hospital varies between 3 and 10.4 days, with the length of stay increasing with age. However, a difference is observed between patients that recover and patients that die. While the hospital length of stay for patients that recover increases with age, we observe the longest time between hospitalization and death in the age group 20-60. And, while the hospital length of stay for patients that recover is shorter for patients living in a nursing home, the time from hospitalization to death is longer for these patients. But, over the course of the first wave, the length of stay has decreased, with a decrease in median length of stay of around 2 days.","Faes, C.; Abrams, S.; Van Beckhoven, D.; Meyfroidt, G.; Vlieghe, E.; Hens, N.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.18.20156307; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.18.20156307v1?rss=1,210

Once PwD are admitted to hospitals, their cognitive impairment is not considered in most of the cases. Thus, it causes an impact on the development of the disease becoming a stressful situation as care plans are not adapted to PwD. The aim of this study was to explore the published core elements when designing a dementia care pathway for hospital settings. A scoping review was conducted to provide an overview of the available research evidence and identify the knowledge gaps regarding the topic. This review highlights person-centered care, compassionate care and end-of-life process as some of the key elements that should integrate the framework when designing a dementia care pathway. Architectonical outdoor and indoor hospital elements have also been found to be considered when adapting the healthcare context to PwD. Findings provide information about the key points to focus on to successfully design dementia interventions in hospital environments within available resources, mostly in those contexts in which national dementia plans are in its infancy.

To meet this challenge, participants need an informed approach for working safely with the etiological agent, the novel human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Work with infectious SARS-CoV-2 is currently restricted to high-containment laboratories, but material can be handled at a lower containment level after inactivation. Given the wide array of inactivation reagents that are being used in laboratories during this pandemic, it is vital that their effectiveness is thoroughly investigated. Here, we evaluated a total of 23 commercial reagents designed for clinical sample transportation, nucleic acid extraction and virus inactivation for their ability to inactivate SARS-CoV-2, as well as seven other common chemicals including detergents and fixatives. As part of this study, we have also tested five filtration matrices for their effectiveness at removing the cytotoxic elements of each reagent, permitting accurate determination of levels of infectious virus remaining following treatment. In addition to providing critical data informing inactivation methods and risk assessments for diagnostic and research laboratories working with SARS-CoV-2, these data provide a framework for other laboratories to validate their inactivation processes and to guide similar studies for other pathogens.","Welch, Stephen R.; Davies, Katherine A.; Buczkowski, Hubert; Hettiarachchi, Nipunadi; Green, Nicole; Arnold, Ulrike; Jones, Matthew; Hannah, Matthew J.; Evans, Reah; Burton, Christopher; Burton, Jane E.; Guiver, Malcolm; Cane, Patricia A.; Woodford, Neil; Bruce, Christine B.; Roberts, Allen D.

Mobile technology use, however, is ubiquitous. We review advantages and challenges posed by mobile health (mHealth) and telehealth-based physical activity interventions aimed at adolescents. RECENT FINDINGS: Mobile Health (mHealth) and telehealth interventions to increase physical activity in adolescents include use of wearable activity trackers, text messages or apps, and video visits with exercise specialists. Definitions and goals for physical activity differ across interventions, and methods of activity measurement also vary. User engagement is often poor, if tracked at all. No identified studies included use of behavioral economics-informed engagement strategies. SUMMARY: Intervention designers must plan for ways to maximize engagement and to reliably measure the intended outcome. Although mHealth and telehealth interventions have advantages such as scalability and acceptability, potential pitfalls must be addressed before widespread implementation.","Vajravelu, Mary Ellen; Arslanian, Silva",Curr Obes Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34596867/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s13679-021-00456-8,210

We hypothesized that there would be no difference in pelvic organ prolapse (POP) recurrence 2 years following transvaginal uterosacral ligament hysteropexy (USLH) and sacrospinous ligament hysteropexy (SSLH). METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study with a cross-sectional survey of women who underwent transvaginal uterine-preserving POP surgery from May 2016 to December 2017. Patients were included if they underwent either USLH or SSLH. POP recurrence was defined as a composite of subjective symptoms and/or retreatment. A cross-sectional survey was used to assess pelvic floor symptoms and patient satisfaction. RESULTS: A total of 47 women met the criteria. Mean age was 52.8 ± 12.5 years, and all had a preoperative POP-Q stage of 2 (55.3%) or 3 (44.7%). Thirty (63.8%) underwent SSLH and 17 (36.2%) underwent USLH. There were no differences in patient characteristics or perioperative data. There was no difference in composite recurrence (26.7% [8] vs 23.5% [4]) and retreatment (6.7% [2] vs 0%) retrospectively between SSLH and USLH groups at 22.6 months. Survey response rate was 80.9% (38) with a response time of 30.7 (28.0–36.6) months. The majority of patients (84.2%) reported POP symptom improvement, and both groups reported great satisfaction (89.5%). In respondents, 13.2% (5) reported subjective recurrence and 5.3% (2) underwent retreatment, with no differences between hysteropexy types. There were no differences in other pelvic floor symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Although 1 in 4 women experienced subjective POP recurrence after transvaginal uterine-preserving prolapse repair and <5% underwent retreatment at 2 years, our results must be interpreted with caution given our small sample size. No differences in outcomes were identified between hysteropexy types; however, additional studies should be performed to confirm these findings. Both hysteropexy approaches were associated with great patient satisfaction.

Trait anxiety, situation‐specific coping strategies, and coping flexibility were proposed as predictors of state anxiety during the early phase of the SARS epidemic. Seven‐two Hong Kong undergraduates (31 men, 41 women) participated in a prospective, multiple time‐point study. Participants' trait anxiety and coping flexibility had been assessed in an earlier study. Five months later, they reported their anxiety and coping at each of the four time points during the outbreak. Results revealed fluctuations in state anxiety across time points. Results from hierarchical linear modeling showed that trait anxiety as well as the situation‐appropriate coping strategies of avoidance and personal hygiene practice accounted for changes in state anxiety.","Cheng, Cecilia; Cheung, Mike W.

Temperature quench echoes generated by applying two successive cooling signals have therefore been analyzed in terms of the temperature-temperature correlation function of the protease within the harmonic approximation. An exponentially decaying brand of behavior has been found for the calculated echo depth values with increasing time, which has accordingly led to a much small dephasing time of about 150 fs, revealing a significant anharmonicity and therefore an overall structural stiffness for the COVID-19 main protease.","Shekaari, Ashkan; Jafari, Mahmoud",J Mol Struct,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022286020315556; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022286020315556?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molstruc.2020.129235; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32929291/,210

These platforms have shown promise in many ways for improving various health outcomes and overall communication between patient and provider. OBJECTIVE: Assess the impact of automated portal reminder messages and self-scheduling options on increasing rates of annual influenza vaccination. DESIGN: This is a prospective, randomized, controlled study. PARTICIPANTS: All patients who receive their primary care through an ambulatory primary care clinic at a large, multidisciplinary, academic health center. INTERVENTIONS: One group of patients received a portal message reminder to undergo influenza vaccination. A second group received the same message with instructions to self-schedule the vaccination appointment. A third group received no portal message (control). MAIN MEASURES: Rates of influenza vaccination in each group for previously unvaccinated patients in the 2019−2020 influenza season. KEY RESULTS: For the group receiving the message with self-scheduling option (n=5408), the in-study vaccination rate was significantly greater than the group receiving no message (n=5621) (15.7% vs. 13.5%; p=0.002). For the group receiving a message alone (without self-scheduling) (n=5699), the in-study vaccination rate was significantly greater than the group receiving no message (15.1% vs. 13.5%; p=0.01). There was no significant difference in vaccination rate between the two intervention groups receiving messages (15.7% vs. 15.1%; p=0.549).

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) and epicardial fat (EAT) have shown to outperform traditional risk factors in predicting cardiovascular events in the general population. We aim to determine if CAC and EAT determined by Computed Tomographic (CT) scanning can predict all-cause mortality in patients admitted with COVID-19 disease. We performed a retrospective, post-hoc analysis of all patients admitted to Montefiore Medical Center with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis from March 1st, 2020 to May 2nd, 2020 who had a non-contrast CT of the chest within 5 years prior to admission. We determined ordinal CAC scores and quantified the epicardial (EAT) and thoracic (TAT) fat volume and examined their relationship with inpatient mortality. A total of 493 patients were analyzed. There were 197 deaths (39.95%). Patients who died during the index admission had higher age (72, [64–80] vs 68, [57–76]; p < 0.001), CAC score (3, [0–6] vs 1, [0–4]; p < 0.001) and EAT (107, [70–152] vs 94, [64–129]; p = 0.023). On a competing risk analysis regression model, CAC ≥ 4 and EAT ≥ median (98 ml) were independent predictors of mortality with increased mortality of 63% (p = 0.003) and 43% (p = 0.032), respectively. As a composite, the group with a combination of CAC ≥ 4 and EAT ≥ 98 ml had the highest mortality.

In this context we deemed interesting to further investigate the structure activity relationship (SAR) of our first series of cycloguanil-like dihydrotriazines, designing two novel azaspiro dihydrotriazine scaffolds. The present study allowed the exploration of the potential chemical space, around these new scaffolds, that are well tolerated for maintaining the antiviral effect by means of interaction with the hDHFR enzyme. The new derivatives confirmed their inhibitory profile against influenza viruses, especially type B. In particular, the two best compounds shared potent antiviral activity (4: EC(50) = 0.29 μM; 6: EC(50) = 0.19 μM), which was comparable to that of zanamivir (EC(50) = 0.14 μM), and better than that of ribavirin (EC(50) = 3.2 μM). In addition, these two compounds proved to be also effective against RSV (4: EC(50) = 0.40 μM, SI ≥ 250; 6: EC(50) = 1.8 μM, SI ≥ 56), surpassing the potency and selectivity index (SI) of ribavirin (EC(50) = 5.8 μM, SI > 43).

This study investigated i) the extent to which Italian immigrants in Norway perceive that moving had a negative or positive impact on their PA; ii) possible differences between the PA of the Italian immigrants compared with the Norwegian population; and iii) possible associations of the Italian immigrants' PA with key sociodemographic characteristics (gender, age, region of residence, and educational level). The data were retrieved from the Mens Sana in Corpore Sano study. In order to enhance the sample's representativeness, the original dataset (n = 321) was oversampled in accordance with the proportion of key sociodemographic characteristics of the reference population using the ADASYN method (resampled n = 531). The results indicate that a large majority of Italian immigrants perceived that they were as or even more physically active in Norway than they would have been if they continued living in Italy, while 20% of the Italians perceived instead a negative impact. No significant differences were found in the PA levels of the Italians in comparison with the Norwegian population, though some differences were found in relation to specific modes of PA. After controlling for multiple sociodemographic characteristics, men, those with lower educational levels and, to a certain extent, older adults tended to perceive a more negative impact and be less physically active than their respective counterparts. Compared with those living in the most urbanized regions, a larger proportion of those living in less urbanized regions perceived a negative impact, though no differences were observed in terms of PA levels. The findings are discussed in light of acculturation, gender, and social gradient.

From the clinical immunology perspective, there is strong justification to expect differential responses to convalescent plasma in patients who already have their own antibodies to SARS-CoV2 (seropositive) versus those who do not (seronegative). Methods: Outcome data was extracted from the RECOVERY trial both overall and for seronegative participants. A Bayesian re-analysis with a wide variety of priors (vague, optimistic, skeptical and pessimistic) was performed calculating the posterior probability for both any benefit or a modest benefit (number needed to treat of 100). Results: Across all patients, when analysed with a vague prior the likelihood of any benefit or a modest benefit was estimated to be 64% and 18% respectively. In contrast, in the seronegative subgroup, the likelihood of any benefit or a modest benefit was estimated to be 90% and 74%. Results were broadly consistent across all prior distributions. Conclusion: Performing clinical trials during a pandemic is challenging, and RECOVERY has provided high quality evidence for numerous therapies. However, the use of frequentist hypothesis testing in this trial has led to the trialists and governing bodies to conclude a strong evidence of no effect. Based on this trial, and other prior knowledge there remains a strong probability that convalescent plasma provides at least a modest benefit in seronegative patients.","Hamilton, F. W.; Lee, T.

This organism is unique in that it causes proliferation of infected enterocytes, resulting in thickening of the intestinal epithelium, most often the small intestine. This disease affects mainly weanling foals and causes fever, lethargy, peripheral edema, diarrhea, colic and weight loss. The diagnosis of EPE may be challenging and relies on the presence of hypoproteinemia, thickening of segments of the small intestinal wall observed on abdominal ultrasonography, positive serology and molecular detection of L. intracellularis in feces. The epidemiology and genetic basis for pathogenesis for this disease is beginning to be elucidated. Phenotypic traits, genomic features, and gene expression profiles during L. intracellularis infection in vitro and in vivo are presented. In addition, this article reviews the epidemiology, pathological and clinicopathological findings, diagnosis, and control of EPE.","Pusterla, Nicola; Gebhart, Connie",Vet Microbiol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113513003313; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2013.06.017; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113513003313; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23871678/,210

However, the majority of these new virus sequences have no assigned host. Current machine learning approaches to predicting virus host interactions have a tendency to focus on nucleotide features, ignoring other representations of genomic information. Here we investigate the predictive potential of features generated from four different ‘levels’ of viral genome representation: nucleotide, amino acid, amino acid properties and protein domains. This more fully exploits the biological information present in the virus genomes. Over a hundred and eighty binary datasets for infecting versus non-infecting viruses at all taxonomic ranks of both eukaryote and prokaryote hosts were compiled. The viral genomes were converted into the four different levels of genome representation and twenty feature sets were generated by extracting k-mer compositions and predicted protein domains. We trained and tested Support Vector Machine, SVM, classifiers to compare the predictive capacity of each of these feature sets for each dataset. Our results show that all levels of genome representation are consistently predictive of host taxonomy and that prediction k-mer composition improves with increasing k-mer length for all k-mer based features. Using a phylogenetically aware holdout method, we demonstrate that the predictive feature sets contain signals reflecting both the evolutionary relationship between the viruses infecting related hosts, and host-mimicry. Our results demonstrate that incorporating a range of complementary features, generated purely from virus genome sequences, leads to improved accuracy for a range of virus host prediction tasks enabling computational assignment of host taxonomic information.","Young, Francesca; Rogers, Simon; Robertson, David L.",PLoS Comput Biol,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007894; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32453718/,210

Methods: We evaluated the risk for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among patients living with cancer compared to the general community and whether cancer-related treatments influence this risk. Data were collected from the COVID Symptom Study smartphone application since March 24, 2020 (United Kingdom), March 29 (U.S.), and April 29, 2020 (Sweden) through May 8, 2020. We used multivariate-adjusted odds ratios (aORs) of a positive COVID-19 test as well as predicted COVID-19 infection using a validated symptom model. Results: Among 23,266 participants with cancer and 1,784,293 without cancer, we documented 10,404 reports of a positive COVID-19 test. Compared to participants without cancer, those living with cancer had 62% increased risk of a positive COVID-19 test (95% CI: 1.37-1.91). Among patients with cancer, current treatment with chemotherapy/immunotherapy was associated with a nearly 2.5-fold increased risk of a positive test (aOR: 2.42; 95% CI: 1.81-3.25).

These viruses usually cause a mild to moderate upper respiratory tract infection, however, they can also cause more severe symptoms, gastrointestinal and central nervous system diseases. These viruses are capable of flexibly adapting to new environments, hence health threats from coronavirus are constant and long-term. Immunogenic spike proteins are glyco-proteins found on the surface of Coronaviridae particles that mediate entry to host cells. The aim of this study was to train deep learning neural networks to produce simulated spike protein sequences, which may be able to aid in knowledge and/or vaccine design by creating alternative possible spike sequences that could arise from zoonotic sources in future. Results Here we have trained deep learning recurrent neural networks (RNN) to provide computer-simulated coronavirus spike protein sequences in the style of previously known sequences and examine their characteristics. Training used a dataset of alpha, beta, gamma and delta coronavirus spike sequences. In a test set of 100 simulated sequences, all 100 had most significant BLAST matches to Spike proteins in searches against NCBI non-redundant dataset (NR) and also possessed concomitant Pfam domain matches. Conclusions Simulated sequences from the neural network may be able to guide us in future with prospective targets for vaccine discovery in advance of a potential novel zoonosis. We may effectively be able to fast-forward through evolution using neural networks to investigate sequences that could arise.","Crossman, Lisa C",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.20.046920,210

Methods: A total number of 331 patients confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled. The plasma of these patients were collected during hospitalization and were detected for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody. Afterwards, the difference of IgG antibody between male and female patients was analyzed. Results: The level of IgG antibody in mild, general and recovering patients showed on difference between male and female. In severe status, the average IgG antibody level in female patients tended to be higher than that of in male patients. Compared with male patients, most of the female patients generated a relatively high level of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody in severe status. In addition, the generation of IgG antibody in female tended to be stronger than male patients in disease early phase. Conclusions: The inconsistent of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody generation in male and female patients may account for the different outcome of COVID-19 between gender.","Zeng, Fanfan; Dai, Chan; Cai, Pengcheng; Wang, Jinbiao; Xu, Lei; Li, Jianyu; Hu, Guoyun; Wang, Lin",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.26.20040709,210

We developed and optimized a dual priming oligonucleotide (DPO) multiplex PCR assay for detecting influenza viruses including seasonal H1N1, 2009 pandemic H1N1, H3N2, influenza B and H5N1. METHODS: The optimized multiplex DPO PCR was used to detect 233 clinical human samples. The results were compared to those obtained with RT-qPCR, conventional PCR and immunochromatographic assay. RESULTS: Specificity analysis revealed that the DPO PCR assay amplified each target virus without any cross-amplification. Statistical analysis demonstrated that the multiplex DPO-PCR sensitivity was higher than for the immunochromatographic assay and lower than for qPCR, while no significant difference was observed compared with conventional PCR, when detecting influenza A and B. Additional experiments using the same sample panel indicated no significant differences between the number of positive samples detected by multiplex DPO PCR and RT-qPCR when applying a Cq with a value lower than 30. CONCLUSIONS: The five-targeted simultaneous multiplex DPO PCR assay could be easily adopted into routine practice. This approach is cost effective with a short running time, low technical requirements for the detection of influenza virus and early diagnosis in clinical laboratories.","Ma, Xuezheng; Xu, Huanzhou; Shi, Lei; Yang, Pengfei; Zhang, Liping; Sun, Xiaohong; Zhen, Wei; Hu, Kongxin",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25886516/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-015-0818-y,210

Yet, previous research reveals that cranberry growers have mixed attitudes about the anthropogenic roots of climate change, with many being skeptical. Building on the researchers’ analysis of the personal and ecological conditions that affect climate change attitudes among cranberry growers, this paper examines the effect that key actors in the growers’ social networks have on those attitudes. Through statistical analysis of survey data and content analysis of two important cranberry newsletters, the paper finds that cranberry growers’ perceived importance of two key cranberry growing institutions, the “sociopolitically focused” Cape Cod Cranberry Growers’ Association and the “technically focused” University of Massachusetts Cranberry Station, as well as connections to other cranberry growers, is associated in nuanced ways with growers’ climate change attitudes. Drawing on the sociological theory of “social capital,” the paper examines how these social ties to key actors/institutions may result in greater threat perception or worry about climate change. It then considers how “green ties,” if harnessed and supported by these important actors in the cranberry grower network, might significantly mitigate climate change in the future.

Focusing on Coronavirus Disease 2019 Impact on Lung Cancer Resection, Published in June 2020",2020-09-24,"BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus is a major global public health issue where self-management is critical to reducing disease burden. Social media has been a powerful tool to understand public perceptions. Public perception of the drugs used for the treatment of diabetes may be useful for orienting interventions to increase adherence. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the public perceptions of anti-diabetic drugs through the analysis of health-related tweets mentioning such medications. METHODS: This study uses an infoveillance social listening approach to monitor public discourse using Twitter data. We coded 4000 tweets from January 1, 2019 to October 1, 2019 containing key terms related to anti-diabetic drugs by using qualitative content analysis. Tweets were coded for whether they were truly about an anti-diabetic drug and whether they were health-related. Health-related tweets were further coded based on who was tweeting, which anti-diabetic drug was being tweeted about, and the content discussed in the tweet. The main outcome of the analysis was the themes identified by analyzing the content of health-related tweets on anti-diabetic drugs. RESULTS: We identified 1664 health-related tweets on 33 anti-diabetic drugs. A quarter (415/1664) of the tweets were confirmed to have been from people with diabetes, 17.9% (298/1664) from people posting about someone else, and 2.7% (45/1664) from health care professionals. However, the role of the tweeter was unidentifiable in two-thirds of the tweets. We identified 13 themes, with the health consequences of the cost of anti-diabetic drugs being the most extensively discussed, followed by the efficacy and availability. We also identified issues that patients may conceal from health care professionals, such as purchasing medications from unofficial sources. CONCLUSIONS: This study uses an infoveillance approach using Twitter data to explore public perceptions related to anti-diabetic drugs. This analysis gives an insight into the real-life issues that an individual faces when taking anti-diabetic drugs, and such findings may be incorporated into health policies to improve compliance and efficacy. This study suggests that there is a fear of not having access to anti-diabetic drugs due to cost or physical availability and highlights the impact of the sacrifices made to access anti-diabetic drugs. Along with screening for diabetes-related health issues, health care professionals should also ask their patients about any non–health-related concerns regarding their anti-diabetic drugs. The positive tweets about dietary changes indicate that people with type 2 diabetes may be more open to self-management than what the health care professionals believe.","Golder, Su; Bach, Millie; O'Connor, Karen; Gross, Robert; Hennessy, Sean; Gonzalez Hernandez, Graciela",JMIR Diabetes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33496671/; https://doi.org/10.2196/24681,210

TNC is transiently expressed in the heart during embryonic development, but is rarely detected in normal adults; however, its expression is strongly up-regulated with inflammation. Although neither TNC-knockout nor -overexpressing mice show a distinct phenotype, disease models using genetically engineered mice combined with in vitro experiments have revealed multiple significant roles for TNC in responses to injury and myocardial repair, particularly in the regulation of inflammation. In most cases, TNC appears to deteriorate adverse ventricular remodeling by aggravating inflammation/fibrosis. Furthermore, accumulating clinical evidence has shown that high TNC levels predict adverse ventricular remodeling and a poor prognosis in patients with various heart diseases. Since the importance of inflammation has attracted attention in the pathophysiology of heart diseases, this review will focus on the roles of TNC in various types of inflammatory reactions, such as myocardial infarction, hypertensive fibrosis, myocarditis caused by viral infection or autoimmunity, and dilated cardiomyopathy. The utility of TNC as a biomarker for the stratification of myocardial disease conditions and the selection of appropriate therapies will also be discussed from a clinical viewpoint.","Imanaka-Yoshida, Kyoko",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22115828; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34072423/,210

They reviewed Epi-Aid reports and EIS Bulletins, contacted current and former Epidemic Intelligence Service staff, and systematically searched the PubMed and Web of Science databases. They abstracted information on dates, location, staff involved, health problems, methods, and impacts of investigations according to a preplanned protocol. They assessed the methods presented as well as the quality of reports. During 1946–2005, a total of 4,484 investigations of health events were initiated by 2,815 Epidemic Intelligence Service officers. In the early years, the majority were in response to infectious agents, although environmental problems emerged. Investigations in subsequent years focused on occupational conditions, birth defects, reproductive health, tobacco use, cancer, violence, legal debate, and terrorism. These Epi-Aids heralded expansion of the agency's mission and presented new methods in statistics and epidemiology. Recommendations from Epi-Aids led to policy implementation, evaluation, or modification.

Ventricle size increased for 15 patients (71%) between scans [median bicaudate index 0.16 (IQR 0.126–0.181) initially and 0.167 (IQR 0.138–0.203) on final imaging (p < 0.001); median third ventricular diameter 6.9 mm (IQR 5.4–10.3) initially and 7.2 mm (IQR 6.4–10.8) on final imaging (p < 0.001)]. Every patient had white matter changes on the initial and final MRI; between images, they worsened for seven patients (33%) and improved for three (14%). CONCLUSIONS: On serial imaging of critically ill patients with COVID-19, ventricle size frequently increased over several weeks. White matter changes were often unchanged, but in some cases they worsened or improved, demonstrating there is likely a spectrum of pathophysiological processes responsible for these changes.

Developing novel therapeutics and a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 requires an understanding of the similarities and differences between the various human coronaviruses with regards to their phylogenic relationships, transmission, and management. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that humans were first infected with SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019 and the virus rapidly spread from the outbreak epicenter in Wuhan, China to various parts of the world. Multiple variants of SARS-CoV-2 have now been identified in particular regions. It is apparent that MERS, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 present with several common symptoms including fever, cough, and dyspnea in mild cases, but can also progress to pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Understanding the molecular steps leading to SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells and the viral replication cycle can illuminate crucial targets for testing several potential therapeutics. Genomic and structural details of SARS-CoV-2 and previous attempts to generate vaccines against SARS-CoV and MERS have provided vaccine targets to manage future outbreaks more effectively. The coordinated global response against this emerging infectious disease is unique and has helped address the need for urgent therapeutics and vaccines in a remarkably short time.","Oves, Mohammad; Ravindran, Mithunan; Rauf, Mohd Ahmar; Omaish Ansari, Mohammad; Zahin, Maryam; Iyer, Arun K.; Ismail, Iqbal M.

682591,Diarrhea as a Presenting Symptom of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Children,2020-08-28,"The hand of molecular mimicry in shaping SARS-CoV-2 evolution and immune evasion remains to be deciphered. Here, we report 33 distinct 8-mer/9-mer peptides that are identical between SARS-CoV-2 and the human reference proteome. We benchmark this observation against other viral–human 8-mer/9-mer peptide identity, which suggests generally similar extents of molecular mimicry for SARS-CoV-2 and many other human viruses. Interestingly, 20 novel human peptides mimicked by SARS-CoV-2 have not been observed in any previous coronavirus strains (HCoV, SARS-CoV, and MERS). Furthermore, four of the human 8-mer/9-mer peptides mimicked by SARS-CoV-2 map onto HLA-B*40:01, HLA-B*40:02, and HLA-B*35:01 binding peptides from human PAM, ANXA7, PGD, and ALOX5AP proteins. This mimicry of multiple human proteins by SARS-CoV-2 is made salient by single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) analysis that shows the targeted genes significantly expressed in human lungs and arteries; tissues implicated in COVID-19 pathogenesis. Finally, HLA-A*03 restricted 8-mer peptides are found to be shared broadly by human and coronaviridae helicases in functional hotspots, with potential implications for nucleic acid unwinding upon initial infection. This study presents the first scan of human peptide mimicry by SARS-CoV-2, and via its benchmarking against human–viral mimicry more broadly, presents a computational framework for follow-up studies to assay how evolutionary tinkering may relate to zoonosis and herd immunity.","Venkatakrishnan, A.

The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is characterized by infecting angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-expressing cells, including testis-specific cells, namely, Leydig, Sertoli, and spermatogenic cells, which are closely related to male reproduction. This leads to aberrant hyperactivation of the immune system generating damage to the infected organs. An impairment in testicular function through uncontrolled immune responses alerts more attention to male infertility. Meanwhile, the recent clinical data indicate that the infection of the human testis with SARS-CoV-2 may impair male germ cell development, leading to germ cell loss and higher immune cell infiltration. In this review, we investigated the evidence of male reproductive dysfunction associated with the infection with SARS-CoV-2 and its possible immunological explanations and clinical remedies.","Xu, Jia; He, Liting; Zhang, Yuan; Hu, Zhiyong; Su, Yufang; Fang, Yiwei; Peng, Meilin; Fan, Zunpan; Liu, Chunyan; Zhao, Kai; Zhang, Huiping",Front Physiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33935803/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2021.651408,210

690035,Coronavirus disease 2019 associated mucormycosis meandering its way into the orbit: a pictorial review,2021-09-15,"BACKGROUND: As the number of COVID-19 cases continues to rise, public health efforts must focus on preventing avoidable fatalities. Understanding the demographic and clinical characteristics of deceased COVID-19 patients; and estimation of time-interval between symptom onset, hospital admission and death could inform public health interventions focusing on preventing mortality due to COVID-19. METHODS: We obtained COVID-19 death summaries from the official dashboard of the Government of Tamil Nadu, between 10th May and July 10, 2020. Of the 1783 deaths, we included 1761 cases for analysis. RESULTS: The mean age of the deceased was 62.5 years (SD: 13.7). The crude death rate was 2.44 per 100,000 population; the age-specific death rate was 22.72 among above 75 years and 0.02 among less than 14 years, and it was higher among men (3.5 vs 1.4 per 100,000 population). Around 85% reported having any one or more comorbidities; Diabetes (62%), hypertension (49.2%) and CAD (17.5%) were the commonly reported comorbidities. The median time interval between symptom onset and hospital admission was 4 days (IQR: 2, 7); admission and death was 4 days (IQR: 2, 7) with a significant difference between the type of admitting hospital. One-fourth of (24.2%) deaths occurred within a day of hospital admission. CONCLUSION: Elderly, male, people living in densely populated areas and people with underlying comorbidities die disproportionately due to COVID-19. While shorter time-interval between symptom onset and admission is essential, the relatively short time interval between admission and death is a concern and the possible reasons must be evaluated and addressed to reduce avoidable mortality.","Asirvatham, Edwin Sam; Sarman, Charishma Jones; Saravanamurthy, Sakthivel P.; Mahalingam, Periasamy; Maduraipandian, Swarna; Lakshmanan, Jeyaseelan",Clin Epidemiol Glob Health,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213398420302189?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33043168/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2213398420302189; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cegh.2020.09.010,210
690199,The Use of Adjuvant Therapy in Preventing Progression to Severe Pneumonia in Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Multicenter Data Analysis,2020-04-10,"In Spain, most jobs available for Latin American immigrant women are in intimate labour (caregiving and domestic work). This work is usually performed under informal employment conditions. The objective of this study was to explain how the colonial logic mediates the experiences of Latin American women working in intimate labour in Spain, and the effects of such occupation on their health and wellbeing, using a decolonial theoretical framework. A multi-site secondary data analysis of qualitative data from four previous studies was performed utilizing 101 interviews with Latin American immigrant women working as caregivers in Spain. Three interwoven categories show how the dominant colonial logic in Spain creates low social status and precarious jobs, and naturalizes intimate labour as their métier while producing detrimental physical and psychosocial health consequences for these immigrant caregivers. The caregivers displayed several strategies to resist and navigate intimate labour and manage its negative impact on health. Respect and integration into the family for whom they work had a buffering effect, mediating the effects of working conditions on health and wellbeing. Based on our analysis, we suggest that employment, social, and health protection laws and strategies are needed to promote a positive working environment, and to reduce the impact of caregiving work for Latin American caregivers.","Briones-Vozmediano, Erica; Rivas-Quarneti, Natalia; Gea-Sánchez, Montserrat; Bover-Bover, Andreu; Carbonero, Maria Antonia; Gastaldo, Denise",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33182437/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17218278,210
