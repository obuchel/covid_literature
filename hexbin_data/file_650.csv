14131,REDIAL-2020: A Suite of Machine Learning Models to Estimate Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Activities,2020-09-16,"Zinc deficiency is a major public health problem in vulnerable populations of Latin America and the Caribbean. Biofortification of rice (Oryza sativa L.) with zinc has the potential to alleviate zinc deficiencies. However, as plant breeding processes can alter grain culinary quality and favorable sensory attributes, grain quality and consumer acceptability need to be assessed prior to releasing a variety to the public. A grain quality characterization and a sensory acceptability analysis were carried out with two varieties of zinc biofortified rice and a local control both in Bolivia and Colombia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the physicochemical parameters that are significant in consumer acceptance and to determine the acceptability of zinc biofortified rice by consumers. Results of physicochemical parameters were analyzed using ANOVA. The sensory acceptability was evaluated in 243 adults utilizing a 7-point hedonic scale and a Wilcoxon’s signed rank test was used to determine the overall acceptability of the varieties. Biofortified rice variety T2-11 and MAC-18 -control 1- were equally accepted by consumers in Bolivia with no significant differences (p<0.05). The grain quality analysis reported that both presented long and slender rice grains (L>7.5 mm and L/B>3), an intermediate to high amylose content (>25%) and a similar level of chalkiness. In Colombia, the biofortified variety 035 presented a higher score in overall acceptance in comparison to biofortified variety 021 and the local variety CICA4 -control 2-. However, no significant differences were observed (p<0.05). Conversely to the other two varieties, the biofortified variety 035 presented the largest size grain (L/B = 2.97), a lower chalkiness and an amylose content above 25%. This study shows that the grain quality properties of rice have an influence on acceptability and that zinc biofortified rice varieties are accepted by consumers.","Woods, Bo-Jane; Gallego-Castillo, Sonia; Talsma, Elise F.; Álvarez, Daniel",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7657500/,650
15097,Homology modeling of TMPRSS2 yields candidate drugs that may inhibit entry of SARS-CoV-2 into human cells.,2020-03-20,"BACKGROUND: Our goal was to investigate the role of physical exercise to protect brain health as we age, including the potential to mitigate Alzheimer’s-related pathology. We assessed the effect of 52 weeks of a supervised aerobic exercise program on amyloid accumulation, cognitive performance, and brain volume in cognitively normal older adults with elevated and sub-threshold levels of cerebral amyloid as measured by amyloid PET imaging. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This 52-week randomized controlled trial compared the effects of 150 minutes per week of aerobic exercise vs. education control intervention. A total of 117 underactive older adults (mean age 72.9 [7.7]) without evidence of cognitive impairment, with elevated (n = 79) or subthreshold (n = 38) levels of cerebral amyloid were randomized, and 110 participants completed the study. Exercise was conducted with supervision and monitoring by trained exercise specialists. We conducted 18F-AV45 PET imaging of cerebral amyloid and anatomical MRI for whole brain and hippocampal volume at baseline and Week 52 follow-up to index brain health. Neuropsychological tests were conducted at baseline, Week 26, and Week 52 to assess executive function, verbal memory, and visuospatial cognitive domains. Cardiorespiratory fitness testing was performed at baseline and Week 52 to assess response to exercise. The aerobic exercise group significantly improved cardiorespiratory fitness (11% vs. 1% in the control group) but there were no differences in change measures of amyloid, brain volume, or cognitive performance compared to control. CONCLUSIONS: Aerobic exercise was not associated with reduced amyloid accumulation in cognitively normal older adults with cerebral amyloid. In spite of strong systemic cardiorespiratory effects of the intervention, the observed lack of cognitive or brain structure benefits suggests brain benefits of exercise reported in other studies are likely to be related to non-amyloid effects.

23411,The SARS-CoV Fusion Peptide Forms an Extended Bipartite Fusion Platform that Perturbs Membrane Order in a Calcium-Dependent Manner,2019-02-15,"BACKGROUND: Viral respiratory infections are a common cause of hospitalization for younger, otherwise-healthy populations. In this study, we describe the epidemiology of influenza-like illness in non-elderly adults within the U.S. Military Health System (MHS) by pathogen and hospitalization status. METHODS: The Acute Respiratory Infection Consortium (ARIC) is a prospective cohort of patients with influenza-like illness within the MHS. Participants between 18 and 65 years of age were identified in outpatient settings between 2012 and 2017, and were excluded if pregnant, if reporting chronic cardiac, respiratory, renal, or neurologic disease, or if on long-term aspirin therapy. Demographics, nasopharyngeal swabs and symptom data were collected; swabs were tested for viral pathogens using a target-enriched multiplex PCR panel (TEM-PCR(TM), Diatherix LLC). Data were analyzed to compare clinical features and risks for hospitalization. RESULTS: 397 participants met inclusion criteria. 34 participants required hospitalization; 363 were outpatients. Median length of hospitalization was 2 days. A virus was identified in 58.4% of outpatients (OP) and 55.9% of inpatients (IP); coronaviruses (63/363), enteroviruses (50/363), and influenza A (73/363) predominated in OP, whereas influenza A predominated among IP (35.3%, 12/34). There were no significant differences between OP and IP in terms of age, gender, ethnicity, or tobacco use. IP were more likely to be obese (BMI ≥30, 43.3% vs. 20.5%, P = 0.004) and less likely to have received influenza vaccination (45.5% vs. 16.9%, P > 0.001). IP with influenza did not report more severe symptoms (chills, cough, sore throat, diarrhea, myalgia, or headache) on enrollment but were more likely to have fever (temperature ≥38.0⁰ C) than OP (92.9 vs. 57.1%, P = 0.014). CONCLUSION: Influenza A is the most frequently identified cause of hospitalization among healthy, non-elderly adults with viral respiratory infection. Although age and tobacco use may be risks for viral acquisition, they do not appear to increase the risk of hospitalization in infected patients. Non-obese BMI and influenza vaccination appear protective against hospitalization, even in a relatively healthy cohort. DISCLOSURES: L. Malone, Diatherix Laboratories: Employee, Salary; E.

Therefore, NIV should be preferred to invasive ventilation whenever possible [1]. In clinical settings, most of the patients were treated by NIV because of pulmonary edema or exacerbated chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) [2]. With endemic and high-risk infection, most of the critically ill patients develop acute lung injury (ALI) and/or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Furthermore, NIV, an “aerosol-producing factor” might be regarded as a high-risk procedure for medical staff [3].","Keymel, Stefanie; Steiner, Stephan",Noninvasive Ventilation in High-Risk Infections and Mass Casualty Events,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120195/,650
25461,Rule Generation Using NN and GA for SARS-CoV Cleavage Site Prediction,2005,"The first description of dermatophytosis was recorded by Celsus, a Roman encyclopaedist who described a suppurative infection of scalp (‘porrigo’ or ‘kerion of Celsus’) in De Re Medicina (30 A.D.). Throughout the middle ages, several descriptions of dermatophytosis were produced where it is described as ‘tinea’. The keratin-destroying moths which made circular holes in the woollen garments are known as Tinea. Due to similarity in the structure of circular lesion of dermatophytosis on the smooth skin with the circular hole made by moth, Cassius Felix introduced the term ‘tinea’ to describe the lesions. In 1806, Alibert used the term ‘favus’ to describe the honey-like exudate in some scalp infections. However, the fungal aetiology of tinea was first detected by Robert Remak, a Polish physician who first observed the presence of hyphae in the crusts of favus. This detection is also a landmark in medical history because this is the first description of a microbe causing a human disease. He himself did not publish his work, but he permitted the reference of his observations in a dissertation by Xavier Hube in 1837. Remak gave all the credits of his discovery to his mentor Schoenlein who first published the fungal etiological report of favus in 1839. He observed the infectious nature of the favus by autoinoculation into his own hands and also successfully isolated the fungus later (1945) and named Achorion schoenleinii (Trichophyton schoenleinii) in honour of his mentor. In 1844, Gruby described the etiologic agent of tinea endothrix, later became known as Trichophyton tonsurans. The genus Trichophyton was created and described by Malmsten (1845) with its representative species T. tonsurans. Charles Robin identified T. mentagrophytes in 1847 and T. equinum was identified by Matruchot and Dassonville in 1898. Raymond Jacques Adrien Sabouraud (France) first compiled the description of Trichophyton in his book (Les Teignes) in 1910 which was based on his observation in artificial culture. The sexual state of dermatophyte was described by Nannizzi (1927). Emmons (1934) first reported the classification of dermatophytes based on vegetative structures and conidia. Gentles (1958) established the successful treatment of tinea capitis with griseofulvin.","Samanta, Indranil",Veterinary Mycology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122059/,650
42576,Phylogenetic and whole genome analysis of first seven SARS-CoV-2 isolates in Bangladesh,2020-11-26,"The outbreak of the novel coronavirus clearly highlights the importance of the need of effective physical examination scheduling. As treatment times for patients are uncertain, this remains a strongly NP-hard problem. Therefore, we introduce a complex flexible job shop scheduling model. In the process of physical examination for suspected patients, the physical examiner is considered a job, and the physical examination item and equipment correspond to an operation and a machine, respectively. We incorporate the processing time of the patient during the physical examination, the transportation time between equipment, and the setup time of the patient. A unique scheduling algorithm, called imperialist competition algorithm with global search strategy (ICA_GS) is developed for solving the physical examination scheduling problem. A local search strategy is embedded into ICA_GS for enhancing the searching behaviors, and a global search strategy is investigated to prevent falling into local optimality. Finally, the proposed algorithm is tested by simulating the execution of the physical examination scheduling processes, which verify that the proposed algorithm can better solve the physical examination scheduling problem.","Yu, Hui; Li, Jun-qing; Zhang, Lijing; Duan, Peng",Appl Intell,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7680665/,650
44843,Double lock of a potent human therapeutic monoclonal antibody against SARS-CoV-2,2020-12-18,"BACKGROUND: Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis are of the major health concern worldwide. Assessment of liver fibrosis is necessary to determine disease severity and prognosis at the time of presentation to determine suitable treatment. Liver biopsy is considered as standard golden method in diagnosis of liver fibrosis. However, this procedure is invasive; thus, multiple laboratory and radiologic tests are used to help determination of the degree of fibrosis. Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15) is a pleiotropic cytokine involved in regulating inflammatory and apoptotic pathways. It is suggested that GDF-15 plays an important role in pathogenesis of liver fibrosis. In this study, we aimed to evaluate efficiency of growth differentiation factor 15 in diagnosing liver fibrosis. The study was a case-control study conducted on 55 chronic HCV patients recruited from hepatitis C virus clinic at Faculty of Medicine Ain Shams Research Institute (MASRI), and 30 healthy subjects age- and sex-matched. The patients were classified into three subgroups according to the degree of liver fibrosis assessed by fibro-scan. Serum concentration of GDF-15 was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Our results revealed a highly significant statistical rise in GDF-15 levels among studied chronic HCV patients with liver fibrosis when compared to the control group (p < 0.01). Furthermore, there was a significant positive correlation between the degree of fibrosis assessed by fibro-scan and GDF-15 serum levels. Levels of GDF-15 were significantly higher in patients with mild degree of fibrosis (patients’ subgroup І) when compared with the controls’ group (p < 0.01) suggesting the role of this marker in early detection of liver fibrosis. A statistically significant increase in serum GDF-15 levels was noticed among patients with advanced fibrosis “subgroup ІІІ” compared to those with mild fibrosis “subgroup І” (p < 0.05). The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of GDF-15 were 96.7%, 98.2%, respectively at a cut-off value of 150 ng/L for discrimination between patients’ and controls’ groups. CONCLUSION: Growth differentiation factor 15 could be a potential marker of liver fibrosis especially in early detection as its levels were significantly higher in patients’ group with liver fibrosis than controls’ group and there was a significant positive correlation between the degree of liver fibrosis and GDF-15 serum levels.","Abou Zaghla, Heba M.

46631,Comparative sequence analysis of SARS-CoV-2 suggests its high transmissibility and pathogenicity,2021-03-08,"In many regulated industries there is an increasing pressure to provide timely and robust risk assessment data to support product launches. Real-time cell analysis (RTCA) is a tool that allows for the fast and relatively labour-free cytotoxic assessment of test compounds, compared to traditional methods. Here, we propose an application for the RTCA platform to provide a screening approach, to evaluate the cytotoxic potential of tobacco-free nicotine pouches, also termed modern oral product (MOP), to determine the contribution of differing nicotine strengths (4−11 mg) and a range of available flavour types from multiple markets, on overall product toxicity. Aqueous extracts were prepared for all products using 1 pouch in 20 mL cell culture media and applied to the cell system for 24 h. Test extract nicotine concentrations reflected the increases in product nicotine strength; however, these changes were not present in the same magnitude in the cytotoxicity data obtained from both primary human gingival fibroblasts (HGF) and an NCI-H292 human bronchial epithelial continuous cell line. Furthermore, across the range of flavours and product nicotine strengths tested, H292 cells whilst not the target organ for oral product use, accurately predicted the results seen in HGFs and could be considered a useful surrogate for fast screening studies. H292 cells are more easily cultured and for longer periods, offering a more compatible test system. In conclusion, the data demonstrate the utility of the RTCA platform for the quick assessment of a large range of product variants. Furthermore, for a cytotoxicity measure with this test product, the simple H292 cell line can predict outcomes in the more complex HGF and provide useful pre-clinical cytotoxicity screening data to inform the risk assessment of MOPs and the relative contribution of flavourings, nicotine and other components.","East, N.; Bishop, E.; Breheny, D.; Gaca, M.; Thorne, D.",Toxicol Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7933807/,650

It aimed to investigate the characteristics and effectiveness of teacher feedback on online business English presentations and also to explore EFL learners’ attitudes toward teacher feedback. The participants were one class of 24 sophomores majoring in Business English. By analyzing data from transcriptions of teacher feedback on presentation rehearsals, assessment scores, questionnaires, and students’ self-reflective journals, the study found that teacher feedback was focused on both content- and delivery-related components, but new sub-components were added to delivery-related teacher feedback, such as technology use, timing, and teamwork. It also proved the positive effect of teacher feedback on improving students’ oral presentation quality in various aspects. Additionally, it was found the participants held quite positive attitudes toward teacher feedback. However, some issues also arose in an online learning context. Therefore, pedagogical implications were provided based on the research findings and in response to the challenges of online education.","Xu, Qi; Chen, Shizhuo; Wang, Jiamin; Suhadolc, Stacy",Asia-Pacific Edu Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8173505/,650

It includes disaggregation of the demand into several categories, forecasting, elastic demand simulation, and a mathematical programming model with concave quadratic objective function and linear constraints for dynamic price optimization. The approach is computationally efficient and easy to implement. In computer experiments with a hotel data set, the hotel revenue is increased by about 6% on average in comparison with the actual revenue gained in a past period, where the fixed price policy was employed, subject to an assumption that the demand can deviate from the suggested elastic model. The approach and the developed software can be a useful tool for small hotels recovering from the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bandalouski, Andrei M.; Egorova, Natalja G.; Kovalyov, Mikhail Y.; Pesch, Erwin; Tarim, S.

But, deviating attention of health services towards emergency pandemic situation has resulted in strained health systems and interruptions in humanitarian response leading to eroding access to essential and often life-saving nutrition services. Therefore, optimal breast feeding practices are at risk due to infected mothers’ isolation practices, exhausted public health system and misbeliefs among the community (2). This finds out how Sri Lanka plans to maintain high standards of breast feeding in pandemic situation. METHODS: We searched for the publications on breast feeding, Sri Lanka in pandemic situation from January 2020 to date. RESULTS: As a low and middle income country with an unbeatable public health system, Sri Lanka has already issued an interim guideline for public health staff in continuation maternal and child care services (3). It ensures domiciliary visits by public health midwives (PHMs), although the clinic based teaching sessions on breast feeding have been cancelled. Community awareness has been created that no evidence of transmission of SARS COV-2 via breast milk is available and how the benefits of breast feeding outweigh the risk of infection (4). It is recommended that breast feeding shouldn't be interrupted at all and hand hygienic practices before touching the baby are ideal. Infected mothers can wear a protective mask and rooming in, and kangaroo mother care should be practiced. Sri Lanka already had guidelines on ensuring adequate and appropriate infant feeding guidelines in emergency situations (5). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the challenges faced by community and public health staff, Sri Lanka make efforts to maintain the achieved breast feeding standards. Further studies are needed to assess the impact of the pandemic on breast feeding practices in near future.

55062,The Identification of Natural Products that are Predicted to Bind to the SARS‐CoV‐2 3CL Protease,2021-05-14,"The early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) can allow patients to take preventive measures before irreversible brain damage occurs. It can be seen from cross-sectional imaging studies of AD that the features of the lesion areas in AD patients, as observed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), show significant variation, and these features are distributed throughout the image space. Since the convolutional layer of the general convolutional neural network (CNN) cannot satisfactorily extract long-distance correlation in the feature space, a deep residual network (ResNet) model, based on spatial transformer networks (STN) and the non-local attention mechanism, is proposed in this study for the early diagnosis of AD. In this ResNet model, a new Mish activation function is selected in the ResNet-50 backbone to replace the Relu function, STN is introduced between the input layer and the improved ResNet-50 backbone, and a non-local attention mechanism is introduced between the fourth and the fifth stages of the improved ResNet-50 backbone. This ResNet model can extract more information from the layers by deepening the network structure through deep ResNet. The introduced STN can transform the spatial information in MRI images of Alzheimer’s patients into another space and retain the key information. The introduced non-local attention mechanism can find the relationship between the lesion areas and normal areas in the feature space. This model can solve the problem of local information loss in traditional CNN and can extract the long-distance correlation in feature space. The proposed method was validated using the ADNI (Alzheimer’s disease neuroimaging initiative) experimental dataset, and compared with several models. The experimental results show that the classification accuracy of the algorithm proposed in this study can reach 97.1%, the macro precision can reach 95.5%, the macro recall can reach 95.3%, and the macro F1 value can reach 95.4%. The proposed model is more effective than other algorithms.","Sun, Haijing; Wang, Anna; Wang, Wenhui; Liu, Chen",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8235495/,650

Police officers are a particular subpopulation group that is at an increased risk for mental health problems. This study examined the prevalence of depression, suicidality and associated risk factors among police officers in urban Tanzania. AIMS: The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence of depression, suicidality and associated risk factors among police officers in Tanzania. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted between April 2019 and October 2020 among 550 participants in Dar es Salaam recruited using a multistage cluster sampling technique. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 was used to screen for depression and suicidality. The Interpersonal Support Evaluation List-12 tool was used to measure perceived social support. Descriptive statistics were summarised using frequencies and percentages. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to establish associations between predictors of interest, depression and suicidality. RESULTS: There were 497 participants in the study. Of these, 76.6% (376 of 491) were men, and the median (IQR) age was 37.0 (17) years. Around 19.8% (96 of 486) of the police officers screened positive for depression and 15.4% (75 of 413) for suicidality. A significant proportion was either moderately (29 of 96, 30.2%) or severely depressed (8 of 75, 10.7 %). Of those who experienced suicidal thoughts, 10.7% (8 of 75) reported having daily suicidal thoughts. Perceiving low social support was associated with an increased risk of reporting depression (adjusted OR (aOR): 28.04, 95% CI: 8.42 to 93.37, p<0.001) and suicidality (aOR: 10.85, 95% CI: 3.56 to 33.08, p<0.001) as compared with those with high perceived social support. CONCLUSION: The magnitude of depression and suicidality among police officers in urban Tanzania is alarmingly high. The study findings indicate the need for routine screening for depression and suicidality among police officers and design appropriate mental health responsive services in this population.","Njiro, Belinda Jackson; Ndumwa, Harrieth Peter; Msenga, Charles Joseph; Kawala, Thomas; Matola, Ezekiel; Mhonda, Juhudi; Corbin, Hillary; Ubuguyu, Omary; Likindikoki, Samuel",Gen Psychiatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8204155/,650

METHODS The plasma levels of the spexin, kisspeptin, and galanin and metabolic parameters (body mass index, weight loss, % excess weight loss, body fat, fasting glucose, HbA1C, and cholesterol levels) were measured (baseline, 1 month, and 3 months) and correlated in thirty adult individuals with obesity (22 female and 8 male) after LSG. RESULTS The body mass index (BMI), body fat, fasting glucose, total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased, while high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and % EWL (excess weight loss) increased at 3 months after surgery. The plasma spexin levels increased at 3 months, kisspeptin levels increased at 1 month and stabilized afterward, and galanin levels decreased at 3 months after LSG. Significant correlations were found between metabolic parameters with spexin, kisspeptin, and galanin. In addition, spexin and kisspeptin were negatively correlated with galanin, while spexin was positively correlated with kisspeptin. CONCLUSIONS The biochemical data reveal evidence that LSG causes an increase in the levels of spexin, and kisspeptin and a decrease in galanin levels.

64940,Quantification of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody by a pseudotyped virus-based assay.,2020-09-25,"Obesity is a strong risk factor for cancer progression, posing obesity-related cancer as one of the leading causes of death. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms that endow cancer cells with metastatic properties in patients affected by obesity remain unexplored.Here, we show that IL-6 and HGF, secreted by tumor neighboring visceral adipose stromal cells (V-ASCs), expand the metastatic colorectal (CR) cancer cell compartment (CD44v6 + ), which in turn secretes neurotrophins such as NGF and NT-3, and recruits adipose stem cells within tumor mass. Visceral adipose-derived factors promote vasculogenesis and the onset of metastatic dissemination by activation of STAT3, which inhibits miR-200a and enhances ZEB2 expression, effectively reprogramming CRC cells into a highly metastatic phenotype. Notably, obesity-associated tumor microenvironment provokes a transition in the transcriptomic expression profile of cells derived from the epithelial consensus molecular subtype (CMS2) CRC patients towards a mesenchymal subtype (CMS4). STAT3 pathway inhibition reduces ZEB2 expression and abrogates the metastatic growth sustained by adipose-released proteins. Together, our data suggest that targeting adipose factors in colorectal cancer patients with obesity may represent a therapeutic strategy for preventing metastatic disease.","Di Franco, Simone; Bianca, Paola; Sardina, Davide Stefano; Turdo, Alice; Gaggianesi, Miriam; Veschi, Veronica; Nicotra, Annalisa; Mangiapane, Laura Rosa; Lo Iacono, Melania; Pillitteri, Irene; van Hooff, Sander; Martorana, Federica; Motta, Gianmarco; Gulotta, Eliana; Lentini, Vincenzo Luca; Martorana, Emanuele; Fiori, Micol Eleonora; Vieni, Salvatore; Bongiorno, Maria Rita; Giannone, Giorgio; Giuffrida, Dario; Memeo, Lorenzo; Colarossi, Lorenzo; Mare, Marzia; Vigneri, Paolo; Todaro, Matilde; De Maria, Ruggero; Medema, Jan Paul; Stassi, Giorgio",Nature communications,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-25333-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34408135/,650

Owing to their convenience and effectiveness, these adhesives have received growing attention particularly in minimally invasive procedures. For safe and accurate applications, tissue adhesives should be detectable via clinical imaging modalities and be highly biocompatible for intracorporeal procedures. However, few adhesives meet all these requirements. Herein, we show that biocompatible tantalum oxide/silica core/shell nanoparticles (TSNs) exhibit not only high contrast effects for real-time imaging but also strong adhesive properties. Furthermore, the biocompatible TSNs cause much less cellular toxicity and less inflammation than a clinically used, imageable tissue adhesive (that is, a mixture of cyanoacrylate and Lipiodol).

Randomized controlled trials examining the effects of a driving intervention among older adults ≥ 50 years of age were included. Thirty-one studies were identified using a systematic literature review, and 26 were included in meta-analyses. The following types of driving interventions were identified: physical retraining/exercise (e.g., flexibility and coordination training); visual-perceptual training (e.g., improving figure-ground discrimination); cognitive training (e.g., Useful Field of View cognitive training); education (e.g., classroom driver refresher course); context-specific training (i.e., on-road training in car, driving simulator training); combined intervention approaches (e.g., education and context-specific training combined). Effect sizes were calculated for each driving intervention type relative to control groups using random-effects. Physical retraining/exercise, visual-perceptual training, and combined intervention approaches demonstrated medium to large effects on on-road driving performance, ds = 0.564-1.061, ps < .050. Cognitive training approaches reduced at-fault crashes by almost 30 %, OR = 0.729, 95 % CI [0.553, 0.962], p = .026. Education and context-specific approaches were not efficacious to improve driving safety outcomes, ps> .050. In summary, skill-specific interventions (physical retraining/exercise, visual-perceptual training, cognitive training) and combined intervention approaches improved on-road driving performance and reduced at-fault crashes. Optimizing interventions that target age-related functional declines and combined intervention approaches is recommended.","Fausto, Bernadette A; Adorno Maldonado, Pedro F; Ross, Lesley A; Lavallière, Martin; Edwards, Jerri D",Accident; analysis and prevention,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aap.2020.105852; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33142161/,650
72897,Synonymous and Biased Codon Usage by MERS CoV Papain-Like and 3CL-Proteases.,2017,"Galectin-1 is an important immunoregulatory factor and can mediate the host-pathogen interaction via binding glycans on the surface of various viruses. We previously reported that avian respiratory viruses, including lentogenic Newcastle disease virus (NDV), can induce up-regulation of chicken galectin (CG)-1B in the primary target organ. In this study, we investigated whether CG-1B participated in the infectious process of NDV in chickens. We demonstrated that velogenic NDV induced up-regulation of CG-1B in target organs. We also found that CG-1B directly bound to NDV virions and inhibited their hemagglutination activity in vitro We confirmed that CG-1B interacted with NDV hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) glycoprotein, in which the specific G4 N-glycans significantly contributed to the interaction between CG-1B and HN glycoprotein. The presence of extracellular CG-1B, rather than the internalization process, inhibited adsorption of NDV. The interaction between intracellular CG-1B and NDV HN glycoproteins inhibited cell-surface expression of HN glycoprotein and reduced the titer of progeny virus in NDV-infected DF-1 cells. Significantly, the replication of parental and HN glycosylation mutant viruses in CG-1B knockdown and overexpression cells demonstrated that the replication of NDV was correlated with the expression of CG-1B in a specific glycan-dependent manner. Collectively, our results indicate that CG-1B has anti-NDV activity by binding to N-glycans on HN glycoprotein.","Sun, Junfeng; Han, Zongxi; Qi, Tianming; Zhao, Ran; Liu, Shengwang",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m116.772897; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28978647/,650
75339,On the Origin of SARS-CoV-2: Did Cell Culture Experiments Lead to Increased Virulence of the Progenitor Virus for Humans?,2021,"Preterm and small-for-gestational-age (SGA) neonates are vulnerable groups that are susceptible to various microbial infections. Vγ9Vδ2-T cells are critical components of the host immune system and have been demonstrated to play an important role in the defense against viral infection in adults. However, the characteristics of Vγ9Vδ2-T cells in children, especially the preterm and SGA populations, are poorly understood. Here, we examined the frequency and antiviral function of Vγ9Vδ2-T cells in neonates, including preterm, SGA and full-term babies. When compared to adults, neonates had a significantly lower percentage of Vγ9Vδ2-T cells in the blood. Upon influenza virus stimulation, neonatal Vγ9Vδ2-T cells, especially from preterm and SGA babies, showed markedly decreased and delayed antiviral cytokine responses than those of adults. In addition, the antiviral responses of neonatal Vγ9Vδ2-T cells were positively correlated with gestational age and birth weight. Finally, a weaker expansion of Vγ9Vδ2-T cells by isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) was shown in neonates than the expansion in adults. Our data suggest that the depressed antiviral activity and decreased frequency of Vγ9Vδ2-T cells may likely account for the high susceptibility to microbial infection in neonates, particularly in preterm and SGA babies. Improving Vγ9Vδ2-T-cell function of neonates may provide a new way to defend against virus infection.","Li, Jinrong; Li, Hong; Mao, Huawei; Yu, Meixing; Feng, Ting; Yang, Fan; Fan, Yingying; Lu, Qiao; Shen, Chongyang; Yin, Zhongwei; Tu, Wenwei; Mao, Meng",Cellular & molecular immunology,https://doi.org/10.1038/cmi.2012.78; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23524656/,650

Objective: To compare chest CT features of COVID-19, influenza, and OP using a multireader design, and to assess radiologists' performance in distinguishing between these conditions. Methods: This retrospective study included 150 chest CT examinations in 150 patients (mean age 58±16 years) with diagnosis of COVID-19, influenza, or non-infectious OP (50 randomly selected abnormal CT examinations per diagnosis). Six thoracic radiologists independently assessed CT examinations for 14 individual CT findings and Radiologic Society of North America (RSNA) COVID-19 category and recorded a favored diagnosis. CT characteristics of the three diagnoses were compared using random effects models; readers' diagnostic performance was assessed. Results: COVID-19 pneumonia was significantly different (p<.05) from influenza pneumonia for seven of 14 chest CT findings, though different (p<.05) from OP for 4 of 14 findings [central or diffuse distribution in 10% and 7% of COVID-19 vs 20% and 21% of OP; unilateral distribution in 1% of COVID-19 vs 7% of OP; non-tree-in-bud nodules in 32% of COVID-19 vs 53% of OP; tree-in-bud nodules in 6% of COVID-19 vs 14% of OP]. A total of 70% of cases of COVID-19, 33% of influenza, and 47% of OP had an RSNA COVID-19 category of typical (p<.001). Mean percentage of correct favored diagnoses compared to actual diagnoses was 44% for COVID-19, 29% for influenza, and 39% for OP. Mean diagnostic accuracy of favored diagnoses was 70% for COVID-19 pneumonia and 68% for both influenza and OP. Conclusion: CT findings of COVID-19 substantially overlap with influenza and, to a greater extent, with OP. Radiologists' diagnostic accuracy was low in a study sample containing equal proportions of these three types of pneumonia. Clinical Impact: Recognized challenges in diagnosing COVID-19 by CT are furthered by our observed strong overlap between CT appearances of COVID-19 and OP. This challenge may be particularly evident in clinical settings with substantial proportions of patients with potential causes of OP such as ongoing cancer therapy or autoimmune conditions.","Garrana, Sherief H; Som, Avik; Ndakwah, Gabrielle S; Yeung, Tristan; Febbo, Jennifer; Heeger, Allen P; Lang, Min; McDermott, Shaunagh; Mendoza, Dexter P; Zhang, Eric W; Sharma, Amita; Narayan, Anand K; Little, Brent P",AJR.

77058,The Role of the SARS-CoV-2 S-Protein Glycosylation in the Interaction of SARS-CoV-2/ACE2 and Immunological Responses.,2021-02-19,"BACKGROUND Flow control during endovascular stroke treatment with stent-retrievers is crucial for successful revascularization. The standard technique recommended by stent-retriever manufacturers implies obstruction of the respective access catheter by the microcatheter, through which the stent-retriever is delivered. This, in turn, results in reduced aspiration during thrombectomy. In order to maximize aspiration, we fully retract the microcatheter out of the access catheter before thrombectomy-an approach we term the 'bare wire thrombectomy' (BWT) technique. We verified the improved throughput with systematic in vitro studies and assessed the clinical effectiveness and safety of this method. METHODS We compared aspiration flow of water through various access catheters (5-8 F) with a Rebar microcatheter (0.18 inch and 0.27 inch) and a Trevo stent-retriever using the standard technique and the BWT technique in vitro. We also retrospectively analyzed 302 retrieval maneuvers in 117 patients who received endovascular treatment with a stent-retriever between February 2010 and April 2015. RESULTS In the in vitro experiment, removal of the microcatheter in all tested settings resulted in significantly increased aspiration flow through the access catheter (p<0.001). This effect was particularly pronounced in access catheters with a diameter of ≤7 F. In the clinical study, the revascularization rate (Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction ≥2b) was 91%. There were no complications associated with the BWT technique in 302 retrieval maneuvers. CONCLUSIONS The BWT technique results in improved aspiration flow rates compared with the standard deployment technique. Our clinical data show that the BWT technique is effective and safe.","Nikoubashman, Omid; Alt, Jan Patrick; Nikoubashman, Arash; Büsen, Martin; Heringer, Sarah; Brockmann, Carolin; Brockmann, Marc-Alexander; Müller, Marguerite; Reich, Arno; Wiesmann, Martin",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2016-012319; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27084962/,650

In this study, we characterize the impact of the lockdown associated with the pandemic on air quality in six major cities across the state of Florida, namely: Jacksonville, Tallahassee, Gainesville, Orlando, Tampa, and Miami. Hourly measurements of PM2.5, ozone, NO2, SO2, and CO were provided by the US EPA at thirty sites operated by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection during mid-February to mid-April from 2015 through 2020. To analyze the effect of the pandemic, atmospheric pollutant concentrations in 2020 were compared to historic data at these cities during the same period from 2015 to 2019. Reductions in NO2 and CO levels were observed across the state in most cities and were attributed to restrictions in mobility and the decrease in vehicle usage amid the lockdown. Likewise, decreases in O3 concentrations were observed and were related to the prevailing NOx-limited regime during this time period. Changes in concentrations of SO2 exhibited spatial variations, concentrations decreased in northern cities, however an increase was observed in central and southern cities, likely due to increased power generation at facilities primarily in the central and southern regions of the state. PM2.5 levels varied temporally during the study and were positively correlated with SO2 concentrations during the lockdown. In March, reductions in PM2.5 levels were observed, however elevations in PM2.5 concentrations in April were attributed to long-range transport of pollutants rather than local emissions. This study provides further insight into the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on anthropogenic sources from vehicular emissions and power generation in Florida. This work has implications for policies and regulations of vehicular emissions as well as consequences on the use of sustainable energy sources in the state.","El-Sayed, Marwa M H; Elshorbany, Yasin F; Koehler, Kirsten",Environmental pollution,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.117451; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34082371/,650

We show that separately functional, translational, and transcriptional controllers cannot generally be combined without extensive redesign. We analyze candidate architectures for direct design of dual resource allocation controllers and propose modifications to improve their performance (in terms of decoupling and expression level) and robustness.

Clinical syndromes resulting from FIV infection include immunodeficiency, opportunistic infections, and neoplasia. In our study, a 5' long terminal repeat/gag region-based reverse transcription insulated isothermal polymerase chain reaction (RT-iiPCR) was developed to amplify all known FIV strains to facilitate point-of-need FIV diagnosis. The RT-iiPCR method was applied in a point-of-need PCR detection platform--a field-deployable device capable of generating automatically interpreted RT-iiPCR results from nucleic acids within 1 hr. Limit of detection 95% of FIV RT-iiPCR was calculated to be 95 copies standard in vitro transcription RNA per reaction. Endpoint dilution studies with serial dilutions of an ATCC FIV type strain showed that the sensitivity of lyophilized FIV RT-iiPCR reagent was comparable to that of a reference nested PCR. The established reaction did not amplify any nontargeted feline pathogens, including Felid herpesvirus 1, feline coronavirus, Feline calicivirus, Feline leukemia virus, Mycoplasma haemofelis, and Chlamydophila felis. Based on analysis of 76 clinical samples (including blood and bone marrow) with the FIV RT-iiPCR, test sensitivity was 97.78% (44/45), specificity was 100.00% (31/31), and agreement was 98.65% (75/76), determined against a reference nested-PCR assay. A kappa value of 0.97 indicated excellent correlation between these 2 methods.

We aimed to evaluate the effects of ARBs/ACEIs on COVID-19 in a retrospective, single-center study. 126 COVID-19 patients with preexisting hypertension at Hubei Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine (HPHTCM) in Wuhan from January 5 to February 22, 2020 were retrospectively allocated to ARBs/ACEIs group (n=43) and non-ARBs/ACEIs group (n=83) according to their antihypertensive medication. 125 age- and sex-matched COVID-19 patients without hypertension were randomly selected as non-hypertension controls. In addition, the medication history of 1942 hypertension patients that were admitted to HPHTCM from November 1 to December 31, 2019 before COVID-19 outbreak were also reviewed for external comparison. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical and laboratory data were collected, analyzed and compared between these groups. The frequency of ARBs/ACEIs usage in hypertension patients with or without COVID-19 were comparable. Among COVID-19 patients with hypertension, those received either ARBs/ACEIs or non-ARBs/ACEIs had comparable blood pressure. However, ARBs/ACEIs group had significantly lower concentrations of CRP (p=0.049) and procalcitonin (PCT, p=0.008). Furthermore, a lower proportion of critical patients (9.3% vs 22.9%; p=0.061), and a lower death rate (4.7% vs 13.3%; p=0.216) were observed in ARBs/ACEIs group than non-ARBs/ACEIs group, although these differences failed to reach statistical significance. Our findings thus support the use of ARBs/ACEIs in COVID-19 patients with preexisting hypertension.","Yang, Guang; Tan, Zihu; Zhou, Ling; Yang, Min; Peng, Lang; Liu, Jinjin; Cai, Jingling; Yang, Ru; Han, Junyan; Huang, Yafei; He, Shaobin",Hypertension,https://doi.org/10.1161/hypertensionaha.120.15143; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32348166/,650

The objective of this study was to compare EAdi, EA of the scalene (EAscal), and EA of the alae nasi (EAan), according to the ventilatory mode and assist level in 12 mechanically ventilated patients. METHODS Seven assist levels of pressure support ventilation (PSV) and NAVA were sequentially applied. EAdi, EAscal, and EAan were quantified and expressed as a percentage of their maximum values. The relative contributions of extradiaphragmatic muscles to inspiratory efforts were assessed by calculating EAscal/EAdi and EAan/EAdi ratios. Three assist levels for each of the two ventilatory modes that resulted in EAdi values of 80 to 100%, 60 to 80%, and 40 to 60% were assigned to three groups (N1, N2, and N3). Results are expressed as median and interquartile range. RESULTS EA of inspiratory muscles decreased during PSV and NAVA (P < 0.0001). Although EAdi remained constant within groups (P = 0.9), EAscal was reduced during NAVA compared with PSV in N1 and N3 (65% [62 to 64] and 27% [18 to 34] in NAVA vs. 90% [81 to 100] and 49% [40 to 55] in PSV, P = 0.007). Altogether, EAscal/EAdi and EAan/EAdi ratios were lower in NAVA than PSV (0.7 [0.6 to 0.7] and 0.7 [0.6 to 0.8] in NAVA vs. 0.9 [0.8 to 1.1] and 0.9 [0.7 to 1.1] in PSV, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS NAVA and PSV both reduced extradiaphragmatic inspiratory muscle activity, in proportion to the level of assistance.

However, it is difficult to comprehend the scale, in sequence space, geographical location and time, at which SARS-CoV-2 mutates and evolves in its human hosts. To get an appreciation for the rapid evolution of the coronavirus, we built interactive scalable vector graphics maps that show daily nucleotide variations in genomes from the six most populated continents compared to that of the initial, ground-zero SARS-CoV-2 isolate sequenced at the beginning of the pandemic.

115798,SARS-CoV-2 Viral Variants-Tackling a Moving Target.,2021-02-11,"OBJECTIVES Etanercept, a tumor necrosis factor inhibitor, is an effective drug for patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and nitrotyrosine (NT) are pro-inflammatory biomolecules associated with satiety and increased body weight. We evaluated whether MCP-1 and NT are associated with decreased inflammation or increased body mass during etanercept therapy in active RA patients. METHODS RA patients with moderate to high disease activity were enrolled to receive add-on etanercept (25 mg subcutaneous injection, biweekly) for at least one year, combined with sustained treatment with conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs). RESULTS Forty patients received add-on etanercept and 15 received DMARDs alone. At the end of one year, etanercept significantly reduced the disease activity score of 28 joints, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Moreover, etanercept significantly increased the body weight, body mass index (BMI), as well as MCP-1 and NT levels, compared to that in the csDMARD-only group. CONCLUSIONS Increased serum MCP-1 and NT levels in RA patients with moderate to high disease activity, who underwent one-year etanercept treatment, might be attributed to increase in body weight and BMI rather than induction of more severe autoimmune inflammation.","Huang, Hsien-Hao; Chen, Liang-Yu; Chen, Kuan-Yang; Lee, Yu-Chi; Tsai, Chang-Youh; Chen, Chih-Yen",Neuropeptides,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.npep.2020.102100; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33142189/,650

In the beginning, the demand for hospitalization was low, but it increased gradually. Consistent with international reports, the majority of patients presented mild or moderate symptoms. Nonetheless, there were also severe cases, even fatal ones. Objectives To describe the characteristics and clinical outcome of pediatric patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in a referral hospital in Lima, Peru, between March and August 2020. Methods A descriptive and inferential cross-sectional study was carried out. The population includes all hospitalized patients in the Department of Pediatrics, with clinical and surgical diagnoses associated with COVID-19. Results We included 100 patients, with an average age of 83.4 ± 54 months, with a predominance of male patients (55%). Hospitalized patients were grouped into five categories: respiratory failure (17%), multisystemic inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) (31%), neurological presentation (19%), acute abdomen (20%), and patients with oncological problems (13%). Most of the patients (74%) had comorbidities. Regarding the presenting symptoms, intestinal pain predominated in the appendicitis group (90%, p < 0.001), fever was present in most patients with respiratory failure (64.7%); multisystemic inflammatory syndrome (90.3%), neurological manifestations (15.8%), acute abdomen (50%) and oncological conditions (61.5%) were also present in these patients. Kawasaki symptoms were found in 38.7% of the patients with multisystemic inflammatory syndrome. Mortality was 4%. Respiratory problems (29.4%) and multisystemic inflammatory syndrome (22.6%) required admission to intensive care, more frequently than the other presentations (p = 0.008). Conclusions We conclude that the vulnerability in the pediatric population is the one that has preexisting conditions. We divided our patients according to presentation, diagnosis, and complications, which were predominantly respiratory. We also had oncological patients with COVID-19.","Domínguez Rojas, Jesús; Estupiñan Vigil, Matilde; Garcés-Ghilardi, Raquel; Alvarado-Gamarra, Giancarlo; Del Águila, Olguita; Lope Tenorio, Adanida Flor; Ayón Dejo, Carmen Cecilia; Chonlon Murillo, Kenny; Boluarte Baca, Sebastián; Stapleton Herbozo, Angie; Seminario Aliaga, Ricardo; Reyes Florian, Giuliana; Dávila Riega, Diana; Fernández Suárez, Sarah; Coronado Muñoz, Álvaro",Medwave,https://doi.org/10.5867/medwave.2021.01.8107; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33617519/,650

METHODS This collaborative, multisite virtual health policy course used the Staged Self-Directed Learning Model (SSDL) to lead a diverse group of students studying health policy. Twelve Core sessions were offered with three additional sessions in August or December for a total of 15 total synchronous Zoom sessions that covered policy issues on supply, demand, and need for dental care. RESULTS Twenty-eight students, seven lead instructors, and two course directors from six schools reported positive feedback on the course format, use of technology and the SSDL model, and breadth of topics presented. Participation by universities in four states with differing health policies stimulated virtual classroom discussions. CONCLUSION In conclusion, collaborative interinstitutional virtual teaching and learning is cost effective, efficient, and engaging for students. This model has the potential to continue even when institutions are no longer affected by COVID-19.","Kennedy, Erinne N; Alex White, Benjamin; Weintraub, Jane A; Moss, Mark E; Jordan, Samantha L; Quick, Karin K; Ticku, Shenam; Huang, Boyen; Douglass, Chester",Journal of dental education,https://doi.org/10.1002/jdd.12650; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34060648/,650

126524,Adjusting Extracellular pH to Prevent Entry of SARS-CoV-2 into Human Cells.,2021-02-17,"BACKGROUND Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are the leading cause of work disability and sickness absence worldwide. The prevalence of MSDs increases with age, consequently challenging sustainable employability among the growing ageing workforce. Knowledge of feasible and efficient workplace-based interventions to rehabilitate MSD or prevent its consequences is therefore warranted. This systematic review will evaluate the effectiveness of workplace-based interventions on MSDs and its consequences among adult workers with physical and sedentary work tasks, respectively. METHODS We will search the following bibliographic databases: PubMed (including the database 'MEDLINE') and Web of Science Core Collection (including the databases 'Science Citation Index Expanded', 'Social Sciences Citation Index' and 'Arts & Humanities Citation Index'). Manual searches will also be performed. We will include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs reported in English in which (1) participants are adult workers with MSD, (2) interventions are aiming at rehabilitating pain symptoms of MSD or preventing the consequences of MSD and (3) interventions are initiated and/or carried out at the workplace. The review will adhere to the 'Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses' (PRISMA) guidelines for reporting systematic reviews and the Institute for Work and Health (IWH) guidelines for workplace-based interventions. For the primary evaluation of the review, the quality assessment and evidence synthesis will conform to the IWH guidelines. Secondary evaluation will include a meta-analysis (unless the included studies do not allow this due to heterogeneity) and employ the risk of bias domains recommended by Cochrane along with the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) approach on the studies with pain intensity as an outcome. DISCUSSION This systematic review will provide knowledge on effective workplace-based interventions among physical and sedentary workers with MSD. RCTs are considered the most powerful experimental design in clinical trials, but solely including these may be too restrictive to understand effective workplace-based interventions where randomised and carefully controlled trials (RCTs) are not always possible. In order to maximize practical relevance, the selection process will, therefore, include both RCTs and non-RCTs and the quality assessment and evidence synthesis will conform to IWH guidelines focusing on developing practical guidelines for stakeholders. The result of this work will form the basis for industry-specific evidence-based recommendations on effective workplace-based interventions for rehabilitation of MSDs and its consequences that will later be operationalised into concrete and user-friendly practical tools for workplaces.

However, the quantitative relationship between temperature change and extinction is unclear. Here, we analyze magnitudes and rates of temperature change and extinction rates of marine fossils through the past 450 million years (Myr). The results show that both the rate and magnitude of temperature change are significantly positively correlated with the extinction rate of marine animals. Major mass extinctions in the Phanerozoic can be linked to thresholds in climate change (warming or cooling) that equate to magnitudes >5.2 °C and rates >10 °C/Myr. The significant relationship between temperature change and extinction still exists when we exclude the five largest mass extinctions of the Phanerozoic. Our findings predict that a temperature increase of 5.2 °C above the pre-industrial level at present rates of increase would likely result in mass extinction comparable to that of the major Phanerozoic events, even without other, non-climatic anthropogenic impacts.","Song, Haijun; Kemp, David B; Tian, Li; Chu, Daoliang; Song, Huyue; Dai, Xu",Nature communications,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-25019-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34349121/,650

This approach to ""electro-physiological SE"" encompasses five dimensions of the IIC: it characterizes a periodic or rhythmic pattern, not only regarding its ictal morphology and potential harm with secondary neuronal injury, but also addresses the ""metabolic footprint,"" clinical repercussion, and epileptogenic potential. Recent studies have attempted to determine and qualify the ictal nature and the epileptogenic potential (i.e., risk of subsequent acute seizures) of particular IIC patterns and their intrinsic EEG characteristics. Others have correlated non-convulsive seizures with cognitive outcomes beyond mortality; non-convulsive seizures and sporadic, periodic, or rhythmic discharges to encephalopathy severity; and the spectrum of periodic or rhythmic patterns to measurable secondary brain injury. Equivocal periodic or rhythmic patterns on the IIC are frequently encountered in critical care neurology where clinicians often incorporate advanced neuroimaging, metabolic neuromonitoring, and anti-seizure drug short trials, in an effort to gauge these patterns. We propose portraying the IIC with a multiaxial graph to disambiguate each of these risks. Quantification along each axis may help calibrate therapeutic urgency. An adaptable scoring system assesses which quasi-ictal EEG patterns in this spectrum might reach the tipping point toward anti-seizure drug escalation, in neurocritically ill patients.","Kapinos, Gregory; Trinka, Eugen; Kaplan, Peter W",Journal of clinical neurophysiology : official publication of the American Electroencephalographic Society,https://doi.org/10.1097/wnp.0000000000000468; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29979290/,650

We draw on a number of key sources, including key papers and book chapters, discussion forums, agency reports, and conference presentations. We develop the potential dimensions of patient-based evidence, describe its key attributes, and consider its future development. Patient-based evidence has the potential to be a key concept in HTA, comprised of a series of related elements of importance to patients. We recognize that we raise more questions than can be answered, but as an emerging concept, recognition and understanding of patient-based evidence is still developing. The concepts and methods that support its application in HTA require urgent development. We conclude that clinical and economic forms of evidence are not enough for HTA. For HTA to be complete, we need to consider all relevant aspects of the phenomena, including patient-based evidence. There is now an urgent need for the global research and HTA community to work together to realize the full potential of patient-based evidence through conceptual and methodological development and wider recognition.

A literature overview and implications for SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics and future viral outbreaks.,2020-10-08,"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is currently being performed with increasing frequency worldwide. It offers an excellent weight loss and resolution of comorbidities in the short term with a very low incidence of complications. However, the ever present risk of a staple line leak is still a major concern. METHODS Since 2005, data from obese patients that undergo bariatric procedures in Germany are prospectively registered in an online database and analyzed at the Institute of Quality Assurance in Surgical Medicine. For the current analysis, all patients that had undergone primary sleeve gastrectomy for morbid obesity within a 7-year period were considered. RESULTS Using the GBSR, data from 5.400 LSGs were considered for analysis. Staple line leak rate decreased during the study period from 6.5 to 1.4 %. Male gender, higher BMI, concomitant sleep apnea, conversion to laparotomy, longer operation time, use of both buttresses and oversewing, and the occurrence of intraoperative complications were associated with a significantly higher leakage rate. On multivariate analysis, operation time and year of procedure only had a significant impact on staple line leak rate. CONCLUSIONS The results of the current study demonstrated that there are factors that increase the risk of a leakage which would enable surgeons to define risk groups, to more carefully select patients, and to offer a closer follow-up during the postoperative course with early recognition and adequate treatment. All future efforts should be focused on a further reduction of serious complications to make the LSG a widely accepted and safer procedure.","Benedix, Frank; Benedix, Diana D; Knoll, Christian; Weiner, Rudolf; Bruns, Christiane; Manger, Thomas; Stroh, Christine",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-014-1257-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24748473/,650

Diagnosis is often delayed or missed. Overall mortality is about 20%. This feared high mortality rate has led to the misconception that primary esophageal repair should be avoided in late diagnosed patients. We report a successful primary repair of spontaneous esophageal rupture which was delayed for more than two weeks. METHODS A 53 year-old male presented to our medical service after falsely having been treated for pneumonia at an outside hospital. He was subsequently diagnosed with spontaneous esophageal rupture and treated with over the scope clips followed by stenting. Persistent leak into mediastinum made surgical exploration necessary. At exploration a primary repair could be performed successfully. RESULTS Unsuccessful endoscopic management of esophageal perforation that was delayed for two weeks underwent primary surgical repair without complications. CONCLUSION Primary closure of late diagnosed spontaneous esophageal rupture can be successful, even when it is complicated by a prolonged delay in treatment and failed endoscopic procedures.

METHODS We used the depression-anxiety-stress scale and self-designed questionnaire on professional pride, intention to work in the front-line and the extent of family support. Medical students from 4 medical schools in Fujian and Hunan were investigated. Their mental health status, professional pride and first-line work willingness with different characteristics were compared, and the influential factors for professional pride and first-line work willingness were analyzed. RESULTS A total of 266 valid questionnaires were collected. During the pandemic, there were significant differences in the proportion of depressed students among different college and universities, majors and stages (P<0.05), and the professional pride was significantly different (P<0.001). Medical students with different mental health status showed significant differences in professional pride (P<0.01). Marriage, pressure and extent of family support were the influential factors for their professional pride (P<0.05). The latter two were also influential factors for their intention to work in the front-line (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS During the pandemic, students from college and nursing have relatively better mental health and higher professional pride.

We conducted a survey of Australian anesthesiologists to determine their attitudes toward, and how and why they use, DoA monitors. METHODS A random sample of 963 anesthesiologists was invited to participate in an anonymous online survey. RESULTS The overall response rate was 30% (289 respondents). Twenty-nine percent (95% confidence interval, 24%-34%) of respondents thought DoA monitoring was indicated in all cases under relaxant general anesthesia. During total IV anesthesia with muscle relaxants, 74% of respondents (69%-79%) opined that DoA monitoring should be mandatory. DoA usage was never used by 5% of respondents (3%-8%), used in less than one-third of cases by 66% (61%-72%), and in more than one-third of cases by 29% (24%-35%). Belief in the usefulness of DoA monitoring for prevention of awareness was strongly associated with higher usage (P < 0.0001, Pearson correlation 0.32). Anesthesiologists were more influenced by higher DoA numbers than lower ones. In comparison with end-tidal anesthetic concentration monitoring, 30% (25%-35%) of respondents felt that DoA monitoring was more effective for prevention of intraoperative awareness. Thirty percent (25%-36%) of respondents reported having a previous case of awareness. CONCLUSIONS The relatively frequent use of DoA monitoring contrasts with patterns in the UK, suggesting greater acceptance by Australian anesthesiologists. ""Awareness prevention"" rather than ""recovery enhancement"" appears to be the primary driver in DoA monitoring use in Australia. Highly variable usage patterns of DoA monitoring in the context of the current body of evidence suggest the need for greater education on the appropriate use of these monitors.","Ben-Menachem, Erez; Zalcberg, Dave",Anesthesia and analgesia,https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0000000000000344; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25006849/,650

150934,Potent neutralizing antibodies directed to multiple epitopes on SARS-CoV-2 spike.,2020-07-22,"INTRODUCTION Corticosteroids are effective for inducing clinical remission in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but not for maintaining remission. Reducing corticosteroid use and dependence is an important treatment goal since their use is associated with adverse events. The extent to which the improvements in IBD therapy have led to less corticosteroid use in the modern era remains unclear. METHODS We used the University of Manitoba Inflammatory Bowel Disease Epidemiologic Database to assess the cumulative annual dosing of corticosteroids on a per-patient basis for all persons with IBD in the province of Manitoba between 1997 and 2017. Joinpoint analysis was used to assess for trends in corticosteroid use and to look at variation in the trends over time. RESULTS The mean annual exposure to corticosteroids decreased from 419 mg/yr (1997) to 169 mg/yr (2017) for Crohn's disease (CD) (annual decline: 3.8% per year, 95% confidence interval 3.1-4.6) and from 380 to 240 mg/yr in ulcerative colitis (UC) (annual decline: 2.5% per year, 95% confidence interval 2.1-2.8). In CD, there was an acceleration in the rate of decline after 2007 (pre-2007, 1.9% decline per year; after 2007, 5.7% per year); there was no corresponding acceleration in the rate of decline in UC. DISCUSSION Corticosteroid use has decreased in both CD and UC over the past 2 decades, becoming more pronounced after 2007 in CD. Potential explanations include introduction and increasing penetrance of biologic therapy in CD and greater awareness of corticosteroid-related adverse events in IBD. Further work is required understand the drivers of persistent corticosteroid use in IBD and how this can be further reduced.","Targownik, Laura E; Bernstein, Charles N; Benchimol, Eric I; Kaplan, Gilaad G; Singh, Harminder; Tennakoon, Aruni; Nugent, Zoann; Coward, Stephanie B; Kuenzig, M Ellen; Murthy, Sanjay K",The American journal of gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.14309/ajg.0000000000001220; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33767103/,650

Significant impact of climate change is seen in the form of rise in temperature called as global warming. Carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) are the primary greenhouse gases (GHGs) mainly responsible for the global warming and climate change. These GHGs have drawn lot of attention due to their significant role in the global warming potential. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggested to stop global warming at 1.5oC above preindustrial levels as warming beyond this level might lead to heat extremes, alter insect and plant phenology (Phenological shifts) and more occurrence of vector borne diseases. Climate change is the topic of interest in all fields of life starting from social science and going to the applied science. Global climate cycles and world food production systems are under threat due to the recent climate extreme events. These events include heat waves and change in the rainfall patterns. Thus, risk reduction intervention in the form of mitigation and adaptation is required to minimize the impacts of climate change. Mitigation option includes understanding the present and future components of the climate system and interaction among them through coupled modeling system i.e. Global Circulation Model (GCM). Finally, global issue of climate change could be addressed by taking worldwide cooperation and action and adopting sustainable measures like use of alternative energy sources.

Cataract surgery is one of the most frequently performed operations worldwide, but good quality services are not universally available. This scoping review aims to summarise the nature and extent of published literature on interventions to improve the quality of services for age-related cataract globally. METHODS We used the dimensions of quality adopted by WHO-effectiveness, safety, people-centredness, timeliness, equity, integration and efficiency-to which we added planetary health. On 17 November 2019 we searched MEDLINE, Embase and Global Health for manuscripts published since 1990, without language or geographic restrictions. We included studies that reported quality-relevant interventions and excluded studies focused on technical aspects of surgery or that only involved children (less than 18 years). Screening of titles/abstracts, full-text review and data extraction were performed by two reviewers independently. Studies were grouped thematically and results synthesised narratively. RESULTS Most of the 143 included studies were undertaken in high-income countries (n=93, 65%); Twenty-nine intervention groups were identified, most commonly pre-operative education (n=17, 12%) and pain/anxiety management (n=16, 11%). Efficiency was the quality element most often assessed (n=58, 41%) followed by people-centredness (n=40, 28%), while integration (n=4) and timeliness (n=3) were infrequently reported, and no study reported outcomes related to planetary health. CONCLUSION Evidence on interventions to improve quality of cataract services shows unequal regional distribution. There is an urgent need for more evidence relevant to low- and middle- income countries as well as across all quality elements, including planetary health. This article is protected by copyright.

Different treatment modalities, including topical dressings, have yet to show consistent efficacy against wound biofilm. This study evaluates the impact of a novel, antimicrobial Test Dressing on Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm-infected wounds. Six-mm dermal punch wounds in rabbit ears were inoculated with 10(6) colony-forming units of P. aeruginosa. Biofilm was established in vivo using our published model. Dressing changes were performed every other day with either Active Control or Test Dressings. Treated and untreated wounds were harvested for several quantitative endpoints. Confirmatory studies were performed to measure treatment impact on in vitro P. aeruginosa and in vivo polybacterial wounds containing P. aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. The Test Dressing consistently decreased P. aeruginosa bacterial counts, and improved wound healing relative to Inactive Vehicle and Active Control wounds (p < 0.05). In vitro bacterial counts were also significantly reduced following Test Dressing therapy (p < 0.05). Similarly, improvements in bacterial burden and wound healing were also achieved in polybacterial wounds (p < 0.05). This study represents the first quantifiable and consistent in vivo evidence of a topical antimicrobial dressing's impact against established wound biofilm. The development of clinically applicable therapies against biofilm such as this is critical to improving chronic wound care.","Seth, Akhil K; Zhong, Aimei; Nguyen, Khang T; Hong, Seok J; Leung, Kai P; Galiano, Robert D; Mustoe, Thomas A",Wound repair and regeneration : official publication of the Wound Healing Society [and] the European Tissue Repair Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/wrr.12232; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25230854/,650

The World Health Organization has issued public advice to create awareness by providing people knowledge to prevent/protect them from COVID-19. Hence, the present study was planned to assess knowledge of prevention and its practical use amongst samples from the Saudi Arabian population. It can be used to bring awareness among the masses not only in expanding their knowledge about COVID-19 but also on how to enforce a practicing behavior in relation to the prevention of COVID-19. The study is among the pioneer studies on the issue related to knowledge and practice of the prevention of COVID-19 among Saudis and foreign nationals residing in Saudi Arabia. OBJECTIVE The prime objective of this study is to examine the existence of knowledge among the Saudi and non-Saudi nationals about COVID-19 and its impact on their behavior to practice the protocols to prevent the disastrous infection of COVID-19. This study has also examined how the residents in Saudi Arabia react to the methods and protection measures adopted by the government for their dominions to eradicate the spread of COVID-19. METHODOLOGY The study used a survey-based methodology and data was collected from Saudi nationals as well as expatriates living and working in five different regions of Saudi Arabia. Non-probability snowball sampling was used to reach and select the population of the current study. A self-designed, structured, and validated questionnaire was electronically distributed among the respondents. SPSS version 21 was used to analyze the data of the current study. RESULTS Out of the 443 respondents, 356 respondents (84%) knew they had to wash their hands for 20 seconds and did this as well, 303 respondents (75%) knew that sneezing or coughing into the arm/elbow can prevent the spread of COVID-19 and were doing this as well, 357 respondents (82%) knew that COVID-19 can be transferred by shaking hands and avoided this, 333 respondents (79%) knew that they had to maintain a safe distance of at least one meter and kept this distance, 315 respondents (76%) knew that touching one's face can transfer the virus and avoid this, and 414 respondents (95%) knew that staying at home can decrease the chances of getting infected. The relationship between different regions and most of the knowledge-based and practice-based questions was significant (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION Results reveal that there is a significant relationship between knowledge and practice, but the strength of association is weak. It was found that knowledge and practice of COVID-19 was followed differently in the five regions of Saudi Arabia and the level of education of the respondents influenced their choice of practice to protect themselves from the effects of COVID-19. The study has contributed in the body of literature by examining the inter-relationship between knowledge and practice and their use in prevention of COVID-19 among the Saudi population.","Siddiqui, Ammar Ahmed; Alshammary, Freah; Amin, Junaid; Rathore, Hassaan Anwer; Hassan, Ibne; Ilyas, Mohammad; Khursheed Alam, Mohammed",Work,https://doi.org/10.3233/wor-203223; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32925138/,650

Pathogenic LRRK2 phosphorylates a subset of Rab GTPases and blocks ciliogenesis. Thus, defining novel phospho-Rab interacting partners is critical to our understanding of the molecular basis of LRRK2 pathogenesis. RILPL2 binds with strong preference to LRRK2-phosphorylated Rab8A and Rab10. RILPL2 is a binding partner of the motor protein and Rab effector, Myosin Va. We show here that the globular tail domain of Myosin Va also contains a high affinity binding site for LRRK2-phosphorylated Rab10, and certain tissue-specific Myosin Va isoforms strongly prefer to bind phosphorylated Rab10. In the presence of pathogenic LRRK2, RILPL2 relocalizes to the peri-centriolar region in a phosphoRab10- and Myosin Va-dependent manner. In the absence of phosphoRab10, expression of RILPL2 or depletion of Myosin Va increase centriolar RILPL2 levels, and either condition is sufficient to block ciliogenesis in RPE cells. These experiments show that LRRK2 generated phosphoRab10 dramatically redistributes Myosin Va-RILPL2 complexes to the mother centriole, which may sequester Myosin Va and RILPL2 in a manner that blocks their normal roles in ciliogenesis.","Yanatori, Izumi; Dhekne, Herschel S.; Vides, Edmundo G.; Sobu, Yuriko; Diez, Federico; Pfeffer, Suzanne R.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.28.065664,650

Sri Lankan Buddhist communities face a variety of challenges which are also faced by other religious groups in Asia. These include avoiding close contact with co-worshippers, addressing economic depression among devotees and institutions, and managing the new legal and administrative restrictions proposed by government. Also, like other religious groups, Sri Lankan Buddhists have proposed their own range of religious solutions to the unfolding crisis. These include special forms of public blessing, social service activities, and alterations to public ceremonies and rituals. Looking at Buddhists’ responses to the Covid-19 pandemic in Sri Lanka illuminates not only the depth and extent of the disease’s impact on societies in Asia, but it also highlights the creative and unprecedented changes to religion that have come from the pandemic. © the several contributors 2021.","Schonthal, B.; Jayatilake, T.",Covid-19 in Asia: Law and Policy Contexts,https://doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780197553831.003.0018,650

167588,Visual Continuity of Protein Secondary Structure Rendering: Application to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in Virtual Reality,2021,"Background: In both the U.S. and U.K., after a period of decline, prevalence of cocaine use has been increasing since 2012 and is now the second leading cause of overdose death from an illicit drug. However, psychosocial treatments for cocaine use disorders are limited, and no pharmacotherapy is approved by regulatory bodies in the U.S. or Europe. We performed a comprehensive meta-analysis to assess treatments impacts on cocaine use. Methods: We performed a meta-analysis of clinical trials that included the word ""cocaine"" in the title and were published between 31/12/1995 and 31/12/2017. All studies of outpatient adults with active cocaine use and reporting urinalysis results were included. Treatment approaches were clustered into 11 categories. Missing data were imputed using multiple imputation by chained equations. We calculated intention-to-treat log-odds ratios (OR) for the change in proportion of patients testing negative for cocaine at the end of each study and performed multivariate mixed-effects meta-regression. This study was prospectively registered on covidence.org on 31/12/2015, study 8731. Findings: One hundred fifty-seven studies with 15,842 participants were included. Only contingency management was significantly associated with increased odds of testing negative for cocaine (OR of 2.13, 95% CI 1.62-2.80) and remained significant after all sensitivity analyses. Interpretation: This meta-analysis is unique in its broad inclusivity of treatment types and trial designs over a two-decade period of investigation. Our results converge with focused meta-analyses on treatments for cocaine use disorders; thus, research efforts and policy changes that expanded implementation of contingency management programs are expected to reduce cocaine use in active users and the associated individual, community, and societal burdens associated.","Bentzley, B.

It removes the need for in-person testing procedures especially for rural regions where related medical supplies, experienced workers, and equipment are limited. However, existing sound-based diagnostic approaches are trained in a fully supervised manner, which requires large scale well-labelled data. It is critical to discover new methods to leverage unlabelled respiratory data, which can be obtained more easily. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised learning enabled framework for COVID-19 cough classification. A contrastive pre-training phase is introduced to train a Transformer-based feature encoder with unlabelled data. Specifically, we design a random masking mechanism to learn robust representations of respiratory sounds. The pre-trained feature encoder is then fine-tuned in the downstream phase to perform cough classification. In addition, different ensembles with varied random masking rates are also explored in the downstream phase. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that the proposed contrastive pre-training, the random masking mechanism, and the ensemble architecture contribute to improving cough classification performance.","Xue, Hao; Salim, Flora D.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.07566v2.pdf,650

Threats such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and technological infrastructures of surveillance capitalism, materially shape social realities. This paper explores current doctoral research, the AURA case study, which accounts for the cultural, contextual undercurrents and hidden operations of these threats, and how they refashion wearables practice. AURA is a series of Internet of Things (IoT) connected, olfactory wearables that render sensor-captured data into digital scent display. The author argues that bodies, as the subject of and venue for data extraction, are invested in, and fashioned by, bio-political power structures of systemic surveillance. A critical approach examines how bodies are materially re-crafted by physiological and psychological hazards—proposing an expanded understanding of technology as a bodily matter of the social practice of dress. The focus is to lend the notion of bodily matters as an analytical filter for reading important insights from fashion, and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) studies through one another while proposing a subversive reworking of olfactory interfaces for wearables. This research employs critical fashion practice to embed wireless communication technologies and digital olfactory data visualisation for a spectrum of purposes, from wearable scent displays to protective forms that shield the body from airborne contaminants. Thoughtful dialogue in temporary public forums and workshops gathers specific issues of automated olfactory display where capitalised technology applications and a global pandemic converge. Community-defined perceived harms and external threats warrant personal protection. The olfactory sense is a way to access emotion-based, ecological and ethical connections across spatial and temporal scales in speculative wearables design. This paper outlines changing roles and practices for multi-sensory wearables innovation, working to suggest new modes beyond current technology development paradigms, for empowered and meaningful interactions in networked data infrastructures.","McMillan, Caroline","Journal of Textile Design, Research and Practice",https://doi.org/10.1080/20511787.2021.1902657,650

Using a map of a real university dormitory floor, the model simulates agents moving about and potentially infecting each other. Health interventions tested are vaccination and masking, including whether the solitary initial infectious agent was masked. Universal masking with N95 masks and 100% vaccination of susceptible people resulted in significantly lower prevalence after 3 weeks compared to all other scenarios, but still led to a substantial number of infections. Increased vaccination levels from 52% to 100% by itself did not result in a significant difference in prevalence due to symptomatic and asymptomatic breakthrough infections. These results suggest that vaccination alone is insufficient to stem outbreaks, and the best way to reduce COVID-19 infections is to ensure that all infectious people are masked. However, because asymptomatic infections are common, the only way to ensure this is universal masking, which also reduces prevalence by protecting susceptible individuals from infection. Universal masking is the best way forward, especially under threat of the Delta variant, to keep facilities open and safe for occupants, while minimizing the number of infections.","McPeck, R.; Magori, K.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.09.13.21263458v1?rss=1,650

Children play behavior adapt to the conditions faced by children.","Bobby Saragih, J. F.",IOP Conference Series. Earth and Environmental Science,https://doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/794/1/012232,650
171900,SARS-CoV-2 expresses a microRNA-like small RNA able to selectively repress host genes,2021-09-08,"Rhabdomyolysis is an acute condition with skeletal muscle damage and release of toxins produced by myocytes with variable clinical presentation. Laboratory diagnosis is based on an increase in serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK), which can trigger irreversible renal impairment. The aim was to describe the association of COVID-19 with rhabdomyolysis as a serious complication, in order to promote early diagnosis and treatment. Case description: Female patient, 18 years old, grade 3 obesity, complaining of dry cough for 7 days, associated with continuous fever for 4 days, myalgia of the lower limbs and moderate dyspnea for 2 days, was admitted to the emergency room and sent to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), with positive PCR-RT. After 12 hours of admission, the patient developed severe hypoxemic acute respiratory failure. On the second day of hospitalization, an exponential increase in CPK was found and measures of volume optimization were initiated. On the seventh day of hospitalization, associated with increased CPK, a decline in renal function was observed, evolving to the need for renal replacement therapy. On the ninth day of hospitalization, she presented with multiple organ dysfunction and death. In conclusion, COVID-19 can generate rhabdomyolysis by direct myocyte injury by SARS-CoV-2, an exacerbated immune response to the virus resulting in a cytokine storm with concomitant muscle damage and through direct injury by circulating viral toxins. However, as it is an uncommon manifestation and presents a nonspecific clinical condition, early diagnosis is not always performed. This conclusion was based on the case report presented and not only on the results of the literature review, since the clinical case is in accordance with the literature and can contribute to the recognition of these conditions, leading to better management in the treatment.","Flato, U.

This medicinal plant is effective against numerous infectious microbial and viral diseases and is used by many global communities as a source of artemisinin derivatives that are first-line drugs to treat malaria. Aim of the Study The SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) global pandemic has killed millions and evolved numerous variants, with delta being the most transmissible to date and causing break-through infections of vaccinated individuals. We further queried the efficacy of A. annua cultivars against new variants. Materials and Methods Using Vero E6 cells, we measured anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of dried-leaf hot-water A. annua extracts of four cultivars, A3, BUR, MED, and SAM, to determine their efficacy against five fully infectious variants of the virus: alpha (B.1.1.7), beta (B.1.351), gamma (P.1), delta (B.1.617.2), and kappa (B.1.617.1). Results In addition to being effective against the original wild type WA1, A. annua cultivars A3, BUR, MED and SAM were also potent against all five variants. IC50 and IC90 values based on measured artemisinin content ranged from 0.3-8.4 μM and 1.4-25.0 μM, respectively. The IC50 and IC90 values based on dried leaf weight (DW) used to make the tea infusions ranged from 11.0-67.7 μg DW and 59.5-160.6 μg DW, respectively. Cell toxicity was insignificant at a leaf dry weight of ≤50 μg in the extract of any cultivar. Conclusions Results suggest that oral consumption of A. annua hot-water extracts (tea infusions), could provide a cost-effective therapy to help stave off the rapid global spread of these variants, buying time for broader implementation of vaccines.","Nair, M.S.; Huang, Y.; Fidock, D.A.; Towler, M.J.; Weathers, P.J.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.08.459260,650

The novel blockchain technology may be employed by many sectors, i.e., healthcare, bank, government services, and supply chain. In particular, Biomedical Engineering Supply Chain (BESC) is a significant part of the medical sector that supplies equipment for the medical sector i.e., Covid-19 testing kit, PPE (Personal Protection Equipment), and medicine. The biomedical product should be able to be traced and the data secured;otherwise, the initial data may be modified and potentially risking patients and the public. Nevertheless, the conventional centralized technology creates a leakage point and as such, compromises data security. This paper proposes a new data dealing approach with using Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain-based BESC to alleviate the centralized controllable and operational issues. The blockchain-based BESC is a novel approach, which can control the users and subsequently eliminate the possibility of tampering within the blockchain system when stored.","Amin, M. R.; Zuhairi, M.

Periods of strict restrictions placed on people?s movements outside their homes, aimed at curbing the spread of the novel coronavirus, have meant that the home was requisitioned as a primary site for work for many people. In this article, we draw on case studies from an ethnographic project that explored how people living in Sydney use digital technologies in the home setting. Our fieldwork commenced in early 2020, just prior to the national COVID lockdown period in Australia, and continued throughout the lockdown and the months following. As a result, we were able to document people?s experiences of transitioning to working from home during the first year of the pandemic. In this article, we adopt a sociomaterial approach together with domestication theory to analyse the complexities of the changed COVID home in the context of digitised working arrangements. We surface and theorise the tensions and leaky boundaries between workplaces and family/domestic life that are brought about by, through and beyond the digital. By addressing the sociomaterial choreographies and modalities of presence involved, we attempt to capture the processes through which the COVID digital home assemblage is continuously configured and the more or less simultaneous presence and absence of people in both domestic and work domains.","Watson, Ash Lupton Deborah Michael Mike",Convergence,https://doi.org/10.1177/13548565211030848,650

However, research and development in this area have fallen behind, particularly considering its origin and structural features. To tackle this, we initially combined Q-PCR and low-pass whole genome sequencing in the same analytical strategy previously and successfully used for cir-nDNA. This revealed unexplained structural patterns and led us to correlate these data with observations made during physical examinations such as filtration, and differential centrifugation in various plasma preparations. Both the integrity index and number of reads revealed a very minor proportion of low size-ranged fragments (<1000 bp) in plasma obtained with a standard preparation (0.06%). Filtration and high speed second step centrifugation revealed that 98.7 and 99.4% corresponded to extracellular mitochondria either free or in large extracellular vesicles. When avoiding platelet activation during plasma preparation, the proportion of both types of entities was still preponderant (76-80%), but the amount of detected mitochondrial DNA decreased 67-fold. In correlation with our previous study on the presence of circulating cell-free mitochondria in blood, our differential centrifugation procedure suggested that cir-mtDNA is also associated with approximately 18% small extracellular vesicles, 1.7% exosomes and 4% protein complexes.","Roch, Benoit; Pisareva, Ekaterina; Sanchez, Cynthia; Pastor, Brice; Tanos, Rita; Mirandola, Alexia; Mazard, Thibault; Amir Dache, Zahra Al; Thierry, Alain R.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.03.458846,650

Further, educational settings of schools and universities have either fully closed or reduced their class sizes. As countries begin to reopen classrooms, a key question will be how large classes can be while still preventing local outbreaks of disease. Here we develop and analyse a simple, stochastic epidemiological model where individuals (considered as students) live in fixed households and are assigned to a fixed class for daily lessons. We compare key measures of the epidemic - the peak infected, the total infected by day 180 and the calculated $R_0$ - as the size of class is varied. We find that class sizes of 10 could largely restrict outbreaks and often had overlapping inter-quartile ranges with our most cautious case of classes of 5. However, class sizes of 30 or more often result in large epdiemics. Reducing the class size from 40 to 10 can reduce $R_0$ by as much as 30%, as well as signficantly reducing the numbers infected. Intermediate class sizes show considerable variation, with the total infected varying as much as from 20% to 80% for the same class size. We show that additional in-class NPIs can limit the epidemic still further, but that reducing class sizes appears to have a larger effect on the epidemic. We do not specifically tailor our model for Covid-19, but our results stress the importance of small class sizes for preventing large outbreaks of infectious disease.","Best, A.; Singh, P.; Ward, C.; Vitale, C.; Oliver, M.; Idris, L.; Poulston, A.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.26.21252501v1?rss=1,650

Recent studies have found that journal articles that were previously posted to bioRxiv received a higher number of citations or mentions/shares on other online platforms compared to articles in the same journals that were not posted. However, the exact causal mechanism for this effect has not been established, and may in part be related to authors’ biases in the selection of articles that are chosen to be posted as preprints. We aimed to investigate this mechanism by conducting a mixed-methods survey of 1,444 authors of bioRxiv preprints, to investigate the reasons that they post or do not post certain articles as preprints, and to make comparisons between articles they choose to post and not post as preprints. We find that authors are most strongly motivated to post preprints to increase awareness of their work and increase the speed of its dissemination; conversely, the strongest reasons for not posting preprints centre around a lack of awareness of preprints and reluctance to publicly post work that has not undergone a peer review process. We additionally find weak evidence that authors preferentially select their highest quality, most novel or most significant research to post as preprints, however, authors retain an expectation that articles they post as preprints will receive more citations or be shared more widely online than articles not posted.","Fraser, Nicholas; Mayr, Philipp; Peters, Isabella",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.07.459259,650

It is now possible to construct realistic models of infectious disease dynamics for the purposes of understanding global-scale epidemics. Nevertheless, a remaining unanswered question is how best to leverage the new data to parameterize models of movement, and whether one's choice of movement model impacts modeled disease outcomes. We adapt three well-studied models of infectious disease dynamics, the SIR model; the SIS model; and the Ross-Macdonald model, to incorporate either of two candidate movement models. We describe the effect that the choice of movement model has on each disease model's results, finding that in all cases there are parameter regimes where choosing one movement model instead of another has a profound impact on epidemiological outcomes. We further demonstrate the importance of choosing an appropriate movement model using the applied case of malaria transmission and importation on Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea, finding that one model produces intelligible predictions of R0 while the other produces nonsensical results.","Citron, Daniel T; Guerra, Carlos A; Dolgert, Andrew J; Wu, Sean L; Henry, John M; Sanchez Castellanos, Hector M; Smith, David L",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.05.20054304,650

In contrast to genetic adaptation that spans multiple generations as an evolutionary process, phenotypic plasticity allows acclimation within the life-time of an organism. Genetic adaptation and phenotypic plasticity are usually studied in isolation, however, only by including their interactive impact, we can understand acclimation and adaptation in nature. We aimed to explore the contribution of adaptation and plasticity in coping with an abiotic (salinity) and a biotic (Vibrio bacteria) stressor using six different populations of the broad-nosed pipefish Syngnathus typhle that originated from either high or low saline environments. We hypothesized that wild S. typhle populations are locally adapted to the salinity and prevailing pathogens of their native environment, and that short-term acclimation of parents to a novel salinity may aid in buffering offspring phenotypes in a matching environment. To test these hypotheses, we exposed all wild caught animals, to either high or low salinity, representing native and novel salinity conditions and allowed animals to mate. After male pregnancy, offspring was split and each half was exposed to one of the two salinities and infected with Vibrio alginolyticus bacteria that were evolved at either of the two salinities in a fully reciprocal design. We investigated life history traits of fathers (offspring survival, offspring size) and expression of 47 target genes in mothers and offspring. Pregnant males originating from high salinity exposed to low salinity were highly susceptible to opportunistic fungi infections resulting in decreased offspring size and number. In contrast, no signs of fungal infection were identified in fathers originating from low saline conditions suggesting that genetic adaptation has the potential to overcome the challenging conditions of low salinity. Genetic adaptation increased survival rates of juveniles from parents in lower salinity (in contrast to those from high salinity). Juvenile gene expression indicated patterns of local adaptation, trans-generational plasticity and developmental plasticity. The results of our study suggest that pipefish locally adapted to low salinity retain phenotypic plasticity, which allows them to also cope with ancestral salinity levels and prevailing pathogens.","Goehlich, Henry; Sartoris, Linda; Wagner, Kim Sara; Wendling, Carolin C.; Roth, Olivia",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.12.379305,650

The most effective experimental therapy against the EBOV is the use of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). In this work, we describe the development of HEK293T cells engineered for the transient and stable expression of mAb13C6, a neutralizing anti-EBOV monoclonal antibody. We transfected the HEK293T cells with a tricistronic vector to produce the heavy and the light chain of the antibody 13C6 and intracellular Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) using Lipofectamine 3000. We then selected the transfected cells using puromycin pressure, dilution cloning, and cloning disks. This integrated strategy generated mAb-producing cells in 7 days with a transient expression of ∼1 mg/L. Stable pools were produced after 4 weeks, with expression levels of ∼0.8 mg/L. Stable clones with expression levels of ∼1.8 mg/L were obtained within 10 weeks. The produced antibodies exhibited the expected functionality; they recognized the GP glycoprotein of the Ebola virus in both ELISA assays and cell binding experiments using HEK293T cells engineered to express the EBOV GP at their membrane surface. By the combined use of GFP and the set of selection techniques here described, we drastically reduced the time from transfection to stable clone generation without resorting to costly equipment.

Little is known about the operational impacts of transitioning from in-person to video visits in specialty clinics. In 2018, the Stanford South Asian Translational Heart Initiative (SSATHI), a preventive cardiology clinic focused on high-risk South Asian adults, introduced CardioClick, a program replacing in-person follow-up visits with video visits. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that implementation of video visits increased the efficiency of clinic operations. Methods: We extracted visit-level data from the EHR for 134 patients enrolled in CardioClick with video follow-up visits from June 14, 2018 to April 21, 2020 and a cohort of 276 patients enrolled in the in-person SSATHI prevention program with follow-up visits from September 11, 2014 to March 6, 2020. Results: Patients in CardioClick and the in-person cohort were similar in terms of age (mean 45 years), gender balance (23 vs 21% female), and cardiometabolic risk profiles. There were 181 video and 637 in-person follow-up visits. Video visits were shorter than in-person visits, both in terms of total clinic time [median 22 min (IQR 16, 29) vs 67 min (48, 100)] and provider time required [median22 min (IQR 16, 29) vs 30 min (12, 58)]. Video visits were more likely to end on time (71 vs 11%,p&lt;0.001). The median video visit ended on time while the median in-person visit ended 32 min late(13, 70) (see Figure). Providers were also more likely to complete video visit documentation thesame day (56 vs 42%, p=0.001). Conclusions: In a preventive cardiology clinic, video follow-up visits required less clinic and provider time than in-person visits, were more likely to end on time, and were associated with increased same-day provider documentation completion. In conclusion, video visits offer benefitsbeyond their convenience and may increase the operational efficiency of specialty care practicesfocused on disease prevention, improving value in care delivery.","Kalwani, N.

Thus, the objective of this study is to survey the personal hygiene practices among Tanjong Malim, Perak Community During Movement Control Order (MCO) Due to Covid-19. A survey technique with a set of questionnaires was used to collect the required data on 383 respondents. The data were collected using a cross-sectional descriptive study, and percentage were utilised to determine the level of association. The results show that most of Tanjong Malim community practice a good hand washing technique with a mean value of 4.36 and SD = 0.66. They are also practising good personal hygiene by taking a shower immediately after returning home from public places with a mean value of 4.05 and SD = 0.82. They also wash their clothes immediately after returning home from public places (mean value of 3.90, SD = 0.87). On the other hand, the practice of separating clothes during washing is also high, with a mean value of 3.95, SD = 0.93. The personal hygiene attitude, namely washing their hand before and after touching something inside and outside the house, is also high with a mean value of 4.55, SD = 0.7 and 4.67, SD = 0.5, respectively.

The aim of this study was to estimate the levels of PA, expressed as energy expenditure (MET-minute/week), among the physically active Sicilian population before and during the last seven days of the COVID-19 quarantine. Furthermore, the relation between this parameter and specific demographic and anthropometric variables was analyzed. Methods: 802 Sicilian physically active participants (mean age: 32.27 ± 12.81 years; BMI: 23.44 ± 3.33 kg/m2) were included in the study and grouped based on gender, age and BMI. An adapted version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-short form (IPAQ-SF) was administered to the participants through an online survey. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test and the Kruskal-Wallis rank-sum test were used for statistical analyses. Results: As expected, we observed a significant decrease of the total weekly energy expenditure during the COVID-19 quarantine (p < 0.001). A significant variation in the MET-min/wk in the before quarantine condition (p = 0.046) and in the difference between before and during quarantine (p = 0.009) was found for males and females. The male group decreased the PA level more than the female one. Moreover, a significant difference in the MET-min/wk was found among groups distributions of BMI (p < 0.001, during quarantine) and of age (p < 0.001, both before and during quarantine). In particular, the highest and the lowest levels of PA were reported by the young and the elderly, respectively, both before and during quarantine.

We then demonstrate that the discovery of the violation of baryon minus lepton number ($B-L$) which pinpoints to its violation in primordial Universe at any cosmic temperature above $30$ TeV will open up a new window of baryogenesis in these effective charges above this scale. While the fast SM baryon number violation in the early Universe could be the first piece to solve the puzzle of cosmic baryon asymmetry, $(B-L)$ violation could be the second important piece. In the background of expanding Universe, there is ample opportunity for out-of-equilibrium processes to generate an asymmetry in the numerous effective charges in the SM or the MSSM, making a baryon asymmetric Universe almost unavoidable. Finally we provide examples in the SM and the MSSM where baryogenesis can proceed through out-of-equilibrium dynamics without explicitly breaking baryon nor lepton number.","Fong, Chee Sheng",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.03973v2.pdf,650

This led to a concern that loneliness may increase, facilitating poorer mental and physical health. Twenty qualitative interviews were conducted, with a diverse group of UK-based men, between January and March 2021, during severe restrictions. Our aim was to generate new insights into men's experience of loneliness during the pandemic, and consider the ramifications of these for continued/future restrictions, the easing of restrictions, and the future beyond the pandemic. Thematic analysis, focused on semantic themes, was employed as part of a 'grounded' epistemology whereby the stated perspectives of the interviewees drove the content of the study. Six themes were constructed: i) people to see and things to do (broken, changed, and new); ii) rethought and renewed recognition of what is important; iii) loneliness with a purpose; iv) loneliness as normal; v) anxiety of social contact; and vi) easier for some than others. The restrictions did cause some loneliness, particularly because of lost routines and opportunities, and the reduction in face-to-face interaction. However, a need to reduce transmission of SARS-COV-2, and a fear of catching it, became important features of participants lives that also affected loneliness and its causes. Remote forms of interaction were often utilised, and though they were imperfect, those that were dependable, were smaller than might be desired in person, and ensured a chance to speak, were constructed as more positive. The fear of Covid-19, and a loss of social skills, may mean that reducing restrictions alone will not return everyone to pre-pandemic levels of loneliness. Some believed the building of supportive local communities, and a destigmatisation of loneliness, may allow for the building of a more compassionate and less lonely society.","Ratcliffe, J.; Galdas, P.; Kanaan, M.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.30.21259536v1?rss=1,650
179038,The in vitro and in vivo potency of CT-P59 against Delta and its associated variants of SARS-CoV-2,2021-07-23,"Following initial optimism regarding the potential for rapid vaccination, delays and shortages in vaccine supplies have occurred in many countries. Various strategies to counter this gloomy reality and speed up vaccination have been set forth, of which the most popular approach has been to delay the second vaccine dose for a longer period than originally recommended by the manufacturers. Controversy has surrounded this strategy, and overly simplistic models have been developed to shed light on this issue. Here we use three different epidemic models, all accounting for the actual COVID-19 epidemic in the Czech Republic, including the rise and eventual prevalence of the B.1.1.7 variant of SARS-CoV-2 virus and real vaccination rollout strategy, to explore when delaying the second vaccine dose from 21 days to 42 days is advantageous. Using the numbers of COVID-19-related deaths as a quantity for comparing various model scenarios, we find that vaccine mode of action at the beginning of the infection course (preventing contagion and symptom appearance), mild epidemic and sufficient vaccine supply rate call for the original inter-delay scenario of 21 days regardless of vaccine efficacy. On the contrary, for vaccine mode of action at the end of infection course (preventing severe symptoms and death), severe epidemic and low vaccine supply rate, the 42-day inter-dose period is preferable, at any plausible vaccine efficacy.","Berec, L.; Levinsky, R.; Weiner, J.; Smid, M.; Neruda, R.; Vidnerova, P.; Suchoparova, G.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.30.21259752v1?rss=1,650

Here, we describe the outbreak and use sequence data with Bayesian phylodynamic methods to explore SARS-CoV-2 transmission in minks and related humans on farms. High number of farm infections (68/126) in minks and farm related personnel (>50% of farms) were detected, with limited spread to the general human population. Three of five initial introductions of SARS-CoV-2 lead to subsequent spread between mink farms until November 2020. The largest cluster acquired a mutation in the receptor binding domain of the Spike protein (position 486), evolved faster and spread more widely and longer. Movement of people and distance between farms were statistically significant predictors of virus dispersal between farms. Our study provides novel insights into SARS-CoV-2 transmission between mink farms and highlights the importance of combing genetic information with epidemiological information at the animal-human interface.","Lu, Lu; Sikkema, Reina S.; Velkers, Francisca C.; Nieuwenhuijse, David F.; Fischer, Egil A.J.; Meijer, Paola A.; Bouwmeester-Vincken, Noortje; Rietveld, Ariene; Wegdam-Blans, Marjolijn C.A.; Tolsma, Paulien; Koppelman, Marco; Smit, Lidwien A.M.; Hakze-van der Honing, Renate W.; van der Poel, Wim H.

As such, capillary and venous A1c samples were assessed using 3 commercial home kits (Home Access, CoreMedica, A1cNow) and 2 non-commercial kits from academic centers (U of MN Advanced Research and Diagnostic Lab [ARDL] and Children's Mercy Hospital [CMH]). Samples were collected either with study staff guidance (non-commercial) or hands-on assistance (commercial) and sent by USPS for processing except for the immediate response A1cNow+ kit. Differences in A1c between commercial kits and reference values were appreciable (Table). Notably, none of the commercially tested kits reached the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program target of more than 90% of values within 5% of DCCT venous reference values although the Home Access kit performed much better than the other two. In contrast, evaluation of kits from ARDL and CMH showed 97.4% of values within the 5% standard. Ease of use and discomfort with sample collection varied between kits.

Design/methodology/approach: Liquidity metrics and regressions are used to identify the trend of the market and the variables that significantly impact the successful resale, selling time and discount rate in the secondary market. Structural break analysis is used to examine the impact of COVID on the market. Findings: There is a high demand for performing loans that are sold quickly;however, the discount rate is also high, which reflects the price of liquidity. Based on the results obtained from regressions, the main factors that impact the investors’ decisions are discount rate, borrower’s country, principal and the month passed after loan origination. Furthermore, it can be concluded that the pandemic has led to a structural break in March 2020, and investors have started to liquidate their claims. Practical implications: This paper’s purpose is to add to the research that examines the secondary market in social lending. It also contributes to the understanding of an investor’s decision and behavior, which are key parts of the segment’s long-term sustainability from the demand perspective. The comprehensive understanding of a lender’s behavior is also essential for supervisory authorities and other participants of the financial market. Originality/value: Previous studies mostly focused on credit risk aspects, whereas this paper contributes to the modest research of liquidity features. The added value of this paper is further supported by the use of a large European secondary market data set, including more than 5 million transactions, covering an 18-month horizon. Moreover, the market’s sensitivity is analyzed in the case of an external shock. In the beginning of 2020, the COVID outbreak caused an economic shutdown in many European countries.

This paper aims to present the constraints faced by SMFIs, especially concerning raw materials and marketing, in taking advantage of domestic market opportunities, and proposes alternative solutions. The study was conducted on four SMFIs that produce functional food in Malang Regency. Data were collected through in-depth interviews. The results showed that the demand for functional foods such as garlic, ginger, turmeric and fruits increased during the Covid-19 pandemic, which seemed to be related to public awareness about increasing immunity. However, the obstacles faced by SMFIs were the high price of raw materials due to limited supply, and limited marketing because they did not have distribution licenses from BPOM. Information about the process and BPOM's distribution permit requirements was very limited for SMFI managers, and large capital was needed to fulfill the requirements of Good Manufacturing Practices. Therefore, SMFIs should have long-term cooperation with farmers to ensure the availability of raw materials;build networks and maintain cooperation with customers;and utilize credit for MSMEs in the economic recovery program provided by the government to meet the GMP requirements in BPOM's distribution permit. The government should conduct intensive outreach to SMFI managers about the process and requirements for distribution permits from BPOM, credit facilities, and other policies related to economic recovery during the Covid-19 pandemic.","Taneo, S.

Hypothesis: Use of penalized regression with stability analysis may identify new, sparse sets of risk factors jointly associated with COVID-19 mortality. Methods: We investigated demographic, social, lifestyle, biological (lipids, cystatin C, vitamin D), medical (comorbidities, medications) and air pollution data from UK Biobank (N=473,574) in relation to linked COVID-19 mortality, and compared with non-COVID-19 mortality. We used penalized regression models (LASSO) with stability analysis (80% selection threshold from 1,000 models with 80% subsampling) to identify a sparse set of variables associated with COVID-19 mortality. Results: Among 43 variables considered by LASSO stability selection, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, cystatin C, age, male sex and Black ethnicity were jointly predictive of COVID-19 mortality risk at 80% selection threshold (Figure). Of these, Black ethnicity and hypertension contributed to COVID-19 but not non-COVID-19 mortality. Conclusions: Use of LASSO stability selection identified a sparse set of predictors for COVID-19mortality including cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes and cystatin C, a marker of renalfunction that has also been implicated in atherogenesis and inflammation. These results indicate theimportance of cardiometabolic comorbidities as predisposing factors for COVID-19 mortality.Hypertension was differentially highly selected for risk of COVID-19 mortality, suggesting the need for continued vigilance with good blood pressure control during the pandemic.","Elliott, J.; Bodinier, B.; Whitaker, M.; Tzoulaki, I.; Elliott, P.; Chadeau-Hyam, M.",Circulation,https://doi.org/10.1161/circ.143.suppl_1.041,650

Urban population density—considered as the ratio of population to land area, without reference to floor space consumption or other measures of livability—can have large drawbacks. To address this drawback and distinguish between density and crowding, it is important to adjust for measures of floor space as well as open space and neighborhood amenities. We use a dataset on building heights, representative of cities worldwide, to measure densities based on floor area consumption per person as well as apply this measure to develop a COVID-19 hotspot predictive tool to help city leaders prioritize civic and medical resources during the pandemic. We conclude by outlining priority interventions that could enable city leaders and local governments to transform crowded cities into livable places.","Lall, Somik V.; Wahba, Sameh N.",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13137167,650

It suggests alternate models based on new values to help tourism emerge from the current COVID crisis and “come-of-age.” Design/methodology/approach: The paper delineates the assumptions of neoliberal economics upon which much of tourism has been based. It then summarizes the work of progressive economists in developing new models that value capital other than financial. Six of these models are briefly described and applied to tourism. Findings: Some assumptions underlying the neoliberal economic model that need re-examining are the ideas that: self-interest drives ideal economic behavior;success comes from competition, not cooperation;encouraging consumption for its own sake;giving owners priority over other stakeholders;and more income translates into more happiness. Redesign of economic systems requires consideration of social capital, natural capital, intellectual capital, compassion capital, trust capital and spiritual capital to name a few.

Nouzilly strain is able to induce a protective lactogenic immunity in suckling piglets against severe virulent TGE challenge. However the level of neutralizing activity in serum and milk of vaccinated sows at the time of challenge exposure is not correlated with passive protection rate. Separation of the immunoglobulin classes bearing neutralizing activity in serum and milk from vaccinated sows, by ion-exchange chromatography, failed to demonstrate any relationship between antibody level of these fractions and passive protection rate of piglets.

A whole killed (inactivated by beta-propiolactone) SARS-CoV vaccine and a combination of two adenovirus-based vectors, one expressing the nucleocapsid (N) and the other expressing the spike (S) protein (collectively designated Ad S/N), were evaluated for the induction of serum neutralizing antibodies and cellular immune responses and their ability to protect against pulmonary SARS-CoV replication. The whole killed virus (WKV) vaccine given subcutaneously to 129S6/SvEv mice was more effective than the Ad S/N vaccine administered either intranasally or intramuscularly in inhibiting SARS-CoV replication in the murine respiratory tract. This protective ability of the WKV vaccine correlated with the induction of high serum neutralizing-antibody titres, but not with cellular immune responses as measured by gamma interferon secretion by mouse splenocytes. Titres of serum neutralizing antibodies induced by the Ad S/N vaccine administered intranasally or intramuscularly were significantly lower than those induced by the WKV vaccine. However, Ad S/N administered intranasally, but not intramuscularly, significantly limited SARS-CoV replication in the lungs. Among the vaccine groups, SARS-CoV-specific IgA was found only in the sera of mice immunized intranasally with Ad S/N, suggesting that mucosal immunity may play a role in protection for the intranasal Ad S/N delivery system. Finally, the sera of vaccinated mice contained antibodies to S, further suggesting a role for this protein in conferring protective immunity against SARS-CoV infection.","See, Raymond H; Zakhartchouk, Alexander N; Petric, Martin; Lawrence, David J; Mok, Catherine P Y; Hogan, Robert J; Rowe, Thomas; Zitzow, Lois A; Karunakaran, Karuna P; Hitt, Mary M; Graham, Frank L; Prevec, Ludvik; Mahony, James B; Sharon, Chetna; Auperin, Thierry C; Rini, James M; Tingle, Aubrey J; Scheifele, David W; Skowronski, Danuta M; Patrick, David M; Voss, Thomas G; Babiuk, Lorne A; Gauldie, Jack; Roper, Rachel L; Brunham, Robert C; Finlay, B Brett",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16476986/,650

Nevertheless, there is limited information describing the characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 patients in Latin America. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 9,468 confirmed COVID-19 cases reported in Ecuador. We calculated overall incidence, mortality, case fatality rates, disability adjusted life years, attack and crude mortality rates, as well as relative risk and relative odds of death, adjusted for age, sex and presence of comorbidities. A total of 9,468 positive COVID-19 cases and 474 deaths were included in the analysis. Men accounted for 55.4% (n = 5, 247) of cases and women for 44.6% (n = 4, 221). We found the presence of comorbidities, being male and older than 65 years were important determinants of mortality. Coastal regions were most affected by COVID-19, with higher mortality rates than the highlands. Fatigue was reported in 53.2% of the patients, followed by headache (43%), dry cough (41.7%), ageusia (37.1%) and anosmia (36.1%). We present an analysis of the burden of COVID-19 in Ecuador. Our findings show that men are at higher risk of dying from COVID-19 than women, and risk increases with age and the presence of comorbidities. We also found that blue-collar workers and the unemployed are at greater risk of dying. These early observations offer clinical insights for the medical community to help improve patient care and for public health officials to strengthen Ecuador's response to the outbreak.","Ortiz-Prado, Esteban; Simbaña-Rivera, Katherine; Barreno, Lenin Gómez; Diaz, Ana Maria; Barreto, Alejandra; Moyano, Carla; Arcos, Vannesa; Vásconez-González, Eduardo; Paz, Clara; Simbaña-Guaycha, Fernanda; Molestina-Luzuriaga, Martin; Fernández-Naranjo, Raúl; Feijoo, Javier; Henriquez-Trujillo, Aquiles R; Adana, Lila; López-Cortés, Andrés; Fletcher, Isabel; Lowe, Rachel",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,,650

Assessing this risk implies quantifying transmission from humans-to-cats, from cats-to-cats and from cats-to-humans. Here we quantified the risk of cat-to-cat transmission by reviewing published literature describing transmission either experimentally or under natural conditions in infected households. Data from these studies were collated to quantify the SARS-CoV-2 reproduction number R0 among cats. The estimated R0 was significantly higher than 1, hence cats could play a role in the transmission and maintenance of SARS-CoV-2. Questions that remain to be addressed are the risk of transmission from humans-to-cats and cats-to-humans. Further data on household transmission and data on virus levels in both the environment around infected cats and their exhaled air could be a step towards assessing these risks.","Gonzales, Jose L; Jong, Mart C.M.

However, success always comes with challenges. Deep learning algorithms are data-dependent and require large datasets for training. The lack of data in the medical imaging field creates a bottleneck for the application of deep learning to medical image analysis. Medical image acquisition, annotation, and analysis are costly, and their usage is constrained by ethical restrictions. They also require many resources, such as human expertise and funding. That makes it difficult for non-medical researchers to have access to useful and large medical data. Thus, as comprehensive as possible, this paper provides a collection of medical image datasets with their associated challenges for deep learning research. We have collected information of around three hundred datasets and challenges mainly reported between 2013 and 2020 and categorized them into four categories: head&neck, chest&abdomen, pathology&blood, and ``others''. Our paper has three purposes: 1) to provide a most up to date and complete list that can be used as a universal reference to easily find the datasets for clinical image analysis, 2) to guide researchers on the methodology to test and evaluate their methods' performance and robustness on relevant datasets, 3) to provide a ``route'' to relevant algorithms for the relevant medical topics, and challenge leaderboards.","Li, Johann; Zhu, Guangming; Hua, Cong; Feng, Mingtao; BasheerBennamoun,; Li, Ping; Lu, Xiaoyuan; Song, Juan; Shen, Peiyi; Xu, Xu; Mei, Lin; Zhang, Liang; Shah, Syed Afaq Ali; Bennamoun, Mohammed",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.12864v1.pdf,650

Several documents confirm the clinical efficacy of this therapy for treating bacterial and viral infections. Methods: A comprehensive systematic search was conducted by August 2020 using global databases including PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane library, Google scholar, medRxiv, and bioRxiv. The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal checklist was used to evaluate the included studies. Using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) software version 2.2 (Biostat, Englewood, NJ, USA), the pooled data analysis process was performed. Results: A total of 15 eligible articles were enrolled in the current quantitative synthesis. The statistical analysis showed that clinical improvement in the group of patients who had received convalescent plasma was significantly increased compared to the control group (OR: 2.23; 1.12-4.45 with 95% CIs; p value: 0.022; Q-value: 6.11; I 2 : 83.64; Eggers p value: 0.064; Beggs p value: 0.093). Furthermore, the rate of hospital discharge had increased in patients receiving CPT (OR: 2.92; 1.48-5.77 with 95% CIs; p value: 0.002; Q-Value: 4.32; I 2 : 53.80; Eggers p value: 0.32; Beggs p value: 0.50). Conclusions: Because there is currently no fully effective antiviral drug against the virus, and it will take time to confirm the effectiveness of new drugs, CPT can be used as an alternative treatment strategy to improve the severe clinical manifestations of COVID-19.","Keikha, Masoud; Karbalaei, Mohsen",New Microbes New Infect,,650

Despite upholding multilateralism as the cornerstone of its middle power diplomacy, South Korea has not worked in line with Indo-Pacific second-size powers given Seoul's relatively vague response to the Indo-Pacific structure. With foreign policy shifts from Trump to Biden, South Korea may be well-positioned to communicate its policies with a more nuanced response to the Indo-Pacific. To leverage Seoul's middle power standing and its commitment to multilateralism, the Moon Jae-in administration can be expected to reflect on clearer definitions of what 'Indo-Pacific' means and come up with a more comprehensive understanding of multilateral cooperation in the region so as not to mistake 'Indo-Pacific' for its security connotation. As for South Korea, pursuing a three-headed strategy, for example, continuing to position itself in the Indo-Pacific region as a balancer, enhancing ties with like-minded middle powers, and deepening the South Korea-ASEAN relationship, could accommodate Seoul's interests and concerns amid the U.S.–China strategic competition and the COVID-19 pandemic.

This scoping review provides the first synthesis of research on interpreters working in mental health settings with refugees, one of the most prominent yet understudied strategies to improving language access and the cultural appropriateness of services for this unique population. Comprehensive searches were conducted in PsycINFO, Medline, Web of Science, Social Services Abstracts CAIRN, and Erudit for relevant journal articles and book chapters published up to April 2019. A total of 84 peer-reviewed studies met the inclusion criteria. Publications represented a range of disciplines including social work, linguistics, psychology, anthropology, public health, medicine, psychiatry, and nursing. Six thematic areas were identified: (1) Lack of adequate interpretation as barrier to care; (2) Emotional impact of interpreting on the interpreter; (3) Training and supervision; (4) Impact of the interpreter on the process of psychotherapy/mental health intervention; (5) The impact of the interpreter on the intervention outcome; and (6) The role of the interpreter. The results indicate that despite undeniable challenges, including concerns around confidentiality and bias, when clinicians and refugee clients do not share proficiency in a common language, interpreters have a positive impact on refugee clients' quality of care and clinical outcomes. The implications of these findings for host countries providing mental health services for refugees globally are considered and recommendations offered.

209051,Accurate Evaluation on the Interactions of SARS-CoV-2 with Its Receptor ACE2 and Antibodies CR3022/CB6*,2021,"Resveratrol is a phytoalexin produced by many plants as a defense mechanism against stress-inducing conditions. The richest dietary sources of resveratrol are berries and grapes, their juices and wines. Good bioavailability of resveratrol is not reflected in its high biological activity in vivo because of resveratrol isomerization and its poor solubility in aqueous solutions. Proteins, cyclodextrins and nanomaterials have been explored as innovative delivery vehicles for resveratrol to overcome this limitation. Numerous in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated beneficial effects of resveratrol in cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Main beneficial effects of resveratrol intake are cardioprotective, anti-hypertensive, vasodilatory, anti-diabetic, and improvement of lipid status. As resveratrol can alleviate the numerous factors associated with CVD, it has potential as a functional supplement to reduce COVID-19 illness severity in patients displaying poor prognosis due to cardio-vascular complications. Resveratrol was shown to mitigate the major pathways involved in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 including regulation of the renin-angiotensin system and expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, stimulation of immune system and downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine release. Therefore, several studies already have anticipated potential implementation of resveratrol in COVID-19 treatment. Regular intake of a resveratrol rich diet, or resveratrol-based complementary medicaments, may contribute to a healthier cardio-vascular system, prevention and control of CVD, including COVID-19 disease related complications of CVD.","Gligorijevic, Nikola; Stanic-Vucinic, Dragana; Radomirovic, Mirjana; Stojadinovic, Marija; Khulal, Urmila; Nedic, Olgica; Cirkovic Velickovic, Tanja",Molecules (Basel),,650

As ophthalmological manifestations of COVID-19 in newborns are still unknown, it is important to clarify if SARS-CoV-2 could be associated with ocular abnormalities. Objective: To determine whether exposure to SARS-CoV-2 is associated with outcomes in the eyes of newborns. Design, Setting, and Participants: This case series enrolled newborns from April to November 2020 from 3 different maternity hospitals in São Paulo, Brazil. The diagnosis of COVID-19 in mothers and newborns was based on real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assays with material obtained from oronasopharyngeal swab sample; positive IGM serology was also considered as a diagnostic test for mothers. Newborns were excluded if they had any evidence of another congenital infection. All infants underwent external ocular examination and binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy. Exposures: Serology test for COVID-19 and detection of SARS-CoV-2 from oronasopharyngeal specimen using a real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay on both mothers and newborns. Main Outcomes and Measures: Screening for ophthalmologic manifestation in newborns after maternal COVID-19 infection. Results: A total of 165 newborns (age range at examination, 1 to 18 days) were evaluated. Of these, 123 (74.5%) were born at full term, and 42 (25.4%) were born preterm. Maternal gestational age at the time of COVID-19-positive test varied from first to 40th gestational weeks. Six newborns (3.6%) had positive polymerase chain reaction findings for SARS-CoV-2. One newborn tested positive within 18 days (horizontal transmission), and 5 newborns tested positive in the first day of life (possible vertical transmission). None had ocular abnormalities. Concerning exposed newborns with negative test results, 1 presented with venous engorgement and vascular tortuosity, 7 had intraretinal hemorrhages, and 2 were diagnosed as having retinopathy of prematurity. Conclusions and Relevance: In this uncontrolled case series of Brazilian newborns of mothers with COVID-19 infection, a low rate of COVID-19 infection was found among newborns, and none had ocular abnormalities.

The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a rise in fear, anxiety, stress, and depression among the population: of these, university undergraduates from countries severely affected by COVID-19 are some of the most vulnerable of all, as they face strict lockdown measures and have fewer resources to cope with it. The aim of this study was to analyze the levels of fear of COVID-19, stress, anxiety, and depression during lockdown among undergraduates from Ecuador, and to test these possible predictors of depression using a model taken from our study of the scientific literature. A total of 640 undergraduates (72% women) between 18 and 47 years old (M = 21.69; S.D = 4.093) were surveyed. The resulting mean levels found for stress, anxiety, and depression were above levels considered non-pathological. Women showed higher levels of fear of COVID-19 than men. The statistical prediction for depression showed a good fit. This depression could be related: both directly and positively by fear of COVID-19 and stress, and indirectly, as a result of these two factors, positively mediated by anxiety. Our study concludes by highlighting the important role that the complex relationships between fear, stress, and anxiety can play in the development of depression symptoms and how they can be taken into account in programs aimed at preventing and alleviating this disorder.

217626,Quantitative Fluorescence Microscopy on SARS-CoV-2,2021,"The frequency and severity of shocks to food systems is accelerating globally, exemplified by the current COVID-19 outbreak In low- and middle-income countries, the impacts have exacerbated existing food system vulnerabilities and poverty Governments and donors must respond quickly, but few tools are available that identify interventions to build food system resilience, or emerging opportunities for transformation In this paper we reflect on the application of a systems-based rapid assessment which we applied across 11 Indo-Pacific countries in May-July 2020 Our approach was shaped by three design parameters: the integration of key informants’ perspectives engaged remotely within the countries, applicability to diverse food systems and COVID-19 experiences across the region, and the consideration of food systems as complex systems For the rapid assessment we adopted an analytical framework proposed by Allen and Prosperi (2016) To include a development lens, we added the analysis of vulnerable groups and their exposure, impacts, recovery potential and resilience, and pro-poor interventions We concluded that the framework and approach facilitated integration and triangulation of disparate knowledge types and data to identify priority interventions and was sufficiently flexible to be applied across food systems, at both national, sub-national and commodity scales The step-wise method was simple and enabled structured inquiry and reporting Although the systems concepts appeared more easily transferrable to key informants in some countries than others, potentially transformational interventions were identified, and also some risks of maladaptation We present a refined framework that emphasises analysis of political, economic and institutional drivers of exposure and vulnerability, the constraints that they pose for building recovery potential and resilience, and trade-offs amongst winners and losers inherent in proposed interventions","Butler, James R.

An estimated 798,365 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander were in Australia, 5,2 million indigenous people living in America and 2,13 million in Canada. Racial/ethnic disparities in mental health service use have increased especially in the context of the new coronavirus pandemic. Thus, we aimed to describe the mental health situation of the indigenous population in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: : The studies were identified in well-known international journals found in three electronic databases: PubMed, Scopus, and MEDLINE. The data were cross-checked with information from the main international newspapers. Results: : According to the literature, due to the COVID-19 pandemic there is a lack of specialized mental health services and professionals, a restricted access to quality information and a lack of access to inputs, causing negative feelings and it can exacerbate pre-existing mental problems (eg: depression, suicidal ideation, smoking and binge drink). The cultural differences are a risk factor to worsen the mental health of this already vulnerable population. Conclusion: : providing psychological first aid is an essential care component for indigenous populations that have been victims COVID-19 pandemic.","Júnior, Jucier Gonçalves; Moreira, Marcial Moreno; Pinheiro, Woneska Rodrigues; de Amorim, Liromaria Maria; Lima, Carlos Kennedy Tavares; da Silva, Claúdio Gleidiston Lima; Neto, Modesto Leite Rolim",Psychiatry Res,,650

Over the past 12 months, a dizzying array of information has emerged from numerous laboratories, covering everything from the putative origin of SARS-CoV-2 to the development of numerous candidate vaccines. Many immunologists quickly pivoted from their existing research to focus on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and, owing to this unprecedented convergence of efforts on one viral infection, a remarkable body of work has been produced and disseminated, through both preprint servers and peer-reviewed journals. Here, we take readers through the timeline of key discoveries during the first year of the pandemic, which showcases the extraordinary leaps in our understanding of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and highlights gaps in our knowledge as well as areas for future investigations.","Carvalho, Thiago; Krammer, Florian; Iwasaki, Akiko",Nat Rev Immunol,,650

The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in different organs in correlation with tissue damage and post-mortem viral dynamics in COVID-19 deceased. Twenty-eight patients (17 males, 11 females; age 66-96 years; mean 82.9, median 82.5 years) diagnosed with COVID-19 were studied. Swabs were taken post-mortem during autopsy (N = 19) from the throat, both lungs, intestine, gallbladder, and brain or without autopsy (N = 9) only from the throat. Selective amplification of target nucleic acid from the samples was achieved by using primers for ORF1a/b non-structural region and the structural protein envelope E-gene of the virus. The results of 125 post-mortem and 47 ante-mortem swabs were presented as cycle threshold (Ct) values and categorized as strong, moderate, and weak. Viral RNA was detected more frequently in the lungs and throat than in the intestine. Blood, bile, and the brain were negative. Consecutive throat swabs were positive up to 128 h after death without significant increase of Ct values. All lungs showed diffuse alveolar damage, thrombosis, and infarction and less frequently bronchopneumonia irrespective of Ct values. In 30% the intestine revealed focal ischemic changes. Nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 was detected by immunohistochemistry in bronchial and intestinal epithelium, bronchial glands, and pneumocytes. In conclusion, viral RNA is still present several days after death, most frequently in the respiratory tract and associated with severe and fatal organ damage. Potential infectivity cannot be ruled out post-mortem.","Skok, Kristijan; Stelzl, Evelyn; Trauner, Michael; Kessler, Harald H; Lax, Sigurd F",Virchows arch,,650

The aim of this study was to retrospectively examine the clinical outcome of patients receiving in-hospital high-dose bolus cholecalciferol. Patients with a positive diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 and overt COVID-19, hospitalized from 15 March to 20 April 2020, were considered. Based on clinical characteristics, they were supplemented (or not) with 400,000 IU bolus oral cholecalciferol (200,000 IU administered in two consecutive days) and the composite outcome (transfer to intensive care unit; ICU and/or death) was recorded. Ninety-one patients (aged 74 ± 13 years) with COVID-19 were included in this retrospective study. Fifty (54.9%) patients presented with two or more comorbid diseases. Based on the decision of the referring physician, 36 (39.6%) patients were treated with vitamin D. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed a significant predictive power of the four variables: (a) low (<50 nmol/L) 25(OH) vitamin D levels, (b) current cigarette smoking, (c) elevated D-dimer levels (d) and the presence of comorbid diseases, to explain the decision to administer vitamin D (area under the curve = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.67-0.87, p < 0.0001). Over the follow-up period (14 ± 10 days), 27 (29.7%) patients were transferred to the ICU and 22 (24.2%) died (16 prior to ICU and six in ICU). Overall, 43 (47.3%) patients experienced the combined endpoint of transfer to ICU and/or death. Logistic regression analyses revealed that the comorbidity burden significantly modified the effect of vitamin D treatment on the study outcome, both in crude (p = 0.033) and propensity score-adjusted analyses (p = 0.039), so the positive effect of high-dose cholecalciferol on the combined endpoint was significantly amplified with increasing comorbidity burden. This hypothesis-generating study warrants the formal evaluation (i.e., clinical trial) of the potential benefit that cholecalciferol can offer in these comorbid COVID-19 patients.","Giannini, Sandro; Passeri, Giovanni; Tripepi, Giovanni; Sella, Stefania; Fusaro, Maria; Arcidiacono, Gaetano; Torres, Marco Onofrio; Michielin, Alberto; Prandini, Tancredi; Baffa, Valeria; Aghi, Andrea; Egan, Colin Gerard; Brigo, Martina; Zaninotto, Martina; Plebani, Mario; Vettor, Roberto; Fioretto, Paola; Rossini, Maurizio; Vignali, Alessandro; Fabris, Fabrizio; Bertoldo, Francesco",Nutrients,,650

In this study, a heterologous prime-boost immunization strategy for COVID-19 was designed to prime with a DNA vaccine encoding wild type (WT) spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) followed by S1 protein-based vaccine in rabbits. Four vaccine-elicited rabbit monoclonal antibodies (RmAbs), including 1H1, 9H1, 7G5, and 5E1, were isolated for biophysical property, neutralization potency and sequence analysis. All RmAbs recognized RBD or S1 protein with KD in the low nM or sub nM range. 1H1 and 9H1, but neither 7G5 nor 5E1, can bind to all RBD protein variants derived from B.1.351. All four RmAbs were able to neutralize wild type (WT) SARS-CoV-2 strain in pseudovirus assay, and 1H1 and 9H1 could neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 WT authentic virus with IC50 values of 0.136 and 0.026â µg/mL, respectively. Notably, 1H1 was able to neutralize all 6 emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants tested including D614G, B.1.1.7, B.1.429, P.1, B.1.526, and B.1.351 variants, and 5E1 could neutralize against the above 5 variants except P.1. Epitope binning analysis revealed that 9H1, 5E1 and 1H1 recognized distinct epitopes, while 9H1 and 7G5 may have overlapping but not identical epitope. In conclusion, DNA priming protein boost vaccination was an effective strategy to induce RmAbs with potent neutralization capability against not only SARS-CoV-2 WT strain but also emergent variants, which may provide a new avenue for effective therapeutics and point-of-care diagnostic measures.","Chen, Yuxin; Zhu, Liguo; Huang, Weijin; Tong, Xin; Wu, Hai; Tao, Yue; Tong, Bei; Huang, Haibin; Chen, Jiachen; Zhao, Xiangan; Lou, Yang; Wu, Chao",Emerg Microbes Infect,,650

227697,Overview of Targets and Potential Drugs of SARS-CoV-2 According to the Viral Replication,2021,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this case report was to describe the role of physical therapists in a neurosurgical center that was converted into a COVID-19 center for critically ill patients. METHODS (CASE DESCRIPTION): On March 16, 2020, the state government of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, determined that a neurosurgical center with 44 ICU beds equipped with mechanical ventilators should immediately transfer all patients with neurological conditions to other institutions and prepare for patients who were critically ill with COVID-19. The staff, including physical therapists, were trained to handle patients with COVID-19, many of whom were developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with complex and multifactorial ventilatory support needs. Adjustments were made to the physical therapy routine and protocols. Following the stabilization of patients' respiratory condition, physical therapist interventions focused on restoring physical function. RESULTS: A total of 116 confirmed COVID-19 cases were treated from March 17 to May 17, 2020. Sixty percent were men (70) and 40% were women (46), with a median age of 59 years. Eighty-nine percent (103) underwent mechanical ventilation during hospitalization, of which 11% (11) were successfully extubated. Thirty percent (31) of patients underwent tracheostomy, and 26% of those (8) were successfully decannulated. Of the total patients, 57 patients died (mortality rate of 49%), 4 (3%) were transferred to another institution, 23 (20%) were discharged home, and 32 (28%) continued to be hospitalized. CONCLUSION: Physical therapists in the ICU can facilitate care for critical events such as intubation, patient positioning, ventilatory adjustments, extubation, and functional training. IMPACT: The coronavirus pandemic has highlighted the importance of physical therapists, specifically in the care of patients who are critically ill with COVID-19. The availability and expertise of physical therapists in the ICU are important for managing critical events such as intubation, patient positioning, ventilatory adjustments, extubation, and functional training.","Gaspari, Clara H; Assumpção, Iana; Freire, Renata; Silva, Ariane; Santiso, Cintia; Jaccoud, Anna Carolina",Phys. ther,,650

Until recently, its treatment is mainly based on physical locations and meetings while being face to face. However, laser acupuncture tele-therapy approaches can significantly provide the patient with safety during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as changing the disorder's prognosis. Sixty patients were assigned randomly into 2 groups with 1:1 ratio. Patients in group A are treated remotely by laser acupuncture in addition to methotrexate and a tele-rehabilitation program in the form of aerobic exercise training. Patients in group B are treated by methotrexate and a tele-rehabilitation program in the form of aerobic exercise. There was a statistically significant difference in health assessment questionnaire (HAQ) pre- and post-treatment in group A (p < 0.05). The C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) inflammatory markers as well as the malondialdehyde (MDA) oxidative marker showed a significant reduction pre- and post-treatment in group A (p < 0.05). Additionally, there was a significant increase in the adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP) antioxidant marker pre- and post-treatment in group A (p < 0.05). The comparison between groups A and B showed a statistically significant post-treatment difference in RAQoL, CRP, IL-6, ATP, and MDA in group A than group B. Considering the significant improvement that was found in the laser acupuncture group, it can be concluded that the use of laser acupuncture as adjunctive was effective in the treatment of elderly patients with RA.

Compliance with the rules was found to reduce the risk of psychological response. CONCLUSIONS: The risk factors for the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and acknowledging these factors can help to formulate the interventions to reduce the stress levels of the population.","Cansel, Neslihan; Ucuz, Ilknur; Arslan, Ahmet Kadir; Kayhan Tetik, Burcu; Colak, Cemil; Melez, Sahide Nur Ipek; Sule Gümüstakim, Raziye; Ceylan, Sinem; Zeren Öztürk, Güzin; Kiliç Öztürk, Yasemin; Cadirci, Dursun; Semra Demir Akca, Ayse",Int J Clin Pract,,650

However, few studies assessed these effects longitudinally during the peak of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The goals of this study were to explore whether differential effects of COVID-19 restrictions on mental health could be observed by sex and age in a Luxembourgish nationally representative sample during the initial outbreak of COVID-19. Furthermore, we aimed to assess whether there are differences in risk and protective factors longitudinally at two assessment times. A total of 1,756 respondents aged 18 years and older (50.74% women) reported sociodemographic and socio-economic characteristics, depression, anxiety, stress, and loneliness. Women and younger respondents reported higher rates of severe depression and anxiety symptoms, suggesting higher vulnerability to the pandemic control measures. This study contributes to the investigation of mental health consequences of the pandemic and the pandemic control measures, particularly related to shifts in care task responsibilities, gender and socio-economic inequalities, as well as younger groups' uncertainty about the future.","Ribeiro, Fabiana; Schröder, Valerie E; Krüger, Rejko; Leist, Anja K",Psychiatry Res,,650

Most of the initial infection cases manifest as acute epithelial keratitis. Reactivation of herpesviruses is common in critically ill patients, including patients with severe Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). However, the data on COVID-19-related ocular infections is sparse, despite recent observations that more than 30% of COVID-19-infected patients had ocular manifestations. We report five cases of HSV-1 keratitis in COVID-19 patients. In total, five COVID-19 patients underwent ophthalmic examination, showing similar symptoms, including photophobia, tearing, decreased vision, eye redness, and pain. After initial assessment, tests of visual acuity and corneal sensitivity, a fluorescein staining test, and complete anterior and posterior segment examinations were performed. A diagnosis of HSV-1 keratitis was confirmed in all cases. Therapy was initiated using a local and systemic antiviral approach together with local antibiotic and mydriatic therapy. The complete reduction of keratitis symptoms and a clear cornea was achieved in all patients within 2 weeks. SARS-CoV-2 infection may be a risk factor for developing HSV-1 keratitis, or it may act as a potential activator of this ocular disease.","Majtanova, Nora; Kriskova, Petra; Keri, Petra; Fellner, Zlatica; Majtan, Juraj; Kolar, Petr",Medicina (Kaunas),,650

After the virus first emerged in late 2019, the first intervention that demonstrated significant reductions in mortality for severe COVID-19 in large-scale trials was corticosteroids. Additional options that may reduce the burden on the healthcare system by reducing the number of patients requiring intensive care unit support are desperately needed, yet no therapy has conclusively established benefit in randomized studies for the management of moderate or mild cases of disease. Severe COVID-19 disease is characterized by a respiratory distress syndrome accompanied by elevated levels of several systemic cytokines, in a profile that shares several features with known inflammatory pathologies such as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and cytokine release syndrome secondary to chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy. Based on these observations, modulation of inflammatory cytokines, particularly interleukin (IL)-6, was proposed as a strategy to mitigate severe disease. Despite encouraging recoveries with anti-IL-6 agents, especially tocilizumab from single-arm studies, early randomized trials returned mixed results in terms of clinical benefit with these interventions. Later, larger trials such as RECOVERY and REMAP-CAP, however, are establishing anti-IL-6 in combination with steroids as a potential option for hypoxic patients with evidence of hyperinflammation. We propose that a positive feedback loop primarily mediated by macrophages and monocytes initiates the inflammatory cascade in severe COVID-19, and thus optimal benefit with anti-IL-6 therapies may require intervention during a finite window of opportunity at the outset of hyperinflammation but before fulminant disease causes irreversible tissue damage-as defined clinically by C reactive protein levels higher than 75 mg/L.","Ascierto, Paolo Antonio; Fu, Binqing; Wei, Haiming",J. immunotherap. cancer,,650

Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) were first identified in the mid-1960s and have been known to cause enteric or respiratory infections. In the last two decades, three HCoVs have emerged, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which initiated the ongoing pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 causes a respiratory illness that presents as a mild upper respiratory disease but may result in acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure and can be fatal, especially when underlying comorbidities are present. Children account for a low percentage of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases, with seemingly less severe disease. Most pediatric patients present mild or moderate symptoms or are asymptomatic. However, some cases may be severe. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 in pediatric patients must be studied in detail. This review describes general features of the molecular biology of CoVs and virus-host interactions that may be implicated in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2.","Hidalgo, Paloma; Valdés, Margarita; González, Ramón A",Bol Med Hosp Infant Mex,,650
235578,"Origin, evolution and global spread of SARS-CoV-2",2020,"We argue that we should provide extra payment not only for extra time worked but also for the extra risks healthcare workers (and those working in healthcare settings) incur while caring for COVID-19 patients-and more generally when caring for patients poses them at significantly higher risks than normal. We argue that the extra payment is warranted regardless of whether healthcare workers have a professional obligation to provide such risky healthcare. Payment for risk would meet four essential ethical requirements. First, assuming healthcare workers do not have a professional obligation to take on themselves the risks, payments in the form of incentives would preserve autonomy in deciding what risks to take on oneself. Second, even assuming that healthcare workers do have a professional obligation to take on themselves the risks, payments for risk would create fair working conditions by avoiding exploitation. Third, payments for risk would make it more likely that public healthcare systems can discharge their institutional responsibility to provide healthcare in circumstances where healthcare workers may otherwise (perhaps legitimately) opt out. Fourth, payments for risk would guarantee an efficient healthcare system in pandemic situations. Finally, we address two likely objections that some might raise against our proposal, particularly with regard to incentives, namely that such payments or incentives can themselves be coercive and that they represent a form of undue inducement.","Giubilini, Alberto; Savulescu, Julian",Bioethics,,650

A total of 1091 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia were included from Wuhan, China. Overall, 2.8% (n = 31) received invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), 10.8% (n = 118) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), 6.4% (n = 70) developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and 4.4% (n = 48) died. Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) (95% confidence intervals [CIs]) of IMV therapy, ICU admission and ARDS associated with obesity were 2.86 (1.16-7.05), 2.62 (1.52-4.49) and 3.15 (1.69-5.88), respectively; underweight was significantly associated with death (HR 3.85, 95%CI 1.26-11.76). Restricted cubic spline analyses suggested U-shaped associations of BMI with ICU admission and death, but linear relationships of BMI with IMV therapy and ARDS. In conclusion, obesity had an increased risk of IMV therapy, ICU admission and ARDS, while underweight was associated with higher mortality in COVID-19 pneumonia. U-shaped associations of BMI with ICU admission and death, and linear relationships of BMI with IMV therapy and ARDS, were found. These findings indicate that extra caution should be taken when treating COVID-19 patients with underweight and obesity.","Wu, Xiaodong; Li, Chenghong; Chen, Shi; Zhang, Xin; Wang, Feilong; Shi, Ting; Li, Qiang; Lin, Lin",Aging (Albany NY),,650

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is responsible for the vast majority of pancreatic cancer cases, and is characterised by the presence of a dense stroma that impacts therapeutic efficacy and drives pro-tumorigenic programs. More specifically, the inflammatory nature of the tumour microenvironment is thought to underlie the loss of anti-tumour immunity and development of resistance to current treatments. Inflammatory pathways are largely mediated by the expression of, and signalling through, cytokines, chemokines, and other cellular messengers. In recent years, there has been much attention focused on dual targeting of cancer cells and the tumour microenvironment. Here we review our current understanding of the role of IL-6, and the broader IL-6 cytokine family, in pancreatic cancer, including their contribution to pancreatic inflammation and various roles in pancreatic cancer pathogenesis. We also summarise potential opportunities for therapeutic targeting of these pathways as an avenue towards combating poor patient outcomes.","van Duijneveldt, Gemma; Griffin, Michael D W; Putoczki, Tracy L",Clin Sci (Lond),,650

The dramatic increase in the number of cases and deaths have placed tremendous strain on health care systems worldwide. As health care workers and society adjust to focus treatment and prevention of COVID-19, other facets of the health care enterprise are affected, particularly surgical volume and revenue. The purpose of this study was to describe the financial impact of COVID-19 on an academic neurosurgery department. METHODS: A retrospective review of weekly average daily work relative value units (wRVUs) were compared before and after COVID-19 in the fiscal year 2020. A comparative time period of the same months in the year prior was also included for review. We also review strategies for triaging neurosurgical disease as needing emergent, urgent, or routine operative treatment. RESULTS: Daily average wRVU after COVID-19 dropped significantly with losses in all weeks examined. Of the 7 weeks in the current post-COVID period, the weekly daily average wRVU was 173 (range, 128-363). The mean decline was 51.4% compared with the pre-COVID era. Both inpatient and outpatient revenue was affected.

Exact-match is one of the most essential operations widely used in almost every step of genomics such as alignment, assembly, annotation, and compression. Modern genomics adopts Ferragina-Manzini Index (FM-Index) augmenting space-efficient Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT) with additional data structures to permit ultra-fast exact-match operations. However, FM-Index is notorious for its poor spatial locality and random memory access pattern. Prior works create GPU-, FPGA-, ASIC- and even process-in-memory (PIM)-based accelerators to boost FM-Index search throughput. Though they achieve the state-of-the-art FM-Index search throughput, the same as all prior conventional accelerators, FM-Index PIMs process only one DNA symbol after each DRAM row activation, thereby suffering from poor memory bandwidth utilization. In this paper, we propose a hardware accelerator, EXMA, to enhance FM-Index search throughput. We first create a novel EXMA table with a multi-task-learning (MTL)-based index to process multiple DNA symbols with each DRAM row activation. We then build an accelerator to search over an EXMA table. We propose 2-stage scheduling to increase the cache hit rate of our accelerator. We introduce dynamic page policy to improve the row buffer hit rate of DRAM main memory. We also present CHAIN compression to reduce the data structure size of EXMA tables. Compared to state-of-the-art FM-Index PIMs, EXMA improves search throughput by $4.9\times$, and enhances search throughput per Watt by $4.8\times$.","Jiang, Lei; Zokaee, Farzaneh",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.05314v1.pdf,650

Our aim was to compare the clinical outcomes of patients with and without T2DM during the first hit of COVID-19 in Istanbul. METHODS: A retrospective population-based study was conducted including all consecutive adult symptomatic COVID-19 cases. Patients were confirmed with rt-PCR; treated and monitored in accordance with standard protocols. The primary endpoints were hospitalization and 30-day mortality. RESULTS: Of the 93,571 patients, 22.6% had T2DM, with older age and higher BMI. Propensity Score matched evaluation resulted in significantly higher rates of hospitalization (1.5-fold), 30-day mortality (1.6-fold), and pneumonia (1.4-fold). They revealed more severe laboratory deviations, comorbidities, and frequent drug usage than the Non-DM group. In T2DM age, pneumonia, hypertension, obesity, and insulin-based therapies were associated with an increased likelihood of hospitalization; whereas age, male gender, lymphopenia, obesity, and insulin treatment were considerably associated with higher odds of death. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients with T2DM had worse clinical outcomes with higher hospitalization and 30-day mortality rates than those without diabetes. Compared to most territories of the world, COVID-19 mortality was much lower in Istanbul, which may be associated with accessible healthcare provision and the younger structure of the population.","Satman, Ilhan; Demirci, Ibrahim; Haymana, Cem; Tasci, Ilker; Salman, Serpil; Ata, Naim; Dagdelen, Selcuk; Sahin, Ibrahim; Emral, Rifat; Cakal, Erman; Atmaca, Aysegul; Sahin, Mustafa; Celik, Osman; Demir, Tevfik; Ertugrul, Derun; Unluturk, Ugur; Arga, Kazim Yalcin; Caglayan, Murat; Sonmez, Alper",Diabetes Res Clin Pract,,650
244357,Modeling SARS-CoV-2 RNA Degradation in Small and Large Sewersheds,2021,"In nursing education, virtual simulations are used to augment in-person simulation and prepare and supplement students for clinical placements. More recently, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, virtual simulations are being used to replace clinical hours. Many virtual simulations require the user to make decisions that affect the outcome of the simulated experience. In this article, we provide a historical account of the virtual gaming simulations that members of our team developed and the processes that led to successful uptake into curriculum. In addition, we share lessons learned from our experiences in terms of maximizing curricular uptake. We found engagement of the teaching team is essential when using VGS in a course. In addition, when using VGS, it is important to follow the process of prebrief, enactment, debrief and evaluation. Educators can build on and grow from our lessons learned so that the path to embedding virtual gaming simulation in curriculum becomes clear.","Verkuyl, Margaret; Lapum, Jennifer L; St-Amant, Oona; Hughes, Michelle; Romaniuk, Daria",Nurse Educ Pract,,650

A 23-year-old woman with obvious abdominal distension visited our hospital. The patient was not pregnant and had not undergone controlled superovulation. Apart from abdominal distension, the patient denied any symptom of obvious incentives, abdominal pain, abnormal vaginal bleeding, or drainage. Biochemical analysis showed a high carbohydrate antigen-125 level and low total protein and albumin levels. Abdominal ultrasound and computed tomography showed a large amount of ascites and cystic uneven masses with an irregular shape in the area of the ovaries and fallopian tubes. Post-surgical histopathology indicated the diagnosis of sOHSS. Wedge resection of both ovaries was performed. Symptomatic treatment was further performed and the patient recovered well. Our findings indicate that sOHSS can occur in women who are not pregnant. Additionally, besides the follicle-stimulating hormone receptor gene mutation hypothesis, the pathogenesis of sOHSS should be further studied.","Chai, Wei; He, Hongyu; Li, Fei; Zhang, Wenlei; He, Chao",J Int Med Res,,650

Past studies have shown inadequate maintenance practices but how far regarding Nigerian public hospital buildings is yet to receive empirical research. This paper aims to investigate the underlying issues leading to inadequate maintenance practices and proffers policy options to improve Nigerian public hospital buildings via an unexplored dimension. Design/methodology/approach The study used a mixed research design method involving both qualitative and quantitative data. First, results from the qualitative phase were analysed and verified at the quantitative phase through a well-structured questionnaire, developed from the qualitative findings across hospital maintenance experts (work/maintenance department, health-care provider, design team and health-care building/service contractor) in Abuja, Lagos and Benin City. Findings Insufficient funds for maintenance works, absence of planned maintenance programmes, inadequately trained personnel, etc., emerged as the maintenance inadequacies in the public hospital buildings across the cities covered. The paper categorised the cause of inadequate maintenance practices of public hospital buildings into six groups: statutory requirements, design stage, construction stage, budget for maintenance task, managing maintenance unit activities and user's perception regarding maintenance management. Research limitations/implications This paper is limited to maintenance practices of Nigerian public hospital buildings. Future research is needed to evaluate factors that will enhance outsourcing maintenance and the use of the 4th industrial revolution (building information modelling for refurbishment and building automation systems) amongst others in maintenance practices of public hospital buildings. Practical implications As part of the practical implication, the government and hospital administrators should make provision for adequate funding and accountability of annual maintenance budgetary allocation. Also, the government should establish a national maintenance policy for public infrastructure with an emphasis on preventive maintenance and contractor's reputation, outstanding pedigree, technical and financial soundness during build maintenance contract award, etc., were recommended. Originality/value This paper reveals that the stakeholders, especially hospital administrators, policymakers and political office holders that are concern with maintenance budget, approval and disbursement concerning maintenance practices in public hospital buildings need to reawaken to her responsibility because of the inadequate implementation across the cities covered.","Ebekozien, A.; Duru, O.

Studies commonly acknowledge these models' assumptions but less often justify their validity in the specific context in which they are being used. Our purpose is not to argue for specific alternatives or modifications to compartmental models, but rather to show how assumptions can constrain model outcomes to a narrow portion of the wide landscape of potential epidemic behaviors. This concrete examination of well-known models also serves to illustrate general principles of modeling that can be applied in other contexts.","Kollepara, Pratyush K.; Siegenfeld, Alexander F.; Bar-Yam, Yaneer",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.02947v1.pdf,650

Additionally, the basic reproduction number (R0) and number of infectors and patients who left Hubei were estimated using the coordinate descent algorithm. The median R0 at the initial stage of the epidemic was 4.97 (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.82-5.17). Before the traffic lockdown was implemented in Hubei, 2000 (95% CI 1982-2030) infectors and patients had left Hubei and traveled throughout the country. The model estimated that if the government had taken prevention and control measures 1 day later, the cumulative number of laboratory-confirmed patients in the whole country would have increased by 32.1%. If the lockdown of Hubei was imposed 1 day in advance, the cumulative number of laboratory-confirmed patients in other provinces would have decreased by 7.7%. The stochastic model could fit the officially issued data well and simulate the evolution process of the epidemic.

253999,Disparate temperature-dependent virus-host dynamics for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the human respiratory epithelium,2021,"Infection of certain influenza viruses is triggered when its HA is cleaved by host cell proteases such as proprotein convertases and type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSP). HA with a monobasic motif is cleaved by trypsin-like proteases, including TMPRSS2 and HAT, whereas the multibasic motif found in high pathogenicity avian influenza HA is cleaved by furin, PC5/6, or MSPL. MSPL belongs to the TMPRSS family and preferentially cleaves [R/K]-K-K-R&#8595; sequences. Here, we solved the crystal structure of the extracellular region of human MSPL in complex with an irreversible substrate-analog inhibitor. The structure revealed three domains clustered around the C-terminal &#945;-helix of the SPD. The inhibitor structure and its putative model show that the P1-Arg inserts into the S1 pocket, whereas the P2-Lys and P4-Arg interacts with the Asp/Glu-rich 99-loop that is unique to MSPL. Based on the structure of MSPL, we also constructed a homology model of TMPRSS2, which is essential for the activation of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and infection. The model may provide the structural insight for the drug development for COVID-19.","Ohno, Ayako; Maita, Nobuo; Tabata, Takanori; Nagano, Hikaru; Arita, Kyohei; Ariyoshi, Mariko; Uchida, Takayuki; Nakao, Reiko; Ulla, Anayt; Sugiura, Kosuke; Kishimoto, Koji; Teshima-Kondo, Shigetada; Okumura, Yuushi; Nikawa, Takeshi",,,650

Methods: Twenty-one 3-month-old male ordinary New Zealand white rabbits were numbered 1 to 42 on the left and right parietal bones. They were divided into 5 groups using a random number table, the control group (group A, 6 sides) and the material group 1, 2, 3, 4 (respectively group B, C, D, E, 9 sides in each group). All animals were prepared with 12-mm-diameter skull defect models, and bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) non-covalently bound multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT)-COOH+poly ( L-lactide) (PLLA), BMP-2 non-covalently bound MWCNT-NH 2+PLLA, BMP-2 covalently bound MWCNT-COOH+PLLA, and BMP-2 covalently bound MWCNT-NH 2+PLLA were implanted into the defects of groups B, C, D, and E, respectively. At 4, 8, and 12 weeks after operation, the samples were taken for CT scanning and three-dimensional reconstruction, the ratio of bone tissue regeneration volume to total volume and bone mineral density were measured, and the histological observation of HE staining and Masson trichrome staining were performed to quantitatively analyze the volume ratio of new bone tissue. Results: CT scanning and three-dimensional reconstruction showed that with the extension of time, the defects in groups A-E were filled gradually, and the defect in group E was completely filled at 12 weeks after operation. HE staining and Masson trichrome staining showed that the volume of new bone tissue in each group gradually increased with time, and regenerated mature bone tissue appeared in groups D and E at 12 weeks after operation. Quantitative analysis showed that at 4, 8, and 12 weeks after operation, the ratio of bone tissue regeneration volume to total volume, bone mineral density, and the volume ratio of new bone tissue increased gradually over time; and at each time point, the above indexes increased gradually from group A to group E, and the differences between groups were significant ( P<0.05). Conclusion: Through covalent binding and using -NH 2 to bound peptides with materials, the best bone repair effect can be achieved.","Di, Yuntao; Wang, Cunyang; Zhu, Huixue; Yu, Suxiang; Ren, Yixing; Li, Xiaoming",Zhongguo Xiu Fu Chong Jian Wai Ke Za Zhi,,650

255923,SARS-CoV-2 in Detroit Wastewater,2020,"BACKGROUND: Thrombin, a key enzyme of the clotting system, is involved in thrombus formation, platelet activation, and atherosclerosis, thereby possessing a central role in the pathogenesis of ischemic heart disease. Studies have shown an association between thrombin generation (TG) and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, but results have been equivocal. Our aim was to study the predictive ability of TG assay in evaluating coronary stenosis severity. METHODS: In this prospective study we recruited patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or acute chest pain (without evidence of myocardial injury) planned for coronary angiography. Thrombin generation was evaluated by Calibrated Automated Thrombogram (CAT) prior to angiography. Primary end points were significant coronary stenosis and the Syntax I score evaluated by coronary angiography. RESULTS: From April 2018 through September 2019, we recruited 128 patients. In the primary analysis there was no significant association between TG and significant coronary stenosis nor between TG and syntax I score, however, there was a positive correlation between peak height and troponin peak (Spearman correlation coefficient 0.194, P-value = 0.035). In sub-group analysis, the chest pain group bare no association between TG and coronary stenosis. In unstable angina group there was an association between peak height and significant coronary stenosis (P-value = 0.029), and in non ST-elevation myocardial infarction group, TG values possessed a relatively good predictive ability of significant coronary stenosis (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of ~65%) and a positive correlation between both lag time and ttpeak with the syntax I score was noticed (Spearman correlation coefficient 0.31, P-value = 0.099 and Spearman correlation coefficient 0.37, P-value = 0.045 respectively). CONCLUSION: In patients with acute chest pain, TG values, evaluated by CAT, do not predict severity of coronary stenosis, nor do they possess prognostic value. Yet, in ACS patients, TG may have the ability to predict coronary disease severity.","Elad, Boaz; Koren, Ofir; Slim, Wasin; Turgeman, Yoav; Avraham, Gilat; Schwartz, Naama; Elias, Mazen",PLoS One,,650

This analysis is based on Austrians who had a job prior to the pandemic and who were still working during the survey (whether they worked from home or commuted). Using data from the survey, this article examines changes in the mode of workplace of those who switched to e-commuting. Additionally, the authors were interested in finding out to what extent the e-commuting agreement reduces commuting. The following were done: a systematic review of e-commuting literature, a cross-tabulation of data to examine relationships within data, a McNemar test for workplace examination and a Friedman test with pairwise comparisons for commuting analysis. The data show that the number of e-commuters increased in almost all the surveyed periods except between the pre-Covid time and the easing of the lockdown. The e-working proportion increased on average by 59.74%. Results suggest that the frequency of commutes by cubicles differs significantly in all periods except between the first and second lockdowns, and by e-workers between February and the first lockdown and the easing and the second lockdown. If we look at the average rankings, we see that during the second lockdown, the frequency of cubicle commutes decreased significantly and that of e-workers increased.","Beno, M.",Ad Alta-Journal of Interdisciplinary Research,,650

METHODS: We conducted targeted surveillance for MIS-C from March 15 to May 20, 2020, in pediatric health centers across the United States. The case definition included six criteria: serious illness leading to hospitalization, an age of less than 21 years, fever that lasted for at least 24 hours, laboratory evidence of inflammation, multisystem organ involvement, and evidence of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) based on reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), antibody testing, or exposure to persons with Covid-19 in the past month. Clinicians abstracted the data onto standardized forms. RESULTS: We report on 186 patients with MIS-C in 26 states. The median age was 8.3 years, 115 patients (62%) were male, 135 (73%) had previously been healthy, 131 (70%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR or antibody testing, and 164 (88%) were hospitalized after April 16, 2020. Organ-system involvement included the gastrointestinal system in 171 patients (92%), cardiovascular in 149 (80%), hematologic in 142 (76%), mucocutaneous in 137 (74%), and respiratory in 131 (70%). The median duration of hospitalization was 7 days (interquartile range, 4 to 10); 148 patients (80%) received intensive care, 37 (20%) received mechanical ventilation, 90 (48%) received vasoactive support, and 4 (2%) died. Coronary-artery aneurysms (z scores &#8805;2.5) were documented in 15 patients (8%), and Kawasaki's disease-like features were documented in 74 (40%). Most patients (171 [92%]) had elevations in at least four biomarkers indicating inflammation.

DESIGN: Retrospective study. ANIMALS: Fifty-nine dogs (63 hemipelves). METHODS: Radiographs and medical records of dogs with ilial fractures presented to Iowa State University between 2003 and 2019 were reviewed. After fracture reduction, fractures were fixed with a locking plate system (LPS) or non-locking plate system (NLS). Perioperative, long-term complications, and follow-up data were recorded. The frequency of implant failure and pelvic collapse were compared using a logistic and linear regression analysis, respectively. Where the univariate test was statistically significant, a multivariate analysis across categories was performed to identify statistically different categories. RESULTS: LPS and NLS implants were used in 25/63 and 38/63 hemipelves, respectively. Median follow-up time was 8 weeks (3-624 weeks). Implant failure occurred in 18/63 (29%) of fracture repairs, consisting of 17 with NLS and 1 with LPS. Revision surgery was recommended in five cases of implant failure, all with NLS. The probability of implant failure was higher when fractures were fixed with NLS (p = .0056). All other variables evaluated did not seem to influence outcome measures. CONCLUSION: The variable with the most influence on the outcomes of dogs treated for ilial fractures consisted of the fixation method (NLS vs. LPS). Fractures repaired with NLS were nearly 20 times more likely to fail than those repaired with LPS. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Surgeons should consider repairing ilial body fractures in dogs with LPS to reduce the risk of short-term implant failure.","Petrovsky, Brian; Knuth, Taylor; Aponte-Colón, Cristina; Hoefle, William; Kraus, Karl; Naiman, Jaron; Yuan, Lingnan; Mochel, Jonathan P; Zellner, Eric",Vet. surg,,650

261239,Genomic epidemiology reveals transmission patterns and dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in Aotearoa New Zealand,2020,"Pneumonia caused by COVID-19 is a severe health risk that sometimes leads to fatal outcomes. Due to constraints in medical care systems, technological solutions should be applied to diagnose, monitor, and alert about the disease's progress for patients receiving care at home. Some sleep disturbances, such as obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, can increase the risk for COVID-19 patients. This paper proposes an approach to evaluating patients' sleep quality with the aim of detecting sleep disturbances caused by pneumonia and other COVID-19-related pathologies. We describe a non-invasive sensor network that is used for sleep monitoring and evaluate the feasibility of an approach for training a machine learning model to detect possible COVID-19-related sleep disturbances. We also discuss a cloud-based approach for the implementation of the proposed system for processing the data streams. Based on the preliminary results, we conclude that sleep disturbances are detectable with affordable and non-invasive sensors.","Dimitrievski, Ace; Zdravevski, Eftim; Lameski, Petre; Villasana, María Vanessa; Miguel Pires, Ivan; Garcia, Nuno M; Flórez-Revuelta, Francisco; Trajkovik, Vladimir",Sensors (Basel),,650

In this paper we focus in detail on the impact of, and experiences with, working from home (WFH), perhaps the largest of the positive unintended consequence of the pandemic, with respect to transport, and a key lens through which the changing patterns in travel activity and attitudes discussed in Part 1 need to be understood. We conclude that through the widespread adoption of WFH as a result of nationwide public health orders, there is evidence emerging that WFH is now seen as an appealing instrument of change by employees and employers, there is growing support to continue to support WFH into the future. This represents a significant potential contribution to the future management of the transport network, especially in larger metropolitan areas.

In vivo ocular feasibility and pharmacokinetics after intravitreal and suprachoroidal administration in rabbit eyes are compared against intravitreal administration of a DEX solution (1 mg/ml). Thirty rabbit eyes were injected with the DEX/LAP formulation (15 suprachoroid / 15 intravitreous). Ophthalmological signs were monitored at day 1 and at weeks 1-4-12-24 post-administration. Three eyes per sample time point were used to quantify DEX concentration using high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The ocular tissues' pharmacokinetic parameters (lens, vitreous humour, choroid-retina unit and sclera) were studied. DEX/LAP was well tolerated under both administration methods. Peak intraocular DEX levels from the DEX/LAP were detected in the vitreous humour after both deliveries soon after administration. The vitreous area under the curve was significantly greater after both DEX/LAP deliveries (intravitreal: 205968.47; suprachoroidal: 11442.22 ng/g*day) than after intravitreal administration of the DEX solution (317.17 ng/g*day). Intravitreal DEX/LAP delivery extended higher vitreous DEX levels up to week 24 (466.32 ± 311.15 ng/g). With suprachoroidal delivery, DEX levels were detectable in the choroid-retina unit (12.04 ± 20.85 ng/g) and sclera (25.46 ± 44.09 ng/g) up to week 24. This study demonstrated the intraocular feasibility of both suprachoroidal and intravitreal administration of the DEX/LAP formulation. The Laponite increased the intraocular retention time of dexamethasone when compared with conventional solutions. DEX/LAP could be considered a biocompatible and useful sustained-release formulation for treating posterior-pole eye diseases.","Prieto, Esther; Cardiel, Maria Jose; Vispe, Eugenio; Idoipe, Miriam; Garcia-Martin, Elena; Fraile, Jose Maria; Polo, Vicente; Mayoral, Jose Antonio; Pablo, Luis Emilio; Rodrigo, Maria Jesus",,,650
267167,A monoclonal antibody against staphylococcal enterotoxin B superantigen inhibits SARS-CoV-2 entry in vitro,2021,"Significance The emerging technologies such as the Internet of Things and wearable technology in recent decades have brought great changes and convenience with better healthcare and manufacturing and higher safety, security, and efficiency for the whole society As an essential important link in these systems, sensors provide key value proposition and play a pivotal role Take wearable electronics as examples, the market value of wearable technology has doubled in the past five years Sensors have provided core functions for many different products during the development of wearable electronics, and they will continue to play a key role in future generation of products For example, smartwatches and skin patches are built based on the fitness tracking and daily activity data, and are used for medical measurement Virtual, augmented, and mixed reality devices rely on a set of sensors (e g inertial measurement unit, depth induction, force/pressure sensors) to enable users to interact with the content and environment Moreover, the transition from traditional human-computer interaction to a natural user interface will also depend on further advances in sensors Other products in different areas, such as autonomous vehicles, air detector, and smart clothing, are similar and depend on a set of core sensors that can interact with the body or the surrounding environment Some of these sensor systems have been gradually commercialized and expanded to more industrial, agricultural, military, environmental, and safety applications In particular, the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 has also brought increased attention to sensors owing to their promising applications in tracking early onset and potential virus contacts, and remote patient monitoring of isolated patients In short, the sensor remains a fundamental component of the entire product line, which has been required to be thinner, lighter, smaller, more flexible, and sensitive in the new application systems Based on the important role of sensors, many preparation methods such as vapor deposition, lithography, nano-imprint lithography as well as printing have been developed Each technology has its unique advantages and adapts to different scenarios At the same time, their disadvantages that cannot be ignored also need to be addressed For instance, chemical and physical vapor deposition methods, including thermal evaporation, vacuum evaporation, magnetron sputtering, and molecular beam epitaxy, can produce high-quality materials and devices with good performance, but these technologies usually require expensive equipment and specific operating environment Moreover, it is difficult for these techniques to be compatible with flexible substrates and realize low-cost industrialized mass production In addition, photolithography and nano-imprint lithography are suitable for precision device fabrication However, they often face the challenges of low processing efficiency, low output, high cost due to the complex processing process, high design cost of mask, and long processing cycle In comparison, printing is a very attractive technology for low-cost large scale production But in most cases, the presence of mask limits the precision and resolution of the prepared micro/nano-sized devices Therefore, with the increasing demand for flexible, wearable, miniaturized, precise, integrated, and customized sensors, the new processing method with higher precision and more flexibility manners is needed to achieve controllable preparation To meet the developmental requirements of sensors, various processing techniques mentioned above are utilized to optimize and improve the sensor mainly from the aspects of the electrode, sensing material, and whole device In recent decade, laser micro-nano fabrication has been gradually developed and popular in the field of manufacturing The laser micro-nano fabrication changes the material state and property through the laser-material interaction and realizes the well-control of shape and property across scales With the advantages of large proc ssing speed, high precision, strong controllability, easy integration, and high compatibility with materials, the sensor fabricated by laser has ushered in a new development in structure regulation and performance optimization However, it still faces challenges and difficulties in mass production and efficiency promotion in practical applications Progress The laser processing technologies for the fabrication of sensors and sensing systems of different stimulus sources are summarized (Fig 2) Firstly, three laser processing modes widely used in sensor production including laser induced heating, reaction, and delamination are introduced The convenience and advantages of laser processing compared with those of the traditional processing technology can be clearly understood in the section of laser processing modes (Fig 3) Then, based on the existing research results, the sensor systems prepared by laser are classified into ultraviolet, gas, humidity, temperature, strain/stress, biology, and environmental monitoring sensors It is easily found that the advantages of laser micro-nano fabrication are mainly reflected in the following three aspects 1) Laser micro-nano fabrication has broadened the preparation approaches of electrodes and sensing materials It can realize in-situ or non-in-situ preparation of conductive electrodes and sensing materials by laser reduction, sintering, annealing, ablation, pulse deposition, laser induced carbonization, and hydrothermal reaction as well as other specific laser processing technologies, which provide alternative strategies for material preparation 2) Laser micro-nano fabrication simplifies the assembly process of the whole device The laser direct writing technology can realize in situ selective process in specific areas or specific materials, leading to great convenience for device construction Moreover, the whole sensor on flexible substrates can even be prepared by one-step laser fabrication through digital design 3) Laser micro-nano fabrication contributes to promote sensor performance Sensing material, as a key part of a single sensor, can be modified and regulated by laser processing, thus providing the possibility of performance optimization With these optimizations and improvements, the sensors become softer, smaller, and more customized and have higher integration Finally, we also analyze the problems existing in sensors fabricated by laser micro-nano fabrication, such as insufficient researches on laser-material interaction, limited processing accuracy and efficiency enhancement, and low level of device integration Conclusions and Prospect Laser micro-nano fabrication has gradually become a common and popular technology for sensing system preparation and integration To sum up, the sensor fabricated by laser still needs in-depth and detailed exploration to promote the development of commercialization and industrialization of the sensor

269370,Experimental Inoculation of Young Calves with SARS-CoV-2,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Previous investigations have identified high rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection among residents and staff in care homes reporting an outbreak of COVID-19. We investigated care homes reporting a single suspected or confirmed case to assess whether early mass testing might reduce risk of transmission during the peak of the pandemic in London. METHODS: Between 18-27 April 2020, residents and staff in care homes reporting a single case of COVID-19 to Public Health England had a nasal swab to test for SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR and subsequent whole genome sequencing. Residents and staff in two care homes were re-tested eight days later. RESULTS: Four care homes were investigated. SARS-CoV-2 positivity was 20% (65/333) overall, ranging between 3-59%. Among residents, positivity ranged between 3-76% compared to 3-40% in staff. Half of the SARS-CoV-2 positive residents (23/46, 50%) and 63% of staff (12/19) reported symptoms within 14 days before or after testing. Repeat testing 8 days later in two care homes with the highest infection rates identified only two new cases. Genomic analysis demonstrated a small number of introductions of the virus into care homes, and distinct clusters within three of the care homes. CONCLUSIONS: We found extensive but variable rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection among residents and staff in care homes reporting a single case of COVID-19. While routine whole home testing has now been adopted into practice, care homes must remain vigilant and should be encouraged to report a single suspected case, which should trigger appropriate outbreak control measures.","Tang, Suzanne; Perez, Marina Sanchez; Saavedra-Campos, Maria; Paranthaman, Karthik; Myers, Richard; Fok, Jonathan; Crawley-Boevey, Emma; Dun-Campbell, Kate; Janarthanan, Roshni; Fernandez, Elena; Vusirikala, Amoolya; Patel, Bharat; Ma, Thomas; Amin-Chowdhury, Zahin; Shetty, Nandini; Zambon, Maria; Bell, Anita; Wynne-Evans, Edward; Chow, Yimmy; Ladhani, Shamez",Age ageing,,650

When compared to non-immunocompromised patients, onco-hematological patients seem to have higher mortality rates. AIMS: We describe the characteristics and outcomes of a consecutive cohort of 24 onco-hematological patients with COVID-19 during the first month of the pandemic. We also describe variations in healthcare resource utilization within our hematology department. METHODS AND RESULTS: Data from patients between the first month of the pandemic were retrospectively collected. Clinical and logistic data were also collected and compared with the average values from the prior 3 months of activity. Prevalence of COVID-19 in our hematological population was 0.4%. Baseline characteristics were as follows: male sex: 83%, lymphoid diseases: 46%, median age: 69 (22-82) years. Median follow-up in survivors was 14 (9-28) days and inpatient mortality rate was 46%. Average time to moderate/severe respiratory insufficiency and death were 3 (1-10) and 10 (3-18) days, respectively. Only 1 out of every 12 patients who developed moderate to severe respiratory insufficiency recovered. Upon univariate analysis, the following factors were associated with higher mortality: age &#8805; 70 years (P = .01) and D-dimer &#8805;900 mcg/L (P = .04). With respect to indirect effects during the COVID-19 pandemic, and when compared with the prior 3 months of activity, inpatient mortality (excluding patients with COVID-19 included in the study) increased by 56%. This was associated with a more frequent use of vasoactive drugs (+300%) and advanced respiratory support (+133%) in the hematology ward. In the outpatient setting, there was a reduction in initial visits (-55%) and chemotherapy sessions (-19%). A significant increase in phone visits was reported (+581%). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pandemic is associated with elevated mortality in hematological patients. Negative indirect effects are also evident within this setting.","Condom, Maria; Mussetti, Alberto; Maluquer, Clara; Parody, Rocío; González-Barca, Eva; Arnan, Montserrat; Albasanz-Puig, Adaia; Pomares, Helena; Salas, Maria Queralt; Carro, Itziar; Peña, Marta; Clapes, Victòria; Baca Cano, Cristina; Oliveira Ramos, Ana Carla; Sanz-Linares, Gabriela; Moreno-González, Gabriel; Mercadal, Santiago; Boqué, Concepcion; Gudiol, Carlota; Domingo-Domènech, Eva; Sureda, Anna",Cancer Rep (Hoboken),,650

275025,SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing human recombinant antibodies selected from pre-pandemic healthy donors binding at RBD-ACE2 interface,2021,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Nutritional predisposition to severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains unclear. Zinc deficiency could be critical since it is associated with a higher susceptibility to infections. We evaluated the prevalence of hypozincemia in the early stage of COVID-19, its association with risk factors for severe COVID-19 and its prognostic value for hospitalization for respiratory complications within 10 days. METHODS: For 152 COVID-19 patients and 88 non-COVID-19 patients admitted to COVID-19 screening centers, national early warning score for COVID-19 (NEWS) and laboratory analyses were performed to identify the risk for severe COVID-19. Multivariable logistic regression analysis assessed whether hypozincemia was an independent predictor of hospitalization for respiratory complications within 10 days (primary judgment criterion). The secondary judgment criteria were high NEWS score (&#8805;7), comorbidities and biomarkers associated with severe COVID-19. RESULTS: Hypozincemia was more frequent in COVID-19 patients compared to non-COVID-19 patients (27.6% vs 11.4%; p = 0.003). Older patients (&#8805;65 years) and medically assisted nursing home residents were at higher risk of hypozincemia (p < 0.01). Hypozincemia was associated with a worse NEWS score (p < 0.01) and lymphopenia (p < 0.001). Hypozincemia was independently associated with hospitalization for respiratory complications within 10 days (OR = 10.9, 95% CI = 2.3-51.6, p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: In the early stage of COVID-19, the prevalence of hypozincemia exceeded 20%. Hypozincemia was an independent predictor of hospitalization for respiratory complications within 10 days. This may suggest the importance of early detection and treatment of zinc deficiency in the nutritional management of COVID-19, especially in older people. Therefore, intervention and adjuvant treatment trials are strongly needed.","Fromonot, Julien; Gette, Mickael; Ben Lassoued, Amin; Guéant, Jean-Louis; Guéant-Rodriguez, Rosa-Maria; Guieu, Régis",Clin. nutr.

MAIN BODY: COVID-19 is a two-phase disease being marked by (phase 1) increased virus transmission and infection rates due to the wide expression of the main infection-related ACE2, TMPRSS2 and CTSB/L human genes in tissues of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract, as well as by (phase 2) host- and probably sex- and/or age-specific uncontrolled inflammatory immune responses which drive hyper-cytokinemia, aggressive inflammation and (due to broad organotropism of SARS-CoV-2) collateral tissue damage and systemic failure likely because of imbalanced ACE/ANGII/AT1R and ACE2/ANG(1-7)/MASR axes signaling. CONCLUSION: Here we discuss SARS-CoV-2 life cycle and a number of approaches aiming to suppress viral infection rates or propagation; increase virus antigen presentation in order to activate a robust and durable adaptive immune response from the host, and/or mitigate the ARDS-related ""cytokine storm"" and collateral tissue damage that triggers the severe life-threatening complications of COVID-19.","Trougakos, Ioannis P; Stamatelopoulos, Kimon; Terpos, Evangelos; Tsitsilonis, Ourania E; Aivalioti, Evmorfia; Paraskevis, Dimitrios; Kastritis, Efstathios; Pavlakis, George N; Dimopoulos, Meletios A",J Biomed Sci,,650
278276,Computational analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses based on the Kolmogorov's complexity and Shannon's information theories,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a respiratory viral infection with unique features including a more chronic course and systemic disease manifestations including multiple organ involvement; and there are differences in disease severity between ethnic groups. The immunological basis for disease has not been fully characterised. Analysis of whole-blood RNA expression may provide valuable information on disease pathogenesis. METHODS: We studied 45 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection within 10 days from onset of illness and a control group of 19 asymptomatic healthy volunteers with no known exposure to COVID-19 in the previous 14 days. Relevant demographic and clinical information was collected and a blood sample was drawn from all participants for whole-blood RNA sequencing. We evaluated differentially-expressed genes in COVID-19 patients (log2 fold change &#8805; 1 versus healthy controls; false-discovery rate < 0.05) and associated protein pathways and compared these to published whole-blood signatures for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza. We developed a disease score reflecting the overall magnitude of expression of internally-validated genes and assessed the relationship between the disease score and clinical disease parameters. RESULTS: We found 135 differentially-expressed genes in the patients with COVID-19 (median age 35 years; 82% male; 36% Chinese, 53% South Asian ethnicity). Of the 117 induced genes, 14 were found in datasets from RSV and 40 from influenza; 95 genes were unique to COVID-19. Protein pathways were mostly generic responses to viral infections, including apoptosis by P53-associated pathway, but also included some unique pathways such as viral carcinogenesis. There were no major qualitative differences in pathways between ethnic groups. The composite gene-expression score was correlated with the time from onset of symptoms and nasal swab qPCR CT values (both p < 0.01) but was not related to participant age, gender, ethnicity or the presence or absence of chest X-ray abnormalities (all p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The whole-blood transcriptome of COVID-19 has overall similarity with other respiratory infections but there are some unique pathways that merit further exploration to determine clinical relevance. The approach to a disease score may be of value, but needs further validation in a population with a greater range of disease severity.","Kwan, Philip Kam Weng; Cross, Gail B; Naftalin, Claire M; Ahidjo, Bintou A; Mok, Chee Keng; Fanusi, Felic; Permata Sari, Intan; Chia, Siok Ching; Kumar, Shoban Krishna; Alagha, Rawan; Tham, Sai Meng; Archuleta, Sophia; Sessions, October M; Hibberd, Martin L; Paton, Nicholas I",BMC Med Genomics,,650

Here we reviewed previous studies on natural derived nasal sprays and found that some known natural derived ingredients have antiviral properties, so their topical use as a nasal spray is effective in reducing the symptoms of respiratory infections, and it also has potential of decreasing viral load including titer of coronaviruses, in the nasal cavity. It seems that use of carrageenan or other herbal ingredients nasal spray may block the SARS-CoV-2 virus entering to the lung cells of a contaminated person and also can prevent virus transmission to other susceptible persons. Further, noticing what we know about novel 2019 coronavirus so far, we suggested carrageenan that has an unspecific physical antiviral activity and some other natural derived ingredients as a choice in coping with SARS-CoV-2 virus infection.","Hoseini-Tavassol, Zahra; Ejtahed, Hanieh-Sadat; Soroush, Ahmad-Reza; Sajjadpour, Zahra; Hasani-Ranjbar, Shirin; Larijani, Bagher",Infectious disorders.

In this perspective, retinoic acid (RA)-differentiated neuroblastoma cell lines, SH-SY5Y and SK-N-BE(2) and glioblastoma cell lines, U-87 MG and U-373 MG, were infected with a SARS-CoV-2 strain, at various multiplicity-of-infection (MOI). We first demonstrated that the common entry genes - needed for invading epithelial cells - were expressed. RA-differentiation induced an upregulation of ace2 and tmprss2 gene expression while inducing downregulation of ctsb and ctsl. Using in situ hybridization and confocal analysis, SARS-CoV-2 gene S RNA was detected intracellularly at MOI 5.0, and localized in both soma and neuritic-like or glial-like processes. The infection was confirmed by quantification of viral gene E RNA and showed a dose-dependency, with few infected cells at MOI 0.1. After 24 h of infection, no cytopathic effect was observed in SH-SY5Y abilities to maintain neuritic processes or in U-373 MG for the uptake of glutamate. Unlike the permissive Vero E6 cells, no significant apoptosis death was detected following SARS-CoV-2 infection of neuroblastoma or glioblastoma cells. This study demonstrates the susceptibility of neuronal- and glial-like cell lines towards SARS-CoV-2 infection at high MOIs. Once inside the cells, the virus does not seem to rapidly replicate nor exert major cytopathic effect. Overall, our results strengthen the idea that SARS-CoV-2 has a tropism for nervous cells that express commonly described entry genes.","Bielarz, Valéry; Willemart, Kévin; Avalosse, Noémie; De Swert, Kathleen; Lotfi, Riselane; Lejeune, Noémie; Poulain, Florian; Ninanne, Noelle; Gilloteaux, Jacques; Gillet, Nicolas; Nicaise, Charles",Brain Res,,650

Role of Protein and Inhibitor Conformational Changes in the Reaction Mechanism,2021,"Managing healthcare demand and capacity is especially difficult in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, where limited intensive care resources can be overwhelmed by a large number of cases requiring admission in a short space of time. If patients are unable to access this specialist resource, then death is a likely outcome. In appreciating these 'capacity-dependent' deaths, this paper reports on the clinically-led development of a stochastic discrete event simulation model designed to capture the key dynamics of the intensive care admissions process for COVID-19 patients. With application to a large public hospital in England during an early stage of the pandemic, the purpose of this study was to estimate the extent to which such capacity-dependent deaths can be mitigated through demand-side initiatives involving non-pharmaceutical interventions and supply-side measures to increase surge capacity. Based on information available at the time, results suggest that total capacity-dependent deaths can be reduced by 75% through a combination of increasing capacity from 45 to 100 beds, reducing length of stay by 25%, and flattening the peak demand to 26 admissions per day. Accounting for the additional 'capacity-independent' deaths, which occur even when appropriate care is available within the intensive care setting, yields an aggregate reduction in total deaths of 30%. The modelling tool, which is freely available and open source, has since been used to support COVID-19 response planning at a number of healthcare systems within the UK National Health Service.","Wood, Richard M; McWilliams, Christopher J; Thomas, Matthew J; Bourdeaux, Christopher P; Vasilakis, Christos",Health Care Manag Sci,,650

South Korea experienced a surge of COVID-19 cases on February 19 2020, but was able to flatten the COVID-19 curve in only 20 days without enforcing lockdown measures that restrict the freedom and movement of people. To analyze how South Korea achieved as such, this study is based on the actual field experience of the Korean government's COVID-19 response team who participated in drafting the 'Tacking COVID-19: Korean experience' and in-depth analysis on past South Korean government experience from the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome of 2015. This paper finds three prominent factors behind Korea's responses against COVID-19. First, it is crucial that the government responds as 'one team' efficiently to cooperate and respond to COVID-19. Second, a novel approach is needed to combat the spread of the novel coronavirus. Information and communication technology (ICT) had a key role in South Korea's strategy to contain COVID-19. Third, an effective response to COVID-19 was possible due to the successful partnership between the general public and state authorities.","Lee, Daejoong; Heo, Kyungmoo; Seo, Yongseok; Ahn, Hyerim; Jung, Kyungran; Lee, Sohyun; Choi, Hyeseung",Am. j. epidemiol,,650

In this current worldwide emergency, the clinical business is searching for new advancements to screen and combat COVID-19 contamination. Strategies used by artificial intelligence can stretch screen the spread of the infection, distinguish highly infected patients, and be compelling in supervising the illness continuously. The artificial intelligence anticipation can further be used for passing dangers by sufficiently dissecting information from past sufferers. International patient support with recommendations for population testing, medical care, notification, and infection control can help fight this deadly virus. We proposed the hybrid deep learning method to diagnose COVID-19. The layered approach is used here to measure the symptom level of the patients and to analyze the patient image data whether he/she is positive with COVID-19. This work utilizes smart AI techniques to predict and diagnose the coronavirus rapidly by the Oura smart ring within 24 h. In the laboratory, a coronavirus rapid test is prepared with the help of a deep learning model using the RNN and CNN algorithms to diagnose the coronavirus rapidly and accurately. The result shows the value 0 or 1. The result 1 indicates the person is affected with coronavirus and the result 0 indicates the person is not affected with coronavirus. X-Ray and CT image classifications are considered here so that the threshold value is utilized for identifying an individual's health condition from the initial stage to a severe stage.

296159,Rapid SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequencing and analysis for informed public health decision-making in the Netherlands,2020,"COVID-19 due to the SARS-CoV-2 infection is a multi-systemic immune syndrome affecting mainly the lungs, oropharyngeal region, and other vascular endothelial beds. There are tremendous ongoing efforts for the aim of developing drugs against the COVID-19 syndrome-associated inflammation. However, currently no specific medicine is present for the absolute pharmacological cure of COVID-19 mucositis. The re-purposing/re-positioning of already existing drugs is a very important strategy for the management of ongoing pandemy since the development of a new drug needs decades. Apart from altering angiotensin signaling pathways, novel drug candidates for re-purposing comprise medications shall target COVID-19 pathobiology, including pharmaceutical formulations that antagonize proteinase-activated receptors (PARs), mainly PAR-1. Activation of the PAR-1, mediators and hormones impact on the hemostasis, endothelial activation, alveolar epithelial cells and mucosal inflammatory responses which are the essentials of the COVID-19 pathophysiology. In this context, Ankaferd hemostat (Ankaferd Blood Stopper, ABS) which is an already approved hemostatic agent affecting via vital erythroid aggregation and fibrinogen gamma could be a potential topical remedy for the mucosal management of COVID-19. ABS is a clinically safe and effective topical hemostatic agent of plant origin capable of exerting pleiotropic effects on the endothelial cells, angiogenesis, cell proliferation and vascular dynamics. ABS had been approved as a topically applied hemostatic agent for the management of post-surgical/dental bleedings and healing of infected inflammatory mucosal wounds. The anti-inflammatory and proteinase-activated receptor axis properties of ABS with a considerable amount of oestrogenic hormone presence highlight this unique topical hemostatic drug regarding the clinical re-positioning for COVID-19-associated mucositis. Topical ABS as a biological response modifier may lessen SARS-CoV-2 associated microthrombosis, endothelial dysfunction, oropharyngeal inflammation and mucosal lung damage. Moreover, PAR-1 inhibition ability of ABS might be helpful for reducing the initial virus propagation and mocasal spread of COVID-19.","Beyazit, Fatma; Beyazit, Yavuz; Tanoglu, Alpaslan; Haznedaroglu, Ibrahim C",Med Hypotheses,,650

A chemical characterization of volatile compounds of mango peel and seed were performed in comparison with mango pulp by HS-SPME/GC-MS. RESULTS: More than 60 volatile compounds were detected in mango by-products whose aromatic activity was estimated by means of odorant activity values (OAVs). Results pointed out mango peel as a valuable matrix on odor-active compounds which were found even in larger quantities than in edible mango fraction. 3-Carene was the predominant compound although other compounds such as decanal, 1-octen-3-one, nonanal, limonene, ß-damascenone and 2-nonenal were the most odor-active compounds in mango peel. The greatest aromatic impact with sensorial features described as fresh/herbaceous, fruity, floral and resinous was found in peel mango. CONCLUSION: The exceptional flavoring potential of mango peel by-product opens a door for its use and revalorization as natural flavoring ingredient in food and cosmetic industries.

Objective: our study aimed to identify negative impacts of COVID-19 on occupations of Vietnamese people during the first national lockdown, including the quality and quantity of jobs as well as adverse problems at work due to COVID-19. Methods: A cross-sectional study using web-based platforms was conducted during the first time of social isolation in Vietnam at the beginning of April 2020. We utilized a respondent-driven sampling technique to select 1423 respondents from 63 cities and provinces over Vietnam. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was used to define sub-domains of perceived impacts of COVID-19 on occupations. Findings: Approximately two-thirds of respondents reported decreases in their income (61.6%), and 28.2% reported that their income deficit was 40% and above. The percentage of female individuals having decreased revenue due to COVID-19 was higher than that of male respondents (65.2% and 54.7%, respectively).

This leads to frequent pulmonary and cerebral thromboembolism as well as occasional involvement of other organs. We present a 71-year-old man who initially presented with 2 weeks of fever, cough, and shortness of breath and was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia. He required readmission due to worsened hypoxia and was later found to have left renal artery thrombosis with left kidney infarction, associated with an ascending aortic thrombus.

Obese children are likely to become obese adults, and adult obesity is associated with an increased risk of morbidity. Therefore, controlling the childhood obesity epidemic has become a top public health priority worldwide. The current COVID-19 pandemic may significantly impede this important mission and constitute an unprecedented tragedy in the global battle against childhood obesity. This manuscript presents evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic will aggravate the childhood obesity epidemic and lead to significant weight gain in school children by creating an unprecedented obesogenic environment. Within the last few months, many countries took uncompromising measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including school closures and quarantine. While these steps are often necessary to ensure infection control, they may have a significant negative effect on children's mental and physical health. Physical, nutritional, and psychosocial factors that promote obesity in children during this special situation complementarily contribute to an unprecedented obesogenic environment. Large-scale quarantine and home confinement will impose new and unfamiliar stressors on children, thereby worsening the childhood obesity epidemic. Most importantly, adverse childhood events resulting from a predicted increase in domestic violence within the next few months will significantly contribute to this concern. The scenario presented in this review is of paramount public health importance and must be considered during future pandemic planning. Involved stakeholders, including governments, schools, and families, must make all possible efforts to minimize the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on childhood obesity.","Storz, Maximilian Andreas",,,650

CONCLUSIONS: Appropriate clinical suspicion is necessary for both acute disease and MIS-C. SARS-CoV-2 serologic tests obtained early in the diagnostic process may help to narrow down the differential but does not distinguish between acute COVID-19 and MIS-C.

We have previously described a clinician scoring system that delineates whether a patient's prognosis is driven by acute illness vs comorbidities. In this study we compared this clinician phenotyping system in patients with COVID-19 to ICU biobank patients enrolled prior to 2020. Methods: Clinician phenotyping was performed on patients enrolled into 2 Stanford ICU biobanks: (1) Patients admitted to Stanford ICU before 2020 with at least one ARDS risk factor (non-COVID-19 cohort) and (2) Patients admitted to the ICU with confirmed COVID-19 infection (COVID-19 cohort). The roles of each of the following categories in determining prognosis at time of enrollment were scored from 1-5 (1 being non-contributory and 5 being highly contributory): goals of care, comorbidities, baseline functional status, acute multi-system organ failure (MSOF), ARDS, acute neurologic injury, and terminal illness. Each patient's primary determinant of mortality was then grouped into one of four categories: (1) MSOF or ARDS (&gt;=4 for ARDS or multi-organ failure), (2) Comorbidities (&gt;=4 for goals of care, comorbidities, acute neurologic injury, or baseline functional status), (3) Mixed (&gt;= 4 for both of the above), or (4) None (&lt;4 for all categories). The odds ratio for prognostic subgroupings was compared between patient cohorts.Results: Clinician phenotyping was performed on 70 non-COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU with at least one risk factor for ARDS, and 28 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU. Compared to the general ICU population, COVID-19 patients were younger (median age 53 vs 71), more likely to be male (71% vs 54%), and more likely to identify as Hispanic (64% vs 13%). 60-day mortality was higher in the COVID-19 group (29% vs 20%). ARDS or MSOF was the primary determinant of prognosis in 64% of patients with COVID-19 compared to 31% of traditional ICU patients (OR 3.9, 95% CI 1.6-9.9, Figure 1). Only 11% of COVID-19 patients' primary determinant of prognosis was comorbidities or goals of care relative to 31% in the traditional ICU population (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.07-0.9).Conclusion: In this study, ARDS or MSOF is far more likely to be the main risk factor for death in patients with COVID-19 than in a traditional ICU population. This suggests that most COVID-19 fatalities are attributable to acute infection with SARS-CoV-2 rather than progression of underlying disease.","Moore, A. R.; Pienkos, S.; Nadeau, K.

309584,Coding-complete genome sequences of two SARS-CoV-2 isolates from Egypt,2020,"Androgen Receptor (AR) signaling is a critical driver of hormone-dependent prostate cancer and has also been proposed to have biological activity in female hormone-dependent cancers, including type I endometrial carcinoma (EMC). In this study, we evaluated the preclinical efficacy of a third-generation AR antagonist, enzalutamide, in a genetic mouse model of EMC, Sprr2f-Cre;Ptenfl/fl. In this model, ablation of Pten in the uterine epithelium leads to localized and distant malignant disease as observed in human EMC. We hypothesized that administering enzalutamide through the diet would temporarily decrease the incidence of invasive and metastatic carcinoma, while prolonged administration would result in development of resistance and loss of efficacy. Short-term treatment with enzalutamide reduced overall tumor burden through increased apoptosis but failed to prevent progression of invasive and metastatic disease. These results suggest that AR signaling may have biphasic, oncogenic and tumor suppressive roles in EMC that are dependent on disease stage. Enzalutamide treatment increased Progesterone Receptor (PR) expression within both stromal and tumor cell compartments. Prolonged administration of enzalutamide decreased apoptosis, increased tumor burden and resulted in the clonal expansion of tumor cells expressing high levels of p53 protein, suggestive of acquired Trp53 mutations. In conclusion, we show that enzalutamide induces apoptosis in EMC but has limited efficacy overall as a single agent. Induction of PR, a negative regulator of endometrial proliferation, suggests that adding progestin therapy to enzalutamide administration may further decrease tumor burden and result in a prolonged response.","Koivisto, Christopher S; Parrish, Melodie; Bonala, Santosh B; Ngoi, Soo; Torres, Adrian; Gallagher, James; Sanchez-Hodge, Rebekah; Zeinner, Victor; Nahhas, Georges J; Liu, Bei; Cohn, David E; Backes, Floor J; Goodfellow, Paul J; Chamberlin, Helen M; Leone, Gustavo",Neoplasia,,650

313592,A Genomic Perspective on the Origin and Emergence of SARS-CoV-2,2020,"The origins of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive antibodies and their potential impacts on vaccine efficacy have not been fully clarified. In this study, we demonstrated that S2 was the prevailing target of the pre-existing S protein cross-reactive antibodies in both healthy human and SPF mice. A dominant antibody epitope was identified on the connector domain of S2 (1147-SFKEELDKYFKNHT-1160, P144), which could be recognized by pre-existing antibodies in both human and mouse. Through metagenomic sequencing and fecal bacteria transplant, we proved that the generation of S2 cross-reactive antibodies was associated with commensal gut bacteria. Furthermore, six P144 specific monoclonal antibodies were isolated from mouse and proved to cross-react with commensal gut bacteria collected from both human and mouse. Mice with high levels of pre-existing S2 cross-reactive antibodies mounted higher S protein specific binding antibodies, especially against S2, after being immunized with a candidate COVID-19 DNA vaccine. Similarly, we found that levels of pre-existing antibodies against both S2 and P144 correlated positively with RBD specific binding antibody titers after two doses of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in human. Taken together, our findings revealed that the pre-existing cross-reactive antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein could be induced by commensal gut bacteria and suggested that these pre-existing cross-reactive antibodies could facilitate the induction of S protein specific antibody responses after vaccination.","Jia, Liqiu; Weng, Shufeng; Wu, Jing; Tian, Xiangxiang; Zhang, Yifan; Wang, Xuyang; Wang, Jing; Yan, Dongmei; Wang, Wanhai; Zhu, Zhaoqin; Qiu, Chao; Zhang, Wenhong; Xu, Ying; Wan, Yanmin",,,650

Evaluating this preparedness requires an assessment of the full clinical system, from intake to isolation. INITIAL ASSESSMENT: Unannounced Standardized Patients (USPs) present a nimble, sensitive methodology for assessing this readiness. CHOICE OF SOLUTION: Pilot the Unannounced Standardized Patient methodology, which employs an actor trained to present as a standardized, incognito potentially infected patient, to assess clinical readiness for potential COVID-19 patients at an urban, community safety-net clinic. IMPLEMENTATION: The Unannounced Standardized Patient was trained to present at each team's front desk with the complaint of feeling unwell (reporting a fever of 101 degrees Fahrenheit in the past 24 hours) and exposure to a roommate recently returned from Beijing. The Unannounced Standardized Patient was trained to complete a behaviorally-anchored assessment of the care she received from the clinical system. EVALUATION: There was clear variation in care Unannounced Standardized Patients received; some frontline clerical staff followed best practices; others did not. Signage and information on disease spread prevention publicly available was inconsistent. Qualitative comments shared by the Unannounced Standardized Patients and those gathered during group debrief reinforced the experiences of the Unannounced Standardized Patients and hospital leadership. LESSONS LEARNED: Unannounced Standardized Patients revealed significant variation in care practices within a clinical system. Utilization of this assessment methodology can provide just-in-time clinical information about readiness and safety practices, particularly during emerging outbreaks. Unannounced Standardized Patients will prove especially powerful as clinicians and systems return to outpatient visits while remaining vigilant about potentially infected individuals.","Fisher, Harriet; Re, Cherilyn; Wilhite, Jeffery A; Hanley, Kathleen; Altshuler, Lisa; Schmidtberger, James; Gagliardi, Morris; Zabar, Sondra",Int. j. qual. health care,,650

319071,The sound of host-SARS-CoV-2 molecular interactions,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Genotyping of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been instrumental in monitoring viral evolution and transmission during the pandemic. The quality of the sequence data obtained from these genotyping efforts depends on several factors, including the quantity/integrity of the input material, the technology, and laboratory-specific implementation. The current lack of guidelines for SARS-CoV-2 genotyping leads to inclusion of error-containing genome sequences in genomic epidemiology studies. We aimed to establish clear and broadly applicable recommendations for reliable virus genotyping. METHODS: We established and used a sequencing data analysis workflow that reliably identifies and removes technical artefacts;such artefacts can result in miscalls when using alternative pipelines to process clinical samples and synthetic viral genomes with an amplicon-based genotyping approach. We evaluated the impact of experimental factors, including viral load and sequencing depth, on correct sequence determination. RESULTS: We found that at least 1000 viral genomes are necessary to confidently detect variants in the SARS-CoV-2 genome at frequencies of &gt;=10%. The broad applicability of our recommendations was validated in over 200 clinical samples from six independent laboratories. The genotypes we determined for clinical isolates with sufficient quality cluster by sampling location and period. Our analysis also supports the rise in frequencies of 20A.EU1 and 20A.EU2, two recently reported European strains whose dissemination was facilitated by travel during the summer of 2020. CONCLUSIONS: We present much-needed recommendations for the reliable determination of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences and demonstrate their broad applicability in a large cohort of clinical samples.","Kubik, S.; Marques, A.

319643,Deep Transfer Learning Approach for Automatic Recognition of Drug Toxicity and Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2,2021,"BACKGROUND: In 2020, the number of internet users surpassed 4.6 billion. Individuals who create and share digital data can leave a trail of information about their habits and preferences that collectively generate a digital footprint. Studies have shown that digital footprints can reveal important information regarding an individual's health status, ranging from diet and exercise to depression. Uses of digital applications have accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic where public health organizations have utilized technology to reduce the burden of transmission, ultimately leading to policy discussions about digital health privacy. Though US consumers report feeling concerned about the way their personal data is used, they continue to use digital technologies. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to understand the extent to which consumers recognize possible health applications of their digital data and identify their most salient concerns around digital health privacy. METHODS: We conducted semistructured interviews with a diverse national sample of US adults from November 2018 to January 2019. Participants were recruited from the Ipsos KnowledgePanel, a nationally representative panel. Participants were asked to reflect on their own use of digital technology, rate various sources of digital information, and consider several hypothetical scenarios with varying sources and health-related applications of personal digital information. RESULTS: The final cohort included a diverse national sample of 45 US consumers. Participants were generally unaware what consumer digital data might reveal about their health. They also revealed limited knowledge of current data collection and aggregation practices. When responding to specific scenarios with health-related applications of data, they had difficulty weighing the benefits and harms but expressed a desire for privacy protection. They saw benefits in using digital data to improve health, but wanted limits to health programs' use of consumer digital data. CONCLUSIONS: Current privacy restrictions on health-related data are premised on the notion that these data are derived only from medical encounters. Given that an increasing amount of health-related data is derived from digital footprints in consumer settings, our findings suggest the need for greater transparency of data collection and uses, and broader health privacy protections.","Grande, David; Luna Marti, Xochitl; Merchant, Raina M; Asch, David A; Dolan, Abby; Sharma, Meghana; Cannuscio, Carolyn C",J Med Internet Res,,650

Chemokines are a family of cytokines which are chemotactic in nature and cause the recruitment of cells of inflammation. Periodontitis has long been attributed to having its pathophysiology rooted in a cytokine response. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has been reported to have adverse outcomes related to the establishment of a cytokine storm, many of the components of which are common with the cytokine expression profile of periodontitis. This communication explores the connection between COVID-19 and periodontal disease through their cytokine connection to form a translational basis for recommending maintenance of oral hygiene in the COVID era and to red flag patients with periodontitis as having an increased risk of exhibiting COVID related adverse outcomes.","Sahni, Vaibhav; Gupta, Shipra",Med Hypotheses,,650
320084,Mechanistic Insights to the Binding of Antibody CR3022 Against RBD from SARS-CoV and HCoV-19/SARS-CoV-2: A Computational Study,2020,"Academic librarianship is a heavily feminized profession, with women making up between 72 and 74% of the workforce based on statistics from Canada and the US (American Library Association, 2012;Canadian Association of University Teachers, 2017). As a result, gendered issues such as salary discrepancies and a glass ceiling phenomenon might be expected to be magnified in such an environment. The authors analyzed linked data from a 2018 census of academic librarians to uncover and examine the experience of motherhood and librarianship, specifically by looking at potential connections between gender, salary, number of dependents, and academic rank. Results demonstrate that women earn, on average, $10,000CDN/year less, are less likely to become a parent as their career progresses, and are overly represented at the lower ranks (e.g., Assistant Librarian) than their men counterparts. Drawing upon the literature on motherhood, salary differences, and career progression in academia, we demonstrate that issues long standing in the profession have yet to be resolved.","Eva, Nicole Lê Mê-Linh Sheriff John",The Journal of Academic Librarianship,,650

These vaccines displayed clinical efficacy in initial studies against confirmed COVID-19 of 95.0%, 94.1%, and 66.9%, respectively. MethodsIndividuals receiving one of these vaccines were invited to participate in a prospective longitudinal comparative study of immune responses elicited by the three vaccines. In this observational cohort study, humoral responses were evaluated using a SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) ELISA and a SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralization assay at mean of 21-31 days and 45-63 days following each initial vaccination. IFN-{gamma} ELISPOT assays were conducted with peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained at a median of 45-63 days after each initial vaccination. ResultsThe two mRNA-based platforms elicited similar RBD ELISA responses and neutralizing antibody responses. The adenovirus-based vaccine elicited significantly lower RBD ELISA and SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralization activity. The mRNA-1273 vaccine elicited significantly higher spike glycoprotein-specific T cell responses than either the BNT162b2 or the Ad26.COV2.S vaccines. ConclusionsBoth mRNA based vaccines elicited higher magnitude humoral responses than Ad26.COV2.S and mRNA1273 elicited the highest magnitude of T cell response. Neutralizing antibody titers correlated with reported estimates of vaccine efficacy. Summary of key pointsWe compared antigen specific humoral and T cell responses following vaccination with BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, or Ad26.COV2.S. Both mRNA based vaccines elicited higher magnitude humoral responses than Ad26.COV2.S and mRNA1273 elicited the highest magnitude of T cell response.","Barbeau, Dominique; Martin, Judith; Carney, Emily; Dougherty, Emily; Doyle, Joshua; Dermody, Terence; Hoberman, Alejandro; Williams, John; Michaels, Marian; Alcorn, John; Duprex, Paul; McElroy, Anita K",,,650

This new positive-sense single-stranded RNA strain of coronavirus spreads through droplets of saliva and nasal discharge. PURPOSE: US FDA has authorized the emergency use of Remdesivir looking at the increasing number of cases of COVID-19, however there is still no drug approved to treat COVID-19. An alternative way of treatment could be the use of naturally derived molecules with known antiviral properties. METHOD: We reviewed the antiviral activities of two polyphenols derived from tea, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) from green tea and theaflavins from black tea. Both green tea and black tea polyphenols have been reported to exhibit antiviral activities against various viruses, especially positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses. RESULTS: Recent studies have revealed the possible binding sites present on SARS-CoV-2 and studied their interactions with tea polyphenols. EGCG and theaflavins, especially theaflavin-3,3'-digallate (TF3) have shown a significant interaction with the receptors under consideration in this review. Some docking studies further emphasize on the activity of these polyphenols against COVID-19.

322169,Isolating SARS-CoV-2 Strains From Countries in the Same Meridian: Genome Evolutionary Analysis,2021,"In this paper, we prove functional central limit theorems (FCLTs) for a stochastic epidemic model with varying infectivity and general infectious periods recently introduced in Forien, Pang and Pardoux (2020). The infectivity process (total force of infection at each time) is composed of the independent infectivity random functions of each infectious individual at the elapsed time (that is, infection-age dependent). These infectivity random functions induce the infectious periods (as well as exposed, recovered or immune periods in full generality), whose probability distributions can be very general. The epidemic model includes the generalized non--Markovian SIR, SEIR, SIS, SIRS models with infection-age dependent infectivity. In the FCLT for the generalized SEIR model (including SIR as a special case), the limits for the infectivity and susceptible processes are a unique solution to a two-dimensional Gaussian-driven stochastic Volterra integral equations, and then given these solutions, the limits for the exposed/latent, infected and recovered processes are Gaussian processes expressed in terms of the solutions to those stochastic Volterra integral equations.

However, the association between frailty and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) prognosis remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association between frailty and mortality over 6 months in middle-aged and older patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and the association between acute morbidity severity and mortality across frailty strata. DESIGN: Observational cohort study. SETTING: Large academic medical center in Brazil. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1830 patients aged &#8805;50 years hospitalized with COVID-19 (March-July 2020). MEASUREMENTS: We screened baseline frailty using the CFS (1-9) and classified patients as fit to managing well (1-3), vulnerable (4), mildly (5), moderately (6), or severely frail to terminally ill (7-9). We also computed a frailty index (0-1; frail >0.25), a well-known frailty measure. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the association between frailty and time to death within 30 days and 6 months of admission. We also examined whether frailty identified different mortality risk levels within strata of similar age and acute morbidity as measured by the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. RESULTS: Median age was 66 years, 58% were male, and 27% were frail to some degree. Compared with fit-to-managing-well patients, the adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence interval [CI]) for 30-day and 6-month mortality were, respectively, 1.4 (1.1-1.7) and 1.4 (1.1-1.7) for vulnerable patients; 1.5 (1.1-1.9) and 1.5 (1.1-1.8) for mild frailty; 1.8 (1.4-2.3) and 1.9 (1.5-2.4) for moderate frailty; and 2.1 (1.6-2.7) and 2.3 (1.8-2.9) for severe frailty to terminally ill. The CFS achieved outstanding accuracy to identify frailty compared with the Frailty Index (area under the curve = 0.94; 95% CI = 0.93-0.95) and predicted different mortality risks within age and acute morbidity groups.

To date, several peptides have been proposed against SARS-CoV-2 both as inhibitor agents or as detection tools that can also be attached to the surfaces of nanoparticle carriers. But owing to their natural amino acid sequences, such peptides cannot be considered as efficient therapeutic candidates from a biostability point of view.

324507,"Neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2: current understanding, challenge and perspective",2020,"OBJECTIVE: To study whether combining vital signs and electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis can improve early prognostication. METHODS: This study analyzed 1258 adults with coronavirus disease 2019 who were seen at three hospitals in New York in March and April 2020. Electrocardiograms at presentation to the emergency department were systematically read by electrophysiologists. The primary outcome was a composite of mechanical ventilation or death 48 hours from diagnosis. The prognostic value of ECG abnormalities was assessed in a model adjusted for demographics, comorbidities, and vital signs. RESULTS: At 48 hours, 73 of 1258 patients (5.8%) had died and 174 of 1258 (13.8%) were alive but receiving mechanical ventilation with 277 of 1258 (22.0%) patients dying by 30 days. Early development of respiratory failure was common, with 53% of all intubations occurring within 48 hours of presentation. In a multivariable logistic regression, atrial fibrillation/flutter (odds ratio [OR], 2.5; 95% CI, 1.1 to 6.2), right ventricular strain (OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.3 to 6.1), and ST segment abnormalities (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.5 to 3.8) were associated with death or mechanical ventilation at 48 hours. In 108 patients without these ECG abnormalities and with normal respiratory vitals (rate <20 breaths/min and saturation >95%), only 5 (4.6%) died or required mechanical ventilation by 48 hours versus 68 of 216 patients (31.5%) having both ECG and respiratory vital sign abnormalities. CONCLUSION: The combination of abnormal respiratory vital signs and ECG findings of atrial fibrillation/flutter, right ventricular strain, or ST segment abnormalities accurately prognosticates early deterioration in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 and may assist with patient triage.","Elias, Pierre; Poterucha, Timothy J; Jain, Sneha S; Sayer, Gabriel; Raikhelkar, Jayant; Fried, Justin; Clerkin, Kevin; Griffin, Jan; DeFilippis, Ersilia M; Gupta, Aakriti; Lawlor, Matthew; Madhavan, Mahesh; Rosenblum, Hannah; Roth, Zachary B; Natarajan, Karthik; Hripcsak, George; Perotte, Adler; Wan, Elaine Y; Saluja, Amardeep; Dizon, Jose; Ehlert, Frederick; Morrow, John P; Yarmohammadi, Hirad; Kumaraiah, Deepa; Redfors, Bjorn; Gavin, Nicholas; Kirtane, Ajay; Rabbani, Leroy; Burkhoff, Dan; Moses, Jeffrey; Schwartz, Allan; Leon, Martin; Uriel, Nir",Mayo Clin Proc,,650

As a vaccination effort, the study provided an empirical evidence on willingness to vaccinate by sociodemographic, clinical and regional differences in Bangladeshi adults. METHODS: This cross-sectional analysis from a household survey of 3646 adults aged 18 years or older was conducted in 8 districts of Bangladesh, from December 12, 2020, to January 7, 2021. Multinomial regression examined the impact of socio-demographic, clinical and healthcare-releated factors on hesitancy and reluctance of vaccination for COVID-19. RESULTS: Of the 3646 respondents (2212 men [60.7%]; mean [sd] age, 37.4 [13.9] years), 74.6% reported their willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19 when a safe and effective vaccine is available without a fee, while 8.5% were reluctant to vaccinate. With a minimum fee, 46.5% of the respondents showed intent to vaccinate. Among the respondents, 16.8% reported adequate adherence to health safety regulations, and 35.5% reported high confidence in the country's healthcare system. The COVID-19 vaccine refusal was significantly high in elderly, rural, semi-urban, and slum communities, farmers, day-laborers, homemakers, low-educated group, and those who had low confidence in the country's healthcare system. Also, the prevalence of vaccine hesitancy was high in the elderly population, low-educated group, day-laborers, people with chronic diseases, and people with low confidence in the country's healthcare system. CONCLUSION: A high prevalence of vaccine refusal and hesitancy was observed in rural people and slum dwellers in Bangladesh. The rural community and slum dwellers had a low literacy level, low adherence to health safety regulations and low confidence in healthcare system. The ongoing app-based registration for vaccination increased hesitancy and reluctancy in low-educated group. For rural, semi-urban, and slum people, outreach centers for vaccination can be established to ensure the vaccine's nearby availability and limit associated travel costs. In rural areas, community health workers, valued community-leaders, and non-governmental organizations can be utilized to motivate and educate people for vaccination against COVID-19. Further, emphasis should be given to the elderly and diseased people with tailored health messages and assurance from healthcare professionals. The media may play a responsible role with the vaccine education program and eliminate the social stigma about the vaccination. Finally, vaccination should be continued without a fee and thus Bangladesh's COVID vaccination program can become a model for other low and middle-income countries.","Abedin, Minhazul; Islam, Mohammad Aminul; Rahman, Farah Naz; Reza, Hasan Mahmud; Hossain, Mohammad Zakir; Hossain, Mohammad Anwar; Arefin, Adittya; Hossain, Ahmed",PLoS One,,650

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to summarize available data on severity differences in acute cardiac injury and acute cardiac injury with mortality during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search across Pubmed, Embase and pre-print from December 1, 2019 to March 27, 2020, to identify all observational studies that reported cardiac specific biomarkers (troponin, creatine kinase-MB fraction, myoglobin, or NT-proBNP) during COVID-19 infection. We extracted data on patient demographics, infection severity, comorbidity history, and biomarkers during COVID-19 infection. Where possible, data were pooled for meta-analysis with standard (SMD) or weighted (WMD) mean difference and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: We included 4189 confirmed COVID-19 infected patients from 28 studies. More severe COVID-19 infection is associated with higher mean troponin (SMD 0.53, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.75, p < 0.001), with a similar trend for creatine kinase-MB, myoglobin, and NT-proBNP. Acute cardiac injury was more frequent in those with severe, compared to milder, disease (risk ratio 5.99, 3.04 to 11.80; p < 0.001). Meta regression suggested that cardiac injury biomarker differences of severity are related to history of hypertension (p = 0.030). Also COVID19-related cardiac injury is associated with higher mortality (summary risk ratio 3.85, 2.13 to 6.96; p < 0.001). hsTnI and NT-proBNP levels increased during the course of hospitalization only in non-survivors. CONCLUSION: The severity of COVID-19 is associated with acute cardiac injury, and acute cardiac injury is associated with death. Cardiac injury biomarkers mainly increase in non-survivors. This highlights the need to effectively monitor heart health to prevent myocarditis in patients infected with COVID-19.","Li, Jing-Wei; Han, Tian-Wen; Woodward, Mark; Anderson, Craig S; Zhou, Hao; Chen, Yun-Dai; Neal, Bruce",Prog Cardiovasc Dis,,650

To decrease the risk of complications in such patients, one proposed solution has been to have those diagnosed with COVID-19 but not sick enough to warrant admission monitor their arterial oxygenation by pulse oximetry at home and present for care when they show evidence of hypoxemia. While the ease of use and low cost of pulse oximetry makes this an attractive option for identifying problems at an early stage, there are important considerations with pulse oximetry about which patients and providers may not be aware that can interfere with successful implementation of such monitoring programs. Only a few independent studies have examined the performance of pocket oximeters and smart phone-based systems but the limited available data raise questions about their accuracy, particularly as saturation falls below 90%. There are also multiple sources of error in pulse oximetry that must be accounted for including rapid fluctuations in measurements when the PaO2 falls on the steep portion of the dissociation curve, data acquisition problems when pulsatile blood flow is diminished, accuracy in the setting of severe hypoxemia, dyshemoglobinemias and other problems. Recognition of these issues and careful counseling of patients about the proper means for measuring their oxygen saturation and when to seek assistance can help ensure successful implementation of needed monitoring programs.","Luks, Andrew M; Swenson, Erik R",Ann.

Human-to-human transmission, as well as asymptomatic transmission of the infection, have been confirmed. As of April 03, 2020, public health crisis in China due to COVID-19 was potentially under control. We compiled a daily dataset of case counts, mortality, recovery, temperature, population density, and demographic information for each prefecture during the period of January 11 to April 07, 2020. Understanding the characteristics of spatial clustering of the COVID-19 epidemic and R0 is critical in effectively preventing and controlling the ongoing global pandemic. Considering this, the prefectures were grouped based on several relevant features using unsupervised machine learning techniques. Subsequently, we performed a computational analysis utilizing the reported cases in China to estimate the revised R0 among different regions. Finally, our overall research indicates that the impact of temperature and demographic factors on virus transmission may be characterized using a stochastic transmission model. Such predictions will help in prevention planning in an ongoing global pandemic, prioritizing segments of a given community/region for action and providing a visual aid in designing prevention strategies for a specific geographic region. Furthermore, revised estimation and our methodology will aid in improving the human health consequences of COVID-19 elsewhere.","Khan, Irtesam Mahmud; Haque, Ubydul; Zhang, Wenyi; Zafar, Sumaira; Wang, Yong; He, Junyu; Sun, Hailong; Lubinda, Jailos; Rahman, M Sohel",Acta Trop,,650

This requires a nasopharyngeal swab performed by a trained healthcare worker, which puts strain on saturated healthcare services. In this manuscript we describe a new approach for non-invasive COVID-19 diagnosis. It consists of using mobile biosensors for detecting viral antigens trapped in surgical face masks worn by patients. The biosensors are made of filter paper containing a nanoparticle reservoir. The nanoparticles transfer from the biosensor to the mask on contact, where they generate colorimetric signals that are quantified with a smartphone app. Sample collection requires wearing a surgical mask for 30 minutes, and the total assay time is shorter than 10 min. When tested in a cohort of 27 patients with mild or no symptoms, an area under the receiving operating curve (AUROC) of 0.99 was obtained (96.2% sensitivity and 100% specificity). Serial measurements revealed a high sensitivity and specificity when masks were worn up to 6 days after diagnosis. Surgical face masks are inexpensive and widely available, which makes this approach easy to implement anywhere. The excellent sensitivity, even when tested with asymptomatic patient samples, along with the mobile detection scheme and non-invasive sampling procedure, makes this biosensor design ideal for mass screening.","Vaquer, Andreu; Alba-Patiño, Alejandra; Adrover-Jaume, Cristina; Russell, Steven M; Aranda, María; Borges, Marcio; Mena, Joana; Castillo, Alberto Del; Socias, Antonia; Martín, Luisa; Arellano, María Magdalena; Agudo, Miguel; Gonzalez-Freire, Marta; Besalduch, Manuela; Clemente, Antonio; Barón, Enrique; de la Rica, Roberto",Sens Actuators B Chem,,650

We introduce a stepped pooled testing strategy, a probability driven approach which significantly reduces the number of tests required to identify infected individuals in a large population. Our comprehensive methodology incorporates the effect of false negative and positive rates to accurately determine not only the efficiency of pooling but also it's accuracy. Under various plausible scenarios, we show that this approach significantly reduces the cost of testing and also reduces the effective false positive rate of tests when compared to a strategy of testing every individual of a population. We also outline an optimization strategy to obtain the pool size that maximizes the efficiency of pooling given the diagnostic protocol parameters and local infection conditions.","Srivastava, Abhishek; Mishra, Anurag; Parekh, Trusha Jayant; Jena, Sampreeti",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.09780v1.pdf,650

Purpose To assess the real-life performance of radiologist emergency department chest CT interpretation for diagnosing COVID-19 during the acute phase of the pandemic, using the COVID-19 reporting and data system (CO-RADS). Materials and Methods This retrospective multicenter study included consecutive patients who presented to emergency departments in six medical centers between March and April 2020 with moderate to severe upper respiratory symptoms suspicious for COVID-19. As part of clinical practice, chest CT was obtained for primary workup and scored using the 5-point CO-RADS scheme for suspicion of COVID-19. CT was compared with SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, and a clinical reference standard established by a multidisciplinary group of clinicians based on RT-PCR, COVID-19 contact history, oxygen therapy, timing of RT-PCR testing and likely alternative diagnosis. Performance of CT was estimated using area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) analysis and diagnostic odds ratios (OR) against both reference standards. Subgroup analysis was performed based on symptom duration grouped presentations of < 48 hours, 48 hours through 7 days, and > 7 days. Results A total of 1070 patients (median age 66, IQR 54-75, 626 men) were included, of whom 536/1070 (50%) had a positive RT-PCR, 137/1070 (13%) patients were considered to have a possible or probable COVID- 19 based on the clinical reference standard. Chest CT yielded an AUC of 0.87 (95%CI 0.84-0.89) compared with RT-PCR and 0.87 (95%CI 0.85-0.89) compared with the clinical reference standard. A CO-RADS score &#8805;4 yielded an OR of 25.9 (95%CI 18.7-35.9) for a COVID-19 diagnosis by RT-PCR, and an OR of 30.6 (95%CI 21.1-44.4) by the clinical reference standard. For symptom duration of less than 48 hours, the AUC fell to 0.71 (95%CI 0.62-0.80; P<.001).

Ongoing clinical research is assessing the potential for long-term respiratory sequelae in these patients. We assessed the respiratory function in a cohort of patients after recovering from SARS-Cov-2 infection, stratified according to PaO2/FiO2 (p/F) values. METHOD: Approximately one month after hospital discharge, 86 COVID-19 patients underwent physical examination, arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis, pulmonary function tests (PFTs), and six-minute walk test (6MWT). Patients were also asked to quantify the severity of dyspnoea and cough before, during, and after hospitalization using a visual analogic scale (VAS). Seventy-six subjects with ABG during hospitalization were stratified in three groups according to their worst p/F values: above 300 (n = 38), between 200 and 300 (n = 30) and below 200 (n = 20). RESULTS: On PFTs, lung volumes were overall preserved yet, mean percent predicted residual volume was slightly reduced (74.8 ± 18.1%). Percent predicted diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) was also mildly reduced (77.2 ± 16.5%). Patients reported residual breathlessness at the time of the visit (VAS 19.8, p < 0.001). Patients with p/F below 200 during hospitalization had lower percent predicted forced vital capacity (p = 0.005), lower percent predicted total lung capacity (p = 0.012), lower DLCO (p < 0.001) and shorter 6MWT distance (p = 0.004) than patients with higher p/F. CONCLUSION: Approximately one month after hospital discharge, patients with COVID-19 can have residual respiratory impairment, including lower exercise tolerance. The extent of this impairment seems to correlate with the severity of respiratory failure during hospitalization.","Lombardi, Francesco; Calabrese, Angelo; Iovene, Bruno; Pierandrei, Chiara; Lerede, Marialessia; Varone, Francesco; Richeldi, Luca; Sgalla, Giacomo",BMC Pulm Med,,650

342995,"Human ACE2-Functionalized Gold ""Virus-Trap"" Nanostructures for Accurate Capture of SARS-CoV-2 and Single-Virus SERS Detection",2021,"The COVID19 pandemic has highlighted the lack of resilience in supply chains, as global networks fail from disruptions at single nodes and connections. Through an overview of the existing vaccine and pharmaceutical supply chain publications focusing on resilience, as well as recent papers reporting modeling of resilience in supply chains across multiple fields, we find that models for supply chain resilience are few and most of them are focused on individual dimensions of resilience rather than on comprehensive strategy necessary for scaling up vaccine production and distribution in emergency settings. We find that COVID19 resulted in a wave of interest to supply chain resilience, but publications from 2020 are narrow in focus and largely qualitative in nature; evidence-based models and measures are rare. Further, publications often focus exclusively on specific portions of the specific supply chain of interest, excluding associated supporting networks, such as transportation, social and command and control (C2) necessary for vaccine production and equitable distribution. This lack of network analysis is a major gap in the literature that needs to be bridged in order to create methods of real-time analysis and decision tools for the COVID19 vaccine supply chain. We conclude that a comprehensive, quantitative approach to network resilience that encompasses the supply chain in the context of other social and physical networks is needed in order to address the emerging challenges of a large-scale COVID-19 vaccination program. We further find that the COVID-19 pandemic underscores the necessity of positioning supply chain resilience within a multi-network context and formally incorporating temporal dimensions into analysis through the NAS definition of resilience, plan, absorb, recover, adapt, to ensure essential needs are met across all dimensions of society.","Golan, Maureen S.; Trump, Benjamin D.; Cegan, Jeffrey C.; Linkov, Igor",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14231v1.pdf,650

METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of program leadership and residents at accredited US urology residencies was administered between April 28, 2020 to March 11, 2020. Total cohort responses are reported, and subanalyses were preformed comparing responses between those in in high vs low COVID-19 geographic regions, and between program leaders vs residents. RESULTS: Program leaders from 43% of programs and residents from 18% of programs responded. Respondents reported decreased surgical volume (83%-100% varying by subspecialty), increased use of telehealth (99%), a transition to virtual educational platforms (95%) and decreased size of inpatient resident teams (90%). Most residents are participating in care of COVID-19 patients (83%) and 20% endorsed that urology residents have been re-deployed. Seventy nine percent of respondents perceive a negative impact of recent events on urology surgery training and anxiety regarding competency upon completion of residency training was more pronounced among respondents in high COVID-19 regions. CONCLUSION: Major modifications to urology training programs were implemented in response to COVID-19. Attention must be paid to the downstream effects of the training disruption on urology residents.","Fero, Katherine E; Weinberger, James M; Lerman, Steven; Bergman, Jonathan",Urology,,650

348128,Hohes Risiko für schnelle SARS-CoV-2-Ausbreitung in Seniorenheimen,2020,"Educational training in professional programs forms the foundation for how a person problem-solves throughout their career. However, training focused on only one profession ignores the value realized through collaborations among multiple professions for solving health-related problems. This is at the core of inter-professional education (IPE). Effective IPE programs can result in inter-professional collaboration and translation science endeavors across the health sciences and beyond. Recent events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the opioid crisis highlight the importance of veterinary medicine in advancing One Health through IPE. The prevalence of IPE programs in veterinary curricula, and the process by which these have been established, has not been widely described in the literature. Through an 18-question survey sent to associate deans (ADs) of 50 veterinary schools, we sought to determine the status of IPE in the veterinary curriculum. Thirty-nine schools agreed to participate, representing primarily United States (US) DVM public and private programs with some representation from Canadian, United Kingdom (UK), and Australasian programs. Schools that provide IPE courses developed their programs in collaboration with other health sciences programs across the 4-year curriculum. The perceived barriers for IPE offerings were no different between schools with or without opportunities; however, a lack of faculty and student-perceived value and lack of adequate space in the academic schedule were common threads. Our findings provide a snapshot of the current state of IPE in veterinary medical curricula, with a particular emphasis on the United States, and point to areas of programmatic need for the field.","Estrada, Amara H; Samper, Juan; Stefanou, Candice; Blue, Amy",J Vet Med Educ,,650

Such semiquantitative scoring system, namely Brixia-score, was applied in serial monitoring of such patients, showing significant prognostic value, in one of the hospitals that experienced one of the highest pandemic peaks in Italy. To solve such a challenging visual task, we adopt a weakly supervised learning strategy structured to handle different tasks (segmentation, spatial alignment, and score estimation) trained with a""from part to whole""procedure involving different datasets. In particular, we exploited a clinical dataset of almost 5,000 CXR annotated images collected in the same hospital. Our BS-Net demonstrated self-attentive behavior and a high degree of accuracy in all processing stages. Through inter-rater agreement tests and a gold standard comparison, we were able to show that our solution outperforms single human annotators in rating accuracy and consistency, thus supporting the possibility of using this tool in contexts of computer-assisted monitoring. Highly resolved (super-pixel level) explainability maps were also generated, with an original technique, to visually help the understanding of the network activity on the lung areas. We eventually tested the performance robustness of our model on a variegated public COVID-19 dataset, for which we also provide Brixia-score annotations, observing good direct generalization and fine-tuning capabilities that favorably highlight the portability of BS-Net in other clinical settings.","Signoroni, Alberto; Savardi, Mattia; Benini, Sergio; Adami, Nicola; Leonardi, Riccardo; Gibellini, Paolo; Vaccher, Filippo; Ravanelli, Marco; Borghesi, Andrea; Maroldi, Roberto; Farina, Davide",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.04603v1.pdf,650

METHODS: Patients with T2DM and moderate or severe COVID-19 infection were prospectively observed for development of new-onset DKA for one week following initiation of parenteral dexamethasone. Clinical and biochemical parameters were compared between those who developed DKA (Group A) and those who didnot (Group B). Logistic regression was done to identify independent risk-factors predicting DKA; ROC-curve analysis to determine cut-offs for the parameters in predicting DKA. RESULTS: Amongst 302 patients screened, n = 196 were finally included, of whom 13.2% (n = 26,Group A) developed DKA. Patients in Group A were younger, had lower BMI, increased severity of COVID-19 infection, higher HbA1c%, CRP, IL-6, D-dimer and procalcitonin at admission (pall < 0.02). Further, admission BMI (OR: 0.43, CI: 0.27-0.69), HbA1c % (OR: 1.68, CI: 1.16-2.43) and serum IL-6 (OR: 1.02, CI: 1.01-1.03) emerged as independent predictors for DKA. Out of these, IL-6 levels had the highest AUROC (0.93, CI: 0.89-0.98) with a cut-off of 50.95 pg/ml yielding a sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 85.2% in predicting DKA. CONCLUSION: There is significant incidence of new-onset DKA following parenteral glucocorticoids in T2DM patients with COVID-19, especially in those with BMI <25.56 kg/m2, HbA1c% >8.35% and IL-6 levels >50.95 pg/ml at admission.","Mondal, Sunetra; DasGupta, Riddhi; Lodh, Moushumi; Gorai, Ramprasad; Choudhury, Brojen; Hazra, Arindam Kumar; Ganguly, Arunangshu",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,650

The diffusion of the virus is analyzed with S-shaped logistic-curve fits on the 25 countries most affected in which the curve was more than 95% completed at the time of the writing (mid-May 2020.) A negative correlation observed between the final number of infections and the slope of the logistic curve corroborates the result obtained long time ago via an extensive simulation study. There is both theoretical arguments and experimental evidence for the existence of such correlations. The flattening of the curve results in a retardation of the curve's midpoint, which entails an increase in the final number of infections. It is possible that more lives are lost at the end by this process. Our analysis also permits evaluation of the various governments' interventions in terms of rapidity of response, efficiency of the actions taken (the amount of flattening achieved), and the number of days by which the curve was delayed. Not surprisingly, early decisive response-such as countrywide lockdown-proves to be the optimum strategy among the countries studied.","Debecker, Alain; Modis, Theodore",Technol Forecast Soc Change,,650

357686,Sulfated polysaccharides effectively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first discovered in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and soon spread around the entire world. As no effective treatment is known, prediction of disease severity is very important in order to estimate a patients outcome. Aim of this study was to evaluate routine hematology parameters in time after admission. METHODS: Data from routine blood analyses from confirmed COVID-19 cases admitted to the University Hospital of Leuven in Belgium were collected. COVID-19 patients (n = 197) were assigned to three groups: a 'non-ICU' group, a 'ICU' group and a 'deceased' group. A control group of 60 Influenza A (non-COVID-19) patients was also included. The parameters evaluated were platelet count (PLT, 109/L), hemoglobin concentration (Hb, g/dL), leukocyte count (LEU, 109/L), neutrophil count (NEU, %), eosinophil count (EO, %), lymphocyte count (LYM, %) and monocyte count (MONO, %). RESULTS: Deceased COVID-19 patients had significant lower platelet count, higher leukocyte/neutrophil count, and lower eosinophil/lymphocyte/monocyte count compared to recovered patients. Especially lymphocyte count showed important differences; they were significantly lower between day 9 and 12 after admission making this time window important in predicting clinical worsening of a patient. CONCLUSION: Patients with COVID-19 with poor outcome showed significant differences in results of routine hematological parameters compared with patients that recovered. Especially lymphocyte count can be helpful in the prediction of a patients outcome.","Blomme, S; Smets, L; Van Ranst, M; Boeckx, N; Van Laer, C",Acta Clin Belg,,650

359900,Development of a Rapid Focus Reduction Neutralization Test Assay for Measuring SARS-CoV-2 Neutralizing Antibodies,2020,"Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is an autoimmune blistering disease that targets the hemidesmosomal proteins BP180 and BP230/bullous pemphigoid antigen 1e (BPAG1e). Whereas the role of anti-BP180 antibodies has been extensively characterized, the pathogenicity of anti-BPAG1e antibodies remains unclear. The purpose of this study is to elucidate the role of antibodies to BPAG1e in the experimental BP models. We generated Bpag1 conditional knockout (Bpag1-cKO) mice, where the KO of Bpag1 is restricted to keratin 5-expressing epithelial cells. Bpag1-cKO mice were immunized with the C-terminal portion of BPAG1e, and the splenocytes were injected into Rag2-/- mice intravenously. The recipient mice presented with erosion on the feet and tails. Microscopic examination showed subepidermal blisters and a linear deposition of IgG at the dermal-epidermal junction. To assess the potential role of trauma on BP development, we inflicted surface wounds on the dorsum of the Rag2-/- recipient mice after adoptive transfer. The wounded Rag2-/- mice had increased morbidity and severity of BP-like symptoms. Moreover, the depletion of B cells from splenocytes abolished a subepidermal blistering phenotype in vivo. These findings demonstrate that antibodies to BPAG1e might play a pathogenic role in causing subepidermal blistering, and external factors, including trauma, might be a trigger for BP development.","Makita, Eiko; Matsuzaki, Yasushi; Fukui, Tomohisa; Matsui, Akinobu; Minakawa, Satoko; Nakano, Hajime; Ito, Koichi; Kijima, Hiroshi; Sawamura, Daisuke",J. invest. dermatol,,650

360766,A Recombinant Protein SARS-CoV-2 Candidate Vaccine Elicits High-titer Neutralizing Antibodies in Macaques,2021,"Background: Liver injury is commonly seen in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the mechanism behind liver injury, particularly in severe and critical COVID-19 patients, remains unclear and the clinical course is poorly described. Methods: We conducted a single-center, retrospective cohort study of consecutive hospitalized severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients with or without liver injury who underwent immunologic testing (IL-6, IL-8, TNF-&#945;, and IL-1ß). Liver injury was defined as peak aminotransferases &#8805;3x ULN (40 U/L) or &#8805;120 U/L. Patients with liver injury were compared to those who had normal aminotransferases throughout the hospital course. Results: 176 patients were studied; 109 with liver injury and 67 controls. Patients with liver injury were more likely to be male (71.6% vs 37.3%; p < 0.001). Peak inflammatory markers and IL-6 were higher in the liver injury group: CRP: 247 vs 168 mg/L, p < 0.001; LDH: 706 vs 421 U/L, ferritin: 2,973 vs 751 ng/mL, p < 0.001, IL-6: 121.0 vs 71.8, p < 0.001. There was no difference in the levels of IL-8, TNF-&#945;, and IL-1ß. The liver injury group had a longer length of stay and more severe COVID-19 despite having less diabetes and chronic kidney disease. Discussion: An exaggerated hyper inflammatory response (cytokine storm) characterized by significantly elevated CRP, LDH, ferritin, and IL-6 levels and increasing severity of COVID-19 appears to be associated with the occurrence of liver injury in patients with severe/ critical COVID-19.","Da, Ben L; Kushner, Tatyana; El Halabi, Maan; Paka, Pavan; Khalid, Mian; Uberoi, Angad; Lee, Brian T; Perumalswami, Ponni V; Rutledge, Stephanie M; Schiano, Thomas D; Friedman, Scott; Saberi, Behnam",,,650

The COVID-19 epidemic posed an increased risk of treatment delay causing increased DTC morbidity and mortality rate of DTC. Several imaging techniques, including ultrasound (US), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and computer tomography (CT), have been applied in the early screening and diagnosis of DTC. However, these traditional methods have limited sensitivity and specificity due to dependence on the experience and skill of the radiologists. Radiomics is an emerging technique that allows the quantitative extraction of high-throughput features from single or multiple medical images, which cannot be observed directly with the naked eye, and then applies to machine learning approaches to construct classification or prediction models. This method makes it possible to evaluate tumor status and to differentiate malignant from benign tumors or nodules in a more objective manner. To date, the classification and prediction value of radiomics in DTC patients have been inconsistent. Herein, we summarize the available literature on the classification and prediction performance of radiomics-based DTC in various imaging techniques. More specifically, we reviewed the recent literature to discuss the capacity of radiomics to predict lymph node (LN) metastasis, distant metastasis, tumor extrathyroidal extension, disease-free survival, and B-Raf proto-oncogene serine/threonine kinase (BRAF) mutation and differentiate malignant from benign nodules. This review discusses the application and limitations of the radiomics process, and explores its ability to improve clinical decision-making with the hope of emphasizing its utility for DTC patients.

362565,Screening and druggability analysis of some plant metabolites against SARS-CoV-2: An integrative computational approach,2020,"Negative attitudes and stigmatization can originate from the perception of a disease-related threat. Following the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is often suggested that incidents of discriminatory behavior are the result of defense mechanisms aimed at avoiding pathogens. According to the behavioral immune system theory, people are motivated to distance themselves from individuals who show signs of infection, or who are only heuristically associated with a disease, primarily because of the disgust they evoke. In this paper we focus on negative attitudes toward gay men and lesbians who are among social groups that have been persistently framed as ""unclean."" In our correlational study (N = 500 heterosexual participants;Polish sample data collected during the first COVID-19 lockdown in Poland, in March/April 2020) we tested moderation models derived from the behavioral immune system theory. Specifically, we investigated whether perceived vulnerability to disease and perceived threat of contracting COVID-19 moderate the relation between disgust and homonegativity. We found that sexual disgust (but not pathogen nor moral disgust) predicted homonegative attitudes. This effect was stronger for participants expressing higher levels of perceived vulnerability to disease but was not dependent on the perception of the COVID-19 threat. The results reaffirm previous evidence indicating a pivotal role of disgust in disease-avoidance mechanisms. They also point to functional flexibility of the behavioral immune system by demonstrating the moderating role of perceived vulnerability to disease in shaping homonegative attitudes. Finally, they show that the threat of COVID-19 does not strengthen the relationship between disgust and homonegativity.","Szymkow, A.; Frankowska, N.; Galasinska, K.",Frontiers in Psychology,,650

Having regard to the prevalence of sleep and circadian rhythm disorders and a clear tendency to increase the demand for melatonin, and the current lack of alternative green and cost-efficient technologies of its synthesis, the supply of this remedy will not be enough to guarantee melatonin supply and affordability on a global scale. The emergence of naturally occurring melatonin and its isomers in fermented foods has opened an exciting new research area; there are still, however, some obscure points in the efficient microbiological biosynthesis of melatonin. This review summarizes the research progress and recent evidence related to melatonin and its isomers in various foodstuffs. Additionally, one possible way to synthesize melatonin is also discussed. The evidence pointed out that the presence of melatonin and its isomers is not exclusive for grapes and grape-derived products, because it can be also found in sweet and sour cherries. However, different species of both Saccharomyces and non-Saccharomyces yeasts could be used to obtain melatonin and melatonin isomers in the process of alcoholic fermentation biotechnologically. The availability of L-tryptophan has been a key factor in determining the concentration of indolic compounds produced, and the utilization of probiotic lactic acid bacteria could help in the formation of melatonin isomers during malolactic fermentation. These approaches are environmentally friendly alternatives with a safer profile than conventional ones and could represent the future for sustainable industrial-scale melatonin production.","Juhnevica-Radenkova, Karina; Moreno, Diego A; Ikase, Laila; Drudze, Inese; Radenkovs, Vitalijs",Compr Rev Food Sci Food Saf,,650

Objective: The aim was to investigate the frequency and severity of STD in COVID-19 patients and to evaluate the association with demographic characteristics, hospital admission, symptoms, comorbidities, and blood biomarkers. METHODS: A multicenter cross-sectional study on SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (n=846) and controls (n=143) from 15 Spanish Hospitals. Data of STD with an in-person survey was collected prospectively. STD severity was categorized by visual analogue scale. STD onset time, recovery rate, time to recovery, hospital admission, pneumonia diagnosis, comorbidities, smoking and symptoms were analyzed. RESULTS: STD were at least 2-fold more common in COVID-19-positive compared to controls. In COVID-19-positive, hospitalized patients were older, with lower frequency of STD and recovered earlier than out-patients. Stratified analysis by severity of STD showed that more than a half of COVID-19 subjects presented severe loss of smell (53.7%) or taste (52.2%), in >90% this impairment was of both senses. In the multivariate analysis, an older age (>60yo), being hospitalized and an increased level of C-reactive protein were factors associated with a better sense of smell and/or taste. COVID-19-positive patients reported improvement of smell (45.6%) and taste (46.1%) at the time of the survey, 90.6% in less than two weeks' post-infection. CONCLUSIONS: STD is a common symptom in COVID-19, and mainly present in young and non-hospitalized patients.

To examine the accuracy of official estimates of governmental health spending in the United States.Methods. We coded approximately 2.7 million administrative spending records from 2000 to 2018 for public health activities according to a standardized Uniform Chart of Accounts produced by the Public Health Activities and Services Tracking project. The official US Public Health Activity estimate was recalculated using updated estimates from the data coding.Results. Although official estimates place governmental public health spending at more than $93 billion (2.5% of total spending on health), detailed examination of spending records from state governments shows that official estimates include substantial spending on individual health care services (e.g., behavioral health) and that actual spending on population-level public health activities is more likely between $35 billion and $64 billion (approximately 1.5% of total health spending).Conclusions. Clarity in understanding of public health spending is critical for characterizing its value proposition. Official estimates are likely tens of billions of dollars greater than actual spending.Public Health Implications. Precise and clear spending estimates are material for policymakers to accurately understand the effect of their resource allocation decisions.","Leider, Jonathon P; Resnick, Beth; McCullough, J Mac; Alfonso, Y Natalia; Bishai, David",Am J Public Health,,650

This study has therefore analyzed the epidemiological characteristics and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients in Northwestern China, an area with low population density. Methods: From January 21 to March 11, 2020, data from patients diagnosed with novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) in areas of Northwestern China with lower population densities were retrospectively analyzed. Certain variables were categorized as numbers and percentages, with the ratio between resident patients (no history of going out during the epidemic) and imported patients representing the contagiousness of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) responsible for COVID-19. Hospitalization time was also calculated. Results: A total of 617 COVID-19 patients were reported in Northwestern China, and the morbidity and mortality rates of 0.000005 and 0.011, respectively. Further analysis showed that the morbidity was inversely proportional to population density and distance from Wuhan City. This study enrolled 473 confirmed cases; among these patients, there were 248 residents and 225 imported cases with a ratio of 1:1. The youngest and oldest patients were 1 and 94 years of age, respectively, with a median age of 42 years. Fifteen (3.2%) patients were children or infants. Two patients were pregnant, and one patient gave birth to a healthy baby with negative results during her disease course. About 17.3% of patients (82 cases) were healthy carriers without any symptoms during their disease course. One male patient (0.2%) had recurrence of a positive test result 4 days after discharge. The median hospitalization time was 16.0 days, ranging from 2.0 to 43.0 days. Further analysis showed that age (P = 0.03) and severity status (P < 0.001) were significantly correlated with hospitalization time. Conclusions: The morbidity and mortality rates of COVID-19 patients in the regions with a low population density were lower than those of the national average in China. All populations were susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2. Asymptomatic patients with positive results should be taken seriously, and the hospitalization time of patients is associated with their age and severity status.","Zhu, Jianfei; Zhang, Qingqing; Jia, Chenghui; Wang, Wuping; Chen, Jiakuan; Xia, Yanmin; Wang, Wenchen; Wang, Xuejiao; Wen, Miaomiao; Wang, Hongtao; Zhang, Zhipei; Xu, Shuonan; Zhao, Jinbo; Jiang, Tao",Front Med (Lausanne),,650

Because educational attainment (EA), which measures the number of years of schooling, is moderately heritable, we investigated the causal association of EA on the risk of COVID-19 severity using the Mendelian randomization (MR) approach. A two-sample MR analysis was performed using publicly available summary-level data sets of genome-wide association studies (GWASs). A total of 235 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were extracted as instrumental variables for the exposure of EA from the Social Science Genetic Association Consortium GWAS summary data of 766,345 participants of European ancestry. The effect of each SNP on the outcome of COVID-19 severity risk was obtained from the GWAS summary data of 1,059,456 participants of European ancestry gathered from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative. Using inverse variance weighted method, our MR study shows that EA was significantly associated with a lower risk of COVID-19 severity (odds ratio per one standard deviation increase in years of schooling, 0.540; 95% confidence interval, 0.376-0.777, P = 0.0009). A series of sensitivity analyses showed little evidence of bias. In conclusion, we show for the first time using a two-sample MR approach the associations between higher EA and the lower risk of COVID-19 severity in the European population. However, the genetic or epidemiological mechanisms underlying the association between EA and the risk of COVID-19 severity remain unknown, and further studies are warranted to validate the MR findings and investigate underlying mechanisms.","Yoshikawa, Masahiro; Asaba, Kensuke",Front Public Health,,650

The coagulopathy and cerebral hemorrhage have been recently reported in these patients. Prolonged acetaminophen use increases the international normalized ratio (INR) and the risk of bleeding among patients taking anti-coagulants. Inhibition of vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR) by acetaminophen and NAC in chronic applications has been reported, however, detailed knowledge of the molecular mechanism and binding sites are not clear. Herein, we built the homology model of human VKOR (hVKOR) using ITASSER server, confirmed, and applied it for docking analysis of its interaction with acetaminophen and its metabolite, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), and NAC. We also calculated the lipophilicity and predicted the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) permeation of NAPQI by Swiss ADME. Our analysis showed that NAPQI and NAC, but not acetaminophen, bind strongly to the similar sites in hVKOR via both hydrogen and van der Waals bonding; particularly with Cys135. Thus, it interrupted the vitamin K reducing electron transfer pathway. Further, molecular dynamic (MD) simulation study revealed that the interactions of the ligands with hVKOR are stable. In conclusion, our analysis shed a light on the molecular mechanism of acetaminophen-induced coagulopathy previously reported in some clinical cases with chronic acetaminophen use. Furthermore, considering the anti-coagulopathy of NAPQI and NAC but not acetaminophen, the BBB permeation potency of these agents, and the risk of coagulopathy in COVID-19, we suggest a regular prothrombin time (PT) and INR monitoring of these patients taking acetaminophen and/or NAC.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

In this study, however, we show that a single layer of a surgical mask can atomize a cough droplet into numerous tiny droplets, thereby significantly increasing the total population of aerosols ejected during a single human cough. Although droplets of a broader size distribution are ejected during coughs, we focused our attention towards a relatively large droplet size (~ 620 {\mu}m), which shows great affinity to undergo atomization during its penetration through the mask layers. The entire phenomenon was captured using a high-speed shadowgraphy imaging technique at a recording rate of 6500 fps. The single-layer masks were found to be ineffective in restraining cough droplets while no penetration could be noticed for a triple-layer mask. This is because a single-layer or double-layer face mask causes atomization of the droplets resulting in the formation of larger number of droplets with smaller sizes (<100 {\mu}m). These tiny droplets can aerosolize in the immediate environment and can remain suspended for a longer time. Thus, it is recommended to avoid the use of a single-layer or double-layer surgical face mask as a physical obstruction to the ejected cough droplets for controlling the spread of the COVID-19 virus.","Sharma, Shubham; Pinto, Roven; Saha, Abhishek; Chaudhuri, Swetaprovo; Basu, Saptarshi",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.00591v1.pdf,650

Because the drafting, adoption, and implementation of policies regulating LFP is under the purview of local governments in many U.S. states, researchers at University of Florida, Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences Extension conducted a study to assess whether COVID-19 affected local government stakeholders' (LGS) (N=92) perspectives on LFP and the role that LFP can play in responding to public health emergencies. LGS who oversee the drafting, adoption, and implementation of LFP policies include staff responsible for code enforcement, sustainability initiatives, and planning, as well as elected and appointed leaders, such as mayors, city and county managers, and city and county commissioners. The survey assessed LGS' attitudes and knowledge about LFP. The survey also asked LGS about their perceptions and awareness of LFP in their communities, including their perceptions of the benefits of and barriers to LFP and the ways in which LFP producers were using the food they produced. Survey questions also focused specifically on COVID-19 and the role of LFP in public health emergencies. In particular, survey questions asked whether LGS perceived a change in their own attitudes, knowledge, and perspectives;whether there had been a change in the LFP activities in their communities following COVID-19;and what they thought the role of LFP was in responding to public health emergencies. Direct comparisons of LGS who responded to a 2019 survey (N=43) were assessed for statistically significant changes in overall attitudes, knowledge, or perceived benefits of LFP following COVID-19. This study found that LGS have generally positive attitudes and perceptions of benefits of LFP, including its role in public health emergencies, but have limited knowledge about LFP or awareness of barriers to its implementation. The results of this study indicate that LGS understand the potential benefits of LFP in public health emergencies but would benefit from information and training to support the development of policies and programs in their communities.","Campbell, C.

We found elevated levels of circulating endothelial cells (CECs), a biomarker of vascular injury, in COVID-19 convalescents compared to healthy controls. In particular, those with pre-existing conditions (e.g., hypertension, diabetes) had more pronounced endothelial activation hallmarks than non-COVID-19 patients with matched cardiovascular risk. Several proinflammatory and activated T lymphocyte-associated cytokines sustained from acute infection to recovery phase, which correlated positively with CEC measures, implicating cytokine-driven endothelial dysfunction. Notably, we found higher frequency of effector T cells in our COVID-19 convalescents compared to healthy controls. The activation markers detected on CECs mapped to counter receptors found primarily on cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, raising the possibility of cytotoxic effector cells targeting activated endothelial cells.

368343,The percentages of SARS-CoV-2 protein similarity and identity with SARS-CoV and BatCoV RaTG13 proteins can be used as indicators of virus origin,2021,"BACKGROUND Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a life-threatening disease characterized by an intense immunologic response that results in multiorgan dysfunction. It typically manifests as a result of a familial genetic immunodeficiency disorder or secondary to a trigger such as an infection, malignancy, or autoimmune disease. The major factors involved in the development of the disease are an individual's genetic propensity to develop HLH, such as rare associated mutations, or inflammatory processes that trigger the immune system to go haywire. CASE REPORT Before the COVID-19 pandemic, a 22-year-old woman with a history of congenital absence of the right kidney, right-sided hearing loss, and leukopenia presented with a 3-week history of generalized malaise, fever, chest pain, cough, and shortness of breath. She developed an acute systemic cytomegalovirus infection further complicated by HLH. Based on her history and clinical course, an underlying primary immunodeficiency was suspected. An immunodeficiency gene panel revealed a monoallelic mutation in GATA2, a gene that encodes zinc-transcription factors responsible for the regulation of hematopoiesis. CONCLUSIONS GATA2 deficiency encompasses a large variety of mutations in the GATA2 gene and leads to disorders associated with hematologic and immunologic manifestations of monocytopenia and B-, and natural killer-cell deficiency. Over time, affected individuals are at high risk of developing life-threatening infections and serious hematologic complications, such as myelodysplastic syndromes and/or leukemias. We aimed to illustrate the importance of identifying an underlying genetic disorder associated with secondary HLH to help guide acute and long-term management.","Burak, Nicole; Jan, Naveed; Kessler, Jason; Oei, Erwin; Patel, Priya; Feldman, Scott",Am J Case Rep,,650

Our specification that assumes the growth rate of active infections can be represented by autoregressive fluctuations around a downward sloping deterministic trend function with a break. Our fully Bayesian approach allows us to flexibly estimate the cross-sectional distribution of slopes and then implicitly use this distribution as prior to construct Bayes forecasts for the individual time series. We find some evidence that information from locations with an early outbreak can sharpen forecast accuracy for late locations. There is generally a lot of uncertainty about the evolution of active infection, due to parameter and shock uncertainty, in particular before and around the peak of the infection path. Over a one-week horizon, the empirical coverage frequency of our interval forecasts is close to the nominal credible level.

370389,SARS-CoV-2 Nsp16 activation mechanism and a cryptic pocket with pan-coronavirus antiviral potential,2021,OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: the current understanding of the interplay between cardiovascular (CV) risk and Covid-19 is grossly inadequate. CV risk-prediction models are used to identify and treat high risk populations and to communicate risk effectively. These tools are unexplored in Covid-19. The main objective is to evaluate the association between CV scoring systems and chest X ray (CXR) examination (in terms of severity of lung involvement) in 50 Italian Covid-19 patients. Results only the Framingham Risk Score (FRS) was applicable to all patients. The Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Score (ASCVD) was applicable to half. 62% of patients were classified as high risk according to FRS and 41% according to ASCVD. Patients who died had all a higher FRS compared to survivors. They were all hypertensive. FRS&#8805;30 patients had a 9.7 higher probability of dying compared to patients with a lower FRS. We found a strong correlation between CXR severity and FRS and ASCVD (P < 0.001). High CV risk patients had consolidations more frequently. CXR severity was significantly associated with hypertension and diabetes. 71% of hypertensive patients' CXR and 88% of diabetic patients' CXR had consolidations. Patients with diabetes or hypertension had 8 times greater risk of having consolidations. CONCLUSIONS: High CV risk correlates with more severe CXR pattern and death. Diabetes and hypertension are associated with more severe CXR. FRS offers more predictive utility and fits best to our cohort. These findings may have implications for clinical practice and for the identification of high-risk groups to be targeted for the vaccine precedence.,"Mozzini, Chiara; Cicco, Sebastiano; Setti, Angela; Racanelli, Vito; Vacca, Angelo; Calciano, Lucia; Pesce, Giancarlo; Girelli, Domenico",Curr Probl Cardiol,,650

The genetic background of the host might account for individual responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection besides age and comorbidities. A list of candidate polymorphisms is needed to drive targeted screens, given the existence of frequent polymorphisms in the general population. We carried out text mining in the scientific literature to draw up a list of genes referable to the term ""SARS-CoV*"". We looked for frequent mutations that are likely to affect protein function in these genes. Ten genes, mostly involved in innate immunity, and thirteen common variants were identified, for some of these the involvement in COVID-19 is supported by publicly available epidemiological data. We looked for available data on the population distribution of these variants and we demonstrated that the prevalence of five of them, Arg52Cys (rs5030737), Gly54Asp (rs1800450) and Gly57Glu (rs1800451) in MBL2, Ala59Thr (rs25680) in CD27, and Val197Met (rs12329760) in TMPRSS2, correlates with the number of cases and/or deaths of COVID-19 observed in different countries. The association of the TMPRSS2 variant provides epidemiological evidence of the usefulness of transmembrane protease serine 2 inhibitors for the cure of COVID-19.

Few studies have reported data on placental morphology and histology in infected pregnant patients, although not compared with carefully matched controls. The aim of this study is to compare placental morphology and histology of pregnant women affected by SARS-CoV-2 to non-infected controls. METHODS: This is a prospective multicenter case-control study on 64 pregnant women affected by SARS-CoV-2 who delivered at term or late-preterm. Data were collected about pregnancy course, maternal and fetal outcomes, placental biometry and macro- and microscopical morphology. 64 not-infected women were identified as controls, matched by age, body mass index and ethnicity. RESULTS: Cases and controls had similar fetal and maternal outcomes. No significant differences were observed in placental macro- or microscopical morphology between the two groups. In the cases treated with antivirals, chloroquine, LMWH or antibiotics, placentas were heavier but not more efficient than the non-treated, since the fetal/placental weight ratio did not differ. Moreover, delayed villous maturation was more frequent in treated women, although not significantly. The newborns whose mothers received oxygen therapy as treatment had higher levels of umbilical cord pO2 at birth. DISCUSSION: In this prospective case-control study, SARS-CoV-2 infection during the third trimester did not influence placental histological pattern. Pharmacological and oxygen therapy administered to women affected by this viral infection could impact maternal and fetal outcomes and be associated to placental histological alterations.","Tasca, Chiara; Rossi, Roberta Simona; Corti, Silvia; Anelli, Gaia Maria; Savasi, Valeria; Brunetti, Federica; Cardellicchio, Manuela; Caselli, Emilio; Tonello, Cristina; Vergani, Patrizia; Nebuloni, Manuela; Cetin, Irene",Placenta,,650

As well as in a clinical context, also in a medico-legal setting the diagnosis of sepsis can reveal challenging due to the unspecificity of the signs detected during autopsies, especially when no ante-mortem clinical data, laboratory, and cultural results are available. Thus, a systematic review of literature was performed to provide an overview of the main available and updated forensic tools for the post-mortem diagnosis of sepsis. Moreover, the aim of this review was to evaluate whether a marker or a combination of markers exist, specific enough to allow a correct and definite post-mortem diagnosis. The review was conducted searching in PubMed and Scopus databases, and using variable combinations of the keywords ""post mortem sepsis diagnosis"", ""macroscopic signs"", ""morphology"", ""histology"", ""immunohistochemical markers"", ""biochemical markers"", and ""forensic microbiology"". The article selection was carried out following specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. A total of 44 works was identified, providing data on morphological aspects of the organs examined, histological findings, immunohistochemical and biochemical markers, and cultural assays. The review findings suggested that the post-mortem diagnosis of sepsis can be achieved by a combination of data obtained from macroscopic and microscopic analysis and microbial investigations, associated with the increased levels of at least two of three biochemical and/or immunohistochemical markers evaluated simultaneously on blood samples.","Stassi, Chiara; Mondello, Cristina; Baldino, Gennaro; Ventura Spagnolo, Elvira",,,650

Although neurological symptoms are being reported worldwide, neural acute and long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 are still unknown. COVID-19 complications are associated with exacerbated immunoinflammatory responses to SARS-CoV-2 invasion. In this scenario, pro-inflammatory factors are intensely released into the bloodstream, causing the so-called ""cytokine storm"". Both pro-inflammatory factors and viruses may cross the blood-brain barrier and enter the central nervous system, activating neuroinflammatory responses accompanied by hemorrhagic lesions and neuronal impairment, which are largely described processes in psychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 infection could trigger and/or worse brain diseases. Moreover, patients with central nervous system disorders associated to neuroimmune activation (e.g. depression, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease) may present increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or achieve severe conditions. Elevated levels of extracellular ATP induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection may trigger hyperactivation of P2X7 receptors leading to NLRP3 inflammasome stimulation as a key mediator of neuroinvasion and consequent neuroinflammatory processes, as observed in psychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. In this context, P2X7 receptor antagonism could be a promising strategy to prevent or treat neurological complications in COVID-19 patients.","Ribeiro, Deidiane Elisa; Oliveira-Giacomelli, Ágatha; Glaser, Talita; Arnaud-Sampaio, Vanessa F; Andrejew, Roberta; Dieckmann, Luiz; Baranova, Juliana; Lameu, Claudiana; Ratajczak, Mariusz Z; Ulrich, Henning",Mol. psychiatry,,650

However, synthesizing knowledge from past pandemics can help to anticipate this, along with identifying interventions required, when, and target populations most in need. This paper provides a balanced evaluation of what is currently known about short- and long-term MH impacts of pandemics on HCWs and effect of methodological limitations on knowledge claims. Method: A rapid evidence assessment (REA) was conducted on 41 studies published in the past two decades that examined MH outcomes for HCWs in relation to pandemics. Results: Findings of literary synthesis highlight common MH outcomes across pandemics, including increased stress, distress, burnout, and anxiety in the short-term, and post-traumatic stress and depression in the long-term. Findings also show the key role that organizations and public health bodies play in promoting adaptive coping and reducing health worries and the emotional and psychological distress caused by this. Evidence highlights particular groups at risk of developing MH issues (contact with patients that are infected, having children), and time points where risk may increase (initial response phase, when quarantined). However, inconsistencies in measures, analysis, and reporting all create limitations for pooling data. Conclusions: Findings can be used by researchers to provide a knowledge framework to inform future research that will assist HCWs in responding to pandemics, and by policy makers and service planners to provide an evidence-led brief about direction and evidence base for related policy initiatives, interventions or service programmes.","Waring, Sara; Giles, Susan",Front Public Health,,650
380556,Molecular Dynamic Simulations of Folding and Dimerization in Mutations Found in the s2m Motif of SARS-Cov-2,2021,"BACKGROUND: Data on the characteristics of COVID-19 patients disaggregated by race/ethnicity remain limited. We evaluated the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of patients across racial/ethnic groups and assessed their associations with COVID-19 outcomes. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study examined 629,953 patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 in a large health system spanning California, Oregon, and Washington between March 1 and December 31, 2020. Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were obtained from electronic health records. Odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 hospitalization, and in-hospital death were assessed with multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: 570,298 patients with known race/ethnicity were tested for SARS-CoV-2, of whom 27.8% were non-White minorities. 54,645 individuals tested positive, with minorities representing 50.1%. Hispanics represented 34.3% of infections but only 13.4% of tests. While generally younger than White patients, Hispanics had higher rates of diabetes but fewer other comorbidities. 8,536 patients were hospitalized and 1,246 died, of whom 56.1% and 54.4% were non-White, respectively. Racial/ethnic distributions of outcomes across the health system tracked with state-level statistics. Increased odds of testing positive and hospitalization were associated with all minority races/ethnicities. Hispanic patients also exhibited increased morbidity, and Hispanic race/ethnicity was associated with in-hospital mortality (OR: 1.39 [95% CI: 1.14-1.70]). CONCLUSION: Major healthcare disparities were evident, especially among Hispanics who tested positive at a higher rate, required excess hospitalization and mechanical ventilation, and had higher odds of in-hospital mortality despite younger age. Targeted, culturally-responsive interventions and equitable vaccine development and distribution are needed to address the increased risk of poorer COVID-19 outcomes among minority populations.","Dai, Chengzhen L; Kornilov, Sergey A; Roper, Ryan T; Cohen-Cline, Hannah; Jade, Kathleen; Smith, Brett; Heath, James R; Diaz, George; Goldman, Jason D; Magis, Andrew T; Hadlock, Jennifer J",Clin. infect. dis,,650

380929,Mutational Asymmetries in the SARS-CoV-2 Genome May Lead to Increased Hydrophobicity of Virus Proteins,2021,"BACKGROUND: Self-reported pre-pregnancy weight and weight measured in the first trimester are both used to estimate pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) and gestational weight gain (GWG) but there is limited information on how they compare, especially in low- and middle-income countries, where access to a weight scale can be limited. Thus, the main goal of this study was to evaluate the agreement between self-reported pre-pregnancy weight and weight measured during the first trimester of pregnancy among Brazilian women so as to assess whether self-reported pre-pregnancy weight is reliable and can be used for calculation of BMI and GWG. METHODS: Data from the Brazilian Maternal and Child Nutrition Consortium (BMCNC, n = 5563) and the National Food and Nutritional Surveillance System (SISVAN, n = 393,095) were used to evaluate the agreement between self-reported pre-pregnancy weight and weights measured in three overlapping intervals (30-94, 30-60 and 30-45 days of pregnancy) and their impact in BMI classification. We calculated intraclass correlation and Lin's concordance coefficients, constructed Bland and Altman plots, and determined Kappa coefficient for the categories of BMI. RESULTS: The mean of the differences between self-reported and measured weights was < 2 kg during the three intervals examined for BMCNC (1.42, 1.39 and 1.56 kg) and about 1 kg for SISVAN (1.0, 1.1 and 1.2 kg). Intraclass correlation and Lin's coefficient were > 0.90 for both datasets in all time intervals. Bland and Altman plots showed that the majority of the difference laid in the ±2 kg interval and that the differences did not vary according to measured first-trimester BMI. Kappa coefficient values were > 0.80 for both datasets at all intervals. Using self-reported pre-pregnancy or measured weight would change, in total, the classification of BMI in 15.9, 13.5, and 12.2% of women in the BMCNC and 12.1, 10.7, and 10.2% in the SISVAN, at 30-94, 30-60 and 30-45 days, respectively. CONCLUSION: In Brazil, self-reported pre-pregnancy weight can be used for calculation of BMI and GWG when an early measurement of weight during pregnancy is not available. These results are especially important in a country where the majority of woman do not initiate prenatal care early in pregnancy.","Rangel Bousquet Carrilho, Thaís; M Rasmussen, Kathleen; Rodrigues Farias, Dayana; Freitas Costa, Nathalia Cristina; Araújo Batalha, Mônica; E Reichenheim, Michael; O Ohuma, Eric; Hutcheon, Jennifer A; Kac, Gilberto",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,,650

Children mimic many syndromes with a combination of nonspecific symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many syndromes are triggered by changes in children's body conditions. Reporting specific cases can improve the diagnosis process. The present study reports an 18-month-old paediatric case of COVID-19 who presented ketoacidosis (DKA) symptoms. CASE PRESENTATION: The case is an 18-month-old child with fever and diarrhoea from 3 days before, who did not respond to outpatient treatment. On the day of the visit, he suffered from deep and abdominal breathing and decreased level of consciousness and sugar levels at admission of 420 mg/dl. He was then admitted with the initial diagnosis of DKA and had a positive PCR test result for COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the non-specific symptoms of COVID-19, general practitioners and paediatricians are recommended that special attention be paid to these symptoms, especially those that are similar to life-threatening syndromes. They also should not easily ignore these symptoms and follow up patients and their recovery status and, if patients do not recover, consider the risk of COVID-19 given the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Akbarizadeh, Majidreza; Naderifar, Mahin; Ghanizadegan, Parisa; Akbarizadeh, Mahshid",Pediatr.

382662,Structural Basis and Mode of Action for Two Broadly Neutralizing Antibodies Against SARS-CoV-2 Emerging Variants of Concern,2021,"Rationale: Initial reports of case fatality rates (CFRs) among adults with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) receiving invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) are highly variable.Objectives: To examine the CFR of patients with COVID-19 receiving IMV.Methods: Two authors independently searched PubMed, Embase, medRxiv, bioRxiv, the COVID-19 living systematic review, and national registry databases. The primary outcome was the ""reported CFR"" for patients with confirmed COVID-19 requiring IMV. ""Definitive hospital CFR"" for patients with outcomes at hospital discharge was also investigated. Finally, CFR was analyzed by patient age, geographic region, and study quality on the basis of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.Measurements and Results: Sixty-nine studies were included, describing 57,420 adult patients with COVID-19 who received IMV. Overall reported CFR was estimated as 45% (95% confidence interval [CI], 39-52%). Fifty-four of 69 studies stated whether hospital outcomes were available but provided a definitive hospital outcome on only 13,120 (22.8%) of the total IMV patient population. Among studies in which age-stratified CFR was available, pooled CFR estimates ranged from 47.9% (95% CI, 46.4-49.4%) in younger patients (age &#8804;40 yr) to 84.4% (95% CI, 83.3-85.4%) in older patients (age >80 yr). CFR was also higher in early COVID-19 epicenters. Overall heterogeneity is high (I2 >90%), with nonsignificant Egger's regression test suggesting no publication bias.Conclusions: Almost half of patients with COVID-19 receiving IMV died based on the reported CFR, but variable CFR reporting methods resulted in a wide range of CFRs between studies. The reported CFR was higher in older patients and in early pandemic epicenters, which may be influenced by limited ICU resources. Reporting of definitive outcomes on all patients would facilitate comparisons between studies.Systematic review registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020186997).","Lim, Zheng Jie; Subramaniam, Ashwin; Ponnapa Reddy, Mallikarjuna; Blecher, Gabriel; Kadam, Umesh; Afroz, Afsana; Billah, Baki; Ashwin, Sushma; Kubicki, Mark; Bilotta, Federico; Curtis, J Randall; Rubulotta, Francesca",Am J Respir Crit Care Med,,650

The minute-to-minute increasing coronavirus cases (>85 M) and progressive deaths (&#8776;1.8 M) calls for finding a cure to this devastating pandemic. While there have been many attempts to find biologically active molecules targeting SARS-CoV-2 for treatment of this viral infection, none has found a way to the clinic yet. In this study, a 3-feature structure-based pharmacophore model was designed for SARS-CoV-2 main protease (MPro) that plays a vital role in the viral cellular penetration. High throughput virtual screening of the lead-like ZINC library was then performed to find a potent inhibitor employing the predesigned pharmacophore. In-silico pharmacokinetics/toxicity prediction study was subsequently applied towards the best hits. Finally, a 50 ns molecular dynamics simulation was carried out for the best hit and compared to the co-crystallized ligand where the hit compound displayed high binding and comparable interactions. The results identified new hits for SARS-CoV-2 MPro inhibition showing good docking score, pharmacokinetics and toxicity profile, drug-likeness, high binding energy in addition to a promising synthetic accessibility. Identifying new small compounds as potential leads for inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 is a very important step towards designing a synthesizing of promising drug candidates.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

New agents that address the hyperinflammatory ""cytokine storm"" and hypercoagulable pathology seen in these patients may be a promising approach to treat patients, minimize hospital stays, and ensure hospital wards and critical care units are able to operate effectively. Dociparstat sodium (DSTAT) is a glycosaminoglycan derivative of heparin with robust anti-inflammatory properties, with the potential to address underlying causes of coagulation disorders with substantially reduced risk of bleeding compared to commercially available heparin. METHODS: This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2/3 trial to determine the safety and efficacy of DSTAT added to standard of care in hospitalized adults with COVID-19 who require supplemental oxygen. Phase 2 will enroll 12 participants in each of two dose-escalating cohorts to confirm the safety of DSTAT in this population. Following review of the data, an additional 50 participants will be enrolled. Contingent upon positive results, phase 3 will enroll approximately 450 participants randomized to DSTAT or placebo. The primary endpoint is the proportion of participants who survive and do not require mechanical ventilation through day 28. DISCUSSION: Advances in standard of care, recent emergency use authorizations, and positive data with dexamethasone have likely contributed to an increasing proportion of patients who are surviving without the need for mechanical ventilation. Therefore, examining the time to improvement in the NIAID score will be essential to provide a measure of drug effect on recovery. Analysis of additional endpoints, including supportive biomarkers (e.g., IL-6, HMGB1, soluble-RAGE, D-dimer), will be performed to further define the effect of DSTAT in patients with COVID-19 infection.

392508,A recombinant receptor-binding domain in trimeric form generates protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection in nonhuman primates,2021,"PROBLEM: The speed and scope of the upheaval that COVID-19 inflicted on medical education made innovation a necessity. While medical students wanted high-quality, consolidated educational resources on COVID-19, the medical school faculty who typically produced such resources were increasingly burdened with clinical, administrative, and personal commitments. However, students eager to contribute to the pandemic response were well-suited to create these instructional materials for their peers. APPROACH: In mid-March 2020, a group of students at Harvard Medical School came together to synthesize the key facts and collate the best existing educational materials about the COVID-19 pandemic into a unified learning resource. The materials were faculty reviewed and shared freely online. The curriculum now contains 8 modules that are updated regularly. Throughout this process, the student authors prioritized accessibility, iterative improvement, and effective pedagogy. OUTCOMES: To date, nearly 80,000 users from 132 countries have accessed the curriculum. It has been referenced or incorporated into courses at Harvard Medical School and more than 30 other medical schools across the country. About 40% of all users are from outside the United States, and the materials have been translated into 28 languages. This effort has spurred a number of other educational initiatives led by medical student groups in the United States and abroad. NEXT STEPS: As understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic is constantly changing, the student authors' immediate goal is to keep the curriculum up to date in the months to come.

392639,Evaluation of Nucleocapsid and Spike Protein-Based Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assays for Detecting Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2,2020,"The emergence of more transmissible and/or more virulent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants of concern (VOC) has triggered intensive genomic surveillance, which is costly and difficult to sustain operationally over the long term. To address this problem, we developed a set of four multiplex mutation-specific PCR-based assays with same-day reporting that can detect five VOC and three variants of interest (VOI), as defined in the March 2021 guidelines from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/). The screening results were compared to the whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and showed 100% concordance for strain typing for B.1.1.7 (n = 25) and P.1 (n = 5) variants using spike (S) mutation S-N501Y, S-E484K, and S-H69-V70del assays. The S-L450R assay, designed to detect the B.1.427/429 VOC, also identified multiple isolates of a newly emerging multiply mutated B.1.526.1 variant that is now rapidly increasing in the eastern United States. PCR approaches can be easily adopted in clinical laboratories, providing rapid screening methods to allow early detection of newly emergent variants and to efficiently triage cases for full genomic sequencing.","Wang, Huanyu; Jean, Sophonie; Eltringham, Richard; Madison, John; Snyder, Pamela; Tu, Huolin; Jones, Daniel M; Leber, Amy L",J Clin Microbiol,,650

396384,Characterization of SARS-CoV-2 Genetic Material in Wastewater,2021,"AIM: The dramatic curtailment of endoscopy and CT colonography capacity during the coronavirus pandemic has adversely impacted timely diagnosis of colorectal cancer (CRC). We describe a rapidly implemented COVID-adapted diagnostic pathway to mitigate risk and maximize cancer diagnosis in patients referred with symptoms of suspected CRC. METHOD: The 'COVID-adapted pathway' integrated multiple quantitative faecal immunochemical tests (qFIT) to enrich for significant colorectal disease with judicious use of CT with oral contrast to detect gross pathology. Patients reporting 'high-risk' symptoms were triaged to qFIT+CT and the remainder underwent an initial qFIT to inform subsequent investigation. Demographic and clinical data were prospectively collected. Outcomes comprised cancer detection frequency. RESULTS: Overall, 422 patients (median age 64 years, 220 women) were triaged using this pathway. Most (84.6%) were referred as 'urgent suspicious of cancer'. Of the 422 patients, 202 (47.9%) were triaged to CT and qFIT, 211 (50.0%) to qFIT only, eight (1.9%) to outpatient clinic and one to colonoscopy. Fifteen (3.6%) declined investigation and seven (1.7%) were deemed unfit. We detected 13 cancers (3.1%), similar to the mean cancer detection rate from all referrals in 2017-2019 (3.3%). Compared with the period 1 April-31 May in 2017-2019, we observed a 43% reduction in all primary care referrals (1071 referrals expected reducing to 609). CONCLUSION: This COVID-adapted pathway mitigated the adverse effects on diagnostic capacity and detected cancer at the expected rate within those referred. However, the overall reduction in the number of referrals was substantial. The described risk-mitigating measures could be a useful adjunct whilst standard diagnostic services remain constrained due to the ongoing pandemic.","Miller, Janice; Maeda, Yasuko; Au, Stephanie; Gunn, Frances; Porteous, Lorna; Pattenden, Rebecca; MacLean, Peter; Noble, Colin L; Glancy, Stephen; Dunlop, Malcolm G; Din, Farhat V N",Colorectal dis,,650

The existential philosophy of these committees is to preserve the patients' health, maintain and promote public trust in health care providers, protect the rights of both patients and health care providers, and promote organizational ethics. However, this task can be complex and challenging during a public health emergency. Research ethics committees set the standard of research in the emergency situations through defining which research has the potential to promote the quality of response to a public health emergency. Methods: This study aims at collecting and classifying the valuable experiences of the research ethics committee members and reviewers during the early days of the COVID-19 epidemic in Iran University of Medical Sciences, one of the major universities in Tehran. It provides a basic understanding of the key concepts and challenges in reviewing and approving research by research ethics committees and the recommendations to overcome these challenging issues. Results: To accelerate the review process of COVID-19 research proposals, the scientific, methodological and ethical review panel was integrated as a large committee called 'IUMS Corona Research Team'. The first meeting was held on March 7, two weeks after the official announcement of the first case of the disease and is continued once a week. A total of 130 projects have been discussed and evaluated in this committee, among which 83 proposals were approved after modification. Conclusion: An interdisciplinary approach supports a flexible and effective scientific and ethical review of research leading to more protection of research subjects as well as promotion in the treatment and management of the pandemic ahead.","Hashemi, Akram; Bahmani, Fatemeh; Saeedi Tehrani, Saeedeh; Forouzandeh, Mina; Koohpayehzadeh, Jalil; Ashrafi, Mortaza; Khalajzadeh, Majid Reza; Motevalian, Seyed Abbas",Med J Islam Repub Iran,,650
406385,SARS-CoV-2-mediated dysregulation of metabolism and autophagy uncovers host-targeting antivirals,2021,"Most of the attention in the surveillance of evolution of SARS-CoV-2 has been centered on single nucleotide substitutions in the spike glycoprotein. We show that in-frame deletions (IFDs) also play a significant role in the evolution of viral genome. The percentage of genomes and lineages with IFDs is growing rapidly and they co-occur independently in multiple lineages, including emerging variants of concerns. IFDs distribution is correlated with spike mutations associated with immune escape and concentrated in proteins involved in interactions with the host immune system. Structural analysis suggests that IFDs remodel viral proteins surfaces at common epitopes and interaction interfaces, affecting the virus interactions with the immune system. We hypothesize that the increased frequency of IFDs is an adaptive response to elevated global population immunity. SummaryMonitoring of SARS-CoV-2 genome evolution uncovers increased frequency and non-random distribution of in-frame deletions in recently emerged lineages.","Alisoltani, Arghavan; Jaroszewski, Lukasz; Iyer, Mallika; Iranzadeh, Arash; Godzik, Adam",,,650

Hand kinematics of both prereaching and reaching movements were collected, as was electromyographic activity from the trapezius, deltoid, biceps, and triceps. Before infants first reached for toys presented at midline, they used biceps and triceps to move their hands near the toy in front of them and 45° to the side of midline. After the transition, they used trapezius and deltoid to move the hand toward the toy and combinations of multiple muscles when their arms were high and extended near the toy. Thus, infants showed a dramatic change in which muscles worked together across the transition to reaching, even though their hands moved in similar spatial regions.","Spencer, John P; Thelen, Esther",Infancy,,650

410068,The role of human selenoprotein S in SARS-CoV-2 replication,2021,"Recommending medications for patients using electronic health records (EHRs) is a crucial data mining task for an intelligent healthcare system. It can assist doctors in making clinical decisions more efficiently. However, the inherent complexity of the EHR data renders it as a challenging task: (1) Multilevel structures: the EHR data typically contains multilevel structures which are closely related with the decision-making pathways, e.g., laboratory results lead to disease diagnoses, and then contribute to the prescribed medications; (2) Multiple sequences interactions: multiple sequences in EHR data are usually closely correlated with each other; (3) Abundant noise: lots of task-unrelated features or noise information within EHR data generally result in suboptimal performance. To tackle the above challenges, we propose a multilevel selective and interactive network (MeSIN) for medication recommendation. Specifically, MeSIN is designed with three components. First, an attentional selective module (ASM) is applied to assign flexible attention scores to different medical codes embeddings by their relevance to the recommended medications in every admission. Second, we incorporate a novel interactive long-short term memory network (InLSTM) to reinforce the interactions of multilevel medical sequences in EHR data with the help of the calibrated memory-augmented cell and an enhanced input gate. Finally, we employ a global selective fusion module (GSFM) to infuse the multi-sourced information embeddings into final patient representations for medications recommendation. To validate our method, extensive experiments have been conducted on a real-world clinical dataset. The results demonstrate a consistent superiority of our framework over several baselines and testify the effectiveness of our proposed approach.","An, Yang; Zhang, Liang; You, Mao; Tian, Xueqing; Jin, Bo; Wei, Xiaopeng",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.11026v1.pdf,650

At that time, contemporary standard treatments including aspirin, statin, and even anticoagulation were not commonly used. The 2013 American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF)/American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines and the 2017 European Society of Cardiology guidelines give a class I recommendation (with the level of evidence A) for primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI) in patients with STEMI and ischemic symptoms of less than 12 h. However, if the patient presents to a hospital without pPCI capacity, and it is anticipated that pPCI cannot be performed within 120 min of first medical contact, fibrinolytic therapy is indicated (if there are no contraindications) (class I indication, level of evidence A). Our review of the pertinent literature shows that the current recommendation for inferior STEMI is based on the level of evidence lower than A. We can consider level B even C, supporting the recommendation for fibrinolytic therapy if pPCI is not available for inferior STEMI.","Birnbaum, Yochai; Levine, Glenn N; French, John; Kaski, Juan Carlos; Atar, Dan; Alam, Mahboob; Hasdai, David; Jneid, Hani; Uretsky, Barry F",Cardiovasc. drugs ther,,650

The effect of facecovers on the gaze when looking at faces has not yet been assessed. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to investigate any potential differences in eye movement pattern in observers exposed to images showing a face without and with a facecover to identify if there is truly a change of gaze when identifying (masked) facial features. METHODS: The eye movement of 64 study participants (28 males and 36 females) with a mean [standard deviation] age of 31.84 [9.0] years was analyzed in this cross-sectional observational study. Eye movement analysis was conducted based on positional changes of eye features within an x- and y-coordinate system while two images (face without/with facecover) were displayed for 8 seconds. RESULTS: The results of this study revealed that the sequence of focusing on facial regions was not altered when wearing a facecover and followed the sequence: perioral, nose, periorbital. Wearing a facecover significantly increased the time spent focusing on the periorbital region and also increased the number of repeated eye fixations during the 8-second visual stimulus presentation. No statistically significant differences were observed between male and female participants in their eye movement pattern across all investigated variables (Pâ >â 0.433). CONCLUSIONS: The altered eye movement pattern caused by wearing facecoverings that this study has revealed suggests that, during the COVID-19 pandemic, aesthetic practitioners might consider developing marketing and treatment strategies that principally target the periorbital area.","Frank, Konstantin; Schuster, Luca; Alfertshofer, Michael; Baumbach, Sebastian Felix; Herterich, Viktoria; Giunta, Riccardo E; Moellhoff, Nicholas; Braig, David; Ehrl, Denis; Cotofana, Sebastian",Aesthet Surg J,,650

424852,Aerodynamic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in two Wuhan hospitals,2020,"BACKGROUND: Many factors involved in the onset and clinical course of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic are still unknown. Although big data analytics and artificial intelligence are widely used in the realms of health and medicine, researchers are only beginning to use these tools to explore the clinical characteristics and predictive factors of patients with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: Our primary objectives are to describe the clinical characteristics and determine the factors that predict intensive care unit (ICU) admission of patients with COVID-19. Determining these factors using a well-defined population can increase our understanding of the real-world epidemiology of the disease. METHODS: We used a combination of classic epidemiological methods, natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning (for predictive modeling) to analyze the electronic health records (EHRs) of patients with COVID-19. We explored the unstructured free text in the EHRs within the Servicio de Salud de Castilla-La Mancha (SESCAM) Health Care Network (Castilla-La Mancha, Spain) from the entire population with available EHRs (1,364,924 patients) from January 1 to March 29, 2020. We extracted related clinical information regarding diagnosis, progression, and outcome for all COVID-19 cases. RESULTS: A total of 10,504 patients with a clinical or polymerase chain reaction-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were identified; 5519 (52.5%) were male, with a mean age of 58.2 years (SD 19.7). Upon admission, the most common symptoms were cough, fever, and dyspnea; however, all three symptoms occurred in fewer than half of the cases. Overall, 6.1% (83/1353) of hospitalized patients required ICU admission. Using a machine-learning, data-driven algorithm, we identified that a combination of age, fever, and tachypnea was the most parsimonious predictor of ICU admission; patients younger than 56 years, without tachypnea, and temperature <39 degrees Celsius (or >39 ºC without respiratory crackles) were not admitted to the ICU. In contrast, patients with COVID-19 aged 40 to 79 years were likely to be admitted to the ICU if they had tachypnea and delayed their visit to the emergency department after being seen in primary care. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that a combination of easily obtainable clinical variables (age, fever, and tachypnea with or without respiratory crackles) predicts whether patients with COVID-19 will require ICU admission.","Izquierdo, Jose Luis; Ancochea, Julio; Soriano, Joan B",J Med Internet Res,,650
424853,Aerodynamic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in two Wuhan hospitals,2020,"In this paper, we explore the dynamics of the return connectedness among major commodity assets (crude oil, gold and corn) and financial assets (stock, bond and currency) in China and the US during recent COVID-19 pandemic by using the time-varying connectedness measurement introduced by Antonakakis et al. (2020). Firstly, we find that the total return connectedness of the US commodity and financial assets is stronger than that of the Chinese commodity and financial assets in most cases, and both of them increase rapidly after the outbreak of COVID-19. Secondly, gold is a net transmitter of return shocks in both the Chinese and the US markets before the burst of COVID-19 pandemic, while stock and currency become net transmitters of shocks in both markets after that. Thirdly, corn usually receives the shocks from other commodity and financial assets in both China and the US markets during the COVID-19 epidemic, and the shocks it receives peak during this period, making it the strongest net receiver of shocks. Fourthly, crude oil shifts from a net transmitter to a net receiver of shocks in China after the outbreak of COVID-19, but it remains to be a net transmitter of shocks in the US. Finally, bond changes from a net receiver to a net transmitter of shocks in China after the outbreak of the epidemic, but converts from a net transmitter to a net receiver of shock in the US. The interchangeable roles of the commodity and financial assets suggest flexible regulatory and portfolio allocation strategies should be applied by policy makers and investors.","Li, Xiafei Li Bo Wei Guiwu Bai Lan Wei Yu Liang Chao",Resources Policy,,650
427297,Automobilities after SARS-CoV-2: A socio-technical perspective,2020,"The emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has prompted scientists to search for an efficient antiviral medicine to overcome the rapid spread and the marked increase in the number of patients worldwide. In this regard natural products could be a potential source of substances active against coronavirus infections. A systematic computer-aided virtual screening approach was carried out using commercially available natural products found on the Zinc Database in addition to an in-house compound library to identify potential natural product inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (MPRO). The top eighteen hits from the screening were selected for in vitro evaluation on the viral protease (SARS-CoV-2 MPRO). Five compounds (naringenin, 2,3',4,5',6-pentahydroxybenzophenone, apigenin-7-O-glucoside, sennoside B, and acetoside) displayed high activity against the viral protein. Acteoside showed similar activity to the positive control GC376. The most potent compounds were tested in vitro on SARS-CoV-2 Egyptian strain where only naringenin showed moderate anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity at non-cytotoxic micromolar concentrations in vitro with a significant selectivity index (CC50/IC50 = 178.748/28.347 = 6.3). Moreover; a common feature pharmacophore model was generated to explain the requirements for enzyme inhibition by this diverse group of active ligands. These results pave a path for future repurposing and development of natural products to aid in the battle against COVID-19.","Abdallah, Hossam M; El-Halawany, Ali M; Sirwi, Alaa; El-Araby, Amr M; Mohamed, Gamal A; Ibrahim, Sabrin R M; Koshak, Abdulrahman E; Asfour, Hani Z; Awan, Zuhier A; A Elfaky, Mahmoud",,,650
427965,Promising drug repurposing approach targeted for cytokine storm implicated in SARS-CoV-2 complications,2021,"Background: Variations in COVID-19 prevalence, severity, and mortality rate remain ambiguous. Genetic or individual differences in immune response may be an explanation. Moreover, hyperinflammation and dysregulated immune response are involved in the etiology of severe forms of COVID-19. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to analyze serum alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) levels, as an acute-phase plasma protein with immunomodulatory effect and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) as a marker of inflammation response in severe COVID-19 illness. Methods: In this retrospective observational cohort study, 64 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive COVID-19 hospitalized patients were studied for AAT, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), troponin, complete blood count (CBC), random blood sugar, serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT), and arterial oxygen saturation (O2sat) at admission and during hospitalization. Results: The results showed that hospitalized patients with COVID-19 had low serum levels of AAT and high CRP levels at the first days of hospitalization. In particular, the percentages of individuals with low, normal, and high AAT levels were 7.80%, 82.80%, and 9.40%, respectively, while high and low values of CRP accounted for 86.70% and 13.30% of patients. Most of the patients had an upward neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) trend, with a higher mortality rate (p < 0.05) and troponin levels (p < 0.05). However, comorbidities, CRP alterations, ESR alterations, nonfasting blood sugar, SGOT, SGPT, O2sat, RBC, and PLT values were not significantly different between the NLR downward and upward trend groups. Conclusions: The current study revealed that severe COVID-19 patients had low serum AAT levels related to CRP values. Therefore, AAT response may be considered as a new mechanism by which some COVID-19 patients show immune dysregulation and more severe symptoms.","Shimi, Ghazaleh; Sohrab, Golbon; Pourvali, Katayoun; Ghorbani, Arman; Balam, Farinaz Hosseini; Rostami, Khalil; Zand, Hamid",Mediators Inflamm,,650
427966,Promising drug repurposing approach targeted for cytokine storm implicated in SARS-CoV-2 complications,2021,"A considerable fraction of B cells recognize SARS-CoV-2 with germline-encoded elements of their B cell receptor resulting in the production of neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies. We found that antibody sequences from different discovery cohorts shared biochemical properties and could be retrieved across validation cohorts confirming the stereotyped character of this naive response in COVID-19. While neutralizing antibody sequences were found independently of disease severity in line with serological data, individual non-neutralizing antibody sequences were associated with fatal clinical courses suggesting detrimental effects of these antibodies. We mined 200 immune repertoires of healthy individuals and 500 of patients with blood or solid cancers - all acquired prior to the pandemic - for SARS-CoV-2 antibody sequences. While the largely unmutated B cell rearrangements occurred in a substantial fraction of immune repertoires from young and healthy individuals, these sequences were less likely found in individuals over 60 years of age and in cancer. This reflects B cell repertoire restriction in aging and cancer and may to a certain extent explain the different clinical COVID-19 courses observed in these risk groups. Future studies will have to address if this stereotyped B cell response to SARS-CoV-2 emerging from unmutated antibody rearrangements will create long-lived memory.","Paschold, Lisa; Simnica, Donjete; Willscher, Edith; Vehreschild, Maria Jgt; Dutzmann, Jochen; Sedding, Daniel G; Schultheiß, Christoph; Binder, Mascha",J. clin. invest,,650

Although nasopharyngeal swabs are the most commonly utilized samples for based severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA detection, collecting these specimens requires healthcare workers and necessitates the use of personal protective equipment as it presents a nosocomial transmission risk. We aimed to assess the diagnostic value of saliva samples in mildly symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with confirmed Covid-19. METHODS: We performed a cohort study to validate the use of saliva for SARS-CoV-2 detection in mildly symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Covid-19. Saliva samples of the patients were analyzed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: In May 2020, 28 asymptomatic and 25 mildly symptomatic patients were enrolled in the study. The median age was 37 years (range 4-70). None of the patients had a fever on presentation. Among 53 patients with SARS-CoV-2 detected in the nasopharyngeal sample, the real-time RT-PCR was positive in the saliva specimens in 48 (90.56%) patients. The mean cycle threshold (CT) values for nasopharyngeal and saliva specimens (27.80 ± 3.44 and 30.64 ± 2.83, respectively) were significantly correlated between the two sample types (p = .016). The mean CT values of nasopharyngeal and saliva samples in mildly symptomatic and asymptomatic patients (27.18 ± 3.53 and 30.24 ± 3.29 vs. 28.36 ± 3.31 and 30.98 ± 2.39, respectively) were not significantly different (p = .236 and p = .733, respectively).

Literary elements were used to portray residential care as shockingly dangerous, deceptive, and problematic. Blame was often assigned to an individual or group according to the political tendency of the newspaper. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: A cultural model of panic and dishonesty begins to take shape through the COVID-19 pandemic.

Blood glucose level is an important risk factor for the prognosis of infection and critically ill patients. We aimed to investigate the prognostic value of blood glucose level in patients with COVID-19. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We collected clinical and survival information of 2041 consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19 from two medical centers in Wuhan. Patients without available blood glucose level were excluded. We performed multivariable Cox regression to calculate HRs of blood glucose-associated indexes for the risk of progression to critical cases/mortality among non-critical cases, as well as in-hospital mortality in critical cases. Sensitivity analysis were conducted in patient without diabetes. RESULTS: Elevation of admission blood glucose level was an independent risk factor for progression to critical cases/death among non-critical cases (HR=1.30, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.63, p=0.026). Elevation of initial blood glucose level of critical diagnosis was an independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality in critical cases (HR=1.84, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.98, p=0.013). Higher median glucose level during hospital stay or after critical diagnosis (&#8805;6.1 mmol/L) was independently associated with increased risks of progression to critical cases/death among non-critical cases, as well as in-hospital mortality in critical cases. Above results were consistent in the sensitivity analysis in patients without diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Elevation of blood glucose level predicted worse outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Our findings may provide a simple and practical way to risk stratify COVID-19 inpatients for hierarchical management, particularly where medical resources are in severe shortage during the pandemic.","Wu, Jianfeng; Huang, Jianqiang; Zhu, Guochao; Wang, Qiongya; Lv, Qingquan; Huang, Ying; Yu, Yang; Si, Xiang; Yi, Hui; Wang, Cuiping; Liu, Yihao; Xiao, Han; Zhou, Qian; Liu, Xin; Yang, Daya; Guan, Xiangdong; Li, Yanbing; Peng, Sui; Sung, Joseph; Xiao, Haipeng",,,650

441249,Minireview of progress in the structural study of SARS-CoV-2 proteins,2020,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review considers the potential and demonstrated impacts of SARS-CoV-2 on the sexually transmissible infection (STI)/HIV transmission. RECENT FINDINGS: COVID-19 increases the vulnerability of those at highest risk of acquiring STI/HIV. Altered health-seeking behaviour, reductions in STI/HIV clinic capacity, service disruptions and redeployment of human resources to assist COVID-19 control efforts have impacted on STI/HIV control programmes. Reports of reduced STI incidence are emerging, but it is hard to determine whether this is real or due to decreased testing during COVID-19 lockdown periods. Fear of COVID-19 and implemented control measures have altered STI/HIV transmission dynamics. Sexual health services adapted to the pandemic by reducing face-to-face patient encounters in favour of telehealth and mail-based initiatives as well as more stringent triage practice. Many sexual health and HIV treatment services now operate at reduced capacity and experience ongoing service disruptions, which necessarily translates into poorer outcomes for patients and their communities. SUMMARY: In the short-term, COVID-19 related sexual behaviour change is driving STI/HIV transmission downwards. However, the impacts of the global COVID-19 response on sexual health-seeking behaviour and STI/HIV services threaten to drive STI/HIV transmission upwards.

445025,Molecular architecture of SARS-CoV-2 envelope by integrative modeling,2021,"In order to investigate the effectiveness of lockdown and social distancing restrictions, which have been widely carried out as policy choice to curb the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic around the world, we formulate and discuss a staged and weighed networked system based on a classical SEAIR epidemiological model. Five stages have been taken into consideration according to four-tier response to Public Health Crisis, which comes from the National Contingency Plan in China. Staggered basic reproduction number has been derived and we evaluate the effectiveness of lockdown and social distancing policies under different scenarios among 19 cities/regions in mainland China. Further, we estimate the infection risk associated with the sequential release based on population mobility between cities and the intensity of some non-pharmaceutical interventions. Our results reveal that Level I public health emergency response is necessary for high-risk cities, which can flatten the COVID-19 curve effectively and quickly. Moreover, properly designed staggered-release policies are extremely significant for the prevention and control of COVID-19, furthermore, beneficial to economic activities and social stability and development.","Ge, Jing; He, Daihai; Lin, Zhigui; Zhu, Huaiping; Zhuang, Zian",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.08152v1.pdf,650

Conventional mechanical ventilation strategies using high levels of PEEP may not be beneficial and can even be harmful to patient with ARDS from COVID-19. So the ventilation strategies should be adjusted in order to improve the pulmonary ventilation function and oxygenation status, and outcomes of the patient. PATIENT CONCERNS: Herein, we present a 76-year-old male patient with ARDS secondary to COVID-19. We describe our experience with mechanical ventilation strategy and the changes in respiratory mechanics in the patient during treatment. DIAGNOSIS: The patient had tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) in nucleic acid test. Chest CT showed multiple ground glass shadows in both lungs. INTERVENTIONS: The patient received mechanical ventilation with low tidal volume and low PEEP. OUTCOMES: After treatment, the patients condition, as well as oxygenation status was improved, and he tested negative for the coronavirus several times. CONCLUSION: This case demonstrated that the low tidal volume with low levels of PEEP ventilation strategy may be more suitable for ARDS from COVID-19.","Guo, Wei-Guang; Fang, Bin; Xian, Yan-Shan; Yu, Zhi-Hui; Zhou, Li-Xin",Medicine (Baltimore),,650
446076,In Silico Study of Mutational Stability of SARS-CoV-2 Proteins,2021,"Physical contacts result in the spread of various phenomena such as viruses, gossips, ideas, packages and marketing pamphlets across a population. The spread depends on how people move and co-locate with each other, or their mobility patterns. How far such phenomena spread has significance for both policy making and personal decision making, e.g., studying the spread of COVID-19 under different intervention strategies such as wearing a mask. In practice, mobility patterns of an entire population is never available, and we usually have access to location data of a subset of individuals. In this paper, we formalize and study the problem of estimating the spread of a phenomena in a population, given that we only have access to sub-samples of location visits of some individuals in the population. We show that simple solutions such as estimating the spread in the sub-sample and scaling it to the population, or more sophisticated solutions that rely on modeling location visits of individuals do not perform well in practice, the former because it ignores contacts between unobserved individuals and sampled ones and the latter because it yields inaccurate modeling of co-locations. Instead, we directly model the co-locations between the individuals. We introduce PollSpreader and PollSusceptible, two novel approaches that model the co-locations between individuals using a contact network, and infer the properties of the contact network using the subsample to estimate the spread of the phenomena in the entire population. We show that our estimates provide an upper bound and a lower bound on the spread of the disease in expectation. Finally, using a large high-resolution real-world mobility dataset, we experimentally show that our estimates are accurate, while other methods that do not correctly account for co-locations between individuals result in wrong observations (e.g, premature herd-immunity).","Zeighami, Sepanta; Shahabi, Cyrus; Krumm, John",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.06987v1.pdf,650

As input data, we used COVID-19 epidemiological information collected in fifteen European countries either in private surveys or using official statistics. Thirteen countries implemented lockdown measures, two countries (Sweden, Iceland) not. As output parameters, we studied herd immunity level and time of formation. Comparison of these parameters was used as an indicator of effectiveness / ineffectiveness of lockdown measures. In the absence of a medical vaccine, herd immunity may be regarded as a factor of population adaptation to severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2, the viral pathogen causing COVID-19 disease (SARS-CoV-2), and hence COVID-19 spreading stop. We demonstrated that there is no significant difference between lockdown and no-lockdown modes of COVID-19 containment, in terms of both herd immunity level and the time of achieving its maximum. The rationale for personal and business lockdowns may be found in the avoidance of healthcare system overburdening. However, lockdowns do not prevent any virus with droplet transmission (including SARS-CoV-2) from spreading. Therefore, in case of a future viral pathogen emergence, lockdown measures efficiency should not be overestimated, as it was done almost universally in the world during COVID-19 pandemic.","Sharov, Konstantin S",Chaos Solitons Fractals,,650

449679,Stability of SARS-CoV-2 phylogenies,2020,"Autophagy acts as a cellular surveillance mechanism to combat invading pathogens. Viruses have evolved various strategies to block autophagy and even subvert it for their replication and release. Here, we demonstrated that ORF3a of the COVID-19 virus SARS-CoV-2 inhibits autophagy activity by blocking fusion of autophagosomes/amphisomes with lysosomes. The late endosome-localized ORF3a directly interacts with and sequestrates the homotypic fusion and protein sorting (HOPS) component VPS39, thereby preventing HOPS complex from interacting with the autophagosomal SNARE protein STX17. This blocks assembly of the STX17-SNAP29-VAMP8 SNARE complex, which mediates autophagosome/amphisome fusion with lysosomes. Expression of ORF3a also damages lysosomes and impairs their function. SARS-CoV-2 virus infection blocks autophagy, resulting in accumulation of autophagosomes/amphisomes, and causes late endosomal sequestration of VPS39. Surprisingly, ORF3a from the SARS virus SARS-CoV fails to interact with HOPS or block autophagy. Our study reveals a mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 evades lysosomal destruction and provides insights for developing new strategies to treat COVID-19.","Miao, Guangyan; Zhao, Hongyu; Li, Yan; Ji, Mingming; Chen, Yong; Shi, Yi; Bi, Yuhai; Wang, Peihui; Zhang, Hong",Dev. cell,,650

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether practice of urologists is in line with guidelines for the management of common urological conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic produced by leading (inter)national urological associations. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Self-selected urologists completed a voluntary survey available online from March 27 to April 11, 2020 and distributed globally by the Société Internationale d'Urologie. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Responses to two survey questions on the (1) management of 14 common urological procedures and (2) priority scoring of 10 common urological procedures were evaluated by practice setting and geographical region using chi-square and one-way analysis of variance analyses, respectively. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: There were 2494 respondents from 76 countries. Oncological conditions were prioritised over benign conditions, and benign conditions were deferred when feasible and safe. Oncological conditions with the greatest malignant potential were prioritised over less aggressive cancers. Respondents from Europe were least likely to postpone and most likely to prioritise conditions identified by guidelines as being of the highest priority. Respondents' priority scoring of urological procedures closely matched the priorities assigned by guidelines. The main limitation of this study is that respondents were self-selected, and access to the survey was limited by language and technology barriers. CONCLUSIONS: Prioritisation and management of urological procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic are in line with current guidelines. The greatest agreement was reported in Europe. Observed differences may be related to limited resources in some settings.

451027,NOVEL SARS-CoV-2 INHIBITORS FROM PHENETHYLTHIAZOLETHIOUREA DERIVATIVES USING HYBRID QSAR MODELS AND DOCKING SIMULATION,2021,"BACKGROUND: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing, self-quarantining, wearing masks and washing hands have become part of the new norm for many, but not all. It appears that such preventive measures are critical to ""flattening the curve"" of the spread of the Coronavirus. The public's adoption of such behaviors, barring an effective vaccine or cure, is an essential component in the battle against what has been referred to as the ""invisible enemy"". OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of the present study was to develop a model for predicting COVID-19 among US college students. The Health Belief Model (HBM) has a long history of use and empirical support in predicting preventive health behaviors but is not without its purported shortcomings. The present study identifies a more optimal, and defensible, combination of variables to explain preventive behaviors among college students. This segment of the US population is critical in helping slow the spread of the Coronavirus because of its relative reluctance to perform the needed behaviors given they do not feel susceptible or fearful of the COVID-19 disease. METHODS: A sample of 415 US college students were surveyed via Qualtrics and asked to answer questions regarding their fear of COVID-19, information receptivity (seeking relevant information), perceived knowledge of the disease, self-efficacy, and performance of preventive behaviors. The PROCESS Model 6 was used to test our conceptual model including predictions involving sequential mediation. RESULTS: Sequential mediation results show that fear of COVID-19 leads individuals to seek out information regarding the disease, which increases their perceived knowledge and fosters self-efficacy which is key to driving preventive behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Self-imposed preventive measures can drastically impact the rate of infection among populations. Based upon the study's newly created sequential mediation model, communication strategies for encouraging COVID-19 preventive behaviors are offered. It is clear that college students, and very possibly adults of all ages, must have a healthy fear of COVID-19 to set in motion a process where concerned individuals seek COVID-19 related information, increasing their store of knowledge concerning the disease, enhancing their self-efficacy and ultimately their likelihood of performing the needed preventive behaviors.","Roberts, James; David, Meredith E",J. med. internet res,,650

Mice immunized with RBD nanoparticles, but not soluble antigen, elicited cross-reactive binding and neutralization responses. Mosaic RBD nanoparticles elicited antibodies with superior cross-reactive recognition of heterologous RBDs relative to sera from immunizations with homotypic SARS-CoV-2-RBD nanoparticles or COVID-19 convalescent human plasmas. Moreover, after priming, sera from mosaic RBD-immunized mice neutralized heterologous pseudotyped coronaviruses as well as or better than sera from homotypic SARS-CoV-2-RBD nanoparticle immunizations, demonstrating no loss of immunogenicity against particular RBDs resulting from co-display.

High mortality rates of the COVID-19 have overwhelmed the resuscitation services. The constant fear of virus infection during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) has placed severe restrictions on the resuscitation services. Reports of poor outcomes after CPR further dampened the spirits of CPR providers. Hence we surveyed CPR practices for COVID-19 patients across hospitals in India by health care providers. Material and Methods: An online survey using Google Forms was initiated to collect data on performance of CPR in diagnosed cases of COVID-19 after in-hospital cardiac arrest. The survey's web-link was publicized using social media, and participation sought of all personnel involved in CPR delivery in COVID-19 patients. The responses received were analyzed. The main outcome measured were determination of the percentage of COVID-19 patients discharged home who were administered CPR. Results: There were 248 responses from different parts of India. At the time of cardiac arrest, 194 victims had diffuse lung infiltrates, 22 had mild lung disease, while 32 had no documented lung lesion. Twenty-five victims had evidence of pulmonary embolism, 39 had cardiac involvement, and 3 had brain involvement. Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was achieved in 59.27% of cases but ROSC sustained in only 22.59%. 7.25% of patients, who received CPR, could be discharged home. Conclusion: The survey has shown reasonable survival rates after CPR administration in COVID-19 patients suffering from IHCA.

CONCLUSION: Conclusions: The course of the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the health care system and, therefore, also on the availability of medical care among oncologicalpatients. The results signal an emerging problem. These visit shifts may negatively affect the outcome of cancer treatment. The potential risk of COVID-19 infection should beindividually balanced against cancer treatment delay in each patient. The ongoing pandemic, therefore, prompts a careful analysis of the effects of deferring cancer therapy.","Koscielecka, K. E.; Kuc, A. J.; Kubik, D.

Here we use state-of-the-art deep neural networks over an institution-wide machine intelligence platform for the augmented curation of 15.8 million clinical notes from 30,494 patients subjected to COVID-19 PCR diagnostic testing. By contrasting the Electronic Health Record (EHR)-derived clinical phenotypes of COVID-19-positive (COVIDpos, n=635) versus COVID-19-negative (COVIDneg, n=29,859) patients over each day of the week preceding the PCR testing date, we identify anosmia/dysgeusia (37.4-fold), myalgia/arthralgia (2.6-fold), diarrhea (2.2-fold), fever/chills (2.1-fold), respiratory difficulty (1.9-fold), and cough (1.8-fold) as significantly amplified in COVIDpos over COVIDneg patients. The specific combination of cough and diarrhea has a 3.2-fold amplification in COVIDpos patients during the week prior to PCR testing, and along with anosmia/dysgeusia, constitutes the earliest EHR-derived signature of COVID-19 (4-7 days prior to typical PCR testing date). This study introduces an Augmented Intelligence platform for the real-time synthesis of institutional knowledge captured in EHRs.

Children have their own specific clinical features; notably, they seem to be escaping the severe respiratory adverse effects. The international scientific community is rapidly carrying out studies, driving to the need to reassess knowledge of the disease and therapeutic strategies. AIM: To assess the characteristics of COVID-19 infected children worldwide of all ages, from neonates to children and adolescents, and how they differ from their adult counterparts. SEARCH STRATEGY: An electronic search in PubMed was conducted, using combinations of the following keywords: coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, children. The search included all types of articles written in English between January 1, 2019 until August 15, 2020. RESULTS: The search identified 266 relevant articles. Children were mainly within family clusters of cases and have relatively milder clinical presentation compared with adults; children were reported to have better outcomes with a significantly lower mortality rate. Cough and fever were the most common symptoms while pneumonia was the cardinal respiratory manifestation of infected children. Laboratory results and thoracic imaging give varying results. CONCLUSIONS: Children were mainly family cluster cases and usually presented with a mild infection, although cases presented with the multisystem inflammatory syndrome are becoming more apparent. Studies determining why the manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection are so variable may help to gain a better understanding of the disease and accelerate the development of vaccines and therapies.","Perikleous, Evanthia; Tsalkidis, Aggelos; Bush, Andrew; Paraskakis, Emmanouil",Pediatr Pulmonol,,650

METHODS: An analytical case-control study was performed comparing stillbirths from March to September 2020 (cases) and March to September 2019 (controls) in a tertiary care center in India. Modifiable factors were observed as level-I, level-II, and level-III delays. RESULTS: A significant difference in the rate of stillbirths was found among cases (37.4/1000) and controls (29.9/1000) (P = 0.045). Abruption in normotensive women was significantly higher in cases compared to controls (P = 0.03). Modifiable factors or preventable causes were noted in 76.1% of cases and 59.6% of controls; the difference was highly significant (P < 0.001, relative risk [RR] 1.8). Level-II delays or delays in reaching the hospital for delivery due to lack of transport were observed in 12.7% of cases compared to none in controls (P < 0.006, RR 47.7). Level-III delays or delays in providing care at the facility were observed in 31.3% of cases and 11.5% of controls (P < 0.001, RR 2.7).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A combined prospective and retrospective, multicentre, cohort study was conducted at 10 sites in Austria in 247 people with diabetes or newly diagnosed prediabetes who were hospitalized with COVID-19. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality and the predictor variables upon admission included clinical data, co-morbidities of diabetes or laboratory data. Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify significant predictors and to develop a risk score for in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: The mean age of people hospitalized (n = 238) for COVID-19 was 71.1 ± 12.9 years, 63.6% were males, 75.6% had type 2 diabetes, 4.6% had type 1 diabetes and 19.8% had prediabetes. The mean duration of hospital stay was 18 ± 16 days, 23.9% required ventilation therapy and 24.4% died in the hospital. The mortality rate in people with diabetes was numerically higher (26.7%) compared with those with prediabetes (14.9%) but without statistical significance (P = .128). A score including age, arterial occlusive disease, C-reactive protein, estimated glomerular filtration rate and aspartate aminotransferase levels at admission predicted in-hospital mortality with a C-statistic of 0.889 (95% CI: 0.837-0.941) and calibration of 1.000 (P = .909).

The aim of the present study was to investigate the buffering role of personal resilience in two aspects of psychological functioning, mental health and stress, among Slovene adults at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak. Within five days after Slovenia declared epidemics, 2722 participants (75% female) completed an on-line survey measuring mental health and perceived stress as outcome variables and demographics, health-related variables, and personal resilience as predictor variables. Hierarchical logistic regression analyses demonstrated that women, younger, and less educated participants had higher odds for less favourable psychological functioning during the COVID-19 outbreak. In addition, poorer health indicators and COVID-19 infection concerns predicted diminished psychological functioning. The crucial factor promoting good psychological functioning during the COVID-19 pandemics was resilience, additionally buffering against detrimental effects of demographic and health-related variables on mental health and perceived stress. While previous research suggests that mental health problems increase during pandemics, one way to prevent these problems and bolster psychological functioning is to build individuals' resilience. The interventions should be targeted particularly at younger adults, women, less educated people, and individuals who subjectively perceive their health to be rather poor.","Kavcic, Tina; Avsec, Andreja; Zager Kocjan, Gaja",Psychiatr. q,,650
461430,Identification of Epidemiological Traits by Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Sequences,2021,"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in 2019 has caused a major health and economic crisis around the globe. Gaining knowledge about its attributes and interactions with human host cells is crucial. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are involved in the host cells' innate antiviral immune response. In RNA interference, microRNAs (miRNAs) may bind to complementary sequences of the viral RNA strand, forming an miRNA-induced silencing complex, which destroys the viral RNA, thereby inhibiting viral protein expression. There are several targets for human miRNAs on SARS-CoV-2's RNA, most of which are in the 5' and 3' untranslated regions. Mutations of the viral genome causing the creation or loss of miRNA binding sites may have crucial effects on SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity. In addition to mediating immunity, the ncRNA landscape of host cells further influences their susceptibility to virus infection, as certain miRNAs are essential in the regulation of cellular receptors that are necessary for virus invasion. Conversely, virus infection also changes the host ncRNA expression patterns, possibly augmenting conditions for viral replication and dissemination. Hence, ncRNAs typically upregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infection could be useful biomarkers for disease progression and severity. Understanding these mechanisms could provide further insight into the pathogenesis and possible treatment options against COVID-19.","Henzinger, Hanna; Barth, Dominik A; Klec, Christiane; Pichler, Martin",Viruses,,650

Existing assays that directly measure this activity are limited mainly to measurements of up to two specificities in a single reaction. Here, we develop a multiplex cytotoxicity assay that allows direct, simultaneous measurement of up to 23 different specificities of CD8+ T cells in a single reaction. This can greatly reduce the amount of starting clinical materials for a systematic screening of CD8+ T cell epitopes. In addition, this greatly enhanced capacity enables the incorporation of irrelevant epitopes for determining the non-specific killing activity of CD8+ T cells, thereby allowing to measure the actual epitope-specific cytotoxicity activities. This technique is shown to be useful to study both human and mouse CD8+ T cells. Besides, our results from human PBMCs and three independent infectious animal models (MERS, influenza and malaria) further reveal that IFNÎ³ expression by epitope-specific CD8+ T cells does not always correlate with their cell-killing potential, highlighting the need for using cytotoxicity assays in specific contexts (e.g., evaluating vaccine candidates). Overall, our approach opens up new possibilities for comprehensive analyses of CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity in a practical manner.","Poh, Chek Meng; Zheng, Jian; Channappanavar, Rudragouda; Chang, Zi Wei; Nguyen, Thi H O; Rénia, Laurent; Kedzierska, Katherine; Perlman, Stanley; Poon, Leo L M",Front Immunol,,650

Both are now even more critically socially constructed. In the middle of battle with the COVID-19 pandemic, the Republic of Croatia's capital of Zagreb was afflicted with another disaster - two severe earthquakes. Restrictive public health measures were already in place, including restriction on public transport, travel between regions, closure of educational and other public institutions, alongside measures of physical distancing. Most previous cases of COVID-19 were centered in Zagreb, leading to concern of spreading the disease into disease-free communities. It seems that earthquakes did not have an effect on disease transmission - the number of COVID-19 cases remained stable through the 14-day incubation period, with a linear pandemic curve in Croatia in April, and flattened in May. This leads to a conclusion that the earthquake did not have a direct effect on disease spread. Despite the fact that the current pandemic and its responses are unique, this paradox can have interesting repercussions on how we conceptualize and approach notions as vulnerability and resilience.","Curkovic, M; Svetina, L; Kosec, A",Spat Spatiotemporal Epidemiol,,650

We assessed the impact of social distancing caused by this extreme weather event on the transmission of respiratory viruses. METHODS: Residual specimens from patients evaluated for acute respiratory illness at hospitals in the Seattle metropolitan area were screened for a panel of respiratory viruses. Transmission models were fit to each virus to estimate the magnitude reduction in transmission due to weather-related disruptions. Changes in contact rates and care-seeking were informed by data on local traffic volumes and hospital visits. RESULTS: Disruption in contact patterns reduced effective contact rates during the intervention period by 16 to 95%, and cumulative disease incidence through the remainder of the season by 3 to 9%. Incidence reductions were greatest for viruses that were peaking when the disruption occurred and least for viruses in an early epidemic phase. CONCLUSION: High-intensity, short-duration social distancing measures may substantially reduce total incidence in a respiratory virus epidemic if implemented near the epidemic peak. For SARS-CoV-2, this suggests that, even when SARS-CoV-2 spread is out of control, implementing short-term disruptions can prevent COVID-19 deaths.","Jackson, Michael L; Hart, Gregory R; McCulloch, Denise J; Adler, Amanda; Brandstetter, Elisabeth; Fay, Kairsten; Han, Peter; Lacombe, Kirsten; Lee, Jover; Sibley, Thomas R; Nickerson, Deborah A; Rieder, Mark J; Starita, Lea; Englund, Janet A; Bedford, Trevor; Chu, Helen; Famulare, Michael",BMC Infect Dis,,650
466093,SARS-CoV-2 Molecular Network Structure,2020,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19 is a disease characterized by a range of clinical syndromes including variable degrees of respiratory symptoms from mild respiratory illness and severe interstitial pneumonia to acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, coagulopathies, and multiorgan dysfunction. This virus carries the potential to manifest in a wide range of pulmonary findings and hypoxemias, from mild respiratory symptoms to more severe syndromes, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome. The rapid accumulation of evidence and persistent gaps in knowledge related to the virus presents a host of challenges for clinicians. This creates a complex environment for clinical decision-making. OBJECTIVE: To examine oxygenation strategies in critically ill patients with hypoxia who are hospitalized with COVID-19. DISCUSSION: These proposed strategies may help to improve the respiratory status and oxygenation of those affected by COVID-19. However, additional high-quality research is needed to provide further evidence for improved respiratory management strategies. Areas of future research should focus on improving understanding of the inflammatory and clotting processes associated with the virus, particularly in the lungs. High-level evidence and randomized controlled trials should target the most effective strategies for improving oxygenation, time requiring mechanical ventilation, and survival for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 presenting with hypoxemia.","Evers, Julianne M; Pehlke, Sarah J; Jones, Lauren L; Urquhart, Michelle G",Dimens Crit Care Nurs,,650
467387,Viewpoint: Origin of SARS-CoV-2,2020,"Finding a link between COVID-19 and subsequent psychiatric symptoms has resulted in renewed interest in the psychiatric sequelae of pandemics. The first such instance was apparently the encephalitis lethargica pandemic which arose around the time of the First World War, moving in the shadow of a repiratory virus pandemic. The epidemic of encephalitis lethargica (EL), or Von Economo's Disease, in the years 1917-27 was the first pandemic involving the central nervous system. It moved in some places in parallel with the Great Flu Pandemic but does not seem to have been caused by it. Unlike the coronavirus, pandemic EL affected children heavily, leading often to bizarre changes in character and personality. It often left sequelae lasting for decades in the form of postencephalitic Parkinsonism (PEP). Unlike the coronavirus, it had a high mortality of around 20 percent. Although encephalitis lethargica involved a number of systems, psychiatric morbidity was most prominent and entailed severe depression, mania, catatonia and psychosis. It ended without therapeutic or public-health measures; today, sporadic cases of EL continue to be reported. The hypothesis is that we can derive from the EL psychiatric pandemic certain lessons that might be useful in studying tardive COVID symptoms today.","Shorter, Edward",Med Hypotheses,,650

The purpose of this article was to explore the potential impact of COVID-19 on loneliness and well-being. Social support is an important consideration for understanding the impact of COVID-19 Psychological First Aid and Skills for Psychological Recovery, which are tools used to inform response methods to help people connect during isolation and are interventions that could be adapted to COVID-specific needs for what may be a prolonged isolation and postisolation. Given the many unknowns of COVID-19, studies are needed to understand the larger behavioral health impact to ensure resources are available, current, and evidence informed. Future studies are also needed to understand how access to technology may help buffer loneliness and isolation and thus improve the social outcomes of the current pandemic.

OBJECTIVE: To provide estimates of mental health indicators and stressors for US adults by disability status during April and May 2020, shortly following the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We analyzed data from Porter Novelli View 360 opt-in Internet panel survey conducted during the weeks of April 20th and May 18th, 2020 among 1004 English-speaking adults aged &#8805;18 years without and with disabilities (serious difficulty with hearing, vision, cognition, or mobility; any difficulty with self-care or independent living). Weighted logistic regression was used to test for significant differences between calculated prevalence estimates at the P &#8804; .05 level. RESULTS: One in four adults reported any disability. Adults with any disability were significantly more likely than adults without disability to report current depressive symptoms, frequent mental distress, suicidal ideation, and COVID-19-related initiated or increased substance use (all p values < .0001). Adults with disabilities also reported significantly higher levels of stressors, such as access to health care services (p < .0001), difficulty caring for their own (or another's) chronic condition (p < .0001), emotional or physical abuse from others (p < .001), and not having enough food (p < .01). CONCLUSIONS: The disproportionately high levels of poor mental health indicators among adults with disabilities as compared to those without highlight the importance of delivering timely mental health screening and treatment/intervention during and after the COVID-19 pandemic to persons with disabilities.","Okoro, Catherine A; Strine, Tara W; McKnight-Eily, Lela; Verlenden, Jorge; Hollis, NaTasha D",Disabil Health J,,650

The present study examines the perceptions of teachers and school psychologists regarding the roles of school psychologists on the island of Crete, Greece. For this purpose, an online questionnaire about the current and preferred roles of the school psychologist was distributed. Two hundred and seventy-nine (279) teachers and fifty-seven (57) school psychologists participated in this research study. The analysis and comparison of the participants' responses revealed significant differences in their beliefs about the current and preferred roles of the psychologist. Emphasis was placed by psychologists on systematic interventions such as consultation and by teachers on counseling for their personal problems. Overall, respondents in this study recognized the usefulness of the school psychologist in the educational sector. A unified framework of reference for the range of the schools' psychological services would enhance common understanding and facilitate the professional role of school psychologists and effective student referral to the related professional services.","Panteri, Maria Calmaestra Juan Marín-Díaz Verónica",Education Sciences,,650

Health sciences university students may have been particularly affected with this change due to a lack of practical education. It is not known how health sciences students and schools have adjusted to exclusive e-learning. This study aimed to explore attitudes and concerns of health sciences students in Croatia regarding the complete switch to e-learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Eligible participants were students from 9 institutions offering university-level health sciences education in Croatia enrolled in the academic year 2019/2010, and participating in e-learning. Data were collected with a questionnaire distributed via email during April/May 2020. RESULTS: A total of 2520 students (aged 25.7 ± 7.7 years) responded to the questionnaire (70.3% response rate). General satisfaction with exclusive e-learning was rated with average grade of 3.7 out of 5. Compared with previous education, exclusive e-learning was rated with average grade of 3.2 out of 5. Compared to classroom learning, equal or higher motivation to attend exclusive e-learning was reported by 64.4% of participants. With a longer duration of exclusive e-learning, equal or higher motivation was reported by 65.5% of participants. Less than half of the students indicated they felt deprived or concerned due to the lack of practical lessons. Most participants indicated that in the future, they would prefer to combine classic classroom and e-learning (N = 1403; 55.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Most health sciences students were satisfied with the exclusive e-learning, as well as their personal and institutional adjustment to it. Students' feedback can help institutions to improve the exclusive e-learning experience for students in the time of the pandemic.","Puljak, Livia; Civljak, Marta; Haramina, Ana; Malisa, Snjezana; Cavic, Dalibor; Klinec, Dinko; Aranza, Diana; Mesaric, Jasna; Skitarelic, Natasa; Zoranic, Sanja; Majstorovic, Dijana; Neuberg, Marijana; Miksic, Stefica; Ivanisevic, Kata",BMC Med Educ,,650

The present report is of a case of hyponatremia and encephalopathy due to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) as the main presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a 55-year-old woman. CASE REPORT A 55-year-old woman with type II diabetes mellitus presented with confusion and slurring of speech, with a temperature of 38.5°C, heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure of 159/81 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. She did not have edema on examination. Laboratory testing showed a low sodium level of 116 mEq/L (reference range, 135-145 mEq/L) with urine osmolarity of 364 mOsm/kg, urinary sodium of 69 mEq/L, urinary potassium of 15.6 mEq/L, and serum osmolarity of 251 mOsm/kg. The patient had normal serum thyroid-stimulating hormone and cortisol levels. A chest X-ray should no pulmonary infiltrates nor did a lumbar puncture reveal signs of infection. A real-time SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction assay was positive for COVID-19. Brain imaging with computed tomography was negative for acute infarct, intracranial hemorrhage, and mass effect. Based on findings from laboratory testing and physical examination, a diagnosis of SIADH was made. The patient was treated with 3% hypertonic saline, followed by salt tablets and fluid restriction, with improvement in her clinical symptoms and serum sodium level. CONCLUSIONS The present report is of a rare but previously reported association with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Encephalopathy and hyponatremia associated with SIADH without pneumonia or other symptoms of infection should be an indication for testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Sherazi, Andleeb; Bedi, Puneet; Udevbulu, Ehizode; Rubin, Vadim; Alasadi, Lutfi; Spitalewitz, Samuel",Am J Case Rep,,650

For example, it can lead to psychological and/or psychiatric disorders in some people. Numerous researches are highlighting the similarities of these addictions with the consumption of toxic substances. University students are heavy users of the Internet and, in certain situations, addiction to online social networks can be the result of depression, harassment, and anxiety, among others, affecting their daily life, including their academic responsibilities. In recent months, an anomaly has occurred that may have contributed to intensifying this problem, namely the confinement produced by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has affected the whole world to a greater or lesser extent. In this cross-sectional study, with a descriptive and quantitative methodology, students from 14 Spanish universities were investigated in the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in order to understand the effects of this situation on the problem described. The results show a high consumption of social networks during that time, with significant incidences of addiction. In parallel, the presence of comorbidity has been determined. In this scenario, it would be necessary to implement university educational programs to redirect these addictive behaviors, as well as preventative recommendations and actions to minimize negative impacts. This is a major problem that is growing, exacerbated by the global pandemic produced by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.

METHODS: The plasma samples were obtained from 112 sepsis patients within 24 hours after admission and 100 healthy controls (HCs) at enrollment. The lncRNA MEG3 expression in plasma samples was determined by RT-qPCR. In sepsis patients, ARDS occurrence was assessed based on Berlin definition of ARDS and 28-day mortality risk was evaluated. RESULTS: LncRNA MEG3 expression was increased in sepsis patients compared with HCs. During 28-day duration, 30 sepsis patients occurred ARDS and 82 sepsis patients did not occur ARDS. LncRNA MEG3 expression was elevated in ARDS sepsis patients compared with non-ARDS sepsis patients, then the following receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis disclosed that lncRNA MEG3 predicted ARDS risk (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.775), which was further validated as an independent risk factor by multivariate logistic regression. Furthermore, lncRNA MEG3 was positively correlated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, respiratory infection, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score, sequential organ failure assessment score, white blood cell, and C-reactive protein, while negatively correlated with albumin in sepsis patients. Additionally, lncRNA MEG3 was elevated in 28-day deaths compared with 28-day survivors, and it predicted 28-day mortality risk in sepsis patients (AUC = 0.708) by ROC curve analysis. CONCLUSION: LncRNA MEG3 might represent as a valuable biomarker for individualizing prevention strategies against ARDS and improving prognosis in sepsis.","Wu, Xiaoling; Chen, Dan; Yu, Li",J Clin Lab Anal,,650

Así el objetivo de esta investigación fue explorar la relación de las medidas de mecánica ventilatoria y radiográficas con el tiempo de conexión a VM en pacientes COVID-19. Estudio retrospectivo, que incluyó a 23 pacientes en VM. Se recolectó información de variables de mecánica ventilatoria; PEEP, presión plateau, presión de distensión y compliance estática. Desde la RT se midió, altura y ancho pulmonar, ángulo costodiafragmático y espacio intercostal. Los resultados indicaron que las variables de mecánica ventilatoria tales como el PEEP y el plateau se relacionaron significativamente con el tiempo de conexión a VM (r=0,449; p=0,035 y r=0,472; p=0,026), mientras que las variables radiográficas construidas en base al ángulo costodiafragmático y el espacio intercostal presentaron similares comportamientos (r= 0,462; p=0,046 y r=-0,543; p=0,009). En conclusión, la presión resultante de la programación del ventilador mecánico junto a cambios estructurales observados en la RT, se relacionan con el tiempo de conexión a VM.","Muñoz-Cofré, Rodrigo; Araneda-Madrid, Patricio; del Sol, Mariano; Álvarez-Pérez, Felipe; Pérez-Riquelme, Camilo; Escobar-Cabello, Máximo; Valenzuela-Vásquez, Jorge",Int. j. morphol,,650

Elevated serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of systemic inflammation, are associated with severe disease in bacterial or viral infections. We aimed to explore associations between CRP concentration at initial hospital presentation and clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19. METHODS AND RESULTS: Consecutive adults aged &#8805;18 years with COVID-19 admitted to a large New York healthcare system between 1 March and 8 April 2020 were identified. Patients with measurement of CRP were included. Venous thrombo-embolism (VTE), acute kidney injury (AKI), critical illness, and in-hospital mortality were determined for all patients. Among 2782 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, 2601 (93.5%) had a CRP measurement [median 108 mg/L, interquartile range (IQR) 53-169]. CRP concentrations above the median value were associated with VTE [8.3% vs. 3.4%; adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.61-3.36], AKI (43.0% vs. 28.4%; aOR 2.11, 95% CI 1.76-2.52), critical illness (47.6% vs. 25.9%; aOR 2.83, 95% CI 2.37-3.37), and mortality (32.2% vs. 17.8%; aOR 2.59, 95% CI 2.11-3.18), compared with CRP below the median. A dose response was observed between CRP concentration and adverse outcomes. While the associations between CRP and adverse outcomes were consistent among patients with low and high D-dimer levels, patients with high D-dimer and high CRP have the greatest risk of adverse outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Systemic inflammation, as measured by CRP, is strongly associated with VTE, AKI, critical illness, and mortality in COVID-19. CRP-based approaches to risk stratification and treatment should be tested.","Smilowitz, Nathaniel R; Kunichoff, Dennis; Garshick, Michael; Shah, Binita; Pillinger, Michael; Hochman, Judith S; Berger, Jeffrey S",Eur. heart j,,650

MAIN BODY: The activation of alveolar cells and alveolar macrophages leads to the release of large quantities of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and their translocation into the pulmonary vasculature. The presence of these inflammatory mediators in the vascular compartment leads to the activation of vascular endothelial cells platelets and neutrophils and the subsequent formation of platelet neutrophil complexes. These complexes in concert with activated endothelial cells interact to create a state of immunothrombosis. The consequence of immunothrombosis include hypercoagulation, accelerating inflammation, fibrin deposition, migration of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) producing neutrophils into the alveolar apace, activation of the NLRP3 inflammazome, increased alveolar macrophage destruction and massive tissue damage by pyroptosis and necroptosis Therapeutic combinations aimed at ameliorating immunothrombosis and preventing the development of severe COVID-19 are discussed in detail.","Morris, Gerwyn; Bortolasci, Chiara C; Puri, Basant K; Olive, Lisa; Marx, Wolfgang; O039,; Neil, Adrienne; Athan, Eugene; Carvalho, Andre; Maes, Michael; Walder, Ken; Berk, Michael",Life Sci,,650

479991,Integrative Network Biology Framework Elucidates Molecular Mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 Pathogenesis,2020,"BACKGROUND: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with coronavirus disease 2019 causes significant cardiovascular involvement, which can be a determinant of clinical course and outcome. The aim of this study was to investigate whether echocardiographic measures of ventricular function were independently associated with adverse clinical course and cardiac sequelae in patients with MIS-C. METHODS: In a longitudinal observational study of 54 patients with MIS-C (mean age, 6.8 ± 4.4 years; 46% male; 56% African American), measures of ventricular function and morphometry at initial presentation, predischarge, and at a median of 3- and 10-week follow-up were retrospectively analyzed and were compared with those in 108 age- and gender-matched normal control subjects. The magnitude of strain is expressed as an absolute value. Risk stratification for adverse clinical course and outcomes were analyzed among the tertiles of clinical and echocardiographic data using analysis of variance and univariate and multivariate regression. RESULTS: Median left ventricular apical four-chamber peak longitudinal strain (LVA4LS) and left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LVGLS) at initial presentation were significantly decreased in patients with MIS-C compared with the normal cohort (16.2% and 15.1% vs 22.3% and 22.0%, respectively, P < .01). Patients in the lowest LVA4LS tertile (<13%) had significantly higher C-reactive protein and high-sensitivity troponin, need for intensive care, and need for mechanical life support as well as longer hospital length of stay compared with those in the highest tertile (>18.5%; P < .01). Initial LVA4LS and LVGLS were normal in 13 of 54 and 10 of 39 patients, respectively. There was no mortality. In multivariate regression, only LVA4LS was associated with both the need for intensive care and length of stay. At median 10-week follow-up to date, seven of 36 patients (19%) and six of 25 patients (24%) had abnormal LVA4LS and LVGLS, respectively. Initial LVA4LS < 16.2% indicated abnormal LVA4LS at follow-up with 100% sensitivity. CONCLUSION: Impaired LVGLS and LVA4LS at initial presentation independently indicate a higher risk for adverse acute clinical course and persistent subclinical left ventricular dysfunction at 10-week follow-up, suggesting that they could be applied to identify higher risk children with MIS-C.","Sanil, Yamuna; Misra, Amrit; Safa, Raya; Blake, Jennifer M; Eddine, Ahmad Charaf; Balakrishnan, Preetha; Garcia, Richard U; Taylor, Rachel; Dentel, John N; Ang, Jocelyn; Cashen, Katherine; Heidemann, Sabrina M; Bauerfield, Christian; Sethuraman, Usha; Farooqi, Ahmad; Aggarwal, Sanjeev; Singh, Gautam",J.

Because it is considered an immunosuppressant, continuation of ibrutinib is often debated when patients have an active infection, and this becomes an especially difficult decision in the setting of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Here, we describe a patient with CLL who was on ibrutinib then developed severe COVID-19 infection requiring mechanical ventilation. We elected to continue ibrutinib the same day he was intubated, reasoning that BTK inhibition in myeloid immune cells has been shown to reduce or even reverse influenza-mediated acute lung injury and that ITK inhibition in T cells has correlated with reduction in viral replication, and therefore may have an advantage in this setting. Ibrutinib also has been shown to block Src family kinases, which potentially could result in reduction of viral entry and the inflammatory cytokine response in the lungs. The patient was extubated after 9 days with a complex hospital course and eventually discharged on room air. The only way to rationally inform these decisions and explore similar potentially promising leads in this pandemic is to conduct carefully done clinical trials.","Lin, Adam Yuh; Cuttica, Michael J; Ison, Michael G; Gordon, Leo I",,,650

482475,"Growth, detection, quantification, and inactivation of SARS-CoV-2",2020,"Tests for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are intended for a disparate and shifting range of purposes: (1) diagnosing patients who present with symptoms to inform individual treatment decisions; (2) organizational uses such as ""cohorting"" potentially infected patients and staff to protect others; and (3) contact tracing, surveillance, and other public health purposes. Often lost when testing is encouraged is that testing does not by itself confer health benefits. Rather, testing is useful to the extent it forms a critical link to subsequent medical or public health interventions. Such interventions might be individual level, like better diagnosis, treatment, isolation, or quarantine of contacts. They might aid surveillance to understand levels and trends of disease within a defined population that enables informed decisions to implement or relax social distancing measures. In this article, we describe the range of available COVID-19 tests; their accuracy and timing considerations; and the specific clinical, organizational, and public health considerations that warrant different testing strategies. Three representative clinical scenarios illustrate the importance of appropriate test use and interpretation. The reason a patient seeks testing is often a strong indicator of the pretest probability of infection, and thus how to interpret test results. In addition, the level of population spread of the virus and the timing of testing play critical roles in the positive or negative predictive value of the test. We conclude with practical recommendations regarding the need for testing in various contexts, appropriate tests and testing methods, and the interpretation of test results.","Piltch-Loeb, Rachael; Jeong, Kyeong Yun; Lin, Kenneth W; Kraemer, John; Stoto, Michael A",J Am Board Fam Med,,650

This presented these trainees with novel challenges and opportunities. METHODS: A qualitative study was performed to explore these experiences, undertaking semi-structured interviews with ENT trainees between 17th and 30th July. Participants were recruited through purposeful sampling. Interview transcripts underwent thematic analysis using Dedoose software. RESULTS: Seven ENT trainees were interviewed, ranging from specialty trainee years four to eight ('ST4' to 'ST8') in grade. Six core themes were identified: organisation of redeployment, utilisation of skill set, emotional impact of redeployment, redeployed team dynamics, concerns about safety and impact on training. CONCLUSION: The ENT trainees' experiences of redeployment described highlight some important lessons and considerations for future redeployments.","Lion, P; McClenaghan, F; Hall, A; Mackinnon, S; Navaratnam, A V",J Laryngol Otol,,650

Here we conducted a retrospective longitudinal study aimed to analyze the clinical features and outcome of MHD patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Of 3126 inpatients with COVID-19 at 3 Branches of Wuhan Tongji Hospital from Jan 18th to Mar 9th, 2020, 19 patients were undergoing maintenance hemodialysis. Among the 19 MHD patients with COVID-19, 6 patients (31.6%) died, and 13 patients (68.4%) were able to be discharged. Baseline characteristics, clinical courses, laboratory findings, and dynamic trajectories of major laboratory markers were compared between survivors and nonsurvivors. According to our findings, MHD patients with COVID-19 who experienced non-surviving outcome had more elevated CRP, IL6 and procalcitonin as well as fibrinogen levels at various points compared to survivors. Thus the dysregulation of immune response as well as coagulation abnormalities might be highly involved in the pathological process of COVID-19, contributing to the poor prognosis in MHD patients.","Jin, Guan-Nan; Ding, Ze-Yang; Li, Gan-Xun; Hu, Jun-Bo; Liu, Ji-Hong; Zhang, Bixiang; Chen, Xiao-Ping",Int J Med Sci,,650

METHODS: In adult consecutive patients admitted (March 1-April 15, 2020) to the ED of a major referral centre for COVID-19, we retrospectively calculated NEWS, NEWS2, NEWS-C, MEWS, qSOFA, and REMS from physiological variables measured on arrival. Sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV), and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve of each EWS for predicting admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and death at 48â¯h and 7 days were calculated. RESULTS: We included 334 patients (119 [35.6%] females, median age 66 [54-78] years). At 7 days, the rates of ICU admission and death were 56/334 (17%) and 26/334 (7.8%), respectively. NEWS was the most accurate predictor of ICU admission within 7 days (AUROC 0.783 [95% CI, 0.735-0.826]; sensitivity 71.4 [57.8-82.7]%; NPV 93.1 [89.8-95.3]%), while REMS was the most accurate predictor of death within 7 days (AUROC 0.823 [0.778-0.863]; sensitivity 96.1 [80.4-99.9]%; NPV 99.4[96.2-99.9]%). Similar results were observed for ICU admission and death at 48â¯h. NEWS and REMS were as accurate as the triage system used in our ED. MEWS and qSOFA had the lowest overall accuracy for both outcomes. CONCLUSION: In our single-centre cohort of COVID-19 patients, NEWS and REMS measured on ED arrival were the most sensitive predictors of 7-day ICU admission or death. EWS could be useful to identify patients with low risk of clinical deterioration.","Covino, Marcello; Sandroni, Claudio; Santoro, Michele; Sabia, Luca; Simeoni, Benedetta; Bocci, Maria Grazia; Ojetti, Veronica; Candelli, Marcello; Antonelli, Massimo; Gasbarrini, Antonio; Franceschi, Francesco",Resuscitation,,650

Here we assessed the efficacy and safety of ivabradine prolonged-release (PR) once-daily (test) vs. ivabradine immediate-release (IR) twice-daily (reference) formulations in patients with stable chronic HF with systolic dysfunction. METHODS: Patients with sinus rhythm and heart rate (HR) &#8805; 50 bpm, left ventricular ejection fraction &#8804; 40% (HF with reduced ejection fraction), on guideline-based standard care, receiving a stable dose of ivabradine IR 5/7.5 mg twice daily for &#8805; 1 month were enrolled in this randomized, double-blind, phase 3 non-inferiority study. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to ivabradine PR (10 mg/15 mg) based on the ivabradine IR dosage or continued ivabradine IR (5 mg/7.5 mg). The primary endpoint was change in resting ECG HR from baseline to the end of 3 months, assessed by 12-lead ECG. Safety assessments and 24-h Holter HR monitoring (in a subgroup of patients) were also performed. Non-inferiority was concluded if the upper limit of the 95% CI of the difference between the test and reference was less than the margin of 6.5 bpm in the per-protocol set. RESULTS: A total of 169 out of 180 randomized patients (93.9%) completed the study (PR = 84; IR = 85). The least-square mean (standard error [SE]) for change in HR from baseline to 3 months was 0.76 (1.188; 95% CI -1.59:3.11) in ivabradine PR vs. ivabradine IR, which was within the pre-specified margin of 6.5 bpm, confirming the non-inferiority of ivabradine PR. The change from baseline to 3 months was comparable between the treatment groups for 24-h Holter ECG monitoring (p = 0.3701), mean HR awake (p = 0.3423), and mean HR asleep (p = 0.1501). Thirty-nine treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported; the majority in both groups were of mild or moderate severity and were subsequently resolved. Seven serious adverse events were reported (ivabradine PR = 2; ivabradine IR = 5), of which one was fatal (ivabradine IR group). The bradycardia events reported were comparable between groups. CONCLUSION: Ivabradine PR was found to be non-inferior to ivabradine IR in the management of patients with stable CHF, with a comparable safety profile. Once-daily ivabradine PR effectively maintained the HR in patients shifted from the ivabradine IR twice-daily regimen, and thus may aid in improving treatment compliance.

This scoping review aims to identify the impact of the pandemic and related factors on children's physical activity (PA). Methods Twenty-one studies published in 2020 that evaluated PA among children under the age of 18 were extracted from electronic databases. The survey contexts, samples, PA measurement methods, and main findings of each study were categorized and summarized. Results The review yielded the following results: 1) the PA of children and adolescents mostly decreased;2) the decrease in PA was more prevalent in boys and older children and adolescents;3) the decrease in PA was less prevalent in children who live in detached houses, houses with more space, rural areas, and with more family members;and 4) parental support and consideration of location and activity types may help children maintain or increase their PA during the pandemic. Conclusion This review shows a decline in PA among children and raises concerns about the pandemic’s impact on physical and mental health. Declines in PA appear greater among children who participate in organized team sports and those with limited space and opportunity for habitual PA at home or in their neighborhood. Public support for children and families should consider these findings to prevent the negative effects of physical inactivity.","Yomoda, Kenji Kurita Shohei",Journal of Exercise Science &amp; Fitness,,650
487620,Distance matrices for nitrogenous bases and amino acids of SARS-CoV-2 via structural metric,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) are capable of binding to a virus to render incapable of infection. The ability of commercially available SARS-CoV-2 serological tests to detect NAbs has not been widely reported. We sought to correlate the antibodies detected by an automated chemiluminescent immunoassay with NAbs. METHODS: Residual serum samples from 35 patients that had a positive antibody test using the LIAISON® SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG chemiluminescent immunoassay and two antibody-negative control sera were tested for NAbs using a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). RESULTS: NAbs were detected in 66% (23/35) of the antibody-positive samples. The immunoassay signal value ranged from 21.7 to 131.3 AU/mL (median, 90.5) with significant correlation between it and the PRNT (r = 0.61, p = 0.002). In the samples without NAbs, the immunoassay signal ranged from 16.3 to 66.2 AU/mL (median, 27.2). An immunoassay signal cutoff of > 41 AU/mL was 91% sensitive and 92% specific for the detection of NAbs. DISCUSSION: It is important that correlates of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 be identified and NAbs are considered to be central indicators of such. PRNT is the gold-standard test for identifying NAbs but it cannot be used for large-scale testing of populations. It is necessary to establish relationships between it and widely used commercial serological assays for SARS-CoV-2.","Grenache, David G; Ye, Chunyan; Bradfute, Steven B",,,650
488361,The SARS-CoV-2 N Protein Is a Good Component in a Vaccine,2020,"South Africa maintains the world's largest HIV prevalence, accounting for 20.4% of people living with HIV internationally. HIV Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has demonstrated efficacy; however, there is limited data on PrEP implementation in South Africa, particularly in rural areas. Using grounded theory analysis of semi-structured interviews and exploratory factor analyses of structured surveys, this mixed methods study examines healthcare workers' (HCWs)' beliefs about their patients and the likelihood of PrEP uptake in their communities. The disproportionate burden of HIV among Black South Africans is linked to the legacy of apartheid and resulting disparities in wealth and employment. HCWs in our study emphasized the importance of addressing these structural barriers, including increased travel burden among men in the community looking for work, poor transportation infrastructure, and limited numbers of highly skilled clinical staff in their rural community. HCWs also espoused a vision of PrEP that prioritizes women due to perceived constraints on their sexual agency, and that minimizes the impact of HIV-related stigma on PrEP implementation. However, HCWs' additional concerns for risk compensation may reflect dominant social mores around sexual behavior. In recognition of HCWs' role as both informants and community members, implementation scientists should invite local HCWs to partner as early as the priority-setting stage for PrEP interventions. Inviting leadership from local HCWs may increase the likelihood of delivery plans that account for unique local context and structural barriers researchers may otherwise struggle to uncover.","Asabor, Emmanuella Ngozi; Lett, Elle; Moll, Anthony; Shenoi, Sheela V",AIDS behav,,650
488492,Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by direct RT-qPCR on nasopharyngeal specimens without extraction of viral RNA,2020,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: COVID-19 pandemic led to wide-spread use of face-masks, respirators and other personal protective equipment (PPE) by healthcare workers. Various symptoms attributed to the use of PPE are believed to be, at least in part, due to elevated carbon-dioxide (CO2) levels. We evaluated concentrations of CO2 under various PPE. METHODS: In a prospective observational study on healthy volunteers, CO2 levels were measured during regular breathing while donning 1) no mask, 2) JustAir® powered air purifying respirator (PAPR), 3) KN95 respirator, and 4) valved-respirator. Serial CO2 measurements were taken with a nasal canula at a frequency of 1-Hz for 15-min for each PPE configuration to evaluate whether National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) limits were breached. RESULTS: The study included 11 healthy volunteers, median age 32 years (range 16-54) and 6 (55%) men. Percent mean (SD) changes in CO2 values for no mask, JustAir® PAPR, KN95 respirator and valve respirator were 0.26 (0.12), 0.59 (0.097), 2.6 (0.14) and 2.4 (0.59), respectively. Use of face masks (KN95 and valved-respirator) resulted in significant increases in CO2 concentrations, which exceeded the 8-h NIOSH exposure threshold limit value-weighted average (TLV-TWA). However, the increases in CO2 concentrations did not breach short-term (15-min) limits. Importantly, these levels were considerably lower than the long-term (8-h) NIOSH limits during donning JustAir® PAPR. There was a statistically significant difference between all pairs (p < 0.0001, except KN95 and valved-respirator (p = 0.25). However, whether increase in CO2 levels are clinically significant remains debatable. CONCLUSION: Although, significant increase in CO2 concentrations are noted with routinely used face-masks, the levels still remain within the NIOSH limits for short-term use. Therefore, there should not be a concern in their regular day-to-day use for healthcare providers. The clinical implications of elevated CO2 levels with long-term use of face masks needs further studies. Use of PAPR prevents relative hypercapnoea. However, whether PAPR should be advocated for healthcare workers requiring PPE for extended hours needs to evaluated in further studies.","Rhee, Michelle S M; Lindquist, Carin D; Silvestrini, Matthew T; Chan, Amanda C; Ong, Jonathan J Y; Sharma, Vijay K",BMC Infect Dis,,650

Several sample-to-answer platforms, including Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 (Xpert Xpress), have received emergency use authorization for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection as a point of care test in the United States. However, their application niche is unclear when compared with with real-RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) assays cleared by the National Medical Products Administration in China. In this study, the clinical performance, sensitivity, and workflow of Xpert Xpress and two rRT-PCR kits (BioGerm kit and Sansure kit) from 86 symptomatic patients were evaluated. The positive percent agreement of Xpert Xpress was 100% compared with 96.15% for the BioGerm kit and 90% for the Sansure kit. The negative percent agreement was 100% for all three assays. The limit of detection is 100 copies/mL for Xpert Xpress and 500 copies/mL for the BioGerm kit and Sansure kit. By serially diluting five positive specimens, the Xpert Xpress had better detection capability. In the workflow and throughput analysis, the turnaround time was 51 minutes for Xpert Xpress, 150 minutes for the BioGerm kit, and 210 minutes for the Sansure kit. This study provides some indication for diagnosis methods selection.","Wen, Donghua; Yang, Simin; Li, Guangbo; Xuan, Qiankun; Guo, Wenzheng; Wu, Wenjuan",J. mol. diagn,,650

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study compared stroke patients admitted to a comprehensive stroke center during the COVID-19 pandemic April 1 2020 to June 30 2020 (COVID-19) to patients admitted April 1 2019 to June 30 2019. We examined stroke admission volume and acute stroke treatment use. RESULTS: There were 637 stroke admissions, 52% in 2019 and 48% during COVID-19, with similar median admissions per day (4 vs 3, P=0.21). The proportion of admissions by stroke type was comparable (ischemic, P=0.69; hemorrhagic, P=0.39; transient ischemic stroke, P=0.10). Acute stroke treatment was similar in 2019 to COVID-19: tPA prior to arrival (18% vs, 18%, P=0.89), tPA treatment on arrival (6% vs 7%, P=0.85), and endovascular therapy (endovascular therapy (ET), 22% vs 25%, P=0.54). The door to needle time was also similar, P=0.12, however, the median time from arrival to groin puncture was significantly longer during COVID-19 (38 vs 43 min, P=0.002). A significantly higher proportion of patients receiving ET were intubated during COVID-19 due to SNIS guideline implementation (45% vs 96%, P<0.0001). There were no differences by study period in discharge mRS, P=0.84 or TICI score, P=0.26. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic did not significantly affect stroke admission volume or acute stroke treatment utilization. Outcomes were not affected by implementing SNIS guidelines. Although there was a statistical increase in time to groin puncture for ET, it was not clinically meaningful. These results suggest hospitals managing patients efficiently can implement practices in response to COVID-19 without impacting outcomes.","Atchie, Benjamin; Jarvis, Stephanie; Stoddard, Erica; Salottolo, Kristin; Nieberlein, Amy; McCarthy, Kathryn; Bartt, Russell; Bennett, Alicia; Burrell, Christian; Frei, Donald; Bar-Or, David",J. neurointerv. surg.

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the data of STEMI patients admitted to the Hangzhou Chest Pain Center (CPC) during a COVID-19 epidemic period in 2020 (24 cases) and the same period in 2019 (29 cases). General characteristics of the patients were recorded, analyzed, and compared. Moreover, we compared the groups for the time from symptom onset to the first medical contact (SO-to-FMC), time from first medical contact to balloon expansion (FMC-to-B), time from hospital door entry to first balloon expansion (D-to-B), and catheter room activation time. The groups were also compared for postoperative cardiac color Doppler ultrasonographic left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF),the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE),Kaplan-Meier survival curves during the 28 days after the operation. RESULTS: The times of SO-to-FMC, D-to-B, and catheter room activation in the 2020 group were significantly longer than those in the 2019 group (P < 0.05). The cumulative mortality after the surgery in the 2020 group was significantly higher than the 2019 group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The pre-hospital and in-hospital treatment times of STEMI patients during the COVID-19 epidemic were longer than those before the epidemic. Cumulative mortality was showed in Kaplan-Meier survival curves after the surgery in the 2020 group was significantly different higher than the 2019 group during the 28 days.The diagnosis and treatment process of STEMI patients during an epidemic should be optimized to improve their prognosis.","Fu, Xin-Yan; Shen, Xiang-Feng; Cheng, Yong-Ran; Zhou, Meng-Yun; Ye, Lan; Feng, Zhan-Hui; Xu, Zhao; Chen, Juan; Wang, Ming-Wei; Zhang, Xing-Wei",Am. j. emerg. med,,650

495612,Partially versus Purely Data-Driven Approaches in SARS-CoV-2 Prediction,2020,"AIM: The COVID-19 crisis is affecting our sense of self and touches upon its existential fears. This extends to the self-other relationship as there is both being infected and infecting the other. What this pandemic crisis tells us about our self and relatedness, its cultural differences, and how these are rooted in the brain's relation to the world. METHODS: First, we discuss about the psychological and neuronal features of self and and self-other relation and how they are rooted in a deeper layer of the brain's neural activity complemeting its cognitive surface layer. Secondly, we demonstrate cultural differences of eastern and western concepts of self, i.e., independency and inter-dependency, and how these reflect the manifestation of the brain's neuro-social and -ecological alignment. Finally, we highlight how inter-subjective and cultural nature of self surface in the COVID-19 crisis. RESULTS: Discussing various lines of empirical data showing the brain's intimate alignment to both social and ecological environmental contexts our results support the assumption of the brain's deep layer features by laying bare a continuum of different degrees of neuro-social and neuro-ecological alignment. This entails a a two-stage model of self with neuro-social-ecological and psychological levels that extends the previously suggested basis model of self-specificity (BMSS). CONCLUSION: We conclude that the current pandemic shows the importance of the deeper inter-subjective and cultural layers of both self and brain; their neglect can be life-threatening for self and others and, paradoxically, might reduce, rather than enlarge, the self's sense of freedom and independence.

In the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic, there has been renewed interest in the drug hydroxychloroquine. However, clinicians should be aware of the dangers of hydroxychloroquine intoxication, an insufficiently studied condition. Case Report. We present a case of autointoxication with 20 g hydroxychloroquine in a 35-year-old woman. Cardiac monitoring showed ventricular arrhythmias for which high-dose midazolam and propofol were initiated, resulting in a brief normalization of the cardiac rhythm. Because of the reoccurrence of these arrhythmias, intravenous lipid emulsion was administered with fast cardiac stabilization. Treatment with continuous norepinephrine, potassium chloride/phosphate, and sodium bicarbonate was initiated. On day 6, she was extubated and after 11 days, she was discharged from the hospital without complications. Conclusion. Since high-quality scientific evidence is lacking, treatment options are based on experience in chloroquine toxicity. Activated charcoal is advised if the patient presents early. Sedation with diazepam, early ventilation, and continuous epinephrine infusion are considered effective in treating severe intoxication. Caution is advised when substituting potassium. Despite the lack of formal evidence, sodium bicarbonate appears to be useful and safe in case of QRS widening. Intravenous lipid emulsion, with or without hemodialysis, remains controversial but appears to be safe. As a last resort, extracorporeal life support might be considered in case of persisting hemodynamic instability.

498750,Bioinformatic analysis of the whole genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from Indonesia,2021,"Commercial fisheries globally experienced numerous and significant perturbations during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, affecting the livelihoods of millions of fishers worldwide. In the Northeast United States, fishers grappled with low prices and disruptions to export and domestic markets, leaving many tied to the dock, while others found ways to adapt to the changing circumstances brought about by the pandemic. This paper investigates the short-term impacts of the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic (March-June 2020) on commercial fishers in the Northeast U.S. to understand the effects of the pandemic on participation in the fishery and fishers' economic outcomes, using data collected from an online survey of 258 Northeast U.S. commercial fishers. This research also assesses characteristics of those fishers who continued fishing and their adaptive strategies to the changing circumstances. Analysis of survey responses found the majority of fishers continued fishing during the early months of the pandemic, while a significant number had stopped fishing. Nearly all reported a loss of income, largely driven by disruptions of export markets, the loss of restaurant sales, and a resulting decline in seafood prices. Landings data demonstrate that while fishing pressure in 2020 was reduced for some species, it remained on track with previous years for others. Fishers reported engaging in a number of adaptation strategies, including direct sales of seafood, switching species, and supplementing their income with government payments or other sources of income. Many fishers who had stopped fishing indicated plans to return, suggesting refraining from fishing as a short-term adaptation strategy, rather than a plan to permanently stop fishing. Despite economic losses, fishers in the Northeast U.S. demonstrated resilience in the face of the pandemic by continuing to fish and implementing other adaptation strategies rather than switching to other livelihoods.","Smith, Sarah Lindley; Golden, Abigail S; Ramenzoni, Victoria; Zemeckis, Douglas R; Jensen, Olaf P",PLoS One,,650

500054,"In silico, 6lu7 protein inhibition using dihydroxy-3-phenyl coumarin derivatives for SARS-CoV-2",2020,"BACKGROUND: Remdesivir is being studied and used for treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). PURPOSE: To update a previous review of remdesivir for adults with COVID-19, including new meta-analyses of patients with COVID-19 of any severity compared with control. DATA SOURCES: Several sources from 1 January 2020 through 7 December 2020. STUDY SELECTION: English-language, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of remdesivir for COVID-19. New evidence is incorporated by using living review methods. DATA EXTRACTION: 1 reviewer abstracted data; a second reviewer verified the data. The Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) method were used. DATA SYNTHESIS: The update includes 5 RCTs, incorporating data from a new large RCT and the final results of a previous RCT. Compared with control, a 10-day course of remdesivir probably results in little to no reduction in mortality (risk ratio [RR], 0.93 [95% CI, 0.82 to 1.06]; 4 RCTs) but may result in a small reduction in the proportion of patients receiving mechanical ventilation (RR, 0.71 [CI, 0.56 to 0.90]; 3 RCTs). Remdesivir probably results in a moderate increase in the percentage of patients who recovered and a moderate decrease in serious adverse events and may result in a large reduction in time to recovery. Effect on hospital length of stay or percentage remaining hospitalized is mixed. Compared with a 10-day course for those not requiring ventilation at baseline, a 5-day course may reduce mortality, the need for ventilation, and serious adverse events while increasing the percentage of patients who recovered or clinically improved. LIMITATION: Summarizing findings was challenging because of varying disease severity definitions and outcomes. CONCLUSION: In hospitalized adults with COVID-19, remdesivir probably results in little to no mortality difference but probably improves the percentage recovered and reduces serious harms and may result in a small reduction in the proportion receiving ventilation. For patients not receiving ventilation, a 5-day course may provide greater benefits and fewer harms with lower drug costs than a 10-day course.

501225,The effect of spike mutations on SARS-CoV-2 neutralization,2021,"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has crushed daily routines and is still rampaging through the world. Existing solution for nonpharmaceutical interventions usually needs to timely and precisely select a subset of residential urban areas for containment or even quarantine, where the spatial distribution of confirmed cases has been considered as a key criterion for the subset selection. While such containment measure has successfully stopped or slowed down the spread of COVID-19 in some countries, it is criticized for being inefficient or ineffective, as the statistics of confirmed cases are usually time-delayed and coarse-grained. To tackle the issues, we propose C-Watcher, a novel data-driven framework that aims at screening every neighborhood in a target city and predicting infection risks, prior to the spread of COVID-19 from epicenters to the city. In terms of design, C-Watcher collects large-scale long-term human mobility data from Baidu Maps, then characterizes every residential neighborhood in the city using a set of features based on urban mobility patterns. Furthermore, to transfer the firsthand knowledge (witted in epicenters) to the target city before local outbreaks, we adopt a novel adversarial encoder framework to learn ""city-invariant"" representations from the mobility-related features for precise early detection of high-risk neighborhoods, even before any confirmed cases known, in the target city. We carried out extensive experiments on C-Watcher using the real-data records in the early stage of COVID-19 outbreaks, where the results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of C-Watcher for early detection of high-risk neighborhoods from a large number of cities.","Xiao, C.

507141,"The Impact of Covid-19 on Millennial Perceptions of Experience Quality and Flow of Experience and Its Influence on Behavior Intention to Revisit a Nature and Rural Destination (Case on Jakarta, Indonesia)",2021,"The recent coronavirus pandemic follows in its early stages an almost exponential expansion, with the number of cases $N$ reasonably well fit by $N\propto e^{\alpha t}$, in many countries. We analyze the rate $\alpha$ in 42 different countries, choosing as a starting point in each country the first day with 30 cases and fitting for the following 12 days, capturing thus the early exponential growth in a rather homogeneous way. We look for a link between the rate $\alpha$ and the average temperature $T$ of each country, in the month of the epidemic growth. Fitting with a linear behavior $\alpha(T)$, we find evidence for a decreasing growth rate as a function of $T$. However, a decrease in the growth rate is visible also in the very low-$T$ data. Going beyond a linear model, a peak at about $(9.5\pm 2.6)^\circ C$ seems to be present in the data. Our findings give hope that, for northern hemisphere countries, the growth rate should significantly decrease as a result of both warmer weather and lockdown policies. In general the propagation should be hopefully stopped by strong lockdown, testing and tracking policies, before the arrival of the next cold season.","Notari, Alessio",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.12417v2.pdf,650

517367,Ovarian Aging: Molecular Mechanisms and Medical Management,2021,"BACKGROUND: Bupivacaine, an amid-type local anesthetic, is widely used for clinical patients especially in pregnant women. In addition to neurotoxicity effect of bupivacaine, it can cross the placenta, accumulates in this tissue and retained in fetal tissues. Nevertheless, whether bupivacaine can cause neurotoxicity in fetus remains unclear. Hence, this study was design to investigate the effects of maternal bupivacaine use on fetus hippocampal cell apoptosis and the possible related mechanism. METHODS: On day 15 of pregnancy, sciatic nerve of pregnant wistar rat (180-200 g) were exposed by lateral incision of the right thigh and 0.2 ml of bupivacaine was injected. After their delivery, we randomly selected one male offspring of every mother. On day 30 after of their birth, the rat's hippocampi were isolated for molecular studies. Western blotting was used to examine the expression of cleaved caspase-3, caspase-8 and p-Akt in fetal hippocampus. RESULTS: Our results showed that maternal bupivacaine use caused a significant increment of cleaved caspase-3 and caspase-8 expression in fetal hippocampus compared with the sham group. In addition, maternally administered bupivacaine could significantly decrease hippocampal P.Akt/T.Akt ratio which was concurrent with an increment of cleaved caspase-3 and caspase-8 expression. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that maternal bupivacaine use increases fetal hippocampal cell apoptosis markers such as caspase 8 and cleaved caspase 3, at least in part, via inhibiting the Akt activation.","Mirkheshti, Alireza; Shakeri, Alireza; Memary, Elham; Baniasadi, Mansoureh; Zaringhalam, Jalal; Tajbakhsh, Ardeshir; Mirzaei, Marzieh; Lak, Elena",BMC Anesthesiol,,650
517597,"Host-cell recognition through GRP78 is enhanced in the new UK variant of SARS-CoV-2, in silico",2021,"The emergence of a novel human corona virus disease (COVID-19) has been declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. One of the mechanisms of airborne transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome - corona virus (SARS-CoV-2) amid humans is through direct ejection of droplets via sneezing, coughing and vocalizing. Nevertheless, there are ample evidences of the persistence of infectious viruses on inanimate surfaces for several hours to a few days. Through a critical review of the current literature and a preliminary analysis of the link between SARS-CoV-2 transmission and air pollution in the affected regions, we offer a perspective that polluted environment could enhance the transmission rate of such deadly viruses under moderate-to-high humidity conditions. The aqueous atmospheric aerosols offer a conducive surface for adsorption/absorption of organic molecules and viruses onto them, facilitating a pathway for higher rate of transmission under favourable environmental conditions. This mechanism partially explains the role of polluted air besides the exacerbation of chronic respiratory diseases in the rapid transmission of the virus amongst the public. Hence, it is stressed that more ambitious policies towards a cleaner environment are required globally to nip in the bud what could be the seeds of a fatal outbreak such as COVID-19.","Manoj, M G; Satheesh Kumar, M K; Valsaraj, K T; Sivan, C; Vijayan, Soumya K",Environ Res,,650

Therefore, the aim of this study was to conduct a literature review on placental changes in infected pregnant women and/or asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19 during pregnancy, aiming at the possible vertical transmission. A systematic collection was carried out on the effects of that COVID-19 can cause directly and/or indirectly to pregnancy and the placenta in the following databases: Pubmed, Science Direct, Scielo, Lilacs, and Web of Science. For search, the following descriptors were used: placenta, pregnant woman, COVID-19, maternal-fetal. The results indicate transplacental transmission in some cases reviewed in many reports from this study. The presence of the virus was seen in the amniotic fluid, umbilical cord, and peripheral blood. Finally, pathological studies suggest that there are morphological changes related to infection in the placentas. We can conclude that, based on the researched material, there is little evidence of transplacental vertical viral transmission and its respective morphological changes related to viral infection in the placenta.","da Costa, Marcos Aurélio Santos; de Albuquerque Britto, Diana Babini Lapa; da Silva, Maria Eduarda; de Carvalho, Jennyfer Martins; de Oliveira, Maria Luísa Figueira; da Silva Gomes, José Anderson; Mendes Tenorio, Fernanda das Chagas Angelo; Leite, Sônia Pereira",Biol Reprod,,650

Methods: The novel coronavirus pneumonia TCM stage, clinical manifestations and the function of CGGD were analyzed by literature mining and clinical reports. TCMSP database was used to screen potential active components and related targets in CGGD. PubMed database was used to screen pneumonia, cough and fever related targets. With the help of Cytoscape software, a “drug-disease-target” visual network diagram and protein interaction network were constructed, and GO and pathway enrichment analysis of key targets was performed through the STRING database. The active ingredients were molecularly docked with SARS-CoV-2 3CL hydrolase protein and ACE2 by AutoDock Vina. Results: The analysis of the relationship between prescriptions and syndromes showed that CGGD could play warm-yang scattered cold, resolve dampness, clear stagnation and heat, and open up membrane’s power to intervene in early cold-dampness lung type COVID-19. Through screening, the therapeutic effects of CGGD were mainly in 156 chemical components acting on 159 related targets. The core 27 genes predicted and analyzed included EGFR, TP53, YWHAZ, HSP90AB1, PIK3R1, GRB2, etc. GO and pathway analysis showed that CGGD was mainly involved in biological processes such as cell regulation and immune system related pathways to play a therapeutic role. The 10 core components were molecularly docked, saikosaponin A, saikosaponin D, and peroxyergosterol in CGGD had good affinity with 3CL hydrolase protein and ACE2. Conclusion: Using network pharmacology and molecular docking technology to predict that CGGD can be used for the treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia with symptom of cold-dampness obstructing lungs in early stage, potential antiviral ingredients contained in prescription of CGGD, can play a therapeutic role in the treatment of new type of coronavirus pneumonia in the early stage by regulating the immune system.

This paper addresses this challenge using the SIMLR model, which incorporates machine learning (ML) into the epidemiological SIR model. For each region, SIMLR tracks the changes in the policies implemented at the government level, which it uses to estimate the time-varying parameters of an SIR model for forecasting the number of new infections 1- to 4-weeks in advance.It also forecasts the probability of changes in those government policies at each of these future times, which is essential for the longer-range forecasts. We applied SIMLR to data from regions in Canada and in the United States,and show that its MAPE (mean average percentage error) performance is as good as SOTA forecasting models, with the added advantage of being an interpretable model. We expect that this approach will be useful not only for forecasting COVID-19 infections, but also in predicting the evolution of other infectious diseases.","Vega, Roberto; Flores, Leonardo; Greiner, Russell",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.01590v1.pdf,650

From March 10 through May 1, 2020, 103 lung ultrasound exams were performed by our Forward Intensive Care Team (FICT) on 26 patients (18 males and 8 females), aged 62 (54 - 76) and with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30.9 (28.7 - 31.5), a median 6 (5 - 9) days after admission to the COVID-19 medical unit of the University Hospital of Parma, Italy. All patients underwent chest computed tomography (CT) the day of admission. The initial LUS was 16 (11 - 21), which did not significantly correlate with initial CT scans, probably due to rapid progression of the disease and time between CT scan on admission and first FICT evaluation; conversely, LUS was significantly correlated with PaO2/FiO2 ratio throughout patient follow-up [R = - 4.82 (- 6.84 to - 2.80; p < 0.001)].

Just like every other area, the medical field has been dramatically impacted by the need to care for a large number of patients while at the same time protecting staff, patients, and their families. Changes in the wake of the pandemic called for the prompt and extensive rechanneling and re-organization of resources. The pandemic has opened challenges and concerns for patient safety, starting with the early recognition that individuals, including medical staff, may spread the virus during the asymptomatic phase. Many healthcare facilities faced resource-limited settings, including challenges in the availability of personal protective equipment for healthcare providers. Additionally, the pandemic has disrupted medical education, both at the undergraduate and at the graduate levels, and according to many predictions, its effects may forever transform the ways medical education is delivered. In this chapter, we are exploring the history of medical education, describe changes in medical education experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, and predict some of the considerations worth taking into account when envisioning the future of medical education.","Nentin, Farida; Gabbur, Nagaraj; Katz, Adi",Adv Exp Med Biol,,650

In addition, the aging world population inevitably leads to higher demand for better artificial organ (AO) devices. Membrane technology is the central component in many of the AO devices including lung, kidney, liver and pancreas. Although AO technology has improved significantly in the past few decades, the quality of life of organ failure patients is still poor and the technology must be improved further. Most of the current AO literature focuses on the treatment and the clinical use of AO, while the research on the membrane development aspect of AO is relatively scarce. One of the speculated reasons is the wide interdisciplinary spectrum of AO technology, ranging from biotechnology to polymer chemistry and process engineering. In this review, in order to facilitate the membrane aspects of the AO research, the roles of membrane technology in the AO devices, along with the current challenges, are summarized. This review shows that there is a clear need for better membranes in terms of biocompatibility, permselectivity, module design, and process configuration.","Duy Nguyen, Bao Tran; Nguyen Thi, Hai Yen; Nguyen Thi, Bich Phuong; Kang, Dong-Ku; Kim, Jeong F",,,650

The partial ban on livestock imports from Somalia imposed by Saudi Arabia due to animal health concerns has resulted in significant negative economic impacts for the government and the value chain actors involved. In previous years, the ban was lifted during the Hajj season to meet the increased demand for sheep and goats. However, given the current COVID-19 pandemic, the Saudi government decided to suspend Umrah visits in 2020 and only allowed a very restricted number of persons to attend the Hajj pilgrimage, thus obviating the need for livestock imports. This study quantified the economic losses associated the current partial livestock ban (started in November 2016) on Somali imports and the added impacts associated with COVID. We estimate that the cumulative losses for the Somaliland livestock sector and the government are US$ 770 million over a five-year period. The additional losses imposed by the COVID pandemic, which restricted participation during the Hajj season, were estimated at US$ 42 million. Livestock producers, who are mainly pastoralists, are the most affected stakeholder group, incurring around 54% of the total losses.

We assessed for a range of effects of the pandemic on ALHIV in western Kenya, and whether effects were greater for ALHIV with recent histories of being lost to program (LTP). METHODS: ALHIV were recruited from an ongoing prospective study at 3 sites in western Kenya. The parent study enrolled participants from February 2019–September 2020, into groups of ALHIV either 1) retained in care or 2) LTP and traced in the community. Phone interviews from July 2020–January 2021 assessed effects of the pandemic on financial and food security, healthcare access and behaviors, and mental health. Responses were compared among the parent study groups. RESULTS: Phone surveys were completed with 334 ALHIV or their caregivers, including 275/308 (89.3%) in the retained group and 59/70 (84.3%) among those LTP at initial enrollment. During the pandemic, a greater proportion of LTP adolescents were no longer engaged in school (45.8% vs. 36.4%, p = 0.017). Over a third (120, 35.9%) of adolescents reported lost income for someone they relied on. In total, 135 (40.4%) did not have enough food either some (121, 36.2%) or most (14, 4.2%) of the time. More LTP adolescents (4/59, 6.8% vs. 2/275, 0.7%, p = 0.010) reported increased difficulties refilling ART. Adolescent PHQ-2 and GAD-2 scores were ≥3 for 5.6% and 5.2%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has had devastating socioeconomic effects for Kenyan ALHIV and their households. ALHIV with recent care disengagement may be especially vulnerable. Meanwhile, sustained ART access and adherence potentially signal resilience and strengths of ALHIV and their care programs. Findings from this survey indicate the critical need for support to ALHIV during this crisis.","Enane, Leslie A.; Apondi, Edith; Aluoch, Josephine; Bakoyannis, Giorgos; Lewis Kulzer, Jayne; Kwena, Zachary; Kantor, Rami; Chory, Ashley; Gardner, Adrian; Scanlon, Michael; Goodrich, Suzanne; Wools-Kaloustian, Kara; Elul, Batya; Vreeman, Rachel C.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34506555/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0257210,650

The mechanism by which soot nanoparticles form within hydrocarbon flames is still an unsolved problem in combustion science. Mechanisms proposed to date involving purely chemical growth are limited by slow reaction rates, whereas mechanisms relying on solely physical interactions between molecules are limited by weak intermolecular interactions that are unstable at flame temperatures. Here, we show evidence for a reactive π-diradical aromatic soot precursor imaged using non-contact atomic force microscopy. Localization of π-electrons on non-hexagonal rings was found to allow for Kekulé aromatic soot precursors to possess a triplet diradical ground state. Barrierless chain reactions are shown between these reactive sites, which provide thermally stable aromatic rim-linked hydrocarbons under flame conditions. Quantum molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate physical condensation of aromatics that survive for tens of picoseconds. Bound internal rotors then enable the reactive sites to find each other and become chemically cross-linked before dissociation. These species provide a rapid, thermally stable chain reaction toward soot nanoparticle formation and could provide molecular targets for limiting the emission of these toxic combustion products.","Martin, Jacob W.; Pascazio, Laura; Menon, Angiras; Akroyd, Jethro; Kaiser, Katharina; Schulz, Fabian; Commodo, Mario; D’Anna, Andrea; Gross, Leo; Kraft, Markus",J Am Chem Soc,https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.1c05030; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34338507/,650

Our results evince that the signs developed in felids show similar progression to those occurring in humans, suggesting a relationship between the viral cycle and target tissues of the virus in different species. ABSTRACT: Recently, it has been proved that SARS-CoV-2 has the ability to infect multiple species. This work was aimed at identifying the clinical signs of SARS-CoV-2 infection in domestic and wild felids. A PRISMA-based systematic review was performed on case reports on domestic and wild cats, reports on experimental infections, case reports in databases, preprints and published press releases. Descriptive statistical analysis of the data was performed. A total of 256 articles, 63 detailed official reports and 2 press articles on SARS-CoV-2 infection in domestic and wild cats were analyzed, of which 19 articles and 65 reports were finally included. In domestic cats, most cats’ infections are likely to be asymptomatic, and 46% of the reported infected animals were symptomatic and predominantly presented respiratory signs such as sneezing and coughing. In wild felines, respiratory clinical signs were most frequent, and up to 96.5% of the reported affected animals presented coughing. It is noteworthy that, to date, symptomatic animals with SARS-CoV-2 infection have been reported to belong to two different subfamilies (Phanterinae and Felinae), with up to five different felid species affected within the Felidae family. Reported results evince that the signs developed in felids show similar progression to those occurring in humans, suggesting a relationship between the viral cycle and target tissues of the virus in different species. While viral transmission to humans in contact with animal populations has not been reported, spill-back could result in the emergence of immune-escape mutants that might pose a risk to public health. Despite the clear results in the identification of the typical clinical picture of SARS-CoV-2 infection in felines, the number of detailed academic reports and papers on the subject is scarce. Therefore, further description of these cases will allow for more accurate and statistically robust clinical approaches in the future.","Giraldo-Ramirez, Sebastian; Rendon-Marin, Santiago; Jaimes, Javier A.; Martinez-Gutierrez, Marlen; Ruiz-Saenz, Julian",Animals (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34359182/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ani11072056,650

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to spread through the global population causing widespread morbidity, mortality, and socioeconomic chaos. Using SARS-CoV-2 as our model and starting with a gBlocks encoded nucleocapsid (N) gene, we purified recombinant protein from E. coli, to serve as bait for selecting semisynthetic nanobodies from our Nomad single-pot library. Clones were isolated in days and first fused to Gaussia luciferase to determine EC(50) in the tens of nM range, and second fused to the ascorbate peroxidase derivative APEX2 for sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. To generate inherently fluorescent immunoreagents, we introduce novel periplasmic sdAb fusions made with mNeonGreen and mScarlet-I, which were produced at milligram amounts. The fluorescent fusion proteins enabled concise visualization of SARS-CoV-2 N in the cytoplasm but not in the nucleus 24 h post infection, akin to the distribution of SARS-CoV N, thereby validating these useful imaging tools. SdAb reactivity appeared specific to SARS-CoV-2 with very much weaker binding to SARS-CoV, and no noticeable cross-reactivity to a panel of overexpressed human codon optimized N proteins from other CoV. High periplasmic expression levels and in silico immortalization of the nanobody constructs guarantees a cost-effective and reliable source of SARS-CoV-2 immunoreagents. Our proof-of-principle study should be applicable to known and newly emerging CoV to broaden the tools available for their analysis and help safeguard human health in a more proactive than reactive manner.","Sherwood, Laura Jo; Hayhurst, Andrew",ACS Synth Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33534552/; https://doi.org/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00566,650

However, first studies indicated that convalescent plasma treatment might improve the clinical outcome of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) patients. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In the current study, we investigated the efficacy of convalescent plasma treatment in eight COVID‐19 patients. All the patients were critically ill, and seven of them were SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA–positive when starting treatment. SARS‐CoV‐2–specific antibodies were determined by an enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay detecting immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against the S1 protein (Euroimmun), and the neutralizing titers were determined with a cell‐culture‐based neutralization assay. Plasma treatment started between 4 and 23 days after the onset of symptoms. The patients were usually treated by three plasma units, each containing 200–280 ml, which was applied at day 1, 3, and 5. RESULTS: Donor sera had on average lower IgG antibody ratios and neutralizing titers than the COVID‐19 patients before the onset of treatment (median ratio of 5.8 and neutralizing titer of 1:320 vs. 7.5 and 1:640, respectively). Nevertheless, we observed an increase of antibody ratios in seven and of neutralizing titers in five patients after treatment; which did, however, not correlate with patient survival. Plasma treatment was effective in three patients, but five deceased despite treatment. Patients who deceased had a later treatment onset than survivors and finally died from multiple organ failure. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that the efficacy of convalescent plasma treatment of critically ill COVID‐19 patients who already had developed strong antiviral immune responses and organ complications is limited.","Lindemann, Monika; Lenz, Veronika; Knop, Dietmar; Klump, Hannes; Alt, Mira; Aufderhorst, Ulrich W.; Schipper, Leonie; Schwarzkopf, Sina; Meller, Lara; Steckel, Nina; Koldehoff, Michael; Heinold, Andreas; Heinemann, Falko M.; Fischer, Johannes; Hutschenreuter, Gabriele; Knabbe, Cornelius; Dolff, Sebastian; Brenner, Thorsten; Dittmer, Ulf; Witzke, Oliver; Herbstreit, Frank; Horn, Peter A.; Krawczyk, Adalbert",Transfusion,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33784412/; https://doi.org/10.1111/trf.16392,650
594271,Generation of Recombinant SARS‐CoV‐2 Using a Bacterial Artificial Chromosome,2020-10-13,"Background The detection of SARS-CoV-2 by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in respiratory samples collected from persons recovered from COVID-19 does not necessarily indicate shedding of infective virions. By contrast, the isolation of SARS-CoV-2 using cell-based culture likely indicates infectivity, but there are limited data on the correlation between SARS-CoV-2 culture and PCR. Here we review our experience using SARS-CoV-2 culture to determine infectivity and safe de-isolation of COVID-19 patients. Methods 195 patients with diverse severity of COVID-19 were tested (outpatients [n=178]), inpatients [n=12] and ICU [n=5]). SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive samples were cultured in Vero C1008 cells and inspected daily for cytopathic effect (CPE). SARS-CoV-2-induced CPE was confirmed by PCR of culture supernatant. Where no CPE was documented, PCR was performed on day four to confirm absence of virus replication. Cycle threshold (Ct) values of the day four PCR (Ctculture) and the PCR of the original clinical sample (Ctsample) were compared, and positive cultures were defined as a Ctsample - Ctculture value of greater than or equal to 3. Findings Of 234 samples collected, 228 (97%) were from the upper respiratory tract. SARS-CoV-2 was only successfully isolated from samples with Ctsample values <32, including in 28/181 (15%), 19/42 (45%) and 9/11 samples (82%) collected from outpatients, inpatients and ICU patients, respectively. The mean duration from symptom onset to culture positivity was 4.5 days (range 0-18 days).

594290,The Antiviral Effect of the Chemical Compounds Targeting DED/EDh Motifs of the Viral Proteins on Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus and SARS-CoV-2,2021-06-24,"BACKGROUND: COVID‐19 can present with lymphopenia and extraordinary complex multiorgan pathologies that can trigger long‐term sequela. AIMS: Given that inflammasome products, like caspase‐1, play a role in the pathophysiology of a number of co‐morbid conditions, we investigated caspases across the spectrum of COVID‐19 disease. MATERIALS & METHODS: We assessed transcriptional states of multiple caspases and using flow cytometry, the expression of active caspase‐1 in blood cells from COVID‐19 patients in acute and convalescent stages of disease. Non‐COVID‐19 subject presenting with various comorbid conditions served as controls. RESULTS: Single‐cell RNA‐seq data of immune cells from COVID‐19 patients showed a distinct caspase expression pattern in T cells, neutrophils, dendritic cells, and eosinophils compared with controls. Caspase‐1 was upregulated in CD4+ T‐cells from hospitalized COVID‐19 patients compared with unexposed controls. Post‐COVID‐19 patients with lingering symptoms (long‐haulers) also showed upregulated caspase‐1activity in CD4+ T‐cells that ex vivo was attenuated with a select pan‐caspase inhibitor. We observed elevated caspase‐3/7levels in red blood cells from COVID‐19 patients compared with controls that was reduced following caspase inhibition. DISCUSSION: Our preliminary results suggest an exuberant caspase response in COVID‐19 that may facilitate immune‐related pathological processes leading to severe outcomes. Further clinical correlations of caspase expression in different stages of COVID‐19 will be needed. CONCLUSION: Pan‐caspase inhibition could emerge as a therapeutic strategy to ameliorate or prevent severe COVID‐19.","Plassmeyer, Matthew; Alpan, Oral; Corley, Michael J.; Premeaux, Thomas A.; Lillard, Kimberleigh; Coatney, Paige; Vaziri, Tina; Michalsky, Suzan; Pang, Alina P.

594603,"Protocol for safe, affordable, and reproducible isolation and quantitation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from wastewater",2021-09-23,"Regulation of gene expression has emerged as a fundamental element of transcript homeostasis. Key effectors in this process are the Argonautes (AGOs), highly specialized RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that form complexes, such as the RNA-Induced Silencing Complex (RISC). AGOs dictate post-transcriptional gene-silencing by directly loading small RNAs and repressing their mRNA targets through small RNA-sequence complementarity. The four human highly-conserved family-members (AGO1, AGO2, AGO3, and AGO4) demonstrate multi-faceted and versatile roles in transcriptome’s stability, plasticity, and functionality. The post-translational modifications of AGOs in critical amino acid residues, the nucleotide polymorphisms and mutations, and the deregulation of expression and interactions are tightly associated with aberrant activities, which are observed in a wide spectrum of pathologies. Through constantly accumulating information, the AGOs’ fundamental engagement in multiple human diseases has recently emerged. The present review examines new insights into AGO-driven pathology and AGO-deregulation patterns in a variety of diseases such as in viral infections and propagations, autoimmune diseases, cancers, metabolic deficiencies, neuronal disorders, and human infertility. Altogether, AGO seems to be a crucial contributor to pathogenesis and its targeting may serve as a novel and powerful therapeutic tool for the successful management of diverse human diseases in the clinic.","Pantazopoulou, Vasiliki I.; Georgiou, Stella; Kakoulidis, Panos; Giannakopoulou, Stavroula N.; Tseleni, Sofia; Stravopodis, Dimitrios J.; Anastasiadou, Ema",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32503341/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21114007,650

Currently, there are many worries about the rapid spread of COVID-19; there is no approved treatment for this infectious disease, despite many efforts to develop therapeutic procedures for COVID-19. Emerging evidence shows that mesenchymal stromal/stem cell (MSC) therapy can be a suitable option for the management of COVID-19. These cells have many biological features (including the potential of differentiation, high safety and effectiveness, secretion of trophic factors and immunoregulatory features) that make them suitable for the treatment of various diseases. However, some studies have questioned the positive role of MSC therapy in the treatment of COVID-19. Accordingly, in this paper, we will focus on the therapeutic impacts of MSCs and their critical role in cytokine storm of COVID-19 patients.","Ebrahimi, Mohsen; Rad, Mohammad Taha Saadati; Zebardast, Arghavan; Ayyasi, Mitra; Goodarzi, Golnaz; Tehrani, Sadra Samavarchi",Cell biochem. funct,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34545605/; https://doi.org/10.1002/cbf.3670,650
595179,Contribution of SARS-CoV-2 accessory proteins to viral pathogenicity in K18 hACE2 transgenic mice,2021-03-10,"OBJECTIVES: A cornerstone of our healthcare system’s response to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic is widespread testing to facilitate both isolation and early treatment. When patients refuse to undergo coronavirus disease testing, they compromise not only just their own health but also the health of those around them. The primary objective of our review is to identify the most ethical way a given healthcare system may respond to a patient’s refusal to undergo coronavirus disease 2019 testing. DATA SOURCES: We apply a systematic approach to a true clinical case scenario to evaluate the ethical merits of four plausible responses to a patient’s refusal to undergo coronavirus disease testing. Although our clinical case is anecdotal, it is representative of our experience at our University Tertiary Care Center. DATA EXTRACTION: Each plausible response in the case is rigorously analyzed by examining relevant stakeholders, facts, norms, and ethical weight both with respect to individuals’ rights and to the interests of public health. We use the “So Far No Objections” method as the ethical approach of choice because it has been widely used in the Ethics Modules of the Surgical Council on Resident Education Curriculum of the American College of Surgeons. DATA SYNTHESIS: Two ethically viable options may be tailored to individual circumstances depending on the severity of the patient’s condition. Although unstable patients must be assumed to be coronavirus disease positive and treated accordingly even in the absence of a test, stable patients who refuse testing may rightfully be asked to seek care elsewhere. CONCLUSIONS: Although patient autonomy is a fundamental principle of our society’s medical ethic, during a pandemic we must, in the interest of vulnerable and critically ill patients, draw certain limits to obliging the preferences of noncritically ill patients with decisional capacity.","Kopar, Piroska K.; Kramer, Jessica B.; Brown, Douglas E.; Bochicchio, Grant V.",Crit Care Explor,https://doi.org/10.1097/cce.0000000000000326; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33521645/,650

There is an urgent need for sensitive diagnostic testing implementation to control and manage SARS-CoV-2 in public health laboratories. The quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) assay is the gold standard method, but the sensitivity and specificity of SARS-CoV-2 testing are dependent on a number of factors. METHODS: We synthesized RNA based on the genes published to estimate the concentration of inactivated virus samples in a biosafety level 3 laboratory. The limit of detection (LOD), linearity, accuracy, and precision were evaluated according to the bioanalytical method validation guidelines. RESULTS: We found that the LOD reached around 3 copies/reaction. Furthermore, intra-assay precision, accuracy, and linearity met the accepted criterion with an RSD for copies of less than 25%, and linear regression met the accepted R(2) of 0.98. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that synthesized RNA based on the database of the NCBI gene bank for estimating the concentration of inactivated virus samples provides a potential opportunity for reliable testing to diagnose coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as well as limit the spread of the disease. This method may be relatively quick and inexpensive, and it may be useful for developing countries during the pandemic era.

This study aimed to quantify the tradeoff of PA under fine particulate matter (PM(2.5)) air pollution by estimating the optimal PA duration under alternative pollution levels. METHODS: A risk-benefit analysis was performed to estimate the optimal outdoor moderate PA (MPA) duration under varying PM(2.5) concentrations. RESULTS: An inverse nonlinear relationship was identified between optimal MPA duration and background PM(2.5) concentration levels. When background PM(2.5) concentration increased to 186 µg/m(3), the optimal outdoor MPA duration decreased to 2.5 h/week, the minimum level recommended by current PA guidelines. When background PM(2.5) concentration further increased to 235 µg/m(3), the optimal outdoor MPA duration decreased to 1 h/week. The relationship between optimal MPA duration and background PM(2.5) concentration levels was stronger when exercising at a location closer to a source of air pollution. Compared to the general adult population, adults aged 60 years and older had a substantially steeper curve—the optimal outdoor MPA duration decreased to 2.5 h/week when background PM(2.5) concentration reached 45 µg/m(3). CONCLUSION: The health benefit of outdoor MPA by far outweighs the health risk of PM(2.5) pollution for the global average urban background concentration (22 μg/m(3)). This modeling study examined a single type of air pollutant and suffered from measurement errors and estimation uncertainties. Future research should examine other air pollutants and indoor PA, incorporate short- and mid-term health effects of MPA and air pollution into the risk-benefit analysis, and provide estimates specific for high-risk subgroups.","An, Ruopeng; Kang, Hyojung; Cao, Lianzhong; Xiang, Xiaoling",J Sport Health Sci,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jshs.2020.09.008; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095254620301277?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33035708/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2095254620301277,650

Patients infected with 2019-nCoV are at risk for developing respiratory failure and requiring admission to critical care units. While providing optimal treatment for these patients, careful execution of infection control measures is necessary to prevent nosocomial transmission to other patients and to healthcare workers providing care. Although the exact mechanisms of transmission are currently unclear, human-to-human transmission can occur, and the risk of airborne spread during aerosol-generating medical procedures remains a concern in specific circumstances. This paper summarizes important considerations regarding patient screening, environmental controls, personal protective equipment, resuscitation measures (including intubation), and critical care unit operations planning as we prepare for the possibility of new imported cases or local outbreaks of 2019-nCoV. Although understanding of the 2019-nCoV virus is evolving, lessons learned from prior infectious disease challenges such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome will hopefully improve our state of readiness regardless of the number of cases we eventually manage in Canada.","Wax, Randy S.; Christian, Michael D.",Can J Anaesth,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12630-020-01591-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32052373/,650

We sought to disentangle individual and census tract-level sociodemographic and economic factors associated with these disparities. METHODS AND FINDINGS: All adults tested for SARS-CoV-2 between February 1 and June 21, 2020 were geocoded to a census tract based on their address; hospital employees and individuals with invalid addresses were excluded. Individual (age, sex, race/ethnicity, preferred language, insurance) and census tract-level (demographics, insurance, income, education, employment, occupation, household crowding and occupancy, built home environment, and transportation) variables were analyzed using linear mixed models predicting infection, hospitalization, and death from SARS-CoV-2. Among 57,865 individuals, per capita testing rates, individual (older age, male sex, non-White race, non-English preferred language, and non-private insurance), and census tract-level (increased population density, higher household occupancy, and lower education) measures were associated with likelihood of infection. Among those infected, individual age, sex, race, language, and insurance, and census tract-level measures of lower education, more multi-family homes, and extreme household crowding were associated with increased likelihood of hospitalization, while higher per capita testing rates were associated with decreased likelihood. Only individual-level variables (older age, male sex, Medicare insurance) were associated with increased mortality among those hospitalized. CONCLUSIONS: This study of the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in a major U.S. city presents the cascade of outcomes following SARS-CoV-2 infection within a large, multi-ethnic cohort. SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalization rates, but not death rates among those hospitalized, are related to census tract-level socioeconomic characteristics including lower educational attainment and higher household crowding and occupancy, but not neighborhood measures of race, independent of individual factors.","Cromer, Sara J.; Lakhani, Chirag M.; Wexler, Deborah J; Burnett-Bowie, Sherri-Ann M.; Udler, Miriam; Patel, Chirag J.",medRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.30.20201830; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.30.20201830v1?rss=1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33024982/,650

However, whether ACE plays an immune function against viral infection in vector insects is unclear. In this study, an ACE gene (LsACE) from the small brown planthopper was found to respond to Rice stripe virus (RSV) infection. The enzymatic activities of LsACE were characterized at different pH and temperature. Twenty planthopper proteins were found to interact with LsACE. RSV infection significantly upregulated LsACE expression in the testicle and fat body. When the expression of LsACE in viruliferous planthoppers was inhibited, the RNA level of the RSV SP gene was upregulated 2-fold in planthoppers, and all RSV genes showed higher RNA levels in the rice plants consumed by these planthoppers, leading to a higher viral infection rate and disease rating index. These results indicate that LsACE plays a role in the immune response against RSV transmission by planthoppers.","Wang, Xue; Wang, Wei; Zhang, Wenzhong; Li, Jing; Cui, Feng; Qiao, Luqin",Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31247402/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682219301278; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682219301278; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2019.05.007,650

We studied spike-specific antibody responses following first and/or second Covid-19 vaccination in 299 patients with CLL compared with healthy donors. 286 patients underwent extended interval (10–12 week) vaccination. 154 patients received the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine and 145 patients received ChAdOx1. Blood samples were taken either by venepuncture or as dried blood spots on filter paper. Spike-specific antibody responses were detectable in 34% of patients with CLL after one vaccine (n = 267) compared to 94% in healthy donors with antibody titres 104-fold lower in the patient group. Antibody responses increased to 75% after second vaccine (n = 55), compared to 100% in healthy donors, although titres remained lower. Multivariate analysis showed that current treatment with BTK inhibitors or IgA deficiency were independently associated with failure to generate an antibody response after the second vaccine.

The enthalpy changes associated with these sequential processes and with the overall dissociation reaction A:B2(cr) â A(cr) + 2B(cr) were determined by solution calorimetry. It was found that they are all positive, indicating that there is a lattice enthalpy gain when MA:Phe2 is formed, either from the individual precursors or by adding Phe to MA:Phe. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis showed that MA:Phe2 is best described as a protic salt containing a maleate anion (MA-) and two non-equivalent L-phenylalanine units, both linked to MA- by NH···O hydrogen bonds (H-bond): one of these units is protonated (HPhe+) and the other zwitterionic (Phe±). Only MA- and HPhe+ molecules are present in the MA:Phe lattice. In this case, however, NH···O and OH···O H-bonds are formed between each MA- unit and two HPhe+ molecules. Despite these structural differences, the enthalpy cost for the removal of the zwitterionic Phe± unit from the MA:Phe2 lattice to yield MA:Phe is only 0.9 ± 0.4 kJ mol-1 higher than that for the dissociation of MA:Phe, which requires a proton transfer from HPhe+ to MA- and the rearrangement of L-phenylalanine to the zwitterionic, Phe±, form. Finally, a comparison of the dissociation energetics and structures of MA:Phe and of the previously reported glycine maleate (MA:Gly) analogue indicated that parameters, such as the packing coefficient, density, hydrogen bonds formed, or fusion temperature, are not necessarily good descriptors of dissociation enthalpy or lattice enthalpy trends when bi-component crystals with different molecular composition are being compared, even if the stoichiometry is the same.","Feliciano, Inês O; Silva, Daniela P; Piedade, M Fátima M; Bernardes, Carlos E S; Minas da Piedade, Manuel E",Molecules (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules26185714; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34577186/,650

In 2017, urban neuropsychologists and a pediatrician practicing in a rural region of New Mexico started to develop a teleneuropsychology (TeleNP) consultation service model to efficiently triage and determine a clinical course of action. This pilot project, aimed at expanding clinical access to specialized pediatric services in rural areas, evolved over the course of 2 years prior to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. METHOD: Providers earned the trust of the local community, gained understanding of pertinent sociocultural factors, and acquired knowledge of the clinical and educational concerns for the children residing in the rural community. The application of a culturally informed approach that highlights the importance of community participation and collaboration steered the decision to implement a TeleNP consultation model. By widening access to neuropsychology, this service helped to determine whether neuropsychological testing procedures were medically indicated. RESULTS: We summarize the distinct processes that needed to occur at each location to support the implementation of telemedicine.

To improve HCV case finding in these individuals, we examined the feasibility of rapid HCV RNA testing in homeless services in Amsterdam. In 2020, we provided a comprehensive service to homeless facilities, which included workshops on HCV for personnel, a “hepatitis ambassador” at each facility, a rapid, onsite HCV RNA fingerstick test service, and assistance with linkage to care. Risk factors for HCV RNA-positive status were examined using Bayesian logistic regression. Of the 152 participants enrolled, 150 (87% men; median age: 47 years) accepted rapid HCV testing. Seven tested HCV RNA positive (4.7%, 95%CrI = 1.31–8.09; 7/150). Of these, five (71%) were linked to care, of whom four (57%, 4/7) initiated treatment and one (14%, 1/7) delayed treatment due to a drug–drug interaction. Of these four people, two completed treatment (50%), of whom one (25%) achieved sustained virologic response after 12 weeks. HCV RNA-positive individuals were more likely to originate from Eastern Europe (posterior-odds ratio (OR) = 3.59 (95% credible interval (CrI) = 1.27–10.04)) and to inject drugs (ever: posterior-OR = 3.89 (95% CrI = 1.37–11.09); recent: posterior-OR = 3.94 (95% CrI = 1.29–11.71)). We identified HCV RNA-positive individuals and linkage to care was relatively high. Screening in homeless services with rapid testing is feasible and could improve HCV case finding for PWID who do not regularly attend primary care or other harm reduction services for people who use drugs.","Generaal, Ellen; Logtenberg van der Grient, Hilje; Schatz, Eberhard; van Santen, Daniela K.; Boyd, Anders; Woods, Sara K.; Baak, Bert L.

603229,Die Virologie von SARS-CoV-2,2020-10-30,"Ethnopharmacological relevance Artemisia annua L. has been used for millennia in Southeast Asia to treat “fever”. Many infectious microbial and viral diseases have been shown to respond to A. annua and communities around the world use the plant as a medicinal tea, especially for treating malaria. Aim of the Study SARS-CoV-2 (the cause of Covid-19) globally has infected and killed millions of people. Because of the broad-spectrum antiviral activity of artemisinin that includes blockade of SARS-CoV-1, we queried whether A. annua suppressed SARS-CoV-2. Materials and Methods Using Vero E6 and Calu-3 cells, we measured anti viral activity SARS-CoV-2 activity against fully infectious virusof dried leaf extracts of seven cultivars of A. annua sourced from four continents. IC50s were calculated and defined as (the concentrations that inhibited viral replication by 50%.) and CC50s (the concentrations that kill 50% of cells) were calculated. Results Hot-water leaf extracts based on artemisinin, total flavonoids, or dry leaf mass showed antiviral activity with IC50 values of 0.1-8.7 μM, 0.01-0.14 μg, and 23.4-57.4 μg, respectively. Antiviral efficacy did not correlate with artemisinin or total flavonoid contents of the extracts. One dried leaf sample was >12 years old, yet the hot-water extract was still found to be active. The UK and South African variants, B1.1.7 and B1.351, were similarly inhibited. While all hot water extracts were effective, concentrations of artemisinin and total flavonoids varied by nearly 100-fold in the extracts. Artemisinin alone showed an estimated IC50 of about 70 μM, and the clinically used artemisinin derivatives artesunate, artemether, and dihydroartemisinin were ineffective or cytotoxic at elevated micromolar concentrations. In contrast, the antimalarial drug amodiaquine had an IC50 = 5.8 μM. Extracts had minimal effects on infection of Vero E6 or Calu-3 cells by a reporter virus pseudotyped by the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. There was no cytotoxicity within an order of magnitude above the antiviral IC90 values. Conclusions A. annua extracts inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the active component(s) in the extracts is likely something besides artemisinin or a combination of components that block virus infection at a step downstream of virus entry. Further studies will determine in vivo efficacy to assess whether A. annua might provide a cost-effective therapeutic to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections. List of compounds studied Amodiaquine Artemisinin Artesunate Artemether Deoxyartemisinin Dihydroartemisinin Highlights Artemisia annua is effective in stopping replication of SARS-CoV-2 including 2 new variants. The anti-viral effect does not correlate to artemisinin, nor to the total flavonoid content. The anti-viral mechanism does not appear to involve blockade virus entry into cell. The plant offers two additional benefits: a decreased inflammatory response and blunting of fibrosis. A. annua may provide a safe, low-cost alternative for treating patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.","Nair, M.S.; Huang, Y.; Fidock, D.A.; Polyak, S.J.; Wagoner, J.; Towler, M.J.; Weathers, P.J.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.08.425825; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33442683/,650

The purpose of the study was to develop an intervention-training program using an intervention mapping approach (IMA) to prevent COVID-19 infection in adults at the time of the pandemic by health workers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study was a study protocol where IMA was used as a planning framework for developing an intervention-training program to prevent COVID-19 infection in adults at the time of the pandemic by health workers in Ardabil city. Six intervention mapping (IM) steps have been described in this protocol. As the first step, needs assessment was performed by reviewing the studies, qualitative evaluation, and interviews. In the second step, the matrix of change objectives was designed from the intersection of performance goals and determinants. Later on, after designing the program and planning the program implementation, the program evaluation plan was developed. RESULTS: IMA guided us in designing and implementing a control-oriented training program with the participation of the participants along with the definition of outcomes, performance goals and determinants, theoretical methods and practical applications, intervention program, implementation, and step by step assessment. CONCLUSION: IM is a control-oriented, systematic, participation-based approach to design and implement targeted and on-going health promotion programs based on the needs of the target group at the time of the pandemic by health workers.","Nejhaddadgar, Nazila; Azadi, Hamed; Mehedi, Nafiul; Toghroli, Razie; Faraji, Azam",J Educ Health Promot,https://doi.org/10.4103/jehp.jehp_1398_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33688533/,650
603573,Spike Proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Utilize Different Mechanisms to Bind With Human ACE2,2020-12-09,"Due to our interest in the chemical space of organic dyes to identify potential small-molecule inhibitors (SMIs) for protein-protein interactions (PPIs), we initiated a screen of such compounds to assess their inhibitory activity against the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and its cognate receptor ACE2, which is the first critical step initiating the viral attachment and entry of this coronavirus responsible for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. As part of this, we found that methylene blue, a tricyclic phenothiazine compound approved by the FDA for the treatment of methemoglobinemia and used for other medical applications (including the inactivation of viruses in blood products prior to transfusion when activated by light), inhibits this interaction. We confirmed that it does so in a concentration-dependent manner with a low micromolar half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50) = 3 μM) in our protein-based ELISA-type setup, while chloroquine, siramesine, and suramin showed no inhibitory activity in this assay. Erythrosine B, which we have shown before to be a promiscuous SMI of PPIs, also inhibited this interaction. Methylene blue inhibited the entry of a SARS-CoV-2 spike bearing pseudovirus into ACE2-expressing cells with similar IC(50) (3.5 μM). Hence, this PPI inhibitory activity could contribute to its antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 even in the absence of light by blocking its attachment to ACE2-expressing cells and making this inexpensive and widely available drug potentially useful in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 as an oral or inhaled medication.","Bojadzic, Damir; Alcazar, Oscar; Buchwald, Peter",Front Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2020.600372; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33519460/,650

The ability of sea urchin spinochromes—echinochrome A (EchA) and its aminated analogues, echinamines A (EamA) and B (EamB)—to inhibit different stages of HSV-1 infection in Vero cells and to reduce the virus-induced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was studied. We found that spinochromes exhibited maximum antiviral activity when HSV-1 was pretreated with these compounds, which indicated the direct effect of spinochromes on HSV-1 particles. EamB and EamA both showed the highest virucidal activity by inhibiting the HSV-1 plaque formation, with a selectivity index (SI) of 80.6 and 50.3, respectively, and a reduction in HSV-1 attachment to cells (SI of 8.5 and 5.8, respectively). EamA and EamB considerably suppressed the early induction of ROS due to the virus infection. The ability of the tested compounds to directly bind to the surface glycoprotein, gD, of HSV-1 was established in silico. The dock score of EchA, EamA, and EamB was −4.75, −5.09, and −5.19 kcal/mol, respectively, which correlated with the SI of the virucidal action of these compounds and explained their ability to suppress the attachment and penetration of the virus into the cells.","Mishchenko, Natalia P.; Krylova, Natalia V.; Iunikhina, Olga V.; Vasileva, Elena A.; Likhatskaya, Galina N.; Pislyagin, Evgeny A.; Tarbeeva, Darya V.; Dmitrenok, Pavel S.; Fedoreyev, Sergey A.",Mar Drugs,https://doi.org/10.3390/md18110550; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33167501/,650

The author suggests that the medical education community must embrace any positive changes that come about as a result of the pandemic while continuing to systematically review the strengths and areas for improvement in the current transition to residency process. In its recommendations, InCUS provided a thoughtful set of action priorities and an effective process to work together, which can inform and guide the work ahead. The COVID-19 pandemic is dominating the educational and clinical environments and is now the biggest disruptor in all aspects of life, not just medical education. It is the responsibility of leaders in medical education to have a vision for and then implement an improved continuum of education that maintains the core values of the field and fits the health care delivery needs of today and the future.","Whelan, Alison J.",Acad Med,https://doi.org/10.1097/acm.0000000000003449; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32324640/,650

METHODS: This study is a partial economic evaluation and a cross-sectional cost-description study conducted based on the data of the COVID-19 patients referred to a referral university hospital in Fars province between March and July 2020. The data were collected by examining the patients’ records and accounting information systems. The subjects included all the inpatients with COVID-19 (477 individuals) who admitted to the medical centre during the 4 months. Bottom-up costing (also called micro-costing approach), incidence-based and income-based human capital approaches were used as the main methodological features of this study. RESULTS: The direct medical costs were estimated to be 28,240,025,968 Rials ($ 1,791,172) in total with mean cost of 59,203,409 Rials ($ 3755) per person (SD = 4684 $/ 73,855,161 Rials) in which significant part (41%) was that of intensive and general care beds (11,596,217,487 Rials equal to $ 735,510 (M = 24,310,728 Rials or $ 1542, SD = 34,184,949 Rials or $ 2168(. The second to which were the costs of medicines and medical consumables (28%). The mean indirect costs, including income loss due to premature death, economic production loss due to hospitalization and job absenteeism during recovery course were estimated to be 129,870,974 Rials ($ 11,634) per person. Furthermore, the economic burden of the disease in the country for inpatient cases with the definitive diagnosis was 22,688,925,933,095 Rials equal to $ 1,439,083,784. CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that the severe status of the disease would bring about the extremely high cost of illness in this case. It is estimated that the high prevalence rate of COVID-19 has been imposing a heavy economic burden on the country and health system directly that may result in rationing or painful cost-control approaches.","Ghaffari Darab, Mohsen; Keshavarz, Khosro; Sadeghi, Elnaz; Shahmohamadi, Javad; Kavosi, Zahra",BMC Health Serv Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33573650/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-021-06126-8,650

It is vital to uncover and investigate the full genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 throughout the world to track changes in this virus. To this purpose, SARS-CoV-2 full genome sequence profiling of 20 patients in Iran and different countries that already had a travel history to Iran or contacts with Iranian cases were provided from the GISAID database. The bioinformatics analysis showed 44 different nucleotide mutations that caused 26 nonsynonymous mutations in protein sequences with regard to the reference full genome of the SARS-CoV-2 sequence (NC_045512.2). R207C, V378I, M2796I, L3606F, and A6407V in ORF1ab were common mutations in these sequences. Also, some of the detected mutations only were found in Iranian data in comparison with all the available sequences of SARS-CoV-2. The position of S protein mutations showed they were far from the binding site of this protein with angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) as the host cell receptor.

However, for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, there is limited specific guidance regarding the proper disinfection methods that should be used. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the literature on cleaning, disinfection or decontamination methods in the prevention of SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: A total of 27 studies were included, reporting a variety of methods with which the effectiveness of interventions were assessed. Virus was inoculated onto different types of material including masks, nasopharyngeal swabs, serum, laboratory plates and simulated saliva, tears or nasal fluid and then interventions were applied in an attempt to eliminate the virus including chemical, ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation, and heat and humidity. At body temperature (37°C) there is evidence that the virus will not be detectable after 2 days but this can be reduced to non-detection at 30 min at 56°C, 15 min at 65°C and 2 min at 98°C. Different experimental methods testing UV light have shown that it can inactivate the virus. Light of 254–365 nm has been used, including simulated sunlight. Many chemical agents including bleach, hand sanitiser, hand wash, soap, ethanol, isopropanol, guandinium thiocynate/t-octylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol, formaldehyde, povidone-iodine, 0.05% chlorhexidine, 0.1% benzalkonium chloride, acidic electrolysed water, Clyraguard copper iodine complex and hydrogen peroxide vapour have been shown to disinfect SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: Heating, UV light irradiation and chemicals can be used to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 but there is insufficient evidence to support one measure over others in clinical practice.","Kwok, Chun Shing; Dashti, Mustafa; Tafuro, Jacopo; Nasiri, Mojtaba; Muntean, Elena-Andra; Wong, Nicholas; Kemp, Timothy; Hills, George; Mallen, Christian D.",Ther Adv Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1177/2049936121998548; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33796289/,650

Given the numbers of food insecure and malnourished people on the rise, the heterogeneity of nutritional statuses and needs, and the even worse context of COVID-19 pandemic, this has become an urgent challenge for food-related policies. This paper provides a comprehensive microsimulation approach to evaluate economic policies on food access, sufficiency (energy) and adequacy (protein, fat, carbohydrate) at household level. The improvement in market access conditions in Kenya is simulated as an application case of this method, using original insights from households’ surveys and biochemical and nutritional information by food item. Simulation’s results suggest that improving market access increases food purchasing power overall the country, with a pro-poor impact in rural areas. The daily energy consumption per capita and macronutrients intakes per capita increase at the national level, being the households with at least one stunted child under 5 years old, and poor households living areas outside Mombasa and Nairobi, those which benefit the most. The developed method and its Kenya's application contribute to the discussion on how to evaluate nutrition-sensitive policies, and how to cover most households suffering food insecurity and nutrition deficiencies in any given country.

608552,The local anaesthetic procaine prodrugs ProcCluster® and Procaine-hydrochloride impair SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro,2021-06-07,"The new epidemiological scenario has so far focused on the environmental circulation of human viral pathogens. Owing to the side effects of chemical disinfectants, there is an increasing need for knowledge on the use of virucidal compounds, especially those of a natural origin. Climacostol is a molecule produced by a freshwater ciliate and it exhibits activity against bacterial and fungal pathogens. We thus also speculated that there might be an effect on viral viability, which has never been tested. To evaluate such activity, we chose human adenovirus (HAdV), which is representative of waterborne viruses. We conducted experiments using HAdV serotype 5, whose titer was determined by infecting HeLa cell cultures. HAdV5 was shown to be sensitive to climacostol at a concentration of 0.0002 mg/mL, with an approximate 3 Log(10) reduction when the initial titer of HAdV5 was approximately 10(4) and 10(3) TCID(50)/mL. These preliminary results could be an important starting point for further research aimed at improving the characterization of climacostol activity under different experimental conditions and against various viruses, including enveloped ones (i.e., the coronavirus). The production of climacostol by a protist living in fresh water also suggests a possible application in the activated sludge of wastewater treatment plants.","Verani, Marco; Di Giuseppe, Graziano; Federigi, Ileana; Buonanno, Federico; Ortenzi, Claudio; Carducci, Annalaura",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32570859/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v12060658,650

Neutralizing antibody responses to the original Wuhan-Hu-1 strain that were generated during infection and vaccination showed lower effectiveness against variants of concern. Here, we demonstrated that mouse plasma induced by protein nanoparticles that present rationally designed S2GΔHR2 spikes can neutralize the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 variants with comparable titers. The mechanism of nanoparticle vaccine-induced immunity was examined in mice for an I3–01v9 60-mer that presents 20 stabilized spikes. Compared with the soluble spike, this nanoparticle showed 6-fold longer retention, 4-fold greater presentation on follicular dendritic cell dendrites, and 5-fold higher germinal center reactions in lymph node follicles. Intact nanoparticles in lymph node tissues were visualized by transmission electron microscopy. In conclusion, spike-presenting protein nanoparticles that induce robust long-lived germinal centers may provide a vaccine solution for emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.","Zhang, Yi-Nan; Paynter, Jennifer; Fourfouris, Tatiana; Sou, Cindy; Ngo, Timothy; He, Linling; Zhu, Jiang",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33791704/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.26.437274,650

METHODS Using a multi-pathogen Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) transmission model formalizing co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2 and another respiratory virus, we assess how an outbreak of secondary virus may affect two COVID-19 surveillance indicators: testing demand and positivity. Using simulation, we assess to what extent the use of multiplex PCR tests on a subsample of symptomatic individuals can help correct of the observed SARS-CoV-2 percent positivity and improve surveillance quality. RESULTS We find that a non-SARS-CoV-2 epidemic strongly increases SARS-CoV-2 daily testing demand and artificially reduces the observed SARS-CoV-2 percent positivity for the duration of the outbreak. We estimate that performing one multiplex test for every 1,000 COVID-19 tests on symptomatic individuals could be sufficient to maintain surveillance of other respiratory viruses in the population and correct the observed SARS-CoV-2 percent positivity. CONCLUSIONS This study highlights that co-circulating respiratory viruses can distort SARS-CoV-2 surveillance. Correction of the positivity rate can be achieved by using multiplex PCR tests, and a low number of samples is sufficient to avoid bias in SARS-CoV-2 surveillance.","Kovacevic, Aleksandra; Eggo, Rosalind M; Baguelin, Marc; Domenech de Cellès, Matthieu; Opatowski, Lulla",The Journal of infectious diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34514500/; https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiab459,650

Drawing on Job Demands-Resources theory and data from a sample of 1,548 Australian high school students in nine schools, we examined the role of adaptability in predicting students’ online learning self-efficacy in mathematics and their end of year mathematics achievement. It was found that beyond the effects of online learning demands, online and parental learning support, and background attributes, adaptability was significantly associated with higher levels of online learning self-efficacy and with gains in later achievement; online learning self-efficacy was also significantly associated with gains in achievement—and significantly mediated the relationship between adaptability and achievement.

612046,Antigenic relationships of murine coronaviruses,1983,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) of bat origin have caused two pandemics in this century. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV both originated from bats, and it is highly likely that bat coronaviruses will cause future outbreaks. Active surveillance is both urgent and essential to predict and mitigate the emergence of these viruses in humans. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is currently the preferred methodology for virus discovery to ensure unbiased sequencing of bat CoVs, considering their high genetic diversity. However, unbiased NGS is an expensive methodology and is prone to missing low-abundance CoV sequences due to the high background level of nonviral sequences present in surveillance field samples. Here, we employ a capture-based NGS approach using baits targeting most of the CoV species. Using this technology, we effectively reduced sequencing costs by increasing the sensitivity of detection. We discovered nine full genomes of bat CoVs in this study and revealed great genetic diversity for eight of them. IMPORTANCE Active surveillance is both urgent and essential to predict and mitigate the emergence of bat-origin CoV in humans and livestock. However, great genetic diversity increases the chance of homologous recombination among CoVs. Performing targeted PCR, a common practice for many surveillance studies, would not reflect this diversity. NGS, on the other hand, is an expensive methodology and is prone to missing low-abundance CoV sequences. Here, we employ a capture-based NGS approach using baits targeting all CoVs. Our work demonstrates that targeted, cost-effective, large-scale, genome-level surveillance of bat CoVs is now highly feasible.","Li, Bei; Si, Hao-Rui; Zhu, Yan; Yang, Xing-Lou; Anderson, Danielle E.; Shi, Zheng-Li; Wang, Lin-Fa; Zhou, Peng",mSphere,https://doi.org/10.1128/msphere.00807-19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31996413/,650

Several recent studies hypothesized that bats, an ancient group of flying mammals, are the major reservoir of several important RNA virus families from which other mammalian viruses of livestock and humans were derived. Although this hypothesis needs further investigation, the premise that bats carry a large number of viruses is commonly accepted. The question of whether bats have unique biological features making them ideal reservoir hosts has been the subject of several recent reviews.

This is a narrative review of the available literature on the key capabilities of AI to help anesthesiologists, surgeons, and other physicians to understand and critically evaluate ongoing and new AI applications in perioperative management. AI uses available databases called “big data” to formulate an algorithm. Analysis of other data based on these algorithms can help in early diagnosis, accurate risk assessment, intraoperative management, automated drug delivery, predicting anesthesia and surgical complications and postoperative outcomes and can thus lead to effective perioperative management as well as to reduce the cost of treatment. Perioperative physicians, anesthesiologists, and surgeons are well-positioned to help integrate AI into modern surgical practice. We all need to partner and collaborate with data scientists to collect and analyze data across all phases of perioperative care to provide clinical scenarios and context.

Nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) is known to affect human health, causing heart and cardiovascular diseases, and it has been shown that locations with long term NO(2) pollution recorded a high number of fatalities due to the COVID-19 pandemic. There are no ground stations monitoring emissions of NO(2) over West Africa. The present study aimed to use satellite observations to examine pollutant trends over this region. OBJECTIVE. To examine the trend of NO(2) over the entire West Africa sub region in relationship to contributions to environmental emissions using satellite-derived data. This enables the assessment of West Africa regional air pollution hot spots in relationship to enhancing atmospheric factors. The results from this study will also be useful guidance for setting air quality standards for air pollution controls to minimize health hazards. METHODS. The present study examined thirteen years of average monthly values of nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) to determine the spatio-temporal variation of this pollutant over West Africa. Satellite data for NO(2) between 2005 and 2017 were used to determine the variation in pollution levels over West Africa. Correlations between NO(2) and meteorological variables (wind speed, rainfall and air temperature) were obtained to explain the influence of West African weather on the region's pollution accumulation. RESULTS. The present study observed that NO(2) concentrations varied from place to place and from season to season. Nitrogen dioxide concentrations during the dry season were higher (sometimes 200% higher) than values observed in the wet season which ranged between 0.5 and 6×10(15) molec/cm(2). Nitrogen dioxide north-south oscillation during the course of a year is largely controlled by the inter-tropical discontinuity (ITD) zone as high concentrations of NO(2) are found in the vicinity of the ITD where wind speeds and horizontal vorticity approaches zero. Correlation analysis between NO(2) and some atmospheric variables indicated NO(2) concentrations are well influenced by atmospheric variables showing bipolar signals depending on the season. An increasing trend of NO(2) was also found over selected cities of the region. This indicated that regional air quality is gradually deteriorating. CONCLUSIONS. The implications of worsening regional air quality were examined in the light of the prevailing COVID-19 pandemic. The dominant atmospheric factor determining pollution episodes in the region is the inter-tropical discontinuity line which marks the meeting point between the two wind regimes over the region. Densely populated areas are characteristically prone to elevated pollution and have experienced high fatalities during the COVID-19 pandemic. COMPETING INTERESTS.

Neutrophils infiltrate the airways of pediatric patients with RSV-induced bronchiolitis in vast numbers: approximately 80% of infiltrated cells are neutrophils. However, why neutrophils are recruited to the site of viral respiratory tract infection is not clear. In this review we discuss the beneficial and pathologic contributions of neutrophils to the immune response against RSV infection. Neutrophils can limit viral replication and spread, as well as stimulate an effective antiviral adaptive immune response. However, low specificity of neutrophil antimicrobial armaments allows for collateral tissue damage. Neutrophil-induced injury to the airways during the delicate period of infant lung development has lasting adverse consequences for pulmonary architecture and might promote the onset of asthma in susceptible subjects. We suggest that pharmacologic modulation of neutrophils should be explored as a viable future therapy for severe RSV-induced bronchiolitis and thereby prevent the inception of subsequent asthma. The antiviral functions of neutrophils suggest that targeting of neutrophils in patients with RSV-induced bronchiolitis is best performed under the umbrella of antiviral treatment.","Geerdink, Ruben J.; Pillay, Janesh; Meyaard, Linde; Bont, Louis",J Allergy Clin Immunol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2015.06.034; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091674915009331; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674915009331; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26277597/,650

Resolution of inflammation is an active process, and the pro-resolution effects of lipoxins, resolvins and protectins have received significant interest. Here, we review emerging data on the role of these lipid mediators in infectious disease. Lipoxins influence host control of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Toxoplasma gondii, Trypanosoma cruzi and Plasmodium berghei cerebral malaria in mice. Their effects are protective in toxoplasmosis, T. cruzi infection and cerebral malaria but detrimental in tuberculosis; related to the balance between pathogen-control and excessive immune response. Topical lipoxin abrogates the tissue damage seen in a rabbit model of Porphyromonas gingivalis periodontitis. The increased virulence of H5N1 influenza A virus in mice correlates with reduced expression of SOCS2, required to mediate the effects of lipoxin. Mice unable to synthesize lipoxin suffer increased lung pathology during respiratory syncytial virus infection. Protectin suppresses influenza A virus replication in vitro and increases survival in a mouse model of severe influenza infection. Resolvins were investigated in a number of animal models of systemic bacterial infection, and were found to enhance phagocytic clearance of bacteria, reduce inflammation severity, promote neutrophil apoptosis, modulate neutrophil chemotaxis and importantly, reduce mortality. Interestingly, resolvin also enhances the antibacterial effect of ciprofloxacin and vancomycin. Topical resolvin application reduces the severity of herpes simplex virus ocular infection in mice. If the effects of these mediators translate from pre-clinical studies into successful clinical trials, they represent promising new strategies in managing infectious disease.","Russell, Clark D; Schwarze, Jürgen",Immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24400794/; https://doi.org/10.1111/imm.12206,650

METHODS: Original studies reporting the association between patient safety and the use of eHealth as a means of communication between patients and healthcare providers were included. Four literature databases were searched for English-language articles reporting results from cohort studies and clinical trials, published from 2015 until March 2021. Moreover, registered private eHealth clinics in Denmark were evaluated with reference to a recent national audit of patient safety issues in eHealth. RESULTS: The literature search retrieved four intervention studies. The studies did not identify any particular patient safety risks associated with the use of eHealth. Many different authorized healthcare providers (preferably, doctors) apply eHealth in various contexts. eHealth is being used as the only form of contact between the healthcare provider and the patient, as a supplement to patient visitations in an outpatient clinic, or as a tool for communicating between two or more healthcare providers. The regulation of eHealth involves patient safety issues but also has interfaces to marketing, IT systems, and infrastructure. Supervision of eHealth includes the organization of clinics, handling patient charts, prescription medicine, patient legal rights, and patient transition. However, there are many interfaces in the division of responsibilities among the various governmental players. CONCLUSION: eHealth is being used increasingly and in many settings, although recently published intervention studies investigating patient safety issues by the use of eHealth are limited.

IRDs were historically underserved due to lack of effective interventions. Many novel therapies will require accurate diagnosis (phenotype and genotype), thus an efficient and effective pathway for assessment and management is required. METHODS: Using surveys of existing practice patterns and advice from international experts, an all-Ireland IRD service (Target 5000) was designed. Detailed phenotyping was followed by next generation genetic sequencing in both a research and accredited laboratory. Unresolved pedigrees underwent further studies (whole gene/whole exome/whole genome sequencing). Novel variants were interrogated for pathogenicity (cascade screening, in silico analysis, functional studies). A multidisciplinary team (MDT; ophthalmologists, physicians, geneticists, genetic counsellors) reconciled phenotype with genotype. A bespoke care plan was created for each patient comprising supports, existing interventions, and novel therapies/clinical trials. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Prior to Target 5000, a significant cohort of patients were not engaged with healthcare/support services due to lack of effective interventions. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in IRD-associated genes were detected in 62.3%, with 11.6% having variants of unknown significance. The genotyping arm of Target 5000 allowed a 42.73% cost saving over independent testing, plus the value of MDT expertise/processing. Partial funding has transferred from charitable sources to government resources. CONCLUSION: Target 5000 demonstrates efficacious and efficient clinical/genetic diagnosis, while discovering novel IRD-implicated genes/variants and investigating mechanisms of disease and avenues of intervention. This model could be used to develop similar IRD programmes in small/medium-sized nations.

To date, few studies have been conducted on the effects of service quality on citizen engagement in smart cities in a public emergency. Based on the stimulus-organism-response (SOR) model and uncertain management theory, this study analyses the impact of the service quality of smart city system on citizen engagement in a public emergency. Data were collected in Chinese smart cities. Three valuable and novel results are identified. First, high-quality information content, highly reliable systems and highly responsive systems have a significant positive effect on citizens' continuous experiences, but not on citizens' immediate experiences. Second, both the immediate and continuous experiences of citizens have a significant positive effect on citizen engagement. Third, continuous experiences impose a full mediation effect between information content and citizen engagement, between reliability and citizen engagement and between responsiveness and citizen engagement. As its main contribution, this study focuses on the construction of a theoretical model. Based on this model, smart city managers can understand citizens' reactions in public emergencies from stimulation to experience and their behaviours in relation to smart city services.","Zhu, Wenlong; Yan, Ruzhen; Song, Ying",Cities,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34539020/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264275121003383; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264275121003383; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cities.2021.103439,650

Highly pathogenic coronaviruses cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (MERS-CoV) in humans. The coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infects mice and serves as an ideal model of viral pathogenesis, mainly because experiments can be conducted using animal-biosafety level-2 (A-BSL2) containment. Human thymosin beta-4 (Tβ4), a 43-residue peptide with an acetylated N-terminus, is widely expressed in human tissues. Tβ4 regulates actin polymerization and functions as an anti-inflammatory molecule and an antioxidant as well as a promoter of wound healing and angiogenesis. These activities led us to test whether Tβ4 serves to treat coronavirus infections of humans. To test this possibility, here, we established a BALB/c mouse model of coronavirus infection using mouse CoV MHV-A59 to evaluate the potential protective effect of recombinant human Tβ4 (rhTβ4). Such a system can be employed under A-BSL2 containment instead of A-BSL3 that is required to study coronaviruses infectious for humans. We found that rhTβ4 significantly increased the survival rate of mice infected with MHV-A59 through inhibiting virus replication, balancing the host's immune response, alleviating pathological damage, and promoting repair of the liver. These results will serve as the basis for further application of rhTβ4 to the treatment of human CoV diseases such as COVID-19.","Yu, Rui; Mao, Yunyun; Li, Kai; Zhai, Yanfang; Zhang, Yue; Liu, Shuling; Gao, Yuemei; Chen, Zhengshan; Liu, Yanhong; Fang, Ting; Zhao, Mengsu; Li, Ruihua; Xu, Junjie; Chen, Wei",Mediators Inflamm,https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/9979032; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33967626/,650

Patients with underlying metabolic dysfunction, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity, are at a higher risk for COVID-19 complications, including multi-organ dysfunction, secondary to a deranged immune response, and cellular energy deprivation. These patients are at a baseline state of chronic inflammation associated with increased susceptibility to the severe immune manifestations of COVID-19, which are triggered by the cellular hypoxic environment and cytokine storm. The altered metabolic profile and energy generation of immune cells affect their activation, exacerbating the imbalanced immune response. Key immunometabolic interactions may inform the development of an efficacious treatment for COVID-19. Novel therapeutic approaches with repurposed drugs, such as PPAR agonists, or newly developed molecules such as the antagomirs, which block microRNA function, have shown promising results.

Enveloped viruses contain a number of glycoprotein-type projections that are anchored in the membrane. Orthomyxoviruses, paramyxoviruses, rhabdoviruses, togaviruses, in addition to coronaviruses and arenaviruses, have such projections. The large poxviruses also have an envelope but peplomers have so far not been identified. Virus infection in cell cultures and in animals is to a large extent dependent upon the capacity of a virus to adsorb to the target cells, that is, upon the presence of receptors. When a virus is adsorbed irreversibly to the plasma membrane, parts of the virus or the whole virus is taken into the cytoplasm to initiate virus-specific protein and mRNA synthesis. The intake of adenovirus particles into cells requires a long sequence of events before mRNA synthesis can be initiated in the nucleus of the infected cell.","Philipson, Lennart",Textbook of Medical Virology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780407002531500128; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780407002531500128,650

These findings were consistent with progressive improvements in the medical care of COVID-19 patients. We further studied case mortality by hospitalization status. The case mortality rate among hospitalized patients aged 60-69 years fell significantly from the first to the third interval. During the fourth interval, an apparent rise in mortality among hospitalized patients in the same age group was mirrored by a significant decline in mortality among those not hospitalized.

Migrant careworkers work and live with populations extremely vulnerable to the novel Coronavirus, including the elderly and people with pre-existing physical conditions. This rapid assessment aimed to explore psychosocial status and mental wellbeing of migrant careworkers in Israel during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and determine risk and protective factors associated with mental distress, anxiety, and depression. METHODS: This quantitative study was conducted via an online survey. The online survey collected social and demographic data, including country of origin, residence, age, sex, and time in Israel. In addition, questions were asked about knowledge of COVID-19 guidelines, access to supplies, and COVID-related racism. Respondents also completed a psychosocial screening tools, the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-10 (HSCL-10), which was used to screen for depression and anxiety. RESULTS: As of May 3rd, 2020, 307 careworkers responded to the online survey, of whom 120 (39.1%) were found symptomatic using the HSCL-10. Separating the HSCL-10 into subscales, 28.0% were symptomatically anxious, and 38.1% were symptomatic for depression. In multivariate regression, emotional distress was associated with household food insecurity (OR: 5.85; p < 0.001), lack of confidence to care for oneself and employer during the pandemic (OR: 3.85; p < 0.001), poorer general health (OR: 2.98; p < 0.003), non-Philippine country of origin (OR: 2.83; p < 0.01), female sex (OR: 2.34; p < 0.04),, and inversely associated with age (p < 0.03). While 87.6% of careworkers reported having access to hand sanitization materials regularly, only 58.0% had regular access to a medical grade mask, and 21.5% reported household food insecurity. Moreover, 40.0% of careworkers claimed to lack confidence to care for themselves and their employer during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Migrant careworkers exhibited high levels of mental distress during the COVID-19 lockdown, associated with lack of confidence or resources to properly care for themselves and their employer.

The interaction between the ACE2 receptors at the surface of human cells and the viral Spike (S) protein triggers the infection making the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein a focal target for the neutralizing antibodies (Abs). Despite the recent progress in the development and deployment of vaccines, the emergence of novel variants of SARS-CoV-2 insensitive to Abs produced in response to the vaccine administration and/or monoclonal ones represents upcoming jeopardy. Here, we assessed the possible effects of single and multiple mutations in the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein on its binding energy to various antibodies and the human ACE2 receptor. The performed computational analysis indicates that while single amino acid replacements in RBD may only cause partial impairment of the Abs binding, moreover, limited to specific epitopes, some variants of SARS-CoV-2 (with as few as 8 mutations), which are already present in the population, may potentially result in a much broader antigenic escape. We also identified a number of point mutations, which, in contrast to the majority of replacements, reduce RBD affinity to various antibodies without affecting its binding to ACE2. Overall, the results provide guidelines for further experimental studies aiming at the identification of the high-risk RBD mutations allowing for an antigenic escape.","Bozdaganyan, Marine E.; Sokolova, Olga S.; Shaitan, Konstantin V.; Kirpichnikov, Mikhail P.; Orekhov, Philipp S.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.14.435322,650

We aimed to accelerate multiple b-value gas DW-MRI for lung morphometry using deep learning. METHODS: A deep cascade of residual dense network (DC-RDN) was developed to reconstruct high-quality DW images from highly undersampled k-space data. Hyperpolarized (129)Xe lung ventilation images were acquired from 101 participants and were retrospectively collected to generate synthetic DW-MRI data to train the DC-RDN. Afterwards, the performance of the DC-RDN was evaluated on retrospectively and prospectively undersampled multiple b-value (129)Xe MRI datasets. RESULTS: Each slice with size of 64 × 64 × 5 could be reconstructed within 7.2 ms. For the retrospective test data, the DC-RDN showed significant improvement on all quantitative metrics compared with the conventional reconstruction methods (p < 0.05). The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and morphometry parameters were not significantly different between the fully sampled and DC-RDN reconstructed images (p > 0.05). For the prospectively accelerated acquisition, the required breath-holding time was reduced from 17.8 to 4.7 s with an acceleration factor of 4. Meanwhile, the prospectively reconstructed results showed good agreement with the fully sampled images, with a mean difference of −0.72% and −0.74% regarding global mean ADC and mean linear intercept (L(m)) values. CONCLUSIONS: DC-RDN is effective in accelerating multiple b-value gas DW-MRI while maintaining accurate estimation of lung microstructural morphometry, facilitating the clinical potential of studying lung diseases with hyperpolarized DW-MRI.

This shift to more risk-averse or risk-loving behaviors may find a correlate in the individual psycho-socio-emotional profile. To this purpose, we aimed to estimate the relationship between differences in risk-taking attitudes toward possible negative health outcomes and psycho-socio-emotional dimensions modulating the experience of life-threatening situations, in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. In March 2020, we launched the PsyCovid Study (https://wprn.org/item/428452) to assess psycho-socio-emotional changes due to Covid-19 pandemic in the Italian population. Additionally, we distributed to 130 participants the Covid-19 Risk Task, including monetary and health-related stimuli, estimating a measure of risk-aversion toward health and classifying participants on the basis of their risk-attitude profiles. The set of psycho-socio-emotional variables was reduced to three PCA components: Proactivity, Isolation, Inactivity. The individual degree of risk-aversion toward negative health outcomes was directly related to Proactivity, encasing empathic, social support and positive coping strategies, which may prompt individuals to put in place self-protection strategies toward possible negative health consequences. These findings indicate that a risk-averse profile toward possible negative health outcomes may be associated to higher levels of individual prosocial and proactive dispositions, possibly making individuals' more compliant with the social and hygienic guidelines and, thus, reducing their exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Cerami, Chiara; Galandra, Caterina; Santi, Gaia Chiara; Dodich, Alessandra; Cappa, Stefano Francesco; Vecchi, Tomaso; Crespi, Chiara",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34220639/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.666454,650

How SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to lung injury remains elusive. The open reading frame 8 (ORF8) protein of SARS-CoV-2 (ORF8(SARS-CoV-2)) is a unique accessory protein, yet little is known about its cellular function. We examined the cellular distribution of ORF8(SARS-CoV-2) and its role in the regulation of human lung epithelial cell proliferation and antiviral immunity. Using live imaging and immunofluorescent staining analyses, we found that ectopically expressed ORF8(SARS-CoV-2) forms aggregates in the cytosol and nuclear compartments of lung epithelial cells. Using in silico bioinformatic analysis, we found that ORF8(SARS-CoV-2) possesses an intrinsic aggregation characteristic at its N-terminal residues 1-18. Cell culture did not reveal any effects of ORF8(SARS-CoV-2) expression on lung epithelial cell proliferation and cell cycle progression, suggesting that ORF8(SARS-CoV-2) aggregates do not affect these cellular processes. Interestingly, ectopic expression of ORF8(SARS-CoV-2) in lung epithelial cells suppressed basal expression of several antiviral molecules, including DHX58, ZBP1, MX1, and MX2. In addition, expression of ORF8(SARS-CoV-2) attenuated the induction of antiviral molecules by IFNγ but not by IFNβ in lung epithelial cells. Taken together, ORF8(SARS-CoV-2) is a unique viral accessory protein that forms aggregates when expressing in lung epithelial cells. It potently inhibits the expression of lung cellular anti-viral proteins at baseline and in response to IFNγ in lung epithelial cells, which may facilitate SARS-CoV-2 escape from the host antiviral innate immune response during early viral infection. In addition, it seems that formation of ORF8(SARS-CoV-2) aggregate is independent from the viral infection. Thus, it would be interesting to examine whether any COVID-19 patients exhibit persistent ORF8 SARS-CoV-2 expression after recovering from SARS-CoV-2 infection. If so, the pathogenic effect of prolonged ORF8(SARS-CoV-2) expression and its association with post-COVID symptoms warrant investigation in the future.","Geng, Hua; Subramanian, Saravanan; Wu, Longtao; Bu, Heng-Fu; Wang, Xiao; Du, Chao; De Plaen, Isabelle G.; Tan, Xiao-Di",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34177923/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.679482,650

Biomarkers were screened out of hematological parameters for risk stratification. Method Confirmed COVID-19 adult patients in Suzhou were included. The patient data was collected, and the results of laboratory examinations were compared between the mild/moderate and severe COVID-19 groups. A ROC was calculated to compare the diagnostic performance of candidate indexes, and dynamic levels of hematological indexes were compared between the two groups. Result 75 patients were enrolled, with a mean age of 46.6 ± 14 years, and 45 patients were male. All patients were classified into two groups: the mild/moderate group and the severe group. WBC, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), D-dimer, and fibrinogen levels of the severe group were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than the mild/moderate, and the lymphocyte was lower. The ROC test showed that the hematological parameters had a larger AUC than that of inflammatory factors. There was a significant difference in lymphocyte and fibrinogen levels between the two groups on day 1 (P < 0.05). However, NLR of the severe group was higher than the mild/moderate on days 1, 4 and 14 (P < 0.01), and so was D-dimer on days 1, 7 and 14 (P < 0.05). Conclusion The common COVID-19 abnormal hematological indexes on admission included hyperfibrinogenemia, lymphopenia, the elevation of D-dimer, and leukopenia, which were significantly different between the mild/moderate and severe COVID-19 groups. Furthermore, the dynamic change of NLR and D-dimer level can distinguish severe COVID-19 cases from the mild/moderate.","Fu, Jianhong; Kong, Jindan; Wang, Wei; Wu, Meiying; Yao, Lin; Wang, Zhaoyue; Jin, Jun; Wu, Depei; Yu, Xin",Thromb Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32407937/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049384820301699?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.thromres.2020.05.006; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0049384820301699,650

However, the precise pathomechanisms with which environmental toxicants may contribute to chronic rhinosinusitis are not fully understood. The purpose of this pilot study is to examine the cytotoxic effects of N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET), a commonly used pesticide, on sinonasal epithelial cells (SNECs). Sinus mucosa was obtained from 3 subjects without a history of chronic rhinosinusitis. Cultured SNECs were exposed to various concentrations of DEET (0-5 mM) for 6 days. Cell viability, proliferation, and morphologic changes were assessed using the MTT colorimetric dye assay and the Incucyte Live Cell Monitoring System. Statistically significant dose-dependent reduction in cell viability and proliferation was observed between exposure and control groups (P < .05) at all concentrations tested. Dose-dependent cellular morphological changes were also seen. These findings indicate that DEET exposure induces dose-dependent cytotoxicity in sinonasal epithelia.","Lee, Jivianne T.; Basak, Saroj",OTO Open,https://doi.org/10.1177/2473974x211009232; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34017935/,650

Recent reports from most frontline researchers have revealed that SARS-CoV-2 can also cause fatal non-respiratory conditions, such as fatal cardiovascular events. One of the important mechanisms underlying the multiple organ damage that is now known to occur during the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection is impairment of vascular function associated with inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. To manage the risk of vascular dysfunction-related complications in patients with COVID-19, it would be pivotal to clearly elucidate the precise mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 infects endothelial cells to cause vascular dysfunction. In this review, we summarize the current state of knowledge about the mechanisms involved in the development of vascular dysfunction in the acute phase of COVID-19.","Nakano, Hiroki; Shiina, Kazuki; Tomiyama, Hirofumi",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33920790/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22084071,650

Millions of people and businesses have been placed in lockdown where the main aim is to stop the spread of the virus. As an extreme phenomenon, the lockdown has triggered a global economic shock at an alarming pace, conveying sharp recessions for many countries. In the meantime, the lockdowns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have drastically changed energy consumption patterns and reduced CO(2) emissions throughout the world. Recent data released by the International Monetary Fund and International Energy Agency for 2020 further forecast that emissions will rebound in 2021. Still, the full impact of COVID-19 in terms of how long the crisis will be and how the consumption pattern of energy and the associated levels of CO(2) emissions will be affected are unclear. This review aims to steer policymakers and governments of nations toward a better direction by providing a broad and convincing overview on the observed and likely impacts of the pandemic of COVID-19 on the world economy, world energy demand, and world energy-related CO(2) emissions that may well emerge in the next few years.

Canada was uniquely positioned to transition to telemedicine because internationally common restrictions on abortion medication were removed before the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: We sought to characterize the experiences of abortion health care professionals in Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of the pandemic response on abortion services. METHODS: We conducted a sequential mixed methods study between July 2020 and January 2021. We invited physicians, nurse practitioners and administrators to participate in a cross-sectional survey containing an open-ended question about the impact of the pandemic response on abortion care. We employed an inductive codebook thematic analysis, which informed the development of a second, primarily quantitative survey. RESULTS: Our initial survey had 307 respondents and our second had 78. Fifty-three percent were family physicians. Our first survey found respondents considered abortion access essential. We identified three key topicss: access to abortion care was often maintained despite pandemic-related challenges (e.g. difficulty obtaining tests, additional costs); change of practice to low-touch medication abortion care and provider perceptions of patient experience, including shifting demand, telemedicine acceptability and increased rural access. The second survey indicated uptake of telemedicine medication abortion among 89% of participants except in Quebec, where regulations meant procedures were nearly exclusively surgical. Restrictions did not delay care according to 76% of participants. CONCLUSIONS: Canadian health care professionals report their facilities deemed abortion an essential service. Provinces and territories, except Quebec, described a robust pandemic transition to telemedicine to ensure access to services.

Methods We conducted a serologic survey of firefighters in Los Angeles, California, USA, in October 2020. Individuals were classified as seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 if they tested positive for immunoglobulin G, immunoglobulin M, or both. We compared demographic and contextual factors for seropositivity. Results Of 713 participants, 8.9% tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Seropositivity was not associated with gender, age, or race/ethnicity. Furthermore, firefighters who worked in zip codes with lower income or higher share of minority population did not have higher rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Seropositivity was highest among firefighters who reported working in the vicinity of Los Angeles International Airport, which had a known outbreak in July 2020. Conclusions Seroprevalence among firefighters was no higher than seroprevalence in the general population, suggesting that workplace safety protocols, such as access to PPE and testing, can mitigate increased risk of infection at work. Workplace safety protocols for firefighters also eliminated differences in disease burden by geography and race/ethnicity observed in the general population.","Mulligan, K.; Berg, A.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature evaluating the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine and its related formulations in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, MedRxiv data and Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials for published articles that reported the outcomes of COVID-19 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine or its compounds was done. We identified 1071 published studies and 7 studies were included in the analysis. RESULTS: The study population consisted of a total of 4984 patients, of which 1721 (34.5%) received hydroxychloroquine or its congeners (HCQ group) while 3091 (62.01%) received standard of care or had included antiviral medication (control group). The pooled estimate of successful treatment in the hydroxychloroquine group and the control group was 77.45% and 77.87% respectively, which indicated similar clinical outcomes in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine compared to the control group. The odds ratio of a favourable outcome with hydroxychloroquine was 1.11 (95 CI 0.72 to 1.69) (p = 0.20). The pooled risk difference of favourable outcome with hydroxychloroquine versus control group was 0.00 (95 CI -0.03 to 0.03) which was statistically not significant (p = 0.10). Conclusions: The present evidence shows no benefit of hydroxychloroquine in patients affected by mild to moderate COVID-19 disease. However, now several trials on HCQ are ongoing and hopefully more data will be available soon.

Methods We collected dates of illness onset for primary cases (infectors) and secondary cases (infectees) from published research articles and case investigation reports. We subjectively ranked the credibility of the data and performed analyses on both the full dataset (n = 28) and a subset of pairs with highest certainty in reporting (n = 18). In addition, we adjust for right truncation of the data as the epidemic is still in its growth phase. Results Accounting for right truncation and analyzing all pairs, we estimated the median serial interval at 4.0 days (95% credible interval [CrI]: 3.1, 4.9). Limiting our data to only the most certain pairs, the median serial interval was estimated at 4.6 days (95% CrI: 3.5, 5.9). Conclusions The serial interval of COVID-19 is close to or shorter than its median incubation period. This suggests that a substantial proportion of secondary transmission may occur prior to illness onset. The COVID-19 serial interval is also shorter than the serial interval of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), indicating that calculations made using the SARS serial interval may introduce bias.","Nishiura, Hiroshi; Linton, Natalie M.; Akhmetzhanov, Andrei R.",International Journal of Infectious Diseases,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971220301193; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.02.060; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32145466/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220301193,650

This study aimed to evaluate if potential steroid benefits could be predicted by the ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO(2) in mmHg) to fractional inspired oxygen (FiO(2)) (P/F) in COVID-19 patients at admission. Materials and Methods: Medical records were retrospectively collected from all adult patients admitted because of COVID-19 from 29 January to 31 July 2020. The association of steroid therapy with 28-day all-cause mortality outcome was analysed in a multivariable logistic regression model adjusted for confounding factors. Results: Overall, 511 patients were analysed, of which 39.1% underwent steroid therapy. Steroid treated patients were mostly male, older, and more frequently treated with antiviral drugs and aminoquinolines; the most common comorbidities were hypertension, followed by cardiovascular disease. Overall, 51 patients died within 28-days, and overall 28-days mortality was 19.5% in the cohort of patients exposed to steroids versus 3.9% mortality in unexposed patients (p < 0.001). Steroid therapy on patients with P/F ratio of 235 mmHg or higher at admission can be considered as detrimental, with an 8% increased probability of death. Conclusions: Steroid therapy is associated with increased 28-day mortality in COVID-19 in patients with mild or no ARDS.","Vita, Serena; Centanni, Daniele; Lanini, Simone; Piselli, Pierluca; Rosati, Silvia; Giancola, Maria Letizia; Mondi, Annalisa; Pinnetti, Carmela; Topino, Simone; Chinello, Pierangelo; Mosti, Silvia; Gualano, Gina; Faraglia, Francesca; Iacomi, Fabio; Marchioni, Luisa; Maritti, Micaela; Girardi, Enrico; Ippolito, Giuseppe; Nicastri, Emanuele",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34362021/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10153236,650
626348,Distinct Differences in the Interactions of Receptor Binding Domains of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV with Human ACE2,2021-02-12,"As ongoing Corona virus disease 2019 pandemic is ravaging the world, more and more people are following social distancing norms, avoiding unnecessary outings and preferring online shopping from the safety of their home over visiting brick and mortar stores and neighborhood shops. Although this has led to a significant reduction in chances of exposure, human-to-human interaction at the doorstep of the customer might be involved during the delivery of the ordered items. This human-to-human doorstep interaction arises in some other situations also. There is a finite probability that the person standing in front of the door coughs or sneezes during such an interaction. In this work, a three dimensional (3D) Euler–Lagrangian computational fluid dynamic model is used to understand the transmission and evaporation of micrometer-size droplets generated due to a coughing event in this setting. Different possible scenarios varying in wind direction, wind velocity, ventilation in the vicinity of door, and extent of door opening have been postulated and simulated. The results obtained from numerical simulations show that in the presence of wind, the dynamics of transmission of droplets is much faster than the dynamics of their evaporation. Thus wind velocity and direction have a significant impact on the fate of the droplets. The simulation results show that even if the door is opened by a very small degree, cough droplets enter through the door. Having open windows in the vicinity of the door on a windy day is expected to reduce the chance of the exposure significantly.","Sen, Nirvik; Singh, K.

Molecular (PCR and Sanger sequencing) methods were used to detect and genotype the investigated protist species. Carriage/infection rates were: Blastocystis sp. 9.5% (95% CI: 7.1–12.4%), G. duodenalis 2.2% (95% CI: 1.1–3.8%); and E. histolytica 2.0% (95% CI: 0.9–3.6%). Cryptosporidium spp. was not detected at all. Overall, 12.4% (95% CI: 9.7–15.6) of the participants harbored at least one enteric protist species. The most common coinfection was E. histolytica and Blastocystis sp. (1.0%; 95% CI: 0.3–2.2). Sequence analyses revealed that 90.9% (10/11) of the genotyped G. duodenalis isolates corresponded to the sub-assemblage AI. The remaining sequence (9.1%, 1/11) was identified as sub-assemblage BIV.

There is no general agreement on the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in COVID-19. In this study, we investigated NSAIDs as potential inhibitors for chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) and the main protease of the SARS-CoV-2 to find out the best candidates, which can act as potent inhibitors against the main protease. We also predicted the effect of NSAIDs on the arachidonic pathway and evaluated the hepatotoxicity of the compounds using systems biology techniques. Molecular docking was conducted via AutoDock Vina to estimate the interactions and binding affinities between selected NSAIDs and the main protease. Molecular docking results showed the presence of 10 NSAIDs based on lower binding energy (kcal/mol) toward the 3CLpro inhibition site compared to the co-crystal native ligand Inhibitor N3 (−6.6 kcal/mol). To validate the docking results, molecular dynamic (MD) simulations on the top inhibitor, Talniflumate, were performed. To obtain differentially-expressed genes under the 27 NSAIDs perturbations, we utilized the L1000 final Z-scores from the NCBI GEO repository (GSE92742). The obtained dataset included gene expression profiling signatures for 27 NSAIDs. The hepatotoxicity of NSAIDs was studied by systems biology modeling of Disturbed Metabolic Pathways. This study highlights the new application of NSAIDs as anti-viral drugs used against COVID-19. NSAIDs may also attenuate the cytokine storm through the downregulation of inflammatory mediators in the arachidonic acid pathway.","Sisakht, Mohsen; Solhjoo, Aida; Mahmoodzadeh, Amir; Fathalipour, Mohammad; Kabiri, Maryam; Sakhteman, Amirhossein",Comput Biol Med,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0010482521004807; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010482521004807?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34340125/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2021.104686,650

The main goal of the present study was to analyse the influence of different cold pressed oils and aromatic herbs during marination process on the nutritional, textural, and sensory attributes of the final grilled sirloin samples. In order to fulfil this goal, methods like GC-MS, HPLC/DAD/ESI-MS, HLPC-RID were performed to quantify fatty acids, phenolic acids, and organic acids, respectively. Textural and sensory analysis were performed with CT 3 Texture Analyser and hedonic test. The results showed high improvement of the meat grilled samples regarding the content of phenolic acids, and textural and sensory characteristics. Pearson values indicate strong positive correlations between raw and grilled samples regarding their content in phenolic acids. Hardness, chewiness, gumminess decreased during marination, meanwhile, resilience, and cohesiveness increased. Sensory analysis highlighted that meat samples marinated with olive oil and rosemary for 120 h reached the highest hedonic score among the tested samples.","Vişan, Vasile-Gheorghe; Chiş, Maria Simona; Păucean, Adriana; Mureșan, Vlad; Pușcaș, Andreea; Stan, Laura; Vodnar, Dan Cristian; Dulf, Francisc Vasile; Țibulcă, Dorin; Vlaic, Bogdan Alin; Rusu, Iulian Eugen; Kadar, Csaba Balasz; Vlaic, Augustin",Foods,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34574122/; https://doi.org/10.3390/foods10092012,650

Amazonian students were among the high-interest group and would like to study more deeply local living beings, contrary to the tendency to favor large exotic animals in Brazilian biology curricula. Students from the southeast were grouped in the low-interest group. However, students from both regions agree upon the urgent need for actions to protect the environment and strongly disagree that this is a role expected from rich countries only.

The mortality rate for MERS is about 34.5%. Due to its high mortality rate, the lack of therapeutic and prophylactic agents, and the continuing threat of the spread of MERS beyond its current confines, developing a vaccine is a pressing task, because vaccination would help limit the spread of MERS and reduce its death toll. We have developed a combined vector vaccine for the prevention of MERS based on recombinant human adenovirus serotypes 26 and 5. Studies of its immunogenicity have shown that vaccination of animals (mice and primates) induces a robust humoral immune response that lasts for at least six months. Studies of the cellular immune response in mice after vaccination showed the emergence of a specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell response. A study of the vaccine protectivity conducted in a model of transgenic mice carrying the human DPP4 receptor gene showed that our vaccination protected 100% of the animals from the lethal infection caused by the MERS-CoV virus (MERS-CoV EMC/2012, 100LD(50) per mouse). Studies of the safety and tolerability of the developed vaccine in rodents, rabbits, and primates showed a good safety profile and tolerance in animals; they revealed no contraindications for clinical testing.","Dolzhikova, I.

A key aspect of the transformation has been increased digitalization and the accelerated implementation of previously predicted trends that have been discussed for many years in the information management literature. Human endeavour has encouraged us to adapt to the “new normal” through immediate necessity in areas such as work, education, healthcare, entertainment and leisure, and online commerce. This new environment has provided unprecedented opportunities for the information management research community to develop research that will have a significant impact on practice in these and other areas. We are essentially at the pinnacle of new developments in the digital space and must seek to develop exemplars that can help to signpost the future direction of digital global society for the benefit of all. Notwithstanding, the problems of digitalization have also been exacerbated and must be further understood and ameliorated in the post-COVID world.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A search string was developed with the aid of a scientific librarian and the search was performed in PubMed, CINAHL and Embase. The studies were screened independently by two authors using Covidence. Data were extracted by two authors and quality assessment was performed using Robins-I tool. The meta-analyses were performed in STATA IC 16 using Risk Ratio as the primary effect estimate. RESULTS: In total, 617 studies were screened and ten studies were included with a total of 3,131 patients. The mean age ranged from 68.3 to 85.0 years and the prevalence of posterior tilt ≥20° in the studies ranged from 4.5% to 27.6%. There were 10.3% reoperations when posterior tilt was <20° whereas there were 24.5% when posterior tilt was ≥20° The meta-analysis therefore demonstrated an overall risk ratio of 0.11 (95% confidence interval; 0.04-0.18). Only one study investigated functional outcome, using ADL as measurement, but found no significant difference. No studies investigated PROM. In general, the studies were assessed to be of poor quality mainly due possible bias and confounding. CONCLUSION: A posterior tilt ≥20° leads to a higher risk of reoperations in uFNF. Even though the studies were of poor quality, the results suggest that we should include the measurement of posterior tilt in national guidelines.","Nielsen, Line L; Smidt, Nanna S; Erichsen, Julie L; Palm, Henrik; Viberg, Bjarke",Injury,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.injury.2020.09.033; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32980140/,650

As more countries control the epidemic, the resumption of work is imperative. However, asymptomatic carriers become the main source of infection. After several months of recovery, Wuhan had much experience with facing the challenge of work resumption. The purpose of this study was to investigate the safety of the resumption strategies, as well as the outcome of the resumption efforts, in the early post-epidemic period. A retrospective study was conducted in patients admitted between April 8 and June 30 to the neurosurgery department of Tongji Hospital, Wuhan. The medical information, past medical history, COVID-19 tests, laboratory parameters, CT results, and management were reviewed and recorded. 768 patients were admitted to the neurosurgery department at Tongji Hospital, and none of them became new infections. Our department recovered to 70% efficiency one month after the resumption of work. Two patients were found to have asymptomatic infections in the outpatient department. Two patients who recovered from COVID-19 underwent the surgery without recurrence of COVID-19. Tumor patients accounted for more than 50% of the surgery patients in the early period. It is feasible and helpful to follow our strict admission algorithm in the early post-epidemic period, even though the challenges of asymptomatic infectors exist. Two COVID-19 tests in 3 days are suggested within the early period. Protective downgrades should be based on the testing of asymptomatic patients in the area. Recovered COVID-19 patients can undergo surgery without recurrence.","Qi, Yiwei; Liu, Xiaojin; Wan, Xueyan; Lu, Liang; Hu, Feng; Qi, Chunxia; Zhao, Kai; Shu, Kai; Lei, Ting",Neurosurg Rev,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10143-021-01531-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33839945/,650

There were over 4.8 million confirmed cases and about 320,000 deaths as of May 19, 2020 in the world. We examined the characteristics of the confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19 in all affected counties of the United States. We proposed a COVID-Net combining the architecture of both Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) by using the trajectories of COVID-19 during different periods until May 19, 2020, as the training data. The validation of the COVID-Net was performed by predicting the numbers of confirmed cases and deaths in subsequent 3-day, 5-day, and 7-day periods. The COVID-Net produced relatively smaller Mean Relative Errors (MREs) for the 10 counties with the most severe epidemic as of May 19, 2020. On average, MREs were 0.01 for the number of confirmed cases in all validation periods, and 0.01, 0.01, and 0.03 for the number of deaths in the 3-day, 5-day, and 7-day periods, respectively. The COVID-Net incorporated five risk factors of COVID-19 and was used to predict the trajectories of COVID-19 in Hudson County, New Jersey and New York County, New York until June 28, 2020. The risk factors include the percentage of the population with access to exercise opportunities, average daily PM2.5, population size, preventable hospitalization rate, and violent crime rate. The expected number of cumulative confirmed cases and deaths depends on the dynamics of these five risk factors.","Tian, T.; Jiang, Y.; Zhang, Y.; Li, Z.; Wang, X.; Zhang, H.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.26.20113787; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.26.20113787v1?rss=1,650
629889,Will SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern affect the promise of vaccines?,2021-04-29,"“COVID-19” is the word that certainly isn’t forgotten by everybody who lives in the first half of the twenty-first century. COVID-19, as a pandemic, has led many researchers from different biomedical fields to find solutions or treatments to manage the pandemic. However, no standard treatment for this disease has been discovered to date. Probably, preventing the severe acute respiratory infection form of COVID-19 as the most dangerous phase of this disease can be helpful for the treatment and reduction of the death rate. In this regard, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)-based immunomodulation treatment has been proposed as a suitable therapeutic approach and several clinical trials have begun. Recently, MSCs according to their immunomodulatory and regenerative properties attract attention in clinical trials. After the intravenous transplantation of MSCs, a significant population of cells accumulates in the lung, which they alongside immunomodulatory effect could protect alveolar epithelial cells, reclaim the pulmonary microenvironment, prevent pulmonary fibrosis, and cure lung dysfunction. Given the uncertainties in this area, we reviewed reported clinical trials and hypotheses to provide useful information to researchers and those interested in stem cell therapy. In this study, we considered this new approach to improve patient’s immunological responses to COVID-19 using MSCs and discussed the aspects of this proposed treatment. However, currently, there are no approved MSC-based approaches for the prevention and/or treatment of COVID-19 patients but clinical trials ongoing.","Golchin, Ali; Seyedjafari, Ehsan; Ardeshirylajimi, Abdolreza",Stem Cell Rev Rep,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12015-020-09973-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32281052/,650

Current gold standard nucleic acid tests are hampered by supply shortages in critical reagents including nasal swabs, RNA extraction kits, personal protective equipment, instrumentation, and labor. METHODS: To overcome these challenges, we developed a rapid colorimetric assay using reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) optimized on human saliva samples without an RNA purification step. We describe the optimization of saliva pretreatment protocols to enable analytically sensitive viral detection by RT-LAMP. We optimized the RT-LAMP reaction conditions and implemented high-throughput unbiased methods for assay interpretation. We tested whether saliva pretreatment could also enable viral detection by conventional reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Finally, we validated these assays on clinical samples. RESULTS: The optimized saliva pretreatment protocol enabled analytically sensitive extraction-free detection of SARS-CoV-2 from saliva by colorimetric RT-LAMP or RT-qPCR. In simulated samples, the optimized RT-LAMP assay had a limit of detection of 59 (95% confidence interval: 44-104) particle copies per reaction. We highlighted the flexibility of LAMP assay implementation using three readouts: naked-eye colorimetry, spectrophotometry, and real-time fluorescence. In a set of 30 clinical saliva samples, colorimetric RT-LAMP and RT-qPCR assays performed directly on pretreated saliva samples without RNA extraction had accuracies greater than 90%. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid and extraction-free detection of SARS-CoV-2 from saliva by colorimetric RT-LAMP is a simple, sensitive, and cost-effective approach with broad potential to expand diagnostic testing for the virus causing COVID-19.","Lalli, Matthew A; Langmade, S Joshua; Chen, Xuhua; Fronick, Catrina C; Sawyer, Christopher S; Burcea, Lauren C; Wilkinson, Michael N; Fulton, Robert S; Heinz, Michael; Buchser, William J; Head, Richard D; Mitra, Robi D; Milbrandt, Jeffrey",Clin Chem,https://doi.org/10.1093/clinchem/hvaa267; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33098427/,650

A number of patients who are COVID positive have reported oral lesions. However, there is still a lingering question, whether these lesions are because of coronavirus infection or they are secondary to the patient’s systemic condition. This article aims to report the oral findings of an observational study of 713 patients diagnosed with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A singlssswe-institution, short-term observational study was conducted on patients admitted to Symbiosis University Hospital and Research Centre, Lavale, Pune who were positive to coronavirus, who presented varied oral findings such as herpes simplex, candidiasis, geographic tongue, and aphthous ulcer. RESULTS: A total of 713 patients, 416 males and 297 females, who were positive to coronavirus, were screened from April 2020 to June 30, 2020, for oral ulcers. In this group, nine patients reported oral discomfort due to varied forms of oral lesions ranging from herpes simplex ulcers to angular cheilitis (1.26%). CONCLUSION: This study supports the hypothesis that oral manifestations in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 could be secondary lesions resulting from local irritants or from the deterioration of systemic health or could be just coexisting conditions. No specific pattern or characteristic oral lesions were noted in a study of 713 COVID-positive patients in our study to qualify these lesions as oral manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Subramaniam, Tulsi; Nikalje, Monali R.; Jadhav, Sameer",Dent Res J (Isfahan),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34584645/,650

DESIGN: Cross-sectional staff survey. SETTING: All staff grades and types across primary and secondary care in a single National Health Service organisation. PARTICIPANTS: 257 staff members completed the survey, 251 had a work-related burnout score and 239 records were used in the regression analysis. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: (1) Work-related burnout as measured by the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory; (2) factors associated with work-related burnout identified through a multiple linear regression model; and (3) factors associated with work-related burnout identified through thematic analysis of free text responses. RESULTS: After adjusting for other covariates (including age, sex, job, being able to take breaks and COVID-19 knowledge), we observed meaningful changes in work-related burnout associated with having different COVID-19 roles (p=0.03), differences in the ability to rest and recover during breaks (p<0.01) and having personal protective equipment concerns (p=0.04). Thematic analysis of the free text comments also linked burnout to changes in workload and responsibility and to a lack of control through redeployment and working patterns. Reduction in non-COVID-19 services has resulted in some members of staff feeling underutilised, with feelings of inequality in workload. CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses support anecdotal reports of staff struggling with the additional pressures brought on by COVID-19. All three of the factors we found to be associated with work-related burnout are modifiable and hence their effects can be mitigated. When we next find ourselves in extraordinary times the ordinary considerations of rest and protection and monitoring of the impact of new roles will be more important than ever.","Gemine, Rachel; Davies, Gareth R; Tarrant, Suzanne; Davies, Richard M; James, Meryl; Lewis, Keir",BMJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33509850/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-042591,650

Analyses were based on data from the “German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents” study during 2014–2017 (n = 6599). Changes in WP use prevalence compared with 2009–2012 were used to describe trends. Associations with sociodemographic characteristics and cigarette smoking were assessed with multivariable logistic regression models. Prevalence of current WP use among adolescents was 8.5% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 7.5–9.6), use in the last 12 months was 19.7% (95% CI = 18.3–21.2), and ever use was 25.8% (95% CI = 24.2–27.5). High prevalence rates were particularly found among 16–17-year-olds. During 2009–2012, these prevalence rates were 9.0%, 18.5%, and 26.1%, respectively. WP use was associated with older age, male sex, migration background, lower educational level, and current smoking status. Among current WP users, 66.2% (95% CI = 60.0–71.9) identified themselves as non-smokers, and 38.1% (95% CI = 32.5–44.0) had used WP ≥ three times in the last month.

The potentially far-reaching side effects of these measures have not yet been fully understood. In this study we analyse the results of a multi-country survey conducted in Italy (N = 3,504), Spain (N = 3,524) and the United Kingdom (N = 3,523), with two separate analyses. In the first analysis, we examine the elicitation of citizens’ concerns over the downplaying of the economic consequences of the lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic. We control for Social Desirability Bias through a list experiment included in the survey. In the second analysis, we examine the data from the same survey to predict the level of stress, anxiety and depression associated with being economically vulnerable and having been affected by a negative economic shock. To accomplish this, we have used a prediction algorithm based on machine learning techniques. To quantify the size of this affected population, we compare its magnitude with the number of people affected by COVID-19 using measures of susceptibility, vulnerability and behavioural change collected in the same questionnaire. We find that the concern for the economy and for “the way out” of the lockdown is diffuse and there is evidence of minor underreporting. Additionally, we estimate that around 42.8% of the populations in the three countries are at high risk of stress, anxiety, and depression, based on their level of economic vulnerability and their exposure to a negative economic shock.","Codagnone, Cristiano; Bogliacino, Francesco; Gómez, Camilo; Charris, Rafael; Montealegre, Felipe; Liva, Giovanni; Lupiáñez-Villanueva, Francisco; Folkvord, Frans; Veltri, Giuseppe A.",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0240876; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33108374/,650

MATERIAL AND METHOD: The sample of this descriptive study consisted of 160 news articles published between 11 March and 11 April 2020 on the websites of the three highest-circulating newspapers throughout the nation. A quantitative media context analysis method, consisting of 14 questions and 2 sections was employed to evaluate news on the newspapers. The data was analyzed using SPSS 21.0 statistical package program using numbers and percentages. RESULTS: Forty percent of the news analyzed within the scope of the study were obtained from the newspaper’s own news, reporter or columnist, 56.9% were informative, 6.3% were advisory and critical against the CAT methods. 95% of the news included preventive or protective methods against COVID-19. 77.5% of the complementary and alternative medicine methods mentioned in the news were biologically-based, 20.6% were mind-body practices. It was determined that 85.0% of the benefits, harm and side effects of the methods mentioned in the news were announced, but their impact on COVID-19 is not clarified (78.1%), and there was insufficient information provided about the method and dosage of the method. It was seen that all news contained information on protection against COVID-19 or prevention of COVID19. CONCLUSION: It was concluded that the sources and methods and the number of news items changed from one newspaper to another, the news lacked a scientific basis, and as a result, it might lead to misinterpretations among the public. There were different opinions among the experts in the proposed or criticized complementary and alternative medicine methods. It was observed that there was an increase in the number of news items related to using complementary and alternative medicine methods for the treatment of COVID19, a clear and easily understandable language was used in the news, but the content and sources of the news were insufficient in conveying the correct and scientific information.

635450,Detection and Genome Sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 in a Domestic Cat with Respiratory Signs in Switzerland,2021-03-17,"Regions with insufficient vaccination have hindered worldwide poliomyelitis eradication, as they are vulnerable to sporadic outbreaks through reintroduction of the disease. Despite Israel’s having been declared polio-free in 1988, a routine sewage surveillance program detected polio in 2013. To curtail transmission, the Israel Ministry of Health launched a vaccine campaign to vaccinate children—who had only received the inactivated polio vaccine—with the oral polio vaccine (OPV). Determining the degree of prosocial motivation in vaccination behavior is challenging because vaccination typically provides direct benefits to the individual as well as indirect benefits to the community by curtailing transmission. However, the Israel OPV campaign provides a unique and excellent opportunity to quantify and model prosocial vaccination as its primary objective was to avert transmission. Using primary survey data and a game-theoretical model, we examine and quantify prosocial behavior during the OPV campaign. We found that the observed vaccination behavior in the Israeli OPV campaign is attributable to prosocial behavior and heterogeneous perceived risk of paralysis based on the individual’s comprehension of the prosocial nature of the campaign. We also found that the benefit of increasing comprehension of the prosocial nature of the campaign would be limited if even 24% of the population acts primarily from self-interest, as greater vaccination coverage provides no personal utility to them. Our results suggest that to improve coverage, communication efforts should also focus on alleviating perceived fears surrounding the vaccine.","Wells, Chad R.; Huppert, Amit; Fitzpatrick, Meagan C.; Pandey, Abhishek; Velan, Baruch; Singer, Burton H.; Bauch, Chris T.; Galvani, Alison P.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32457142/; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1922746117,650

The need is not only to integrate multiple data streams from different sources, scales, and cadences, but to also identify meaningful spatial patterns in these data, especially in vulnerable settings where even small numbers and low rates are important to pinpoint for early intervention. This paper identifies a gap in current analytical approaches and presents a near-real time assessment of emergent disease that can be used to guide a local intervention strategy: Geographic Monitoring for Early Disease Detection (GeoMEDD). Through integration of a spatial database and two types of clustering algorithms, GeoMEDD uses incoming test data to provide multiple spatial and temporal perspectives on an ever changing disease landscape by connecting cases using different spatial and temporal thresholds. GeoMEDD has proven effective in revealing these different types of clusters, as well as the influencers and accelerators that give insight as to why a cluster exists where it does, and why it evolves, leading to the saving of lives through more timely and geographically targeted intervention.","Curtis, Andrew; Ajayakumar, Jayakrishnan; Curtis, Jacqueline; Mihalik, Sarah; Purohit, Maulik; Scott, Zachary; Muisyo, James; Labadorf, James; Vijitakula, Sorapat; Yax, Justin; Goldberg, Daniel W.",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33303896/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-78704-5,650

In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the major form of dementia, β-amyloid (Aβ) levels in the blood are increased; however, the impact of elevated Aβ levels on the progression of COVID-19 remains largely unknown. Here, our findings demonstrate that Aβ(1-42), but not Aβ(1-40), bound to various viral proteins with a preferentially high affinity for the spike protein S1 subunit (S1) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the viral receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). These bindings were mainly through the C-terminal residues of Aβ(1-42). Furthermore, Aβ(1-42) strengthened the binding of the S1 of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 and increased the viral entry and production of IL-6 in a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection model. Intriguingly, data from a surrogate mouse model with intravenous inoculation of Aβ(1-42) show that the clearance of Aβ(1-42) in the blood was dampened in the presence of the extracellular domain of the spike protein trimers of SARS-CoV-2, whose effects can be prevented by a novel anti-Aβ antibody. In conclusion, these findings suggest that the binding of Aβ(1-42) to the S1 of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 may have a negative impact on the course and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further investigations are warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and examine whether reducing the level of Aβ(1-42) in the blood is beneficial to the fight against COVID-19 and AD.","Hsu, John Tsu-An; Tien, Chih-Feng; Yu, Guann-Yi; Shen, Santai; Lee, Yi-Hsuan; Hsu, Pei-Chien; Wang, Yun; Chao, Po-Kuan; Tsay, Huey-Jen; Shie, Feng-Shiun",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22158226; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34360989/,650

We assess the effects of biological variables on basal temperature and temperature in COVID-19 infection, proposing an updated temperature threshold for older adults. Methods: Participants: a) Unaffected twin volunteers: 1089 adult TwinsUK participants. b) London hospitalised COVID-19+: 520 adults with emergency admission. c) Birmingham hospitalised COVID-19+: 757 adults with emergency admission. d) Community-based COVID-19+: 3972 adults self-reporting a positive test using the COVID Symptom Study mobile application. Analysis: Heritability assessed using saturated and univariate ACE models: Linear mixed-effect and multivariable linear regression analysing associations between temperature, age, sex and BMI; multivariable logistic regression analysing associations between fever (>=37.8degC) and age; receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to identify temperature threshold for adults >=65 years. Results: Among unaffected volunteers, lower BMI (p=0.001), and older age (p<0.001) associated with lower basal temperature. Basal temperature showed a heritability of 47% (95% Confidence Interval 18-57%). In COVID-19+ participants, increasing age associated with lower temperatures in cohorts (c) and (d) (p<0.001). For each additional year of age, participants were 1% less likely to demonstrate a fever (OR 0.99; p<0.001). Combining healthy and COVID-19+ participants, a temperature of 37.4degC in adults >=65 years had similar sensitivity and specificity to 37.8degC in adults <65 years for discriminating fever in COVID-19. Conclusions: Ageing affects temperature in health and acute infection. Significant heritability indicates biological factors contribute to temperature regulation.

While it is known that uncontrolled HIV infection is a major risk factor for the development of TB, the effect of underlying LTBI on HIV disease progression is less well characterized, in part because longitudinal data are lacking. We sorted all participants of the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) with at least 1 documented MTB test into one of the 3 groups: MTB uninfected, LTBI, or active TB. To detect differences in the HIV set point viral load (SPVL), linear regression was used; the frequency of the most common opportunistic infections (OIs) in the SHCS between MTB uninfected patients, patients with LTBI, and patients with active TB were compared using logistic regression and time-to-event analyses. In adjusted models, we corrected for baseline demographic characteristics, i.e., HIV transmission risk group and gender, geographic region, year of HIV diagnosis, and CD4 nadir. A total of 13,943 SHCS patients had at least 1 MTB test documented, of whom 840 (6.0%) had LTBI and 770 (5.5%) developed active TB. Compared to MTB uninfected patients, LTBI was associated with a 0.24 decreased log HIV SPVL in the adjusted model (p < 0.0001). Patients with LTBI had lower odds of having candida stomatitis (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 0.68, p = 0.0035) and oral hairy leukoplakia (adjusted OR = 0.67, p = 0.033) when compared to MTB uninfected patients. The association of LTBI with a reduced HIV set point virus load and fewer unrelated infections in HIV/TB coinfected patients suggests a more complex interaction between LTBI and HIV than previously assumed.","Kusejko, Katharina; Günthard, Huldrych F.; Olson, Gregory S.; Zens, Kyra; Darling, Katharine; Khanna, Nina; Furrer, Hansjakob; Vetter, Pauline; Bernasconi, Enos; Vernazza, Pietro; Hoffmann, Matthias; Kouyos, Roger D.; Nemeth, Johannes",PLoS Biol,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000963; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33284802/,650

MAIN TEXT: In our attempt to merge clinical and public health ethics, we empirically compared the individual and collective health consequences of two illustrative lists of medical and public health ethical tenets and discussed their reciprocal relevance to praxis. : fleshing out three similar principles, namely, beneficence, medical and public health engagement in favour of health equality, and community and individual participation; and adopting three stand-alone principles, namely, professional excellence, non-maleficence, and scientific excellence. Finally, we suggest that eco-biopsychosocial and patient-centred care delivery and dual clinical/public health practice should become a doctor’s moral obligation. We propose to call ethics based on non-maleficence, beneficence, autonomy, and justice – the values upon which, according to Pellegrino and Thomasma, the others are grounded and that physicians and ethicists use to resolve ethical dilemmas – “neo-Hippocratic”. The neo- prefix is justified by the adjunct of a distributive dimension (justice) to traditional Hippocratic ethics. CONCLUSION: Ethical codes ought to be constantly updated. The above values do not escape the rule. We have formulated them to feed discussions in health services and medical associations. Not only are these values fragmentary and in progress, but they have no universal ambition: they are applicable to the dilemmas of modern Western medicine only, not Ayurvedic or Shamanic medicine, because each professional culture has its own philosophical rationale. Efforts to combine clinical and public health ethics whilst resolving medical dilemmas can reasonably be expected to call upon the physician’s professional identity because they are intellectual challenges to be associated with case management.","Unger, Jean-Pierre; Morales, Ingrid; De Paepe, Pierre; Roland, Michel",BMC Health Serv Res,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-020-05887-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33292217/,650

In mouse models, variation in the Oas1b gene influences host susceptibility to flavivirus infection. However, the impact of Oas variation on overall innate immune programming and global gene expression among tissues and in different genetic backgrounds has not been defined. We examined how Oas1b acts in spleen and brain tissue to limit West Nile virus (WNV) susceptibility and disease across a range of genetic backgrounds. The laboratory founder strains of the mouse Collaborative Cross (CC) (A/J, C57BL/6J, 129S1/SvImJ, NOD/ShiLtJ, and NZO/HlLtJ) all encode a truncated, defective Oas1b, whereas the three wild-derived inbred founder strains (CAST/EiJ, PWK/PhJ, and WSB/EiJ) encode a full-length OAS1B protein. We assessed disease profiles and transcriptional signatures of F1 hybrids derived from these founder strains. F1 hybrids included wild-type Oas1b (F/F), homozygous null Oas1b (N/N), and heterozygous offspring of both parental combinations (F/N and N/F). These mice were challenged with WNV, and brain and spleen samples were harvested for global gene expression analysis. We found that the Oas1b haplotype played a role in WNV susceptibility and disease metrics, but the presence of a functional Oas1b allele in heterozygous offspring did not absolutely predict protection against disease. Our results indicate that Oas1b status as wild-type or truncated, and overall Oas1b gene dosage, link with novel innate immune gene signatures that impact specific biological pathways for the control of flavivirus infection and immunity through both Oas1b-dependent and independent processes.","Green, Richard; Wilkins, Courtney; Thomas, Sunil; Sekine, Aimee; Hendrick, Duncan M.; Voss, Kathleen; Ireton, Renee C.; Mooney, Michael; Go, Jennifer T.; Choonoo, Gabrielle; Jeng, Sophia; de Villena, Fernando Pardo-Manuel; Ferris, Martin T.; McWeeney, Shannon; Gale, Michael",G3 (Bethesda),https://doi.org/10.1534/g3.117.041624; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28592649/,650

A number of enteroviruses, including echoviruses (EV) and group B coxsackieviruses (CVB), initiate infection by attaching to decay-accelerating factor (DAF), a molecule that is highly expressed on the apical surface of polarized epithelial cells. We previously observed that entry of DAF-binding CVB3 into polarized intestinal epithelial cells occurs by an unusual endocytic mechanism that requires caveolin but does not involve clathrin or dynamin. Here we examined the entry of a DAF-binding echovirus, EV7. We found that drugs, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), and dominant negative mutants that target factors required for clathrin-mediated endocytosis, including clathrin and dynamin, inhibited both EV7 infection and internalization of virions from the cell surface. Once virus had entered the cell, it colocalized with markers of early endosomes (EEA1) and then late endosomes (LAMP-2). Inhibition of endosomal maturation—with siRNAs or dominant negative mutants targeting Rab5 and Rab7—inhibited infection and prevented release of viral RNA into the cell. These results indicate that EV7 is internalized by clathrin-mediated endocytosis and then moves to early and late endosomes before releasing its RNA. Trafficking through endosomes is known to be important for viruses that depend on low pH or endosomal cathepsin proteases to complete the entry process. However, we found that EV7 infection required neither low pH nor cathepsins.","Kim, Chonsaeng; Bergelson, Jeffrey M.",mBio,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22496312/; https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00304-11,650

Objective: To track the early course of the pandemic by examining self-reported COVID symptoms over time before testing became widely available. Design: Adults from the nationally representative Angus Reid Forum were randomly invited to complete an online survey in May/June 2020. The study is a part of the Action to Beat Coronavirus antibody testing study. Setting: A 20-item internet survey. Participants: 14,408 adults age 18 years of age. Exposures: The months that respondents and any household members first experienced various respiratory, neurological, sleep, skin or gastric symptoms. Main Outcomes and Measure: COVID symptom-positive, defined as fever (or fever with hallucinations) plus at least one of difficulty breathing, a dry severe cough, loss of smell or COVID toe. Results: In total, 14,408 panel members (48% male and 52% female) completed the survey. Despite overrepresentation of higher levels of education, the prevalence of obesity, smoking, diabetes and hypertension were similar to national census and health surveys. A total of 811 (5.6%) were COVID symptom-positive; highest rates were at ages 18-44 years (8.3% among), declining at older ages. Females had higher odds of reporting COVID symptoms (OR = 1.32, 95%CI 1.11-1.56) as did visible minorities (OR = 1.74, 1.29-2.35). COVID symptom positivity for respondents and their household members peaked in March (OR = 1.93, 95% CI = 1.59-2.34 compared to earlier months).

The fatal consequences of the pandemic have been clearly reported, with direct and indirect effects; however, there is some evidence of a positive secondary impact, such as fewer motor accidents, lower influenza burden and reduced air pollution. METHODS/MODEL: We present a model to describe the differing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mortality, taking into account external pressures and internal resources and their relationship with resilience and health behaviors, which affect mortality risk, inspired by elements of the salutogenic model. Individuals with lower resources and from more deprived communities are likely to be more negatively affected by the external changes occurring, while those with more resources may be more likely to experience the benefits. Both individual and community resources affect coping and influence both mental and physical health. CONCLUSIONS: Decision makers should consider ways to incorporate the positive changes which occurred as part of the exit strategy. Societies should invest in building resources to improve both individual and community resilience to help people be better prepared and more able to cope and adapt in times of crisis. Special emphasis should be given to weaker populations most affected by external changes, including older people, low socioeconomic groups, those with mental health issues and minority groups, in order to reduce disparities.","Saban, Mor; Myers, Vicki; Luxenburg, Osnat; Wilf-Miron, Rachel",Int J Equity Health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12939-021-01470-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34134710/,650

At time of writing, positive detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus remains the only method for diagnosing COVID-19 infection. Rapid upscaling of national SARS-CoV-2 genome testing presented challenges: 1) Unpredictable supply chains of reagents and kits for virus inactivation, RNA extraction and PCR-detection of viral genomes 2) Rapid time to result of <24 hours is required in order to facilitate timely infection control measures. We evaluated whether alternative commercially available kits provided sensitivity and accuracy of SARS-CoV-2 genome detection comparable to those used by regional National Healthcare Services (NHS), and asked if detection was altered by heat inactivation, an approach for rapid one-step viral inactivation and RNA extraction without chemicals or kits. Using purified RNA, we found the CerTest VIASURE kit to be comparable to Altona RealStar system currently in use, and further showed that both diagnostic kits performed similarly in the BioRad CFX96 and Roche LightCycler 480 II machines. Additionally, both kits were comparable to a third alternative using a combination of Quantabio qScript 1-step qRT-PCR mix and CDC-accredited N1 and N2 primer/probes when looking specifically at borderline samples. Importantly, when using the kits in an extraction-free protocol, following heat inactivation, we saw differing results, with the combined Quantabio-CDC assay showing superior accuracy and sensitivity. In particular, detection using the CDC N2 probe following the extraction-free protocol was highly correlated to results generated with the same probe following RNA extraction and reported clinically (n=127; R2=0.9259). Our results demonstrate that sample treatment can greatly affect the downstream performance of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic kits, with varying impact depending on the kit. We also showed that one-step heat inactivation methods could reduce time from swab receipt to outcome of test result. Combined, these findings present alternatives to the protocols in use and can serve to alleviate any arising supply chain issues at different points in the workflow, whilst accelerating testing, and reducing cost and environmental impact.","Thompson, J.

This path has three key steps: (1) pursuing immediate improvements in the ACA that are tangible and traceable yet do not work against the eventual creation of a public option; (2) building the necessary policy foundations for a public option, while encouraging progressive states to experiment with state public plan models; and (3) seeding and strengthening movements to press for more fundamental reform.","Hacker, Jacob S","Journal of health politics, policy and law",https://doi.org/10.1215/03616878-8970739; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33493271/,650

YouTube has been recognized as a popular source of information in previous disease outbreaks. We analyzed the content on YouTube about n-CoV in English and Mandarin languages. METHODS: YouTube was searched using the terms ‘2019 novel coronavirus’, ‘Wuhan virus’ and ‘武汉病毒’ (Mandarin for Wuhan virus) on 1st and 2nd February 2020. First 50 videos in each group were analyzed. Videos in other languages, duplicate videos, those without an audio and duration >15 min were excluded .72 videos in English and 42 in Mandarin were reviewed. 2 reviewers classified the videos as useful, misleading or news based on pre specified criterion. Inter-observer agreement was evaluated with kappa coefficient. Modified DISCERN index for reliability and medical information and content index (MICI) score were used for content analysis. RESULTS: These videos attracted cumulative 21,288,856 views. 67% of English and 50% Mandarin videos had useful information. The viewership of misleading Mandarin videos was higher than the useful ones. WHO accounted for only 4% of useful videos. Mean DISCERN score for reliability was 3.12/5 and 3.25/5 for English and Mandarin videos respectively. Mean cumulative MICI score of useful videos was low (6.71/25 for English and 6.28/25 for Mandarin). CONCLUSIONS: YouTube viewership during 2019 n-CoV outbreak is higher than previous outbreaks. The medical content of videos is suboptimal International health agencies are underrepresented. Given its popularity, YouTube should be considered as important platform for information dissemination.","Khatri, Priyanka; Singh, Shweta R; Belani, Neeta Kesu; Yeong, Yin Leng; Lohan, Rahul; Lim, Yee Wei; Teo, Winnie ZY",Travel Med Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101636; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1477893920301046; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1477893920301046; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32205267/,650
639524,Correction to: Adaptive immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection in severe versus mild individuals,2021-04-19,"[Image: see text] The rapidly growing COVID-19 pandemic is the most serious global health crisis since the “Spanish flu” of 1918. There is currently no proven effective drug treatment or prophylaxis for this coronavirus infection. While developing safe and effective vaccines is one of the key focuses, a number of existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated for their potency and efficiency against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and in the clinic. Here, we review the significant potential of nitazoxanide (NTZ) as an antiviral agent that can be repurposed as a treatment for COVID-19. Originally, NTZ was developed as an antiparasitic agent especially against Cryptosporidium spp.; it was later shown to possess potent activity against a broad range of both RNA and DNA viruses, including influenza A, hepatitis B and C, and coronaviruses. Recent in vitro assessment of NTZ has confirmed its promising activity against SARS-CoV-2 with an EC(50) of 2.12 μM. Here we examine its drug properties, antiviral activity against different viruses, clinical trials outcomes, and mechanisms of antiviral action from the literature in order to highlight the therapeutic potential for the treatment of COVID-19. Furthermore, in preliminary PK/PD analyses using clinical data reported in the literature, comparison of simulated TIZ (active metabolite of NTZ) exposures at two doses with the in vitro potency of NTZ against SARS-CoV-2 gives further support for drug repurposing with potential in combination chemotherapy approaches. The review concludes with details of second generation thiazolides under development that could lead to improved antiviral therapies for future indications.","Stachulski, Andrew V.; Taujanskas, Joshua; Pate, Sophie L.; Rajoli, Rajith K.

New insights into the molecular pathways that control the development, trafficking and degranulation of eosinophils have improved our understanding of the immunomodulatory functions of these cells and their roles in promoting homeostasis. Likewise, recent developments have generated a more sophisticated view of how eosinophils contribute to the pathogenesis of different diseases, including asthma and primary hypereosinophilic syndromes, and have also provided us with a more complete appreciation of the activities of these cells during parasitic infection.

Diabetic patients' mortality rates with COVID-19 are higher than those of cardiovascular or cancer patients. Recently, Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine has shown successful results in reversing diabetes in both rats and clinical trials based on different mechanisms from aerobic glycolysis to beta cells regeneration. BCG is a multi-face vaccine that has been used extensively in protection from tuberculosis (TB) and leprosy and has been repositioned for treatment of bladder cancer, diabetes and multiple sclerosis. Recently, COVID-19 epidemiological studies confirmed that universal BCG vaccination reduced morbidity and mortality in certain geographical areas. Countries without universal policies of BCG vaccination (Italy, Nederland, USA) have been more severely affected compared to countries with universal and long-standing BCG policies that have shown low numbers of reported COVID-19 cases. Some countries have started clinical trials that included a single dose BCG vaccine as prophylaxis from COVID-19 or an attempt to minimize its side effects. This proposed research aims to use BCG vaccine as a double-edged weapon countering both COVID-19 and diabetes, not only as protection but also as therapeutic vaccination. The work includes a case study of regenerated pancreatic beta cells based on improved C-peptide and PCPRI laboratory findings after BCG vaccination for a 9 year old patient. The patient was re-vaccinated based on a negative tuberculin test and no scar at the site of injection of the 1st BCG vaccination at birth. The authors suggest and invite the scientific community to take into consideration the concept of direct BCG re-vaccination (after 4 weeks) because of the reported gene expressions and exaggerated innate immunity consequently. As the diabetic MODY-5 patient (mutation of HNF1B, Val2Leu) was on low dose Riomet® while eliminating insulin gradually, a simple analytical method for metformin assay was recommended to ensure its concentration before use as it is not approved yet by the Egyptian QC labs.","Ayoub, B M; Ramadan, E; Ashoush, N; Tadros, M M; Hendy, M S; Elmazar, M M; Mousa, S A",Die Pharmazie,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32758336/; https://doi.org/10.1691/ph.2020.0494,650

Though this disease primarily presents as a lower respiratory tract infection, multiple digestive manifestations have been reported which are often overlooked. The present case report describes the unusual progression of COVID-19 disease from pneumonia to a procoagulant state leading to superior mesenteric artery thrombosis and subsequent gut ischemia necessitating emergency laparotomy. Coagulopathy in COVID-19 is due to an imbalance in the coagulation homeostasis with increase in prothrombin time, fibrinogen, and D-dimers. Early recognition of abdominal symptoms, diagnosis of pathology, and timely surgical intervention may definitely improve outcome. In the management of any patient with COVID-19 disease, we advocate a comprehensive integrated approach with early recognition of digestive symptoms and their timely intervention which should run parallel to the respiratory management.","Karna, Sunaina Tejpal; Panda, Rajesh; Maurya, Ajeet Pratap; Kumari, Shashi",Indian J Surg,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12262-020-02638-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33100738/,650

The diffuse inflammation leads to endothelium dysfunction in pulmonary blood vessels, uncoupling eNOS activity, lowering NO production, causing pulmonary physiological alterations and coagulopathy. On the other hand, iNOS activity is increased, which may be advantageous for host defense, once NO plays antiviral effects. However, overproduction of NO may be deleterious, generating a pro-inflammatory effect. In this review, we discussed the role of endogenous NO as a protective or deleterious agent of the respiratory and vascular systems, the most affected in COVID-19 patients, focusing on eNOS and iNOS roles. We also reviewed the currently available NO therapies and pointed out possible alternative treatments targeting NO metabolism, which could help mitigate health crises in the present and future CoV’s spillovers.","Guimarães, Lara; Rossini, Caio V.T.; Lameu, Claudiana",Nitric Oxide,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1089860321000380; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33831567/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.niox.2021.04.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1089860321000380?v=s5,650

However, a major drawback of naked DNA-based vaccines is their low immunogenicity and the amount of plasmid DNA necessary to elicit a response. Nano-sized liposomes can overcome this limitation, enhancing both nucleic acid stability and targeting to cells after administration. We tested two different DNA vaccines in cationic liposomes to improve the immunogenic properties. For this, we cloned the coding sequences of the Plasmodium falciparum reticulocyte binding protein homologue 5 (PfRH5) either alone or fused with small the small hepatitis virus (HBV) envelope antigen (HBsAg) encoding sequences, potentially resulting in HBsAg particles displaying PfRH5 on their outside. Instead of invasive intraperitoneal or intramuscular immunization, we employed intradermal immunization by tattooing nano-encapsulated DNA. Mice were immunized with 10 μg encapsulated DNA encoding PfRH5 alone or in fusion with HBsAg and this elicited antibodies against schizont extracts (titer of 10(4)). Importantly, only IgG from animals immunized with PfRH5-HBs demonstrated sustained IgG-mediated inhibition in in vitro growth assays showing 58% and 39% blocking activity after 24 and 48 h, respectively. Intradermal tattoo-vaccination of encapsulated PfRH5-HBsAg coding plasmid DNA is effective and superior compared with an unfused PfRH5-DNA vaccine, suggesting that the HBsAg fusion may be advantageous with other vaccine antigens.","Fotoran, Wesley Luzetti; Kleiber, Nicole; Glitz, Christiane; Wunderlich, Gerhard",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33092277/; https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines8040619,650
641258,Investigation of Interaction between the Spike Protein of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2-Expressing Cells Using an In Vitro Cell Capturing System,2021-08-26,"Background: The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has resulted in occupational exposure among Healthcare Workers (HCWs) and a high risk of nosocomial transmission. Asymptomatic infection and transmission of infection before the development of symptoms are well-recognized factors contributing to the spread of infection. We conducted a cross-sectional observational study to understand the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCWs and to verify the appropriateness of infection control measures, particularly Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) prophylaxis. Methods: A cross-sectional sero-surveillance study was conducted among 500 HCWs in Dombivli and surrounding Mumbai Metropolitan area (Maharashtra, India) between 21st July and 3rd August 2020. The vulnerability of the study participants to SARS-CoV-2 infection was ascertained through a history of (i) involvement in direct care, (ii) exposure to aerosol-generating procedures, (iii) co-morbidities, (iv) Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) use, and (v) HCQ prophylaxis. SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were tested using COVID KAVACH anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) from Zydus Cadila. A systematic analysis of the correlation between the development of antibodies and factors affecting vulnerability to infection was performed. Results: The overall SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in the study population was 11%. Providing direct care to COVID-19 patients (Adjusted OR 16.4, 95% CI 3.3–126.9, p = 0.002) for long hours and irregular use of PPE (Adjusted OR 3.78, 95% CI 1.1–11.9, p = 0.02) were associated with an increased incidence of seropositivity. Prophylaxis with HCQ may have a role in reducing the vulnerability to infection as depicted by univariate and multivariate analysis (Adjusted OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.3–0.9, p = 0.047). It was also noted that those not on HCQ prophylaxis were threefold more prone to infection and developed severe disease as compared to those on HCQ prophylaxis. Conclusion: Prophylaxis with HCQ may have a role in mitigating the incidence and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although vaccination is the most robust strategy to safeguard against COVID-19, it will be months before vaccination percolates to the masses. In the face of the second wave of COVID-19, the use of HCQ prophylaxis in combination with use of face-masks regularly may be considered as a cost-effective measure for population dense areas like urban slums where social distancing is not possible.","Yadav, Reetika Malik; Pate, Archana; Shankarkumar, Aruna; Athalye, Shreyasi; Shinde, Shweta; Bargir, Umair Ahmed; Pate, Mangesh; Ganpule, Makarand; Pruthi, Meena; Patil, Hemant; Madkaikar, Manisha Rajan",J Epidemiol Glob Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34514761/; https://doi.org/10.2991/jegh.k.210518.001,650

METHODS: Cross-sectional study involving 754 participants ≥ 65 years. Data collected include demographics, cognition, and physical measurements. RESULTS: Females had a higher prevalence of high BMI with CO and a lower prevalence of high BMI without CO than males (61.0% vs 44.6% and 4.6% vs 15.0%, respectively). Within gender, CO groups, regardless of BMI, had lower mini-mental state examination (MMSE), handgrip strength (HGS), and longer timed-up-and-go (TUG) scores. Overall, the high BMI without CO group had the highest MMSE scores, HGS, and shortest TUG. Amongst males, HGS was significantly lower in the normal BMI with CO group (B −3.28, 95% CI −6.32 to −0.23, P = 0.04). CO, regardless of normal/high BMI, had significantly longer TUG time (B 2.65, 95% CI 0.45 to 4.84, P = 0.02; B 1.07, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.88, P = 0.01, respectively) than normal BMI without CO group. CO was associated with lower MMSE scores in both genders but significant only in males with normal BMI and CO (B −1.60, 95% CI −3.15 to −0.06, P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: CO may be a better predictor of obesity and adverse outcomes in older adults. High BMI without CO was associated with better outcomes especially in males but require further validation.

Molecular tools enhance case definitions, increasing specificity and reducing misclassification, and are now a standard tool in outbreak investigations. Although it is assumed during an outbreak that a single microbe is causing the clinical symptoms, it is possible that a microbe of the same genus and species but different strain is causing disease during the same time period. Molecular typing can distinguish between outbreak and nonoutbreak strains. Molecular tools also facilitate estimating parameters key to understanding the transmission system, including the incidence, prevalence, transmission probability, duration of carriage, effective dose, and probability of effective contact. Molecular tools enable one to trace the dissemination of a particular subtype across time and space and thus develop theories of transmission and dissemination, determine the origin of an epidemic and test theories about reservoirs and evolution of a particular pathogen, follow the emergence of new infections as they cross species, testing the hypotheses about the apparent transmissibility and rate of evolution, and follow mobile genetic elements conferring antimicrobial resistance or virulence between strains within a species or between species, and so develop theories about evolution and transmission within the populations of pathogens.","Foxman, Betsy",Molecular Tools and Infectious Disease Epidemiology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123741332000034; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123741332000034,650

The use of ACEIs/ARBs was not associated with higher risks of severe disease (odds ratio [OR] = 0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.63, 1.15; I (2) = 38.55%), mechanical ventilation (OR = 0.89; 95% CI: 0.61, 1.16; I (2) = 3.19%), dialysis (OR = 1.24; 95% CI: 0.09, 2.39; I (2) = 0.00%), or the length of hospital stay (SMD = 0.05; 95% CI: −0.16, 0.26; I (2) = 84.43%) in COVID‐19 patients. The effect estimates showed an overall protective effect of ACEIs/ARBs against mortality (OR = 0.65; 95% CI: 0.46, 0.85; I (2) = 73.37%), severity/mortality (OR = 0.69; 95% CI: 0.43, 0.95; I (2) = 22.90%), transfer to the intensive care unit among COVID‐19 patients with hypertension (OR = 0.36, 95% CI: 0.19, 0.53, I (2) = 0.00%), hospitalization (OR = 0.79; 95% CI: 0.60, 0.98; I (2) = 0.00%), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (OR = 0.71; 95% CI: 0.46, 0.95; I (2) = 0.00%).

In gnotobiotic lambs, inoculation with enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) resulted in diarrhea with a typical clinical picture and patho-anatomical findings. E. coli adhered to the mucosa of the digestive tract at counts amounting to 105 per cm2. In these lambs, disturbances of intestinal biochemical processes became evident; proteolytic enzyme activity was significantly reduced. Preventive administration of Lactobacillus casei inhibited the negative effects of ETEC in gnotobiotic lambs, minimized the clinical signs to those of a very moderate diarrhea in the first 12 h after inoculation and significantly reduced the patho-anatomical findings. Enterotoxigenic E. coli counts decreased by 99.1 and 76% on days 2 and 4 after inoculation respectively, and amounted to 103 per cm2. The inhibitory effects of L. casei against E. coli were most obvious in the jejunum and ileum. The numbers of adhering E. coli increased from the duodenum with the length of the gut. ETEC counts in the digestive tract of lambs that had been preventively treated with L. casei amounted to 107 ml−1. It can be assumed that, in addition to competitive exclusion, the inhibitory effect of L. casei upon ETEC adherence was also mediated by a Lactobacillus-produced substance that inhibited E. coli adhesion to the gut mucosa.","Bomba, A.; Kravjanský, I.; Kaštel', R.; Herich, R.; Juhásová, Z.; Čížek, M.; Kapitančík, B.",Small Ruminant Research,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921448896009054; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0921448896009054,650

Since the beginning of the pandemic, researchers and authorities are mainly concerned with carrying out quantitative studies (modeling and predictions) overcoming the scarcity of tests that lead us to under- reporting cases. To address these issues, we introduce a Bayesian approach to the SIR model with correction for under-reporting in the analysis of COVID-19 cases in Brazil. The proposed model was enforced to obtain estimates of important quantities such as the reproductive rate and the average infection period, along with the more likely date when the pandemic peak may occur. Several under-reporting scenarios were considered in the simulation study, showing how impacting is the lack of information in the modeling.","Oliveira, A. C. S. d.; Morita, L. H. M.; da Silva, E.

648277,SARS-CoV-2 Entry: At the Crossroads of CD147 and ACE2,2021-06-08,"BACKGROUND: Despite rising incidence and mortality rates in Africa, cancer has been given low priority in the research field and in healthcare services. Indeed, 57% of all new cancer cases around the world occur in low income countries exacerbated by lack of awareness, lack of preventive strategies, and increased life expectancies. Despite recent efforts devoted to cancer epidemiology, statistics on cancer rates in Africa are often dispersed across different registries. In this study our goal included identifying the most promising prevention and treatment approaches available in Africa. To do this, we collated and analyzed the incidence and fatality rates for the 10 most common and fatal cancers in 56 African countries grouped into 5 different regions (North, West, East, Central and South) over 16-years (2002–2018). We examined temporal and regional trends by investigating the most important risk factors associated to each cancer type. Data were analyzed by cancer type, African region, gender, measures of socioeconomic status and the availability of medical devices. RESULTS: We observed that Northern and Southern Africa were most similar in their cancer incidences and fatality rates compared to other African regions. The most prevalent cancers are breast, bladder and liver cancers in Northern Africa; prostate, lung and colorectal cancers in Southern Africa; and esophageal and cervical cancer in East Africa. In Southern Africa, fatality rates from prostate cancer and cervical cancer have increased. In addition, these three cancers are less fatal in Northern and Southern Africa compared to other regions, which correlates with the Human Development Index and the availability of medical devices. With the exception of thyroid cancer, all other cancers have higher incidences in males than females. CONCLUSION: Our results show that the African continent suffers from a shortage of medical equipment, research resources and epidemiological expertise. While recognizing that risk factors are interconnected, we focused on risk factors more or less specific to each cancer type. This helps identify specific preventive and therapeutic options in Africa. We see a need for implementing more accurate preventive strategies to tackle this disease as many cases are likely preventable. Opportunities exist for vaccination programs for cervical and liver cancer, genetic testing and use of new targeted therapies for breast and prostate cancer, and positive changes in lifestyle for lung, colorectal and bladder cancers. Such recommendations should be tailored for the different African regions depending on their disease profiles and specific needs.","Hamdi, Yosr; Abdeljaoued-Tej, Ines; Zatchi, Afzal Ali; Abdelhak, Sonia; Boubaker, Samir; Brown, Joel S.; Benkahla, Alia",Front Oncol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2021.650117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33937056/,650

Some members are responsible for large outbreaks, such as Zika virus, West Nile virus, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, while others are endemic, causing an enormous global health burden. Since vaccines or specific treatments are not available for most viral infections, the discovery of direct-acting antivirals (DAA) is an urgent need. Still, the low-throughput nature of and biosafety concerns related to traditional antiviral assays hinders the discovery of new inhibitors. With the advances of reverse genetics, reporter replicon systems have become an alternative tool for the screening of DAAs. Herein, we review decades of the use of (+) ssRNA viruses replicon systems for the discovery of antiviral agents. We summarize different strategies used to develop those systems, as well as highlight some of the most promising inhibitors identified by the method. Despite the genetic alterations introduced, reporter replicons have been shown to be reliable systems for screening and identification of viral replication inhibitors and, therefore, an important tool for the discovery of new DAAs.","Fernandes, Rafaela S.; Freire, Marjorie C.

The N terminus of the coat protein gene was precisely located by comparison with the amino acid sequence determined by the Edman degradation sequencing of the purified coat protein. The coat protein gene encoded a polypeptide of 521 amino acids with a predicted Mr of 57,542. Homology to BBLMV coat protein was highest with tomato ringspot virus (TomRSV) and cherry leaf roll virus (CLRV); two other nepoviruses also belonging to a sub-group defined by the presence of large RNA2 components. The 3' terminal 1390 nt of RNA1 and RNA2 were nearly identical and apparently non-coding. No statistically significant sequence homology was found between the 3' non-coding regions of BBLMV and other nepoviruses. A highly conserved 3' non-coding region of this length is unusual, but has been reported for two other related viruses, TomRSV and CLRV. The biological function of the long 3' non-coding region and how the high level of sequence homology is maintained between RNA1 and RNA2, is unknown. Possible mechanisms for conservation of the 3' terminus are discussed.","Bacher, J. W.; Warkentin, D.; Ramsdell, D.; Hancock, J.

This study describes the experiences after repurposing a PICU and its staff for adult critical care within a state mandated COVID-19 hospital and compares the outcomes to adult patients admitted to the institution's MICU during the same period. Design: A retrospective chart review was performed to analyze outcomes for the adults admitted to the PICU and MICU during the 27-day period the PICU was incorporated into the institution's adult critical care surge plan. Setting: Tertiary care state University hospital. Patients: Critically ill adult patients with proven or suspected COVID-19. Interventions: To select the most ideal adult patients for PICU admission a tiered approach that incorporated older patients with more comorbidities at each stage was implemented. Measurements and Main Results: There were 140 patients admitted to the MICU and 9 patients admitted to the PICU during this period. The mean age of the adult patients admitted to the PICU was lower (49.1 vs. 63.2 p = 0.017). There was no statistically significant difference in the number of comorbidities, intubation rates, days of ventilation, dialysis or LOS. Patients selected for PICU care did not have coronary artery disease, CHF, cerebrovascular disease or COPD. Mean admission Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score was lower in patients admitted to the PICU (4 vs. 6.4, p = 0.017) with similar rates of survival to discharge (66.7 vs. 44.4%, p = 0.64). Conclusion: Outcomes for the adult patients who received care in the PICU did not appear to be worse than those who were admitted to the MICU during this time. While limited by a small sample size, this single center cohort study revealed that careful assessment of critical illness considering age and type of co-morbidities may be a safe and effective approach in determining which critically ill adult patients with known or suspected COVID-19 are the most appropriate for PICU admission in general hospitals with primary management by its physicians and nurses.","Gist, Ramon E.; Pinto, Rohit; Kissoon, Niranjan; Ahmed, Youssef E.; Daniel, Pia; Hamele, Mitchell",Front Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34055697/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2021.665350,650

Methods: anti-SARS-CoV-2 S antibodies levels, viral RNA load and antigenemia were profiled in plasma of 92 adult patients in the first 24 hours following ICU admission. The impact of these variables on 30-day mortality was assessed by using Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariate Cox regression analysis. Results: non survivors showed more frequently absence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 S IgG and IgM antibodies than survivors (26.3% vs 5.6% for IgM and 18.4% vs 5.6% for IgG), and a higher frequency of antigenemia (47.4% vs 22.2%) (p <0.05). Non survivors showed lower concentrations of anti-S IgG and IgM and higher viral RNA loads in plasma, which were associated to increased 30-day mortality and decreased survival mean time. [Adjusted HR (CI95%), p]: [S IgM (AUC [≥]60): 0.48 (0.24; 0.97), 0.040]; [S IgG (AUC [≥]237): 0.47 (0.23; 0.97), 0.042]; [Antigenemia (+): 2.45 (1.27; 4.71), 0.007]; [N1 viral load ([≥] 2.156 copies/mL): 2.21 (1.11; 4.39),0.024]; [N2 viral load ([≥] 3.035 copies/mL): 2.32 (1.16; 4.63), 0.017].

651226,A Computational Approach to Design Potential siRNA Molecules as a Prospective Tool for Silencing Nucleocapsid Phosphoprotein and Surface Glycoprotein Gene of SARS-CoV-2,2020-04-21,"BACKGROUND: There are a variety of approaches being used for malaria surveillance. While active and reactive case detection have been successful in localized areas of low transmission, concerns over scalability and sustainability keep the approaches from being widely accepted. Mobile health interventions are poised to address these shortcomings by automating and standardizing portions of the surveillance process. In this study, common challenges associated with current data aggregation methods have been quantified, and a web-based mobile phone application is presented to reduce the burden of reporting rapid diagnostic test (RDT) results in low-resource settings. METHODS: De-identified completed RDTs were collected at 14 rural health clinics as part of a malaria epidemiology study at Macha Research Trust, Macha, Zambia. Tests were imaged using the mHAT web application. Signal intensity was measured and a binary result was provided. App performance was validated by: (1) comparative limits of detection, investigated against currently used laboratory lateral flow assay readers; and, (2) receiver operating characteristic analysis comparing the application against visual inspection of RDTs by an expert. Secondary investigations included analysis of time-to-aggregation and data consistency within the existing surveillance structures established by Macha Research Trust. RESULTS: When compared to visual analysis, the mHAT app performed with 91.9% sensitivity (CI 78.7, 97.2) and specificity was 91.4% (CI 77.6, 97.0) regardless of device operating system. Additionally, an analysis of surveillance data from January 2017 through mid-February 2019 showed that while the majority of the data packets from satellite clinics contained correct data, 36% of data points required correction by verification teams. Between November 2018 and mid-February 2019, it was also found that 44.8% of data was received after the expected submission date, although most (65.1%) reports were received within 2 days. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the mHAT mobile app was observed to be sensitive and specific when compared to both currently available benchtop lateral flow readers and visual inspection. The additional benefit of automating and standardizing LFA data collection and aggregation poses a vital improvement for low-resource health facilities and could increase the accuracy and speed of data reporting in surveillance campaigns.

Cette thérapie CQ/HCQ doit suivre un algorithme précis destiné à réduire les effets indésirables liés aux médications. Chloroquine (CQ) and its derivative, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), are known to prevent acidification of lysosomes, resulting in the inhibition of endocytic vesicle fusion. Prevention of lysosome fusion is likely to interfere with endocytic trafficking, causing a ""bottleneck"" scenario that might block efficient transport of SARS-CoV-2 to and from the host cell membrane. Besides, the characterization of both CQ and HCQ as broad-spectrum inhibitors of endocytosis might be associated with an expression rate modulation mechanism. Despite the availability of at least five Covid-19 vaccines that are now widely used; understanding the mechanisms possibly involved in the anti-viral effects of CQ and HCQ is of great interest, as knowledge of them could help identify whether the doses used in clinical trials to date have provided an optimal risk/benefit ratio.

It remains challenging to detect and evaluate its severity, which is crucial for prognosis. In this work, we studied if urinary EVs (uEVs) could serve in diagnose and evaluate cirrhosis in ALD. To this purpose, uEVs characterization by cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM), Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA) and Western blotting (WB) was performed in a cohort of 21 controls and 21 cirrhotic patients. Then, proteomics of uEVs was carried out in a second cohort of 6 controls and 8 patients in order to identify new putative biomarkers for cirrhosis in ALD. Interestingly, uEVs concentration, size and protein composition were altered in cirrhotic patients. From a total of 1304 proteins identified in uEVs, 90 of them were found to be altered in cirrhotic patients. The results suggest that uEVs could be considered as a tool and a supplier of new biomarkers for cirrhosis in ALD, whose application would be especially relevant in chronic patients. Yet, further research is necessary to obtain more relevant result in clinical terms.","Gonzalez, Esperanza; Azkargorta, Mikel; Garcia-Vallicrosa, Clara; Prieto-Elordui, Janire; Elortza, Felix; Blanco-Sampascual, Sonia; Falcon-Perez, Juan Manuel",Int J Biol Sci,https://doi.org/10.7150/ijbs.59725; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34131392/,650

Methods: All URT RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 in NHS Lothian, Scotland, United Kingdom between the 7th of February and 19th April 2020 (inclusive) was reviewed, and hospitalised patients were identified. All URT RT-PCR tests were analysed for each patient to determine the sequence of negative and positive results. For those who were tested twice or more but never received a positive result, case records were reviewed, and a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 allocated based on clinical features, discharge diagnosis, and radiology and haematology results. For those who had negative URT RT-PCR tests but a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19, respiratory samples were retested using a multiplex respiratory panel, a second SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay, and a human RNase P control. Results: Compared to the gold standard of a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19, the sensitivity of an initial URT RT-PCR for COVID-19 was 82.2% (95% confidence interval 79.0-85.1%). Two consecutive URT RT-PCR tests increased sensitivity to 90.6% (CI 88.0-92.7%). A further 2.2% and 0.9% of patients who received a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 were positive on a third and fourth test. Conclusions: The sensitivity of a single RT-PCR test of an URT sample in hospitalised patients is 82.2%. Sensitivity increases to 90.6% when patients are tested twice. A proportion of cases with clinically defined COVID-19 never test positive on URT RT-PCR despite repeated testing.","Williams, T.

The use of interstitial fluid (ISF) as a matrix for biomarkers has recently gained interest. This study aimed to compare levels of inflammatory markers in ISF from suction blister fluid (SBF) and plasma. METHODS: Plasma and SBF were collected from 18 healthy individuals. Samples were analyzed for 92 inflammation-related protein biomarkers by Proximity Extension Assay (PEA). Protein profiles in the two matrices were compared using traditional and multivariate statistics. RESULTS: Out of 92 targeted proteins, 70 were successfully quantified in both plasma and SBF. Overall, plasma and SBF displayed distinct protein profiles with up to 40-fold difference in abundance of specific proteins. The levels of 25 proteins were significantly correlated between plasma and SBF and several of these were recognized as potential markers to monitor health using ISF. CONCLUSIONS: Skin ISF and plasma have unique protein profiles but many inflammatory markers are proportionally related between the matrices at the individual level. ISF is a promising biofluid for the monitoring of biomarkers in clinical studies and routine analyses.","Sjöbom, Ulrika; Christenson, Karin; Hellström, Ann; Nilsson, Anders K.",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.597632; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33224151/,650

The disease at first was identified in the city of Wuhan, China in December 2019. Being a human infectious disease, it causes high fever, cough, breathing problems. In some cases it can be fatal, especially in people with comorbidities like heart or kidney problems and diabetes. The current COVID-19 treatment is based on symptomatic therapy, so finding an appropriate drug against COVID-19 remains an immediate and crucial target for the global scientific community. Two main processes are thought to be responsible for the COVID-19 pathogenesis. In the early stages of infection, disease is determined mainly by virus replication. In the later stages of infection, by an excessive immune/inflammatory response, leading to tissue damage. Therefore, the main treatment options are antiviral and immunomodulatory/anti-inflammatory agents. Many clinical trials have been conducted concerning the use of various drugs in COVID-19 therapy, and many are still ongoing. The majority of trials examine drug reposition (repurposing), which seems to be a good and effective option. Many drugs have been repurposed in COVID-19 therapy including remdesivir, favipiravir, tocilizumab and baricitinib. The aim of this review is to highlight (based on existing and accessible clinical evidence on ongoing trials) the current and available promising drugs for COVID-19 and outline their characteristics.","Janik, Edyta; Niemcewicz, Marcin; Podogrocki, Marcin; Saluk-Bijak, Joanna; Bijak, Michal",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22115434; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34063964/,650

If not properly accounted for, recombination can compromise many evolutionary analyses. In addition, when dealing with organisms that are not obligately sexually reproducing, recombination gives insight into the rate at which distinct genetic lineages come into contact. Since June, 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has caused 1106 laboratory-confirmed infections, with 421 MERS-CoV associated deaths as of April 16, 2015. Although bats are considered as the likely ultimate source of zoonotic betacoronaviruses, dromedary camels have been consistently implicated as the source of current human infections in the Middle East. In this paper we use phylogenetic methods and simulations to show that MERS-CoV genome has likely undergone numerous recombinations recently. Recombination in MERS-CoV implies frequent co-infection with distinct lineages of MERS-CoV, probably in camels given the current understanding of MERS-CoV epidemiology.","Dudas, Gytis; Rambaut, Andrew",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/020834,650
653285,Potent SARS-CoV-2 Neutralizing Antibodies Directed Against Spike N-Terminal Domain Target a Single Supersite,2021-01-11,"Introduction Acute appendicitis (AA) is the most common cause of acute abdomen in young adults. The diagnosis is usually made on various clinical findings. However, a missed case of acute appendicitis is a catastrophe as it later presents with life-threatening complications and results in medicolegal issues. Raised total leukocyte count (TLC) is a frequent finding in patients with acute appendicitis. As a convention, a normal leukocyte count usually rules out the differential diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Recent studies claimed that a substantial proportion of patients with normal TLC also had acute appendicitis and warranted a careful evaluation of such cases before sending them home. However, the reported frequency of acute appendicitis among TLC normal patients varied greatly among studies which necessitated the present study. Aim Our aim was to determine the frequency of acute appendicitis in patients of normal TLC. Materials and methods This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted at the Department of Surgery, KRL Hospital Islamabad. This study was carried out from 1 July 2019 to 31 December 2019. This study involved 238 patients of both genders aged between 12 and 70 years suspected of acute appendicitis on physical and ultrasound findings but with a normal TLC (4,500-11,000 WBCs/µL). The outcome variable was the frequency of acute appendicitis among such patients which was diagnosed upon surgery (inflamed appendix with free fluid) and histopathology of excised tissue (mucosal inflammation, neutrophil infiltrates, wall necrosis). Frequency of acute appendicitis was compared across various age and gender groups. Written informed consent was obtained from every patient. Results The mean age of the patients was 27.4±15.5 years. Majority (n = 167, 70.2%) of the patients were aged ≤25 years, followed by 40 (16.8%) patients aged ≥46 years and 31 (13.0%) patients aged between 26 and 45 years. There were 135 (56.7%) male and 103 (43.3%) female patients with a male to female ratio of 1.3:1. All of the patients (100.0%) had pain in the right iliac fossa (RIF) while rebound tenderness, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, fever and dysuria were noted in 83.6%, 79.0%, 73.9%, 63.9% and 15.1% patients, respectively. The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was made in 198 (83.2%) patients with normal TLC and suspicion of acute appendicitis on physical findings and ultrasound. When stratified, there was no statistically significant difference in the frequency of acute appendicitis across various age (p-value = 0.988) and gender (p-value = 0.913) groups. Conclusion In the present study, contrary to the routine impression that normal TLC rules out the differential diagnosis of acute appendicitis, a substantial proportion of patients with clinical and ultrasound suspicion of acute appendicitis but normal TLC had acute appendicitis which is worrisome as a missed case may later present with complications. The present study thus warrants cautious evaluation of clinically suspected cases with normal TLC count to avoid a missed appendicitis and improve the outcome in future surgical practice.","Bilal, Muhammad; Yusufzai, Atif; Asghar, Neelam; Sohail, Ahmed; Khan, Zoobia Z; Zahid, Tehreem; Mumtaz, Hassan; Ahmad, Shahzaib",Cureus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34646622/; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.17566,650

In India, where millions have recently transitioned to using a toilet, pandemic-related barriers to use might increase open defecation practices. We assessed changes in reported defecation practices in peri-urban communities in Tamil Nadu. Field assistants conducted phone surveys in 26 communities in two districts from May 20, 2020 to May 25, 2020. They asked respondents about their access to a toilet, whether they or a family member left their house to defecate in the past week, and whether specific practices had changed since the lockdown. Among 2,044 respondents, 60% had access to a private toilet, 11% to a public or community toilet, whereas 29% lacked access to any toilet facility. In our study, 92% of the respondents did not change their defecation behaviors in the 2 months following the pandemic-related lockdown. About a third (27%) reported that they or a family member left their house daily to defecate amid lockdown measures. A majority of those with private toilets (91%) or with public toilets (69%) continued using them. Respondents with private toilet access were more likely to report an increased frequency of handwashing with soap (prevalence ratio [PR]: 1.78, 95% CI: 1.04–3.05) since the lockdown. The lack of private toilets contributes to the need to leave the house amid a lockdown. Maintaining shared toilets require disinfection protocols and behavioral precautions to limit the risk of fomite transmission. Robust urban COVID-19 control strategies should include enhanced sanitation facility management and safe usage messaging.","Ashraf, Sania; Kuang, Jinyi; Das, Upasak; Bicchieri, Cristina",Am J Trop Med Hyg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32996450/; https://doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.20-0830,650

In the present study, we analysed SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the influent wastewater samples (n = 43) from four wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Gandhinagar, India, during August 7(th) to September 30(th), 2020. A total of 40 samples out of 43 were found positive i.e. having at least two genes of SARS-CoV-2. The average Ct values for S, N, and ORF 1ab genes were 32.66, 33.03, and 33.95, respectively. Monthly variation depicted a substantial rise in the average copies of N (∼120%) and ORF 1ab (∼38%) genes in the month of September as compared to August, while S-gene copies declined by 58% in September 2020. The SARS-CoV-2 genome concentration was higher in the month of September (∼924.5 copies/L) than August (∼897.5 copies/L), corresponding to a ∼ 2.2-fold rise in the number of confirmed cases during the study period. Further, the percentage change in genome concentration level on a particular date was found in the lead of 1-2 weeks of time with respect to the official confirmed cases registered based on clinical tests on a temporal scale. The results profoundly unravel the potential of WBE surveillance to predict the fluctuation of COVID-19 cases to provide an early warning. Our study explicitly suggests that it is the need of hour that the wastewater surveillance must be included as an integral part of COVID-19 pandemic monitoring which can not only help the water authorities to identify the hotspots within a city but can provide up to 2 weeks of time lead for better tuning the management interventions.","Kumar, Manish; Joshi, Madhvi; Patel, Arbind Kumar; Joshi, Chaitanya G.",Environ Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935121002401?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.110946; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0013935121002401; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33662347/,650

In this study, we aimed to assess this by evaluating the relationship between sP-Selectin level and the clinical severity of COVID-19 infections. METHODS: A total of 80 patients (50 with mild to moderate and 30 with severe COVID-19 pneumonia), and 60 non-symptomatic healthy volunteers participated in the study. Following serum isolation, sP-Selectin levels were assessed by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) method. RESULTS: The serum sP-Selectin level was 1.7 ng/ml in the control group (1–3.78); 6.24 ng/ml (5.14–7.23) in mild-to-moderate pneumonia group; and 6.72 ng/ml (5.36–8.03) in the severe pneumonia group. Serum sP-Selectin levels in both mild-to-moderate pneumonia and severe pneumonia groups were found to be higher than the control group, with statistical significance (p = 0.0001 and p = 0.0001, respectively). Receiver operating characteristic analysis (ROC) showed greater area under the curve (AUC) for the serum sP-Selectin levels of the COVID-19 patients (AUC = 0.913, 95% CI = 0.857–0.969; p = 0.0001). The serum sP-Selectin level was found to be 97.5% sensitive and 80% specific at 4.125 ng/ml level for diagnosis (p = 0.0001). The serum sP-Selectin level was found to be 76.9% sensitive and 51.9% specific at the level of 6.12 ng/ml (p = 0.005) to predict the need for intensive care treatment. CONCLUSION: This study showed that sP-Selectin can be used as a valuable biomarker in both diagnosing and predicting the need for intensive care treatment of COVID-19 infection.","Karsli, Emre; Sabirli, Ramazan; Altintas, Emel; Canacik, Omer; Sabirli, Gizem Tukenmez; Kaymaz, Buse; Kurt, Özgür; Koseler, Aylin",Life Sci,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0024320521006202; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024320521006202; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2021.119634; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34015287/,650
656227,SARS-CoV-2 receptor mutation in Egyptian population,2020-05-02,"Background On April 7, 2020, the Japanese government declared a state of emergency regarding the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). Given the nation-wide spread of the coronavirus in major Japanese cities and the rapid increase in the number of cases with untraceable infection routes, large-scale monitoring for capturing the current epidemiological situation of COVID-19 in Japan is urgently required. Methods A chatbot-based healthcare system named COOPERA (COvid-19: Operation for Personalized Empowerment to Render smart prevention And AN care seeking) was developed to surveil the Japanese epidemiological situation in real-time. COOPERA asked questions regarding personal information, location, preventive actions, COVID-19 related symptoms and their residence. Empirical Bayes estimates of the age-sex-standardized incidence rate and disease mapping approach using scan statistics were utilized to identify the geographical distribution of the symptoms in Tokyo and their spatial correlation r with the identified COVID-19 cases. Findings We analyzed 353,010 participants from Tokyo recruited from 27th March to 6th April 2020. The mean (SD) age of participants was 42.7 (12.3), and 63.4%, 36.4% or 0.2% were female, male, or others, respectively. 95.6% of participants had no subjective symptoms. We identified several geographical clusters with high spatial correlation (r = 0.9), especially in downtown areas in central Tokyo such as Shibuya and Shinjuku. Interpretation With the global spread of COVID-19, medical resources are being depleted. A new system to monitor the epidemiological situation, COOPERA, can provide insights to assist political decision to tackle the epidemic. In addition, given that Japan has not had a strong lockdown policy to weaken the spread of the infection, our result would be useful for preparing for the second wave in other countries during the next flu season without a strong lockdown.

The World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed the outbreak and determined it a global pandemic. The current pandemic has infected nearly 300 million people and killed over 3 million. The current COVID-19 pandemic is smashing every public health barrier, guardrail, and safety measure in underdeveloped and the most developed countries alike, with peaks and troughs across time. Greatly impacted are those regions experiencing conflict and war. Morbidity and mortality increase logarithmically for those communities at risk and that lack the ability to promote basic preventative measures. States around the globe struggle to unify responses, make gains on preparedness levels, identify and symptomatically treat positive cases, and labs across the globe frantically rollout various vaccines and effective surveillance and therapeutic mechanisms. The incidence and prevalence of COVID-19 may continue to increase globally as no unified disaster response is manifested and disinformation spreads. During this failure in response, virus variants are erupting at a dizzying pace. Ungoverned spaces where nonstate actors predominate and active war zones may become the next epicenter for COVID-19 fatality rates. As the incidence rates continue to rise, hospitals in North America and Europe exceed surge capacity, and immunity post infection struggles to be adequately described. The global threat in previously high-quality, robust infrastructure health-care systems in the most developed economies are failing the challenge posed by COVID-19; how will less-developed economies and those health-care infrastructures that are destroyed by war and conflict fare until adequate vaccine penetrance in these communities or adequate treatment are established? Ukraine and other states in the Black Sea Region are under threat and are exposed to armed Russian aggression against territorial sovereignty daily. Ukraine, where Russia has been waging war since 2014, faces this specific dual threat: disaster response to violence and a deadly infectious disease. To best serve biosurveillance, aid in pandemic disaster response, and bolster health security in Europe, across the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance (NATO) and Black Sea regions, increased NATO integration, across Ukraine’s disaster response structures within the Ministries of Health, Defense, and Interior must be reinforced and expanded to mitigate the COVID-19 disaster.","Quinn V, John M.; Dhabalia, Trisha Jigar; Roslycky, Lada L.; Wilson V, James M.; Hansen, Jan-Cedric; Hulchiy, Olesya; Golubovskaya, Olga; Buriachyk, Mykola; Vadim, Kondratiuk; Zauralskyy, Rostyslav; Vyrva, Oleg; Stepanskyi, Dmytro; Ivanovitch, Pokhil Sergiy; Mironenko, Alla; Shportko, Volodymyr; McElligott, John E.",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2021.88; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33762057/,650

A key strategy in the program is to test for presence of antibodies and protect test-negative herds from infection. Because these viruses are endemic, the rate of re-introduction can be high, and a disease-free status will become more uncertain as time from testing elapses. The aim of this study was to estimate the probability of freedom (PostPFree) from BRSV and BCV antibodies over time by use of bulk tank milk (BTM) antibody-testing, geographic information and animal movement data, and to validate the herd-level estimates against subsequent BTM testing. BTM samples were collected from 1148 study herds in West Norway in 2013 and 2016, and these were analyzed for BRSV and BCV antibodies. PostPFree was calculated for herds that were negative in 2013/2014, and updated periodically with new probabilities every three months. Input variables were test sensitivity, the probability of introduction through animal purchase and local transmission. Probability of introduction through animal purchase was calculated by using real animal movement data and herd prevalence in the region of the source herd. The PostPFree from the final three months in 2015 was compared to BTM test results from March 2016 using a Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test. The probability of freedom was generally high for test-negative herds immediately after testing, reflecting the high sensitivity of the tests. It did however, decrease with time since testing, and was greatly affected by purchase of livestock. When comparing the median PostPFree for the final three months to the test results in 2016, it was significantly lower (p < 0.01) for test positive herds. Furthermore, there was a large difference in the proportion of test positive herds between the first and fourth quartile of PostPFree. The results show that PostPFree provides a better estimate of herd-level BTM status for both BRSV and BCV than what can be achieved by relying solely on the previous test-result.","Toftaker, Ingrid; Ågren, Estelle; Stokstad, Maria; Nødtvedt, Ane; Frössling, Jenny",Prev Vet Med,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167587718303738; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2018.07.002; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167587718303738; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30064709/,650

Owing to the emergency medical services (EMS) of our region, all time components of ST-elevated myocardial infarction care were similar during the COVID-19 outbreak as compared with the previous year’s dataset. Among the 106 ACS patients in 2020, 7 patients tested positive for COVID-19. Higher incidence of type 2 myocardial infarction (29% vs. 4%, p = 0.0497) and elevated D-dimer levels (5650 μg/l [interquartile range (IQR) 1905–13,625 μg/l] vs. 400 μg/l [IQR 270–1050 μg/l], p = 0.02) were observed in COVID-19 patients. In sum, a significant reduction in admission for AMI was observed during the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 patients were characterized by elevated D-dimer levels on admission, reflecting enhanced COVID-19 related thrombogenicity. The prehospital evaluation by EMS may have played an important role for the timely revascularization for STEMI patients.

Patient self-inflicted lung injury (P-SILI) is theorized as the responsible, but there is not robust experimental and clinical data to support it. Given the limited understanding of P-SILI, we describe the physiological basis of P-SILI and we show experimental data to comprehend the role of regional strain and heterogeneity in lung injury due to increased work of breathing.

However, there remain no very effective treatment for OAB. Pharmacotherapy is one of the best treatments, but it is not always efficient and may incur adverse events. Although behavioral therapy is another effective treatment, there are very few structured treatment manuals on how to prescribe behavioral therapy to treat OAB for whom. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a psychotherapy consisting of structured sessions to solve problems with the collaborative empiricism between therapists and patients. OAB symptoms are supposed to worsen with cognitive distortion, and CBT is expected to be effective in treating OAB by modifying such cognitive processes. In this trial, we will evaluate the efficacy of CBT for OAB. METHODS: A randomized, controlled, open-label, multicenter parallel-group superiority trial will be conducted. Participants with moderate to severe OAB symptoms with or without pharmacotherapy will be recruited and will be randomly allocated 1:1 to two different groups by minimization (age, baseline OAB severity, treatment status, types of intervention, and treating institutions). The intervention group will be prescribed an individual CBT program covering six techniques in 4 sessions (30 min each), with or without pharmacotherapy. The primary outcome is the change scores in an OAB-questionnaire (OAB-q) from baseline to the end of the trial (week 13). Secondary outcomes will include other patient reported outcome measures and the frequency volume chart. All analyses will be conducted on an intention-to-treat principle. DISCUSSION: This trial will determine the efficacy of CBT to treat OAB using a rigorous methodology. The effectiveness of CBT with a structured manual may not only lead to a new treatment option for patients suffering from OAB symptoms, but may also reduce the social burden by OAB.

Understanding the dynamics of the epidemic is essential for decision making, and to reduce the health, economic, and social impacts of the pandemic. The present study aimed to estimate the effective reproductive number (Rt) of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov2) infection during the first 10 days of the outbreak in seven Latin American countries with the highest incidence of cases as of March 23, 2020. Furthermore, we chose to compare the seven countries with Spain and Italy given their history with the virus. Methods Incidence data retrieved from the COVID-19 data repository by Johns Hopkins University were analyzed. The Rt was calculated for the first 10 days of the epidemic in Brazil, Ecuador, Chile, Colombia, Panama, Mexico, and Peru. Rt estimations were compared with Spain and Italy values for the same interval. Results The median Rt for the first 10 days of the COVID-19 epidemic were 2.90 (2.67-3.14) for Spain and 2.83 (2.7-2.96) for Italy. Latin American Rt estimations were higher in Ecuador (3.95(3.7-4.21)), Panama (3.95(3.7-4.21)), and Brazil (3.95(3.7-4.21)). The smallest one was observed in Peru (2.36(2.11-2.63)). All Latin American countries had Rt greater than 2. Conclusions The initial stages of the COVID-19 epidemic in Latin America suggested a high Rt. Interventions such as domestic and international travel restrictions, educational institutions closure, social distancing, and intensified case surveillance should be adopted to prevent the collapse of the health systems.","Ochoa, Yaset Caicedo; Sanchez, David E Rebellón; Peñaloza, Marcela; Motta, Hector F Cortes; Méndez-Fandiño, Yardany R",Int J Infect Dis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S120197122030285X?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32360941/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S120197122030285X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.069,650

METHODS: A 60‐year‐old male with history of recent transoral robotic surgery resection, free flap reconstruction, and tracheostomy for p16+ squamous cell carcinoma presented with stridor and dyspnea 1 month after decannulation. Careful planning by a multidisciplinary team allowed for appropriate staffing and personal protective equipment, preparations for emergency airway management, evaluation via nasopharyngolaryngoscopy, and COVID testing. The patient was found to be COVID negative and underwent imaging which revealed new pulmonary nodules and a tracheal lesion. RESULTS: The patient was safely transorally intubated in the operating room. The tracheal lesion was removed endoscopically and tracheostomy was avoided.

As of the present, the SARS-CoV-2-borne disease is propagating in almost all countries, affecting hundreds of thousands of people in an unprecedented way. As the name suggests, the novel coronavirus, widely known as SARS-CoV-2, is a new emerging human pathogen. A novel disease of relatively unknown origin, COVID-19 does not seem to be amenable to the currently available medicines since there is no specific cure for the disease. In the absence of any vaccine or effective antiviral medication, we have no tools at our disposal, but the method of quarantine, be it domestic or institutional, to hinder any further progression of this outbreak. However, there is a record of physicians in the past who practiced convalescent blood transfusion. To their awe, the method seemed to be useful. It is anticipated that these contemporary methods will outdo any other vaccination process in the time being, as blood transfusion is instead a cost-effective and time-friendly technique. Following a successful trial, this new approach of contemporary nature to a viral disease may serve as an emergency intervention to intercept infectious outbreaks and prevent an impending epidemic/pandemic. In this review, we document the most recent evidence regarding the efficiency of convalescent plasma and serum therapy on SARS, MERS, and particularly COVID-19, while discussing potential advantages and possible risks of such practice.","Sheervalilou, Roghayeh; Shirvaliloo, Milad; Sargazi, Saman; Bahari, Soraiya; Saravani, Ramin; Shahraki, Jafar; Shirvalilou, Sakine; Shahraki, Omolbanin; Nazarlou, Ziba; Shams, Zinat; Ghaznavi, Habib",Blood Purif,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33789273/; https://doi.org/10.1159/000513164,650

Pregnant women are a group requiring special attention in medicine given the anatomical and physiological changes that occur during pregnancy. Skin rash is commonly associated with pregnancy, with the most common form of an erythematous maculopapular rash being pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy. Skin rash is also an increasingly reported initial presentation in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), due to infection with SARS-CoV-2. CASE REPORT: A 34-year-old woman with a diamniotic dichorionic twin pregnancy presented with clinical picture characterized by dermatological manifestations, namely an erythematous and papular skin rash associated with SARSCoV-2 infection. A real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (GeneFinder) test was positive for SARS-CoV-2 detection. CONCLUSIONS: Ten months after the onset of this pandemic, there is no conclusive evidence indicating that pregnant women represent a sector more or less vulnerable to severe forms of COVID-19 than the general population.

To describe patterns of multimorbidity among fatal cases of COVID-19, and to propose a classification of patients based on age and multimorbidity patterns to begin the construction of etiological models. METHODS. Data of Colombian confirmed deaths of COVID-19 until June 11, 2020, were included in this analysis (n=1488 deaths). Relationships between COVID-19, combinations of health conditions and age were explored using locally weighted polynomial regressions. RESULTS. The most frequent health conditions were high blood pressure, respiratory disease, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and kidney disease. Dyads more frequents were high blood pressure with diabetes, cardiovascular disease or respiratory disease. Some multimorbidity patterns increase probability of death among older individuals, whereas other patterns are not age-related, or decrease the probability of death among older people. Not all multimorbidity increases with age, as is commonly thought. Obesity, alone or with other diseases, was associated with a higher risk of severity among young people, while the risk of the high blood pressure/diabetes dyad tends to have an inverted U distribution in relation with age. CONCLUSIONS. Classification of individuals according to multimorbidity in the medical management of COVID-19 patients is important to determine the possible etiological models and to define patient triage for hospitalization. Moreover, identification of non-infected individuals with high-risk ages and multimorbidity patterns serves to define possible interventions of selective confinement or special management.","Fernández-Niño, Julián A.; Guerra-Gómez, John A.; J.

A retrospective cohort study of gynecologic oncology patients with an index unplanned encounter between January and December 2018 was performed. Super-utilizers were defined as patients with 3 or more unplanned hospital encounters during a 12-month period starting at the time of the index unplanned encounter. We identified 553 patients with gynecologic cancer. Of those, 37(7%) met inclusion criteria for super-utilizers accounting for 193/310(62%) of unplanned visits. The median number of unplanned visits was 4 (range 3–24). The most common cancers were uterine (N = 15 (41%)) and ovarian (N = 11 (30%)). Nineteen (51%) super-utilizers had advanced stage disease. Phases of oncologic care at index unplanned encounter included primary diagnosis (N = 24 (65%)), recurrence (N = 10 (27%)), and surveillance (N = 2 (5%)). Twelve super-utilizers (32%) had new diagnoses of cancer without prior therapy, 19(51%) had prior chemotherapy, 17(46%) had prior surgery, and 10(27%) had prior radiation therapy at the time of initial encounter. Fifteen super-utilizers (41%) were in the last year of life. The most common reasons for unplanned encounters were pain (66%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (61%). Multivariable analysis adjusting for key variables demonstrated that Medicaid insurance, ASA classification, and disease status are risk factors for health care super-utilization. The majority of health care utilization occurred during the first year of diagnosis. This exploratory analysis suggests an opportunity to decrease health care utilization, particularly during upfront treatment.","Zivanov, Catherine N.; Apple, Annie; Brown, Alaina J.; Robinson, Marc A.; Prescott, Lauren S.",Gynecol Oncol Rep,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gore.2021.100789; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34095425/,650

There is a lack of research on how the common elements of phishing emails, such as the presence of misspellings and the use of urgency and threatening language, influences how the email is processed and judged by individuals. Eye tracking technology may provide insight into this. In this exploratory study a sample of 22 participants viewed a series of emails with or without indicators associated with phishing emails, whilst their eye movements were recorded using a SMI RED 500 eye-tracker. Participants were also asked to give a numerical rating of how trustworthy they deemed each email to be. Overall, it was found that participants looked more frequently at the indicators associated with phishing than would be expected by chance but spent less overall time viewing these elements than would be expected by chance. The emails that included indicators associated with phishing were rated as less trustworthy on average, with the presence of misspellings or threatening language being associated with the lowest trustworthiness ratings. In addition, it was noted that phishing indicators relating to threatening language or urgency were viewed before misspellings. However, there was no significant interaction between the trustworthiness ratings of the emails and the amount of scanning time for phishing indicators within the emails. These results suggest that there is a complex relationship between the presence of indicators associated with phishing within an email and how trustworthy that email is judged to be. This study also demonstrates that eye tracking technology is a feasible method with which to identify and record how phishing emails are processed visually by individuals, which may contribute toward the design of future mitigation approaches.","McAlaney, John; Hills, Peter J.",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32849040/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01756,650

This allowed flexibility, which in turn enabled compliance with the established schedule.","Ribera-Perianes, Jordi; Cases, Xavier; Tapias, Andrés; Perissinotti, Andrés; Sánchez-Izquierdo, Nuria; Vidal-Sicart, Sergi",Revista de Senología y Patología Mamaria,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0214158220301183; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0214158220301183,650
663575,Synthetic Heparan Sulfate Mimetic Pixatimod (PG545) Potently Inhibits SARS-CoV-2 By Disrupting The Spike-ACE2 interaction,2021-03-01,"Calpains are calcium-dependent cysteine peptidases that were originally described in mammals and, thereafter, their homologues were identified in almost all known living organisms. The deregulated activity of these peptidases is associated with several pathologies and, consequently, huge efforts have been made to identify selective inhibitors. Trypanosomatids, responsible for life-threatening human diseases, possess a large and diverse family of calpain sequences in their genomes. Considering that the current therapy to treat trypanosomatid diseases is limited to a handful of drugs that suffer from unacceptable toxicity, tough administration routes, like parenteral, and increasing treatment failures, a repurposed approach with calpain inhibitors could be a shortcut to successful chemotherapy. However, there is a general lack of knowledge about calpain functions in these parasites and, currently, the proteolytic activity of these proteins is still an open question. Here, we highlight the current research and perspectives on trypanosomatid calpains, overview calpain description in these organisms, and explore the potential of targeting the calpain system as a therapeutic strategy. This review gathers the current knowledge about this fascinating family of peptidases as well as insights into the puzzle: are we unable to measure calpain activity in trypanosomatids, or are the functions of these proteins devoid of proteolytic activity in these parasites?","Ennes-Vidal, Vítor; Branquinha, Marta Helena; dos Santos, André Luis Souza; d’Avila-Levy, Claudia Masini",Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33535641/; https://doi.org/10.3390/cells10020299,650
663878,"SARS-CoV-2: cómo es, cómo actúa y cómo se expresa en la imagen",2020-11-17,"Type II (proteic) toxin–antitoxin (TA) operons are widely spread in bacteria and archaea. They are organized as operons in which, usually, the antitoxin gene precedes the cognate toxin gene. The antitoxin generally acts as a transcriptional self-repressor, whereas the toxin acts as a co-repressor, both proteins constituting a harmless complex. When bacteria encounter a stressful environment, TAs are triggered. The antitoxin protein is unstable and will be degraded by host proteases, releasing the free toxin to halt essential processes. The result is a cessation of cell growth or even death. Because of their ubiquity and the essential processes targeted, TAs have been proposed as good candidates for development of novel antimicrobials. We discuss here the possible druggability of TAs as antivirals and antibacterials, with focus on the potentials and the challenges that their use may find in the ‘real’ world. We present strategies to develop TAs as antibacterials in view of novel technologies, such as the use of very small molecules (fragments) as inhibitors of protein–protein interactions. Appropriate fragments could disrupt the T:A interfaces leading to the release of the targeted TA pair. Possible ways of delivery and formulation of Tas are also discussed.","Chan, Wai Ting; Balsa, Dolors; Espinosa, Manuel",FEMS Microbiol Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25796610/; https://doi.org/10.1093/femsre/fuv002,650
663925,Molecular mechanism of SARS-Cov-2 components caused ARDS in murine model,2020-07-02,"The current widespread of COVID-19 all over the world, which is caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, has again emphasized the importance of development of point-of-care (POC) diagnostics for timely prevention and control of the pandemic. Compared with labor- and time-consuming traditional diagnostic methods, POC diagnostics exhibit several advantages such as faster diagnostic speed, better sensitivity and specificity, lower cost, higher efficiency and ability of on-site detection. To achieve POC diagnostics, developing POC detection methods and correlated POC devices is the key and should be given top priority. The fast development of microfluidics, micro electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) technology, nanotechnology and materials science, have benefited the production of a series of portable, miniaturized, low cost and highly integrated POC devices for POC diagnostics of various infectious diseases. In this review, various POC detection methods for the diagnosis of infectious diseases, including electrochemical biosensors, fluorescence biosensors, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)-based biosensors, colorimetric biosensors, chemiluminiscence biosensors, surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based biosensors, and magnetic biosensors, were first summarized. Then, recent progresses in the development of POC devices including lab-on-a-chip (LOC) devices, lab-on-a-disc (LOAD) devices, microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (μPADs), lateral flow devices, miniaturized PCR devices, and isothermal nucleic acid amplification (INAA) devices, were systematically discussed. Finally, the challenges and future perspectives for the design and development of POC detection methods and correlated devices were presented. The ultimate goal of this review is to provide new insights and directions for the future development of POC diagnostics for the management of infectious diseases and contribute to the prevention and control of infectious pandemics like COVID-19.","Wang, Chao; Liu, Mei; Wang, Zhifei; Li, Song; Deng, Yan; He, Nongyue",Nano Today,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nantod.2021.101092; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1748013221000177; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1748013221000177; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33584847/,650

The COVID-19 pandemic has imposed radical behavioral and social changes in the general population, significantly impacting the lives of individuals affected by disabilities. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on non-institutionalized subjects with sensorineural disabilities during the first COVID-19 wave in Italy. Methods. A 39-item online national survey was disseminated from 1 April 2020 to 31 June 2020 via social media throughout Italy to communities of individuals with proven severe sensorineural disabilities, affiliated to five national patient associations. The survey collected extensive information on the socio-demographic profile, health, everyday activities, and lifestyle of individuals with hearing and visual disabilities. Results. One hundred and sixty-three respondents with hearing (66.9%) and visual (33.1%) disabilities returned a usable questionnaire. The mean age of interviewees was 38.4 ± 20.2 years and 56.3% of them were females. Despite the vast majority of respondents (77.9%) perceiving their health status as unchanged (68.8% of interviewees with hearing deficits vs. 96.3% of those with visual impairments), about half the interviewees reported sleep disorders during lock-down, more likely those with visual deficits. Remote services were seemingly more effective for business than school activities. Furthermore, although just 18.8% of respondents rated remote rehabilitation care unsatisfactory, only 12.8% of interviewees felt supported by health and social services during the COVID-19 emergency. The vast majority of respondents were concerned about the future and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 contagion, particularly individuals with hearing impairments. Among the various risk mitigation measures, facemasks caused the greatest discomfort due to communication barriers, particularly among interviewees affected by hearing disabilities (92.2% vs. 45.7%). The most common request (46.5%) of respondents to reduce the inconveniences of the COVID-19 emergency country lock-down was improving the access to and delivery of health and social services for individuals with sensorineural disabilities (19.3%), followed by the use of transparent masks (17.5%). Conclusions. Although health protection measures such as face masks and social distancing play a key role in preventing and controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the unmet needs of disabled individuals should be carefully considered, especially those affected by sensory disabilities. Tailored access to health and social services for individuals affected by sensorineural disabilities should be implemented. Additional actions should include the use of to face masks to reduce communication barriers linked to hearing-impairment, as well as the improvement of remote services, especially distance learning at school.","Bubbico, Luciano; Bellizzi, Saverio; Ferlito, Salvatore; Maniaci, Antonino; Leone Guglielmotti, Raffaella; Antonelli, Giulio; Mastrangelo, Giuseppe; Cegolon, Luca",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph181910208; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34639515/,650

Almost two million people have died of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). A high SOFA score and a D-Dimer >1 µg/mL identifies patients with high risk of mortality. High lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels on admission are associated with severity and mortality. Different degrees of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) abnormalities have been reported in these patients, its association with a mortality risk remains controversial. The aim of this study was to explore the correlation between LDH and in-hospital mortality in Mexican patients admitted with COVID-19. Materials & Methods We performed a retrospective multi-centre cohort study with 377 hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 in three centres in Mexico City, Mexico, who were ≥18 years old and died or were discharged between April 1 and May 31, 2020. Results A total of 377 patients were evaluated, 298 (79.1%) patients were discharged, and 79 (20.9%) patients died during hospitalization. Non-survivors were older, with a median age of 46.7 ± 25.7 years old, most patients were male. An ALT > 61 U/l (OR 3.45, 95% CI 1.27-9.37; p = 0.015), C-reactive protein (CRP) > 231 mg/l (OR 4.71, 95% CI 2.35-9.46; p = 0.000), LDH > 561 U/l (OR 3.03, 95% CI 1.40-6.55; p = 0.005) were associated with higher odds for in-hospital death. Conclusions Our results indicate that higher levels of LDH, CRP, and ALT are associated with higher in-hospital mortality risk in Mexican patients admitted with COVID-19.","Vidal-Cevallos, Paulina; Higuera-De-La-Tijera, Fatima; Chávez-Tapia, Norberto C.; Sanchez-Giron, Francisco; Reyes, Eira Cerda; Rosales-Salyano, Victor Hugo; Servin-Caamaño, Alfredo; Medina, Martín Uriel Vázquez; Mendez-Sanchez, Nahum",Ann Hepatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33647501/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1665268121000375; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aohep.2021.100338; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1665268121000375?v=s5,650

However, few studies have been conducted on the infection of E. bieneusi and Cryptosporidium spp. in peafowl up to now. The purpose of the present study was to determine the prevalence and the involved genotypes of Cryptosporidium spp. and E. bieneusi in peafowl in Beijing and Jiangxi Province, China. In total, 258 peafowl fecal samples were collected. Overall, both Cryptosporidium spp. and E. bieneusi had the same prevalence, i.e. 6.59% (17/258). Higher infection rates of E. bieneusi and Cryptosporidium spp. were found in the adolescent peafowl. The prevalence of E. bieneusi in Beijing and Jiangxi Province was 5.23% and 8.57% respectively. For Cryptosporidium spp., the prevalence was 4.58% and 9.52% in Beijing and Jiangxi Province, respectively. Three zoonotic genotypes of E. bieneusi were confirmed, including two known genotypes, genotype Peru 6 and D, and one novel genotype, JXP1. Two avian specific species/genotypes of Cryptosporidium, Avian genotype Ⅲ and Goose genotype Ⅰ, were identified. To our knowledge, this is the first report of E. bieneusi and Cryptosporidium spp. occurrence in peafowl in China. The findings suggest that peafowl could be reservoirs of E. bieneusi and Cryptosporidium spp. which could be potentially transmitted to humans and other animals, and the present survey have implications for controlling E. bieneusi and Cryptosporidium spp. infection in peafowl.","Feng, Sheng-Yong; Chang, Han; Luo, Jing; Huang, Jing-Jing; He, Hong-Xuan",Int J Parasitol Parasites Wildl,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijppaw.2019.03.014; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213224419300410; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30976510/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2213224419300410,650

Early diagnostics enable a timely noninvasive ventilation treatment and can prevent overt ventilatory failure and avoid acute invasive ventilation. Diagnostic measures are available, so that the risk of developing overt respiratory failure can be ascertained in time. Treatment of respiratory pump insufficiency, i.e. ventilatory insufficiency, is also established. Many patients with ventilatory insufficiency use intermittent or continuous ventilation every day in order to relieve the respiratory musculature. Many studies have confirmed an extension of life expectancy and a better quality of life, when this relief together with a lowering of the pCO(2) is achieved under ventilation and more importantly while breathing spontaneously. If the target of lowering the pCO(2) is not achieved, an effect of intermittent ventilation cannot be detected. The more severe the disease, the more difficult it is to achieve relief, because the substantial effort needed for breathing by the patient can hardly be relieved by assisted ventilation alone. The relief is always guaranteed by a total passive mechanical ventilation below the apnea threshold so that the patient does not need to independently breathe. A high tidal volume, an adequately high respiratory rate and a prolonged inspiration time are necessary in order to reduce the pCO(2) to below the normal range and to induce passive ventilation. No lung damage has been observed with this treatment strategy in a large number of patients.","Laier-Groeneveld, G.; Criée, C.-P.",Pneumologe (Berl),https://doi.org/10.1007/s10405-020-00357-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33223983/,650

While there are studies that analyze dreams in high-stress situations, little is known of how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted dreams of university students. The aim of this study was to explore how the dream content of students was affected during the university COVID-19 lockdown period (March–July, 2020). Using online survey methods, we analyzed dream recall content (n = 71) using the Hall-Van de Castle dream coding system and Fisher's exact tests for sex comparisons. Preliminary results indicate that female students experienced more nightmares as compared to male students. Dream analysis found that, relative to normative American College Student (ACS) samples generated pre-COVID-19, women were more likely to experience aggressive interactions in their dream content, including increased physical aggression. Results indicate that university students did experience changes in dream content due to the pandemic lockdown period, with women disproportionally affected.

Courses are usually supervised by experienced faculty staff (FS) with patient bedside examinations or students among each other but often overbooked due to limited FS availability. To overcome this barrier, use of teaching videos may be advantageous. Likewise, peer teaching concepts solely with trained student tutors have shown to be feasible and effective. The aim was to evaluate 1) objective learning outcomes of a combined video-based, student-tutor (ViST) as compared to a FS-led course without media support, 2) acceptance and subjective learning success of the videos. METHODS: Two ultrasound teaching videos for basic and advanced abdominal ultrasound (AU) and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) were produced and six students trained as tutors. Fourth-year medical students (N = 96) were randomized to either the ViST- or FS course (6 students per tutor). Learning objectives were defined equally for both courses. Acquired practical basic and advanced ultrasound skills were tested in an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) using modified validated scoring sheets with a maximum total score of 40 points. Acceptance and subjective learning success of both videos were evaluated by questionnaires based on Kirkpatrick’s evaluation model with scale-rated closed and open questions. RESULTS: 79 of 96 medical students completed the OSCE and 77 could be finally analyzed. There was no significant difference in the mean total point score of 31.3 in the ViST (N = 42) and 32.7 in the FS course (N = 35, P = 0.31) or in any of the examined basic or advanced ultrasound skill subtasks. Of the 42 ViST participants, 29 completed the AU and 27 the TTE video questionnaire. Acceptance and subjective learning success of both videos was rated positively in 14–52% and 48–88% of the rated responses to each category, respectively. Attendance of either the student or faculty tutor was deemed necessary in addition to the videos. CONCLUSIONS: A ViST versus FS teaching concept was able to effectively teach undergraduate students in AU and TTE, albeit acceptance of the teaching videos alone was limited. However, the ViST concept has the potential to increase course availability and FS resource allocation.

Risk of infection can be minimized by use of proper personal protective equipment (PPE). This study assessed the availability of PPE and satisfaction of HCPs in six public hospitals in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. A cross-sectional study was conducted from 9th to 26th June 2020. The study hospitals included: Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital, Zewditu Memorial Hospital, Ghandi Memorial Hospital, Menelik II Hospital, Yekatit 12 Hospital Medical College and St. Paul Hospital Millennium Medical College. Data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the data and Chi-square test was used to assess the association between the groups. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess factors associated with the satisfaction level of healthcare workers with regard to the availability and use of proper PPE during the current COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 1,134 (92.3%) valid questionnaires from a possible 1,228 were included in the analysis. The mean (SD) age of the participants was 30.26 (6.43) year and 52.6% were females. Nurses constituted about 40% of the overall sample, followed by physicians (22.2%), interns (10.8%), midwives (10.3%) and others (16.7%). An overall shortage of PPE was reported in all study hospitals. The majority (77%) of the healthcare professionals reported that their hospital did not have adequate PPE. A critical shortage of N95 respirator was particularly reported, the self-reported availability of N95 increased from 13% to 24% before and during COVID-19, respectively. The self-reported use of N95 increased from 9% to 21% before and during COVID-19, respectively. Almost 72% of the respondents were dissatisfied with the availability of PPE in their hospital. The independent predictors of the respondents satisfaction level about PPE were male gender (adjusted OR=1.39, 95% CI:1.05-1.85), healthcare workers who reported that PPE was adequately available in the hospital (adjusted OR=7.53, 95% CI:5.08-11.16), and preparedness to provide care to COVID-19 cases (adjusted OR=1.65, 95% CI:1.22-2.12). A critical shortage of appropriate PPE both before and during COVID-19 was identified. The high level of dissatisfaction with the availability of PPE might potentially lead to a lower level of preparedness and readiness to fight against COVID-19.

Therefore fundamental questions relevant to impacts of systemic viral infection on brain function and integrity remain. Here, we studied innate immune-inducing properties of poly I:C preparations of different lengths and responses in adult and aged mice. High molecular weight (HMW) poly I:C (1–6 kb, 12 mg/kg) produced more robust sickness behavior and more robust IL-6, IFN-I and TNF-α responses than poly I:C of < 500 bases (low MW) preparations. This was partly overcome with higher doses of LMW (up to 80 mg/kg), but neither circulating IFNβ nor brain transcription of Irf7 were significantly induced by LMW poly I:C, despite brain Ifnb transcription, suggesting that brain IFN-dependent gene expression is predominantly triggered by circulating IFNβ binding of IFNAR1. In aged animals, poly I:C induced exaggerated IL-6, IL-1β and IFN-I in the plasma and similar exaggerated brain cytokine responses. This was associated with acute working memory deficits selectively in aged mice. Thus, we demonstrate dsRNA length-, IFNAR1- and age-dependent effects on anti-viral inflammation and cognitive function. The data have implications for CNS symptoms of acute systemic viral infection such as those with SARS-CoV-2 and for models of maternal immune activation.","McGarry, Niamh; Murray, Carol L.; Garvey, Sean; Wilkinson, Abigail; Tortorelli, Lucas; Ryan, Lucy; Hayden, Lorna; Healy, Daire; Griffin, Eadaoin W.; Hennessy, Edel; Arumugam, Malathy; Skelly, Donal T.; Mitchell, Kevin J.; Cunningham, Colm",Brain Behav Immun,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889159121001732; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33892139/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0889159121001732; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2021.04.016,650

The purpose of the research was to determine the real impact of asymptomatic/mild SARS-CoV-2 infection on preterm birth not due to maternal respiratory failure. This case-control study involved women admitted to Sant Anna Hospital, Turin, for delivery between 20 September 2020 and 9 January 2021. The cumulative incidence of Coronavirus disease-19 was compared between preterm birth (case group, n = 102) and full-term delivery (control group, n = 127). Only women with spontaneous or medically-indicated preterm birth because of placental vascular malperfusion (pregnancy-related hypertension and its complications) were included. Current or past SARS-CoV-2 infection was determined by nasopharyngeal swab testing and detection of IgM/IgG antibodies in blood samples. A significant difference in the cumulative incidence of Coronavirus disease-19 between the case (21/102, 20.5%) and the control group (32/127, 25.1%) (P= 0.50) was not observed, although the case group was burdened by a higher prevalence of three known risk factors (body mass index > 24.9, asthma, chronic hypertension) for severe Coronavirus disease-19. Logistic regression analysis showed that asymptomatic/mild SARS-CoV-2 infection was not an independent predictor of spontaneous and medically-indicated preterm birth due to pregnancy-related hypertension and its complications (0.77; 95% confidence interval, 0.41-1.43). Pregnant patients without comorbidities need to be reassured that asymptomatic/mild SARS-CoV-2 infection does not increase the risk of preterm delivery. Preterm birth and severe Coronavirus disease-19 share common risk factors (i.e., body mass index > 24.9, asthma, chronic hypertension), which may explain the high rate of indicated preterm birth due to maternal conditions reported in the literature.","Cosma, Stefano; Carosso, Andrea Roberto; Cusato, Jessica; Borella, Fulvio; Carosso, Marco; Gervasoni, Fiammetta; Stura, Ilaria; Preti, Mario; Ghisetti, Valeria; Di Perri, Giovanni; Benedetto, Chiara",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254875; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34351922/,650
668176,Probenecid Inhibits SARS-CoV-2 Replication In Vivo and In Vitro,2021-05-21,"Apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like (APOBEC) proteins are a diverse and evolutionarily conserved family of cytidine deaminases that provide a variety of functions from tissue-specific gene expression and immunoglobulin diversity to control of viruses and retrotransposons. APOBEC family expansion has been documented among mammalian species, suggesting a powerful selection for their activity. Enzymes with a duplicated zinc-binding domain often have catalytically active and inactive domains, yet both have antiviral function. Although APOBEC antiviral function was discovered through hypermutation of HIV-1 genomes lacking an active Vif protein, much evidence indicates that APOBECs also inhibit virus replication through mechanisms other than mutagenesis. Multiple steps of the viral replication cycle may be affected, although nucleic acid replication is a primary target. Packaging of APOBECs into virions was first noted with HIV-1, yet is not a prerequisite for viral inhibition. APOBEC antagonism may occur in viral producer and recipient cells. Signatures of APOBEC activity include G-to-A and C-to-T mutations in a particular sequence context. The importance of APOBEC activity for viral inhibition is reflected in the identification of numerous viral factors, including HIV-1 Vif, which are dedicated to antagonism of these deaminases. Such viral antagonists often are only partially successful, leading to APOBEC selection for viral variants that enhance replication or avoid immune elimination.","Xu, Wendy Kaichun; Byun, Hyewon; Dudley, Jaquelin P.",Microorganisms,https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms8121899; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33266042/,650

METHODS: A comprehensive systematic literature search of the databases of PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Medline, Cochrane and MedRxiv, was carried out. RESULTS: The presence of orchitis as a potential complication of the infection by SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been confirmed. One study reported that 19% of males with COVID-19 infection had scrotal symptoms suggestive of viral orchitis which could not be confirmed. It is possible that the virus, rather than infecting the testes directly, may induce a secondary autoimmune response leading to autoimmune orchitis. COVID-19 has been associated with coagulation disorders and thus the orchitis could be the result of segmental vasculitis. Existing data concerning the presence of the virus in semen are contradictory. Only one study reported the presence of RNA in 15.8% of patients with COVID-19. However, the presence of nucleic acid or antigen in semen is not synonyms of viral replication capacity and infectivity. It has been reported an increase in serum levels of LH in males with COVID-19 and a significant reduction in the T/LH and FSH/LH ratios, consistent with subclinical hypogonadism. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of recent reports related to the potential effects of COVID-19 infection on the male reproductive system are based on poorly designed, small sample size studies that provide inconclusive, contradictory results. Since there still exists a theoretical possibility of testicular damage and male infertilty as a result of the infection by COVID-19, males of reproductive age should be evaluated for gonadal function and semen analysis. With regard to the sexual transmission of the virus, there is not sufficient evidence to recommend asymptomatic couples to abstein from having sex in order to protect themselves from being infected by the virus. Additional studies are needed to understand the long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 on male reproductive function, including male fertility potential and endocrine testicular function.","José, Ferran García; González, Juan G.

In the absence of evidence, individual communities had to take timely action to reduce the rate of disease spread and avoid overburdening their healthcare systems. Although a few predictive models have been published to guide these decisions, most have not taken into account spatial differences and have included assumptions that do not match the local realities. Access to reliable information that is adapted to local context is critical for policymakers to make informed decisions during a rapidly evolving pandemic. Objective: The goal of this study was to develop an adapted susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model to predict the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic in North Carolina and the Charlotte metropolitan region and to incorporate the effect of a public health intervention to reduce disease spread, while accounting for unique regional features and imperfect detection. Methods: Three SIR models were fit to prevalence data from the state and the greater Charlotte region and then rigorously compared. One of these models (SIR-Int) accounted for a stay-at-home intervention and imperfect detection of COVID-19 cases. Results: Presently, the COVID-19 outbreak is rapidly decelerating in NC and the Charlotte region. Infection curves are flattening at both the state and regional level. Relatively speaking, the greater Charlotte region has responded more favorably to the stay-at-home intervention than NC as a whole. While an initial basic SIR model served the purpose of informing decision making in the early days of the pandemic, its forecast increasingly did not fit the data over time. However, as the pandemic and local conditions evolved, the SIR-Int model provided a good fit to the data. Conclusions: Using local data and continuous attention to model adaptation, our findings have enabled policymakers, public health officials and health systems to do capacity planning and evaluate the impact of a public health intervention. Our SIR-Int model for estimated latent prevalence was reasonably flexible, highly accurate, and demonstrated the efficacy of a stay-at-home order at both the state and regional level. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating local context into pandemic forecast modeling, as well as the need to remain vigilant and informed by the data as we enter into a critical period of the outbreak.","Turk, P.

This study aims at assessing several scenarios of delivering the vaccine to people in Indonesia. We develop a model for several scenarios of delivering vaccines: without vaccination, fair distribution, and targeted distribution to five and eight districts with the highest COVID-19 incidence in West Java, one of the most COVID-19-affected regions in Indonesia. We calculate the needs of vaccines and healthcare staff for the program, then simulate the model for the initial 4-month and one-year scenarios. A one-year vaccination program would require 232,000 inoculations per day by 4833 vaccinators. Targeted vaccine allocation based on the burden of COVID-19 cases could benefit the COVID-19 vaccination program by lowering at least 5000 active cases. The benefits would increase by improving the number of vaccines and healthcare staff. Amidst lacking available vaccines, targeted vaccine allocation based on the burden of COVID-19 cases could increase the benefit of the COVID-19 vaccination program but still requires progressive efforts to improve healthcare capacity and vaccine availability for optimal protection for people.","Fuady, Ahmad; Nuraini, Nuning; Sukandar, Kamal K.; Lestari, Bony W.",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34066317/; https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9050462,650

Through early detection of an infectious disease, the outbreak can be contained at the local level, thereby reducing adverse effects on populations. Significant time and funding have been invested to improve disease detection timeliness. However, current evaluation methods do not provide evidence-based suggestions or measurements on how to detect outbreaks earlier. Key conditions for earlier detection and their influencing factors remain unclear and unmeasured. Without clarity about conditions and influencing factors, attempts to improve disease detection remain ad hoc and unsystematic. Methods: We developed a generic five-step disease detection model and a novel methodology to use for data collection, analysis, and interpretation. Data was collected in two workshops in Southeast Europe (n = 33 participants) and Southern and East Africa (n = 19 participants), representing mid- and low-income countries. Through systematic, qualitative, and quantitative data analyses, we identified key conditions for earlier detection and prioritized factors that influence them. As participants joined a workshop format and not an experimental setting, no ethics approval was required. Findings: Our analyses suggest that governance is the most important condition for earlier detection in both regions. Facilitating factors for earlier detection are risk communication activities such as information sharing, communication, and collaboration activities. Impeding factors are lack of communication, coordination, and leadership. Interpretation: Governance and risk communication are key influencers for earlier detection in both regions. However, inadequate technical capacity, commonly assumed to be a leading factor impeding early outbreak detection, was not found a leading factor. This insight may be used to pinpoint further improvement strategies.","Steele, Lindsay; Orefuwa, Emma; Bino, Silvia; Singer, Shepherd Roee; Lutwama, Julius; Dickmann, Petra",Front Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33014967/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.00452,650

Demographic information and clinical features were retrospectively collected. Notably, a comparison between the DVT and the non-DVT groups was explored. The incidence rate of venous thrombosis was 35.2% (50 patients out of 142). Moreover, the location of thrombus at the proximal extremity veins was 5.6% (n = 8), while at distal extremity veins was 35.2% (n = 50) of the patients.

671889,HTCC as a Polymeric Inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV,2021-01-28,"Tuberculosis (TB), caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is one of the principal causes of death in the world despite the existence of a significant number of antibiotics aimed against it. This is mainly due to the drug resistance mechanisms present in the bacterium, which leads to multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Additionally, the development of new antibiotics has become limited over the years. Although there are various drug resistance mechanisms present, efflux pumps are of utmost importance because they extrude out several dissimilar antitubercular drugs out of the cell. There are many efflux pump proteins present in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Therefore, blocking these efflux pumps by inhibitors can raise the efficacy of the existing antibiotics and may also pave the path for the discovery and synthesis of new drugs. Plant compounds can act as a resource for the development of efflux pump inhibitors (EPIs), which may eventually replace or augment the current therapeutic options. This is mainly because plants have been traditionally used for ages for food or treatment and are considered safe with little or no side effects. Various computational tools are available which are used for the virtual screening of a large number of phytocompounds within a short span of time. This review aims to highlight the mechanism and appearance of drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis with emphasis on efflux pumps along with the significance of phytochemicals as inhibitors of these pumps and their screening strategy by computational approaches.","Biswas, Santasree Sarma; Browne, Rene Barbie; Borah, Vedant Vikrom; Roy, Jayanti Datta",Appl Biochem Biotechnol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12010-021-03557-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33826064/,650

672294,A simple protein-based surrogate neutralization assay for SARS-CoV-2,2020-10-02,"Many viruses achieve reversible attachment to sialic acid (Sia) by encoding envelope glycoproteins with receptor-binding and receptor-destroying activities. Toroviruses and group 2 coronaviruses bind to O-acetylated Sias, presumably via their spike proteins (S), whereas other glycoproteins, the hemagglutinin-esterases (HE), destroy Sia receptors by de-O-acetylation. Here, we present a comprehensive study of these enzymes. Sialate-9-O-acetylesterases specific for 5-N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid, described for bovine and human coronaviruses, also occur in equine coronaviruses and in porcine toroviruses. Bovine toroviruses, however, express novel sialate-9-O-acetylesterases, which prefer the di-O-acetylated substrate 5-N-acetyl-7(8),9-di-O-acetylneuraminic acid. Whereas most rodent coronaviruses express sialate-4-O-acetylesterases, the HE of murine coronavirus DVIM cleaves 9-O-acetylated Sias. Under the premise that HE specificity reflects receptor usage, we propose that two types of Sias serve as initial attachment factors for coronaviruses in mice. There are striking parallels between orthomyxo- and nidovirus biology. Reminiscent of antigenic shifts in orthomyxoviruses, rodent coronaviruses exchanged S and HE sequences through recombination to extents not appreciated before. As for orthomyxovirus reassortants, the fitness of nidovirus recombinant offspring probably depends both on antigenic properties and on compatibility of receptor-binding and receptor-destroying activities.","Smits, Saskia L.; Gerwig, Gerrit J.; van Vliet, Arno L.W.; Lissenberg, Arjen; Briza, Peter; Kamerling, Johannis P.; Vlasak, Reinhard; de Groot, Raoul J.",J Biol Chem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15507445/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021925819628103; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925819628103,650

672742,Biophysical analysis of SARS‐CoV‐2 transmission and theranostic development via N protein computational characterization,2020-10-29,"OBJECTIVES: 1) To compare the 2-year completed suicide and reattempt rates in a preintervention group of Hong Kong Chinese suicide attempters (aged 65 years and older) who received standard care and a postintervention group enrolled in a regional elderly suicide prevention program (ESPP) that adopts a two-tiered multifaceted care management model and 2) to examine the trend of suicide rates in older adults aged 65 years and older in the pre- and postintervention periods. DESIGN: The first part is an observational cohort study with baseline, follow-up, and outcome data being identified from a clinical electronic registry. The second part examines changes in suicide rates from official mortality statistics. SETTING: A government-funded suicide intervention program serving catchment population (852,796 people aged 65 years and older) in Hong Kong, China. PARTICIPANTS: Suicide attempters (aged 65 years and older) presenting to old-age psychiatric service in the pre- and postintervention phases. MEASUREMENTS: 1) Two-year rates of completed suicide and suicide reattempt and 2) changes in population suicide rates in the pre- and postintervention periods. RESULTS: The 2-year completed suicide rate was 7.58% in the preintervention group (N = 66) and 1.99$% in the ESPP group (N = 351) χ(2) = 6.192; p value: 0.028; df = 1). Reattempt rates were not different. At a population level, suicide rate dropped significantly only in women aged 85 years and older, relative to the preintervention period. CONCLUSIONS: The ESPP was associated with a reduced rate of completed suicide in old-age suicide attempters and might have contributed to a fall of suicide rate in women aged 85 years and older.","Chan, Sandra S.; Leung, Vivian P.Y.; Tsoh, Joshua; Li, S.W.; Yu, C.S.; Yu, Gabriel K.K.; Poon, T.K.; Pan, P.C.; Chan, W.F.; Conwell, Yeates; Lam, Linda C.W.; Chiu, Helen F.K.",Am J Geriatr Psychiatry,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S106474811260164X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20808109/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S106474811260164X; https://doi.org/10.1097/jgp.0b013e3181e56d0f,650

The aim of the study was to determine facility usage and gather insight into employee wellbeing and the views of employees towards this provision. The study included (i) 17-week service use monitoring, (ii) employee online survey with measures of wellbeing, job stressfulness, presenteeism, turnover intentions, job satisfaction, and work engagement, as well as barriers and facilitators to accessing the Wellbeing Centres. Over 17 weeks, 14,934 facility visits were recorded across two sites (peak attendance in single week n = 2605). Facilities were highly valued, but the service model was resource intensive with 134 wellbeing buddies supporting the centres in pairs. 819 hospital employees completed an online survey (88% female; 37.7% working in COVID-19 high risk areas; 52.4% frontline workers; 55.2% had accessed a wellbeing centre). There was moderate-to-high job stress (62.9%), low wellbeing (26.1%), presenteeism (68%), and intentions to leave (31.6%). Wellbeing was higher in those that accessed a wellbeing centre. Work engagement and job satisfaction were high. Healthcare organisations are urged to mobilise access to high-quality rest spaces and psychological first aid, but this should be localised and diversified. Strategies to address presenteeism and staff retention should be prioritised, and the high dedication of healthcare workers should be recognised.","Blake, Holly; Yildirim, Mehmet; Wood, Ben; Knowles, Steph; Mancini, Helen; Coyne, Emma; Cooper, Joanne",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33333913/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17249401,650

Methods: We performed an international survey of practitioners, scientists, and trainees from 21 neuro-oncology organizations across 6 continents, April 24–May 17, 2020. We assessed clinical practice and research environments; institutional preparedness and support; and perceived impact on patients. RESULTS: Of 582 respondents, 258 (45%) were US-based, and 314 (55%) international. 94% participants reported changes in their clinical practice. 95% respondents converted at least some practice to telemedicine. 10% practitioners felt the need to see patients in person, specifically because of billing concerns and pressure from their institutions. 67% practitioners suspended enrollment for at least one clinical trial, including 62% suspending phase III trial enrollments. Over 50% believed neuro-oncology patients were at increased risk for COVID-19. 71% clinicians feared for their own personal safety or that of their families, specifically because of their clinical duties; 20% had inadequate PPE. While 69% reported increased stress, 44% received no psychosocial support from their institutions. 37% had salary reductions and 63% researchers temporarily closed their laboratories. However, the pandemic created positive changes in perceived patient satisfaction, communication quality, and technology use to deliver care and mediate interactions with other practitioners. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic has changed treatment schedules and limited investigational treatment options. Institutional lack of support created clinician and researcher anxiety. Communication with patients was satisfactory. We make recommendations to guide clinical and scientific infrastructure moving forward, and address the personal challenges of providers and researchers.","Mrugala, Maciej M; Ostrom, Quinn T; Pressley, Shelley M; Taylor, Jennie; Thomas, Alissa A; Wefel, Jeffrey S; Coven, Scott L; Acquaye, Alvina A; Haynes, Chas; Agnihotri, Sameer; Lim, Michael; Peters, Katherine B; Sulman, Erik P; Salcido, Joanne T; Butowski, Nicholas A; Hervey-Jumper, Shawn; Mansouri, Alireza; Oliver, Kathy R; Porter, Alyx B; Nassiri, F; Schiff, D; Dunbar, Erin M; Hegi, Monika E; Armstrong, Terri S; van den Bent, Martin J; Chang, Susan M; Zadeh, Gelareh; Chheda, Milan G",Neurooncol Adv,https://doi.org/10.1093/noajnl/vdab035; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34007966/,650

The pharmacy profession has a long history of dispensing and compounding, with the addition of clinical roles in the late 20th century. These clinical roles have continued to expand into diverse arenas such as communicable and non-communicable diseases, antimicrobial stewardship, emergency preparedness and response, public health education and health promotion, and critical and emergency care. Pharmacists continue to serve as integral members of interprofessional and interdisciplinary healthcare teams. In this context, CPAs allow pharmacists to expand their roles in patient care and may be considered as a step towards securing provider status. Moving beyond CPAs to a provider status would enable pharmacists to be reimbursed for cognitive services and promote integrated public health delivery models.","Cernasev, Alina; Aruru, Meghana; Clark, Suzanne; Patel, Komal; DiPietro Mager, Natalie; Subramaniam, Vaiyapuri; Truong, Hoai-An",Pharmacy (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmacy9010057; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33803293/,650

By combining qualitative content analysis with ethnographic observations of public ReOpen groups on Facebook, this paper provides a better understanding of the central narratives circulating among ReOpen members and the information they relied on to support their arguments. Grounded in notions of individualism and self-inquiry, members sought to reinterpret datasets to downplay the threat of COVID and suggest public safety workarounds.

PDT is considered a high-risk procedure for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to healthcare workers (HCWs). The present study analyzed the optimal timing of PDT, the clinical outcomes of patients undergoing PDT, and the safety of HCWs performing PDT. Methods: Of the 133 COVID-19 patients who underwent PDT in our ICU from 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021, 13 patients were excluded, and 120 patients were enrolled. A trained medical team was dedicated to the PDT procedure. Demographic, clinical history, and outcome data were collected. Patients who underwent PDT were stratified into two groups: an early group (PDT ≤ 12 days after orotracheal intubation (OTI) and a late group (>12 days after OTI). An HCW surveillance program was also performed. Results: The early group included 61 patients and the late group included 59 patients. The early group patients had a shorter ICU length of stay and fewer days of mechanical ventilation than the late group (p < 0.001). On day 7 after tracheostomy, early group patients required fewer intravenous anesthetic drugs and experienced an improvement of the ventilation parameters PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio, PEEP, and FiO(2) (p < 0.001). No difference in the case fatality ratio between the two groups was observed. No SARS-CoV-2 infections were reported in the HCWs performing the PDTs. Conclusions: PDT was safe and effective for COVID-19 patients since it improved respiratory support parameters, reduced ICU length of stay and duration of mechanical ventilation, and optimized the weaning process. The procedure was safe for all HCWs involved in the dedicated medical team. The development of standardized early PDT protocols should be implemented, and PDT could be considered a first-line approach in ICU COVID-19 patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation.","Tetaj, Nardi; Maritti, Micaela; Stazi, Giulia; Marini, Maria Cristina; Centanni, Daniele; Garotto, Gabriele; Caravella, Ilaria; Dantimi, Cristina; Fusetti, Matteo; Santagata, Carmen; Macchione, Manuela; De Angelis, Giada; Giansante, Filippo; Busso, Donatella; Di Lorenzo, Rachele; Scarcia, Silvana; Carucci, Alessandro; Cabas, Ricardo; Gaviano, Ilaria; Petrosillo, Nicola; Antinori, Andrea; Palmieri, Fabrizio; D’Offizi, Gianpiero; Ianniello, Stefania; Campioni, Paolo; Pugliese, Francesco; Vaia, Francesco; Nicastri, Emanuele; Ippolito, Giuseppe; Marchioni, Luisa",J Clin Med,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10153335; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34362118/,650

The epidemic accelerated in Philadelphia, PA, in the spring of 2020, with the city experiencing a first peak of infections on 15 April, followed by a decline through midsummer. Here, we investigate spread of the epidemic in the first wave in Philadelphia using full-genome sequencing of 52 SARS-CoV-2 samples obtained from 27 hospitalized patients collected between 30 March and 17 July 2020. Sequences most commonly resembled lineages circulating at earlier times in New York, suggesting transmission primarily from this location, though a minority of Philadelphia genomes matched sequences from other sites, suggesting additional introductions. Multiple genomes showed even closer matches to other Philadelphia isolates, suggestive of ongoing transmission within Philadelphia. We found that all of our isolates contained the D614G substitution in the viral spike and belong to lineages variously designated B.1, Nextstrain clade 20A or 20C, and GISAID clade G or GH. There were no viral sequence polymorphisms detectably associated with disease outcome. For some patients, genome sequences were determined longitudinally or concurrently from multiple body sites. In both cases, some comparisons showed reproducible polymorphisms, suggesting initial seeding with multiple variants and/or accumulation of polymorphisms after infection. These results thus provide data on the sources of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Philadelphia and begin to explore the dynamics within hospitalized patients.","Everett, John; Hokama, Pascha; Roche, Aoife M.; Reddy, Shantan; Hwang, Young; Kessler, Lyanna; Glascock, Abigail; Li, Yize; Whelan, Jillian N.; Weiss, Susan R.; Sherrill-Mix, Scott; McCormick, Kevin; Whiteside, Samantha A.; Graham-Wooten, Jevon; Khatib, Layla A.; Fitzgerald, Ayannah S.; Collman, Ronald G.; Bushman, Frederic",mBio,https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.03456-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33468702/,650

Two virus-encoded, non-structural proteins, NSP2 and NSP5, are the main drivers of viroplasm formation. The structures (as far as is known) and functions of these proteins are described. Recent studies using plasmid-only-based reverse genetics have significantly contributed to elucidation of the crucial roles of these proteins in RV replication. Thus, it has been recognized that viroplasms resemble liquid-like protein–RNA condensates that may be formed via liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) of NSP2 and NSP5 at the early stages of infection. Interactions between the RNA chaperone NSP2 and the multivalent, intrinsically disordered protein NSP5 result in their condensation (protein droplet formation), which plays a central role in viroplasm assembly. These droplets may provide a unique molecular environment for the establishment of inter-molecular contacts between the RV (+)ssRNA transcripts, followed by their assortment and equimolar packaging. Future efforts to improve our understanding of RV replication and genome assortment in viroplasms should focus on their complex molecular composition, which changes dynamically throughout the RV replication cycle, to support distinct stages of virion assembly.","Papa, Guido; Borodavka, Alexander; Desselberger, Ulrich",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34372555/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v13071349,650

How and when to ease restrictions to movement hinges in part on whether SARS‐CoV2 will display seasonality due to variations in temperature, humidity, and hours of sunshine. Here, we address this question by means of a spatio‐temporal analysis in Spain of the incidence of COVID‐19, the disease caused by the virus. Use of spatial Seemingly Unrelated Regressions (SUR) allows us to model the incidence of reported cases of the disease per 100,000 population as an interregional contagion process, in addition to a function of temperature, humidity, and sunshine. In the analysis we also control for GDP per capita, percentage of older adults in the population, population density, and presence of mass transit systems. The results support the hypothesis that incidence of the disease is lower at higher temperatures and higher levels of humidity. Sunshine, in contrast, displays a positive association with incidence of the disease. Our control variables also yield interesting insights. Higher incidence is associated with higher GDP per capita and presence of mass transit systems in the province; in contrast, population density and percentage of older adults display negative associations with incidence of COVID‐19.","Paez, Antonio; Lopez, Fernando A.; Menezes, Tatiane; Cavalcanti, Renata; Pitta, Maira Galdino da Rocha",Geogr Anal,https://doi.org/10.1111/gean.12241; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32836331/,650

Our aim was to compare patients hospitalized for COVID-19 with cancer to those without cancer using national data and to study the effect of cancer on the risk of hospital death and intensive care unit admission. This study shows that, in France, patients with COVID-19 and cancer have a two-fold risk of death when compared to COVID-19 patients without cancer. This study also provides information about the types of cancer for which the prognosis is worse, such as hematological cancers and, among solid tumours, all metastatic cancers but also lung cancers. Our results reinforce the need to implement an organization within facilities to prevent the contamination of patients being treated for cancer and the importance of all measures of physical prevention and of vaccination. ABSTRACT: (1) Background: Several smaller studies have shown that COVID-19 patients with cancer are at a significantly higher risk of death. Our objective was to compare patients hospitalized for COVID-19 with cancer to those without cancer using national data and to study the effect of cancer on the risk of hospital death and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. (2) Methods: All patients hospitalized in France for COVID-19 in March–April 2020 were included from the French national administrative database, which contains discharge summaries for all hospital admissions in France. Cancer patients were identified within this population. The effect of cancer was estimated with logistic regression, adjusting for age, sex and comorbidities. (3) Results: Among the 89,530 COVID-19 patients, we identified 6201 cancer patients (6.9%). These patients were older and were more likely to be men and to have complications (acute respiratory and kidney failure, venous thrombosis, atrial fibrillation) than those without cancer. In patients with hematological cancer, admission to ICU was significantly more frequent (24.8%) than patients without cancer (16.4%) (p < 0.01). Solid cancer patients without metastasis had a significantly higher mortality risk than patients without cancer (aOR = 1.4 [1.3–1.5]), and the difference was even more marked for metastatic solid cancer patients (aOR = 3.6 [3.2–4.0]). Compared to patients with colorectal cancer, patients with lung cancer, digestive cancer (excluding colorectal cancer) and hematological cancer had a higher mortality risk (aOR = 2.0 [1.6–2.6], 1.6 [1.3–2.1] and 1.4 [1.1–1.8], respectively). (4) Conclusions: This study shows that, in France, patients with COVID-19 and cancer have a two-fold risk of death when compared to COVID-19 patients without cancer. We suggest the need to reorganize facilities to prevent the contamination of patients being treated for cancer, similar to what is already being done in some countries.","Bernard, Alain; Cottenet, Jonathan; Bonniaud, Philippe; Piroth, Lionel; Arveux, Patrick; Tubert-Bitter, Pascale; Quantin, Catherine",Cancers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33801131/; https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers13061436,650

It is essential to develop diagnostic tests that can quickly identify infected individuals to limit the spread of the virus and assign treatment options. Herein, we report a proof-of-concept label-free electrochemical immunoassay for the rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus via the spike surface protein. The assay consists of a graphene working electrode functionalized with anti-spike antibodies. The concept of the immunosensor is to detect the signal perturbation obtained from ferri/ferrocyanide measurements after binding of the antigen during 45 min of incubation with a sample. The absolute change in the [Fe(CN)(6)](3)−/(4−) current upon increasing antigen concentrations on the immunosensor surface was used to determine the detection range of the spike protein. The sensor was able to detect a specific signal above 260 nM (20 µg/mL) of subunit 1 of recombinant spike protein. Additionally, it was able to detect SARS-CoV-2 at a concentration of 5.5 × 10(5) PFU/mL, which is within the physiologically relevant concentration range. The novel immunosensor has a significantly faster analysis time than the standard qPCR and is operated by a portable device which can enable on-site diagnosis of infection.","Mojsoska, Biljana; Larsen, Sylvester; Olsen, Dorte Aalund; Madsen, Jonna Skov; Brandslund, Ivan; Alatraktchi, Fatima AlZahra’a",Sensors (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/s21020390; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33429915/,650
677977,The effect of spike mutations on SARS-CoV-2 neutralization,2021-03-06,"Due to the rapid changes that have occurred in the field of drug discovery and the recent developments in the early 21st century, the role of drug delivery systems (DDS) has become increasingly more important. For the past 20 years, our laboratory has been developing gene delivery systems based on lipid-based delivery systems. One of our efforts has been directed toward developing a multifunctional envelope-type nano device (MEND) by modifying the particle surface with octaarginine, which resulted in a remarkably enhanced cellular uptake and improved intracellular trafficking of plasmid DNA (pDNA). When we moved to in vivo applications, however, we were faced with the PEG-dilemma and we shifted our strategy to the incorporation of ionizable cationic lipids into our system. This resulted in some dramatic improvements over our original design and this can be attributed to the development of a new lipid library. We have also developed a mitochondrial targeting system based on a membrane fusion mechanism using a MITO-Porter, which can deliver nucleic acids/pDNA into the matrix of mitochondria. After the appearance of antibody medicines, Opdivo, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, has established cancer immunology as the 4th strategy in cancer therapy. Our DDS technologies can also be applied to this new field of cancer therapy to cure cancer by controlling our immune mechanisms. The latest studies are summarized in this review article.","Yamada, Yuma; Sato, Yusuke; Nakamura, Takashi; Harashima, Hideyoshi",J Control Release,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168365920305149?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168365920305149; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32916227/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2020.09.007,650
678544,Fractal and inertia moment analysis of SARS CoV-2 proliferation through replication,2020-10-06,"Evidence from randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses has shown that early integration of specialized palliative care improves symptoms and quality of life for patients with advanced cancer. There are various models of early integration, which may be classified based on setting of care and method of palliative care referral. Most successful randomized controlled trials of early palliative care have used a model of specialized teams providing in-person palliative care in free-standing or embedded outpatient clinics. During the COVID-19 pandemic, telehealth has become a prominent model for palliative care delivery. This model of care has been well received by patients and palliative care providers, although evidence to date is limited. Despite evidence from trials that routine early integration of palliative care into oncology care improves patient outcomes, referral to palliative care still occurs mostly according to the judgment of individual oncologists. This hinders equitable access to palliative care and to its known benefits for patients and their caregivers. Automated referral based on triggering criteria is being actively explored as an alternative. In particular, routine technology-assisted symptom screening, combined with targeted needs-based automatic referral to outpatient palliative care, may improve integration and ultimately increase quality of life.","Mathews, Jean; Hannon, Breffni; Zimmermann, Camilla",Curr Treat Options Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33830352/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11864-021-00836-1,650

This study aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 and identify the risk factors for severe illness of COVID-19 in Jiangsu province, China. Clinical data of hospitalized COVID-19 patients were retrospectively collected in 8 hospitals from 8 cities of Jiangsu province, China. Clinical findings of COVID-19 patients were described and risk factors for severe illness of COVID-19 were analyzed. By Feb 10, 2020, 202 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. The median age of patients was 44.0 years (interquartile range, 33.0–54.0). 55 (27.2%) patients had comorbidities. At the onset of illness, the common symptoms were fever (156 [77.2%]) and cough (120 [59.4%]). 66 (32.7%) patients had lymphopenia. 193 (95.5%) patients had abnormal radiological findings. 11 (5.4%) patients were admitted to the intensive care unit and none of the patients died. 23 (11.4%) patients had severe illness.

We did a systematic review of articles published between 1990 and 2011 reporting at least one of 13 pathogens in children <5 years of age hospitalized with diarrhea. We included 2011 rotavirus data from the Rotavirus Surveillance Network coordinated by WHO. We excluded studies conducted during diarrhea outbreaks that did not discriminate between inpatient and outpatient cases, reporting nosocomial infections, those conducted in special populations, not done with adequate methods, and rotavirus studies in countries where the rotavirus vaccine was used. Age-adjusted median proportions for each pathogen were calculated and applied to 712 000 deaths due to diarrhea in children under 5 years for 2011, assuming that those observed among children hospitalized for diarrhea represent those causing child diarrhea deaths. 163 articles and WHO studies done in 31 countries were selected representing 286 inpatient studies. Studies seeking only one pathogen found higher proportions for some pathogens than studies seeking multiple pathogens (e.g. 39% rotavirus in 180 single-pathogen studies vs. 20% in 24 studies with 5–13 pathogens, p<0·0001). The percentage of episodes for which no pathogen could be identified was estimated to be 34%; the total of all age-adjusted percentages for pathogens and no-pathogen cases was 138%. Adjusting all proportions, including unknowns, to add to 100%, we estimated that rotavirus caused 197 000 [Uncertainty range (UR) 110 000–295 000], enteropathogenic E. coli 79 000 (UR 31 000–146 000), calicivirus 71 000 (UR 39 000–113 000), and enterotoxigenic E. coli 42 000 (UR 20 000–76 000) deaths.

There is limited information about the clinical characteristics and events leading to acute kidney injury (AKI). We described the factors associated with the development of AKI and explored the relation of AKI and mortality in Mexican population with severe COVID-19. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of individuals with severe pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 hospitalized at the largest third-level reference institution for COVID-19 care in Mexico between March and April 2020. Demographic information, comorbidities, clinical and laboratory data, dates of mechanical ventilation and hospitalization, mechanical-ventilator settings and use of vasoactive drugs were recorded. Results: Of 99 patients studied, 58 developed AKI (58.6%). The group with AKI had higher body mass index (p=0.0003) and frequency of obesity (p=0.001); a higher requirement of invasive mechanical ventilation (p=0.008) and vasoactive drugs (p=0.004); greater levels of serum creatinine (p<0.001) and D-dimer on admission (p<0.001); and lower lymphocyte counts (p=0.001) than the non-AKI group. The multivariate analysis indicated that risk factors for AKI were obesity (adjusted hazard ratio (HR)=2.71, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.33-5.51, p=0.005); higher serum creatinine (HR=1.44, CI=1.02-2.02, p=0.035) and D-dimer levels on admission (HR=1.14, CI=1.06-1.23, p<0.001). In-hospital mortality was higher in the AKI group than in the non-AKI group (65.5% vs. 14.6%; p=0.001). Conclusions: AKI was common in our cohort of patients with severe COVID-19 and it was associated with mortality. The risk factors for AKI were obesity, elevated creatinine levels and higher D-dimer levels on admission.

Objective To describe persisting symptoms more than 3 months after infection in PCR-confirmed COVID-19 in comparison to negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR outpatients and to identify predictors of long-term symptoms in COVID-19. Setting Outpatient clinics of a Swiss university center. Patients 418 symptomatic outpatients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 (COVID-positive) and 89 negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR (COVID-negative). Design Prospective cohort study. Measurements Predefined long-term symptoms were evaluated though a phone interview >3 to 10 months after diagnosis. Associations between long-term symptoms and PCR test result, as well predictors of persisting symptoms in COVID-positive were evaluated by multivariate logistic regression including potential confounders (age, sex, smoking, comorbidities, time of the phone survey). Results The study population consisted mostly of young (median of 41 versus 36 years in COVID-positive and COVID-negative, respectively; p=0.020) health care workers (67% versus 82%; p=0.006).. Persisting symptoms were reported by 223 (53%) COVID-positive and 33 (37%) COVID-negative (p=0.006). Overall, 21% COVID-positive and 15% COVID-negative (p=0.182) consulted a doctor for these symptoms. Four surveyed symptoms were independently associated with COVID-19: fatigue (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.14, 95%CI 1.04-4.41), smell/taste disorder (26.5, 3.46-202), dyspnea (2.81, 1.10-7.16) and memory impairment (5.71, 1.53-21.3). Among COVID-positive, female gender (aOR 1.67, 95% CI 1.09-2.56) and overweight/obesity (1.67, 1.10-2.56) were predictors of persisting symptoms. Limitations Undiagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection in COVID-negative cannot be completely excluded. Conclusion More than half of COVID-positive outpatients report persisting symptoms up to 10 months after infection and 21% seek medical care for this reason. These data suggest that post-COVID syndrome places a significant burden on society and especially healthcare systems.","Desgranges, F.; Tadini, E.; Munting, A.; Regina, J.; Paraskevas, F.; Karachalias, E.; Viala, B.; Suttels, V.; Haefliger, D.; Kampouri, E.; Van Singer, M.; Tschopp, J.; Rochat Stettler, L.; Schaad, S.; Brahier, T.; Hugli, O.; Mueller Chabloz, Y.; Gouveia, A.; Opota, O.; Carron, P.-N.; Guery, B.; Papadimitriou-Olivgeris, M.; Boillat-Blanco, N.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.19.21255742v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.19.21255742,650

Novel technologies show the existence of a staggering number of individual lipid species, the biological functions of which are, with the exception of only a few lipid species, unknown. Much can be learned from pathogens that have evolved to take advantage of the complexity of the lipidome to escape the immune system of the host organism and to allow their survival and replication. Different types of pathogens target different lipids as shown in interaction maps, allowing visualization of differences between different types of pathogens. Bacterial and viral pathogens target predominantly structural and signaling lipids to alter the cellular phenotype of the host cell. Fungal and parasitic pathogens have complex lipidomes themselves and target predominantly the release of polyunsaturated fatty acids from the host cell lipidome, resulting in the generation of eicosanoids by either the host cell or the pathogen. Thus, whereas viruses and bacteria induce predominantly alterations in lipid metabolites at the host cell level, eukaryotic pathogens focus on interference with lipid metabolites affecting systemic inflammatory reactions that are part of the immune system. A better understanding of the interplay between host–pathogen interactions will not only help elucidate the fundamental role of lipid species in cellular physiology, but will also aid in the generation of novel therapeutic drugs.

680867,Protein structural heterogeneity: A hypothesis for the basis of proteolytic recognition by the main protease of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2,2021-01-20,"Background: Morphological alterations in intracranial pressure (ICP) pulse waveform (ICPW) secondary to intracranial hypertension (ICP >20 mmHg) and a reduction in intracranial compliance (ICC) are well known indicators of neurological severity. The exclusive exploration of modifications in ICPW after either the loss of skull integrity or surgical procedures for intracranial hypertension resolution is not a common approach studied. The present study aimed to assess the morphological alterations in ICPW among neurocritical care patients with skull defects and decompressive craniectomy (DC) by comparing the variations in ICPW features according to elevations in mean ICP values. Methods: Patients requiring ICP monitoring because of acute brain injury were included. A continuous record of 10 min-length for the beat-by-beat analysis of ICPW was performed, with ICP elevation produced by means of ultrasound-guided manual internal jugular vein compression at the end of the record. ICPW features (peak amplitude ratio (P2/P1), time interval to pulse peak (TTP) and pulse amplitude) were counterweighed between baseline and compression periods. Results were distributed for three groups: intact skull (exclusive burr hole for ICP monitoring), craniotomy/large fractures (group 2) or DC (group 3). Results: 57 patients were analyzed. A total of 21 (36%) presented no skull defects, 21 (36%) belonged to group 2, whereas 15 (26%) had DC. ICP was not significantly different between groups: ±15.11 for intact, 15.33 for group 2 and ±20.81 mmHg for group 3, with ICP-induced elevation also similar between groups (p = 0.56). Significant elevation was observed for the P2/P1 ratio for groups 1 and 2, whereas a reduction was observed in group 3 (elevation of ±0.09 for groups 1 and 2, but a reduction of 0.03 for group 3, p = 0.01), and no significant results were obtained for TTP and pulse amplitudes. Conclusion: In the present study, intracranial pressure pulse waveform analysis indicated that intracranial compliance was significantly more impaired among decompressive craniectomy patients, although ICPW indicated DC to be protective for further influences of ICP elevations over the brain. The analysis of ICPW seems to be an alternative to real-time ICC assessment.","Brasil, Sérgio; Solla, Davi Jorge Fontoura; Nogueira, Ricardo de Carvalho; Jacobsen Teixeira, Manoel; Malbouisson, Luiz Marcelo Sá; Paiva, Wellingson Silva",Brain Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34439590/; https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci11080971,650

However, certain patients may not need staff escort and are able to ambulate from ED to MI by themselves. This would reduce waiting time from when the X-ray is ordered to X-ray being done, which may reduce overall ED length of stay and improve patients’ experience. Our project aim is to decrease the time to X-ray by 50% within 6 months by having appropriate ambulatory patients walk from the ED to the X-ray department without a porter. To achieve our goal, several strategies were employed. First, brainstorm sessions were held to better understand the barriers and ways to implement the new process. Second, a patient survey was conducted to understand their thoughts on the change idea. Third, data were collected to assess the inefficiency problem on the number of times non-porter staff escorted patients due to porters being unavailable. A total of 14 PDSA (Plan-Do-Study-Act) cycles were completed between December 2018 and May 2019. A human factor specialist was consulted to examine the process for safety and optimisation of the patient journey. In our PDSA cycles, self-ambulatory patients were compared with ambulatory patients who required an escort. An improvement was found from time to X-ray of 28 min (11 min vs 39 min).

Participants were asked to express their level of agreement with the early-release of hypothetical prisoners. Results showed participants to be less favourable to the early-release of Black compared to White prisoners, when they had committed a stereotypically Black crime. As expected, the congruency between the crime stereotypicality and the colour of the prisoner’s skin did not emerge for White prisoners. Moreover, the difference between the agreement with the release of the Black vs. the White prisoner when both committed a stereotypically Black crime was higher as the level of endorsement of Meritocracy increased. Contrastingly, Anti-egalitarianism only predicted an overall disagreement with prisoners’ early-release.

Laboratory work with SARS-CoV-2 in a laboratory setting was rated to biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) biocontainment level. However, certain research applications in particular in molecular biology require incomplete denaturation of the proteins, which might cause safety issues handling contaminated samples. In this study, we evaluated lysis buffers that are commonly used in molecular biological laboratories for their ability to inactivate SARS-CoV-2. In addition, viral stability in cell culture media at 4 °C and on display glass and plastic surfaces used in laboratory environment was analyzed. Furthermore, we evaluated chemical and non-chemical inactivation methods including heat inactivation, UV-C light, addition of ethanol, acetone-methanol, and PFA, which might be used as a subsequent inactivation step in the case of insufficient inactivation. We infected susceptible Caco-2 and Vero cells with pre-treated SARS-CoV-2 and determined the tissue culture infection dose 50 (TCID(50)) using crystal violet staining and microscopy. In addition, lysates of infected cells and virus containing supernatant were subjected to RT-qPCR analysis. We have found that guanidine thiocyanate and most of the tested detergent containing lysis buffers were effective in inactivation of SARS-CoV-2, however, the M-PER lysis buffer containing a proprietary detergent failed to inactivate the virus. In conclusion, careful evaluation of the used inactivation methods is required especially for non-denaturing buffers. Additional inactivation steps might be necessary before removal of lysed viral samples from BSL-3.

We stress-test three liquidity ratios for each firm with full and partial operating flexibility in two simulated distress scenarios corresponding to drops in sales of 50% and 75%, respectively. In the most adverse scenario, the average firm with partial operating flexibility would exhaust its cash holdings in about two years. At that point, its current liabilities would increase, on average, by eight times, suggesting that the average firm would have to resort to the debt market to prevent a liquidity crunch. Moreover, about 1/10th of all sample firms would become illiquid within six months.

Genome sequencing of the strains obtained from Iberian hares with myxomatosis showed these to be distinct from the classical ones that circulated in rabbits since the virus introduction in Europe, in 1952. The main genomic difference in this natural recombinant hare myxoma virus (ha-MYXV) is the presence of an additional 2.8 kb region disrupting the M009L gene and adding a set of genes homologous to the myxoma virus (MYXV) genes M060R, M061R, M064R, M065R and M066R originated in Poxviruses. After the emergence of this recombinant virus (ha-MYXV) in hares, in the summer of 2019, the ha-MYXV was not detected in rabbit surveys, suggesting an apparent species segregation with the MYXV classic strains persistently circulating in rabbits. Recently, a group of six unvaccinated European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus cuniculus) from a backyard rabbitry in South Portugal developed signs of myxomatosis (anorexia, dyspnoea, oedema of eyelids, head, ears, external genitals and anus, and skin myxomas in the base of the ears). Five of them died within 24-48 hr of symptom onset. Molecular analysis revealed that only the recombinant MYXV was present. This is the first documented report of a recombinant hare myxoma virus in farm rabbits associated with high mortality, which increases the concern for the future of both the Iberian hare and wild rabbits and questions the safety of the rabbit industry. This highlights the urgent need to evaluate the efficacy of available vaccines against this new MYXV.","Abade Dos Santos, Fábio A; Carvalho, Carina L; Monteiro, Madalena; Carvalho, Paulo; Mendonça, Paula; Peleteiro, Maria da Conceição; Duarte, Margarida D",Transbound Emerg Dis,https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.13899; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33119958/,650
683804,Topology identifies emerging adaptive mutations in SARS-CoV-2,2021-06-13,"Chest X-ray is the first imaging technique that plays an important role in the diagnosis of COVID-19 disease. Due to the high availability of large-scale annotated image datasets, great success has been achieved using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition and classification. However, due to the limited availability of annotated medical images, the classification of medical images remains the biggest challenge in medical diagnosis. Thanks to transfer learning, an effective mechanism that can provide a promising solution by transferring knowledge from generic object recognition tasks to domain-specific tasks. In this paper, we validate and adapt our previously developed CNN, called Decompose, Transfer, and Compose (DeTraC), for the classification of COVID-19 chest X-ray images. DeTraC can deal with any irregularities in the image dataset by investigating its class boundaries using a class decomposition mechanism. The experimental results showed the capability of DeTraC in the detection of COVID-19 cases from a comprehensive image dataset collected from several hospitals around the world. High accuracy of 95.12% (with a sensitivity of 97.91%, a specificity of 91.87%, and a precision of 93.36%) was achieved by DeTraC in the detection of COVID-19 X-ray images from normal, and severe acute respiratory syndrome cases.","Abbas, Asmaa; Abdelsamea, Mohammed; Gaber, Mohamed",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.30.20047456,650

Here, we simulate the 3D structures and predict the B cell epitopes on the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins of SARS-CoV-2 using structure-based approaches and validate epitope immunogenicity by immunizing mice. Almost all 33 predicted epitopes effectively induce antibody production, six of these are immunodominant epitopes in individuals, and 23 are conserved within SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and bat coronavirus RaTG13. We find that the immunodominant epitopes of individuals with domestic (China) SARS-CoV-2 are different from those of individuals with imported (Europe) SARS-CoV-2, which may be caused by mutations on the S (G614D) and N proteins. Importantly, we find several epitopes on the S protein that elicit neutralizing antibodies against D614 and G614 SARS-CoV-2, which can contribute to vaccine design against coronaviruses.","Lu, Shuai; Xie, Xi-xiu; Zhao, Lei; Wang, Bin; Zhu, Jie; Yang, Ting-rui; Yang, Guang-wen; Ji, Mei; Lv, Cui-ping; Xue, Jian; Dai, Er-hei; Fu, Xi-ming; Liu, Dong-qun; Zhang, Lun; Hou, Sheng-jie; Yu, Xiao-lin; Wang, Yu-ling; Gao, Hui-xia; Shi, Xue-han; Ke, Chang-wen; Ke, Bi-xia; Jiang, Chun-guo; Liu, Rui-tian",Cell Rep,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211124720316557; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.108666; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124720316557; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33503420/,650

It is suggested that the new coronavirus spreads mostly via droplets, surface contact, and natural aerosols. Hence, high-risk aerosol-producing procedures, such as endotracheal intubation, may put the healthcare workers at a high risk of infection.

684877,"SARS-CoV-2 Entry Protein TMPRSS2 and Its Homologue, TMPRSS4 Adopts Structural Fold Similar to Blood Coagulation and Complement Pathway Related Proteins",2021-04-26,"BACKGROUND: Women who have undergone surgical treatment for epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) may develop menopausal symptoms due to immediate loss of ovarian function following surgery and chemotherapy. Women may experience vasomotor symptoms, sleep disturbance, difficulty concentrating, sexual dysfunction, vaginal symptoms and accelerated osteoporosis. Although hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is the most effective treatment to relieve these symptoms, its safety has been questioned for women with EOC. OBJECTIVES: To assess the safety and efficacy of HRT for menopausal symptoms in women surgically treated for EOC. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2019, Issue 6), MEDLINE via Ovid (1946 to 12 June 2019) and Embase via Ovid (1980 to 2019, week 23). We also handsearched conference reports and trial registries. There was no language restriction. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with participants of any age and menopausal status who had undergone surgery for EOC and, after diagnosis and treatment, used any regimen and duration of HRT compared with placebo or no hormone therapy. We also included trials comparing different regimens or duration of administration of HRT. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently identified studies that met the inclusion criteria. They used Covidence to extract study characteristics, outcome data and to assess methodological quality of the included studies. MAIN RESULTS: Our search strategy identified 2617 titles, of which 2614 titles were excluded. Three studies, involving 350 women, met our inclusion criteria. Two of the studies included pre and postmenopausal women, and the third only included premenopausal women. The overall age range of those women included in the studies was 20 to 89.6 years old, with a median follow-up ranging from 31.4 months to 19.1 years. The geographical distribution of participants included Europe, South Africa and China. All stages and histological subtypes were included in two of the studies, but stage IV disease had been excluded in the third. The three included studies used a variety of HRT regimens (conjugated oestrogen with or without medroxyprogesterone and with or without nylestriol) and HRT administrations (oral, patch and implant), In all studies, the comparisons were made versus women who had not received HRT. The studies were at low or unclear risk of selection and reporting bias, and at high risk of performance, detection and attrition bias. The certainty of the evidence was low for overall survival and progression-free survival, and very low for quality-of-life assessment, incidence of breast cancer, transient ischaemic attack (TIA), cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and myocardial infarction (MI). Meta-analysis of these studies showed that HRT may improve overall survival (hazard ratio (HR) 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54 to 0.93; 350 participants, 3 studies; low-certainty evidence). Quality-of-life assessment by use of the EORTC-C30 questionnaire was performed only in one study. We are uncertain whether HRT improves or reduces quality of life as the certainty of the evidence was assessed as very low (mean difference (MD) 13.67 points higher, 95% CI 9.26 higher to 18.08 higher; 1 study; 75 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Likewise, HRT may make little or no difference to progression-free survival (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.01; 275 participants, 2 studies; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether HRT improves or reduces the incidence of breast cancer (risk ratio (RR) 2.00, 95% CI 0.19 to 21.59; 225 participants, 2 studies; very low-certainty evidence); TIA (RR 5.00, 95% CI 0.24 to 102.42; 150 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence); CVA (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.11 to 3.88; 150 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence); and MI (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.10; 150 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). The incidence of gallstones was not reported in the included studies. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Hormone replacement therapy may slightly improve overall survival in women who have undergone surgical treatment for EOC, but the certainty of the evidence is low. HRT may make little or no difference to quality of life, incidence of breast cancer, TIA, CVA and MI as the certainty of the evidence has been assessed as very low. There may be little or no effect of HRT use on progression-free survival. The evidence in this review is limited by imprecision and incompleteness of reported relevant outcomes and therefore the results should be interpreted with caution. Future well-designed RCTs are required as this is an important area to women experiencing menopausal symptoms following surgical treatment for ovarian cancer, especially as doctors are often reluctant to prescribe HRT in this scenario. The evidence in this review is too limited to support or refute that HRT is very harmful in this population.","Saeaib, Nungrutai; Peeyananjarassri, Krantarat; Liabsuetrakul, Tippawan; Buhachat, Rakchai; Myriokefalitaki, Eva",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd012559.pub2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31989588/,650

HOCl is a fast-acting and potent antimicrobial agent that interacts with several biomolecules, such as sulfur-containing amino acids, lipids, nucleic acids, and membrane components, causing severe cellular damage. It is also produced by the immune system as a first-line of defense against invading pathogens. In this review, we summarize the adaptive responses of Gram-negative bacteria to HOCl-induced stress and highlight the role of chaperone holdases (Hsp33, RidA, Cnox, and polyP) as an immediate response to HOCl stress. We also describe the three identified transcriptional regulators (HypT, RclR, and NemR) that specifically respond to HOCl. Besides the activation of chaperones and transcriptional regulators, the formation of biofilms has been described as an important adaptive response to several stressors, including HOCl. Although the knowledge on the molecular mechanisms involved in HOCl biofilm stimulation is limited, studies have shown that HOCl induces the formation of biofilms by causing conformational changes in membrane properties, overproducing the extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) matrix, and increasing the intracellular concentration of cyclic-di-GMP. In addition, acquisition and expression of antibiotic resistance genes, secretion of virulence factors and induction of the viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state has also been described as an adaptive response to HOCl. In general, the knowledge of how bacteria respond to HOCl stress has increased over time; however, the molecular mechanisms involved in this stress response is still in its infancy. A better understanding of these mechanisms could help understand host-pathogen interactions and target specific genes and molecules to control bacterial spread and colonization.","da Cruz Nizer, Waleska Stephanie; Inkovskiy, Vasily; Overhage, Joerg",Microorganisms,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32796669/; https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms8081220,650

Nevertheless, this strategy has other undesirable effects such as physical inactivity and psychological distress, which are associated with cognitive impairment. We aimed to examine whether physical activity during social distancing restrictions could reduce the risk of subjective memory decline in adults. Participants (n=2321) completed the baseline assessment of PAMPA cohort (Prospective Study About Mental and Physical Health), a ambispective cohort study conducted in southern Brazil. An online-based, self-administered questionnaire assessed physical activity and self-rated memory in two different periods: before and during social distancing. Data collection was executed from June 22nd to July 23rd 2020. Adjusted Poisson regression models were performed and values reported in prevalence ratio (PR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Participants presented with a mean age of 38.2 (95%CI: 37.5, 38.9) years. Most were women (76.6%), had at least a university degree (66.7%), and were overweight or obese (53.3%). Subjective memory decline was reported by 30.0% (95%CI: 27.7%, 32.4%) of respondents. Most individuals with subjective memory decline reported being physically inactive during the pandemic of COVID-19. Participants were less likely to experience subjective memory decline if they either became (PR: 0.56; 95%CI: 0.36, 0.89) or remained (PR: 0.68; 95%CI: 0.49, 0.93) physically active compared to inactive respondents. Physical activity participation during social distancing reduced the likelihood of subjective memory decline in adults.

Diverse restoration techniques could reverse the process of habitat impoverishment. However, in most of the restoration efforts, only vegetation cover is targeted. Fauna and flora are treated as isolated components, neglecting a key component of ecosystems’ functioning, the ecological interactions. We tested whether the resilient frugivorous generalist fauna can improve habitat quality by dispersing native plant species through the use of fruit feeders as in a semideciduous seasonal urban forest fragment. A total of 32 sampling points was selected at a heavily degraded 251-ha urban forest fragment, with feeders installed at two heights monitored by camera-traps. Variable quantities of native fruits of 27 zoochorous species were offered alternately in the feeders. Based on more than 36,000 h of video records, Turdus leucomelas (Class Aves), Sapajus nigritus (Class Mammalia), and Salvator merianae (Class Reptilia) were recorded ingesting the highest fruit species richness.

Biotechnological research on Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) provides a range of opportunities (such as increased crop yields, resistance to pests and diseases, enhanced nutrient composition and food quality) in addressing the hunger, malnutrition and food security issues on the continent. However, the acceptance and adoption of GMOs on the continent has been remarkably slow, perhaps due to contrasting views about the benefits and safety concerns associated with them. With the reality of food insecurity and the booming population in Africa, there is an eminent need for a more pragmatic position to this debate. The present review presents an overview of the current situation of food safety and security and attempts to reconcile major viewpoints on GMOs research considering the current food safety and security crisis in the African continent.","Gbashi, Sefater; Adebo, Oluwafemi; Adebiyi, Janet Adeyinka; Targuma, Sarem; Tebele, Shandry; Areo, Oluwaseun Mary; Olopade, Bunmi; Odukoya, Julianah Olayemi; Njobeh, Patrick",Biotechnology & genetic engineering reviews,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34309495/; https://doi.org/10.1080/02648725.2021.1940735,650
687885,SUBCELLULAR LOCALIZATION OF SARS-CoV STRUCTURAL PROTEINS,2006-01-01,"COVID-19 morbidity and mortality are increased in patients with diabetes and kidney disease via unknown mechanisms. SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for entry into host cells. Since ACE2 is a susceptibility factor for infection, we investigated how diabetic kidney disease and medications alter ACE2 receptor expression in kidneys. Single cell RNA profiling of healthy living donor and kidney biopsies from patients with diabetic kidney disease revealed ACE2 expression primarily in proximal tubular epithelial cells. This cell specific localization was confirmed by in situ hybridization. ACE2 expression levels were unaltered by exposures to renin angiotensin aldosterone system inhibitors in diabetic kidney disease. Bayesian integrative analysis of a large compendium of public-omics datasets identified molecular network modules induced in ACE2-expressing proximal tubular epithelial cells in diabetic kidney disease (searchable at hb.flatironinstitute.org/covid-kidney) that were linked to viral entry, immune activation, endomembrane reorganization, and RNA processing. The diabetic kidney disease ACE2-positive proximal tubular epithelial cell module overlapped with expression patterns seen in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. Similar cellular programs were seen in ACE2-positive proximal tubular epithelial cells obtained from urine samples of 13hospitalized patients with COVID-19, suggesting a consistent ACE2-coregulated proximal tubular epithelial cell expression program that may interact with the SARS-CoV-2 infection processes. Thus SARS-CoV-2 receptor networks can seed further research into risk stratification and therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 related kidney damage.","Menon, Rajasree; Otto, Edgar A.; Sealfon, Rachel; Nair, Viji; Wong, Aaron K.; Theesfeld, Chandra L.; Chen, Xi; Wang, Yuan; Boppana, Avinash S.; Luo, Jinghui; Yang, Yingbao; Kasson, Peter M.; Schaub, Jennifer A.; Berthier, Celine C.; Eddy, Sean; Lienczewski, Chrysta C.; Godfrey, Bradley; Dagenais, Susan L.; Sohaney, Ryann; Hartman, John; Fermin, Damian; Subramanian, Lalita; Looker, Helen C.; Harder, Jennifer L.; Mariani, Laura H.; Hodgin, Jeffrey B.; Sexton, Jonathan Z.; Wobus, Christiane E.; Naik, Abhijit S.; Nelson, Robert G.; Troyanskaya, Olga G.; Kretzler, Matthias",Kidney Int,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0085253820311133; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0085253820311133?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.kint.2020.09.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33038424/,650

His basic lab workup was concerning for a coagulopathy with an elevated activated partial thromboplastin time and significant anaemia. Mixing studies and other factor levels were tested that led to the diagnosis of acquired haemophilia A with low factor VIII levels and high factor VIII antibodies. He was started on steroids, but his haemoglobin level continued to drop. Later, during his treatment, he was given multiple therapeutic agents, including cyclophosphamide, rituximab and recombinant factor VII (NovoSeven-R). Gradually factor VIII levels increased and haemoglobin stabilised. The hospital course was complicated by COVID-19 pneumonia leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome; the patient eventually expired due to respiratory failure.","Shah, Ejaz; Abro, Calvin; Zaidi, Fawwad; Goel, Ruchika",BMJ case reports,https://doi.org/10.1136/bcr-2021-244748; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34598965/,650

We contend that COVID‐19 is “the great accelerator” in fast-tracking the existing global trend towards embracing modern emerging technologies ushering in transformations in lifestyle, work patterns, and business strategies. Thus, COVID-19 has evolved to be a kind of “catalyst” for the adoption and increasing use of digitalization in work organization and the office, alongside presenting foreseen and unforeseen opportunities, challenges, and costs—leading to negative and positive feedback loops. In this article, we develop and advance a conceptual model by linking the different forces for and against digitalization in response to the pandemic. Our analysis indicates that adoption of emerging technologies may be hindered by vested external interests, nostalgia, and employer opportunism, as well as negative effects on employee well-being that undermine productivity, work–life balance, and future of work. Whilst digitalization may bring new opportunities, the process imparts risks that may be hard to mitigate or prepare for. Finally, we draw out the wider theoretical and practical implications of our analysis.","Amankwah-Amoah, Joseph; Khan, Zaheer; Wood, Geoffrey; Knight, Gary",J Bus Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0148296321005725; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34538980/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0148296321005725; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbusres.2021.08.011,650

Practicability was defined as the correct use of the self-test and the correct interpretation of the result. The correct use of self-test was conditioned by the presence of the control band after 15-min of migration. The correct interpretation of the tests was defined by the percent agreement between the tests results read and interpret by the participants compared to the expected results coded by the numbers and verified by trained observers. A total of 167 participants (52.7% female; median age, 35.8 years; 82% with post-graduate level) were enrolled, including 83 and 84 for usability and test results interpretation substudies, respectively. All participants (100%; 95% CI: 95.6–100) correctly used the self-test. However, 12 (14.5%; 95% CI: 8.5–23.6) asked for verbal help. The percent agreement between the tests results read and interpret by the participants compared to the expected results was 98.5% (95% CI: 96.5–99.4). However, misinterpretation occurred in only 2.3% of positive and 1.2% of invalid test results. Finally, all (100%) participants found that performing the COVID-19 self-test was easy; and 98.8% found the interpretation of the self-test results easy. Taken together, these pilot observations demonstrated for the first-time, high practicability and satisfaction of COVID-19 self-testing for serological IgG and IgM immune status, indicating its potential for use by the general public to complete the arsenal of available SARS-CoV-2 serological assays in the urgent context of the COVID-19 epidemic.","Tonen-Wolyec, Serge; Dupont, Raphael; Batina-Agasa, Salomon; Hayette, Marie-Pierre; Bélec, Laurent",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0240779; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33057446/,650

However, leisure is not impervious to cooptation by less benevolent social processes. In this conceptual analysis, I argue that incarcerated women's leisure must be rethought as a component of its environment and by extension, as subjected to coercive and normative prison missions. After broadly delineating incarcerated women's leisure, I determine that some characteristics of leisure can be compatible with these prison missions. I then examine individual, organizational, and social benefits and issues with leisure in women's prisons. I link these practices to reduced coerciveness and increased normativity. I conclude by suggesting that ensuring incarcerated people's well-being through leisure is not in itself an end, but a means to achieve prison's coercive and normative ends. I discuss implications for scholars, practitioners, and advocates.","Marcoux Rouleau, Alexis",Front Sports Act Living,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33345159/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fspor.2020.588775,650

Yet, antibiotics are routinely used as a treatment to an unknown extent. It was our goal to survey antibiotic use for the treatment of neonatal calf diarrhea in different countries and to identify influencing factors. A total of 873 farmers and veterinarians in Austria, Belgium, Portugal, and Scotland participated in a voluntary online survey. The data were analyzed using classification and regression tree analyses and chi(2) tests. Overall, 52.5% of the participants stated that they use antibiotics when treating neonatal calf diarrhea. Of those, 27% use them always, and 45% use highest priority critically important antibiotics. The most important factor differentiating antibiotic use practices was the country the participants were from, which could be due to regulatory differences between the countries. All antibiotic products stated were licensed for use in cattle, but several were not licensed for the treatment of diarrhea in calves. Our study shows that there is an urgent need for more scientific evidence to define best practices for the treatment of neonatal calf diarrhea. Furthermore, consensual criteria for antibiotic therapy must be defined, and targeted training for farmers and veterinarians must be provided.","Eibl, Cassandra; Bexiga, Ricardo; Viora, Lorenzo; Guyot, Hugues; Félix, José; Wilms, Johanna; Tichy, Alexander; Hund, Alexandra",Antibiotics (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34438960/; https://doi.org/10.3390/antibiotics10080910,650

In diabetic use, the DPP-4 inhibitor can block the DDP-4 to attenuate GLP-1 degradation and prolong GLP-1 its action and sensitize insulin activity for the purpose of lowering blood glucose. Nonetheless the adverse effects of DPP-4 inhibitors severely hinder their clinical applications, and notably there is a clinical demand for novel DPP-4 inhibitors from various sources including chemical synthesis, herbs, and plants with fewer side effects. In this review, we highlight various strategies, namely computational biology (in silico), in vitro enzymatic and cell assays, and in vivo animal tests, for seeking natural DPP-4 inhibitors from botanic sources including herbs and plants. The pros and cons of all approaches for new inhibitor candidates or hits will be under discussion.","Lin, Shian-Ren; Chang, Chia-Hsiang; Tsai, May-Jwan; Cheng, Henrich; Chen, Jian-Chyi; Leong, Max K.; Weng, Ching-Feng",Ther Adv Chronic Dis,https://doi.org/10.1177/2040622319875305; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31555430/,650
