METHODS: The SAC (3 pediatric rheumatologists and 2 pediatric infectious disease specialists) elaborated and approved by consensus a provisional list of OI for use in JIA. Through a 5 step-procedure, all the severe and serious infections, classified as per MedDRA dictionary and retrieved in the Pharmachild registry, were evaluated by the SAC by answering six questions and adjudicated with the agreement of 3/5 specialists. A final evidence-based list of OI resulted by matching the adjudicated infections with the provisional list of OI. RESULTS: A total of 772 infectious events in 572 eligible patients, of which 335 serious/severe/very severe non-OI and 437 OI (any intensity/severity), according to the provisional list, were retrieved. Six hundred eighty-two of 772 (88.3%) were adjudicated as infections, of them 603/682 (88.4%) as common and 119/682 (17.4%) as OI by the SAC. Matching these 119 opportunistic events with the provisional list, 106 were confirmed by the SAC as OI, and among them infections by herpes viruses were the most frequent (68%), followed by tuberculosis (27.4%). The remaining events were divided in the groups of non-OI and possible/patient and/or pathogen-related OI. CONCLUSIONS: We found a significant number of OI in JIA patients on immunosuppressive therapy. The proposed list of OI, created by consensus and validated in the Pharmachild cohort, could facilitate comparison among future pharmacovigilance studies.

The aim of this study was to investigate the association of vasoactive-inotropic score with tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion and tricuspid regurgitation in off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting, and to calculate the optimal cut-off value of tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion to predict emergency conversion to cardiopulmonary bypass. METHODS: Patients over 20 years of age who had undergone off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting between April 2015 and March 2020 were enrolled in this study. We retrospectively assessed the association of intraoperative maximum “vasoactive-inotropic score”, a weighted sum of various inotropes and vasoconstrictors, with tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion and tricuspid regurgitation. A receiver operating characteristic curve of conversion on tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion was also constructed. RESULTS: 135 patients were included in final analysis. Conversion was performed in 10 cases. Multiple regression analysis showed that tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion, mild or more tricuspid regurgitation and experienced surgeon were significantly related to vasoactive-inotropic score. The receiver operating characteristic curve to predict conversion by tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion showed an optimal cut-off value of 15.0 mm and area under the curve of 0.808. CONCLUSIONS: Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion and tricuspid regurgitation were associated with vasoactive-inotropic score in off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting. The optimal cut-off value of tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion to predict emergency conversion was 15 mm.","Kunigo, Tatsuya; Yoshikawa, Yusuke; Yamamoto, Shuji; Yamakage, Michiaki",Gen Thorac Cardiovasc Surg,76,17

Conflict, natural disasters, and epidemics may increase gender inequities, but also present an opportunity to address them. This scoping review describes and identifies gaps in the measurement tools, methods, and indicators used to measure GEWE in humanitarian settings, and presents a dashboard that can be used by researchers, organizations and governments to identify GEWE measurement tools. METHODS: Scientific articles published between January 2004 and November 2019 were identified using Embase, Medline, PsycInfo, CINAHL, Scopus, and PAIS index. Relevant non peer-reviewed literature was downloaded from the websites of humanitarian organizations. Publications on women and/or girls impacted by a humanitarian crisis in a LMIC, within 5 years of data collection, were included. Publications were double-screened in the title/abstract and full-text stages. We used a machine learning software during the title/abstract screening to increase the efficiency of the process. Measurement tools, sampling and data collection methods, gap areas (geographical, topical and contextual), and indicators were catalogued for easy access in an interactive Tableau dashboard. RESULTS: Our search yielded 27,197 publications and 2396 non peer-reviewed literature reports. One hundred and seventy publications were included in the final review. Extracted indicators were categorized into seven domains: economic, health, human development, leadership, psychological, security and justice, and sociocultural. The vast majority of studies were observational, and over 70% utilized a cross-sectional study design. Thirty-eight toolkits and questionnaires were identified in this review, of which 19 (50%) were designed specifically for humanitarian settings. Sociocultural was the largest domain in number of studies and indicators in this review, with gender-based violence indicators reported in 66% of studies. Indicators of economic, human development and leadership were uncommon in the peer-reviewed literature. DISCUSSION: While there has been some effort to measure GEWE in conflict-affected and other humanitarian settings, measurement has largely focused on violence and security issues. A more comprehensive framework for measuring GEWE in these settings is needed; objective measurement of women’s empowerment and gender equality should be prioritized by organizations providing humanitarian aid.

The Canadian Armed Forces aims to ensure that SMs and their families are resilient and SMs ready to respond when called upon for combat, peacekeeping or pandemic/disaster-response. Family concerns, however, can realistically distract SMs from the mission, potentially compromising themselves, their unit and the mission. Resilience-training programs such as Bounce Back and Thrive! (BBT) can help families manage the realities of military life. OBJECTIVE: This pilot study aimed to evaluate suitability of BBT implementation by Military Family Resource Centers (MFRCs), including whether BBT: (1) fosters resilience-building among parents, (2) facilitates CMF resilience-building, (3) can be contextualized for CMFs, and (4) supports MFRCs in cultivating a culture of resilience. METHODS: An exploratory qualitative design was used. BBT was offered to parents face-to-face. Participants completed focus groups after the first 6 sessions, final 4 sessions, and one-year post-intervention. Data was thematically analyzed. RESULTS: Nine military parents participated. Four major themes resulted: (1) military parent resilience-building, (2) CMF resilience-building, (3) BBT program feedback and contextualization, and (4) MFRCs as community resilience hubs. DISCUSSION: BBT enabled parents to gain a new perspective on resilience, engage in dialogue and intentionally role model resilience skills. Military-specific BBT contextualization and online-delivery formats would increase suitability and access for CMFs. Access to resilience programs delivered through MFRCs would support CMFs. Further research is warranted.","Mikolas, Cynthia; Pike, Ashley; Jones, Chelsea; Smith-MacDonald, Lorraine; Lee, Melina; Winfield, Hope; Griffiths, Jennifer; Perry, Ryan; Olson, David M.; Heber, Alexandra; Olson, Joanne; Sevigny, Phillip R.; Brémault-Philips, Suzette",Front Psychol,76,22

The challenge is that as they move, their properties change due to evaporation, the Wells (Am. J. Hyg. 20:611–618, 1934) droplet-nuclei hypothesis. In this paper we examine the effect of evaporation on their movement within a homogeneous turbulent environment. The effect of turbulence is to significantly increase the transmission distance and spread. These numerical results demonstrate that by reducing the level of turbulence, the potential for spreading diseases is reduced. This is in accordance with available experimental/in situ measurements.","Klettner, C. A.; Eames, I.; Tang, J.

Practically, this leads to several important questions. For example, which test or which subset of tests should be selected, taking into account the effectiveness of individual tests, synergies and redundancies between them, as well as their cost. How to produce an optimal decision rule on the basis of the data given, which typically consists of test results for patients with or without confirmed health condition. To address questions of this kind, we develop an approach that combines (semi-supervised) machine learning methodology with concepts from (cooperative) game theory. Roughly speaking, while the former is responsible for optimally combining single tests into decision rules, the latter is used to judge the influence and importance of individual tests as well as the interaction between them. Our approach is motivated and illustrated by a concrete case study in veterinary medicine, namely the diagnosis of a disease in cats called feline infectious peritonitis.","Pfannschmidt, Karlson; Hüllermeier, Eyke; Held, Susanne; Neiger, Reto",Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems,76,5

After the emergence of AIDS, Social Network Analysis (SNA) was demonstrated to be a good supplementary tool for contact tracing. Traditionally, social networks for disease investigations are constructed only with personal contacts. However, for diseases which transmit not only through personal contacts, incorporating geographical contacts into SNA has been demonstrated to reveal potential contacts among patients. In this research, we use Taiwan SARS data to investigate the differences in connectivity between personal and geographical contacts in the construction of social networks for these diseases. According to our results, geographical contacts, which increase the average degree of nodes from 0 to 108.62 and decrease the number of components from 961 to 82, provide much higher connectivity than personal contacts. Therefore, including geographical contacts is important to understand the underlying context of the transmission of these diseases. We further explore the differences in network topology between one-mode networks with only patients and multi-mode networks with patients and geographical locations for disease investigation. We find that including geographical locations as nodes in a social network provides a good way to see the role that those locations play in the disease transmission and reveal potential bridges among those geographical locations and households.","Chen, Yi-Da; Tseng, Chunju; King, Chwan-Chuen; Wu, Tsung-Shu Joseph; Chen, Hsinchun",Intelligence and Security Informatics: Biosurveillance,76,5

As the fourth leading cause of death in the United States and Europe, COPD results in a substantial and ever increasing economic and social burden [1]. Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) are frequently encountered in the intensive care unit (ICU). Although there is no standardized definition, AECOPD are characterized by a significant change in patient symptoms from baseline accompanied by overall increased airway resistance [2]. These exacerbations carry a significant risk to patients, with 10 % in-hospital mortality and 1-year and 2-year all-cause mortality rates of 43 % and 49 %, respectively, in patients with hypercapnic exacerbations [3]. Other studies note in-hospital mortality rates as high as 30 % with worse outcomes associated with older age, severity of respiratory and non-respiratory organ dysfunction, and hospital length of stay [4]. Given that patients transferred to the ICU with AECOPD are at high risk for complications and adverse outcomes, early diagnosis and management are critical to improve patient outcomes and survival in this population.","Kassutto, Stacey M.; Kayser, Joshua B.",Principles of Adult Surgical Critical Care,76,5

In the last few decades, increasing concerns about unfavorable outcomes associated with ABT, anticipation of future insufficient blood supply, and awareness of the cost (direct and indirect) of transfusion have led to the promotion of patient blood management (PBM) as a cost-effective strategy, beneficial for patients as well as for society (Shander et al. 2010). PBM programs utilize a series of measures with a proven ability to reduce ABT and to be cost-effective. Despite that the impact of PBM on patient clinical outcomes needs to be fully defined and future studies are needed, PBM should be adopted as a new standard of care.","Gentilini, Grazia; Ringressi, Alvaro",Perioperative Medical Management for Total Joint Arthroplasty,76,5

We argue that there are at least two reasons making inspectability challenging: (i) representations are distributed across hundreds of channels and (ii) a unifying metric quantifying inspectability is lacking. In this paper, we address both issues by proposing Semantic Bottlenecks (SB), integrated into pretrained networks, to align channel outputs with individual visual concepts and introduce the model agnostic AUiC metric to measure the alignment. We present a case study on semantic segmentation to demonstrate that SBs improve the AUiC up to four-fold over regular network outputs. We explore two types of SB-layers in this work: while concept-supervised SB-layers (SSB) offer the greatest inspectability, we show that the second type, unsupervised SBs (USB), can match the SSBs by producing one-hot encodings. Importantly, for both SB types, we can recover state of the art segmentation performance despite a drastic dimensionality reduction from 1000s of non aligned channels to 10s of semantics-aligned channels that all downstream results are based on.

It provides a large part of high-quality protein food for humans, and thus, a sustainable aquaculture industry is of great importance for the worldwide food supply and economy. Along with the quick expansion of aquaculture, the high fish densities employed in fish farming increase the risks of outbreaks of a variety of aquatic diseases. Such diseases not only cause huge economic losses, but also lead to ecological hazards in terms of pathogen spread to marine ecosystems causing infection of wild fish and polluting the environment. Thus, fish health is essential for the aquaculture industry to be environmentally sustainable and a prerequisite for intensive aquaculture production globally. The wide use of antibiotics and drug residues has caused intensive pollution along with risks for food safety and increasing antimicrobial resistance. Vaccination is the most effective and environmentally friendly approach to battle infectious diseases in aquaculture with minimal ecological impact and is applicable to most species of farmed fish. However, there are only 34 fish vaccines commercially available globally to date, showing the urgent need for further development of fish vaccines to manage fish health and ensure food safety. Plant genetic engineering has been utilized to produce genetically modified crops with desirable characteristics and has also been used for vaccine production, with several advantages including cost-effectiveness, safety when compared with live virus vaccines, and plants being capable of carrying out posttranslational modifications that are similar to naturally occurring systems. So far, plant-derived vaccines, antibodies, and therapeutic proteins have been produced for human and animal health. However, the development of plant-made vaccines for animals, especially fish, is still lagging behind the development of human vaccines. The present review summarizes the development of fish vaccines currently utilized and the suitability of the plant-production platform for fish vaccine and then addresses considerations regarding fish vaccine production in plants. Developing fish vaccines by way of plant biotechnology are significant for the aquaculture industry, fish health management, food safety, and human health.","Su, Hang; Yakovlev, Igor A.; van Eerde, André; Su, Jianguo; Clarke, Jihong Liu",Front Plant Sci,76,1

As ophthalmological manifestations of COVID-19 in newborns are still unknown, it is important to clarify if SARS-CoV-2 could be associated with ocular abnormalities. Objective To determine whether exposure to SARS-CoV-2 is associated with outcomes in the eyes of newborns. Design, Setting, and Participants This case series enrolled newborns from April to November 2020 from 3 different maternity hospitals in São Paulo, Brazil. The diagnosis of COVID-19 in mothers and newborns was based on real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assays with material obtained from oronasopharyngeal swab sample; positive IGM serology was also considered as a diagnostic test for mothers. Newborns were excluded if they had any evidence of another congenital infection. All infants underwent external ocular examination and binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy. Exposures Serology test for COVID-19 and detection of SARS-CoV-2 from oronasopharyngeal specimen using a real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay on both mothers and newborns. Main Outcomes and Measures Screening for ophthalmologic manifestation in newborns after maternal COVID-19 infection. Results A total of 165 newborns (age range at examination, 1 to 18 days) were evaluated. Of these, 123 (74.5%) were born at full term, and 42 (25.4%) were born preterm. Maternal gestational age at the time of COVID-19-positive test varied from first to 40th gestational weeks. Six newborns (3.6%) had positive polymerase chain reaction findings for SARS-CoV-2. One newborn tested positive within 18 days (horizontal transmission), and 5 newborns tested positive in the first day of life (possible vertical transmission). None had ocular abnormalities. Concerning exposed newborns with negative test results, 1 presented with venous engorgement and vascular tortuosity, 7 had intraretinal hemorrhages, and 2 were diagnosed as having retinopathy of prematurity. Conclusions and Relevance In this uncontrolled case series of Brazilian newborns of mothers with COVID-19 infection, a low rate of COVID-19 infection was found among newborns, and none had ocular abnormalities. Additional controlled studies may be warranted to confirm these findings.","Kiappe, Olívia Pereira; Santos da Cruz, Natasha Ferreira; Rosa, Paulo Alberto Cervi; Arrais, Luciana; Bueno de Moraes, Nilva Simeren",JAMA ophthalmology,76,1

Thus, the present study aimed to identification novel regulation factors of IFITM genes. Our data showed up-regulation of IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 genes in A549 by H5N1 virus infection. However, IFITM1 was not affected, IFITM2 and IFITM3 increases expression following different concentration H5N1 virus infection in HEK293T cells. This is the first time to find differences of IFITM1 transcription in different cells with the H5N1 virus infection. Moreover, experiments showed that H5N1 virus promotes expression of KLF4 and KLF5 in both A549 and HEK293T cells, but H5N1 virus NS1, M1, NP or PB2 alone has no obvious effect on transcription of KLF5. Overexpression of KLF5 increases transcription of IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 in A549 cells, however, it does not affect transcription of IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 in HEK293T cells. In addition, results for the first time displayed that KLF4 can up-regulate expression of IFITM5 in both A549 and HEK293T cells.

OBJECTIVES To verify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the blood donor's attendance and production of blood components in Fundação Hemominas, a Brazilian public institution was formed by several Blood Centres. METHODS A cross-sectional study was carried out from January to June 2020. Data collected were compared to a historical series from 2016 to 2019. RESULTS The study showed a reduction in the attendance of blood donors, whole blood collections and blood component production from March 2020, when the first case of COVID-19 was notified in Minas Gerais, Brazil. The results evidenced that Hemominas Blood Centres were affected in a very distinct way by the pandemic with a general mean reduction around 17% in attendance of blood donors and in production of blood components in the period of March to June. On the other hand, the return of blood donors rate increased. CONCLUSION The reduction in blood donation during the pandemic period was significant, despite the measures adopted. Still, the recruitment of return donors appears to be an important measure to be considered to decrease the pandemic's effect on blood stocks.","Silva-Malta, Maria Clara Fernandes; Rodrigues, Daniela de Oliveira Werneck; Chaves, Daniel Gonçalves; Magalhães, Nathalia Noyma Sampaio; Ribeiro, Maísa Aparecida; Cioffi, Junia Guimarães Mourão; Martins, Marina Lobato",Transfusion medicine,76,1

Management of PJI is dependent upon accurate diagnosis and successful treatment, both of which are challenging. Recently, great strides have been made in improving the diagnosis of PJI, which has no 'gold standard' diagnostic tool. Proper diagnosis is essential as untreated or undetected PJI can quickly lead to biofilm formation on the implant surface depending upon the infecting organism. Upon complete biofilm formation, successful treatment requires prosthetic resection with immediate or delayed reimplantation. Even with the most aggressive surgical treatment, PJI eradication currently has a success rate of approximately 80%.

Consequences of the financial downturn on health outcomes have begun to emerge. This recession has led to an increase in poor health status, raising rates of anxiety and depression among the economically vulnerable. In addition, the incidence of some communicable diseases along with the rate of suicide has increased significantly. The recession has also driven structural reforms, and affected the priority given to public policies. The purpose of this paper is to analyse how austerity impacts health in Europe and better understand the response of European health systems to the financial crisis. The current economic climate, while challenging, presents an opportunity for reforming and restructuring health promotion actions. More innovative approaches to health should be developed by health professionals and by those responsible for health management. In addition, scientists and experts in public health should promote evidence-based approaches to economic and public health recovery by analyzing the present economic downturn and previous crisis. However, it is governance and leadership that will mostly determine how well health systems are prepared to face the crisis and find ways to mitigate its effects.","Quaglio, Gianluca; Karapiperis, Theodoros; Van Woensel, Lieve; Arnold, Elleke; McDaid, David",Health policy,76,1

Early results of endovascular therapy for IAs have clearly underscored large aneurysm size, low coil packing density and wide aneurysm neck as factors limiting successful long term obliteration. Intracranial stents were originally introduced as adjuncts to mitigate these limitations by facilitating tighter coil packing and preventing coil herniation. As evidence of their utility as flow diversion devices and as catalysts for aneurysm neck remodeling surfaced, their potential as standalone therapy was realised and is currently under close scrutiny. Here we review the evolution of stents in the treatment of IAs, from balloon expandable stents, to self-expanding stents, to the exciting advances in monotherapeutic flow diverting stents, amalgamating occlusion rates and reviewing complication rates.","Gross, Bradley A; Frerichs, Kai U","Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",76,1

However, recent studies have shown lower patency without a wound complication benefit. We sought to further define the wound complication and patency rates of endoscopic harvest compared with open harvest in infrainguinal arterial bypass procedures. METHODS Infrainguinal bypasses performed from 2000 to 2011 were analyzed. Only procedures using a single segment of great saphenous vein were included. Cases were grouped according to endoscopic or open harvest and were frequency-matched for body mass index and diabetes. Baseline characteristics were compared. Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed to determine correlation of baseline data and harvest method on wound complications and patency. RESULTS The study included 76 bypasses; 35 in the endoscopic harvest group and 41 in the open harvest group. Baseline characteristics between the endoscopic and open harvest groups were not significantly different, with the exception of mean age, which was older in the endoscopic harvest group, and carotid artery disease, which was more common in the open harvest group. There was no significant difference between endoscopic and open harvest in 30-day wound complication rates (29% vs 27%; P = .87) or in the other perioperative variables, aside from decreased narcotic use in the endoscopic harvest group (P = .01). Mean follow-up was 747 days. There was no significant difference in 3-year primary (47% vs 49%; P = .8), 3-year primary-assisted (88% vs 73%; P = .1), or secondary patency rates (92% vs 76%; P = .09) at 3 years between the endoscopic and open harvest groups. High body mass index improved primary patency in the endoscopic harvest group (P = .02), but had no effect on patency in the open harvest group (P = .15). Patients requiring hemodialysis had increased risk for loss of primary assisted patency in both groups (endoscopic, P = .02; open, P = .02) and decreased secondary patency in the open harvest group (P = .04). CONCLUSIONS Endoscopic and open harvest techniques for infrainguinal arterial bypass provide similar rates of wound complications and bypass patency, whereas hemodialysis negatively affects patency after both harvest methods. Endoscopic harvest is associated with the need for less perioperative narcotics, suggesting a potential benefit of endoscopic harvest that deserves further study.","Wartman, Sarah M; Woo, Karen; Herscu, Gabriel; Morell, Michael; Nikolian, Vahagn; Manzur, Miguel; Weaver, Fred A",Journal of vascular surgery,76,25

RECENT FINDINGS The ability to visualize the small bowel was revolutionized with the introduction of VCE technology. VCE allows for accurate, noninvasive visualization of the small bowel mucosa. This device is invaluable in the investigation of obscure gastrointestinal bleeding (OGIB), occult bleeding with iron deficiency anaemia, small bowel Crohn's disease (CD), small bowel neoplasms and other mucosal disorders. Recent studies underscored the utility of VCE for documenting the extent and severity of small bowel CD as well as monitoring activity after therapy. The accuracy of the discrimination between small bowel tumours and benign bulges has been improved by a novel endoscopic algorithm. The accuracy of VCE was also evaluated as a potential noninvasive alternative to small bowel biopsies in suspected celiac disease. New findings have been made using breath tests and other biomarkers for the diagnosis of celiac disease, irritable bowel syndrome and bacterial overgrowth.

Knowledge of the cerebral hemodynamic response to painful stimuli contributes to understanding of cortical pain processing and the neurovascular network in the preterm brain. Previous research has demonstrated cerebral hemodynamic responses using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) after noxious stimuli in infants appropriately grown for age (AGA). But this has not been studied in infants born small for gestational age after fetal growth restriction (FGR). FGR infants differ in brain development due to utero-placental insufficiency leading to the intrauterine growth restriction, and cerebral response to pain may be altered. Objectives: We aimed to compare the cerebral hemodynamic response to painful stimuli (heel lance) in FGR and AGA infants. Methods: Preterm FGR infants (n = 20) and AGA infants (n = 15) born at 28-32 weeks' gestation were studied at mean ± SD postnatal age of 11.5 ± 2.4 and 10.5 ± 2.4 days, respectively. Infants had baseline echocardiographic assessment of ductus arteriosus and stroke volume. They were monitored with NIRS for changes in tissue oxygenation index (TOI, %), and oxygenated, deoxygenated, and total hemoglobin (ΔO2Hb, ΔHHb, and ΔTHb) in contralateral and ipsilateral cerebral hemispheres, during a heel lance. Results: At baseline, FGR infants had significantly lower TOI, higher heart rate, and lower stroke volume compared to AGA infants. Most infants in both groups showed increase in each of the NIRS parameters in the contralateral hemisphere following heel lance. However, more AGA infants (6/15) showed decreased ΔTHb compared to FGR infants (1/20) (p = 0.016). The magnitude of cerebral hemodynamic response and time to response did not differ between FGR and AGA infants. FGR infants showed larger ΔO2Hb in the contralateral compared to ipsilateral cortex (p = 0.05). Conclusion: Preterm FGR infants have reduced stroke volume and lower cerebral oxygenation compared to AGA infants in the second to third week of life. FGR infants show similar cerebral hemodynamic responses to noxious stimuli compared to AGA infants. However, FGR infants are less likely to have a cerebral vasoconstrictive response, possibly due to cerebrovascular changes following placental insufficiency and brain sparing in-utero.","Dix, Laura M L; Shepherd, Kelsee; Polglase, Graeme R; Miller, Suzanne L; Sehgal, Arvind; Wong, Flora Y",Frontiers in pediatrics,76,1

Sixty patients (83 procedures) were included in the study. Fifty-seven patients (95.0 %) underwent previous craniotomy, craniectomy, or other trans-galeal procedure. Of the total 60 patients, 35 patients received preoperative radiation. Sixteen patients received bevacizumab prior to their index case, while 12 received bevacizumab postoperatively. Ten patients (16.7 %) required additional plastic surgical intervention for wound complications after their index plastic surgery procedure.

None of the 14 patients who underwent prophylactic plastic surgery closure for previous scalp incision, preoperative bevacizumab, and XRT administration required re-intervention. Plastic surgery closure of complex scalp incisions reduces the incidence of wound complications among patients who underwent previous neurosurgical intervention, XRT administration, and preoperative bevacizumab administration. This is particularly true when plastic surgery closure is performed ""prophylactically."" Further collaboration between the neurosurgical and plastic surgery teams is therefore warranted, particularly in the setting of these high-risk cases.","Golas, Alyssa Reiffel; Boyko, Tatiana; Schwartz, Theodore H; Stieg, Philip E; Boockvar, John A; Spector, Jason A",Journal of neuro-oncology,76,12

GRP78 is a member of the 70 kDa heat shock family of proteins involved in correcting and clearing misfolded proteins in the ER. In response to cellular stress, GRP78 escapes from the ER and moves to the plasma membrane where it (i) functions as a receptor for many ligands, and (ii) behaves as an autoantigen for autoantibodies that contribute to human disease and cancer. Cell surface GRP78 (csGRP78) associates with the major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I), and is the port of entry for several viruses, including the predictive binding of the novel SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, csGRP78 is found in association with partners as diverse as the teratocarcinoma-derived growth factor 1 (Cripto), the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) and the DnaJ-like protein MTJ-1. CsGRP78 also serves as a receptor for a large variety of ligands including activated α2 -macroglobulin (α2 M*), plasminogen kringle 5 (K5), microplasminogen, the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), tissue factor (TF) and the prostate apoptosis response-4 protein (Par-4).

Secondary aim was to compare the results with those obtained in a matched population treated with drug-eluting beads transarterial chemoembolization alone. METHODS 40 consecutive cirrhotic patients with single HCC were prospectively enrolled and treated. Twenty-three patients had tumours between 3 and 5cm (Group A), and 17 larger than 5cm (Group B). Twenty cirrhotic patients with single HCC treated only with chemoembolization formed the control group. RESULTS Complete response at 1 month was achieved in 32/40 tumours (80%). During follow-up, complete response was maintained in 25 patients (25/40, 62.5%), and this rate was higher in Group A (69.6% vs 53%, p=0.008). The group treated with combined therapy showed a significantly lower 2-year recurrence (48.1% vs 78.2%, p<0.001) and significantly higher survival (91.1% vs 60.6%, p=0.004) than the group treated with chemoembolization alone. CONCLUSIONS Balloon-occluded-radiofrequency ablation plus drug-eluting beads transarterial chemoembolization is an effective treatment of HCC larger than 3cm not amenable to surgical resection, providing better results than transarterial chemoembolization alone. The best results are achieved in tumours up to 5cm.","Iezzi, Roberto; Pompili, Maurizio; La Torre, Michele Fabio; Campanale, Maria Chiara; Montagna, Martina; Saviano, Antonio; Cesario, Valentina; Siciliano, Massimo; Annicchiarico, Eleonora; Agnes, Salvatore; Giuliante, Felice; Grieco, Antonio; Rapaccini, Gian Lodovico; De Gaetano, Anna Maria; Gasbarrini, Antonio; Bonomo, Lorenzo",Digestive and liver disease : official journal of the Italian Society of Gastroenterology and the Italian Association for the Study of the Liver,76,2

The virus was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and continues to be endemic in the region. Most of the initial MERS-CoV cases in 2012 and early 2013 were sporadic, and it remains unclear whether MERS-CoV was circulating before 2012 or not. Therefore, we tried here to find any molecular evidence of MERS-CoV circulation in humans before or during 2012 in the city of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. METHODOLOGY We examined 349 archived respiratory samples collected between January 2010 and December 2012 from patients with acute respiratory illnesses from the city of Jeddah in Western Saudi Arabia. All samples were screened for MERS-CoV by real-time RT-PCR targeting the upstream E-gene (UpE) and the open reading frame 1 a (ORF1a). RESULTS All tested samples which were originally found negative for influenza A H1N1 virus were also found to be negative for MERS-CoV. CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that circulation of MERS-CoV was uncommon among patients with acute respiratory symptoms in Western Saudi Arabia between 2010 and 2012.","Alamoudi, Reem J; Azhar, Leena E; Alamoudi, Dareen H; Alamoudi, Dena H; Tolah, Ahmed M; Alhabbab, Rowa Yousef; Azhar, Esam I; Hashem, Anwar M",Journal of infection in developing countries,76,1

The aim of the present study was to develop and assess a TMA containing 32 primary canine insulinomas and 13 insulinoma metastases. The results of histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses of triplicate core biopsies were compared with those of individual tissue sections using weighted κ statistics. Inter-observer agreement of TMA immunohistochemistry scores were assessed for chromogranin A (CgA), insulin, growth hormone (GH), growth hormone receptor (GHR) and Ki67 index, as well as the prognostic utility of clinicopathological, histopathological and immunohistochemical criteria. There was substantial agreement of scores for histopathological parameters (κ = 0.64-0.70) and a substantial to near-perfect agreement for homogenous immunohistochemical parameters (κ = 0.69-1.00). Except for GH, which demonstrated heterogeneous staining, there was good to excellent inter-observer agreement for all other immunohistochemical staining scores (intra-class correlation coefficients: 0.70-1.00). On univariate analysis, the presence of nuclear atypia was significantly predictive of disease-free intervals (DFIs) for canine insulinoma, while tumour size, TNM stage, necrosis and Ki67 index were significant in terms of prognosis, with respect to both DFI and survival time. On multivariate analysis, tumour size and Ki67 index retained predictive power for survival time, as did tumour size for DFI. This study confirms the applicability of TMA technology for evaluation of canine insulinoma.","Buishand, Floryne O; Visser, Judith; Kik, Marja; Gröne, Andrea; Keesler, Rebekah I; Briaire-de Bruijn, Inge H; Kirpensteijn, Jolle",Veterinary journal,76,16

Early prediction whether and when cognitive decline from normal cognition (NC) will occur is crucial for preventing or delaying the progression timely. The current study aimed to provide a personalized risk assessment of CI by using baseline information and establishing a multi-predictor nomogram. METHODS 108 patients with PD were collected from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI), of whom 58 had progressed to CI and 50 remained NC during 5-year follow up. Radiomics signatures were obtained by using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression algorithm. Clinical factors and laboratory biomarkers were selected by multivariate Cox regression analysis. The combined model of radiomics signatures and clinical risk factors was developed by a multivariate Cox proportional hazard model. A multi-predictor nomogram derived from the combined model was established for individualized estimation of time to progress (TTP) of CI. We analyzed the risk of two subgroups of the combined model by Kaplan-Meier (KM) analysis. RESULTS The combined model showed the best performance with a C-index of 0.988 and 0.926 in the training and validation datasets. KM analysis verified significant TTP of CI (P＜0.05) between two subgroups stratified by the cutoff values (-0.058) . CONCLUSION The combined model and its multi-predictor nomogram can be used to perfectly and individually predict the TTP of CI for patients with PD. Stratification of PD will benefit its timely clinical intervention and the delay and prevention of CI.","Tang, Chunyan; Zhao, Xiaoyan; Wu, Wei; Zhong, Weijia; Wu, Xiaojia",Neuroscience letters,76,16

Clinical laboratories face ethical challenges in responding to emerging pathogens. We use the 2014-2015 outbreak of Ebola virus disease as a model to explore some of the ethical issues in laboratory medicine related to emerging infectious disease. OBJECTIVE To describe the major ethical concerns raised in the clinical laboratory environment by emerging infections. DATA SOURCES We assessed current guidelines and practices in the Ebola outbreak in developed-world clinical laboratories, reviewed risk assessment practices and the role of the clinical laboratory in providing care for patients with potential or confirmed Ebola, and reviewed the relevant literature on duty to provide care in the laboratory context. CONCLUSIONS Clinical laboratories in developed countries have to rely more on expert guidelines and theoretical risk assessments than on practice in less-developed areas. Risk minimization for clinical laboratory workers is essential but may conflict with the laboratory's duty to provide standard of care. Patients can be put at risk not only from loss of laboratory services from restriction of testing but also from impairment of laboratory services in cases of spills or accidents. Significant discrepancies in guidelines from professional and governmental sources exacerbate the difficulty and confusion inherent in dealing with a dynamic, emerging infectious disease crisis. The duty to provide care for laboratory workers is ill-defined. Balancing risks to patients and laboratory workers and benefits to patients presents challenges to laboratory professionals at all levels.","Dubov, Alex; Appleton, Julia H; Campbell, Sheldon",Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,76,5

The effects of feed temperature, feed velocity and permeate velocity on temperature polarization were mainly investigated for a high-concentration NaCl solution. The temperature polarization was increased with the increase of feed temperature and the decrease of feed and permeate velocity. The effects of temperature, inlet velocity and solution concentration on the evaporation efficiency of the membrane module for co- and counter-current operations were investigated in detail. The counter-current operation performed better than co-current operation in most cases, except for the condition where the NaCl concentration was relatively low or the module length was long enough. In addition, the optimal membrane thickness for both PVDF and PTFE was studied. The optimal membrane thickness was found in the range of 10 to 20 μm, which corresponded to the highest permeate flux for the selected materials, pore size distribution, and operation conditions. Membrane material with lower thermal conductivity and larger porosity was prone to get higher permeate flux and had larger optimal membrane thickness. Increasing feed velocity or feed temperature could decrease the optimal membrane thickness.","Ni, Weiming; Li, Yongli; Zhao, Juezhen; Zhang, Gaoyuan; Du, Xiaoze; Dong, Yingchao",Membranes,76,16

ISTL8 along with the production of EPS (Extracellular polymeric substances) using carbofuran, a toxic carbamate pesticide. Bacillus strain was isolated from landfill soil and evaluated for high growth rates and EPS production. One strain, renamed ISTL8 grew on a broad range of carbon sources, including toxic carbofuran, while producing copious EPS. Growth assays verified the strain to be thermophilic, low salt tolerant, and with a preference for neutral pH. SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) was used for morphological characterization of the EPS while the monomeric composition, bonding patterns and functional groups were deduced by GC-MS (Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry), 1H and 13C NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) and FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy). The production of EPS using carbofuran (carbamate pesticide) as a carbon source was found to be 6.20 ± 0.29 g L-1 containing 61.17% w/w carbohydrates, 29.72% w/w proteins and 6.11% w/w lipids (of dry EPS). The potential cytotoxicity of EPS was evaluated with 3- (4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-Yl) -2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and found non-toxic (2.25%). WGS (Whole genome sequencing) was performed for the strain Bacillus sp. ISTL8 producing EPS; an array of genes putatively involved in the EPS production were identified in several different genomic locations, guiding potential genetic manipulation studies in the future. The results highlight the potency of a bacterial isolate Bacillus sp. ISTL8 to produce non-cytotoxic EPS using carbofuran that can be further harnessed for environmental and commercial applications. Additionally, WGS revealed an array of EPS specific genes which can be effectively engineered for much enhanced production.","Gupta, Juhi; Rathour, Rashmi; Dupont, Christopher L; Kaul, Drishti; Thakur, Indu Shekhar",Environmental research,76,1

Colonoscopy revealed a submucosal tumor, which measured 3 cm in diameter, in the sigmoid colon. Endoscopic ultrasonography revealed a low echoic, homogeneous and demarcated submucosal tumor that continued into the fourth layer of the colonic wall. Gastrointestinal stromal, myogenic or neurogenic tumor was suspected, and thus, laparoscopic sigmoidectomy was carried out. We used two ports during the operation, a SILS Port in the umbilical region and a 12-mm port in the right lower abdominal wall, and performed sigmoidectomy with D2 lymph node dissection. Histological findings revealed spindle-like tumor cells with multiform nuclei. The tumor was diagnosed by immunostaining as benign schwannoma of the sigmoid colon. The conventional surgical treatment for schwannoma of the digestive tract is partial resection, but if preoperative diagnosis is unknown, radical resection with lymphadenectomy is acceptable for submucosal tumors in the digestive tract. In this case, laparoscopic reduced port surgery using only one or two ports may be more feasible and beneficial with regard to cosmesis and reduced postoperative pain than conventional laparoscopic colectomy.","Tokuhara, Katsuji; Nakatani, Kazuyoshi; Oishi, Masaharu; Iwamoto, Shigeyoshi; Inoue, Kentaro; Kwon, A-Hon",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,76,31

This study describes the trajectory of psychosocial symptoms in the last six months of life among cancer decedents who were receiving home care. METHODS Observational population-based cohort study of cancer decedents who were receiving home care services between 2007 and 2014. Decedents had to have at least 1 home care assessment in the last six months of life for inclusion. Outcomes were the presence of psychosocial symptoms (i.e. anxiety, loneliness, depression, social decline, caregiver distress, and cognitive decline) at each week before death. RESULTS Our cohort included 27,295 unique cancer decedents (30,368 assessments), of which 58% died in hospital. Fifty-six percent were older than 74 and 47% were female. The prevalence of all symptoms increased approaching death, except loneliness. Social decline (48% to 78%) was the most prevalent psychosocial symptom, though loneliness was reported in less than 10% of the cohort. Caregiver distress rose over time from 15% to 27%. A third of the cohort reported issues with cognitive impairment. Multivariate regression showed that physical symptoms such as uncontrolled pain, impairment in Independent Activities of Daily Living, and a high level of health instability all significantly worsened the odds of having a psychosocial symptom in the last 3 months of life. CONCLUSION In this large home care cancer cohort, trajectories of psychosocial symptoms worsened close to death. Physical symptoms, such as uncontrolled pain, were associated with having worse psychosocial symptoms at end of life. This article is protected by copyright.

RECENT FINDINGS Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) have long been known as the most common cause of common cold in infants and children. Recent developments in molecular diagnostics have led to the discovery of new viruses and have also provided data to implicate HRV as an important cause of lower respiratory infections and acute virus-induced wheezing in preschool children. In addition, HRV-induced wheezing episodes appear to identify children who are at increased risk for the subsequent development of childhood asthma. SUMMARY Collectively, these findings raise the possibility that lower respiratory infections with pathogens such as HRV and respiratory syncytial virus could participate in the causation of asthma, especially in children with suboptimal antiviral defenses. A variety of experimental models and clinical studies have been used to identify possible mechanisms related to the infection and the ensuing host response that could disturb normal lung and immunologic development to promote asthma. Defining these relationships could lead to new therapeutic and preventive approaches to common forms of childhood asthma.","Gern, James E",Current opinion in allergy and clinical immunology,76,1

Perinatal anxiety is one such challenge, and is an important contributor to parental distress and other negative outcomes. Sleep and biological rhythms are often disrupted in the perinatal period. These disruptions have been associated with postpartum depression, and in some cases with perinatal anxiety. However, the literature concerning the association with perinatal anxiety is inconsistent and may be methodologically limited. To our knowledge, there has been no comprehensive review published characterising the relationships between sleep, biological rhythms, and perinatal anxiety and related disorders to date. In this systematic review, we will summarise the current state of the literature concerning these relationships, allowing us to highlight gaps and potentially inform clinical understanding of perinatal anxiety, sleep and biological rhythms. METHODS AND ANALYSIS Primary research articles will be eligible for inclusion if they assess perinatal anxiety or related disorders using validated criteria (self-report or diagnostic), assess sleep and biological rhythms in the perinatal period, include >4 participants and meet other inclusion/exclusion criteria. We will conduct comprehensive searches of MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase and CINAHL, with coverage spanning from database conception to search date (August 1, 2021). Key search concepts include (1) the perinatal period, (2) sleep/biological rhythms and (3) anxiety. Risk of bias will be evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Data will be narratively synthesised, with quantitative synthesis included if possible. When relevant, strength of evidence will be assessed using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation criteria, and potential publication bias will be assessed. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Research ethics approval is not required. Study results will be reported according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Results will be disseminated to relevant stakeholders as conference presentation(s) and submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

Oral administration of SN-GLY, SN and GLY one hour prior to radiation exposure reduced the radiation induced damage in peripheral blood leucocytes, bone marrow cells and spleen cells of mice as revealed by comet assay. Exposure of mice to whole body gamma irradiation resulted in formation of micronuclei in blood reticulocytes and chromosomal aberrations in bone marrow cells while SN-GLY, SN or GLY administration resulted in reduction in micronucleus formation and chromosomal aberrations indicating radioprotection. In SN-GLY treated mice the cellular DNA was found protected to a greater extent compared to GLY or SN treated mice.

We herein describe a 35-year-old Asian man with pulmonary tuberculosis and perforated duodenal ulcer who presented with hyponatremia with hourly fluctuating urine osmolality ranging from 100 to 600 mosmol/kg, which resembled urine osmolality observed in typical polydipsia and SIADH simultaneously. Further review revealed correlation of body temperature and urine osmolality. Since fever is a known non-osmotic stimulus of ADH secretion, we theorized that hyponatremia in this patient was due to transient ADH secretion due to fever. In our case, empiric exogenous glucocorticoid suppressed transient non-osmotic ADH secretion and urine osmolality showed highly variable concentrations. Transient ADH secretion-related hyponatremia may be underrecognized due to occasional empiric glucocorticoid administration in patients with critical illnesses. Repeatedly monitoring of urine chemistries and interpretation of urine chemistries with careful review of non-osmotic stimuli of ADH including fever is crucial in recognition of this etiology. Learning points Hourly fluctuations in urine osmolality can be observed in patients with fever, which is a non-osmotic stimulant of ADH secretion. Repeated monitoring of urine chemistries aids in the diagnosis of the etiology underlying hyponatremia, including fever, in patients with transient ADH secretion. Glucocorticoid administration suppresses ADH secretion and improves hyponatremia even in the absence of adrenal insufficiency; the etiology of hyponatremia should be determined carefully in these patients.","Son, Raku; Nagahama, Masahiko; Tanemoto, Fumiaki; Ito, Yugo; Taki, Fumika; Tsugitomi, Ryosuke; Nakayama, Masaaki","Endocrinology, diabetes & metabolism case reports",76,1

Among these is an increase in the dispersal of pests and pathogens across the globe. International trade has been implicated in outbreaks of several re-occurring livestock diseases. This paper is focused on the risk of foot and mouth disease (FMD) associated with the international trade in live animals. A model was used to estimate FMD risk as a function of the international trade in live animals, controlling for the biosecurity measures undertaken by importing and exporting countries, and for the presence of endemic FMD reservoirs. It was found that the indirect risks associated with exports may be as great as the direct risks associated with imports. For countries where livestock production occurs in disease-free zones (with or without vaccination), the trade risks vary with both species and trading partner. These findings may assist the targeting of disease risk mitigation activities.","Shanafelt, D W; Perrings, C A",Revue scientifique et technique,76,1

As provider workload increases, it is important to focus on a means to improve communication efficiency. Our goal was to increase the percentage of HM admissions using 1-way communication from 0% to 35% over a 16-month period. METHODS HM providers and PCPs collaborated to identify 12 admission diagnoses for which 1-way communication could be used. Using quality improvement methods, we studied the implementation of ""Leave a Message"" (LAM) calls for 1-way communication and providing PCPs with the option to place a return call. Control charts were used to track LAM call use and balancing measures of PCP return phone calls, additional PCP communications, and 7-day readmissions over time. RESULTS A total of 778 LAM calls were placed by HM providers over 16 months. The percentage of LAM calls out of all PCP calls placed ranged from 0% to 35% during this time, increasing significantly during winter months and before the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Only 0.4% (n = 3) of LAM calls were returned by PCPs. Estimated PCP return phone calls were reduced by 11.1 calls per week. CONCLUSIONS We created a system for 1-way telephone communication between HM providers and PCPs for common, simple admissions and reduced the need for PCP return phone calls. The low percentage of LAM calls returned by PCPs may suggest that 1-way communication is adequate for most simple admissions.","Ostermeier, Austin; Ferro, Erica; Voet, Shelly; Warniment, Amanda; Albrecht, Jennifer; Manfroy, Pierre; Gosdin, Craig",Hospital pediatrics,76,31

OBJECTIVE To describe the relationship between the pressure generated at the airway opening and flow through a nasal cannula using a simulated infant model. We hypothesized that positive pressure generated by a standard cannula at flows > 2 L/min would be minimal and clinically unimportant. METHODS Nares were simulated with holes drilled in a plastic fixture. A nares template for CPAP prongs served as a sizing template for the holes. Small, medium, and large nares fixtures were constructed and connected to a lung simulator that simulated spontaneous breathing. Respiratory muscle pressure was simulated by setting a waveform and adjusting the amplitude to deliver a range of tidal volumes (V(T)) from 3 mL to 12 mL. Lung compliance and resistance were set at 0.5 mL/cm H(2)O and 125 cm H(2)O/L/s, respectively. Nasal cannulas were inserted in the model nares. We assured that the prong occlusion of the nares did not exceed 50%. Cannula flow was adjusted from 2-6 L/min in 1-L/min increments. Data were averaged over 20 breaths. Mean airway pressure and percent change in V(T) were recorded. RESULTS The greatest effect on V(T) (mean ± SD 0.16 ± 0.10 mL) and pressure change (mean ± SD 0.7 ± 0.5 cm H(2)O) occurred with the premature cannula. The least effect on pressure (mean ± SD 0.3 ± 0.22 cm H(2)O) and V(T) change (mean ± SD 0.01 ± 0.02 mL) occurred with the infant cannula. CONCLUSIONS Clinically important pressures were not generated by high flows with a standard nasal cannula. The differences in spontaneous V(T) across all flows were negligible.","Volsko, Teresa A; Fedor, Kathy; Amadei, Jason; Chatburn, Robert L",Respiratory care,76,1

In latter half 19th century medical uniforms started to change. Nursing uniforms gradually lost their similarities to religious outfits. Doctors started to use white clothing. With great emphasis on hygiene and sanitation, the idea of personal protective equipment (PPE) started to evolve with William Stewart Halsted introducing the use of rubber gloves in 1889. In the 1960s-1970s it became more usual to wear green and blue `scrubs in order to look for a greater contrast in clothing with the all-white hospital environment. In contemporary times, some specialties even stopped using specific uniforms, while others still use them.

We evaluated the efficacy of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) with the contrast-enhancing agent Sonazoid for precisely assessing the therapeutic effect of PRFA for HCC. METHODS We enrolled 87 consecutive patients with solitary naïve HCC of less than 3 cm in diameter. PRFA treatment was performed with a 17-G cool-tip needle, and CEUS was performed to assess the ablative margin 3 h after the procedure, when the coagulated tumor outline was easiest to discern. The treatment was repeated until an ablative margin greater than 5 mm was confirmed. After CEUS assessment of the therapeutic response, the patients were followed to investigate local tumor recurrence. RESULTS In 78 patients (89.7%), the outline of the coagulated tumors could be recognized by ultrasonography, and CEUS assessment of the ablative margin was successful. The remaining nine patients were assessed by computed tomography. The 5-year cumulative survival rate after the assessment of the treatment response with CEUS was 58.4%, and the 4-year cumulative total recurrence rate was 72.3%. The 5-year cumulative local tumor recurrence rate was very low (2.3%). CONCLUSION The assessment with CEUS at 3 h after the PRFA procedure was successful in the majority of the patients, and it yielded a very low rate of local recurrence.","Nishigaki, Yoichi; Hayashi, Hideki; Tomita, Eiichi; Suzuki, Yusuke; Watanabe, Naoki; Watanabe, Satoshi; Watanabe, Chiaki; Takagi, Yui; Kato, Tomohiro; Naiki, Takafumi",Hepatology research : the official journal of the Japan Society of Hepatology,76,23

METHODS This retrospective study was conducted on consecutive patients who underwent computed tomography-guided MWA of early-stage NSCLC (no evidence of nodal or distant metastasis) from November 2010 to December 2014 at our institution. Data were collected from systematic review of patient charts and imaging. Procedural complications, response to treatment and survival were assessed. RESULTS 34 early-stage (T1a-T3N0M0) NSCLCs in 30 patients were treated with a total of 41 MWA sessions. There were no intraprocedural or 30-day post-procedural deaths. The most common complication was pneumothorax, encountered in 24 (59%) microwave ablation sessions, six (15%) of which required chest tube insertion. Over a median computed tomography follow-up period of 39 months (range 3-89), 24 (71%) NSCLCs demonstrated local control, while 10 (29%) demonstrated local progression. Nodal/distant progression was more common than local progression, with 15 of the 30 patients (50%) having nodal or distant metastases at follow-up. Patient survival status was followed up over a median period of 56.5 months (range 10-107). Median overall survival and 5-year overall survival were 56.5 months (95% confidence interval, 26-not reached) and 46.7% (95% confidence interval, 31.8-68.4), respectively. CONCLUSION MWA is safe and effective at achieving local control of early-stage NSCLC and may prolong patient survival. Nodal or distant metastases were the dominant manifestations of disease progression at long-term follow-up.","Zhao, Henry; Steinke, Karin",Journal of medical imaging and radiation oncology,76,1

We sought to explore the effects of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination on disparities in cervical cancer incidence between high- and low-poverty U.S. counties. METHODS We calibrated a dynamic simulation model of HPV infection to reflect average counties in the highest and lowest quartile of poverty (percent of population below federal poverty level), incorporating data on HPV prevalence, cervical cancer screening, and HPV vaccination. We projected cervical cancer incidence through 2070, estimated absolute and relative disparities in incident cervical cancer for high- versus low-poverty counties, and compared incidence with the near-elimination target (4 cases/100,000 women annually). RESULTS We estimated that, on average, low-poverty counties will achieve near-elimination targets 14 years earlier than high-poverty counties (2029 vs. 2043). Absolute disparities by county poverty will decrease, but relative differences are estimated to increase. We estimate 21,604 cumulative excess cervical cancer cases in high-poverty counties over the next 50 years. Increasing HPV vaccine coverage nationally to the Healthy People 2020 goal (80%) would reduce excess cancer cases, but not alter estimated time to reach the near-elimination threshold. CONCLUSIONS High-poverty U.S. counties will likely be delayed in achieving near-elimination targets for cervical cancer and as a result will experience thousands of potentially preventable cancers. IMPACT Alongside vaccination efforts, it is important to address the role of social determinants and health care access in driving persistent inequities by area poverty.","Spencer, Jennifer C; Brewer, Noel T; Coyne-Beasley, Tamera; Trogdon, Justin G; Weinberger, Morris; Wheeler, Stephanie B","Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",76,31

Human behavior, affected by knowledge and perceptions, may influence the course of disease. METHODOLOGY A structured questionnaire was used to collect data from 422 participants. It consisted of 28 questions in four sections; seven questions about sociodemographic characteristics of participants, 12 questions to estimate level of knowledge about COVID-19, six questions to evaluate attitudes toward disease, and three questions to assess practices to prevent disease transmission. RESULTS Their overall understanding of COVID-19 was satisfactory. 69% of the participants had satisfactory levels of knowledge, and the main sources of information were social media platforms (79.70%) and television (70.90%). There was a significant difference in knowledge as a function of gender (p = 0.50), occupation (p = 0.012), and smoking (p = 0.041). The participants held optimistic attitudes and adopted appropriate protective measures. Most participants agreed that COVID-19 can cause death (64.7%), poses greater risks to elderly (93.4%) and those with chronic diseases (96.7%), it is mandatory to quarantine infected individuals (98.1%), preventive health measures are important (97.6%), and health authorities will succeed in controlling the pandemic (67.5%). There was a statistically significant association between satisfactory levels of knowledge and the practice of wearing masks and the adoption of protective measures (avoiding crowded places, frequent hand washing).

Our objective was to evaluate if prone positioning is associated with a reduced intubation rate when compared to usual care. METHODS Retrospective cohort study in the emergency department of a large quaternary hospital in Sao Paulo. We retrieved data from all admitted patients in need of oxygen supplementation (> 3 L/min) and tachypnea (> 24 ipm) from March 1st to April 30th, excluding those who had any contraindication to the prone position or who had an immediate need for intubation. The primary endpoint was endotracheal intubation up to 15 days. Secondary outcomes included a 6-point clinical outcome ordinal scale, mechanical ventilation free-days, admission to the ICU, need of hemodialysis and of vasoactive drugs, all assessed at or up to 15 days. We analyzed unadjusted and adjusted effect estimates with Cox proportional Hazards models, logistic regression, quantile regression and sensitivity analyses using propensity score models. RESULTS Of 925 suspected COVID-19 patients admitted off mechanical ventilation, 166 patients fulfilled inclusion and exclusion criteria: 57 were exposed to prone positioning and 109 to usual care. In the intervention group, 33 (58%) were intubated versus 53 (49%) in the control group. We observed no difference in intubation rates in the univariate analysis (hazard ratio, 1.21; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.88; p=0.39) neither in the adjusted analysis (hazard ratio, 0.90; 95% CI 0.55 to 1.49; p=0.69). Results were robust to the sensitivity analyses. Secondary outcomes did not differ between groups. CONCLUSIONS Awake prone positioning was not associated with lower intubation rates.

This prospective study evaluated laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy for its safety and efficiency in excess weight loss (%EWL) in super superobese patients (BMI >60 Kg/m(2)). Results. Thirty patients (33 women and 7 men) were included, with mean age of 35 years (range 18 to 59). Mean preoperative BMI was 66 Kg/m(2) (range 60 to 85). The study included one patient with complete situs inversus and 4 (14%) with previous restrictive gastric banding. The mean operative time was 120 minutes (range 80 to 220 min) and the mean hospital stay was 7.5 days (4 to 28 days). There was no postoperative mortality or need for a laparotomy conversion. Two subphrenic hematomas, one gastric fistula, and one pulmonary embolism, were the major complications. After 18 months 17 (77%) had sufficient weight loss and six had insufficient results, leading to either re-sleeve gastrectomy (3), or gastric bypass (2). Three years after the initial laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy, the mean EWL was 51% (range 21 to 82). Conclusion. The laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy is a safe and efficient operating procedure for treating super superobesity. In the case of insufficient weight loss, a second-stage operation like resleeve gastrectomy or gastric bypass can be proposed.","Catheline, J-M; Fysekidis, M; Dbouk, R; Boschetto, A; Bihan, H; Reach, G; Cohen, R",Journal of obesity,76,27

Our aim was to investigate the association between glucose variability and postoperative complications following total joint arthroplasty. METHODS We analyzed data on 21,487 patients who had undergone total hip arthroplasty (THA) or total knee arthroplasty (TKA) at a single center from 2001 to 2017. Patients with a minimum of 2 postoperative glucose values per day or >3 values overall were included in the study. Glucose variability was assessed using a coefficient of variation. Adverse outcomes included an increased length of stay in the hospital, 90-day mortality, reoperations, periprosthetic joint infection, and surgical site infection. Periprosthetic joint infection was defined using the Musculoskeletal Infection Society criteria. RESULTS The final cohort included 2,360 patients who had undergone THA and 2,698 who had undergone TKA; 1,007 (19.9%) had diabetes. Higher glycemic variability was associated with an increased length of stay, 90-day mortality, periprosthetic joint infection, and surgical site infection. Adjusted analysis indicated that for every 10-percentage-point increase in the coefficient of variation, the length of stay increased by 6.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.1% to 7.2%; p < 0.001), the risk of mortality increased by 26% (odds ratio [OR] = 1.26, 95% CI = 0.98 to 1.61; p = 0.07), and the risks of periprosthetic joint infection and surgical site infection increased by 20% (OR = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.02 to 1.41; p = 0.03) and 14% (OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.00 to 1.31; p = 0.06), respectively. These associations were independent of the year of surgery, age, body mass index, Elixhauser comorbidity index, diagnosis of diabetes, in-hospital use of insulin or steroids, and mean glucose values during hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS Higher glucose variability in the postoperative period is associated with increased rates of surgical site and periprosthetic joint infections and may be a useful predictor of the risk of mortality following THA and TKA. Efforts should be made to control the glucose variability in the early postoperative period, and future studies should examine the role of continuous glucose monitoring in a subset of patients with high glucose fluctuations.

A humanized single-chain Fv antibody (huscFv) against the hemagglutinin (HA) of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAI) was used as the targeting molecule to HA of H5N1 virus, which is abundantly expressed on the surface of infected cells (the HA target cells). The huscFv was applied to cationic polyethylene glycol-conjugated 3β-[N-(N',N'-dimethylaminoethane) carbamoyl] cholesterol-dioleoylphosphatidyl ethanolamine (PEGylated DC-Chol-DOPE) liposomes to generate immunoliposomes for siRNA delivery. The immunoliposomes were shown to specifically bind HA-expressing Sf9 cells and demonstrated enhanced siRNA transfection efficiency. The siRNA transfection efficiency was significantly reduced after preincubation of the HA target cells with an excess amount of free huscFv. These results therefore demonstrated that the enhanced siRNA delivery by use of immunoliposomes was mediated via targeting by huscFv. Furthermore, the siRNA silencing effect was more pronounced when the immunoliposomes were administered 6 to 12 h post-H5N1 infection in MDCK cells compared with the nontargeted liposomes. This proof-of-concept study may contribute to the future design and development of an siRNA delivery system for combating viral infectious diseases in humans.","Khantasup, Kannika; Kopermsub, Phikulthong; Chaichoun, Kridsada; Dharakul, Tararaj",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,76,17

Return to high altitude after recovery from coronavirus disease 2019. High Alt Med Biol. 00:000-000, 2021.-With the increasing availability of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines and the eventual decline in the burden of the disease, it is anticipated that all forms of tourism, including travel to high altitude, will rebound in the near future. Given the physiologic challenges posed by hypobaric hypoxia at high altitude, it is useful to consider whether high-altitude travel will pose risks to those previously infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, particularly those with persistent symptoms after resolution of their infection. Although no studies have specifically examined this question as of yet, available data on the cardiopulmonary sequelae of COVID-19 provide some sense of the problems people may face at high altitude and who warrants evaluation before such endeavors. On average, most individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 have normal or near normal gas exchange, pulmonary function testing, cardiovascular function, and exercise capacity, although a subset of individuals have persistent functional deficits in some or all of these domains when examined up to 5 months after infection. Evaluation is warranted before planned high-altitude travel in individuals with persistent symptoms at least 2 weeks after a positive test or hospital discharge as well as in those who required care in an intensive care unit or suffered from myocarditis or arterial or venous thromboembolism. Depending on the results of this testing, planned high-altitude travel may need to be modified or even deferred pending resolution of the identified abnormalities. As more people travel to high altitude after the pandemic and further studies are conducted, additional data should become available to provide further guidance on these issues.","Luks, Andrew M; Grissom, Colin K",High altitude medicine & biology,76,2

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Prospective observational and case-control study during 2007 in a rural Kenyan district hospital. Participants were children aged 1 day to 12 years, residing in a systematically enumerated catchment area, and who either were admitted to Kilifi District Hospital meeting World Health Organization clinical criteria for severe pneumonia or very severe pneumonia; (2) presented with mild upper respiratory tract infection but were not admitted; or (3) were well infants and children attending for immunization. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The presence of respiratory viruses and the odds ratio for admission with severe disease. RESULTS Of 922 eligible admitted patients, 759 were sampled (82% [median age, 9 months]). One or more respiratory viruses were detected in 425 of the 759 sampled (56% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 52%-60%]). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was detected in 260 participants (34% [95% CI, 31%-38%]) and other respiratory viruses were detected in 219 participants (29%; 95% CI, 26%-32%), the most common being Human coronavirus 229E (n = 51 [6.7%]), influenza type A (n = 44 [5.8%]), Parainfluenza type 3 (n = 29 [3.8%]), Human adenovirus (n = 29 [3.8%]), and Human metapneumovirus (n = 23 [3.0%]).

Effect estimates were extracted and combined using random-effect model. Pooled mean differences and odds ratios for individual risk factors were calculated using inverse-variance method and Mantel-Haenszel method, as appropriate. RESULTS Eight articles with 1434 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Overall, the pooled estimated incidence rates of POD after LT were 30% (95% confidence interval: 20% - 39%). 14 statistically significant risk factors were identified in the pooled analysis: alcohol excess, preoperative renal replacement therapy (RRT), preoperative hospital length of stay (LOS), depression, hepatic encephalopathy, alcohol etiology of liver failure, Child-Turcotte-Pugh score, APACHE Ⅱscore, MELD score, preoperative INR, preoperative bilirubin, intraoperative use of fentanyl, intraoperative RBC transfusion, postoperative ammonia. Patients with POD had a significantly increased mechanical ventilation, postoperative RRT, LOS and mortality rate compared with those without POD.

METHODS A retrospective review of 215 patients undergoing ventral hernia repair (142 robotic and 73 laparoscopic) was completed at two large academic centers. Primary outcome measure evaluated was recurrence. Secondary outcomes included incidence of primary fascial closure, and surgical site occurrences. RESULTS Propensity for treatment match comparison demonstrated that robotic repair was associated with a decreased incidence of recurrence (2.1 versus 4.2%, p < 0.001) and surgical site occurrence (4.2 versus 18.8%, p < 0.001). This may be because robotic repair was associated with increased incidence of primary fascial closure (77.1 versus 66.7%, p < 0.01).

Herein, we describe a novel antibiotic-eluting pigtail catheter coated with electrospun nanofibers used for the sustained release of bactericidal concentrations of penicillin in the pleural space. METHODS Electrospun nanofibers prepared using polylactide-polyglycolide copolymer and penicillin G sodium dissolved in 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol were used to coat the surface of an Fr6 pigtail catheter. The in vitro patterns of drug release were tested by placing the catheter in phosphate-buffered saline. In vivo studies were performed using rabbits treated with penicillin either intrapleurally (Group 1, 20 mg delivered through the catheter) or systemically (Group 2, intramuscular injection, 10 mg/kg). Penicillin concentrations in the serum and pleural fluid were then measured and compared. RESULTS In vitro studies revealed a burst release of penicillin (10% of the total dose) occurring in the first 24 hours, followed by a sustained release in the subsequent 30 days. Intrapleural drug levels were significantly higher in Group 1 than in Group 2 (P<0.001). In the former, penicillin concentrations remained above the minimum inhibitory concentration breakpoint throughout the entire study period. In contrast, serum penicillin levels were significantly higher in Group 2 than in Group 1 (P<0.001). Notably, all Group 2 rabbits showed signs of systemic toxicity (paralytic ileus and weight loss).

Viruses have been demonstrated to cause a large proportion of these infections, both in children and adults. BACKGROUND The diagnosis of viral bronchopulmonary infections is based on the analysis of secretions, collected from the lower respiratory tract when possible, by techniques that detect either influenza and respiratory syncytial viruses, or a large panel of viruses that can be responsible for respiratory disease. The latter, called multiplex PCR assays, allow a syndromic approach to respiratory infection. Their high cost for the laboratory raises the question of their place in the management of patients in terms of antibiotic economy and isolation. In the absence of clear recommendations, the strategy and equipment are very unevenly distributed in France. OUTLOOK Medico-economic analyses need to be performed in France to evaluate the place of these tests in the management of patients. The evaluation of the role of the different viruses often detected in co-infection, especially in children, also deserves the attention of virologists and clinicians. CONCLUSIONS The availability of new diagnostic technologies, the recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2, together with the availability of new antiviral drugs are likely to impact future recommendations for the management of viral bronchopulmonary infections.","Pillet, S; Gueudin, M; Plantier, J C; Vabret, A",Revue des maladies respiratoires,76,22

A feature of the clinical syndrome of COVID-19 is the development of pronounced immunopathological reactions and disorders of hemostasis, leading to the development of a wide range of cardiovascular complications. The course of COVID-19 may be complicated by the development of acute myocardial infarction, venous and arterial thrombosis and thromboembolism in various vascular pools, the development of acute myocardial damage and myocarditis. Among the gastroenterological manifestations, diarrhea, nausea or vomiting, as well as abdominal pain, are most often detected. These symptoms may precede the appearance of respiratory signs of the disease, and in some cases come to the fore in the clinical picture of the disease.

STUDY DESIGN Ex vivo; randomized block design (dog). SAMPLE POPULATION Carotid artery segments (n = 90) from 15 canine cadavers. METHODS Six 10-mm LigaSure Atlas 20 cm devices (Covidien Inc, Minneapolis, Minnesota) were used to seal canine carotid artery segments in one cadaver, then resterilized using ethylene oxide and reused in a second cadaver, and so on, for a total of 15 uses/15 cadavers per LigaSure. Sealing times and bursting pressures of each carotid artery segment after each use were recorded. Charring and sticking at each seal location was qualitatively assessed. RESULTS Mean (SD) sealing time for all segments was 5.3 (1.4) seconds, ranging from 2.7 to 9.5 seconds. There was no significant change in sealing time for successive uses (P = .117). The mean (SD) bursting pressure for all segments was 1041.3 (316.7) mm Hg, ranging from 355 to 1555 mm Hg. There was no change in bursting pressure across uses (P = .57).

It is imperative that AMD care is timely, appropriate, and evidence-based. It is thus essential that AMD systematic reviews are robust; however, little is known about the quality of this literature. Objectives To investigate the methodological quality of systematic reviews of AMD intervention studies, and to evaluate their use for guiding evidence-based care. Evidence Review This systematic review adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. All studies that self-identified as a systematic review in their title or abstract or were categorized as a systematic review from a medical subject heading and investigated the safety, efficacy and/or effectiveness of an AMD intervention were included. Comprehensive electronic searches were performed in Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from inception to March 2017. Two reviewers independently assessed titles and abstracts, then full-texts for eligibility. Quality was assessed using the Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) tool. Study characteristics (publication year, type of intervention, journal, citation rate, and funding source) were extracted. Findings Of 983 citations retrieved, 71 studies (7.6%) were deemed eligible. The first systematic review relating to an AMD intervention was published in 2003. More than half were published since 2014. Methodological quality was highly variable. The mean (SD) AMSTAR score was 5.8 (3.2) of 11.0, with no significant improvement over time (r = -0.03; 95% CI, -0.26 to 0.21; P = .83). Cochrane systematic reviews were overall of higher quality than reviews in other journals (mean [SD] AMSTAR score, 9.9 [1.2], n = 15 vs 4.7 [2.2], n = 56; P < .001). Overall, there was poor adherence to referring to an a priori design (22 articles [31%]) and reporting conflicts of interest in both the review and included studies (16 articles [23%]). Reviews funded by government grants and/or institutions were generally of higher quality than industry-sponsored reviews or where the funding source was not reported. Conclusions and Relevance There are gaps in the conduct of systematic reviews in the field of AMD. Enhanced endorsement of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement by refereed journals may improve review quality and improve the dissemination of reliable evidence relating to AMD interventions to clinicians.","Downie, Laura E; Makrai, Eve; Bonggotgetsakul, Yokim; Dirito, Lucy J; Kristo, Kresimir; Pham, Minh-An N; You, Mina; Verspoor, Karin; Pianta, Michael J",JAMA ophthalmology,76,27

This study assessed associations between chemsex and a wide range of determinants among MSM visiting STI clinics to increase understanding of characteristics and beliefs of MSM practicing chemsex. METHODS In 2018, 785 MSM were recruited at nine Dutch STI clinics; 368 (47%) fully completed the online questionnaire. All participants reported to have had sex in the past six months. Chemsex was defined as using cocaine, crystal meth, designer drugs, GHB/GBL, ketamine, speed or XTC/MDMA during sex in the past six months. Associations between chemsex and psychosocial determinants, socio-demographics, sexual behaviour and using tobacco or alcohol were assessed by multivariable logistic regression analyses. RESULTS Chemsex was reported by 44% of MSM (161/368) and was not associated with socio-demographics. Independent determinants were 'believing that the majority of friends/sex partners use drugs during sex' (descriptive norm) (aOR: 1.95, 95%CI: 1.43-2.65), 'believing that sex is more fun when using drugs' (attitude) (aOR: 2.06, 95%CI: 1.50-2.84), using tobacco (aOR: 2.65, 95%CI: 1.32-5.32), multiple sex partners (aOR: 2.69, 95%CI: 1.21-6.00), group sex (aOR: 4.65, 95%CI: 1.54-14.05) and using online dating platforms (aOR: 2.73, 95%CI: 1.13-6.62). CONCLUSION MSM are likely to find themselves in distinct social networks where it is the norm to use drugs when having sex and pleasure is linked to chemsex. Health services should acknowledge the social influence and pleasurable experiences to increase acceptability of strategies aimed at minimizing the possible harms of chemsex.","Evers, Ymke J; Geraets, Jill J H; Van Liere, Geneviève A F S; Hoebe, Christian J P A; Dukers-Muijrers, Nicole H T M",PloS one,76,1

However, because of the current lack of efficient and fast carrier radiation recombination pathways, the research on scintillator radioluminescence (RL) still faces severe challenges. Here, we propose an effective interface carrier transport mechanism: CsI:Na crystal and Cs4PbBr6 nanocrystals (NCs) interface to form a new phase and a continuous heterostructure, providing an effective channel for X-ray excited carrier transfer to Cs4PbBr6. Then, the excited carriers realize efficient recombination luminescence through the self-trapped excitons inside Cs4PbBr6. On the basis of this mechanism, the heterostructure composite scintillator composed of CsI:Na/Cs4PbBr6 exhibits high-efficiency radiant fluorescence and an ultrafast photoluminescence (PL) decay time of 1.22 ns. The effective interface carrier transport shown in this work provides an optimization idea that can be used for reference in the research of fast scintillators.","Ding, Ying; Lin, Richeng; Liang, Yali; Zheng, Wei; Chen, Liang; Ouyang, Xiao; Ouyang, Xiaoping; Huang, Feng",The journal of physical chemistry letters,76,28

It occurs when the concentration of methaemoglobin rises via ferrous haeme irons becoming oxidised to the ferric state, which shifts the oxygen dissociation curve to the left. The net result of an elevated methaemoglobin concentration is functional anaemia and impaired oxygen delivery to tissues. At lower blood levels, this can cause symptoms such as cyanosis, lethargy, headache and fatigue, whereas at higher levels it can be fatal. Here we discuss a subtle case of dapsone-induced methaemoglobinaemia presenting as subacute mental status changes and apparent hypoxia, thus highlighting the association between methaemoglobinaemia and dapsone.

The guideline recommends cemental augmentation for painful vertebral lesions in patients with malignant diagnosis, either hematological or non-hematological. Fracture of the posterior wall is not a contradiction to cemental augmentation, but care should always be taken while injecting the cement, to decrease the risk of cemental leaks into the spinal canal. CONCLUSION The recommendations are based on low-to-moderate quality of evidence or professional consensus as well as patient preferences and positive and harmful effects of the intervention.

However, the mechanism for this depletion remains unclear. To identify mechanisms of HIV-1-mediated CD4 T-cell death, two similar viral isolates obtained from a rapid progressor patient with significantly different pathogenic phenotypes were studied. One isolate (R3A) demonstrates enhanced pathogenesis in both in vivo models and relevant ex vivo lymphoid organ model systems compared to another isolate, R3B. The pathogenic determinants were previously mapped to the V5-gp41 envelope region, correlating functionally with enhanced fusion activity and elevated CXCR4 binding affinity. To further elucidate specific differences between R3A and R3B within the V5-gp41 domains that enhance CD4 depletion, R3A-R3B chimeras to study the V5-gp41 region were developed. Our data demonstrate that six residues in the ectodomain of R3A provide the major determinant for both enhanced Env-cell fusion and pathogenicity. Furthermore, three amino acid differences in the heptad repeat 2 (HR-2) domain of R3A determined its fusion activity and significantly elevated its pathogenic activity. The chimeric viruses with enhanced fusion activity, but not elevated CXCR4 affinity, correlated with high pathogenicity in the thymus organ. We conclude that the functional domain of a highly pathogenic HIV-1 Env is determined by mutations in the HR-2 region that contribute to enhanced fusion and CD4 T-cell depletion.","Sivaraman, Vijay; Zhang, Liguo; Meissner, Eric G; Jeffrey, Jerry L; Su, Lishan",Journal of virology,76,28

CASE PRESENTATION A 26-year-old man diagnosed with Bochdalek hernia was managed through combined abdominal and thoracic endoscopic surgery. On laparoscopy, the omentum prolapsed into the left thoracic cavity through the posterolateral area of the left diaphragm. On thoracoscopy, no adhesions of the omentum were seen in the thoracic cavity. The omentum was drawn back to the abdominal cavity, and a 4 × 3-cm hernial orifice was identified. The hernia orifice was repaired through simple closure with sutures laparoscopically. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful with no recurrences within the first year post-surgery.

FNL in this population can be challenging due to movement, floppy supraglottic structures, or secretions. Laryngeal ultrasound (LUS) may be an alternative, less invasive means of evaluating VFMI that also decreases aerosolization during the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary objective was to examine LUS interpretation proficiency for VFMI via an educational module. A secondary outcome was to determine whether quantitative measurements increase interpretation accuracy. STUDY DESIGN Prospective cohort trial. METHODS Medical students, residents, fellows, faculty, and staff were recruited to complete the module, composed of a 13-minute teaching video followed by 20 cases. Participants determined both qualitatively (subjective assessment) and then quantitatively (through protractor measurements of the vocal fold to arytenoid angle) whether there was normal versus impaired vocal fold mobility. RESULTS Thirty participants completed the LUS training module, and about one-third were otolaryngology residents. On average, each participant correctly identified 18 cases. The mean rank percent correct for quantitative measurements was significantly higher than that of qualitative interpretations (P < .0001). Measurements significantly caused participants to change their answer correctly compared to incorrectly (P < .0001). As the module progressed, there was no significant trend of more correct interpretations (P = .30). The sensitivity was higher for quantitative interpretations (89.0% vs. 87.3%) but specificity remained unchanged (92.6%). CONCLUSION Quantitative measurements may increase LUS interpretation accuracy. There was not a specific number of cases interpreted to achieve learning proficiency.

If current trends continue, more than 1.1 billion individuals will have obesity in 2030, corresponding to almost 2.5 times the number of adults currently living with diabetes. There is a strong interest in developing obesity treatments based on glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonism, which have proved to limit morbidity and mortality in type 2 diabetes.Areas covered: This review provides an overview of current compounds containing GLP-1 receptor agonism in clinical development for obesity, with mono-activity at the GLP-1 receptor (PF-0688296, glutazumab, semaglutide) or engaging one or more other endogenous hormonal systems involved in energy balance and metabolism, including glucagon, oxyntomodulin, glucose-dependent inhibitory peptide and amylin (CT-868, CT-388, AMG 133, tirzepatide, NNC9204-1177, JNJ-54728518, SAR425899, pegapamodutide, MK8521, cotadutide, efinopegdutide, BI-456906, cagrilintide + semaglutide 2,4 mg, HM15211, NNC9204-1706).Expert opinion: Many novel compounds employing GLP-1 receptor agonism are in clinical development.

The establishment of a precise balance between the pro- and anti-inflammatory responses is critical to guarantee control of the parasite and survival of the host. IL-10, a key regulatory cytokine produced by many cells of the immune system, has been shown to protect mice against pathology during acute Plasmodium0 chabaudi chabaudi AS model of malaria. However, the critical cellular source of IL-10 is still unknown. In this article, we demonstrate that T cell-derived IL-10 is necessary for the control of pathology during acute malaria, as mice bearing specific deletion of Il10 in T cells fully reproduce the phenotype observed in Il10(-)(/)(-) mice, with significant weight loss, decline in temperature, and increased mortality. Furthermore, we show that IFN-γ(+) Th1 cells are the main producers of IL-10 throughout acute infection, expressing high levels of CD44 and ICOS, and low levels of CD127. Although Foxp3(+) regulatory CD4(+) T cells produce IL-10 during infection, highly activated IFN-γ(+) Th1 cells were shown to be the essential and sufficient source of IL-10 to guarantee protection against severe immune-mediated pathology. Finally, in this model of malaria, we demonstrate that the generation of protective IL10(+)IFN-γ(+) Th1 cells is dependent on IL-27 signaling and independent of IL-21.","Freitas do Rosário, Ana Paula; Lamb, Tracey; Spence, Philip; Stephens, Robin; Lang, Agathe; Roers, Axel; Muller, Werner; O'Garra, Anne; Langhorne, Jean",Journal of immunology,76,1

A Collaborative Case Study of an Under Graduate AR Tourist Guide Project.,18.43224,1.4288782,2021-06-04,"BACKGROUND Laparoscopy is a surgical approach recommended for the treatment of gall bladder disease. It is recommended also in geriatric patients. Recently Single Incision Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy (SILC) has been proposed to minimize surgical trauma, recovery and hospitalization time. However, the results and advantages of SILC in the geriatric population have received minimal attention. This case series review is focused on the results of SILC in the geriatric population. METHODS The records of 355 patients who had undergone SILC were reviewed. This report identifies, in the entire cohort, 40 patients aged 65 years or older at the time of surgery who will be the object of this study (geriatric series). Clinical outcomes and results were evaluated. Moreover, post-operative pain of the geriatric cohort was compared to that of the entire series. RESULTS SILC was successfully completed for 347 out of 355 patients of the entire series, with no mortality reported. In total SILC was converted to standard laparoscopy in 10 patients (2.2%) but never to open procedure. No significant difference was found between the total cohort and the geriatric series in terms of median time of operation (61.20 min vs 68.38 min). Post-operative pain was significantly lower in geriatric patients. CONCLUSION SILC is an effective and safe procedure for the treatment of gallbladder disease of elderly, also in terms of post-operative pain and it represents an alternative to the standard laparoscopic approach on a routine basis.","Rizzuto, Antonia; Serra, Raffaele; Mignogna, Chiara; Palaia, Ilaria; Zittel, Franz Ulrich; Sacco, Rosario",International journal of surgery,76,19

Repair materials are usually porous, through which cells infiltrate, proliferate and secrete ECM. Their efficacy relies on good tissue integration and resolution of host defence mechanisms. Therefore, understanding the dynamics by which biomaterials interact with tissue will provide knowledge to advance prosthesis design. Furthermore, determining host response in real time would provide significant advantage both clinically and scientifically over the current terminal process of histology. METHODS 3 materials comprising synthetic and composite (synthetic materials hybridised with a resorbable biologic component) meshes were implanted into a rat full-thickness abdominal wall excision model. Their efficacy was evaluated using histopathology whilst also monitoring systemic concentrations of cytokines associated with inflammation and wound healing to predict material outcome over 12 weeks. RESULTS The noncomposite material (polyester) and Material B (polypropylene mesh with oligocaprone film and polydioxanone glue) stimulated the largest degree of adhesion from the 3 materials tested, although after 28 days adhesions were stronger to Material B. Histologically, all 3 materials integrated well with abdominal musculature and infiltrated completely with cells. CONCLUSIONS Analysis of systemic inflammation biomarkers confirmed inflammation elicited by surgeries and meshes irrespective of their composition. However, at an early postoperative endpoint (i.e., 1 week), some biomarkers, namely, IL-18 and RANTES, appeared to discriminate the noncomposite mesh from the composite materials, although in this study all materials successfully repaired the defects without recurrence or external indicators of postoperative chronic pain.","Bryan, Nicholas; Ashwin, Helen; Smart, Neil; Weyhe, Dirk; Wohlert, Stephen; Bayon, Yves; Hunt, John A",The International journal of artificial organs,76,8

In a blocking ELISA, pre-incubation of FG cell membrane proteins with the specific antiserum developed against the 27.8 kDa protein could block LCDV binding. Similarly, antiserum against 27.8 kDa protein could also inhibit LCDV infection of FG cells in vitro. Mass spectrometric analysis established that the 27.8 kDa protein and beta-actin had a strong association. These results strongly supported the possibility that the 27.8 kDa protein was the putative receptor specific for LCDV infection of FG cells.","Wang, Mu; Sheng, Xiu-Zhen; Xing, Jing; Tang, Xiao-Qian; Zhan, Wen-Bin",Diseases of aquatic organisms,76,1

The purpose of this study was to test the effectiveness of an intervention aimed at reducing anxiety and distress in DCGs of patients with cancer. METHODS This randomized controlled trial enrolled DCGs of patients with all cancer types who were being seen monthly by oncologists in outpatient clinics. There were three arms of the intervention delivered over a 4-month period: arm 1 (a) received 4 monthly videoconference-tailored coaching sessions with an advanced practice nurse or social worker focused on information and support, (b) participated in patient's appointments with the oncologist via videoconference over the 4-month study period, and (c) had access to a website designed for DCGs. Arm 2 did not receive the coaching sessions but received the other two components, and arm 3 received access to the DCG website only. RESULTS There were 302 DCGs who provided pre- and postintervention data. There were significant anxiety by group (P = .028 and r = 0.16) and distress by group interactions (P = .014 and r = 0.17). Arm 1 had the greatest percentage of DCGs who demonstrated improvement in anxiety (18.6%) and distress (25.2%). CONCLUSION Coaching and use of videoconference technology (to join the DCG into the patient-oncologist office visit) were effective in reducing both anxiety and distress for DCGs. These components could be considered for local CGs who-with COVID-19-are unable to accompany the patient to oncologist visits.","Douglas, Sara L; Mazanec, Polly; Lipson, Amy R; Day, Kim; Blackstone, Eric; Bajor, David L; Saltzman, Joel; Krishnamurthi, Smitha",JCO oncology practice,76,12

""Dark nudges"" aim to change consumer behavior against their best interests. ""Sludge"" uses cognitive biases to make behavior change more difficult. We have identified dark nudges and sludge in alcohol industry corporate social responsibility (CSR) materials. These undermine the information on alcohol harms that they disseminate, and may normalize or encourage alcohol consumption. Policymakers and practitioners should be aware of how dark nudges and sludge are used by the alcohol industry to promote misinformation about alcohol harms to the public. CONTEXT ""Nudges"" and other behavioral economic approaches exploit common cognitive biases (systematic errors in thought processes) in order to influence behavior and decision-making. Nudges that encourage the consumption of harmful products (for example, by exploiting gamblers' cognitive biases) have been termed ""dark nudges."" The term ""sludge"" has also been used to describe strategies that utilize cognitive biases to make behavior change harder. This study aimed to identify whether dark nudges and sludge are used by alcohol industry (AI)-funded corporate social responsibility (CSR) organizations, and, if so, to determine how they align with existing nudge conceptual frameworks. This information would aid their identification and mitigation by policymakers, researchers, and civil society. METHODS We systematically searched websites and materials of AI CSR organizations (e.g., IARD, Drinkaware, Drinkwise, Éduc'alcool); examples were coded by independent raters and categorized for further analysis. FINDINGS Dark nudges appear to be used in AI communications about ""responsible drinking."" The approaches include social norming (telling consumers that ""most people"" are drinking) and priming drinkers by offering verbal and pictorial cues to drink, while simultaneously appearing to warn about alcohol harms. Sludge, such as the use of particular fonts, colors, and design layouts, appears to use cognitive biases to make health-related information about the harms of alcohol difficult to access, and enhances exposure to misinformation. Nudge-type mechanisms also underlie AI mixed messages, in particular alternative causation arguments, which propose nonalcohol causes of alcohol harms. CONCLUSIONS Alcohol industry CSR bodies use dark nudges and sludge, which utilize consumers' cognitive biases to promote mixed messages about alcohol harms and to undermine scientific evidence. Policymakers, practitioners, and the public need to be aware of how such techniques are used to nudge consumers toward industry misinformation. The revised typology presented in this article may help with the identification and further analysis of dark nudges and sludge.","Petticrew, Mark; Maani, Nason; Pettigrew, Luisa; Rutter, Harry; VAN Schalkwyk, May Ci",The Milbank quarterly,76,11

When activated, Arfs associate with membranes where they regulate numerous steps of membrane homeostasis. The requirement for GBF1 implies that Arfs are important for replication, but which of the different Arfs function(s) during replication remains poorly understood. Here, we established cell lines expressing each of the human Arfs fused to a fluorescent tag and investigated their behavior during enterovirus infection. Arf1 was the first to be recruited to the replication organelles where it strongly co-localized with the viral antigen 2B and mature virions, but not dsRNA. By the end of the infectious cycle, Arf3, 4, 5 and 6 were also concentrated on the replication organelles. Once on the replication membranes, all Arfs except Arf3 were no longer sensitive to inhibition of GBF1, suggesting that in infected cells they do not actively cycle between GTP- and GDP-bound states. Only the depletion of Arf1, but not other class 1 and 2 Arfs significantly increased the sensitivity of replication to GBF1 inhibition. Surprisingly, depletion of Arf6, a class 3 Arf, normally implicated in plasma membrane events, also increased the sensitivity to GBF1 inhibition. Together, our results suggest that GBF1-dependent Arf1 activation directly supports the development and/or functioning of the replication complexes and that Arf6 plays a previously unappreciated role in viral replication. Our data reveal a complex pattern of Arf activation in enterovirus-infected cells, which may contribute to the resilience of viral replication in different cellular environments.IMPORTANCE Enteroviruses include many known and emerging pathogens such as poliovirus, enteroviruses 71 and D68, and others. Yet, licensed vaccines are available only against poliovirus and enterovirus 71, and specific anti-enterovirus therapeutics are lacking. Enterovirus infection induces the massive remodeling of intracellular membranes and the development of specialized domains harboring viral replication complexes, replication organelles. Here we investigated the roles of small Arf GTPases during enterovirus infection. Arfs control distinct steps in intracellular membrane traffic, and one of the Arf-activating proteins, GBF1, is a cellular factor required for enterovirus replication. We found that all Arfs expressed in human cells, including Arf6 normally associated with the plasma membrane, are recruited to the replication organelles and that Arf1 appears to be the most important Arf for enterovirus replication. These results document the rewiring of the cellular membrane pathways in infected cells and may provide new ways of controlling enterovirus infections.","Moghimi, Seyedehmahsa; Viktorova, Ekaterina; Zimina, Anna; Szul, Tomasz; Sztul, Elizabeth; Belov, George A",Journal of virology,76,27

Here, we present a microstructural analysis of AlxGa1-xN/Ge samples with 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, and a nominal doping level in the range of 1020 cm-3, together with the measurement of Ge concentration and its spatial distribution down to the nanometer scale. AlxGa1-xN/Ge samples with x ≤ 0.2 do not present any sign of inhomogeneity. However, samples with x > 0.4 display μm-size Ge crystallites at the surface. Ge segregation is not restricted to the surface: Ge-rich regions with a size of tens of nanometers are observed inside the AlxGa1-xN/Ge layers, generally associated with Ga-rich regions around structural defects. With these local exceptions, the AlxGa1-xN/Ge matrix presents a homogeneous Ge composition which can be significantly lower than the nominal doping level. Precise measurements of Ge in the matrix provide a view of the solubility diagram of Ge in AlxGa1-xN as a function of the Al mole fraction. The solubility of Ge in AlN is extremely low. Between AlN and GaN, the solubility increases linearly with the Ga mole fraction in the ternary alloy, which suggests that the Ge incorporation takes place by substitution of Ga atoms only. The maximum percentage of Ga sites occupied by Ge saturates around 1%. The solubility issues and Ge segregation phenomena at different length scales likely play a role in the efficiency of Ge as an n-type AlGaN dopant, even at Al concentrations where Ge DX centers are not expected to manifest. Therefore, this information can have direct impact on the performance of Ge-doped AlGaN light-emitting diodes, particularly in the spectral range for disinfection (≈260 nm), which requires heavily doped alloys with a high Al mole fraction.","Bougerol, Catherine; Robin, Eric; Di Russo, Enrico; Bellet-Amalric, Edith; Grenier, Vincent; Ajay, Akhil; Rigutti, Lorenzo; Monroy, Eva",ACS applied materials & interfaces,76,7

As the US population shifts to practice social distancing, there are undoubtedly changes in the pattern of traumatic injuries presenting to Emergency Departments across the US. This analysis aims to analyze previously undocumented trends on how the COVID-19 pandemic has changed the pattern of vehicle related injuries in selected US states. METHODS A retrospective analysis was performed utilizing public vehicle collision data gathered from the Department of Transportation of Florida, New York, and Massachusetts from October 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020 regarding 158,341 motor vehicle collisions. Descriptive statistical analysis and linear regression was performed to investigate the counts and trends of motor vehicle collisions and injuries during the study period in order to determine what effect, if any, COVID-19 has had on the incidence and pattern of these events. RESULTS In Florida, New York, and Massachusetts, there was a general downward trend of vehicle collisions and vehicle related injuries over this time period, with statistically significant association between number of total vehicle collisions vs. date (p < 0.001), as well as number of vehicle related injuries vs. date (p < 0.001).

While most coronaviruses are responsible for mild respiratory infections, they have been demonstrated to be neuroinvasive and neurotropic for over three decades. In this review, we assess whether SARS-CoV-2 follows this trend and if the neuroinvasive potential of this novel coronavirus is worthy of further investigation. METHODS To obtain sources for this study, we performed an online search through Pubmed, Researchgate and Google Scholar, finding 537 articles. After analysing them according to PRISMA, we included 14 in this review. DISCUSSION Data regarding neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 is scarce and mostly inconsistent. There are however identifiable trends which might provide a basis for future research. There is strong evidence that this novel coronavirus may be neuroinvasive and could cause a wide array of neurological symptoms and complications. Cerebrospinal fluid testing may shed more light on the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 in the central nervous system. Clarification of the respiratory failure mechanisms requires post mortem examinations and brain tissue analysis, and further research is of the utmost importance.

The risk of embolic cerebrovascular event complicates the management of this condition via a pure endovascular approach. A combined operative-endovascular intervention may be a valuable approach in order to reduce the risk of intraoperative stroke and prevent future embolic events. CASE PRESENTATION An 84-year-old female presented at the emergency department (ED) with a 4-month history of migratory digital cyanotic lesions across various fingers on her right hand. The lesion eventually progressed into dry gangrene on her right middle finger. Selective angiography of the aortic arch vessels demonstrated significant atherosclerotic plaque burden throughout her supra-aortic vessels and a segmental stenosis at the proximal innominate artery. A right carotid cut down was performed to allow clamping of the carotid artery so as to minimize the risk of intraoperative stroke from plaque manipulation. Retrograde balloon angioplasty was performed, and stent was placed across the stenotic segment. The patient tolerated the procedure well and had an uneventful postoperative course. She was discharged on postoperative day 3. At 2-week follow-up, she has had no progression of her digital ischemia nor other focal cranial nerve deficits. CONCLUSION Migratory digital ischemia is a rare presentation of atherosclerotic disease of the supra-aortic vessels. It represents a challenging situation for endovascular intervention due to concern about plaque dislodgment during the procedure. A retrograde balloon-stent angioplasty following distal carotid control with an open approach may be safe and effective in selected patients.","Juo, Yen-Yi; Ramirez, Lisbi Rivas; Ruben, Garry",Vascular and endovascular surgery,76,15

The VIGILANCE (VItal siGns monItoring with continuous puLse oximetry And wireless cliNiCian notification aftEr surgery) study was a randomized controlled trial (n=2049) designed to assess the impact of continuous vital sign monitoring with alerts sent to nursing staff when respiratory resuscitations with naloxone, code blues, and intensive care unit transfers occurred in a cohort of postsurgical patients in a ward setting. This report identifies and evaluates key issues and challenges associated with introducing wireless monitoring systems into complex hospital infrastructure during the VIGILANCE eHealth intervention implementation. Potential solutions and suggestions for future implementation research are presented. OBJECTIVE The goals of this study were to: (1) identify issues related to the deployment of the eHealth intervention system of the VIGILANCE study; and (2) evaluate the influence of these issues on intervention adoption. METHODS During the VIGILANCE study, issues affecting the implementation of the eHealth intervention were documented on case report forms, alarm event forms, and a nursing user feedback questionnaire. These data were collated by the research and nursing personnel and submitted to the research coordinator. In this evaluation report, the clinical adoption framework was used as a guide to organize the identified issues and evaluate their impact. RESULTS Using the clinical adoption framework, we identified issues within the framework dimensions of people, organization, and implementation at the meso level, as well as standards and funding issues at the macro level. Key issues included: nursing workflow changes with blank alarm forms (24/1030, 2.33%) and missing alarm forms (236/1030, 22.91%), patient withdrawal (110/1030, 10.68%), wireless network connectivity, false alarms (318/1030, 30.87%), monitor malfunction (36/1030, 3.49%), probe issues (16/1030, 1.55%), and wireless network standards. At the micro level, these issues affected the quality of the service in terms of support provided, the quality of the information yielded by the monitors, and the functionality, reliability, and performance of the monitoring system. As a result, these issues impacted access through the decreased ability of nurses to make complete use of the monitors, impacted care quality of the trial intervention through decreased effectiveness, and impacted productivity through interference in the coordination of care, thus decreasing clinical adoption of the monitoring system. CONCLUSIONS Patient monitoring with eHealth technology in surgical wards has the potential to improve patient outcomes. However, proper planning that includes engagement of front-line nurses, installation of appropriate wireless network infrastructure, and use of comfortable cableless devices is required to maximize the potential of eHealth monitoring.

Here, we synthesized Au-Cu2Se core-shell nanoparticles with different shell thicknesses by controlling the precursor concentration in solution. The Au-Cu2Se core-shell nanoparticles are about 37-53 nm in size, and the cores of the nanostructures are composed of Au nanoparticles with sizes of ~11 nm. The effect of shell thickness on the thermoelectric properties of core-shell nanocomposites is investigated after sintering the core-shell nanoparticles into pellets using the spark plasma sintering (SPS) technique. The power factor was optimized by synergetic effect of the improvement of Seebeck coefficient by energy filtering in the Au/Cu2Se interface and the effective tuning of carrier concentration by Ohmic contact in the interface. The lattice thermal conductivity of core-shell nanocomposites is reduced by coherent phonon scattering, which is caused by the wave-like interference of phonons due to the phase shift in the core-shell interface. The highest ZT value of 0.61 is obtained at 723 K for Au-Cu2Se core-shell nanocomposites with a shell thickness of 21 nm, which is higher than that of pure Cu2Se nanocomposite or a mixture of Au and Cu2Se particles.","Jin, Yingshi; Hwang, Junphil; Han, Mi-Kyung; Son, WonHyuk; Rhyee, Jong-Soo; Kim, Sung-Jin",ACS applied materials & interfaces,76,1

Glucose is the dominant energy source for the brain. However, little is known about how glucose metabolism impacts the coordination of network activity in the brain in healthy adults. What is the main finding and its importance? We demonstrate that both alpha oscillations and the aperiodic signal components of resting electroencephalography are both modulated by experimentally elevated blood glucose levels. Our findings suggest that glucose increases measures associated with excitation-inhibition (E:I) balance, but that the effect on alpha oscillations may plateau at a certain level. Understanding the relationship between glucose consumption and E:I balance is critical to developing our understanding of how metabolism shapes human brain activity. ABSTRACT Brain network oscillations can broadly be divided into periodic and aperiodic signal components which are sensitive to state-dependent changes in network coordination and excitation to inhibition (E:I) balance. We sought to address whether the brain's dominant energy source, glucose, is implicated in regulating network activity and excitability. We conducted an experimenter-blind, crossover study of the effect of blood glucose level (BGL) on the resting electroencephalography (EEG) frequency spectrum. Participants consumed a glucose drink (75 g glucose) or an equivalent volume of water on two separate visits. EEG data were sampled before and up to three hours after the drink. We found the experimentally induced changes in BGL exhibited an inverted u-shaped relationship with changes in the individual alpha frequency peak, whereas the slope of the aperiodic signal component of the frequency spectrum showed a positive linear association suggestive of greater excitation. By contrast, peak alpha power-typically associated with top-down inhibitory processes-was negatively associated with changes in BGL. Collectively these results suggest that high BGL alters brain network coordination in the form of alpha oscillations and measures associated with E:I balance. This article is protected by copyright.

Furthermore, airway management ranges from spontaneous breathing to oro or nasotracheal intubation. Case reports have described the use of laryngeal masks (LMs) previously; however, its safety compared to tracheal intubation has not been assessed.We conducted a retrospective analysis of 30 patients that underwent awake craniotomy for tumor surgery to compare the feasibility and safety of different airway management strategies. Nasal fiberoptic intubation (FOI) was performed in 21 patients while 9 patients received LM for airway management. Ventilation, critical events, and perioperative complications were evaluated.Cannot intubate situation occurred in 4 cases reinserting the tube after awake phase, while no difficulties were described reinserting the LM (P < .0001). Furthermore, duration of mechanical ventilation after tumor removal was significantly lower in the LM group compared to FOI group (62 ± 24 vs. 339 ± 82 [min] mean ± sem, P < .0001). Postoperatively, 2 patients in each group were diagnosed with and treated for respiratory complications including pneumonia, without statistical significance between groups.In summary, LM is a feasible airway management method for patients undergoing awake craniotomy, resulting in reduced ventilation duration compared to FOI procedure.","Grabert, Josefin; Klaschik, Sven; Güresir, Ági; Jakobs, Patrick; Soehle, Martin; Vatter, Hartmut; Hilbert, Tobias; Güresir, Erdem; Velten, Markus",Medicine,76,5

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between prehospitalization immunosuppressants use (exposure), and COVID-19 patient outcomes. Methods: We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study using a nationwide healthcare claims database of South Korea as of May 15, 2020. Confirmed COVID-19 infection in hospitalized individuals aged 40 years or older were included for analysis. We defined exposure variable by using inpatient and outpatient prescription records of immunosuppressants from the database. Our primary outcome was a composite endpoint of all-cause death, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mechanical ventilation use. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW)-adjusted logistic regression analyses were used, to estimate odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals, comparing immunosuppressants users and non-users. Findings: We identified 4,349 patients, for which 1,356 were immunosuppressants users and 2,903 were non-users. Patients who used immunosuppressants were at increased odds of the primary outcome of all-cause death, ICU admission and mechanical ventilation use (IPTW OR 1.32; 95% CI: 1.06 - 1.63).

SV in older adults remains neglected in research, policies and practices. Valid SV prevalence estimates and associated risk factors in older adults are currently unavailable. Objective: To measure lifetime and past 12-months sexual victimisation in older adults living in Belgium, its correlates, assailant characteristics and the way that victims framed their SV experiences. Design: Cross-sectional general population study. Setting: Community-dwelling, assisted living and nursing homes. Participants: 513 people of 70 years and older living in Belgium. Methods: SV was measured using behaviourally specific questions based on a broad definition of SV. Participants were selected via a cluster random probability sampling with a random route finding approach. Information on sexual victimisation, correlates, assailant characteristics and framing was collected via structured face-to-face interviews. Results: Lifetime SV prevalence was 44% (55% F, 29% M). Past 12-months prevalence was 8% (9% F, 8% M). Female sex and a higher number of sexual partners were associated with lifetime SV (p <.05), non-heterosexual sexual orientation with past 12-months SV (p <.05). Correlates generally linked to elder abuse and neglect were not linked with SV. 'Someone unknown ' was identified as most common assailant. Conclusions: SV appears to be common in older adults in Belgium. Both correlates and assailant characteristics seem to differ from previous studies on elder abuse and neglect. Recognising older adults as a risk group for sexual victimisation in research, policies and practices is of the utmost importance.","Nobels, A.; Inescu, A.

It seriously interferes with the normal production activities during the outbreak. Therefore, it is of great significance to study its transmission mechanism and the future development trend. In this paper, the SEIR model of new coronavirus was established, and the value assignment method and least square method were used to solve the model. The fitting results and the real value had a good match, indicating that the model was more reasonable. The epidemic data of Wuhan, Guangdong and Brazil were analyzed and predicted respectively. The analysis found that the epidemic situation in Wuhan was basically stable;the epidemic situation in Guangdong was relatively late, and the control was relatively timely. The epidemic situation in Brazil started in the middle of March, so the mortality rate continued to rise from March to April, but the cure rate remained low. The epidemic prevention and control suggestions were put forward to Wuhan, Guangdong and Brazil respectively. The theoretical analysis of the model shows that prevention and control isolation and medical tracking isolation play an important role in inhibiting the large-scale spread of the epidemic. In addition, individuals improve their awareness of prevention and take strict self-protection measures to curb the increase in the number of infected people.

Clinical characteristics of delta (B.1.617.2) VOC are not well reported. To compare demographic, clinical and laboratory features and outcomes in the second Covid-19 wave in India (delta VOC) with the previous wave we performed a registry-based study. Methods: Successive SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed Covid-19 patients presenting to our Advanced Covid Care hospital were prospectively recruited. In the first phase (wave) from March-December 2020, 1395 of 7476 (18.7%) suspected patients tested positive and 863 (61.89%) hospitalized, while in second wave from January-July 2021 out of 1641 confirmed cases out of 8680 (19.4%) suspected 388 (23.6%) were hospitalized. Details of clinical and laboratory features at admission to hospital, management and outcomes in the two waves have been compared. Results: In both cohorts, majority were men and 20% less than 40 years. Prevalence of hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases was more than 20%. Second wave patients had similar pre-hospitalization symptom duration but had significantly greater cough, fever and shortness of breath and lower SpO2 at presentation with greater lymphopenia, C-reactive proteins, interleukin-6, ferritin, lactic dehydrogenase and transaminases.

By a simple extension to the force-based model, we implement the following preventive measures currently taken by supermarkets;social distancing and one-way systems, and different customer habits, assessing them based on the average individual disease exposure and the time taken to complete shopping (shopping efficiency). Results show that maintaining social distance is an effective way to reduce exposure, but at the cost of shopping efficiency. We find that the one-way system is the optimal strategy for reducing exposure while minimizing the impact on shopping efficiency. Customers should also visit supermarkets less frequently, but buy more when they do, if they wish to minimize their exposure.

Firms experienced extraordinary pressure and struggled to minimize the immediate and long-term impact of supply chains disruptions. Applying chaos theory, this study employs a single-case method to understand the disruptions to the business-to-business oil and gas supply chain. We make three major contributions. First, we examine firm decision-making during significant disruptions. Second, we use chaos theory to better understand the decision-making process. Finally, we develop a framework to explicate the decision-making process and provide guidelines for decision-making during disruptions. Our findings provide theoretical insights and have important implications for practitioners addressing supply chain disruptions during crises.","Kumar, Bipul Sharma Arun",Industrial Marketing Management,76,8

Computing is performed with power hungry processors whose performance is ultimately limited by the data transfer to and from memory. Optics is one of the powerful means of communicating and processing information and there is intense current interest in optical information processing for realizing high-speed computations. Here we present and experimentally demonstrate an optical computing framework based on spatiotemporal effects in multimode fibers for a range of learning tasks from classifying COVID-19 X-ray lung images and speech recognition to predicting age from face images. The presented framework overcomes the energy scaling problem of existing systems without compromising speed. We leveraged simultaneous, linear, and nonlinear interaction of spatial modes as a computation engine. We numerically and experimentally showed the ability of the method to execute several different tasks with accuracy comparable to a digital implementation.","Teugin, Uugur; Yildirim, Mustafa; Ouguz, .Ilker; Moser, Christophe; Psaltis, Demetri",,76,4

Every year, users contribute thousands of reports that include reference to infectious diseases and toxins, and these reports are then distributed to all subscribers of ProMED. However, the corpus of reports has not been well studied so far. Thus, we propose to apply text mining methods to derive information pertinent to the characterisation of the stage of an epidemic outbreak from the reports. MethodsA retrospective study was conducted in ProMED reports in three steps: reports filtering, keywords extraction from reports and finally word co-occurrence network analysis. The keyword extraction was performed with the TextRank algorithm, keywords co-occurrence networks were then produced using the top keywords from each document and multiple network centrality measures were computed to analyse the co-occurrence networks. We used two major outbreaks in recent years, Ebola 2014 and Zika 2015, as cases to illustrate and validate the process. ResultsWe found that the information structures extracted at different stages of outbreaks from ProMED are consistent with response strategies as well as situation reports of the World Health Organisation. ConclusionThis study shows that ProMED provides large valuable information to characterise the evolution of epidemic outbreaks. Our research presents a pipeline that can extract and organise this information in a meaningful way. It also highlights the potential for ProMED mail to be utilised in monitoring, evaluating and improving responses to outbreaks.","You, Jingxian; Expert, Paul; Costelloe, Ceire",,76,22

Named the Epizootic Rabbit Enteropathy (ERE), this digestive syndrome has become the main cause of mortality in rabbit farming. The diagnosis in field conditions is difficult because co-infection with other common rabbit pathogens is frequent. By using specific pathogenic free (SPF) rabbits and starting from a field sample of intestinal contents of diseased animals, a virulent material (inoculum) was obtained free of almost all known pathogens but reproduced the symptoms and lesions of ERE. Four hundred and seven SPF rabbits were used in five trials to describe the disease. ERE is characterized by a high contagiousness, 30 to 40% mortality in a few days and about 100% morbidity whatever the dose of the inoculum used. Clinical signs and lesions evolved acutely with the first sign (rambling noise) appearing one day after inoculation and the disease peaking 4 to 6 days later. Growth was strongly lowered from the second day to the end of the second week. Rambling noise and distended abdomen were frequent, mucus excretion and cecal impaction were frequent but not constant. ERE at necropsy was characterized by the absence of any inflammatory or congestive lesions on the gut or on other organs but with the typical presence of a stomach and/or duodenum dilated by liquid and gas and by the absence of specific histological lesions. The etiological agent has not been identified yet, but we demonstrate that the intestinal content was infectious as early as the second day. This work constitutes the experimental basis for studies on this emerging disease within the framework of etiological research led in different European laboratories working with the infectious material.","Licois, Dominique; Wyers, Monique; Coudert, Pierre",Veterinary research,76,1

More than 250 field samples were tested by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction using two sets of primers corresponding to the most conserved 3'-untranslated region and the most variable S1 gene region of the viral genome. Ninety-one IBV isolates were characterized by phylogenetic analysis of the S1 gene hypervariable region comprising 136 to 558 nucleotides. The major group of isolates (38 viruses) showed very close sequence relationship with strains of the Massachusetts genotype circulating in Russia since the early 1970s. The analysed region of the other 22 Russian IBVs was similar (from 89 to 98% identity) to that from the strains of European genotypes including D274 (nine isolates), 793/B (10 isolates), and B1648, 624/I and Italy-02 (one isolate in each group). Two isolates from very distant geographic locations in Russia (Far East and the European part) clustered together with Chinese strains of QXIBV genotype. None of the remaining 27 Russian isolates showed a close sequence relationship with known IBV strains available in sequence databases. The majority of these variant viruses clustered into the six novel Russian genotypes, often correlating with their geographic location. The remaining five of them were placed outside these unique groups, also representing new genotypes. These data for the first time demonstrated the high genetic diversity of IBV isolates circulating in Russia.","Bochkov, Yury A; Batchenko, Galina V; Shcherbakova, Lidiya O; Borisov, Alexander V; Drygin, Vladimir V",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,76,1

We report a case of acute massive hemoptysis due to aortobronchial fistula that was successfully controlled by a simple and rapid thick wedge resection of the lung with hematoma by using the black cartilage stapler. A 65-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with acute massive hemoptysis. After tracheal intubation, chest computed tomography revealed hematoma in the left lung and ruptured aortic dissection from the distal arch to the descending aorta. He was diagnosed with aortobronchial fistula and underwent an emergency surgery on the same day. We performed posterolateral thoracotomy. A dissecting aortic aneurysm (diameter, ~80 mm) with adhesion of the left upper lobe and the superior segment of the lower lobe was found. The lung parenchyma expanded with the hematoma. We stapled the upper and lower lobes by using the black cartridge stapler along the aortopulmonary window. Massive hemoptysis disappeared, and the complete aortic dissection appeared. Aortic dissection with adherent lung was excised, and graft replacement of the distal arch and descending thoracic aorta was performed. Proximal lung wedge resection using black cartridge stapler is a simple and quick method to control massive hemoptysis from aortic dissection; hence, this procedure is an effective option to control massive hemoptysis due to aortobronchial fistula. This technique could rapidly stop massive hemoptysis and prevent dissection of the adherent lung tissue and intra-thoracic bleeding.","Sakai, Mitsuaki; Ozawa, Yuichiro; Nakajima, Tomomi; Ikeda, Akihiko; Konishi, Taisuke; Matsuzaki, Kanji",Journal of thoracic disease,76,1

It associates with both viral genomic RNA and subgenomic mRNAs and has structural and non-structural roles in replication including viral RNA-dependent RNA transcription, genome replication, encapsidation and translation. These processes all involve RNA-protein interactions between the N protein and viral RNAs. To better understand the RNA-binding properties of this multifunctional protein, the N protein was expressed in Escherichia coli as a chimeric protein fused to glutathione-S-transferase (GST). Biochemical analyses of RNA-binding properties were performed on full-length and partial N protein segments to define the RNA-binding domain. The full-length N protein and the GST-N protein fusion product had similar binding activities with a dissociation constant (K(d)) of 14 nM when the MHV 5'-leader sequence was used as ligand. The smallest N protein fragment which retained RNA-binding activity was a 55 aa segment containing residues 177-231 which bound viral RNA with a K(d) of 32 nM. A consensus viral sequence recognized by the N protein was inferred from these studies; AAUCYAAAC was identified to be the potential minimum ligand for the N protein. Although the core UCYAA sequence is often tandemly repeated in viral genomes, ligands containing one or more repeats of UCYAA showed no difference in binding to the N protein. Together these data demonstrate a high-affinity, specific interaction between the N protein and a conserved RNA sequence present at the 5'-ends of MHV mRNA.","Nelson, G W; Stohlman, S A; Tahara, S M",The Journal of general virology,76,5

Cases Case 1: A 25 year old male presented with dyspnoea, cough and high fevers for 4 days. He was commenced on broad-spectrum antimicrobials and oxygen therapy. His respiratory function deteriorated in spite of these measures and he required mechanical ventilation. CT showed left upper lobe consolidation as well as multifocal ground-glass opacification. Case 2: A 43 year-old male presented with headache and was found incidentally to have pneumonia. He was recently diagnosed with pituitary apoplexy secondary to an adenoma with resultant pituitary insufficiency but MRI brain was stable. His respiratory function deteriorated in spite of antibiotics and he required mechanical ventilation. CT showed likely atypical infection with resultant ARDS. Outcome Both underwent nasopharyngeal RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2. Patient 2 was positive. Patient 1 was extubated and made a good recovery. Patient 2 was transferred to another centre for ECMO therapy. He died 27 days after transfer. Conclusion Given the atypical presentations in generally otherwise young and healthy individuals, the decision was made outside of national guidance to perform testing for SARS-CoV-2. This diagnosis had far-reaching implications for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic within Ireland.","Faller, E; Lapthorne, S; Barry, R; Shamile, F; Salleh, F; Doyle, D; O'Halloran, D; Prentice, M; Sadlier, C",Irish medical journal,76,30

Cytopathic expression of BCV infection of cultured cells depends on the viral strain and the cell type. BCV-induced cell fusion occurred under neutral or alkaline but not acidic conditions. Lysosomotropic bases did not significantly reduce virus yield, suggesting that productive BCV infection was not mediated by endocytosis but rather by direct fusion of the viral envelope with the plasma membrane. Trypsin cleavage of the 185 kDa S glycoprotein into 100 and 110 kDa subunits was required for cell fusion and productive infection of cultured BFS cells with the cell-adapted, avirulent strain BCV-L9. This strain has a wide host cell range in vitro while several wild-type, virulent strains were restricted to HRT-18 cells. Antigenic and genomic comparisons of the avirulent and virulent strains revealed corresponding differences. Some monoclonal antibodies against S reacted with both virulent and avirulent strains, while others reacted only with the avirulent strain BCV-L9. Nucleotide sequences of the S genes indicated that amino acid substitutions in cleavage sites, antigenic regions, and putative fusion domains occurred and differentiated BCV strains.","Storz, J; Zhang, X M",Behring Institute Mitteilungen,76,24

We aimed to identify optimal symptom combinations to capture most cases using fewer tests with implications for COVID-19 vaccine developers across different resource settings and public health. METHODS: UK and US users of the COVID-19 Symptom Study app who reported new-onset symptoms and an RT-PCR test within seven days of symptom onset were included. Sensitivity, specificity, and number of RT-PCR tests needed to identify one case (test per case [TPC]) were calculated for different symptom combinations. A multi-objective evolutionary algorithm was applied to generate combinations with optimal trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity. FINDINGS: UK and US cohorts included 122,305 (1,202 positives) and 3,162 (79 positive) individuals. Within three days of symptom onset, the COVID-19 specific symptom combination (cough, dyspnoea, fever, anosmia/ageusia) identified 69% of cases requiring 47 TPC. The combination with highest sensitivity (fatigue, anosmia/ageusia, cough, diarrhoea, headache, sore throat) identified 96% cases requiring 96 TPC.

However, basic questions about the conditions best suited for realizing mindful states remain unanswered. Prominent among these is whether a group mindfulness practice setting is more effective for novice meditators than a solitary practice setting. Answering this question has assumed new urgency due to the imposition of physical distancing measures designed to stop the spread of COVID-19. In a time of limited social contact, is a simulated group practice setting better than practicing alone? This preliminary study investigated whether environmental setting impacted mindfulness practice experience by examining the effects of three simulated meditation practice environments (1. group practice, 2. nature practice, and 3. solitary practice) on state mindfulness and perceived social connectivity in a sample of novice meditators. Significant differences emerged across the three simulated practice settings. Findings suggest watching others meditate while meditating appears to most effectively induce a state of mindfulness and strengthen feelings of social connectivity. This study supports traditional beliefs about the benefits of group mindfulness practice. These findings also have implications for social workers struggling to stretch limited resources to address growing mental health demands, especially during times of heightened social isolation due to COVID-19. If a simulated group practice confers the same cognitive benefits as solitary practice while also conferring social benefits, simulated group instruction may be preferable for therapeutic and economic reasons.","Hanley, Adam W; Dehili, Vincent; Krzanowski, Deidre; Barou, Daniela; Lecy, Natalie; Garland, Eric L",Clin Soc Work J,76,6

We posit that doing so requires our community to shift, from operational aspects taken in isolation to holistic analysis of datacenter resources, energy, and workloads. In turn, this shift will require new analysis methods, and open-access, FAIR datasets with fine temporal and spatial granularity. We leverage in this work one of the (rare) public datasets providing fine-grained information on datacenter operations. Using it, we show strong evidence that fine-grained information reveals new operational aspects. We then propose a method for holistic analysis of datacenter operations, providing statistical characterization of node, energy, and workload aspects. We demonstrate the benefits of our holistic analysis method by applying it to the operations of a datacenter infrastructure with over 300 nodes. Our analysis reveals both generic and ML-specific aspects, and further details how the operational behavior of the datacenter changed during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic.

Our analysis considered the COVID-19 incidence reported by the World Health Organization and the implementation date of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) reported by the Oxford COVID-19 government response tracker. RESULTS: In each of the seven included countries, in 2020, the average IPP was lower than before (p < 0.01), with the largest difference in IPP being 31.1% (95% confidence interval, 28.4%-33.7%). In Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, and South Africa, higher IPPs were observed during the epidemiological weeks 4-16 of 2020 compared to those in 2010-2019. The IPPs increased after NPIs were implemented in Argentina and South Africa but started to decline in Bolivia, Chile, Madagascar, and Paraguay before NPI implementation. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza burden and activity decreased during 2020 in the Southern hemisphere. The temporal declines in influenza activity varied among countries.","Kim, Jeehyun; Gómez, Raquel Elizabeth Gómez; Hong, Kwan; Yum, Sujin; Jang, Jieun; Chun, Byung Chul",Int. j. infect. dis,76,24

However, in the western USA, WNS-susceptible bat species rarely assemble in large numbers and known winter roosts are uncommon features. WNS increases arousal frequency and activity of infected bats during hibernation. Our objective was to explore the effectiveness of acoustic monitoring as a surveillance tool for WNS. We propose a non-invasive approach to model pre-WNS baseline activity rates for comparison with future acoustic data after WNS is suspected to occur. We investigated relationships among bat activity, ambient temperatures, and season prior to presence of WNS across forested sites of Montana, USA where WNS was not known to occur. We used acoustic monitors to collect bat activity and ambient temperature data year-round on 41 sites, 2011-2019. We detected a diverse bat community across managed (n = 4) and unmanaged (n = 37) forest sites and recorded over 5.37 million passes from bats, including 13 identified species. Bats were active year-round, but positive associations between average of the nightly temperatures by month and bat activity were strongest in spring and fall. From these data, we developed site-specific prediction models for bat activity to account for seasonal and annual temperature variation prior to known occurrence of WNS. These prediction models can be used to monitor changes in bat activity that may signal potential presence of WNS, such as greater than expected activity in winter, or less than expected activity during summer. We propose this model-based method for future monitoring efforts that could be used to trigger targeted sampling of individual bats or hibernacula for WNS, in areas where traditional disease surveillance approaches are logistically difficult to implement or because of human-wildlife transmission concerns from COVID-19.","Hicks, Lorin L; Schwab, Nathan A; Homyack, Jessica A; Jones, Jay E; Maxell, Bryce A; Burkholder, Braden O",PLoS One,76,1

Supportive supervision is a functional component of the immunization systems that allows identification of existing gaps, provides an opportunity for onsite training, and document real-time findings for improvement of the program. The control measures of COVID-19 pandemic have also resulted in limitation of operations of the immunization system including supportive supervision. This has limited many aspects of supportive supervision for surveillance and routine immunization monitoring system in the East and Southern African countries. The aim of this study is to identify the effects of COVID-19 on Integrated Supportive Supervision visits for expanded programme on immunization (EPI) and how it influences the immunization and vaccine preventable disease (VPD) surveillance indicators, and its short-term effect towards notification of increase or decrease morbidity and mortality. Methods: we reviewed the integrated supportive supervision (ISS) data and the routine administrative coverage from 19 countries in the East and Southern Africa (ESA) for the period January to August 2019 to analyze the trends in the number of visits, vaccine-preventable diseases (VPD), and routine immunization (RI) indicators using t-test, and compare with the period January to August 2020 during the months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: thirteen countries out of the 19 considered, had shown a decline in the number of integrated supportive supervision (ISS) visits, with 10 (77%) having more than 59% decrease during the January-August 2020 as compared to the same period 2019. Eleven (57%) of the countries have shown a decrease (p-value < 0.05). Ethiopia and Kenya had the highest drop (p-value < 0.000). Six (32%) had an increase in the number of visits, with Madagascar, Zambia, and Zimbabwe having >100% increase in the number of visits. Sixty-seven percent (67%) of the countries that have decreased in the number of ISS visits have equally witnessed a drop in DPT3 administrative coverage. Countries with a low proportion of outreach sessions conducted in the period of January - August 2020, have all had sessions interruption, with more than 40% of the reasons associated with the lockdown. Conclusion: countries have experienced a decrease in the number of supportive supervision visits conducted, during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic and, this has influenced the routine immunization and vaccine-preventable diseases surveillance (VPD) process indicators monitored through the conduct of the visits. Continuous decrease in these performance indicators pose a great threat to the performance sustained and the functionality of the surveillance and immunization system, and consequently on increased surveillance sensitivity to promptly detect outbreaks and aiming to reducing morbidity and mortality in the sub-region.","Bello, Isah Mohammed; Lebo, Emmaculate; Shibeshi, Messeret Eshetu; Akpan, Godwin Ubong; Chakauya, Jethro; Masresha, Balcha Girma; Daniel, Fussum",Pan Afr Med J,76,15

The present study takes a neural trait approach, examining whether the temporal dynamics of resting EEG networks are associated with inter-individual differences in prosociality. In two experimental sessions, we collected 55 healthy males' resting EEG, their self-reported prosocial concern and values, and their incentivized prosocial behavior across different reward domains (money, time) and social contexts (collective, individual). By means of EEG microstate analysis we identified the temporal coverage of four canonical resting networks (microstates A, B, C, and D) and their mutual communication in order to examine their association with an aggregated index of prosociality. Participants with a higher coverage of microstate A and more transitions from microstate C to A were more prosocial. Our study demonstrates that temporal dynamics of intrinsic brain networks can be linked to complex social behavior. On the basis of previous findings on links of microstate A with sensory processing, our findings suggest that participants with a tendency to engage in bottom-up processing during rest behave more prosocially than others.","Schiller, Bastian; Kleinert, Tobias; Teige-Mocigemba, Sarah; Klauer, Karl Christoph; Heinrichs, Markus",Sci Rep,76,1

Many hospitalized patients may continue testing COVID-19 positive even after the resolution of symptoms. Thus, a pressing concern for clinicians is the safety of discharging these asymptomatic patients if they have any remaining infectivity. This case report explores the viral viability in a patient with persistent COVID-19 over the course of a 2-month hospitalization. Positive nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected and isolated in the laboratory and analyzed by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reactions (qRT-PCR), and serology was tested for neutralizing antibodies throughout the hospitalization period. The patient experienced waning symptoms by hospital day 40 and had no viable virus growth by hospital day 41, suggesting no risk of infectivity, despite positive RT-PCR results which prolonged his hospital stay. Notably, this case showed infectivity for at least 24 days after disease onset, which is longer than the discontinuation of transmission-based precautions recommended by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Thus, our findings suggest that the timeline for discontinuing transmission-based precautions may need to be extended for patients with severe and prolonged COVID-19 disease. Additional large-scale studies are needed to draw definitive conclusions on the appropriate clinical management for these patients. â.","Wan, Xiu-Feng; Tang, Cynthia Y; Ritter, Detlef; Wang, Yang; Li, Tao; Segovia, Karen; Kosikova, Martina; Johnson, Marc; Kwon, Hyung J; Xie, Hang; Hammer, Richard D; McElroy, Jane A; Hamid, Aws; Collins, Natalie D; Hang, Jun; Camp, Simone",J Med Virol,76,30

However, the mucosal adjuvant for ASFV vaccination is poorly studied. Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands such as the FlaB flagellin from Vibrio vulniï¬cus and the heat shock protein 70 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (mHsp70) hold a great promise as novel vaccine adjuvant. However, the mucosal adjuvanticities of such TLR ligands have not been studied in pigs. In this study, three recombinant Adenovirus (rAd) vectors, namely rAd-F1, rAd-FlaB-F1 and rAd-F1-Hsp70, were constructed by fusing the FlaB or mHsp70 to ASFV CD2v-p30-p54 fusion antigen. Western blotting showed that the three fusion proteins expressed in rAd-infected cells reacted positively with ASFV antibodies. After intranasal immunization of pigs with the three rAd vectors, the antigen-specific IgG antibodies were detectable from day 7 after primary immunization, which were significantly boosted by the secondary immunization. Strong Th1/Th2 cytokine responses were detected in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Compared to immunization with the control rAd-F1, significantly higher levels of the antigen-specific IgA antibodies were detected in the nasal fluids, tracheal washes and lung lavages.1 Compared to immunization with rAd-Flab-F1, immunization with rAd-F1-Hsp70 induced significantly stronger mucosal IgA antibody response. Cytokine detection of the pig lung lavages showed that the elevated IgA antibody responses were correlated mainly with IL-4, IL-10 and IFN-&#945;, which were confirmed by the significantly increased antigen-recall cytokine expression in the porcine alveolar macrophages. These data suggest that mHsp70 has potent mucosal adjuvanticity in pigs, and the fusion rAd vector can be used for ASFV mucosal vaccine development.","Lu, Huipeng; Zhou, Xiaohui; Wu, Zhi; Zhang, Xinyu; Zhu, Liqi; Guo, Xiaoyu; Zhang, Quan; Zhu, Shanyuan; Zhu, Hongfei; Sun, Huaichang",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,76,16

To address this gap, we identify the extent to which parents and caregivers with pre-primary school-aged children were engaged in their children's learning during school closures in Ethiopia. Our focus on Ethiopia is of particular relevance given that ECE provision has expanded dramatically in recent years, aimed at ensuring children are prepared for primary school. Using data collected through a phone survey with 480 parents and caregivers, the results revealed that learning disruption due to COVID-19 school closures is likely to be substantial and will probably widen existing inequalities further. Many poorer households and those where parents or caregivers are not literate, are less likely to have child-oriented learning resources, and home learning activities between parents and children in these households are limited. The study highlights that greater attention needs to be paid to mitigate the threats of COVID-19 on Ethiopia's recent gains in ECE, to prevent the pandemic from further reinforcing inequalities between children from advantaged and disadvantaged households.","Kim, Janice H; Araya, Mesele; Hailu, Belay Hagos; Rose, Pauline M; Woldehanna, Tassew",Early Child Educ J,76,5

Several vaccines, conceived in 2020, that evoke protective spike antibody responses are being deployed in mass public health vaccination programs. Recent data suggests, however, that as sequence variation in the spike genome accumulates, some vaccines may lose efficacy. Methods: Using a macaque model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we tested the efficacy of a peptide-based vaccine targeting MHC class I epitopes on the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. We administered biodegradable microspheres with synthetic peptides and adjuvants to rhesus macaques. Unvaccinated control and vaccinated macaques were challenged with 1 × 108 TCID50 units of SARS-CoV-2, followed by assessment of clinical symptoms and viral load, chest radiographs, and sampling of peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid for downstream analysis. Results: Vaccinated animals were free of pneumonia-like infiltrates characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 infection and presented with lower viral loads relative to controls. Gene expression in cells collected from BAL samples of vaccinated macaques revealed a unique signature associated with enhanced development of adaptive immune responses relative to control macaques. Conclusions: We demonstrate that a room temperature stable peptide vaccine based on known immunogenic HLA class I bound CTL epitopes from the nucleocapsid protein can provide protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in nonhuman primates.","Harris, Paul E.; Brasel, Trevor Massey Christopher Herst C.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: 164 COVID-19 suspected patients were from the Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University. Oropharyngeal swab specimens were acquired by respiratory doctors under standardized conditions. Specific nucleic acids of SARS-CoV-2, influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus A and B, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, along with pneumonic mycoplasma were detected by real-time fluorescence PCR. Symptomatic, epidemiologic, laboratory and radiological data of the patients were obtained from the electronic medical record system of our hospital. RESULTS: Among the 164 patients, 3 were positive for SARS-CoV-2, 15 were positive for other respiratory viruses and 16 were positive for pneumonic mycoplasma. Of the positive patients above, 1 patient was co-infected with SARS-CoV-2 and adenovirus, and 1 was co-infected with influenza B and pneumonic mycoplasma. The 3 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were clinically diagnosed as COVID-19 because they meet the diagnostic criteria listed in ""Chinese Clinical Guidance for COVID-19 Pneumonia diagnosis and treatment"", including epidemic history, symptom and pathogenic detection, as well as abnormalities of the laboratory and radiological data. However, the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients were non-specific compared to those of the patients infected with other respiratory viruses. CONCLUSIONS: The endemic common respiratory pathogens are more prevalent than SARS-CoV-2 in the SARS-CoV-2 non-epidemic areas of this research.

Social distancing was at the heart of almost every measure taken by the government. The main themes of these interventions are as follows: travel bans, suspending religious activities, closure of non-essential shops, enforcing changes at workplaces, and imposing curfews. This was followed by the gradual return to working life with various precautions to prevent a spike in the number of cases. The imposed measures in SA succeeded in reducing the burden of Covid-19 and its fatality rate.

Six months after beginning AL treatment, prolactin levels were above ULN in 2/32 (6.3%) patients. Among 32 study completers, 81.3% reported sexual dysfunction in &#8805;1 domain at screening versus 56.3% at 6 months after starting AL treatment. Diminished sexual desire was the most common patient-reported sexual complaint at screening (46.9%); at 6 months, it was reported by 18.8%. In this post hoc analysis, the high levels of prolactin observed at screening decreased during AL treatment, and modest improvements in sexual side effects were evident in patients with schizophrenia.","Kelly, Deanna L; Claxton, Amy; Bidollari, Ilda; Du, Yangchun",Psychiatry Res,76,16

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is at the center of a recent emergency situation that requires increased attention from health care professionals, including pharmacists. This study was aimed at providing an overview of pharmacists' roles in disasters and formulating a definition of expected roles and tasks through which they can perform these roles properly. Methods: A systematic review was conducted utilizing a literature search performed on the Medline, EMBASE and PubMed databases. The last search occurred on 14 July 2020. Data were extracted and recorded on a data extraction sheet by the reviewers, then categorized using the prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery (PPRR) model. Study quality was evaluated using the Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) checklist. Results: Fifteen articles addressing pharmacists' roles in disasters were included. Of these, three addressed pharmacists' roles during the COVID-19 pandemic. Pharmacists' roles in the prevention of emergencies, including COVID-19, are focused on chronic disease medication supply and education. Regarding pharmacists' preparedness to perform their roles in disasters, they were more focused on health policy and population health planning, especially regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. Direct patient care continues to support patients through medication availability, and pharmacists' clinical roles are examples of their response to disasters. In addition, pharmacists have an important role in disaster recovery that involves several activities, such as restocking emergency kits and reestablishing normal stock. Studies were generally of a reasonable quality. However, some limitations were noted among studies, and higher quality studies that contribute to existing knowledge are needed. Conclusion: Health care systems' utilization of pharmacists' new roles can result in a well-prepared disaster response, as observed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Pharmacists' engagement in decision-making processes and adequate demonstration of pharmacists' nontraditional roles in the literature can facilitate the health care community's acceptance of such roles.","Aburas, Wejdan; Alshammari, Thamir M",Saudi pharmaceutical journal,76,10

Filomicelles have a ~ 6-fold stronger interaction with reconstituted SR-BI than PEO-PBD spheres. HDL, and the lipid transport inhibitor, BLT-1, both block the uptake of filomicelles by macrophages and Idla7 cells, the latter are constitutively expressing SR-BI (Idla7-SR-BI). Co-injections of HDL and filomicelles into wild-type mice reduced filomicelle signal in the liver and increased filomicelle plasma levels. The same was true with SCARB1-/- mice. SR-BI binding is followed by phagocytosis for filomicelle macrophage entry, but only SR-BI is needed for entry into Idla7-SR-BI cells. PEO-PBD spheres did not interact strongly with SR-BI in the above experiments.

Our study aimed to evaluate the knowledge, preparedness, counselling practices of healthcare workers regarding COVID-19, and the perceived barriers to adequately prevent and control COVID-19 in Yemen. METHODS: Healthcare workers (HCWs) from major healthcare facilities participated in this cross-sectional study. A self-administered questionnaire comprising of five main domains (demographics, knowledge, self-preparedness, counselling practice, perceived barriers) was distributed among HCWs after obtaining informed consent. A convenient sampling technique was used. Descriptive and inferential analyses were applied using SPSS software. RESULTS: A total of 1000 participants were initially targeted to participate in the study with 514 (51.4%) responding, of which 55.3% were female. Physicians and nurses constituted the largest proportion of participants, with 39.5% and 33.3%, respectively. The median scores for knowledge, self-preparedness, and counselling practice were 8 (out of 9), 9 (out of 15), and 25 (out of 30), respectively. The physician group showed a statistically significant association with better knowledge compared to the nurse group only, P<0.001. Males had higher preparedness scores than females, p<0.001. Also, the intensive care unit (ICU) and emergency departments presented a statistically significant difference by which the participants from these departments were more prepared compared to the others (e.g. outpatients, paediatrics and surgery) with P < 0.0001. The lack of awareness among the general population about COVID-19 preventive measures was perceived as the most common barrier for the adequate prevention and control of COVID-19 in Yemen (89.1%). CONCLUSION: The major highlight of this study is that HCWs have, overall, good knowledge, suboptimal preparedness, and adequate counselling practices prior to the outbreak of COVID-19 in Yemen, despite the high number of perceived barriers. However, urgent action and interventions are needed to improve the preparedness of HCWs to manage COVID-19. The perceived barriers also need to be fully addressed by the local healthcare authorities and international organisations working in Yemen for adequate prevention and control measures to be in place in managing COVID-19.","Al-Ashwal, Fahmi Y; Kubas, Mohammed; Zawiah, Mohammed; Bitar, Ahmad Naoras; Mukred Saeed, Ramzi; Sulaiman, Syed Azhar Syed; Khan, Amer Hayat; Ghadzi, Siti Maisharah Sheikh",PLoS One,76,26

Output and unemployment are probably the most important variables for measuring negative effects of the pandemics from macroeconomic perspective. Different organisations, both national and international, have announced their autumn and winter prognoses of these variables for 2020. None of them are optimistic. Bosnian economy has been hit by the worst recession in the last two decades. International Monetary Fund approved US$ 361 million in urgent support to BiH in 2020 to alleviate the COVID-19 negative economic consequences. This paper investigates potential economic impact of that financial support with application of simple arithmetic. In the paper the Okun’s law is used as methodological framework to assessing effects of the IMF rapid financial instrument. Relationship between real economic growth and change in unemployment rate is estimated for BiH economy and it served as a basis for analysis of potential impact of the IMF financial support. Findings of the paper show that the IMF financial support effect amounts to about 3.7% of GDP of BiH. Effects on the unemployment rate are estimated to 2.3 percentage points less from what it would otherwise have been. Since the early estimations of the GDP in BiH indicated deep recession in 2020 this financial support proved to be insufficient stimulus to BiH economy. Decision makers in the country should be aware of their responsibility for providing larger stimulus packages in order to avoid bad economic and social outcomes in the near future.","Halebić, Jasmin",BH Ekonomski Forum = BH Economic Forum,76,22

No Experimento 2, a perda gestacional entre o D22 e D37-67 foi similar (P>0,1) sendo no controle (19% [36/185]), BE (15% [28/182]), e E2+P4 (15% 28/184]). No D22, o FD foi maior (P<0,05) no grupo controle (11,9 ± 0,14), do que no BE (11,3 ± 0,1) e E2+P4 (11,5 ± 0,1). A proporção de novilhas detectadas em estro no D24 não diferiu (P>0,1) entre os grupos. Entretanto, a taxa de crescimento do FD (mm/dia) foi maior (P<0,05) no grupo BE (0,89 ± 0,08) do que no controle (0,59 ± 0,07) e E2+P4 (0,66 ± 0,09). A taxa de prenhez para a segunda IATF foi maior (P<0,05) no grupo BE (47% [94/200]) quando comparado ao controle (37% [76/203]), mas não diferiu (P>0,1) para o grupo E2+P4 (43% [93/214]). A prenhez acumulativa (primeira e segunda IATFs) não diferiu (P>0,1) entre o controle (59% [204/344]), BE (65% [227/349]) e E2+P4 (64% [220/342]). Conclui-se que a administração de 1 mg de BE ou 1 mg de E2 + 9 mg de P4 aos 14 dias pós-IATF antecipa a luteólise nas novilhas NG mas não compromete a gestação. O tratamento com 1mg de BE aumenta a taxa de prenhez da ressincronização nas novilhas NG.","MOTTA, IGOR GARCIA",,76,20

The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on suicidal ingestions reported to the California Poison Control System (CPCS). METHODS: This was a cross-sectional comparison of suicidal ingestions reported to the CPCS during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic compared to suicidal ingestions reported during the same period in 2018 and 2019. RESULTS: The CPCS received 19,607 call for suicidal ingestions during the study periods, of which 13,800 were in the pre-COVID era (2018 and 2019) and 5,807 were in the COVID era. The median (IQR) number of suicidal ingestions per month decreased from 2,286 (2,240-2,364) to 1,940 (1,855-2,045; p = 0.02). This decrease was consistent and significant across all age groups except those age 70 or older. Ingestions without adverse events decreased by 101 cases/month (95% confidence interval [CI] = 136.8 to 65; p = 0.0003), minor outcomes decreased by 156.6 cases/month (95% CI = 226.2 to 87.1; p = 0.001), and moderate outcomes decreased by 96 cases/month (95% CI = 143.9 to 48.1; p = 0.00021). Major outcomes decreased from 793 (4.99%) cases in the pre-COVID era to 315 (4.60%) cases in the COVID era (risk ratio = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.81 to 1.05). The number of deaths decreased by 3.7 cases/month (95% CI = -8.3 to 0.92, p = 0.10). CONCLUSIONS: Despite concern for worsening suicidality, calls regarding suicidal ingestions to the nation's largest poison control center decreased during the COVID era compared to the pre-COVID era. This study provides evidence that the pandemic's effects on modern society remain difficult to predict. Further effort is needed to understand how pandemic will affect American's mental health.","Ontiveros, Sam T; Levine, Michael D; Cantrell, F L; Thomas, Caroline; Minns, Alicia B",Acad. emerg. med,76,13

PubMed was systematically searched up May 2020 to identify studies that took into consideration various ethical issues that have been arising from the Covid-19 outbreak. The eligibility of the papers was determined by two authors, who screened the results mediated by a third author. In order to facilitate the screening, the titles were divided into five sub-thematic macro-areas, namely allocation, policy, specialist, clinical trials, and technology and, when possible, per geographical area. Specifically, a posteriori, we decided to focus on the papers referring to policies and technology, as they highlighted ethical issues that are not overused and worthy of particular attention. Thus, 38 studies out of 233 met our inclusion criteria and were fully analysed. Accordingly, this review touches on themes such as fairness, equity, transparency of information, the duty of care, racial disparities, the marginalisation of the poor, and privacy and ethical concerns. Overall, it was found that despite the increased awareness of interdisciplinarity and the essential reference to ethics, many scientific articles use it with little competence, considering it only a ""humanitarian"" enrichment. In fact, as we understand, reflecting a year after the outbreak of the pandemic, although Covid-19 is leading scientists to increasingly recognise the importance of ethical issues, there is still a lot of confusion that could be helped by establishing international guidelines to act as a moral compass in times of crisis.

However, their pathogenesis remains unclear and no clear prognostic factors have been identified. We have analyzed a cohort of mild/moderate hospitalized patients to identify possible clinical or immunological predictors of recovery from OD/GD. METHODS: Clinical and biological parameters were reviewed along with associated comorbidities. Chemosensory Complaint Score was administered on admission and 30 days after the first negative swab. Unpaired Wilcoxon and chi-squared tests were used to compare the variables in the patients who recovered versus those who did not. RESULTS: From a cohort of 119 hospitalized patients, 43 (36%) reported OD/GD on admission. 60.6% had a full recovery from OD and 69.2% from GD. Only the concentration of IL-10 on admission emerged as significantly associated with recovery of taste (p = 0.041) while allergic respiratory disease was more prevalent in the group who did not recover from OD (p = 0.049) and GD (p = 0.007). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that COVID-19 associated OD/GD is an inflammatory-mediated condition and that clinical and immunological parameters could predict the evolution of these symptoms.","Locatello, Luca Giovanni; Bruno, Chiara; Maggiore, Giandomenico; Cilona, Maria; Orlando, Pietro; Fancello, Giuseppe; Piccica, Matteo; Vellere, Iacopo; Lagi, Filippo; Trotta, Michele; Gallo, Oreste",Cytokine,76,1

One of the most affected activities is tourism due to travel restrictions imposed by precautionary measures. This is also reflected in the recreative use of the coastal strip. Consequently, beaches and coastal stretches of small municipalities can potentially become contagious outbreaks of COVID-19 if adequate control and management measures are not promptly implemented. During the 20th century, several factors, both natural and human induced, caused alterations to coastal processes and consequently to the services they were providing. Coastal environments are very vulnerable and sensitive to change. This raises the need for careful assessment prior to any intervention or strategy involving the coastal system. Several literature studies have been focused both in the past and in recent years on examining the main factors affecting coastal vulnerability highlighting critical issues and shortcomings. The present paper, addressing all critical issues from literature review, illustrates a consistent methodology to support coastal management which combines both physical and socio-economic aspects and provides for the quantification of two different coastal vulnerability indices. The approach adopted has led to a distinction of different coastal peculiarities and a mapping of risk levels providing, in addition, the basis for the implementation of strategies risks related to COVID-19. The methodology proposed can be a useful reference in several areas, in demonstrating its effectiveness it has been applied with respect to a coastal area in southern Italy.","Armenio, Elvira Mossa Michele Petrillo Antonio Felice",Ocean &amp; Coastal Management,76,16

This has generated renewed interest regarding whether corticosteroids should be used in non-COVID ARDS as well. The objective of this study was to summarize all RCTs examining the use of corticosteroids in ARDS. METHODS: The protocol of this study was pre-registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020200659). We searched online databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, CDC library of COVID research, CINAHL, and COCHRANE. We included RCTs that compared the effect of corticosteroids to placebo or usual care in adult patients with ARDS, including patients with COVID-19. Three reviewers abstracted data independently and in duplicate using a pre-specified standardized form. We assessed individual study risk of bias using the revised Cochrane ROB-2 tool and rated certainty in outcomes using GRADE methodology. We pooled data using a random effects model. The main outcome for this review was 28-day-mortality. RESULTS: We included 18 RCTs enrolling 2826 patients. The use of corticosteroids probably reduced mortality in patients with ARDS of any etiology (2740 patients in 16 trials, RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.72-0.95, ARR 8.0%, 95% CI 2.2-12.5%, moderate certainty). Patients who received a longer course of corticosteroids (over 7 days) had higher rates of survival compared to a shorter course.

This study aimed to compare the evaluation by 2 attending physicians and 2 resident physicians of the quality of videos on YouTube on neck dissection, a key indicator case in head and neck surgery. The authors aimed to assess the quality and quantity of YouTube videos available for development of a virtual surgical educational curriculum for trainees in otolaryngology. METHODS: Using the YouTube search feature, the top 10 videos by relevance and view count were compiled using the following search terms: radical neck dissection, selective neck dissection, modified radical neck dissection, lateral neck dissection, levels I-III neck dissection, levels II-IV, left neck dissection, right neck dissection, cervical nodal dissection, and supraomohyoid neck dissection. A total of 37 videos on neck dissection were identified and analyzed using the LAP-VEGaS criteria as well as author-specific modified LAP-VEGaS criteria. RESULTS: The mean comprehensive LAP-VEGaS score was 8.74 (SD 3.10). The majority of videos (24/37) were designated as medium quality; 10 of 37 videos were low quality and 3 of 37 videos were high quality. In the total group analysis, there was excellent inter-rater reliability between attending physicians (Cohen's kappa coefficient of 0.84) and good inter-rater reliability between resident physicians (Cohen's kappa coefficient of 0.58). There was no correlation between total view count, video age, or number of likes/dislikes and the overall LAP-VEGaS score. The presence of audio or written commentary had a moderate positive correlation with LAP-VEGaS score (adjusted R2 of 0.36). There was no statistically significant difference in video quality between videos posted by US and non-US based physicians (95% confidence interval -0.10 to 4.10; pâ¯=â¯0.06). However, videos made by an otolaryngology-trained physician had a LAP-VEGaS score that was 3.93 points higher (95% confidence interval 2.34-5.52; p < 0.001) than that of videos made by a nonotolaryngology-trained physician. CONCLUSIONS: Online videos of neck dissection represent an increasingly ubiquitous and appropriate resource for trainees in learning otolaryngology key indicator cases. While free-to-access video repositories, such as YouTube, have become increasingly popular among trainees as a primary resource for learning and preparing for surgical cases, they lack consistent quality and as such, global efforts should be taken to improve the breadth and depth of educational video content in otolaryngology.

For the first time, a neural network learns the mapping between the preferences of the trader, i.e. risk aversion parameters, and the optimal controls. An important challenge in learning this mapping is that in intraday trading, trader's actions influence price dynamics in closed loop via the market impact. The exploration--exploitation tradeoff generated by the efficient execution is addressed by tuning the trader's preferences to ensure long enough trajectories are produced during the learning phase. The issue of scarcity of financial data is solved by transfer learning: the neural network is first trained on trajectories generated thanks to a Monte-Carlo scheme, leading to a good initialization before training on historical trajectories. Moreover, to answer to genuine requests of financial regulators on the explainability of machine learning generated controls, we project the obtained""blackbox controls""on the space usually spanned by the closed-form solution of the stylized optimal trading problem, leading to a transparent structure. For more realistic loss functions that have no closed-form solution, we show that the average distance between the generated controls and their explainable version remains small. This opens the door to the acceptance of ML-generated controls by financial regulators.","Leal, Laura; Lauriere, Mathieu; Lehalle, Charles-Albert",,76,1

Here we report a comprehensive analysis of CoV-specific antibody repertoires in 231 children and 1168 adults using phage immunoprecipitation sequencing. Seroprevalence of antibodies against endemic HCoVs ranged between approximately 4% and 27% depending on the species and cohort. We identified at least 136 novel linear B cell epitopes. Antibody repertoires against endemic HCoVs were qualitatively different between children and adults in that anti-HCoV IgG specificities more frequently found among children targeted functionally important and structurally conserved regions of the spike, nucleocapsid, and matrix proteins. Moreover, antibody specificities targeting the highly conserved fusion peptide region and S2' cleavage site of the spike protein were broadly cross-reactive with peptides of epidemic human and nonhuman coronaviruses. In contrast, an acidic tandem repeat in the N-terminal region of the Nsp3 subdomain of the HCoV-HKU1 polyprotein was the predominant target of antibody responses in adult donors. Our findings shed light on the dominant species-specific and pan-CoV target sites of human antibody responses to coronavirus infection, thereby providing important insights for the development of prophylactic or therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and vaccine design.","Khan, Taushif; Rahman, Mahbuba; Ali, Fatima Al; Huang, Susie S Y; Ata, Manar; Zhang, Qian; Bastard, Paul; Liu, Zhiyong; Jouanguy, Emmanuelle; Béziat, Vivien; Cobat, Aurélie; Nasrallah, Gheyath K; Yassine, Hadi M; Smatti, Maria K; Saeed, Amira; Vandernoot, Isabelle; Goffard, Jean-Christophe; Smits, Guillaume; Migeotte, Isabelle; Haerynck, Filomeen; Meyts, Isabelle; Abel, Laurent; Casanova, Jean-Laurent; Hasan, Mohammad R; Marr, Nico",JCI insight,76,26

METHODS: Main outcome was to investigate the agreement between nasopharyngeal swab (NPs) and conjunctival swabs (Cs) in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. We divided patients into four groups: (1) NPs and Cs both negative (C-NF-), (2) NPs positive and Cs negative (NFs+Cs-), (3) NPs negative and Cs positive (NFs-Cs+), and (4) NPs and Cs both positive (NFs-Cs+). The secondary outcomes were to correlate Cs results with systemic clinical parameters such as: oxygen saturation (SpO2), dyspnea degree (DP), radiologic pulmonary impairment based on chest radiography (XR) or computed tomography (CT), blood chemistry as D-Dimer (D-Dimer), fibrinogen, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and C-reactive protein (C-RP). RESULTS: A total of 100 conjunctival swabs in 50 patients with SARS-CoV-2 have been enrolled in this interventional clinical trials. Ocular signs (conjunctivitis) were present in five patients (10%). NPs and Cs highlighted a poor level of agreement (0.025; p = 0.404). Median SpO2 levels are the highest in the NF-C- group (98%) and the lowest (90%) in the group NF+C+ (p = 0.001). Pulmonary impairment was statistically significantly different between NFs and Cs groups (p = 0.019). Pulmonary impairment score increased from NFs-Cs- group (3.8 ± 3.9), to NFs+Cs+ group (6.7 ± 4.1). Intensive care unit patients showed higher COVID-19 Cs positivity in conjunctiva (12.5%) against hospitalized ones (5.8%). CONCLUSIONS: In patients hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 the virus can be detected in conjunctival swab. Intensive care unit patients may reveal a higher COVID-19 presence in the conjunctiva. The most severe pulmonary impairment can be observed in NFs and Cs positivity. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov registration.

This retrospective cohort study describes mortality rates overall and according to demographic characteristics and explores predictors of admission to intensive care unit and death among 255 persons living with HIV with severe acute respiratory syndrome and confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil. We found that the overall mortality rate was 4.1/1,000 person-days, with a case-fatality of 34%. Higher rates occurred among older adults, Black/Mixed skin color/race patients, and those with lower schooling. In a multivariable analysis adjusted for age, sex, CD4 count, viral load and number of comorbidities, skin color/race, and schooling remained significantly associated with higher mortality. Although tenofovir use was more frequent among survivors in the univariable analysis, we failed to find a statistically significant association between tenofovir use and survival in the multivariable analysis. Our findings suggest that social vulnerabilities related to both HIV and COVID-19 significantly impact the risk of death, overtaking traditional risk factors such as age, sex, CD4 count, and comorbidities.","Rocha, S Q; Avelino-Silva, V I; Tancredi, M V; Jamal, L F; Ferreira, P R A; Tayra, A; Ferreira, P M; Carvalhanas, T; Domingues, C S B; Souza, R A; Gianna, M C; Kalichman, A O; Leite, O H M; Souza, T N L; Gomes E Costa, D A; Furtado, J J D; Costa, A F",AIDS Care,76,21

A literature search up from 1 January 2020 to 21 March 2021 was conducted in three electronic databases, namely, PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus, in order to identify studies on periodontal disease alone or in conjunction with diabetes mellitus, reporting any relation with SARS-CoV-2 infection as a primary outcome. Only articles published in the English language were included. Due to the lack of studies, we decided to collect all the theoretical and clinical evidence suggesting a possible biological pathway evidencing the relationship among PD, DM, and SARS-CoV-2 infection. From a total of 29 articles, 12 were included for final review studies (five reviews, two hypotheses, one Special Issue, one perspective, one commentary, one case-control study, and one case report). In addition, this systematic review article hypothesizes the correlation between PD and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) by expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in periodontal tissue and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. T2DM is a metabolic disorder characterized by high blood glucose levels resulting from altered insulin secretion or action. Likewise, periodontitis and T2DM are inflammatory disorders with a bidirectional association, and both diseases have a similar immunomodulatory cascade and cytokine profile. ACE2 is a crucial component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and the key factor of entry in the cells by the new SARS-CoV-2. ACE2 is widely distributed in the lung and kidneys, and interestingly has a great distribution in the oral cavity, principally in the tongue and periodontal tissue. ACE2 in periodontal tissue plays a crucial role between health and disease. Moreover, the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/MasR axis is downregulated in the dysbiotic and inflammatory periodontal environment. Nevertheless, the balance of ACE2 activity is modified in the context of concurrent diabetes, increasing the expression of ACE2 by the uncontrolled glycemia chronic in T2DM. Therefore, the uncontrolled hyperglycemia possibly increases the risk of developing periodontitis and triggering overexpression of ACE2 in periodontal tissue of T2DM patients, with these events potentially being essential to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the development of mild-to-severe form of COVID-19. In this sense, we would like to point out that the need for randomized controlled trials is imperative to support this association.","Casillas Santana, Miguel Angel; Arreguín Cano, Juan Antonio; Dib Kanán, Alejandro; Dipp Velázquez, Farid Alonso; Munguía, Paulina Del Carmen Sosa; Martínez Castañón, Gabriel Alejandro; Castillo Silva, Brenda Eréndida; Sámano Valencia, Carolina; Salas Orozco, Marco Felipe",Medicina (Kaunas),76,29

Although many protocols regarding venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis or therapeutic (full-dose) anticoagulation have been conducted worldwide, primarily in hospitalised adult patients, details on paediatric patients, if included, are limited or incomplete. The current evidences suggest that anticoagulation therapy with low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) appears to be associated with better prognosis in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 induced coagulopathies or elevated D-dimer levels. Our recommendations are intended to offer guidance for anticoagulation prophylaxis and treatment in COVID-19 children and adolescent patients and not intend to supersede the clinician judgement.

Secondary endpoints included death, shock, need for mechanical ventilation, need for supplemental oxygen, arrhythmia, venous thromboembolism, encephalopathy, abnormal troponin level, and length of stay. RESULTS: Multivariable analysis identified cancer as an independent predictor of COVID-19-associated severe disease among all infected patients. Patients with cancer were more likely to develop COVID-19-associated severe disease than were those without cancer (hazard ratio [HR], 2.02; 95% CI, 1.53-2.68; P<.001). Furthermore, patients with both cancer and CVD had a higher likelihood of COVID-19-associated severe disease compared with those with either cancer (HR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.11-3.10; P=.02) or CVD (HR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.21-2.66; P=.004) alone. Patients died more frequently if they had both cancer and CVD compared with either cancer (35% vs 17%; P=.004) or CVD (35% vs 21%; P=.009) alone. Arrhythmias and encephalopathy were also more frequent in patients with both cancer and CVD compared with those with cancer alone. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a history of both cancer and CVD are at significantly higher risk of experiencing COVID-19-associated adverse outcomes. Aggressive public health measures are needed to mitigate the risks of COVID-19 infection in this vulnerable patient population.","Ganatra, Sarju; Dani, Sourbha S; Redd, Robert; Rieger-Christ, Kimberly; Patel, Rushin; Parikh, Rohan; Asnani, Aarti; Bang, Vigyan; Shreyder, Katherine; Brar, Simarjeet S; Singh, Amitoj; Kazi, Dhruv S; Guha, Avirup; Hayek, Salim S; Barac, Ana; Gunturu, Krishna S; Zarwan, Corrine; Mosenthal, Anne C; Yunus, Shakeeb A; Kumar, Amudha; Patel, Jaymin M; Patten, Richard D; Venesy, David M; Shah, Sachin P; Resnic, Frederic S; Nohria, Anju; Baron, Suzanne J",J Natl Compr Canc Netw,76,25

A total of 1,114 patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to three designated COVID-19 hospitals in Wuhan, China from January 18, 2020, to March 24, 2020, were included in this study. We examined the relationship between peripheral blood levels of D-dimer, and clinical classification and prognosis, as well as its related influencing factors. D-dimer levels were found to be related to the clinical classification and the prognosis of clinical outcome. D-dimer levels were more likely to be abnormal in severely and critically ill patients compared with mild and ordinary cases, while D-dimer levels of patients who had died were significantly higher than those of surviving patients according to the results of the first and last lab tests. The results from ROC analyses for mortality risk showed that the AUCs of D-dimer were 0.909, YI was 0.765 at the last lab test, and a D-dimer value of 2.025 mg/L was regarded to be the optimal probability cutoff for a prognosis of death. In addition, we found that patients with advanced age, male gender, dyspnea symptoms, and some underlying diseases have a higher D-dimer value (p < 0.05). In short, D-dimer is related to the clinical classification and can be used to evaluate the prognosis of COVID-19 patients. The D-dimer value of 2.025 mg/L was the optimal probability cutoff for judging an outcome of death. Advanced age, male gender, dyspnea symptoms, and some underlying diseases are influencing factors for D-dimer levels, which impacts the prognosis of patients.","He, Xiaokang; Yao, Fei; Chen, Jie; Wang, Yan; Fang, Xiangming; Lin, Xuan; Long, Hui; Wang, Qiang; Wu, Qingming",Sci Rep,76,1

Here, we describe the near-atomic-resolution structure of the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase complex consisting of the nsp12 catalytic subunit and nsp7-nsp8 cofactors. This structure highly resembles the counterpart of SARS-CoV with conserved motifs for all viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases and suggests a mechanism of activation by cofactors. Biochemical studies reveal reduced activity of the core polymerase complex and lower thermostability of individual subunits of SARS-CoV-2 compared with SARS-CoV. These findings provide important insights into RNA synthesis by coronavirus polymerase and indicate adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 toward humans with a relatively lower body temperature than the natural bat hosts.","Peng, Qi; Peng, Ruchao; Yuan, Bin; Zhao, Jingru; Wang, Min; Wang, Xixi; Wang, Qian; Sun, Yan; Fan, Zheng; Qi, Jianxun; Gao, George F; Shi, Yi",Cell Rep,76,21

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Prospective study in patients undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopy in urology or gynaecology within 2 academic hospitals. Patients underwent local preoperative COVID-19 screening using a symptoms questionnaire. Patients with suspicious screening underwent coronavirus real time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and were excluded from robotic surgery if positive. Patients with symptoms postsurgery were systematically tested for coronavirus by RT-PCR. One-month postsurgery, all patients had a telephone consultation to evaluate COVID-19 symptoms. RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients underwent robotic surgery during the study period (median age: 63-years [IQR: 53-70], 1.8 male: female ratio). Oncology was the main indication for robotic surgery (nâ¯=â¯62, 91.2%) and 26 patients (38.2%) received a chest CT-scan prior to surgery.

Using Pellow's critical environmental justice theory, we examine how the crisis has made more visible and exacerbated links between racism, poverty, and health while providing opportunities to enact change through collective embodied health movements. We describe new collaborations and the potential for meaningful opportunities at the intersections between health, antiracist, environmental, and political movements that are advocating for the types of transformational change described by critical environmental justice.","Powers, Martha; Brown, Phil; Poudrier, Grace; Ohayon, Jennifer Liss; Cordner, Alissa; Alder, Cole; Atlas, Marina Goreau",J Health Soc Behav,76,1

Clinical outcome of AIS in the course of COVID-19 remains unknown. We compared early clinical outcome and mortality of COVID-positive (+) patients admitted for AIS with COVID-negative (-) ones. We hypothesized that COVID+ patients would have poorer clinical outcomes and present a higher rate of TEs and mortality compared with COVID- ones. METHODS: In this multicentric observational retrospective study, we enrolled patients over 18 years old admitted for AIS in 3 stroke units of the Parisian region during lockdown from March 17, 2020, to May 2, 2020. COVID-19 status as well as demographic, clinical, biological, and imaging data was collected retrospectively from medical records. Poor outcome was defined as modified Rankin score (mRS) 3-6 (3-6) at discharge. We also compared TE frequency and mortality rate through a composite criterion in both groups. RESULTS: Two hundred and sixteen patients were enrolled; mean age was 68 years old, and 63% were male. Forty patients were CO-VID+ (18.5%) and 176 were COVID-. Obesity was statistically more frequent in the COVID+ group (36 vs. 13% p < 0.01). The percentage of patients with mRS (3-6) at discharge was higher in the COVID+ group compared with the COVID- group (60 vs. 41%, p = 0.034). The main predictor of presenting a mRS (3-6) at discharge was high NIHSS score at admission (OR, CI 95%: 1.325, 1.22-1.43). Mortality rate was higher in the COVID+ group (12 vs. 3.4%, p = 0.033) as well as TE frequency (15 vs. 2.8%, p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: In this study, patients with AIS infected by SARS-CoV-2 showed a poorer early outcome than COVID- ones. However, when compared to other factors, COVID-19 was not a significant predictor of poor outcome. Vascular morbidity and mortality rates were significantly higher in the COVID+ group compared with the COVID- group.","Calmettes, Julie; Peres, Roxane; Goncalves, Bruno; Varlan, David; Turc, Guillaume; Obadia, Michael; Nardin, Clotilde; Meppiel, Elodie; De Broucker, Thomas; Mazighi, Mikael; Lyoubi, Aicha",Cerebrovasc Dis,76,30

This population upheld specific characteristics in terms of age and sex, lack of significant comorbidities, and a general scarcity of risk factors for sustaining a severe COVID-19 illness. We present the measures taken to increase vaccination compliance, and the vaccination rate that followed these actions. Our secondary goal was to compare between vaccination rates in frontline battalions and highly essential military units (group A) and rear administration and support military units (group B). METHODS: This was a retrospective review that included 70 military units that were composed of 18,719 individuals of both sexes, mostly free of significant comorbidities. We divided the challenges of maximizing vaccination rates into two main categories: vaccine compliance (including communication and information) and logistical challenges. We compared the vaccination rates in groups A and B using a multivariable linear regression model. A P-value of .05 was considered significant. RESULTS: The mean age in 70 military units was 22.77 ± 1.35 (range 18-50) years, 71.13% males. A total of 726 (3.88%) individuals have been found positive for SARS-CoV-2 between March 1st, 2020 and February 18th, 2021. On February 18th, 2021, 54 days after the vaccination campaign was launched, 15,871 (84.79%) of the study population have been vaccinated by the first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, expressing an 88.21% compliance rate (excluding recovered COVID-19 cases who were not prioritized to be vaccinated at this stage). Vaccination compliance in military units from group A was found to be higher when compared to group B (P < .001), leading to a 90.02% of group A population being either previously SARS-CoV-2 positive or COVID-19 vaccinated. CONCLUSIONS: A designated army campaign led by a multidisciplinary team could rapidly achieve a high COVID-19 vaccination rate. The information presented can serve organizations worldwide with similar characteristics that plan a mass COVID-19 vaccination campaign.","Segal, David; Arzi, Yonatan Ilibman; Bez, Maxim; Cohen, Matan; Rotschield, Jacob; Fink, Noam; Karp, Erez",Mil. med,76,16

DESIGN: Prospective cross-sectional study PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-six (56) subjects (112 eyes) with a diagnosis of glaucoma or glaucoma suspect METHODS: The three-dimensional shape of the eyeball on 3D-MRI scans was classified according to the dimension of the longest diameter: axial dimension (prolate sphere), group 1; horizontal dimension (horizontally oblate sphere), group 2; and vertical dimension (vertically oblate sphere), group 3. The deviation of the CRVT, as a surrogate of lamina cribrosa (LC) shift, was measured from the center of the Bruch's membrane opening (BMO) demarcated by OCT imaging, with the horizontal midline as 0° and the superior location as a positive value. The angular location of the longest EOB was also measured. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Positions of CRVT and EOB according to the three-dimensional shape of an eyeball RESULTS: Among 112 eyes, 54 (48%) had a prolate shape (group 1), 23 (21%) a horizontally oblate shape (group 2), and 35 (31%) a vertically oblate shape (group 3). The angular deviation of the CRVT differed among the groups: to the nasal side in group 1, to the temporal side in group 2, and along the vertical meridian in group 3. In cases of asymmetric eyeball shape, the CRVT was deviated toward the undergrown side from the overgrown side, regardless of grouping. The angular location of the longest EOB was in the direction opposite to the CRVT position (P < 0.001). A generalized estimating equation analysis revealed that the temporal location of the CRVT was associated with older age (P = 0.001), nasal location of the longest EOB (P < 0.001), and oblate shape of the eyeball (P <0.001, group 2; P = 0.007, group 3). CONCLUSIONS: The position of the CRVT and EOB were associated with the three-dimensional eyeball shape. Considering that infant ONH morphology is highly uniform, various modes of eyeball expansion during growth can result in diverse directionalities of offset between the LC and BMO in adults.","Lee, Kyoung Min; Park, Sun-Won; Kim, Martha; Oh, Sohee; Kim, Seok Hwan",Ophthalmology,76,29

However, involving a strong perturbation of daily life, it often causes psychosocial distress, and severe financial and social costs. These may act as mechanisms limiting the adoption of the measure in the first place or the adherence throughout its full duration. In addition, difficulty of recognizing mild symptoms or lack of symptoms may impact awareness of the infection and further limit adoption. Here, we study an epidemic model on a network of contacts accounting for limited adherence and delayed awareness to self-isolation, along with fatigue causing overhasty termination. The model allows us to estimate the role of each ingredient and analyze the tradeoff between adherence and duration of self-isolation. We find that the epidemic threshold is very sensitive to an effective compliance that combines the effects of imperfect adherence, delayed awareness and fatigue. If adherence improves for shorter quarantine periods, there exists an optimal duration of isolation, shorter than the infectious period. However, heterogeneities in the connectivity pattern, coupled to a reduced compliance for highly active individuals, may almost completely offset the effectiveness of self-isolation measures on the control of the epidemic.","Meijere, Giulia de; Colizza, Vittoria; Valdano, Eugenio; Castellano, Claudio",,76,5

As the number of COVID-19 cases increased in Massachusetts, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health mandated that all health care workers be screened for symptoms daily prior to entering any hospital or health care facility. We rapidly created a digital COVID-19 symptom screening tool to enable this screening for a large, academic, integrated health care delivery system, Partners HealthCare, in Boston, Massachusetts. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to describe the design and development of the COVID Pass COVID-19 symptom screening application and report aggregate usage data from the first three months of its use across the organization. METHODS: Using agile principles, we designed, tested, and implemented a solution over the span of one week using progressively customized development approaches as the requirements and use case become more solidified. We developed the minimum viable product (MVP) of a mobile-responsive, web-based, self-service application using research electronic data capture (REDCap). For employees without access to a computer or mobile device to use the self-service application, we established a manual process where in-person, socially distanced screeners asked employees entering the site if they have symptoms and then manually recorded the responses in an Office 365 Form. A custom .NET Framework application solution was developed as COVID Pass was scaled. We collected log data from the .NET application, REDCap, and Microsoft Office 365 from the first three months of enterprise deployment (March 30 to June 30, 2020). Aggregate descriptive statistics, including overall employee attestations by day and site, employee attestations by application method (COVID Pass automatic screening vs manual screening), employee attestations by time of day, and percentage of employees reporting COVID-19 symptoms, were obtained. RESULTS: We rapidly created the MVP and gradually deployed it across the hospitals in our organization. By the end of the first week, the screening application was being used by over 25,000 employees each weekday. After three months, 2,169,406 attestations were recorded with COVID Pass. Over this period, 1865/160,159 employees (1.2%) reported positive symptoms. 1,976,379 of the 2,169,406 attestations (91.1%) were generated from the self-service screening application. The remainder were generated either from manual attestation processes (174,865/2,169,406, 8.1%) or COVID Pass kiosks (25,133/2,169,406, 1.2%). Hospital staff continued to work 24 hours per day, with staff attestations peaking around shift changes between 7 and 8 AM, 2 and 3 PM, 4 and 6 PM, and 11 PM and midnight. CONCLUSIONS: Using rapid, agile development, we quickly created and deployed a dedicated employee attestation application that gained widespread adoption and use within our health system. Further, we identified 1865 symptomatic employees who otherwise may have come to work, potentially putting others at risk. We share the story of our implementation, lessons learned, and source code (via GitHub) for other institutions who may want to implement similar solutions.","Zhang, Haipeng; Dimitrov, Dimitar; Simpson, Lynn; Plaks, Nina; Singh, Balaji; Penney, Stephen; Charles, Jo; Sheehan, Rosemary; Flammini, Steven; Murphy, Shawn; Landman, Adam",JMIR Form Res,76,22

However, the molecule also has many other biological properties that are unrelated to the oncotic activity. The purpose of this review is to examine the hemodynamic and systemic effects of albumin administration in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. Recent Findings: Besides plasma expansion, albumin appears to act against inflammation, facilitate immunocompetence, and improve cardiac and endothelial function, thus antagonizing critical steps in the pathophysiological cascade underlying decompensated cirrhosis. Summary: Increasing knowledge of the pathophysiological mechanisms of the disease, as well the pleiotropic properties of the molecule, provides the rationale for considering albumin as a multi-target disease-modifying agent in decompensated cirrhosis. Both oncotic and non-oncotic properties likely concur with the clinical benefits of long-term albumin administration recently demonstrated in these patients.","Tufoni, Manuel; Baldassarre, Maurizio; Zaccherini, Giacomo; Antognoli, Agnese; Caraceni, Paolo",Curr Hepatol Rep,76,22

HLH is characterised by a decreased capacity of interferon gamma production with an activated NK phenotype profile similar to other hyperinflammatory syndromes. Viruses are closely linked to the development of HLH as infectious triggers, and the break of tolerance to self-antigens is considered a critical mechanism involved in the development of immune-mediated conditions triggered by viral infections. Emerging studies in patients with COVID-19 are suggesting a key role of monocytes/macrophages in the pathogenesis of this viral infection, and there is a significant overlap between several features reported in severe COVID-19 and the features included in the HLH-2004 diagnostic criteria. Therefore, SARS-Cov-2, as other respiratory viruses, may also be considered a potential etiological trigger of HLH. The frequency of HLH in adult patients with severe COVID-19 is lower than 5%, although this figure could be underestimated considering that most reported cases lacked information about some specific criteria (mainly the histopathological criteria and the measurement of NK cell function and sCD25 levels). Because HLH is a multi-organ syndrome, the diagnostic approach in a patient with severe COVID-19 in whom HLH is suspected must be carried out in a syndromic and holistic way, and not in the light of isolated clinical or laboratory features. In COVID-19 patients presenting with persistent high fever, progressive pancytopenia, and hepatosplenic involvement, together with the characteristic triad of laboratory abnormalities (hyperferritinaemia, hypertriglyceridaemia, and hypofibrinogenaemia), the suspicion of HLH is high, and the diagnostic workup must be completed with specific immunological and histopathological studies.","Retamozo, Soledad; Brito-Zerón, Pilar; Sisó-Almirall, Antoni; Flores-Chávez, Alejandra; Soto-Cárdenas, María-José; Ramos-Casals, Manuel",Clin. rheumatol,76,16

The paper proposes a novel deep neural network framework to forecast the COVID-19 outbreak. The COVID-19Net framework combined 1D convolutional neural network, 2D convolutional neural network, and bidirectional gated recurrent units. COVID-19Net can well integrate the characteristics of time, space, and influencing factors of the COVID-19 accumulative cases. Three European countries with severe outbreaks were studied-Germany, Italy, and Spain-to extract spatiotemporal features and predict the number of confirmed cases. The prediction results acquired from COVID-19Net are compared to those obtained using a CNN, GRU, and CNN-GRU. The mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error, and root mean square error, which is commonly used model assessment indices, were used to compare the accuracy of the models. The results verified that COVID-19Net was notably more accurate than the other models. The mean absolute percentage error generated by COVID-19Net was 1.447 for Germany, 1.801 for Italy, and 2.828 for Spain, which was considerably better than those of the other models. This indicated that the proposed framework could accurately predict the accumulated number of confirmed cases in the three countries and serve as an essential reference for devising public health strategies. And also indicated that COVID-19 has high spatiotemporal relations, it suggests us to keep a social distance and avoid unnecessary trips.","Huang, Chiou-Jye; Shen, Yamin; Kuo, Ping-Huan; Chen, Yung-Hsiang",Socioecon Plann Sci,76,20

The likelihood that this hypothesis is valid is low, but it is easily tested. TESTABLE PREDICTIONS: 1) Autoantibodies and T cells to ACE2 may be found in patients with the lung damage but not in those without 2) There may be an HLA linkage with the delayed lung disease 3) Vaccines based on the spike protein might initiate the process by amplifying Fc mediated uptake of ACE2-Spike complexes into APCs. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The development of autoantibodies to ACE2 might predict the development of the inflammatory phase of Covid-19 disease.

Despite rigorous efforts worldwide to control the spread and human to human transmission of this virus, incidence and death due to COVID-19 continue to rise. Several drugs have been tested for treatment of COVID-19, including hydroxychloroquine. While a number of studies have shown that hydroxychloroquine can prolong QT interval, potentially increasing risk of ventricular arrhythmias and Torsade de Pointes, its effects on immune cell function have not been extensively examined. In the current review, an overview of coronaviruses, viral entry and pathogenicity, immunity upon coronavirus infection, and current therapy options for COVID-19 are briefly discussed. Further based on preclinical studies, we provide evidences that i) hydroxychloroquine impairs autophagy, which leads to accumulation of damaged/oxidized cytoplasmic constituents and interferes with cellular homeostasis, ii) this impaired autophagy in part reduces antigen processing and presentation to immune cells and iii) inhibition of endosome-lysosome system acidification by hydroxychloroquine not only impairs the phagocytosis process, but also potentially alters pulmonary surfactant in the lungs. Therefore, it is likely that hydroxychloroquine treatment may in fact impair host immunity in response to SARS-CoV-2, especially in elderly patients or those with co-morbidities. Further, this review provides a rationale for developing and selecting antiviral drugs and includes a brief review of traditional strategies combined with new drugs to combat COVID-19.","Devarajan, Asokan; Vaseghi, Marmar",Redox Biol,76,16

Contrary to these episodes, the USD did not show any safe haven characteristics during the pandemic. Furthermore, the estimated volatility and non-parametric value-at-risk of three currency portfolios indicate that COVID-19 was not as risky as previous stressful events.

The present research investigated the associations between social media exposure and depression during the COVID-19 outbreak by examining the mediating role of psychological distress and the moderating role of emotion regulation among members of the general public in China. Participants (N = 485) completed a set of questionnaires online, including demographic information, self-rated physical health, and social media exposure to topics related to COVID-19. The Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), and the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) were utilized to measure psychological distress about COVID-19, depression, and emotion regulation strategies, respectively. Results found that older age and greater levels of social media exposure were associated with more psychological distress about the virus (r = 0.14, p = 0.003;r = 0.22, p &lt; 0.001). Results of the moderated mediation model suggest that psychological distress mediated the relationship between social media exposure and depression (β = 0.10;Boot 95% CI = 0.07, 0.15). Furthermore, expressive suppression moderated the relationship between psychological distress and depression (β = 0.10, p = 0.017). The findings are discussed in terms of the need for mental health assistance for individuals at high risk of depression, including the elderly and individuals who reported greater psychological distress and those who showed preference usage of suppression, during the COVID-19 crisis.","Zhang, Y.

Methods: Sixty prepubertal male Wistar rats were distributed into two groups. Group 1 (Ischemia) animals (n=30) were divided into 5 subgroups (n=6). All animals were subjected to right testicular torsion of 720° lasting one hour followed by detorsion. Testicles were collected and arterial blood samples taken from abdominal aorta at the end of ischemic period and 0.5, 1, 6 and 24 hours following detorsion. The remaining rats (Group 2 - Sham operated) were divided into 5 subgroups and submitted to a similar procedure but detorsion was performed immediately following torsion of the right testis. Results: ATP and glucose concentrations were significantly decreased (P 0.05) in ischemia group as compared to sham group at the end of ischemic period. There was no difference in glycemia when comparing ischemic versus sham-operated rats. Conclusions: Unilateral one-hour testicular torsion causes a decrease in ipsilateral testicular perfusion resulting in decreased testicular concentrations of glucose and ATP. This finding suggests that one-hour unilateral testicular torsion impairs testicular capacity to produce ATP (energy) due to glucose storage depletion and reduced glucose uptake. Similar concentrations of glucose and ATP in testicular tissues of rats submitted to ischemia (Group 1) and sham-operated rats (Group 2) following detorsion implies the possible reversibility of these changes.","Botelho Guimarães, Sérgio; Roberto Leitão de Vasconcelos, Paulo",Acta cir. bras.,76,26

Facility-wide testing of residents and health care personnel (HCP) can identify asymptomatic and presymptomatic infections and facilitate infection prevention and control interventions (3-5). Seven state or local health departments conducted initial facility-wide testing of residents and staff members in 288 nursing homes during March 24-June 14, 2020. Two of the seven health departments conducted testing in 195 nursing homes as part of facility-wide testing all nursing homes in their state, which were in low-incidence areas (i.e., the median preceding 14-day cumulative incidence in the surrounding county for each jurisdiction was 19 and 38 cases per 100,000 persons); 125 of the 195 nursing homes had not reported any COVID-19 cases before the testing. Ninety-five of 22,977 (0.4%) persons tested in 29 (23%) of these 125 facilities had positive SARS-CoV-2 test results. The other five health departments targeted facility-wide testing to 93 nursing homes, where 13,443 persons were tested, and 1,619 (12%) had positive SARS-CoV-2 test results. In regression analyses among 88 of these nursing homes with a documented case before facility-wide testing occurred, each additional day between identification of the first case and completion of facility-wide testing was associated with identification of 1.3 additional cases. Among 62 facilities that could differentiate results by resident and HCP status, an estimated 1.3 HCP cases were identified for every three resident cases. Performing facility-wide testing immediately after identification of a case commonly identifies additional unrecognized cases and, therefore, might maximize the benefits of infection prevention and control interventions. In contrast, facility-wide testing in low-incidence areas without a case has a lower proportion of test positivity; strategies are needed to further optimize testing in these settings.","Hatfield, Kelly M; Reddy, Sujan C; Forsberg, Kaitlin; Korhonen, Lauren; Garner, Kelley; Gulley, Trent; James, Allison; Patil, Naveen; Bezold, Carla; Rehman, Najibah; Sievers, Marla; Schram, Benjamin; Miller, Tracy K; Howell, Molly; Youngblood, Claire; Ruegner, Hannah; Radcliffe, Rachel; Nakashima, Allyn; Torre, Michael; Donohue, Kayla; Meddaugh, Paul; Staskus, Mallory; Attell, Brandon; Biedron, Caitlin; Boersma, Peter; Epstein, Lauren; Hughes, Denise; Lyman, Meghan; Preston, Leigh E; Sanchez, Guillermo V; Tanwar, Sukarma; Thompson, Nicola D; Vallabhaneni, Snigdha; Vasquez, Amber; Jernigan, John A",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,76,24

Although testing rates declined over the past month, they remain high at 10.4 tests per 1,000 population per week. There is variability in the testing rate by jurisdiction; the rate depends on the epidemic context. The overall positivity rate for the reporting period was 0.08%. Victoria reported a positivity rate of 0.18% for this reporting period, while in all other jurisdictions the positivity rate was 0.05% or lower.",,,76,13

The protective and therapeutic potential of Fc-mediated antibody functions have been assessed for some clinically important human viruses, including HIV, hemorrhagic fever viruses and influenza virus. There is mounting evidence that influenza-specific antibodies with Fc-mediated functions, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent phagocytosis, can aid in the clearance of influenza virus infection. Recent influenza challenge studies and intravenous immunoglobulin G therapy studies in humans suggest a protective role for Fc effector functions in vivo. Broadly reactive influenza antibodies with Fc-mediated functions are prevalent in the human population and could inform the development of a universally protective influenza vaccine or therapy. In this review, we explore the utility of antibodies with Fc-mediated effector functions against viral infections with a focus on influenza virus.","Vanderven, Hillary A; Kent, Stephen J",Immunol Cell Biol,76,22

METHODS: We analyzed the electronic medical records of 405 hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in the Third Hospital of Wuhan. RESULTS: The patients' median age was 56 years, 54.1% were female, 11.4% had a history of smoking, and 10.6% had a history of drinking. All cases of COVID-19 were community-acquired. Fever (76.8%) and cough (53.3%) were the most common clinical manifestations, and circulatory system diseases were the most common comorbidities. Gastrointestinal symptoms were present in 61.2% of the patients, and 2.9% of the patients were asymptomatic. Computed tomography showed ground-glass opacities in most patients (72.6%) and consolidation in 30.9%. Lymphopenia (72.3%) and hypoproteinemia (71.6%) were observed in most patients. About 20% of patients had abnormal liver function. Patients with severe disease had significantly more prominent laboratory abnormalities, including an abnormal lymphocyte count and abnormal C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, D-dimer, and albumin levels. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 causes a variety of severe respiratory illnesses similar to those caused by SARS-CoV-1. Older age, chronic comorbidities, and laboratory abnormalities are associated with disease severity.","Zhan, Ting; Liu, Meng; Tang, Yalin; Han, Zheng; Cheng, Xueting; Deng, Junsheng; Chen, Xiaoli; Tian, Xia; Huang, Xiaodong",J Int Med Res,76,26

They serve as mediators of intercellular communication and have been implicated in the regulation of several physiological and pathological processes. Vitiligo is a depigmentation skin disease caused by progressive destruction of autologous epidermal melanocytes. Autoimmune intolerance is one of the leading theories proposed for melanocyte destruction in vitiligo via CD8+, regulatory T (Treg) and T helper 17 (Th17) cell imbalance in adaptive immunity. In this review, we investigate the association of exosomes with vitiligo and emphasize the role of exosomes in immune regulation, melanocyte-keratinocyte interactions, and melanogenesis. The exosomal pathway is necessary for the regulation of CD8+, Treg and Th17 cells in both pathological and physiological conditions. Exosomes derived under pathological conditions can influence CD8+, Treg and Th17 cell balance in the disease microenvironment, which may contribute to disruption of autoimmune tolerance in vitiligo. In addition, exosomes serve as mediators of communication between keratinocytes and melanocytes in the melanogenesis pathway and may also be involved in melanosome transport. They also regulate melanocyte survival and the protein expression of enzymes such as tyrosinase (TYR), tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TYRP1), tyrosinase-related protein-2 (TYRP2) and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) in melanogenesis, which suggests that melanin production is associated with exosomes. An improved understanding of the role of exosomes in immune regulation and melanogenesis may help to elucidate the pathogenesis of vitiligo and lead to the development of potential diagnostic markers and therapeutic options.","Wong, Pui Mun; Yang, Lili; Yang, Lingli; Wu, Huali; Li, Wen; Ma, Xin; Katayama, Ichiro; Zhang, Huimin",Autoimmun Rev,76,16

Possible complications include acute kidney injury, coagulation disorders, thoromboembolism. The development of lymphopenia and eosinopenia are laboratory indicators of COVID-19. Laboratory parameters to monitor disease progression include lactate dehydrogenase, procalcitonin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1ß, Krebs von den Lungen-6 (KL-6), and ferritin. The development of a cytokine storm and extensive chest computed tomography imaging patterns are indicators of a severe disease.

Evidence shows that besides egoistic drives, the motivation for self-isolation behaviour could be altruistic. However, the type and role of prosocial motivation in the current pandemic is underestimated and its interaction with risk exposure and psychological distress is largely unknown. Here we show that affective empathy for the most vulnerable predicts acceptance of lockdown measures. In two retrospective studies, one with a general population and one with COVID-19 positive patients, we found that (1) along with health risk exposure, affective empathy is a predictor of acceptance of lockdown measures (2) social covariates and psychological distress have no significant impact.

Nevertheless, intestinal inflammation has shown an important risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and prognosis. Therefore, we investigated the role of intestinal inflammation on the viral intestinal entry mechanisms, including ACE2, in IBD. METHODS: We collected inflamed and uninflamed mucosal biopsies from CD (n=193) and UC (n=158) patients, and 51 matched non-IBD controls for RNA sequencing, differential gene expression and co-expression analysis. Organoids from UC patients were subjected to an inflammatory mix and processed for RNA sequencing. Transmural ileal biopsies were processed for single-cell (sc) sequencing. Publicly available colonic sc-RNA sequencing data, and microarrays from tissue pre/post anti-TNF therapy, were analyzed. RESULTS: In inflamed CD ileum, ACE2 was significantly decreased compared to control ileum (p=4.6E-07), whereas colonic ACE2 was higher in inflamed colon of CD/UC compared to control (p=8.3E-03; p=1.9E-03). Sc-RNA sequencing confirmed this ACE2 dysregulation, and exclusive epithelial ACE2 expression. Network analyses highlighted HNF4A as key regulator of ileal ACE2, while pro-inflammatory cytokines and interferon regulating factors regulated colonic ACE2. Inflammatory stimuli upregulated ACE2 in UC organoids (p=1.7E-02), not in non-IBD controls (p=9.1E-01). Anti-TNF therapy restored colonic ACE2 regulation in responders. CONCLUSION: Intestinal inflammation alters SARS-CoV-2 coreceptors in the intestine, with opposing dysregulations in ileum and colon. HNF4A, an IBD susceptibility gene, seems an important upstream regulator of ACE2 in ileum, whereas interferon signaling might dominate in colon.","Verstockt, Bram; Verstockt, Sare; Abdu Rahiman, Saeed; Ke, Bo-Jun; Arnauts, Kaline; Cleynen, Isabelle; Sabino, João; Ferrante, Marc; Matteoli, Gianluca; Vermeire, Séverine",J. crohns. colitis,76,15

GPs, as first points of contact between suspected cases and the healthcare system, have assumed frontline roles in this crisis. While the prevalence of mental health problems and illnesses arising in healthcare workers (HCWs) from tertiary care settings during the COVID-19 pandemic is well-examined,1 the impact on GPs remains understudied. AIM: To describe the prevalence and predictors of anxiety, burnout, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among GPs during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN & SETTING: Survey of GPs operating in Singapore primary care clinics. METHOD: GPs completed a survey that comprised of four validated psychometric instruments. Open-ended questions asked about responders' challenges and their envisaged support. Data were analysed with multiple logistic regression with demographic data as covariates; concepts of grounded theory were used to analyse the qualitative responses. RESULTS: A total of 257 GPs participated. Fifty-five (21.4%) met the scales' criteria for anxiety, 211 (82.1%) for burnout, 68 (26.6%) for depression, and 23 (8.9%) for PTSD. Multivariate regression analysis showed working in a public primary care setting was associated with anxiety and depression. Qualitative analyses uncovered possible stressors: changes to clinical and operational practices; increased workloads; and financial difficulties. CONCLUSION: Mental health issues were found to be present in Singaporean GPs during the pandemic. Prevalence of anxiety, burnout, and depression were found to be higher than those reported pre-COVID-19. The findings also provide determinants of the issues that serve as possible foci for targeted interventions.","Lum, Alvin; Goh, Yen-Li; Wong, Kai Sheng; Seah, Junie; Teo, Gina; Ng, Jun Qiang; Abdin, Edimansyah; Hendricks, Margaret Mary; Tham, Josephine; Nan, Wang; Fung, Daniel",,76,16

Patients with CV comorbidities are typically prescribed with long-term medications. We reviewed the management of co-medications prescribed for CVDs among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. AREAS COVERED: There is no specific contraindication or caution related to COVID-19 on the use of antihypertensives unless patients develop severe hypotension from septic shock where all antihypertensives should be discontinued or severe hyperkalemia in which continuation of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors is not desired. The continuation of antiplatelet or statin is not desired when severe thrombocytopenia or severe transminitis develop, respectively. Patients with atrial fibrillation receiving oral anticoagulants, particularly those who are critically ill, should be considered for substitution to parenteral anticoagulants. EXPERT OPINION: An individualized approach to medication management among hospitalized COVID-19 patients with concurrent CVDs would seem prudent with attention paid to changes in clinical conditions and medications intended for COVID-19. The decision to modify prescribed long-term CV medications should be entailed by close follow-up to check if a revision on the decision is needed, with resumption of any long-term CV medication before discharge if it is discontinued during hospitalization for COVID-19, to ensure continuity of care.","Kow, Chia Siang; Thiruchelvam, Kaeshaelya; Hasan, Syed Shahzad",Expert Rev Cardiovasc Ther,76,2

There is limited information regarding the toxicity of NEP, however the few published reports suggest that NEP can cause serious toxic effects and sudden death. The purpose of this publication is to describe a validated LC-MS/MS method for seven synthetic cathinones (methylone, ethylone, butylone, dibutylone, &#945;-PVP, pentylone, and NEP) and to present a detailed summary regarding the presence of NEP in postmortem casework at the Miami-Dade Medical Examiner Department. Post-mortem iliac blood, serum, liver, and brain specimens were prepared by solid-phase extraction with analysis by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS-MS). Analyte linearity was established from 0.01 to 0.5 mg/L on a six-point calibration curve. A total of 101 NEP quantitations were performed using this method. Concentrations in postmortem case samples ranged from 0.01 mg/L to 2.7 mg/L. Iliac blood concentrations averaged 0.312 mg/L with a median of 0.137 mg/L (n=72) across all causes and manners of death. Approximately half of the cases were homicides in which the decedent was the victim of gunshot wounds or stabbing. Two of the three highest concentration cases of NEP (2.7 mg/L and 1.7 mg/L) involved 38-year old white males who were tasered by police prior to death.

We report findings from a survey among HCWs in three counties in Kenya. METHODS: We recruited 684 HCWs from Kilifi (rural), Busia (rural) and Nairobi (urban) counties. The serosurvey was conducted between 30th July 2020 and 4th December 2020. We tested for IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using ELISA. Assay sensitivity and specificity were 93% (95% CI 88-96%) and 99% (95% CI 98-99.5%), respectively. We adjusted prevalence estimates using Bayesian modeling to account for assay performance. RESULTS: Crude overall seroprevalence was 19.7% (135/684). After adjustment for assay performance seroprevalence was 20.8% (95% CrI 17.5-24.4%). Seroprevalence varied significantly (p<0.001) by site: 43.8% (CrI 35.8-52.2%) in Nairobi, 12.6% (CrI 8.8-17.1%) in Busia and 11.5% (CrI 7.2-17.6%) in Kilifi. In a multivariable model controlling for age, sex and site, professional cadre was not associated with differences in seroprevalence. CONCLUSION: These initial data demonstrate a high seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 among HCWs in Kenya.

As machine learning methods become more common in health care settings, it is important to ensure that these methods do not contribute to racial disparities through biased predictions or differential accuracy across racial groups. OBJECTIVE: The goal of the research was to assess a machine learning algorithm intentionally developed to minimize bias in in-hospital mortality predictions between white and nonwhite patient groups. METHODS: Bias was minimized through preprocessing of algorithm training data. We performed a retrospective analysis of electronic health record data from patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at a large academic health center between 2001 and 2012, drawing data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III database. Patients were included if they had at least 10 hours of available measurements after ICU admission, had at least one of every measurement used for model prediction, and had recorded race/ethnicity data. Bias was assessed through the equal opportunity difference. Model performance in terms of bias and accuracy was compared with the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS), the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II), and the Acute Physiologic Assessment and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE). RESULTS: The machine learning algorithm was found to be more accurate than all comparators, with a higher sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic. The machine learning algorithm was found to be unbiased (equal opportunity difference 0.016, P=.20). APACHE was also found to be unbiased (equal opportunity difference 0.019, P=.11), while SAPS II and MEWS were found to have significant bias (equal opportunity difference 0.038, P=.006 and equal opportunity difference 0.074, P<.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates there may be significant racial bias in commonly used severity scoring systems and that machine learning algorithms may reduce bias while improving on the accuracy of these methods.","Allen, Angier; Mataraso, Samson; Siefkas, Anna; Burdick, Hoyt; Braden, Gregory; Dellinger, R Phillip; McCoy, Andrea; Pellegrini, Emily; Hoffman, Jana; Green-Saxena, Abigail; Barnes, Gina; Calvert, Jacob; Das, Ritankar",JMIR Public Health Surveill,76,22

In the following, I will discuss two approaches that both aim at providing such tools, namely a policy design focus and an organizational design focus Both approaches mainly belong to the sub‐discipline Public Policy and Administration (PPA) I argue, inter alia, that the dominance of a policy design focus is highly surprising since the dependent variables (effects to be achieved) in this case tend to be located outside the core area of PPA research","Egeberg, Morten",Public Administration,76,12

The entry-point for SARS-CoV-2 is angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), which are highly expressed in the lung. Among other complications, COVID-19leads to fatal pneumonia, acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to development of cytokine storm (CS). The pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection depends on the viral load and human innate/adaptive immune response that are required for viral elimination in the first phase of COVID-19. However, an exaggerated immune response in the second phase of COVID-19 results in immune overreaction and CS-induced ALI and ARDS. Thus, in view of these considerations, we report here a series of five patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who developed ALI. In addition to the supportive therapy, the patients received doxycycline in the first week and doxycycline plus colchicine in the second week. Following sequential therapy with doxycycline and/or colchicine in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, the patients had reduction of disease severity and symptoms with better clinical and radiological outcomes. However, it is tough to confirm the link between this therapeutic combination and recovery from COVID-19 pneumonia, as it is a small case-series report. Nevertheless, this study gives a rational for large-scale prospective studies to evaluate the dual sequential effect of doxycycline and colchicine on the COVID-19 severity. This case-series illustrated that use of colchicine: doxycycline combination is linked with marked improvements in the clinical, laboratory and radiological outcomes in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.

The iminosugar Miglustat is a well-characterized drug for the treatment of rare genetic lysosome storage diseases, such as Gaucher and Niemann-Pick type C, and has also been described to be active against a variety of enveloped viruses. The activity of Miglustat is here demonstrated in the micromolar range for SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. The drug acts at the post-entry level and leads to a marked decrease of viral proteins and release of infectious viruses. The mechanism resides in the inhibitory activity toward &#945;-glucosidases that are involved in the early stages of glycoprotein N-linked oligosaccharide processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, leading to a marked decrease of the viral Spike protein. Indeed, the antiviral potential of protein glycosylation inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 is further highlighted by the low-micromolar activity of the investigational drug Celgosivir.

Although extensive research is currently ongoing worldwide to understand the molecular mechanism and disease pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2, there are still many nuances to elucidate. Therefore, developing an appropriate vaccine or therapeutic drug to combat coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is exceedingly challenging. Such scenarios require multifaceted approaches to identify suitable contenders for drugs against COVID-19. In this context, investigating natural compounds found in food, spices, and beverages can lead to the discovery of lead molecules that could be repurposed to treat COVID-19. Sixteen cucurbitacin analogues were investigated for activity against the SARS-CoV-2 main protease protein (Mpro), angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding receptor, nonstructural protein 12 (NSP12) RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), NSP13 helicase, and Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway using several relevant tools and simulated screening methods. All key proteins were found to bind efficiently only with cucurbitacin G 2-glucoside and cucurbitacin H with the lowest global energy. Further, the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) of all the cucurbitacins were analysed to explore their drug profiles. Cucurbitacin G 2-glucoside and H showed the best hits and all the analogues showed no adverse properties that would diminish their drug-likeness abilities. The encouraging results of the current study may lay the foundation for future research and development of effective measures and preventive medications against SARS-CoV-2.","Kapoor, Neha; Ghorai, Soma Mondal; Kushwaha, Prem Kumar; Shukla, Richa; Aggarwal, Charu; Bandichhor, Rakeshwar",Inform Med Unlocked,76,24

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following pandemics is a significant public health concern. We sought to provide a reliable estimate of the worldwide prevalence of PTSD after large-scale pandemics as well as associated risk factors, by a systematic review and meta-analysis. We systematically searched the MedLine, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, CNKI, WanFang, medRxiv, and bioRxiv databases to identify studies that were published from the inception up to August 23, 2020, and reported the prevalence of PTSD after pandemics including sudden acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), H1N1, Poliomyelitis, Ebola, Zika, Nipah, Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), H5N1, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A total of 88 studies were included in the analysis, with 77 having prevalence information and 70 having risk factors information. The overall pooled prevalence of post-pandemic PTSD across all populations was 22.6% (95% confidence interval (CI): 19.9-25.4%, I2: 99.7%). Healthcare workers had the highest prevalence of PTSD (26.9%; 95% CI: 20.3-33.6%), followed by infected cases (23.8%: 16.6-31.0%), and the general public (19.3%: 15.3-23.2%). However, the heterogeneity of study findings indicates that results should be interpreted cautiously. Risk factors including individual, family, and societal factors, pandemic-related factors, and specific factors in healthcare workers and patients for post-pandemic PTSD were summarized and discussed in this systematic review.

We aimed to identify demographic and clinical risk factors for testing positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) within the Oxford Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre primary care network. METHODS: We analysed routinely collected, pseudonymised data for patients in the RCGP Research and Surveillance Centre primary care sentinel network who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 between Jan 28 and April 4, 2020. We used multivariable logistic regression models with multiple imputation to identify risk factors for positive SARS-CoV-2 tests within this surveillance network. FINDINGS: We identified 3802 SARS-CoV-2 test results, of which 587 were positive. In multivariable analysis, male sex was independently associated with testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (296 [18·4%] of 1612 men vs 291 [13·3%] of 2190 women; adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1·55, 95% CI 1·27-1·89). Adults were at increased risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 compared with children, and people aged 40-64 years were at greatest risk in the multivariable model (243 [18·5%] of 1316 adults aged 40-64 years vs 23 [4·6%] of 499 children; adjusted OR 5·36, 95% CI 3·28-8·76). Compared with white people, the adjusted odds of a positive test were greater in black people (388 [15·5%] of 2497 white people vs 36 [62·1%] of 58 black people; adjusted OR 4·75, 95% CI 2·65-8·51). People living in urban areas versus rural areas (476 [26·2%] of 1816 in urban areas vs 111 [5·6%] of 1986 in rural areas; adjusted OR 4·59, 95% CI 3·57-5·90) and in more deprived areas (197 [29·5%] of 668 in most deprived vs 143 [7·7%] of 1855 in least deprived; adjusted OR 2·03, 95% CI 1·51-2·71) were more likely to test positive. People with chronic kidney disease were more likely to test positive in the adjusted analysis (68 [32·9%] of 207 with chronic kidney disease vs 519 [14·4%] of 3595 without; adjusted OR 1·91, 95% CI 1·31-2·78), but there was no significant association with other chronic conditions in that analysis. We found increased odds of a positive test among people who are obese (142 [20·9%] of 680 people with obesity vs 171 [13·2%] of 1296 normal-weight people; adjusted OR 1·41, 95% CI 1·04-1·91). Notably, active smoking was linked with decreased odds of a positive test result (47 [11·4%] of 413 active smokers vs 201 [17·9%] of 1125 non-smokers; adjusted OR 0·49, 95% CI 0·34-0·71). INTERPRETATION: A positive SARS-CoV-2 test result in this primary care cohort was associated with similar risk factors as observed for severe outcomes of COVID-19 in hospital settings, except for smoking. We provide evidence of potential sociodemographic factors associated with a positive test, including deprivation, population density, ethnicity, and chronic kidney disease.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational study. SETTING: A discrete choice experiment was conducted. Patients chose between two hypothetical non-metastatic CRPC (nmCRPC) treatments defined by six attributes: risk of fatigue, falls or fracture, cognitive impairment, hypertension, rashes as side effects to treatment and extension of time until cancer-related pain occurs. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 137 adult male patients with CRPC with no prior experience with chemotherapy and with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group status 0-1 were recruited. Patients were excluded if they participated in an investigational programme outside of routine clinical practice, had a clinically relevant medical or psychiatric condition, or diagnosis of visceral/other metastases not related to the prostate, or were otherwise deemed ineligible by the referring physician. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Relative preference weights and relative importance of the attributes was estimated by hierarchical Bayesian logistic regression. RESULTS: Among the treatment attributes, 'risk of cognitive impairment as a side effect of treatment' was the most important attribute (relative importance (RI) (95% CI): 27.47% (24.80% to 30.14%)), followed by 'extension of time until cancer-related pain occurs' (RI (95% CI): 17.87% (15.49% to 20.25%)) and the 'risk of falls or fracture' (RI (95% CI): 15.99% (14.73% to 17.25%)). The 'risk of hypertension as a side effect of treatment' (RI (95% CI): 13.77% (12.73% to 14.81%)) had similar RI as 'risk of rashes as a side effect of treatment' (RI (95% CI): 13.17% (12.15% to 14.19%)), followed by the 'risk of fatigue as a side effect of treatment' (RI (95% CI): 11.74% (10.75% to 12.73%)). CONCLUSIONS: Patients consider the risk of cognitive impairment as a side effect of treatment as the most important attribute in nmCRPC, followed by the extension of time until cancer-related pain occurs, and the risk of falls and fracture. These features should be considered in treatment decision making for nmCRPC in Japan.","Uemura, Hiroji; Matsushima, Hisashi; Yokomizo, Akira; Kobayashi, Kazuki; Arai, Gaku; Satoh, Takefumi; Grillo, Vince; Chen, Yirong; Singh, Shikha; Ledesma, Dianne Athene",BMJ Open,76,17

Considerations about the COVID-19 lockdown,18.536144,0.9439434,2021,"Hybrid complex analytics workloads typically include (i) data management tasks (joins, selections, etc. ), easily expressed using relational algebra (RA)-based languages, and (ii) complex analytics tasks (regressions, matrix decompositions, etc.), mostly expressed in linear algebra (LA) expressions. Such workloads are common in many application areas, including scientific computing, web analytics, and business recommendation. Existing solutions for evaluating hybrid analytical tasks - ranging from LA-oriented systems, to relational systems (extended to handle LA operations), to hybrid systems - either optimize data management and complex tasks separately, exploit RA properties only while leaving LA-specific optimization opportunities unexploited, or focus heavily on physical optimization, leaving semantic query optimization opportunities unexplored. Additionally, they are not able to exploit precomputed (materialized) results to avoid recomputing (part of) a given mixed (RA and/or LA) computation. In this paper, we take a major step towards filling this gap by proposing HADAD, an extensible lightweight approach for optimizing hybrid complex analytics queries, based on a common abstraction that facilitates unified reasoning: a relational model endowed with integrity constraints. Our solution can be naturally and portably applied on top of pure LA and hybrid RA-LA platforms without modifying their internals. An extensive empirical evaluation shows that HADAD yields significant performance gains on diverse workloads, ranging from LA-centered to hybrid.","Alotaibi, Rana; Cautis, Bogdan; Deutsch, Alin; Manolescu, Ioana",,76,32

Virus neutralisation tests (NTs) are the gold standard for the detection and quantification of NAbs, but they are complex and require BSL3 facilities. In contrast, surrogate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (sELISA) offer the possibility of high-throughput testing under standard laboratory safety conditions. In this study, we investigated two commercial sELISA kits (GenScript, AdipoGen) designed for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 NAbs. METHODS: 276 plasma samples were screened using commercial IgG-ELISA and NAbs titres were determined by micro-neutralisation test (micro-NT). In addition, all samples were tested in both sELISA. Sensitivity and specificity for both sELISA were determined in comparison to the micro-NT results. RESULTS: 57 % of the samples were SARS-CoV-2 NAb positive in micro-NT, while 43 % tested negative. Comparison with micro-NT results showed a sensitivity of 98.2 % and a specificity of 69.5 % for the GenScript ELISA. The AdipoGen ELISA had a sensitivity of 83.5 % and a specificity of 97.8 %. False negative results were obtained mainly on samples with low NAbs titres. CONCLUSION: Both sELISA were able to qualitatively detect NAbs in plasma samples. Sensitivity and specificity differed between sELISA with GenScript superior in sensitivity and AdipoGen superior in specificity. Both sELISA were unable to quantify NAbs, thus neither of them can completely replace conventional NTs. However, in a two-step diagnostic algorithm, AdipoGen could potentially replace NT as a subsequent confirmatory test due to its high specificity but only in settings where no exact NAbs quantification is needed.","Müller, Katharina; Girl, Philipp; von Buttlar, Heiner; Dobler, Gerhard; Wölfel, Roman",J Virol Methods,76,16

Solar Chimney Ventilator (SCV) is a type of renewable technology that is able to provide natural ventilation for the buildings. However, conventional SCV is not economical due to its low performance of ventilation. Thus, in the current study, an innovative tilted Solar Chimney Ventilator with Phase Change Material integrated with Photovoltaic technology (SCV-PV-PCM) is proposed and investigated under real unsteady transient weather condition (based on Hong Kong climate) via a validated three-dimensional numerical study. The characteristics of the SCV-PV-PCM is analyzed during the day (through different month i.e March, June, September, and December) and compared with conventional SCV-PV system. Based on the findings, the produced power and ventilation capacity of the SCV-PV-PCM is higher than those for the common SCV-PV system. Nonetheless, the system is not able to provide the appropriate ventilation power for the building through the winter due to lack of high ambient temperature and strong solar radiation. Moreover, it is concluded that using the SCV-PV-PCM in the building is most economically beneficial in the month of June by saving 2.88 $/month.","Cao, Yan Sinaga Nazaruddin Pourhedayat Samira Dizaji Hamed Sadighi",Renewable Energy,76,16

Rather, our perception of an event is influenced, over time, by information gained after the event; this is known as a postdictive effect. A recent study reported that this postdictive effect could occur even in choice. The present study sought to test whether the striking postdictive effect of choice reflects the modulation of attention on choice, by directly and systematically manipulating attention in two experiments. Specifically, Experiment 1 revealed that the robust postdictive effect of choice was almost completely eliminated when attentional bias was removed. More important, Experiment 2 demonstrated that the postdictive effect of choice could be modulated by directly manipulating participants' attention with a spatial cue, in particular, when the cue appeared at short time delays. These results suggest that choice could be considerably postdictively influenced by attention and this effect was most pronounced within a short time window wherein decision making was most likely in progress. The current study not only enables clarification of the mechanism of the newly discovered postdictive effect of choice, but also extends evidence of the modulation of attention on decision making.","Shen, Mowei; Zhou, Yiling; Chen, Luo; Zhou, Jifan; Chen, Hui",J Vis,76,13

This is even more alarming as obesity increases the COVID-19 severity. However, the relationship between obesity and COVID-19 severity is more complex than a simple association with BMI. In particular, obesity has been associated with low death rates in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, a fatal comorbidity to COVID-19, possibly due to the obesity paradox. Also, visceral adiposity could be a major risk factor for COVID-19 severity, due to its immune activation component, release of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and involvement in the cytokine storm, hypercoagulability and embolism. A poor antioxidant nutritional status also weakens the immune system, increasing inflammation and infection risk. Moreover, the COVID-19 lockdown might impact lifestyle patterns, mental health and weight bias, worsening the obesity then COIVD-19 situation. On the other hand, health care expenses and productivity loss are expected to increase during the concomitant epidemics. The co-occurrence of obesity and COVID-19 is a major challenge at both public health and economic levels that should urgently be taken into consideration. The identification of COVID-19 weight related risk factors and the development of appropriate weight management programs are needed to tackle the concomitant epidemics.","Dohet, François; Loap, Suva; Menzel, Alain; Iddir, Mohammed; Dadoun, Frédéric; Bohn, Torsten; Samouda, Hanen",Int J Vitam Nutr Res,76,33

PPARÎ³ binds to DNA as a heterodimer with retinoid X receptor and it is activated by polyunsaturated fatty acids and fatty acid derivatives, such as prostaglandins. In addition, the insulin-sensitizing thiazolidinediones, such as rosiglitazone, are potent and specific activators of PPARÎ³. PPARÎ³ is present along the hypothalamic-pituitary-testis axis and in the testis, where low levels in Leydig cells and higher levels in Sertoli cells as well as in germ cells have been found. High amounts of PPARÎ³ were reported in the normal epididymis and in the prostate, but the receptor was almost undetectable in the seminal vesicles. Interestingly, in the human and in pig, PPARÎ³ protein is highly expressed in ejaculated spermatozoa, suggesting a possible role of PPARÎ³ signaling in the regulation of sperm biology. This implies that both natural and synthetic PPARÎ³ ligands may act directly on sperm improving its performance. Given the close link between energy balance and reproduction, activation of PPARÎ³ may have promising metabolic implications in male reproductive functions. In this review, we first describe PPARÎ³ expression in different compartments of the male reproductive axis. Subsequently, we discuss the role of PPARÎ³ in both physiological and several pathological conditions related to the male fertility.","Santoro, Marta; De Amicis, Francesca; Aquila, Saveria; Bonofiglio, Daniela",Hum Reprod,76,16

The Malaysian Ministry of Education (MOE) has taken the initiative to spearhead efforts to develop the skills and potential of students in the use of digital technology. The main purpose of this study was to identify the level of digital leadership displayed by principals, the level of teachers' digital teaching practices and the elements of principals' digital leadership that predict the level of teachers' digital teaching. About 400 secondary school teachers in Hulu Langat District, Selangor were involved in this study. The findings of this study show that the level of digital leadership displayed by principals and teachers' digital teaching practice are both at a high level. However, the positive correlation between the two is moderate. Multiple regression found that only digital citizenship is a strong predictor of teachers' digital teaching. The findings show that the ability to plan and organize digital leadership programs is important and can help improve students' academic performance, despite the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. © 2021 Medicinska Naklada Zagreb.

This issue has become even more relevant since the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the necessity for minimum distances between passengers. We propose an approach that allows to dynamically navigate passengers around dangerously crowded stations to better distribute the passenger load across an entire urban public transport network. This is achieved through the introduction of new constraints into routing requests, that enable the avoidance of specific nodes in a network. These requests consider walks, bikes, metros, subways, trams and buses as possible modes of transportation. An implementation of the approach is provided in cooperation with the Munich Travel Corporation (MVG) for the city of Munich, to simulate the effects on a real city's urban traffic flow. Among other factors, the impact on the travel time was simulated given that the two major exchange points in the network were to be avoided. With an increase from 26.5 to 26.8 minutes on the average travel time, the simulation suggests that the time penalty might be worth the safety benefits.","Klinker, Jens; Selmi, Mohamed Hechem; Avezum, Mariana; Jonas, Stephan",Stud Health Technol Inform,76,20

The study was conducted in two phases. The first phase entailed the analysis of HIV care and treatment secondary data (2018-2020) from the Kenya Health Information System. In the second phase, a prospective cohort study was conducted among people living with HIV in the Kibera informal settlement. A total of 176 participants aged 18 years and above accessing HIV services at selected healthcare facilities in Kibera were randomly sampled from facility electronic medical records and followed up for three months. Socio-demographics and contact details were abstracted from the records and telephone interviews were conducted with consenting participants. Results from the retrospective review of HIV program data indicated a 56% (p < 0.000, 95% CI: 31.3%-62.8%) reduction in uptake of HIV services. Clients starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) reduced significantly by 48% (p < 0.001, 95% CI: 35.4%-77%) in hotspot counties. However, pre-exposure prophylaxis uptake increased significantly by 24% (p < 0.019, 95% CI: 4%-49%). In Kibera, 14% reported missing medications at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic because of lack of food (38%) and government measures (11%), which affected ART access; 11% did not access health facilities due to fear of contracting COVID-19, government regulations and lack of personal protective equipment. Socioeconomic factors, food insecurity and government measures affected uptake of HIV/AIDS services; hence, the need for scaling up measures to increase access to HIV/AIDS services during the onset of pandemics.","Muhula, Samuel; Opanga, Yvonne; Oramisi, Violet; Ngugi, Catherine; Ngunu, Caroline; Carter, Jane; Marita, Enock; Osur, Joachim; Memiah, Peter",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),76,16

Epidemiological data, symptoms at onset, clinical manifestations, Charlson Comorbidity Index, laboratory parameters, radiological findings and complications were considered. Patients were divided into two groups on the basis of COVID-19 severity. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to establish factors associated with the development of a moderate or severe disease. FINDINGS: A total of 171 patients (89 with mild/moderate disease, 82 with severe/critical disease), of which 61% males and a mean age (± SD) of 53.6 (± 9.7) were included. The multivariable logistic model identified age (50-65 vs 18-49; OR = 3.23 CI95% 1.42-7.37), platelet count (per 100 units of increase OR = 0.61 CI95% 0.42-0.89), c-reactive protein (CPR) (per unit of increase OR = 1.12 CI95% 1.06-1.20) as risk factors for severe or critical disease. The multivariable logistic model showed a good discriminating capacity with a C-index value of 0.76.

METHODS: We conducted an open-label study of sarilumab in severe COVID-19 pneumonia (PaO2/FiO2 <300 mm Hg) with hyperinflammation (elevated inflammatory markers and serum IL-6 levels). Sarilumab 400 mg was administered intravenously in addition to standard of care and results were compared with contemporary matched patients treated with standard of care alone. Clinical improvement, mortality, safety and predictors of response were assessed at 28 days. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients were treated with sarilumab and 28 contemporary patients receiving standard of care alone were used as controls. At day 28 of follow-up, 61% of patients treated with sarilumab experienced clinical improvement and 7% died. These findings were not significantly different from the comparison group (clinical improvement 64%, mortality 18%; p=NS). Baseline PaO2/FiO2 ratio >100 mm Hg and lung consolidation <17% at CT scan predicted clinical improvement in patients treated with sarilumab.

Inversion of chr(11) engendering NUP98-DDX10 chimeric product is sporadic and usually associated with diseases with poor prognosis (therapy-related myeloid neoplasm). To date, these cytogenetic abnormalities have been described as isolated events. CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the first case of an 80-year-old man with high-risk MDS harboring a translocation t(3,3)(q21q26) jointly with an inv(11)(p15q22) detected by fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis and conventional cytogenetic techniques. CONCLUSION: A similar pattern of acquisition was never described before in MDS. The coexistence of two independent, high-risk oncogenic, rare events in the same clone suggests that there may be a functional constraint for synergy between the two events, leading to a proliferative advantage and suggests the utility of extended genotyping in myeloid malignancies.","Monti, Valentina; Bagnoli, Filippo; Bolli, Niccolo039; Vittoria, Laura; Stioui, Sabine; Moiraghi, Maria Luisa; Pruneri, Giancarlo; Testi, Maria Adele",Tumori,76,20

The vaccine employed a novel platform, polysaccharide capsular antigen, based on the discovery that anticapsular antibody conferred protective immunity in humans. As with most new paradigms in vaccinology, it derived from important basic research from other scientific disciplines over the preceding years. The success of the first monovalent polysaccharide vaccine in nearly eliminating invasive meningococcal disease in military settings led to accelerated advances in polysaccharide vaccine development against other serogroups of meningococcus and other encapsulated pathogens. As gaps in vaccine efficacy arose over the past half-century, new vaccine technologies and approaches were developed to address the challenges. Several of these, including conjugate vaccines and ""reverse vaccinology"" led to other novel, successful vaccines that have had a significant, favorable global impact on invasive meningococcal disease.

GPCR-G protein signaling at the plasma membrane causes endothelial barrier disruption and also cross-talks with growth factor receptors to promote proinflammatory signaling. A second surge of GPCR signaling is initiated by cytoplasmic NF&#954;B activation mediated by ß-arrestins and CARMA-Bcl10-MALT1 signalosomes. Once internalized, ubiquitinated GPCRs initiate signaling from endosomes via assembly of the transforming growth factor-ß-activated kinase binding protein-1 (TAB1)-TAB2-p38 MAPK complex to promote vascular inflammation.

Our aims were to evaluate the presence of acute pancreatitis in COVID-19 patients and to assess the frequency of pancreatic hyperenzymemia. METHODS: From April 1, 2020, to April 30, 2020, 110 consecutive patients (69 males, 41 females; mean age, 63.0 years; range, 24-93 years) met these criteria and were enrolled in the study. The clinical data and serum activity of pancreatic amylase and lipase were assayed in all patients using commercially available kits. RESULTS: None of the patients studied developed clinical signs or morphological alterations compatible with acute pancreatitis. However, it was found that 24.5% of the patients had amylase values above 53 IU/L and 16.4% had lipase values above 300 IU/L. Only 1 patient (0.9%) had both amylase and lipase values in excess of 3-fold the upper normal limit without clinical signs of pancreatitis. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of pancreatic hyperenzymemia in a patient with COVID-19 requires the management of these patients be guided by clinical evaluation and not merely by evaluation of the biochemical results.","Pezzilli, Raffaele; Centanni, Stefano; Mondoni, Michele; Rinaldo, Rocco F; Davì, Matteo; Stefanelli, Rossana; d039,; Eril, Gianvico Melzi; Barassi, Alessandra",Pancreas,76,1

During this ""quarantine"" period, it is important to understand the volume and types of emergency/trauma radiology cases to better prepare for the continuing and future pandemics. This study demonstrates new trends in pathologies and an overall increase in positive exams. METHODS: A retrospective review of emergency department's imaging during the initial two weeks of this state's quarantine period, 3/23/2020-4/5/2020 was compared to similar dates of the previous year (""pre-quarantine"" period), 3/25/2019-4/7/2019. One thousand emergency radiology and 991 trauma cases were evaluated. Of the emergency radiology cases 500 studies from each period were assessed, and from the trauma cases, 783 cases from pre-quarantine and 315 from the quarantine period were examined. Chi-square analysis was performed to assess for statistical significance. RESULTS: Overall there were 43.0% fewer emergency radiology studies performed during the quarantine period (n = 4530) compared to pre-quarantine period (n = 2585). Additionally, the number of positive cases was significantly higher (P = 0.0001) during the quarantine period (43.0%) compared to the pre-quarantine period (30.2%). Several trends in types of trauma were observed, including a significant increase in domestic violence during the quarantine period (P = 0.0081). DISCUSSION: Different volumes and types of emergency/trauma imaging cases were observed during the recent quarantine period. Findings may assist emergency radiology departments to plan for future pandemics or COVID-19 resurgences by offering evidence of the types and volume of emergency radiology cases one might expect.","Jang, Benjamin; Mezrich, Jonathan L",Clin Imaging,76,3

Though a number of vaccines have recently been approved against the virus, availability remains a big challenge, and also acceptance by most people has become a big debate. This review discusses possible/ proposed natural product remedies and some major conventional treatment options used to manage the infection and, safety concerns on the use of unproven or unapproved health products against COVID-19. An extensive literature review indicated that the influx of unproven and unapproved health products in the global market are on the rise, leading to various forms of self- medication. To this effect, there have been warnings by the United States Food and Drug Administration and the World Health Organisation against the use of such products. Conventional drugs such as remdesivir, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and dexamethasone are the major proposed drugs that are currently undergoing clinical trials for the management of this disease. Efforts are being made globally in the search for possible therapeutics which may be the best way to eradicating this disease. Some countries have approved the use of natural products in the management of COVID-19, despite little or no clinical evidence on their efficacy and safety. Natural products may hold a great potential in the fight against COVID-19 but without detailed clinical trials, their potency against the virus and their safe use cannot be established. To attain this goal, extensive research followed by clinical studies are needed. Collaborative efforts between researchers, clinicians, governments and traditional medicinal practitioners in the search and development of safe and effective therapeutics from natural products for the treatment of COVID-19 could be a potential option.","Omokhua-Uyi, Aitebiremen Gift; Van Staden, Johannes",,76,20

METHODS: a retrospective observational analytical descriptive study was carried out on the population attended in the Emergency Services of two general hospitals in a public Health Care Department in Spain. Data were studied from the two-months confinement period in 2020 and compared with the same period in 2018 and 2019. RESULTS: A total of 56,332 emergency cases were included. There was a decrease in the total number of patients attended along the confinement period compared to the same period in the two previous years. Fracture cases decreased by 58,8% in the confinement period (330 in 2020; 715 in 2018 and 884 in 2019). Also there was a 37,6% reduction in fractures needing admission or surgery. The percentage distribution of the types of fractures that required admission resulted in a decrease in upper and lower limb fractures, whereas the number of vertebral and hip fractures remained unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: both the reduction of fractures attended in the emergency department and the maintenance of the number of hip fractures must be taken into account when establishing contingency plans in the event of a pandemic situation in order to properly plan human resources and materials.","Miranda, Ignacio; Sangüesa-Nebot, María José; González, Antonio; Doménech, Julio",J. orthop. sci,76,5

Patients who had recovered from mild and severe forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection in an Academic Spanish hospital (March 12-May 2, 2020), were tested for total anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 test; Roche Diagnostics GmbH). The non-seropositive status (seropositive failure) incidence (95% CI) was determined. Associations were tested by multiple logistic regression in a global cohort and severe pneumonia subpopulation. Of 435 patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2, a serological test was carried out in 325: 210 (64.6%) had severe pneumonia (hospitalized patients), 51 (15.7%) non-severe pneumonia (managed as outpatients), and 64 (19.7%) mild cases without pneumonia. After a median (IQR) of 76 days (70-83) from symptom onset, antibody responses may not consistently develop or reach levels sufficient to be detectable by antibody tests (non-seropositive incidence) in 6.9% (95% CI, 4.4-10.6) and 20.3% (95% CI, 12.2-31.7) of patients with and without pneumonia, respectively. Baseline independent predictors of seropositive failure were higher leukocytes and fewer days of symptoms before admission, while low glomerular filtrate and fever seem associated with serologic response. Age, comorbidity or immunosuppressive therapies (corticosteroids, tocilizumab) did not influence antibody response. In the medium-term, SARS-CoV-2 seropositive failure is not infrequent in COVID-19 recovered patients. Age, comorbidity or immunosuppressive therapies did not influence antibody response.","Moreno-Pérez, Oscar; Ramos, Jose Manuel; Gimeno, Adelina; Rodríguez, Juan Carlos; Andres, Mariano; Leon-Ramirez, Jose-Manuel; Valero, Beatriz; Llorens, Pere; Boix, Vicente; Gil, Joan; Merino, Esperanza",J Med Virol,76,16

We aim to report the distribution of cases, prevalence, and clinical, radiological, and laboratory signs and outcomes of COVID-19 in paediatric patients. Moreover, we intend to evaluate neonatal clinical outcomes. Hence, our age range of interest is 0 to 19 years. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted using the Medline database to identify papers published between 1 December 2019 and 9 April 2020 on COVID-19. RESULTS: The search identified 27 relevant scientific papers and letters. The review showed that the prevalence of COVID-19 in the paediatric population accounts for a small percentage of patients, whose clinical signs and symptoms are often milder than those of adults. Despite better prognosis and low mortality in children, the disease can progress to severe pneumonia in some cases, especially in the presence of co-morbidities. Children are likely to become a hidden source of infection because of their atypical presentation, and they may play a role in community transmission, leading to unfavourable outcomes. There is little evidence about intrauterine vertical transmission. As no vaccine or specific antiviral is currently available, management plans include supportive treatment. CONCLUSION: As compared with that in adults, the presentation of COVID-19 in children is mild and has a better prognosis. Sufficient evidence regarding the probability of intrauterine vertical transmission could not be found, and further studies need to be conducted to establish this relationship.","Jahangir, M; Nawaz, M; Nanjiani, D; Siddiqui, M S",Hong Kong med. j,76,24

A decisive step in preventing or slowing the outbreak is the use of mobility interventions, such as government stay-at-home orders. However, different socio-demographic groups might have different responses to these orders and regulations. In this paper, we attempt to fill the current gap in the literature by examining how different communities with different age groups performed social distancing by following orders such as the national emergency declaration on March 13, as well as how fast they started changing their behavior after the regulations were imposed. For this purpose, we calculated the behavior changes of people in different mobility metrics, such as percentage of people staying home during the study period (March, April, and May 2020), in different age groups in comparison to the days before the pandemic (January and February 2020), by utilizing anonymized and privacy-protected mobile device data. Our study indicates that senior communities outperformed younger communities in terms of their behavior change.

The data were collected from 224 Japanese participants (98 females; mean age = 46.56, SD = 13.41) in July 2020. The measures used in this study included the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S), Short Grit Scale, and Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale 21 (DASS). The results of mediation analyses revealed significant indirect effects of consistency of interest, a major component of grit, on psychological distress (depression: estimate = .042; 95% CI: [.008, .088], anxiety: estimate = .021; 95% CI: [.001, .050], and stress: estimate = .030; 95% CI: [.004, .066]); we also found non-significant indirect effects of perseverance of effort, another major component of grit, on psychological distress. These results suggest that consistency of interest buffers the psychological distress induced by fear of COVID-19. Based on these results, it can be concluded that individuals with higher consistency of interest are less likely to experience worsening of their mental health, even if they experience fear of COVID-19 during the pandemic.","Masuyama, Akihiro; Kubo, Takahiro; Sugawara, Daichi; Yuta, Chishima",Int J Ment Health Addict,76,19

Video streaming uses a data-driven modified mesh architecture which supports dynamic fanout. The whiteboard may be used in synchronization with an active video streaming session. It is shared by both the presenter and the participants in the audience for graphic illustrations during the lecture. P2P-PS provides an important feature called {\em ask doubt} that allows any participant to send a query (or a doubt) during an active presentation session. The query is disseminated to all other peers by preserving the causality between {\em ask doubt} and its resolution. A buffered approach is employed to boost the performance of the whiteboard. The simulations experiments were performed with over 1000 peer nodes on Emulab using 200 physical nodes. The results show that the proposed overlay eventually stabilizes even in the presence of a churning rate of up to 30\%. The maximum path length being just six hops.

A server instance protected by shibboleth authentication enabled students and academic staff access remotely even copyright-protected works for the period of the lockdown. Through brief observation of user behaviour in this server instance, the paper explores accessed titles, especially with focus on their copyright status. Design/methodology/approach: Library usage was observed in a branch of a DL, which enabled remote access to copyright-protected documents. Data were obtained from Google Analytics and access logs enriched with metadata. Findings: Academic DL users overwhelmingly preferred titles that are copyright protected, monographs in particular. Their spectrum of interests was wide, and thus, mass digitisation is essential. Originality/value: The paper presents a solution to provide free remote access to library users during closure on a national level. The case study reveals the needs and interests of DL users via a brief analysis of accessed titles and gives grounds for further changes towards a more open remote access DL model, which would be possible within the current copyright restrictions.","Pokorná, Lenka; Indrák, Michal; Grman, Maroš; Stepanovsky, Frantisek; Smetánková, Martina",Digit.

METHODS: The widespread testing implemented in the United States for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has led to a significant shortage of testing supplies and therefore has become a major impediment to the public health response. To date, several institutions have implemented sample pooling, but publications documenting these experiences are sparse. Nasal and nasopharyngeal samples collected from low-positivity (<5%) areas were tested in pools of five on the Roche cobas 6800 analyzer system. Routine SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR turnaround times between sample collection to result reporting were monitored and compared before and after sample pooling implementation. RESULTS: A total of 4,131 sample pools were tested over a 3-month period (during which 39,770 RT-PCR results were reported from the Roche system), allowing our laboratory to save 13,824 tests, equivalent to a conservation rate of 35%. A 48-hour or less turnaround time was generally maintained throughout the pooling period. CONCLUSIONS: Sample pooling offers a viable means to mitigate shortfalls of PCR testing supplies in the ongoing pandemic without significantly compromising overall turnaround times.","Chan, Clarence W; Kwon, Seunghyug; Matushek, Scott M; Ciaglia, Carol; Bethel, Cindy; Beavis, Kathleen G",Am. j. clin. pathol,76,29

Presently, there are a number of point-of-care tests for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) screening. However, the reliability of these test kits is poorly documented and hence, needs to be ascertained. This study was therefore designed to determine the sensitivity and specificity of two serological test kits for COVID-19 screening with the view to providing necessary information on the suitability of their deployment as routine test kits for SARS-CoV-2 in Nigeria. Forty-seven (47) asymptomatic adults who had been tested for SARS-CoV-2 with the real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain reaction (RT-PCR) were enrolled into this study. Blood samples were obtained for qualitative determination of serum IgM and IgG antibodies to the S-antigen of SARS-CoV-2 using a commercially available IgM and IgG Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The association between the test kits (ELISA and RDT) and PCR in diagnosing COVID-19 was determined using the Fisher's Exact test at P&lt;0.05. The sensitivity and specificity of the test kits were determined using ROC while the Positive Predictive Value (PPV), Negative Predictive Value (NPV), Positive Likelihood Ratio (PLR), Negative Likelihood Ratio (NLR), Diagnostic Odds Ratio (DOR) and accuracy were calculated as appropriate. Twenty-eight (59.6%) of the study participants had positive PCR result. ELISA and RDT identified 20 (42.6%) and 13 (27.7%) participants respectively as having anti- SARS COV-2 specific antibodies. ELISA had a better sensitivity performance, NPV, PLR, DOR and accuracy than the RDT while the RDT had a better specificity performance than ELISA. The proportion of participants with anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibody identified using ELISA was significantly higher compared with RDT. In contrast, the proportion of participants with positive anti- SARS COV-2 IgG antibody identified using RDT was significantly higher compared with ELISA. ELISA has a better sensitivity for detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike-protein specific antibodies than the RDT. However, combination of RDT and ELISA for the detection of anti-SARS-COV-2 antibodies might be useful for population COVID-19 screening.","Arinola, O. G.; Edem, V. F.; Rahamon, S. K.; Yaqub, S.

Operating guidelines, additional professional development and real-time evaluation were significant gaps, which hindered systems practice. For inexperienced systems thinkers, these limitations encouraged them to implement programs, rather than interact with the seemingly ambiguous systems methods. Conclusions: HTV was an innovative attempt to strengthen health promotion infrastructure, creating a common language and shared understanding of prevention system requirements. However, the model was inadequate for HTV to achieve population-level reductions in chronic disease as system oversight was missing, as was an intervention delivery focus. Clarity was needed to define the systems practice that HTV was seeking to achieve. Importantly, the HTV prevention system needed to be understood as complex and adaptive, and not prioritized as individual parts.","Bensberg, Monica; Joyce, Andrew; Wilson, Erin",Int J Environ Res Public Health,76,0

Current influenza virus vaccine modalities primarily induce antibodies directed towards the highly variable head domain of the hemagglutinin protein on the virus surface. Such antibodies are often strain-specific, meaning limited cross-protection against divergent influenza viruses is induced, resulting in poor vaccine efficacy. To attempt to counteract this, yearly influenza vaccination with updated formulations containing antigens from more recently circulating viruses is required. This is an expensive and time-consuming exercise, and the constant arms race between host immunity and virus evolution presents an ongoing challenge for effective vaccine development. Furthermore, there exists the constant pandemic threat of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses with high fatality rates (~30–50%) or the emergence of new, pathogenic reassortants. Current vaccines would likely offer little to no protection from such viruses in the event of an epidemic or pandemic. This highlights the urgent need for improved influenza virus vaccines capable of providing long-lasting, robust protection from both seasonal influenza virus infections as well as potential pandemic threats. In this narrative review, we examine the next generation of influenza virus vaccines for human use and the steps being taken to achieve universal protection.","McMillan, Christopher L.D.; Young, Paul R.; Watterson, Daniel; Chappell, Keith J.",Vaccines (Basel),76,1

BACKGROUND: The COVID‐19 pandemic has affected the whole world, including Turkey where this study was conducted. Nurses are among healthcare professionals who are intensively working at the forefront during this pandemic. Countries are implementing many policies to fight this pandemic. Turkey also has implemented protective measures related to travel, sports, and cultural activities and has prohibited social meetings. METHOD: The study was conducted with 26 nurses working in COVID‐19 clinics of two hospitals in eastern Turkey between May and July 2020 using a qualitative descriptive design. FINDINGS: Nurses who had children longed for their children and worried about them. They were afraid of getting infected with the disease and transmitting it. Based on content analysis, the themes of the study were determined as follows: (1) longing (longing for children and longing for the pre‐pandemic period), (2) fear (fear of transmitting the disease and fear of death), (3) despair, (4) concern (concern resulting from working in a different clinic, concern resulting from lack of knowledge, and concern resulting from lack of protective equipment), and (5) professional responsibility (professional awareness and love for the profession). CONCLUSION: Nurses were away from their families for a long time because of the fear of getting infected with COVID‐19 and transmitting it. They longed for their children and experienced desperation, fear, and anxiety. They loved their profession and were not considering quitting their profession. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING AND HEALTH POLICY: Nurses working in COVID‐19 units wear protective equipment and work for a long time under difficult conditions. In addition, nurses who have children are separated from their children because of the fear of transmitting COVID‐19. Therefore, nurses caring for COVID‐19 patients should alternately be replaced by nurses working in other services. They should be given the opportunity to rest and spend time with their loved ones if they are not carriers of COVID‐19.","Coşkun Şimşek, Didem; Günay, Ulviye",Int Nurs Rev,76,1

Strategies are urgently needed to reduce transmission in these high-risk populations. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate COVID-19 transmission in nursing homes associated with contact-targeted interventions and testing. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This decision analytical modeling study developed an agent-based susceptible–exposed–infectious (asymptomatic/symptomatic)–recovered model between July and September 2020 to examine SARS-CoV-2 transmission in nursing homes. Residents and staff of a simulated nursing home with 100 residents and 100 staff split among 3 shifts were modeled individually; residents were split into 2 cohorts based on COVID-19 diagnosis. Data were analyzed from September to October 2020. EXPOSURES: In the resident cohorting intervention, residents who had recovered from COVID-19 were moved back from the COVID-19 (ie, infected with SARS-CoV-2) cohort to the non–COVID-19 (ie, susceptible and uninfected with SARS-CoV-2) cohort. In the immunity-based staffing intervention, staff who had recovered from COVID-19 were assumed to have protective immunity and were assigned to work in the non–COVID-19 cohort, while susceptible staff worked in the COVID-19 cohort and were assumed to have high levels of protection from personal protective equipment. These interventions aimed to reduce the fraction of people’s contacts that were presumed susceptible (and therefore potentially infected) and replaced them with recovered (immune) contacts. A secondary aim of was to evaluate cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections associated with 2 types of screening tests (ie, rapid antigen testing and polymerase chain reaction [PCR] testing) conducted with varying frequency. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Estimated cumulative incidence proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infection after 3 months. RESULTS: Among the simulated cohort of 100 residents and 100 staff members, frequency and type of testing were associated with smaller outbreaks than the cohorting and staffing interventions. The testing strategy associated with the greatest estimated reduction in infections was daily antigen testing, which reduced the mean cumulative incidence proportion by 49% in absence of contact-targeted interventions. Under all screening testing strategies, the resident cohorting intervention and the immunity-based staffing intervention were associated with reducing the final estimated size of the outbreak among residents, with the immunity-based staffing intervention reducing it more (eg, by 19% in the absence of testing) than the resident cohorting intervention (eg, by 8% in the absence of testing). The estimated reduction in transmission associated with these interventions among staff varied by testing strategy and community prevalence. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that increasing the frequency of screening testing of all residents and staff, or even staff alone, in nursing homes may reduce outbreaks in this high-risk setting. Immunity-based staffing may further reduce spread at little or no additional cost and becomes particularly important when daily testing is not feasible.","Holmdahl, Inga; Kahn, Rebecca; Hay, James A.; Buckee, Caroline O.; Mina, Michael J.",JAMA Netw Open,76,1

METHODS: This prospective investigation evaluated travelers returning from countries with endemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009, and who were seen in our department at the onset of the outbreak (April–July 2009). Patients were included if they presented with signs of RTI that occurred during travel or less than 7 days after return from overseas travel. Patients were evaluated for microbial agents with RespiFinder plus assay, and throat culture according to clinical presentation. RESULTS: A total of 113 travelers (M/F ratio 1.2:1; mean age 39 y) were included. They were mainly tourists (n = 50; 44.2%) mostly returning from North America (n = 65; 58%) and Mexico (n = 21; 18.5%). The median duration of travel was 23 days (range 2–540 d). The median lag time between return and onset of illness was 0.2 days (range 10 d prior to 7 d after). The main clinical presentation of RTI was influenza‐like illness (n = 76; 67.3%). Among the 99 microbiologically evaluated patients, a pathogen was found by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or throat culture in 65 patients (65.6%). The main etiological agents were influenza A(H1N1) 2009 (18%), influenza viruses (14%), and rhinovirus (20%). A univariate analysis was unable to show variables associated with influenza A(H1N1) 2009, whereas rhinorrhea was associated with viruses other than influenza (p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Despite the A(H1N1) 2009 influenza pandemic, rhinovirus and other influenza viruses were also frequent causes of RTI in overseas travelers.

However, patients with type A acute aortic dissection (AAD) during pregnancy can seriously endanger the health of either the mother or fetus that requires emergency surgical treatment without the test for COVID-19. CASE SUMMARY: A 38-year-old woman without Marfan syndrome was admitted to the hospital because of chest pain in the 34(th) week of gestation. She has diagnosed as having a Stanford type-A AAD involving an aortic arch and descending aorta via aortic computed tomographic angiography. The patient was transferred to the isolated negative pressure operating room in one hour and underwent cesarean delivery and ascending aorta replacement. All medical staff adopted third-level medical protection measures throughout the patient transfer and surgical procedure. After surgery, the patient was transferred to the isolated negative pressure intensive care unit ward. The nucleic acid test and anti-COVID-19 immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgM were performed and were negative. The patient and infant were discharged without complication nine days later and recovered uneventfully. CONCLUSION: The results indicated that the procedure that we used is feasible in patients with a combined cesarean delivery and surgery for Stanford type-A AAD during the COVID-19 outbreak, which was mainly attributed to rapid multidisciplinary consultation, collaboration, and quick decision-making.","Liu, Li-Wei; Luo, Lan; Li, Lu; Li, Yu; Jin, Mu; Zhu, Jun-Ming",World J Clin Cases,76,1

METHODS: A cross-sectional study among medical and health sciences students from the Fujian Medical University in Fuzhou, China, was conducted between April 6-22, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 2086 completed responses were received. Multivariable analyses demonstrated that four constructs of the Health Belief Model (HBM)—higher perception of susceptibility (odds ratio [OR] 1.44; 95% CI 1.07-1.94), severity (OR 1.32; 95% CI 1.10-1.59), self-efficacy (OR 1.61; 95% CI 1.21-2.15), and perceived control or intention to carry out prevention measures (OR 1.32; 95% CI 1.09-1.59)—were significantly associated with a higher mass media exposure score, whereas only three constructs—higher perception of severity (OR 1.43; 95% CI 1.19-1.72), self-efficacy (OR 1.85; 95% CI 1.38-2.48), and perceived control or intention to carry out prevention measures (OR 1.32; 95% CI 1.08-1.58)—were significantly associated with a higher social media exposure score. Lower emotional consequences and barriers to carry out prevention measures were also significantly associated with greater mass and social media exposure. Our findings on anxiety levels revealed that 38.1% (n=795; 95% CI 36.0-40.2) of respondents reported moderate-to-severe anxiety.

There is limited data describing the course of liver injury occurrence in patients with different disease severity, and the causes and risk factors are unknown. We aim to investigate the incidence, characteristics, risk factors, and clinical outcomes of liver injury in patients with COVID-19. Methods: This retrospective observational study was conducted in three hospitals (Zhejiang, China). From January 19, 2020 to February 20, 2020, patients confirmed with COVID-19 (≥18 years) and without liver injury were enrolled and divided into non-critically ill and critically ill groups. The incidence and characteristics of liver injury were compared between the two groups. Demographics, clinical characteristics, treatments, and treatment outcomes between patients with or without liver injury were compared within each group. The multivariable logistic regression model was used to explore the risk factors for liver injury. Results: The mean age of 131 enrolled patients was 51.2 years (standard deviation [SD]: 16.1 years), and 70 (53.4%) patients were male. A total of 76 patients developed liver injury (mild, 40.5%; moderate, 15.3%; severe, 2.3%) with a median occurrence time of 10.0 days. Critically ill patients had higher and earlier occurrence (81.5 vs. 51.9%, 12.0 vs. 5.0 days; p < 0.001), greater injury severity (p < 0.001), and slower recovery (50.0 vs. 61.1%) of liver function than non-critically ill patients. Multivariable regression showed that the number of concomitant medications (odds ratio [OR]: 1.12, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.05–1.21) and the combination treatment of lopinavir/ritonavir and arbidol (OR: 3.58, 95% CI: 1.44–9.52) were risk factors for liver injury in non-critically ill patients. The metabolism of arbidol can be significantly inhibited by lopinavir/ritonavir in vitro (p < 0.005), which may be the underlying cause of drug-related liver injury. Liver injury was related to increased length of hospital stay (mean difference [MD]: 3.2, 95% CI: 1.3–5.2) and viral shedding duration (MD: 3.0, 95% CI: 1.0–4.9). Conclusions: Critically ill patients with COVID-19 suffered earlier occurrence, greater injury severity, and slower recovery from liver injury than non-critically ill patients. Drug factors were related to liver injury in non-critically ill patients. Liver injury was related to prolonged hospital stay and viral shedding duration in patients with COVID-19.

In particular, pulmonary infections acquired in the community, and pneumonias arising in the hospital setting, represent a major medical and economic problem and thus a continuous challenge to health care. For the radiologist, it is important to understand that community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and nosocomial pneumonia (NP) share a number of characteristics, but should, in many respects be regarded as separate entities. CAP and NP arise in different populations, host different spectra of causative pathogens, and pose different challenges to both the clinician and the radiologist. CAP is generally seen in outpatients, is most frequently caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Chlamydia, and its radiologic diagnosis is relatively straightforward. NP, in contrast, develops in the hospital setting, is commonly caused by gram-negative bacteria, and may generate substantial problems for the radiologist. Overall, both for CAP and NP, imaging is an integral component of the diagnosis, important for classification and differential diagnosis, and helpful for follow-up.","Herold, Christian J.; Sailer, Johannes G.",European radiology,76,33

Accurate estimation of this quantity requires distinguishing cases arising from local transmission from those imported from elsewhere. Realistically, we can expect identification of cases as local or imported to be imperfect. We study the propagation of such errors in estimation of the local time-varying reproduction number. In addition, we propose a Bayesian framework for estimation of the true local time-varying reproduction number when identification errors exist. And we illustrate the practical performance of our estimator through simulation studies and with outbreaks of COVID-19 in Hong Kong and Victoria, Australia.","Li, Wenrui; Bulekova, Katia; Gregor, Brian; White, Laura F.; Kolaczyk, Eric D.",medRxiv,76,2

In this study, we explored how emotional intelligence can, directly and indirectly, influence academic performance, with academic social networking sites (ASNS) as a mediator. METHODS: A survey questionnaire comprising 42 items was used to collect data on emotional intelligence, ASNS, and academic performance. In total, 305 undergraduate university students participated in the study. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (SmartPLS-SEM 3.2.2) was used to measure the effects of emotional intelligence and ASNS. RESULTS: Two dimensions of emotional intelligence, namely, self-regulation and self-awareness, showed significant positive effects on academic performance. Similarly, emotional intelligence and subscales of self-regulation, self-awareness and social skills showed a positive effect on ASNS. Likewise, ASNS showed a significant positive effect on academic performance. Looking at indirect influence, three dimensions of emotional intelligence, including self-regulation, self-awareness, and social skills, exerted a significant positive indirect influence on academic performance. Thus, outcomes of this study indicate that ASNS worked as a mediator between emotional intelligence and academic performance. CONCLUSION: Emotional intelligence contributes directly and indirectly to increased academic performance. Together with emotional intelligence, ASNS played a positive and significant role in nurturing academic performance during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Iqbal, Javed; Qureshi, Naima; Ashraf, Muhammad Azeem; Rasool, Samma Faiz; Asghar, Muhammad Zaheer",Psychol Res Behav Manag,76,16

Here we evaluated the role of alveolar macrophages (AM) in modulating the adaptive immune response and subsequent disease. Depletion of AM using clodronate liposomes administered prior to MHV-1 infection was associated with a significant amelioration of MHV-1-induced morbidity and mortality. AM depletion resulted in a decreased number of virus-specific CD4 T cells in the lung airways. In addition, a significant increase in the frequency and total number of Tregs in the lung tissue and lung airways was observed following MHV-1 infection in mice depleted of AM.

So far, no study has analyzed the somatosensory changes of the skin after the stimulation of different underlying fasciae. The current study aimed to investigate heterotopic somatosensory crosstalk between deep tissue (muscle or fascia) and superficial tissue (skin) using two established models of deep tissue pain (namely focal high frequency electrical stimulation (HFS) (100 pulses of constant current electrical stimulation at 10× detection threshold) or the injection of hypertonic saline in stimulus locations as verified using ultrasound). In a methodological pilot experiment in the TLF, different injection volumes of hypertonic saline (50–800 µL) revealed that small injection volumes were most suitable, as they elicited sufficient pain but avoided the complication of the numbing pinprick sensitivity encountered after the injection of a very large volume (800 µL), particularly following muscle injections. The testing of fascia at different body sites revealed that 100 µL of hypertonic saline in the temporal fascia and TLF elicited significant pinprick hyperalgesia in the overlying skin (–26.2% and –23.5% adjusted threshold reduction, p < 0.001 and p < 0.05, respectively), but not the trapezius fascia or iliotibial band. Notably, both estimates of hyperalgesia were significantly correlated (r = 0.61, p < 0.005). Comprehensive somatosensory testing (DFNS standard) revealed that no test parameter was changed significantly following electrical HFS. The experiments demonstrated that fascia stimulation at a sufficient stimulus intensity elicited significant across-tissue facilitation to pinprick stimulation (referred hyperalgesia), a hallmark sign of nociceptive central sensitization.","Magerl, Walter; Thalacker, Emanuela; Vogel, Simon; Schleip, Robert; Klein, Thomas; Treede, Rolf-Detlef; Schilder, Andreas",Life (Basel),76,1

With controlling both diet and exercise being the main approaches to manage the energy metabolism balance, a high-fat (HF) diet is of particular importance. Indeed, lipids have a low satiety potential but a high caloric density. Thus, focusing on pharmacologically targetable pathways remains an approach with promising therapeutic potential. Within this context, trefoil factor family member 2 (Tff2) has been characterized as specifically induced by HF diet rather than low-fat diet. TFF2 has also been linked to diverse neurological mechanisms and metabolic patterns suggesting its role in energy balance. The hypothesis is that TFF2 would be a HF diet-induced signal that regulates metabolism with a focus on lipids. Within this review, we put the spotlight on key findings highlighting this line of thought. Importantly, the hypothetical mechanisms pointed highlight TFF2 as an important contributor to obesity development via increasing lipids intestinal absorption and anabolism. Therefore, an outlook for future experimental activities and evaluation of the therapeutic potential of TFF2 inhibition is given. Indeed, its knockdown or downregulation would contribute to an antiobesity phenotype. We believe this work represents an addition to our understanding of the lipidic molecular implications in obesity, which will contribute to develop therapies aiming to manage the lipidic metabolic pathways including the absorption, storage and metabolism via targeting TFF2-related pathways.

In particular, lateral flow immunoassay devices are easy to produce, scale, distribute, and use; however, they are unable to provide quantitative information. To enable quantitative analysis of lateral flow immunoassay device results, microgating technology was used to develop an innovative spectrochip that can be integrated into a portable, palm-sized device that was capable of capturing high-resolution reflectance spectrum data for quantitative immunoassay diagnostics. Using predefined spiked concentrations of recombinant anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG), this spectrochip-coupled immunoassay provided extraordinary sensitivity, with a detection limit as low as 186 pg/mL. Furthermore, this platform enabled the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in all PCR-confirmed patients as early as day 3 after symptom onset, including two patients whose spectrochip tests would be regarded as negative for COVID-19 using a direct visual read-out without spectral analysis. Therefore, the quantitative lateral flow immunoassay with an exceptionally low detection limit for SARS-CoV-2 is of value.

In general, social presence research has mainly focused on uni-directional aspects of each exchanged message, not on bidirectional interactions. Our primary purpose is to introduce such bidirectional evaluation by quantifying the degree of social presence with a few statistical measures. To this end, we developed a software called “TypeTrace” that records all keystrokes of online chat interactants and reenacts their typing actions and analyzed the results from different chat conditions, mainly focusing on the characterization of bi-directional interactions. We also compared the chat interaction patterns with the patterns from phone call datasets to investigate the difference of live communication in different media. The hypothesis of the experiment was that either richness or concurrency of communication is important for organizing social presence. Richness is defined by the variety of information at a time in communication and the concurrency is the number of temporal thread being processed at the same time. Our results show that when we merely increase the richness of information by presenting the typing process, the cognition of others' presence does not significantly increase. However, when the information concurrency is augmented by introducing the transmission of realtime text, we found that the transfer entropy between the interactants becomes considerably higher, and the social presence and emotional arousal, intimacy increased. High transfer entropy was also observed in the phone call dataset. This result shows that the mere augmentation of information richness does not necessarily lead to increased social presence, and concurrent communication is another critical factor for fostering vivid conversation in digital environments.","Kojima, Hiroki; Chen, Dominique; Oka, Mizuki; Ikegami, Takashi",Front Psychol,76,1

In Italy, since the beginning of the pandemic, colorectal cancer (CRC) screening programs have been forcefully suspended. We aimed to evaluate whether screening procedure delays can affect the outcomes of CRC screening. Methods We built a procedural model considering delays in the time to colonoscopy and estimating the effect on mortality due to up-stage migration of patients. The number of expected CRC cases was computed by using the data of the Italian screened population. Estimates of the effects of delay to colonoscopy on CRC stage, and of stage on mortality were assessed by a meta-analytic approach. Results With a delay of 0-3 months, 74% of CRC is expected to be stage I-II, while with a delay of 4-6 months there would be a 2%-increase for stage I-II and a concomitant decrease for stage III-IV (p=0.068). Compared to baseline (0-3-months), moderate (7-12-months) and long (>12-months) delays would lead to a significant increase in advanced CRC (from 26% to 29% and 33%, respectively; p=0.008 and p<0.001, respectively). We estimated a significant increase in the total number of deaths (+12.0%) when moving from a 0-3-months to a >12-month delay (p=0.005), and a significant change in mortality distribution by stage when comparing the baseline with the >12-months (p<0.001). Conclusions Screening delays beyond 4-6 months would significantly increase advanced CRC cases, and also mortality if lasting beyond 12 months. Our data highlight the need to reorganize efforts against high-impact diseases such as CRC, considering possible future waves of SARS-CoV-2 or other pandemics.","Ricciardiello, Luigi; Ferrari, Clarissa; Cameletti, Michela; Gaiani, Federica; Buttitta, Francesco; Bazzoli, Franco; Luigi de’Angelis, Gian; Malesci, Alberto; Laghi, Luigi",Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol,76,5

In the population, but also among health care workers (HCWs), there were concerns and skepticism about vaccinations even before the corona pandemic. METHODS: An online survey on the attitude of HCWs to vaccination against SARS-CoV‑2 was carried out in December (December 3rd–December 12th, 2020) before and in February (February 1st–February 10th, 2021) after the start of the vaccinations. Members of the German Society for Internal Intensive Care Medicine and Emergency Medicine (DGIIN) and the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive Care Medicine and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) were invited by email and on Facebook. RESULTS: In December 2305 and in February 3501 people took part. The approval rate for vaccination increased from 85.2% to 92.1% (p < 0.001). There was also an increase in willingness to vaccinate (63.8% vs. 75.9%; p < 0.001). The female gender, membership of the professional group nursing staff and age < 45 years were significantly associated with a restricted willingness to vaccinate. There was also a decrease in concerns about efficacy, side effects and long-term damage. There was clear skepticism about the vaccine from AstraZeneca (Cambridge, United Kingdom). SUMMARY: Before and after the introduction of vaccinations against SARS-CoV‑2, an increase in the willingness to vaccinate against SARS-CoV-2 can be shown in German HCWs. Technical experts must bring objectivity into the currently controversial debate through precise and transparent information and thus counteract vaccination skepticism, not only among HCWs.","Janssens, Uwe; Kluge, Stefan; Marx, Gernot; Hermes, Carsten; Salzberger, Bernd; Karagiannidis, Christian",Med Klin Intensivmed Notfmed,76,7

Digital self-care interventions have the potential to reduce health disparities, by providing personalised low-cost reusable resources that can increase access to health interventions. However, if under-served groups are unable to access or use digital technologies, Digital Health Technologies (DHTs) might make no difference, or worse, exacerbate health inequity. STUDY AIMS: To gain insights into how and why people with T2D access and use DHTs and how experiences vary between individuals and social groups. METHODS: A purposive sample of people with experience of using a DHT to help them self-care for T2D were recruited through diabetes and community groups. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in person and over the phone. Data were analysed thematically. RESULTS: A diverse sample of 21 participants were interviewed. Health care practitioners were not viewed as a good source of information about DHTs that could support T2D. Instead participants relied on their digital skills and social networks to learn about what DHTs are available and helpful. The main barriers to accessing and using DHT described by the participants were availability of DHTs from the NHS, cost and technical proficiency. However, some participants described how they were able to draw on social resources such as their social networks and social status to overcome these barriers. Participants were motivated to use DHTs because they provided self-care support, a feeling of control over T2D, and personalised advice or feedback. The selection of technology was also guided by participants’ preferences and what they valued in relation to DHTs and self-care support, and these in turn were influenced by age and gender. CONCLUSION: This research indicates that low levels of digital skills and high cost of digital health interventions can create barriers to the access and use of DHTs to support the self-care of T2D. However, social networks and social status can be leveraged to overcome some of these challenges. If digital interventions are to decrease rather than exacerbate health inequalities, these barriers and facilitators to access and use must be considered when DHTs are developed and implemented.

Machine-learning(ML) algorithms represent a novel approach for data-driven prediction of clinical outcomes with advantages over statistical modelling. We developed the Piacenza score, a ML-based score, to predict 30-day mortality in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods 852 patients (mean age 70years, 70%males) were enrolled from February to November 2020. The dataset was randomly splitted into derivation and test. The Piacenza score was obtained through the Naive Bayes classifier and externally validated on 86 patients. Using a forward-search algorithm the following six features were identified: age; mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration; PaO2/FiO2 ratio; temperature; previous stroke; gender. In case one or more of the features are not available for a patient, the model can be re-trained using only the provided features. We also compared the Piacenza score with the 4C score and with a Naive Bayes algorithm with 14 variables chosen a-priori. Results The Piacenza score showed an AUC of 0.78(95% CI 0.74-0.84, Brier-score 0.19) in the internal validation cohort and 0.79(95% CI 0.68-0.89, Brier-score 0.16) in the external validation cohort showing a comparable accuracy respect to the 4C score and to the Naive Bayes model with a-priori chosen features, which achieved an AUC of 0.78(95% CI 0.73-0.83, Brier-score 0.26) and 0.80(95% CI 0.75-0.86, Brier-score 0.17) respectively.

OBJECTIVE: To quantify changes to California’s prison population since the pandemic began and identify risk factors for Covid-19 infection. DESIGN: We described residents’ demographic characteristics, health status, Covid-19 risk scores, room occupancy, and labor participation. We used Cox proportional hazard models to estimate the association between rates of Covid-19 infection and room occupancy and out-of-room labor, respectively. SETTING: California state prisons (March 1-October 10, 2020). PARTICIPANTS: Residents of California state prisons. MEASUREMENTS: Changes in the incarcerated population’s size, composition, housing, and activities. For the risk factor analysis, the exposure variables were room type (cells vs dormitories) and labor participation (any room occupant participating in the prior 2 weeks) and the outcome variable was incident Covid-19 case rates. RESULTS: The incarcerated population decreased 19.1% (119,401 to 96,623) during the study period. On October 10, 2020, 11.5% of residents were aged ≤60, 18.3% had high Covid-19 risk scores, 31.0% participated in out-of-room labor, and 14.8% lived in rooms with ≤10 occupants. Nearly 40% of residents with high Covid-19 risk scores lived in dormitories. In 9 prisons with major outbreaks (6,928 rooms; 21,750 residents), dormitory residents had higher infection rates than cell residents (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 2.51 95%CI, 2.25-2.80) and residents of rooms with labor participation had higher rates than residents of other rooms (AHR, 1.56; 95%CI, 1.39-1.74). LIMITATIONS: Inability to measure density of residents’ living conditions or contact networks among residents and staff. CONCLUSION: Despite reductions in room occupancy and mixing, California prisons still house many medically vulnerable residents in risky settings. Reducing risks further requires a combination of strategies, including rehousing, decarceration, and vaccination.

Twenty-eight dogs were classified in four groups: (i) control group received 1 mL of sterile 0.9% saline solution; (ii) LBSap group received 600 μg of Leishmania braziliensis promastigotes protein and 1 mg of saponin adjuvant; (iii) Leishmune(®); and (iv) Leish-Tec(®). The safety and toxicity of the vaccines were measured before and after three immunizations by clinical, biochemical, and hematological parameters. The clinical examinations revealed that some dogs of LBSap and Leishmune(®) groups presented changes at the site of vaccination inoculum, such as nodules, mild edema, and local pain, which were transient and disappeared seventy-two hours after vaccination, but these results indicate that adverse changes caused by the immunizations are tolerable. The immunogenicity results demonstrate an increase of B lymphocytes CD21(+) regarding the Leishmune(®) group and monocytes CD14(+) concerning LBSap and Leishmune(®) groups. In the in vitro analyses, an increase in lymphoproliferative activity in LBSap and Leishmune(®) groups was observed, with an increase of antigen-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes in the LBSap group. A second approach of in vitro assays aimed at evaluating the percentage of antigen-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes producers of IFN-γ and IL-4, where an increase in both IFN-γ producing subpopulations in the LBSap group was observed, also showed an increase in IFN-γ producers in CD8(+) lymphocytes in the Leish-Tec(®) group. Our data regarding immunogenicity indicate that the vaccination process, especially with the LBSap vaccine, generated a protective immune response compatible with L. infantum parasite control. Based on the foregoing, the LBSap vaccine would be suitable for further studies of phase III clinical trial in endemic areas with high prevalence and incidence of canine visceral leishmaniasis (VL) cases.","Aguiar-Soares, Rodrigo Dian de Oliveira; Roatt, Bruno Mendes; Mathias, Fernando Augusto Siqueira; Reis, Levi Eduardo Soares; Cardoso, Jamille Mirelle de Oliveira; de Brito, Rory Cristiane Fortes; Ker, Henrique Gama; Corrêa-Oliveira, Rodrigo; Giunchetti, Rodolfo Cordeiro; Reis, Alexandre Barbosa",Vaccines (Basel),76,17

Various processes, such as ventilation and filtration, have been shown to reduce the probability of disease spread by removing or deactivating exhaled aerosols that potentially contain infectious material. However, such qualitative recommendations fail to specify how much of these or other disinfection techniques are needed to achieve acceptable risk levels in a particular space. An additional complication is that application of these techniques inevitably increases energy costs, the magnitude of which can vary significantly based on local weather. Moreover, the operational flexibility available to the HVAC system may be inherently limited by equipment capacities and occupant comfort requirements. Given this knowledge gap, we propose a set of dynamical models that can be used to estimate airborne transmission risk and energy consumption for building HVAC systems based on controller setpoints and a forecast of weather conditions. By combining physics-based material balances with phenomenological models of the HVAC control system, it is possible to predict time-varying airflows and other HVAC variables, which are then used to calculate key metrics. Through a variety of examples involving real and simulated commercial buildings, we show that our models can be used for monitoring purposes by applying them directly to transient building data as operated, or they may be embedded within a multi-objective optimization framework to evaluate the tradeoff between infection risk and energy consumption. By combining these applications, building managers can determine which spaces are in need of infection risk reduction and how to provide that reduction at the lowest energy cost. The key finding is that both the baseline infection risk and the most energy-efficient disinfection strategy can vary significantly from space to space and depend sensitively on the weather, thus underscoring the importance of the quantitative predictions provided by the models.","Risbeck, Michael J.; Bazant, Martin Z.; Jiang, Zhanhong; Lee, Young M.; Drees, Kirk H.; Douglas, Jonathan D.",Energy Build,76,1

This rapid transition to remote learning has generally been predicted to negatively affect students, particularly those marginalized due to their race, socioeconomic class, or gender identity. In this study, we examined the impact of this transition in the Spring 2020 semester on the grades of students enrolled in the in-person biology program at a large university in Southwestern United States as compared to the grades earned by students in the fully online biology program at the same institution. We also surveyed in-person instructors to understand changes in assessment practices as a result of the transition to remote learning during the pandemic. Finally, we surveyed students in the in-person program to learn about their perceptions of the impacts of this transition. We found that both online and in-person students received a similar small increase in grades in Spring 2020 compared to Spring 2018 and 2019. We also found no evidence of disproportionately negative impacts on grades received by students marginalized due to their race, socioeconomic class, or gender in either modality. Focusing on in-person courses, we documented that instructors made changes to their courses when they transitioned to remote learning, which may have offset some of the potential negative impacts on course grades. However, despite receiving higher grades, in-person students reported negative impacts on their learning, interactions with peers and instructors, feeling part of the campus community, and career preparation. Women reported a more negative impact on their learning and career preparation compared to men. This work provides insights into students’ perceptions of how they were disadvantaged as a result of the transition to remote instruction and illuminates potential actions that instructors can take to create more inclusive education moving forward.","Supriya, K.; Mead, Chris; Anbar, Ariel D.; Caulkins, Joshua L.; Collins, James P.; Cooper, Katelyn M.; LePore, Paul C.; Lewis, Tiffany; Pate, Amy; Scott, Rachel A.; Brownell, Sara E.",bioRxiv,76,20

A major drawback of AS is the uncertainty whether a patient truly has low risk PC based on biopsy alone. Multiparametric MRI scan together with biopsy, appears useful in separating patients who need curative therapy from those for whom AS may be safe. Two small clinical trials have shown short-term high-dose vitamin D supplementation may prevent PC progression. There is no substantial evidence for its long-term safety and efficacy, hence its use in the care of men with PC on AS needs assessment. This protocol describes the ProsD clinical trial which aims to determine if oral high-dose vitamin D supplementation taken monthly for 2 years can prevent PC progression in cases with low-to-intermediate risk of progression. METHOD AND ANALYSIS: This is an Australian national multicentre, 2:1 double-blinded placebo-controlled phase II randomised controlled trial of monthly oral high-dose vitamin D supplementation (50 000 IU cholecalciferol), in men diagnosed with localised PC who have low-to-intermediate risk of disease progression and are being managed by AS. This trial will assess the feasibility, efficacy and safety of supplementing men with an initial oral loading dose of 500 000 IU cholecalciferol, followed by a monthly oral dose of 50 000 IU during the 24 months of AS. The primary trial outcome is the commencement of active therapy for clinical or non-clinical reason, within 2 years of AS.

We conducted a nationwide cohort study of the effect of exposure to immunosuppressants on the prognosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Denmark. METHODS: We identified all SARS-CoV-2 test-positive patients from February to October 2020 and linked health care data from nationwide registers, including prescriptions for the exposure, immunosuppressant drugs. We estimated relative risks of hospital admission, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and death (each studied independently up to 30 days from testing) with a log linear binomial regression adjusted for confounders using a propensity score-based matching weights model. RESULTS: A composite immunosuppressant exposure was associated with a significantly increased risk of death (adjusted relative risk 1·56 [95% confidence interval 1.10–2.22]). The increased risk of death was mainly driven by exposure to systemic glucocorticoids (aRR 2.38 [95% CI 1.72–3.30]), which were also associated with an increased risk of hospital admission (aRR 1.34 [95% CI 1.10–1.62]), but not ICU admission (aRR 1.76 [95% CI [0.93–3.35]); these risks were greater for high cumulative doses of glucocorticoids than for moderate doses. Exposure to selective immunosuppressants, tumour necrosis factor inhibitors, or interleukin inhibitors, was not associated with an increased risk of hospitalisation, ICU admission, or death, nor was exposure to calcineurin inhibitors, other immunosuppressants, hydroxychloroquine, or chloroquine. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to glucocorticoids was associated with increased risks of hospital admission and death. Further investigation is needed to determine the optimal management of COVID-19 in patients with pre-morbid glucocorticoid usage, specifically whether these patients require altered doses of glucocorticoids.","Ward, Daniel; Gørtz, Sanne; Ernst, Martin Thomsen; Andersen, Nynne Nyboe; Kjær, Susanne K.; Hallas, Jesper; Christensen, Steffen; Christiansen, Christian Fynbo; Israelsen, Simone Bastrup; Benfield, Thomas; Pottegård, Anton; Jess, Tine",Eur Respir J,76,2

We report a study to evaluate incidence and outcomes, both short and long-term, of RVI in children receiving HSCT. Between January 2000 and December 2012, 844 patients underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) at the Hospital for Sick Children: 491 were allogeneic and 353 were autologous. When screening for causes of death in the first year after HSCT in the 844 patients, we found that RVI as a cause of death was only evident in the first 100 days after HSCT. Fifty-four (6.5%) patients were found to have an RVI within the first 100 days after HSCT (allogeneic = 32, autologous = 22). Upper and lower respiratory tract infections were documented in 31 (57%) and 23 (43%) patients, respectively. Viruses were parainfluenza (35%), respiratory syncytial virus (28%), influenza (22%), adenovirus (7%), human metapneumovirus (4%), coronavirus (2%), and rhinovirus (2%). Three patients relapsed with their primary disease before day 100 and were excluded. The overall mortality for the remaining 51 patients was 10% (allogeneic = 4, autologous = 1). All 5 deaths were directly attributable to RVI and all 5 deaths occurred in patients with a lower respiratory tract infection.

Several studies on families with children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) revealed that lockdown increased the difficulties faced by individuals with ASD, as well as parental distress. No studies have analyzed the interplay between parental distress, children’s emotional responses, and adaptive behaviors in children with ASD considering the period of the mandatory lockdown. Furthermore, we compared families with children on the spectrum and families with typically developing (TD) children in terms of their distress, children’s emotional responses, and behavioral adaptation. Methods: In this study, 120 parents of children aged 5–10 years (53 with ASD) participated. Results: In the four tested models, children’s positive and negative emotional responses mediated the impact of parental distress on children’s playing activities. In the ASD group, parents reported that their children expressed more positive emotions, but fewer playing activities, than TD children. Families with children on the spectrum reported greater behavioral problems during the lockdown and more parental distress. Conclusions: Our findings inform the interventions designed for parents to reduce distress and to develop coping strategies to better manage the caregiver–child relationship.","Levante, Annalisa; Petrocchi, Serena; Bianco, Federica; Castelli, Ilaria; Colombi, Costanza; Keller, Roberto; Narzisi, Antonio; Masi, Gabriele; Lecciso, Flavia",Brain Sci,76,10
