2070,"Pre-Travel Medical Preparation of Business and Occupational Travelers: An Analysis of the Global TravEpiNet Consortium, 2009 to 2012",2015-12-30,"The aim of the study was to understand more about pre-travel preparations and itineraries of business and occupational travelers. METHODS: De-identified data from 18 Global TravEpiNet clinics from January 2009 to December 2012 were analyzed. RESULTS: Of 23,534 travelers, 61% were non-occupational and 39% occupational. Business travelers were more likely to be men, had short times to departure and shorter trip durations, and commonly refused influenza, meningococcal, and hepatitis B vaccines. Most business travelers indicated that employers suggested the pre-travel health consultation, whereas non-occupational travelers sought consultations because of travel health concerns. CONCLUSIONS: Sub-groups of occupational travelers have characteristic profiles, with business travelers being particularly distinct. Employers play a role in encouraging business travelers to seek pre-travel consultations. Such consultations, even if scheduled immediately before travel, can identify vaccination gaps and increase coverage.","Khan, Nomana M.; Jentes, Emily S.; Brown, Clive; Han, Pauline; Rao, Sowmya R.; Kozarsky, Phyllis; Hagmann, Stefan H.F.; LaRocque, Regina C.; Ryan, Edward T.",J Occup Environ Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4697958/,336

5793,Noninvasive ventilation routine therapy for community-acquired pneumonia? Not so fast!,2001-04-27,"The widespread use of combination antiretroviral therapies (cART) has converted the prognosis of HIV infection from a rapidly progressive and ultimately fatal disease to a chronic condition with limited impact on life expectancy. Yet, HIV-infected patients remain at high risk for critical illness due to the occurrence of severe opportunistic infections in those with advanced immunosuppression (i.e., inaugural admissions or limited access to cART), a pronounced susceptibility to bacterial sepsis and tuberculosis at every stage of HIV infection, and a rising prevalence of underlying comorbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, atherosclerosis or non-AIDS-defining neoplasms in cART-treated patients aging with controlled viral replication. Several patterns of intensive care have markedly evolved in this patient population over the late cART era, including a steady decline in AIDS-related admissions, an opposite trend in admissions for exacerbated comorbidities, the emergence of additional drivers of immunosuppression (e.g., anti-neoplastic chemotherapy or solid organ transplantation), the management of cART in the acute phase of critical illness, and a dramatic progress in short-term survival that mainly results from general advances in intensive care practices. Besides, there is a lack of data regarding other features of ICU and post-ICU care in these patients, especially on the impact of sociological factors on clinical presentation and prognosis, the optimal timing of cART introduction in AIDS-related admissions, determinants of end-of-life decisions, long-term survival, and functional outcomes. In this narrative review, we sought to depict the current evidence regarding the management of HIV-infected patients admitted to the intensive care unit.","Barbier, François; Mer, Mervin; Szychowiak, Piotr; Miller, Robert F.; Mariotte, Éric; Galicier, Lionel; Bouadma, Lila; Tattevin, Pierre; Azoulay, Élie",Intensive Care Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095039/,336
7507,"Oncology nurses’ compassion fatigue, burn out and compassion satisfaction",2020-03-31,"BACKGROUND: Concerns exist regarding the prevalence and impact of unnecessary oxygen use in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We examined this issue in patients with ARDS enrolled in the Large observational study to UNderstand the Global impact of Severe Acute respiratory FailurE (LUNG SAFE) study. METHODS: In this secondary analysis of the LUNG SAFE study, we wished to determine the prevalence and the outcomes associated with hyperoxemia on day 1, sustained hyperoxemia, and excessive oxygen use in patients with early ARDS. Patients who fulfilled criteria of ARDS on day 1 and day 2 of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure were categorized based on the presence of hyperoxemia (PaO(2) > 100 mmHg) on day 1, sustained (i.e., present on day 1 and day 2) hyperoxemia, or excessive oxygen use (FIO(2) ≥ 0.60 during hyperoxemia). RESULTS: Of 2005 patients that met the inclusion criteria, 131 (6.5%) were hypoxemic (PaO(2) < 55 mmHg), 607 (30%) had hyperoxemia on day 1, and 250 (12%) had sustained hyperoxemia. Excess FIO(2) use occurred in 400 (66%) out of 607 patients with hyperoxemia. Excess FIO(2) use decreased from day 1 to day 2 of ARDS, with most hyperoxemic patients on day 2 receiving relatively low FIO(2). Multivariate analyses found no independent relationship between day 1 hyperoxemia, sustained hyperoxemia, or excess FIO(2) use and adverse clinical outcomes. Mortality was 42% in patients with excess FIO(2) use, compared to 39% in a propensity-matched sample of normoxemic (PaO(2) 55–100 mmHg) patients (P = 0.47). CONCLUSIONS: Hyperoxemia and excess oxygen use are both prevalent in early ARDS but are most often non-sustained. No relationship was found between hyperoxemia or excessive oxygen use and patient outcome in this cohort.

12574,Education and Training to Build Capacity in Total Worker Health(®): Proposed Competencies for an Emerging Field,2020-05-12,"We consider Markov decision processes (MDPs) in which the transition probabilities and rewards belong to an uncertainty set parametrized by a collection of random variables. The probability distributions for these random parameters are unknown. The problem is to compute the probability to satisfy a temporal logic specification within any MDP that corresponds to a sample from these unknown distributions. In general, this problem is undecidable, and we resort to techniques from so-called scenario optimization. Based on a finite number of samples of the uncertain parameters, each of which induces an MDP, the proposed method estimates the probability of satisfying the specification by solving a finite-dimensional convex optimization problem. The number of samples required to obtain a high confidence on this estimate is independent from the number of states and the number of random parameters. Experiments on a large set of benchmarks show that a few thousand samples suffice to obtain high-quality confidence bounds with a high probability.","Cubuktepe, Murat; Jansen, Nils; Junges, Sebastian; Katoen, Joost-Pieter; Topcu, Ufuk",Tools and Algorithms for the Construction and Analysis of Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7402411/,336

14059,Use of Heart Rate Variability Biofeedback to Reduce the Psychological Burden of Frontline Healthcare Professionals Against COVID-19,2020-10-30,"BACKGROUND: Exposure to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection has been hypothesized to be an important risk factor for multiple rheumatic diseases, but the serological evidence so far for its role in Sjögren’s syndrome (SjS) is not clearly established yet. This study aimed to assess the seroepidemiological associations of antibodies to EBV with SjS. METHODS: A seroepidemiological study containing 119 patients with SjS and 65 healthy controls was first performed, in which the associations of SjS with four commonly studied EBV antibodies including IgM-anti-viral capsid antigen (anti-VCA) antibody, IgG-anti-VCA antibody, IgG-anti-early antigen (anti-EA) antibody, and IgG-anti-EBV nuclear antigen 1 (anti-EBNA1) antibody were evaluated. A systematic review and meta-analysis of eligible seroepidemiological studies was also carried out, and data syntheses were performed using random-effect meta-analysis. RESULTS: In the case-control study, the patients with SjS had both a significantly higher prevalence of IgG-anti-EA antibody positivity (31.9% vs. 3.1%, P < 0.001) and high titers of IgG-anti-EA antibody (P < 0.001) than healthy controls. The titer of IgG-anti-VCA antibody was significantly increased in the patients with SjS compared with healthy controls (P < 0.001). IgG-anti-EA antibody seropositive patients with SjS had lower levels of both C3 (P = 0.002) and C4 (P = 0.02), and the titer of IgG-anti-EA antibody was inversely related to the levels of both C3 (r = -0.31, P < 0.001) and C4 (r = -0.20, P = 0.03). A total of 14 eligible studies on the serological associations between EBV infection and SjS were finally included into the meta-analysis, which suggested obvious associations of SjS with IgM-anti-VCA antibody [Odds ratio (OR) = 5.77, 95%CI 1.73–19.25, P = 0.004] and IgG-anti-EA antibody (OR = 9.97, 95%CI 4.58-21.67, P < 0.00001). CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this study provide strong serological evidence for the association between EBV infection and SjS. SjS has obvious associations with IgM-anti-VCA antibody and IgG-anti-EA antibody. IgG-anti-EA antibody is linked to low levels of C3 and C4 in the patients with SjS, the significance of which needs to be addressed in further studies.","Xuan, Jingxiu; Ji, Zhiqian; Wang, Bin; Zeng, Xiaoli; Chen, Rongjuan; He, Yan; Rao, Peishi; Wu, Puqi; Shi, Guixiu",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7662096/,336
14375,Universal Patient Identifier and Interoperability for Detection of Serious Drug Interactions: Retrospective Study,2020-11-20,"Topological edge modes are excitations that are localized at the materials’ edges and yet are characterized by a topological invariant defined in the bulk. Such bulk–edge correspondence has enabled the creation of robust electronic, electromagnetic, and mechanical transport properties across a wide range of systems, from cold atoms to metamaterials, active matter, and geophysical flows. Recently, the advent of non-Hermitian topological systems—wherein energy is not conserved—has sparked considerable theoretical advances. In particular, novel topological phases that can only exist in non-Hermitian systems have been introduced. However, whether such phases can be experimentally observed, and what their properties are, have remained open questions. Here, we identify and observe a form of bulk–edge correspondence for a particular non-Hermitian topological phase. We find that a change in the bulk non-Hermitian topological invariant leads to a change of topological edge-mode localization together with peculiar purely non-Hermitian properties. Using a quantum-to-classical analogy, we create a mechanical metamaterial with nonreciprocal interactions, in which we observe experimentally the predicted bulk–edge correspondence, demonstrating its robustness. Our results open avenues for the field of non-Hermitian topology and for manipulating waves in unprecedented fashions.","Ghatak, Ananya; Brandenbourger, Martin; van Wezel, Jasper; Coulais, Corentin",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7703544/,336

It has however emerged as a significant public health threat in recent years as outbreaks have been occurring regularly, especially in the Asia–Pacific. The disease can result from infections by a wide variety of human enteroviruses, particularly, Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) has garnered more attention due to its association with severe disease in infected patients. Despite the potential to result severe neurological complications or even fatality, there is currently no effective antiviral for treatment of EV-A71 infections and the only vaccines available are restricted to distribution in China. In this study, we report the in vitro and in vivo evaluation of two candidate antiviral compounds active against EV-A71, a viral capsid inhibitor (G197) and a novel host-targeting phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase III beta inhibitor (N373) which, especially when used in combination, can significantly improve the survival and pathology of infected mice.","Tan, Yong Wah; Yam, Wan Keat; Kooi, Rachel Jia Wen; Westman, Jacob; Arbrandt, Gustav; Chu, Justin Jang Hann",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8102518/,336

To this end, a series of 3,5-disubstituted-1,2,4-oxadiazole derivatives (3a–3i) were tested against H37Rv, MDR and XDR strains of MTB. Of which, compound 3a with para-trifluorophenyl substituted oxadiazole showed excellent activity against the susceptible H37Rv and MDR-MTB strain with a MIC values of 8 and 16 µg/ml, respectively. To understand the mechanism of action of these compounds (3a–3i) and identify their putative drug target, molecular docking and dynamics studies were employed against a panel of 20 mycobacterial enzymes reported to be essential for mycobacterial growth and survival. These computational studies revealed polyketide synthase (Pks13) enzyme as the putative target. Moreover, in silico ADMET predictions showed satisfactory properties for these compounds, collectively, making them, particularly compound 3a, promising leads worthy of further optimisation.","Deb, Pran Kishore; Al-Shar’i, Nizar A.; Venugopala, Katharigatta N.; Pillay, Melendhran; Borah, Pobitra",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8172222/,336

Double-strand breaks are a type of DNA damage that can be repaired by two major cellular pathways: non-homologous end joining, during which insertions or deletions may be added at the break site, and homologous recombination, in which the DNA sequence often remains unchanged. Previous work suggests that space conditions may impact the choice of DNA repair pathway, potentially compounding the risks of increased radiation exposure during space travel. However, our understanding of this problem has been limited by technical and safety concerns, which have prevented integral study of the DNA repair process in space. The CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system offers a model for the safe and targeted generation of double-strand breaks in eukaryotes. Here we describe a CRISPR-based assay for DNA break induction and assessment of double-strand break repair pathway choice entirely in space. As necessary steps in this process, we describe the first successful genetic transformation and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in space.

19638,"“Not just a hobby, but a lifestyle”: Characteristics, preferences and self-perception of individuals with different levels of involvement in birdwatching",2021-07-30,"BACKGROUND: Globally, obesity is a growing crisis. Despite obesity being preventable, over a quarter of the UK adult population is currently considered clinically obese (typically body mass index ≥35 kg/m(2)). Access to treatment for people with severe obesity is limited by long wait times and local availability. Online and group-based interventions provide means of increasing the accessibility of obesity prevention and treatment services. However, there has been no prior review of the effectiveness of group-based interventions delivered online for people with severe obesity. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this systematic review protocol is to provide an evaluation of the effectiveness and usability of different types of online, group-based interventions for people with severe obesity. METHODS: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols (PRISMA-P) and the Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome, and Study (PICOS) frameworks were used to structure this review. The review will systematically search 7 databases: MEDLINE, Embase, the Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, APA PsycNet, Web of Science, CENTRAL, and the ProQuest Dissertations and Theses databases. Two authors (MM-I and LB) will independently screen the titles and abstracts of identified articles, select studies for inclusion based on the eligibility criteria, and extract data into a standardized form. Any disagreements will be discussed and resolved by a third reviewer (EM) if necessary. Risk of bias will be assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias 2 tool and a descriptive analysis will be used to evaluate effectiveness and usability. RESULTS: The systematic review has not yet been started. It is expected to be completed and submitted for publication by December 2021. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review will summarize the effectiveness and usability of online, group-based interventions for people with obesity. It will identify the types of online delivery that have the strongest support to help inform the development of more useful and engaging interventions for people with severe obesity.

19684,A Pilot Study of Integration of Medical and Dental Care in 6 States,2021-07-22,"Bicycling has multiple health benefits. Child-rearing may influence bicycling, but little is known about the impact of this between men’s and women’s bicycling, or of number and ages of children on bicycling. This study examined the longitudinal associations between having dependent children and bicycling for transportation and recreation over 4 years among mid-aged men and women. Data were from the HABITAT study (Australia). We analysed data from three survey waves (2007, 2009, 2011) using multilevel logistic regression stratified by gender (n = 7758). Findings indicate that having dependent children was associated with bicycling for transportation and recreation in contrasting ways for men and women. The odds of bicycling were higher in men with ≥2 children aged under 18y than men without children (transportation: OR = 1.93, 95% CI: 1.26, 2.98; recreation: OR = 2.37, 95% CI: 1.67, 3.37). Over time, the odds of recreational bicycling were lower in women with ≥2 children than women without children (OR = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.73, 0.93). However, for both men and women, the odds of recreational bicycling were higher in those with children aged 6–12y than those with younger or older children (men: OR = 1.86, 95% CI: 1.39, 2.49; women: OR = 1.79, 95% CI: 1.31, 2.46). Interventions to promote bicycling must therefore consider gendered differences in bicycling for travel and active leisure, and family circumstances. An opportunity to promote bicycling might be to target parents with children aged 6–12y.","Sersli, Stephanie; Turrell, Gavin; Burton, Nicola W.; Brown, Wendy J.; Heesch, Kristiann C.",Prev Med Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8319440/,336

Samples collected from suspected cases must be sent to the reference laboratory for diagnosis using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In this study, we aimed to develop a simple DNA isolation step and real-time recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) assay for rapid detection of ASFV. RPA assay based on the p72 encoding B646L gene of ASFV was established. The assays limit of detection and cross-reactivity were investigated. Diagnostic performance was examined using 73 blood and serum samples. Two extraction approaches were tested: silica-column-based extraction method and simple non-purification DNA isolation (lysis buffer and heating, 70 °C for 20 min). All results were compared with well-established real-time PCR. In a field deployment during a disease outbreak event in Uganda, 20 whole blood samples were tested. The assay’s analytical sensitivity was 3.5 DNA copies of molecular standard per µL as determined by probit analysis on eight independent assay runs. The ASFV RPA assay only detected ASFV genotypes. Compared to real-time PCR, RPA diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were 100%. Using the heating/lysis buffer extraction procedure, ASFV-RPA revealed better tolerance to inhibitors than real-time PCR (97% and 38% positivity rate, respectively). In Uganda, infected animals were identified before the appearance of fever. The ASFV-RPA assay is shown to be as sensitive and specific as real-time PCR. Moreover, the combination of the simple extraction protocol allows its use at the point of need to improve control measures.","Ceruti, Arianna; Kobialka, Rea Maja; Ssekitoleko, Judah; Okuni, Julius Boniface; Blome, Sandra; Abd El Wahed, Ahmed; Truyen, Uwe",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8472937/,336

Some patients are asymptomatic from their infection, whereas in other patients, clinical or subclinical illness affects the patient during the perioperative period. Transmission of the agents can occur through airborne inhalation, through contact with contaminated body fluids, via food, through physical contact, or through vector organisms. Additionally, patient-patient and patient-healthcare worker (HCW) transmission of infectious diseases remain a high concern. The perioperative period represents a unique challenge in the prevention of transmission. While diligent hand washing remains a staple in the standard of care, other measures must be implemented with certain infectious agents. Several of the major infectious diseases will be reviewed in this section, and universal precautions will be examined. Careful perioperative planning and situational awareness should be practiced by the healthcare worker taking care of patients with transmissible diseases.","Cohen, Seth R.; Ligda, Kristin Ondecko",Basic Clinical Anesthesia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122150/,336

However, the majority of real networks are continuously evolving, and deriving the whole embedding for every snapshot is computationally intensive. To avoid recomputing the embedding over time, we explore streaming network embedding for two reasons: 1) to efficiently identify the nodes required to update the embeddings under multi-type network changes, and 2) to carefully revise the embeddings to maintain transduction over different parts of the network. Specifically, we propose a new representation learning framework, named Graph Memory Refreshing (GMR), to preserve both global types of structural information efficiently. We prove that GMR maintains the consistency of embeddings (crucial for network analysis) for isomorphic structures better than existing approaches. Experimental results demonstrate that GMR outperforms the baselines with much smaller time.","Chen, Hsi-Wen; Shuai, Hong-Han; Wang, Sheng-De; Yang, De-Nian",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206285/,336

However, sufficient clinical evidence to support the efficacy of this target C(min) has not been obtained. Even though the recommended high C(min) of teicoplanin was associated with better clinical outcome, reaching the target concentration is challenging. METHODS: Pharmacokinetics and adverse events were evaluated in all eligible patients. For clinical efficacy, patients who had bacteremia/complicated MRSA infections were analyzed. The primary endpoint for clinical efficacy was an early clinical response at 72–96 h after the start of therapy. Five dosed of 12 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg was administered as an enhanced or conventional high loading dose regimen, respectively. The C(min) was obtained at 72 h after the first dose. RESULTS: Overall, 512 patients were eligible, and 76 patients were analyzed for treatment efficacy. The proportion of patients achieving the target C(min) range (20–40 μg/mL) by the enhanced regimen was significantly higher than for the conventional regimen (75.2% versus 41.0%, p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, C(min) ≥ 20 μg/mL was an independent factor for an early clinical response (odds ratio 3.95, 95% confidence interval 1.25–12.53). There was no significant difference in the occurrence of adverse events between patients who did or did not achieve a C(min) ≥ 20 μg/mL. CONCLUSION: A target C(min) ≥ 20 μg/mL might improve early clinical responses during the treatment of difficult MRSA infections using 12 mg/kg teicoplanin for five doses within the initial 3 days.","Ueda, Takashi; Takesue, Yoshio; Nakajima, Kazuhiko; Ichiki, Kaoru; Ishikawa, Kaori; Takai, Yoshiko; Yamada, Kumiko; Tsuchida, Toshie; Otani, Naruhito; Takahashi, Yoshiko; Ishihara, Mika; Takubo, Shingo; Ikeuchi, Hiroki; Uchino, Motoi; Kimura, Takeshi",BMC Pharmacol Toxicol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7341468/,336
38917,Challenges Facing Women Survivors of Self-Immolation in the Kurdish Regions of Iran: A Qualitative Study,2020-08-14,"Urban environment imposes challenges due to its dynamics and thermodynamic characteristics of the built environment. The present study aims to study the effect of lockdown during COVID-19 on the spatio-temporal land surface temperature (LST) patterns in Dehradun city. The TIRS sensor data of 14 April 2020 (post-lockdown), 28 April 2019, 25 April 2018 and 08 May 2017 were downloaded, and LST was retrieved using radiative transfer equation. The wardwise change in LST, urban hot spots and thermal comfort was studied as a function of built-up density. It was observed that there was an overall decrease in LST values in Dehradun city in post-COVID lockdown period. Wards with high built-up density had minimum decrease in LST; on the contrary, wards with large proportion of open spaces and having low, medium built-up density had the maximum decrease in LST. Hot spot analysis was carried out using Getis Ord GI* statistic, and the level of thermal comfort was found using the urban thermal field variance index. It was observed that there was an increase in number of hot spots accompanied by a decrease in thermal comfort level post-lockdown. The methodology proposed in the present study can be applied to other Indian cities which exhibit similar growth patterns and will provide a tool for rational decision making.","Maithani, Sandeep; Nautiyal, Garima; Sharma, Archana",J Indian Soc Remote Sens,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7473830/,336

41268,Management of people with epilepsy during the COVID-19 pandemic: a national survey among epileptologists in China,2020-10-27,"Spatiotemporally ordered production of cells is essential for brain development. Normally, most undifferentiated neural progenitor cells (NPCs) face the apical (ventricular) surface of embryonic brain walls. Pathological detachment of NPCs from the apical surface and their invasion of outer neuronal territories, i.e., formation of NPC heterotopias, can disrupt the overall structure of the brain. Although NPC heterotopias have previously been observed in a variety of experimental contexts, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Yes-associated protein 1 (Yap1) and the TEA domain (Tead) proteins, which act downstream of Hippo signaling, enhance the stem-like characteristics of NPCs. Elevated expression of Yap1 or Tead in the neural tube (future spinal cord) induces massive NPC heterotopias, but Yap/Tead-induced expansion of NPCs in the developing brain has not been previously reported to produce NPC heterotopias. To determine whether NPC heterotopias occur in a regionally characteristic manner, we introduced the Yap1-S112A or Tead-VP16 into NPCs of the telencephalon and diencephalon, two neighboring but distinct forebrain regions, of embryonic day 10 mice by in utero electroporation, and compared NPC heterotopia formation. Although NPCs in both regions exhibited enhanced stem-like behaviors, heterotopias were larger and more frequent in the diencephalon than in the telencephalon. This result, the first example of Yap/Tead-induced NPC heterotopia in the forebrain, reveals that Yap/Tead-induced NPC heterotopia is not specific to the neural tube, and also suggests that this phenomenon depends on regional factors such as the three-dimensional geometry and assembly of these cells.","Saito, Kanako; Kawasoe, Ryotaro; Sasaki, Hiroshi; Kawaguchi, Ayano; Miyata, Takaki",Neurochem Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7550386/,336

As part of this initiative, we have developed a strategy for generating in silico patients consistent with target population characteristics, which can then be used in combination with in vivo data on an augmented clinical trial. RESULTS: One of the most challenging tasks for using virtual patients is developing a methodology to reproduce biological diversity of the target population, ie, providing an appropriate strategy for generating libraries of digital patients. This has been achieved through the creation of the initial immune system repertoire in a stochastic way, and through the identification of a vector of features that combines both biological and pathophysiological parameters that personalise the digital patient to reproduce the physiology and the pathophysiology of the subject. CONCLUSIONS: We propose a sequential approach to sampling from the joint features population distribution in order to create a cohort of virtual patients with some specific characteristics, resembling the recruitment process for the target clinical trial, which then can be used for augmenting the information from the physical the trial to help reduce its size and duration.","Juárez, Miguel A.; Pennisi, Marzio; Russo, Giulia; Kiagias, Dimitrios; Curreli, Cristina; Viceconti, Marco; Pappalardo, Francesco",BMC Bioinformatics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7733699/,336
43332,Risk and Protective Factors Associated with Custodial Grandparents’ Psychological Distress in COVID-19,2020-12-16,"Brain monitors which track quantitative electroencephalogram (EEG) signatures to monitor sedation levels are drug and patient specific. There is a need for robust sedation level monitoring systems to accurately track sedation levels across all drug classes, sex and age groups. Forty-four quantitative features estimated from a pooled dataset of 204 EEG recordings from 66 healthy adult volunteers who received either propofol, dexmedetomidine, or sevoflurane (all with and without remifentanil) were used in a machine learning based automated system to estimate the depth of sedation. Model training and evaluation were performed using leave-one-out cross validation methodology. We trained four machine learning models to predict sedation levels and evaluated the influence of remifentanil, age, and sex on the prediction performance. The area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUC) was used to assess the performance of the prediction model. The ensemble tree with bagging outperformed other machine learning models and predicted sedation levels with an AUC = 0.88 (0.81–0.90). There were significant differences in the prediction probability of the automated systems when trained and tested across different age groups and sex. The performance of the EEG based sedation level prediction system is drug, sex, and age specific. Nonlinear machine-learning models using quantitative EEG features can accurately predict sedation levels. The results obtained in this study may provide a useful reference for developing next generation EEG based sedation level prediction systems using advanced machine learning algorithms.

Whether or not this variation affects pathogen subtype diversification is unknown. Here we show a strong positive correlation between ethnic diversity in African countries and both human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 p24gag and subtype diversity. We demonstrate that ethnic HLA-allele differences between populations have influenced HIV-1 subtype diversification as the virus adapted to escape common antiviral immune responses. The evolution of HIV Subtype B (HIV-B), which does not appear to be indigenous to Africa, is strongly affected by immune responses associated with Eurasian HLA variants acquired through adaptive introgression from Neanderthals and Denisovans. Furthermore, we show that the increasing and disproportionate number of HIV-infections among African Americans in the USA drive HIV-B evolution towards an Africa-centric HIV-1 state. Similar adaptation of other pathogens to HLA variants common in affected populations is likely.","Kist, Nicolaas C; Lambert, Ben; Campbell, Samuel; Katzourakis, Aris; Lunn, Daniel; Lemey, Philippe; Iversen, Astrid K N",Virus Evol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7733611/,336

Culpability for such threats, while perhaps engaging much of humanity, seems most likely attributable to pro-capitalist individuals (e.g., financiers) and groups (e.g., corporations and transnational trade organizations)—which appear to have relatively successfully influenced most living and nonliving entities to form assemblages (dispositifs) that serve their self-interested ideologies. Given harms associated with such assemblages, it seems clear to many analysts that they need to be severely disrupted or, perhaps, replaced with alliances of entities that are based on ideological perspectives that may contribute to comprehensive wellbeing. Although pro-capitalist assemblages have been extremely resilient, it seems that current sociopolitical instability and, moreover, considerable disruption from the CoViD-19 pandemic may provide unprecedented opportunities for dramatic changes. In this article, after consideration of characteristics and extents of harms linked to fields of science, mathematics and technology/engineering, possibilities are described and critically defended for uses of a particular curriculum and pedagogical framework for helping students to imagine and, perhaps, realize new assemblages of entities that are held together by ideologies that they consider appropriate.","Bencze, J.

Despite growing depoliticalization and decentralization, South Korea’s cultural diplomacy policy remains unilateral in embracing Parasite’s success for nation branding while drawing on expanding private-sector resources to produce and market the film. To explicate South Korea’s nation brand vis-à-vis Parasite, a Leximancer analysis of 8808 texts investigated concepts that are associated with the film as a complex bundle of images, meanings, associations, and experiences in the minds of international audiences. The texts associate Parasite with the national entity of South Korea and the country’s most significant cultural content export, the Korean Wave. Sentiment analyses through Leximancer also show positive attitudes, thus helping to reinforce the nation branding of Parasite and its successes as a tangible South Korean national resource, consistent with a soft power approach.","Lee, Seow Ting",Place Brand Public Dipl,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7786884/,336
51909,Disruptive innovation for inclusive renewable policy in sub-Saharan Africa: A social shaping of technology analysis of appliance uptake in Rwanda,2021-05-11,"demographic growth (United Nations 2019), the rapid development of the global middle class (Kharas 2017), growing urbanisation (United Nations 2018) and the transition towards a low-carbon global economy (Hund et al. 2020); point towards a continued, exponential growth of the global demand and production of minerals and metals (Christmann 2017; Elshkaki et al. 2018; Halada et al. 2008; Hund et al. 2020; Schipper et al. 2018). Despite the efforts made by some producers and some authorities to strengthen the already important contribution of the minerals and metals industry to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the production of minerals and metals has negative impacts both on the global and on local ecosystems. It already contributes to 16% of global CO(2) emissions (OECD 2019) and it generates about 50 bn t solid waste per year, 25 times the estimated annual amount of urban waste (Franks et al. 2021). This waste is composed of mostly barren rock fragments, essentially overburden that needed to be stripped to access the ore, and of fine-grained ore processing tailings. The latter, if containing sulphides such as pyrite and residual minerals containing elements such as arsenic, cadmium, mercury, selenium or tellurium, can become highly problematic for the well-being of future generations. The production of minerals and metals also can be a source of conflicts and of social disruption. Failure to globally and sustainably manage the production of minerals and metals, in a transparent and multilateral framework providing a stable, foreseeable and level playing field for investors and for trade, could limit the capacity of the industry to reply to future demand and lead to potentially disastrous global conflicts. Depending on the practices of individual producers, on the quality of national and/or regional regulatory frameworks and on the effectiveness of their implementation, a same mineral or metal can be produced under very differing environmental and social conditions. Despite progress on sustainability performance reporting and of transparency of some parts of the industry, end-users of minerals and metals do not know how the minerals and metals they use have been produced and they hardly can choose among various supply sources, although from a sustainability perspective there are great differences among the practices of individual producers. The development of an international governance framework to support the development of transparency and verifiable corporate accountability, to foster research and innovation to reduce the negative impacts of the industry and to provide incentives rewarding pro-sustainability action, is called for. Support to document and disseminate best practice and best available technologies as well as to strengthen the global institutional capacities to manage this very complex and vital industry is needed. This could be an important role for a future International Minerals and Metals Agency. So far, only the exploration and mining of deep-sea mineral deposits located in international zones of the oceans are internationally regulated under the UN Convention On the Law Of the Sea (UNCLOS), with a specific International Agency in charge of its implementation and of the provision of scientific and technical guidance: the International Seabed Authority (Kingston, Jamaica), created in 1994. The European Union could and should play an important role in these developments as it is an important global end-user of minerals and metals mostly produced outside its borders. The EU’s environmental footprint outside its borders is very high and growing. According to EUROSTAT trade data, EU imports of goods from beyond its borders doubled in value from 2002 to 2018, with China’s share having grown by over 460% over this period, representing 19% of the total imports of goods. China is the world largest greenhouse gas emitter. EU’s very strong point is its long history of successful research and innovation, dating back to the Renaissance (15th Century BCE). Its very large and highly qualified human resources in science and innovation much benefits from progressive European-scale structuration and integration of mineral- and metal-related research and innovation thanks to the European Union raw material–related policies developed since 2008 (European Commission 2008) under the EU Raw Materials Initiative (see p. 20 ff.). The EIT Raw Materials, launched in 2015, is the world largest organised and funded mineral- and metal-related innovation network, linking over 120 partners from academia, industry and research organisations (EIT Raw Materials, 2021). But, despite these positive developments, it so far lacks the legal basis to develop its own mineral resource policy and its own homogeneous regulatory framework. It nevertheless can act in different areas that are linked to the development of a global, minerals and metals industry based on sustainable development principles through its capacity to act as European Union in domains such as development cooperation, energy, environment, higher education, research and innovation, as well as trade. It will require long-term vision and political leadership to develop and implement a sustainable EU raw materials policy that would also act as a catalyst for the development of much needed global minerals and metals governance. The publication by the European Commission, in September 2020, of its Action Plan on Critical Raw Materials, part of the European Raw Materials Initiative launched in 2008, could be an important step to address the issues outlined in this paper.","Christmann, Patrice",Miner Econ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8059114/,336

So, it becomes crucial to identify reliable predictor biomarkers for COVID-19 disease severity and short term mortality. Many biomarkers are currently investigated for their prognostic role in COVID-19 patients. Our study is retrospective and aims to evaluate role of semi-quantitative CT-severity scoring versus LDH as prognostic biomarkers for COVID-19 disease severity and short-term clinical outcome. RESULTS: Two hundred sixty-six patients between April 2020 and November 2020 with positive RT-PCR results underwent non-enhanced CT scan chest in our hospital and were retrospectively evaluated for CT severity scoring and serum LDH level measurement. Data were correlated with clinical disease severity. CT severity score and LDH were significantly higher in severe and critical cases compared to mild cases (P value < 0.001). High predictive significance of CT severity score for COVID-19 disease course noted, with cut-off value ≥ 13 highly predictive of severe disease (96.96% accuracy); cut-off value ≥ 16 highly predictive of critical disease (94.21% accuracy); and cut-off value ≥ 19 highly predictive of short-term mortality (92.56% accuracy). CT severity score has higher sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive values as well as overall accuracy compared to LDH level in predicting severe, critical cases, and short-term mortality. CONCLUSION: Semi-quantitative CT severity scoring has high predictive significance for COVID-19 disease severity and short-term mortality with higher sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy compared to LDH. Our study strongly supports the use of CT severity scoring as a powerful prognostic biomarker for COVID-19 disease severity and short-term clinical outcome to allow triage of need for hospital admission, earlier medical interference, and to effectively prioritize medical resources for cases with high mortality risk for better decision making and clinical outcome.","Magdy, Ahmed M.; Saad, Mohammad A.; El Khateeb, Ahmed F.; Ahmed, Mona I.; Gamal El-Din, Dina H.",Egypt J Radiol Nucl Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8079847/,336

This study aims to explore the association between COVID-19 cases and meteorological parameters and to predict COVID-19 transmission for an extended period covering different climatic patterns. The number of COVID-19 cases, daily records of rainfall, temperature, relative humidity and wind speed data were collected for April and May 2020 from the eight major divisions in Bangladesh. The basic statistical analyses and auto regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) using SPSS tool were applied to evaluate and explore association between meteorological parameters and COVID-19 cases and its transmission trend. A greater number of significant positive associations (r = 0.24–0.58) is found to exist between the relative humidity and COVID-19 cases across the cities, while with temperature both positive and negative associations (r = − 0.23 to 0.72) were revealed. Furthermore, both the rainfall and wind speed exhibit positive correlations. ARIMA model portrayed predictive trend of COVID-19 transmission, from its inception on 8 March 2020 to September 2020, in Bangladesh. The month of July showed the highest daily COVID-19 cases prior to lowering at steady rate till September illustrating the influnce of meteorological parameters.

As structures of drugs increase in complexity, the importance of computational predictions comes into sharp focus. Knowledge of various computational tools enables us to predict the molecular properties, toxicity, and biological efficacy of the drugs and help the medicinal chemists to discover new drugs more efficiently. Newly approved drugs have higher affinities for proteins and nucleic acids and are applied for the treatment of human diseases. We have carried out the computational studies of 21 such NCEs, specifically small molecules and antibody–drug conjugates, and studied the biological efficacy of these drugs. Their bioactivity score and molecular and pharmacokinetic properties were evaluated using online computer software programs, viz., Molinspiration and Osiris Property Explorer. The SwissTargetPrediction tool was used for the efficient prediction of protein targets for the NCEs. The results indicated higher stability for the drug complexes due to a larger HOMO–LUMO gap. A high electrophilicity index reflects good electrophilic behavior and high reactivity of the drugs. Lipinski’s ‘‘rule of five’’ indicated that most of the drug complexes are likely to be orally active. These drugs also showed non-mutagenic, non-tumorigenic, non-irritant, and non-effective reproductive behavior. We hope that these studies will provide an insight into molecular recognition and definitely help the medicinal chemists to design new drugs in future.","Srivastava, Ruby",ACS Omega,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8482469/,336
59520,Views and experiences of community pharmacy team members on antimicrobial stewardship activities in Scotland: a qualitative study.,2020-08-16,"BACKGROUND A challenge in esophageal reconstruction after esophagectomy is that the distance from the neck to the abdomen must be replaced with a long segment obtained from the gastrointestinal tract. The success or failure of the reconstruction depends on the blood flow to the reconstructed organ and the tension on the anastomotic site, both of which depend on the reconstruction distance. There are three possible esophageal reconstruction routes: posterior mediastinal, retrosternal, and subcutaneous. However, there is still no consensus as to which route is the shortest. METHODS The length of each reconstruction route was retrospectively compared using measurements obtained during surgery, where the strategy was to pull up the gastric conduit through the shortest route. The proximal reference point was defined as the left inferior border of the cricoid cartilage and the distal reference point was defined as the superior border of the duodenum arising from the head of the pancreas. RESULTS This study involved 112 Japanese patients with esophageal cancer (102 men, 10 women). The mean distances of the posterior mediastinal, retrosternal, and subcutaneous routes were 34.7 ± 2.37 cm, 32.4 ± 2.24 cm, and 36.3 ± 2.27 cm, respectively. The retrosternal route was significantly shorter than the other two routes (both p < 0.0001) and shorter by 2.31 cm on average than the posterior mediastinal route. The retrosternal route was longer than the posterior mediastinal route in only 5 patients, with a difference of less than 1 cm. CONCLUSION The retrosternal route was the shortest for esophageal reconstruction in living Japanese patients.","Yasuda, Takushi; Shiraishi, Osamu; Kato, Hiroaki; Hiraki, Yoko; Momose, Kota; Yasuda, Atsushi; Shinkai, Masayuki; Kimura, Yutaka; Imano, Motohiro",Esophagus : official journal of the Japan Esophageal Society,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10388-020-00805-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33462727/,336

All of them were followed up, and their PTSD symptoms were assessed 3 years later. The adolescent version of the UCLA PTSD Reaction Index, the earthquake exposure scale, and the Junior Eysenck Personality Questionnaire were used to determine PTSD symptoms, trauma experiences, and personality traits, respectively. We sequenced candidate genes involved in the regulation of long-term potentiation via NMDA-type receptors to identify the related SNP variations. RESULTS Being trapped for a longer period of time, feeling one's own or a family member's life to be in danger, losing a close family member or friend, extraversion, neuroticism, TrkB, G72 and CNTF were found to be associated with the maintenance of PTSD symptoms.

Prior to COVID-19 restrictions, 23% of educators had conducted more than 50% of their total teaching online; however, 69% expected to conduct more than half of their teaching online by the end of 2020 and 12% anticipated 90% or more of their teaching would be online. Some 76% of educators expected to provide more online lectures after the pandemic and 63% anticipated new methods to deliver practical education. Around half were planning to introduce new teaching online platforms (54%) and more online assessment methods (53%). The global need for increasing numbers of skilled personnel points to a crucial role for educators in teaching the contact lens practitioners of the future. Contact lens education delivery was already evolving prior to COVID-19, and changes that are currently occurring may lead to permanent differences in the way contact lenses are taught in future. The International Association of Contact Lens Educators (IACLE) provides educators with a standardised global curriculum, online resources and teaching technology that could also serve as a model for wider ophthalmic education in future.","Naroo, Shehzad A; Morgan, Philip B; Shinde, Lakshmi; Lee, Cheni; Ewbank, Alison",Ophthalmic & physiological optics : the journal of the British College of Ophthalmic Opticians,https://doi.org/10.1111/opo.12791; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33609327/,336

64105,Caregiver Satisfaction and Effectiveness of Teleconsultation in Children and Adolescents With Migraine During the Ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020-11-10,"OBJECTIVES To obtain timely and detailed data on COVID-19 cases in the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) uses 2 data sources: (1) aggregate counts for daily situational awareness and (2) person-level data for each case (case surveillance). The objective of this study was to describe the sensitivity of case ascertainment and the completeness of person-level data received by CDC through national COVID-19 case surveillance. METHODS We compared case and death counts from case surveillance data with aggregate counts received by CDC during April 5-September 30, 2020. We analyzed case surveillance data to describe geographic and temporal trends in data completeness for selected variables, including demographic characteristics, underlying medical conditions, and outcomes. RESULTS As of November 18, 2020, national COVID-19 case surveillance data received by CDC during April 5-September 30, 2020, included 4 990 629 cases and 141 935 deaths, representing 72.7% of the volume of cases (n = 6 863 251) and 71.8% of the volume of deaths (n = 197 756) in aggregate counts. Nationally, completeness in case surveillance records was highest for age (99.9%) and sex (98.8%). Data on race/ethnicity were complete for 56.9% of cases; completeness varied by region. Data completeness for each underlying medical condition assessed was <25% and generally declined during the study period. About half of case records had complete data on hospitalization and death status. CONCLUSIONS Incompleteness in national COVID-19 case surveillance data might limit their usefulness. Streamlining and automating surveillance processes would decrease reporting burdens on jurisdictions and likely improve completeness of national COVID-19 case surveillance data.","Gold, Jeremy A W; DeCuir, Jennifer; Coyle, Jayme P; Duca, Lindsey M; Adjemian, Jennifer; Anderson, Kayla N; Baack, Brittney N; Bhattarai, Achuyt; Dee, Deborah; Durant, Tonji M; Ewetola, Raimi; Finlayson, Teresa; Roush, Sandra W; Yin, Shaoman; Jackson, Brendan R; Fullerton, Kathleen E",Public health reports,https://doi.org/10.1177/00333549211006973; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33789540/,336
64176,Is there a silver lining for US health care from COVID-19 pandemic?,2020-06-30,"PURPOSE Experts have recommended exercise for improved sleep, but often with the caveat that one should avoid nighttime exercise. The aim of this study was to challenge this recommendation in a sample who might be most prone to sleep impairment after nighttime exercise. The secondary aims were to assess whether or not post-treatment sleep was correlated with anxiolytic effects or downregulation of body temperature. METHODS Twelve sedentary adults with insomnia completed two treatments (separated by 2-5 days) in counterbalanced order: (1) 30 min of moderate treadmill exercise (60-70% maximum heart rate) + 15 min of moderate resistance exercise and (2) a control treatment (reading). Each treatment was completed 2 h before bedtime and followed by a 10-min shower, a light snack, 8 h of polysomnographic recording, and a sleep questionnaire. State anxiety was assessed before and 30 min after each treatment and 10 min before bedtime. Body temperature was assessed from pre-exercise to wake time. RESULTS No significant treatment differences in sleep were found, and Hedges g paired comparisons indicated small effect sizes; however, two participants had severely disturbed objective sleep following exercise. Significant correlations were found between change in state anxiety from pre-exercise to bedtime and TST (r = 0.69, p = 0.03). Stage 1 (r = 0.67, p = 0.03), WASO (r = 0.69, p = 0.03), and sleep efficiency (r = 0.66, p = 0.02). No significant correlations were found of sleep with temperature decline. CONCLUSIONS Profound sleep disturbance after exercise in some participants, and no marked sleep improvement in the others, provides some support for caution regarding late-night exercise for sedentary individuals with insomnia.","Youngstedt, Shawn D; Ito, Wakako; Passos, Giselle Soares; Santana, Marcos Gonçalves; Youngstedt, Julia M",Sleep & breathing = Schlaf & Atmung,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11325-020-02284-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423141/,336

In order to facilitate the diagnosis of AD, we investigated plasma amino acid profile through metabolomics approach. Total 33 human subjects were enrolled in the study: 11 coronary heart disease (CHD) patients without aortic lesion and 11 acute AD and 11 chronic AD. Amino acids were identified in plasma using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and were further subjected to multiple logistic regression analysis. The score plots of principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares-discriminate analysis (PLS-DA) showed clear discrimination of CHD patients with AD, acute AD or chronic AD patients, respectively. The contents of histidine, glycine, serine, citrate, ornithine, hydroxyproline, proline and sarcosine were significant different in acute AD patients comparing with CHD patients. The levels of citrate, GABA, glutamate and cysteine were significant different in chronic AD patients comparing with CHD patients. The contents of glutamate and phenylalanine were significant changed in acute AD patients comparing with chronic AD patients. Plasma aminograms were significantly altered in patients with AD comparing with CHD, especially in acute AD, suggesting amino acid profile is expected to exploit a novel, non-invasive, objective diagnosis for AD.","Wang, Linlin; Liu, Sha; Yang, Wengang; Yu, Haitao; Zhang, Li; Ma, Ping; Wu, Peng; Li, Xue; Cho, Kenka; Xue, Song; Jiang, Baohong",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/srep40146; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28071727/,336

Based on semi-structured interviews with 20 clients and 15 caseworkers, we assessed how furniture and household goods contributed to individuals' sense of home and overall well-being. Results of our thematic analysis revealed four themes: (1) respect; (2) creating a home; (3) physical comfort; and (4) emotional well-being. Participants described how the absence of furniture, dishes, and other goods affected their self-esteem, mental health, and physical health.

Human mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are adult multipotent cells with antimicrobial properties, mediated through direct bactericidal activity and modulation of host innate and adaptive immune cells. More than 30 in vivo studies have reported on the use of human MSCs for the treatment of infectious diseases, with many more studies of animal MSCs in same-species models of infection. MSCs demonstrate potent antimicrobial effects against the major classes of human pathogens (bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites) across a wide range of infection models. Mechanistic studies have yielded important insight into their immunomodulatory and bactericidal activity, which can be enhanced through various forms of preconditioning. MSCs are being investigated in over 80 clinical trials for difficult-to-treat infectious diseases, including sepsis and pulmonary, intra-abdominal, cutaneous, and viral infections. Completed trials consistently report MSCs to be safe and well tolerated, with signals of efficacy against some infectious diseases. Although significant obstacles must be overcome to produce a standardized, affordable, clinical-grade cell therapy, these studies suggest that MSCs may have particular potential as an adjunct therapy in complex or resistant infections.","Shaw, Timothy D; Krasnodembskaya, Anna D; Schroeder, Gunnar N; Zumla, Alimuddin; Maeurer, Markus; O'Kane, Cecilia M",Clinical microbiology reviews,https://doi.org/10.1128/cmr.00064-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34612662/,336
70597,Effect of web-based time-use intervention on occupational balance during the Covid-19 pandemic.,2021-03-21,"OBJECTIVE To determine the influence of patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure on circulatory biomarkers. METHODS Consecutive PFO-related stroke patients were prospectively enrolled and followed with serial sampling of cardiac atrial and venous blood, pre and post PFO closure over time. Candidate biomarkers were identified by mass spectrometry in a discovery cohort first, and lead candidates were validated in an independent cohort. RESULTS PFO stroke patients (n=254) were recruited and followed up to four years (median: 2.01; IQR: 0.77∼2.54). Metabolite profiling in discovery cohort (n=12) identified homocysteine as the most significantly decreased factor in intra-cardiac plasma after PFO closure (FDR=0.001). This was confirmed in validation cohort (n=181), where intra-cardiac total homocysteine (tHcy) reduced immediately in patients with complete closure, but not in those with residual shunting, suggesting association of PFO shunting with tHcy elevation (β: 0.115; 95% CI: 0.047∼0.183; p=0.001). tHcy reduction was more dramatic in left atrium than right (p<0.001), suggesting clearance through pulmonary circulation. Long-term effect of PFO closure was also monitored and compared to medical treatment alone (n=61). Complete PFO closure resulted in long-term tHcy reduction in peripheral blood, whereas medical therapy alone showed no effect (β: -0.208; 95% CI: -0.375∼-0.058; p=0.007). Residual shunting was again independently associated with persistently elevated tHcy (β: 0.184; 95% CI: 0.051∼0.316; p=0.007). CONCLUSIONS PFO shunting may contribute to circulatory tHcy elevation, which is renormalized by PFO closure. PFO is not just a door for clots, but may itself enhance clot formation and injure neurovasculature by clot-independent mechanisms. Biomarkers such as tHcy can potentially serve as cost-effective measures of residual shunting and neurovascular risk for PFO stroke.","Deng, Wenjun; McMullin, David; Inglessis-Azuaje, Ignacio; Locascio, Joseph J; Palacios, Igor F; Buonanno, Ferdinando S; Lo, Eng H; Ning, MingMing",Neurology,https://doi.org/10.1212/wnl.0000000000012188; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33986139/,336

71740,"Anxiety, depression, and knowledge level in postpartum women during the COVID-19 pandemic.",2020-12-18,"Several factors can influence individual and group behavioral variation that can have important fitness consequences. In this study, we tested how two habitat types (seminatural meadows and meadows invaded by Solidago plants) and factors like colony and worker size and nest density influence behavioral (activity, meanderness, exploration, aggression, and nest displacement) variation on different levels of the social organization of Myrmica rubra ants and how these might affect the colony productivity. We assumed that the factors within the two habitat types exert different selective pressures on individual and colony behavioral variation that affects colony productivity. Our results showed individual-/colony-specific expression of both mean and residual behavioral variation of the studied behavioral traits. Although habitat type did not have any direct effect, habitat-dependent factors, like colony size and nest density influenced the individual mean and residual variation of several traits. We also found personality at the individual-level and at the colony level. Exploration positively influenced the total- and worker production in both habitats. Worker aggression influenced all the productivity parameters in seminatural meadows, whereas activity had a positive effect on the worker and total production in invaded meadows. Our results suggest that habitat type, through its environmental characteristics, can affect different behavioral traits both at the individual and colony level and that those with the strongest effect on colony productivity primarily shape the personality of individuals. Our results highlight the need for complex environmental manipulations to fully understand the effects shaping behavior and reproduction in colony-living species.","Maák, István; Trigos-Peral, Gema; Ślipiński, Piotr; Grześ, Irena M; Horváth, Gergely; Witek, Magdalena",Behavioral ecology : official journal of the International Society for Behavioral Ecology,https://doi.org/10.1093/beheco/araa112; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33708007/,336

72927,'Let us Help'- Why Senior Medical Students are the Next Step in Battling the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020-04-16,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE Spinal dural arteriovenous fistulas (SDAVFs) require pretreatment angiography; embolization can be performed in the same session. To validate this approach, obliteration and morbidity rates of 'endovascular-first' (embolization and microsurgery in the case of embolization failures) must be compared with rates for 'microsurgery-first' (microsurgical ligation without attempted embolization) approaches. METHODS We reviewed our institutional database (January 1998-October 2015) for SDAVFs, performing an intention-to-treat analysis comparing endovascular-first and microsurgery-first approaches. RESULTS A total of 71 patients underwent surgical and/or endovascular treatment for SDAVFs. All SDAVFs were ultimately occluded. Of 35 patients under consideration for an endovascular-first approach, radicular artery anatomy or anterior spinal artery embolization risk precluded attempting embolization in seven cases (20%). Among 28 patients undergoing embolization, angiographic non-opacification of the fistula was noted in 18 (64%). Fourteen patients had obliteration with excellent casting of the draining vein (50%) and did not undergo surgery. There were no significant differences in total complications (9% vs 11%; p=1.0) or permanent complications (3% vs 4%; p=1.0) after attempted endovascular and surgical treatment. Based on an intention-to-treat analysis, there were no significant differences in total complications (11% vs 14%; p=1.0), permanent complications (6% vs 3%; p=0.61), or the symptomatic resolution/improvement rate (80% vs 78%; p=1.0) between endovascular-first and microsurgery-first groups. CONCLUSIONS Our results support attempted embolization of SDAVFs prior to consideration of microsurgery, allowing for a less invasive treatment option in the same session as diagnostic angiography.","Gross, Bradley A; Albuquerque, Felipe C; Moon, Karam; McDougall, Cameron G",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2016-012333; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27016317/,336

73519,Effects of the dietary flavonoid quercetin upon performance and health.,2009,"Phage display antibody (PDA) libraries, allows the rapid isolation and characterization of high specificity monoclonal antibodies for therapeutic and diagnostic applications. However, selection of positive binding clones from synthetic and semi-synthetic libraries has an inherent bias toward clones containing randomly generated amber stop codons, complicating the identification of high affinity binding antibodies. We screened Tomlinson I and J library against receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS CoV2, eight clones which showed positive binding in phage ELISA, contained one or more amber stop codons in their scFv gene sequences. The presence of amber stop codons within the antibody sequence causes the premature termination of soluble form of scFv expression in non-suppressor E.coli strain. In the present study, we have used a novel strategy that allows soluble expression of scFvs having amber stop codon in their gene sequences (without phage PIII protein fusion), in the suppressor strain. This strategy of introduction of Ochre (TAA) codon at the junction of scFv and PIII gene, speeds up the initial screening process which is critical for selecting the right scFvs for further studies. Present strategy leads to the identification of a scFv, B8 that binds specifically with nanomolar affinity towards SARS CoV 2 RBD, which otherwise lost in terms of traditional methodology.

Because it has been proposed that the immune system is stimulated by alarm signals called damage-associated molecular patterns or alarmins, we investigated the participation of uric acid and high-mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1) in the autoimmune response elicited by mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). Mice subjected to MHV infection had increased plasmatic uric acid concentration that significantly decreased after 20 days of daily treatment with allopurinol and, simultaneously, autoAb to FAH were undetected. Furthermore, this autoAb disappeared after 30 days of treatment with ethyl pyruvate, along with a substantial reduction in serum HMGB1 concentration. Both results indicated a remarkable relationship between the autoimmune process induced by the virus and uric acid and HMGB1 liberation. Unexpectedly, it was found that allopurinol and ethyl pyruvate inhibited the release of both uric acid and HMGB1. Because HMGB1 is activated through binding to interleukin 1β, and that this cytokine is produced by the NLRP3 inflammasome that could be stimulated by uric acid, we propose that both alarmins could be acting in concert with the induction of the autoAb to FAH in MHV-infected mice.","Duhalde-Vega, Maite; Retegui, Lilia A",Autoimmunity,https://doi.org/10.3109/08916934.2011.579927; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21604970/,336

These features are reminiscent of several adverse reactions triggered by angiotensin II, and opposed by angiotensin1-7, in many experimental models. SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 receptors and entries into the cell through the fusion of its membrane with that of the cell. Hence, it down-regulates these receptors. The loss of ACE2 receptor activity from the external site of the membrane will lead to less angiotensin II inactivation and less generation of antiotensin1-7. In various experimental models of lung injury, the imbalance between angiotensin II over-activity and of antiotensin1-7 deficiency triggered inflammation, thrombosis and other adverse reactions. In COVID-19, such imbalance could play an important role in influencing the clinical picture and outcome of the disease.

The keywords used were ""diabetes,"" ""plant,"" ""herb,"" ""neurodegenerative,"" ""neurodegeneration,"" ""cognitive,"" ""cognition,"" ""Alzheimer,"" ""dementia."" The non-English articles, repetitive articles and review studies were excluded. From total of 3,590 results, 58 articles are included in the study. The results show that many chemical treatments considered for this disease simply control hyperglycemia, but cannot improve the complications of diabetes. Herbal medicine could be more effective due to the high antioxidant activity of some medicinal plants. Biologically active substances of medicinal plants can improve the neurological disorders caused by diabetes via several pathways. The most important pathway is related to antioxidant properties. Other pathways include antiinflammatory, anti-apoptotic, neurotoxicity inhibition, neuronal death, increasing the uptake of glucose by cells and improve neurotransmitters levels involved in learning and memory.","Khazaei, Hosna; Pesce, Mirko; Patruno, Antonia; Aneva, Ina Y; Farzaei, Mohammad H",Phytotherapy research : PTR,https://doi.org/10.1002/ptr.6903; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33079410/,336
77464,"Social care: Promise to propose reforms later this year is far from reassuring, says committee chair.",2021-01-29,"BACKGROUND The objective of the present study was to evaluate costs for thyroidectomy performed with the aid of intraoperative neural monitoring (IONM), which has gained widespread acceptance during thyroid surgery as an adjunct to the gold standard of visual nerve identification. METHODS Through a micro-costing approach, the thyroidectomy patient-care process (with and without IONM) was analyzed by considering direct costs (staff time, consumables, equipment, drugs, operating room, and general expenses). Unit costs were collected from hospital accounting and standard tariff lists. To assess the impact of the IONM technology on hospital management, three macro-scenarios were considered: (1) traditional thyroidectomy; (2) thyroidectomy with IONM in a high-volume setting (5 procedures per week); and (3) thyroidectomy with IONM in a low-volume setting (1 procedure per week). Energy-based devices (EBD) for hemostasis and dissection in thyroidectomy were also evaluated, as well as the reimbursement made by the Italian Healthcare System on the basis of diagnosis related groups (DRGs), about €2,600. RESULTS Comparison between costs and the DRG fee shows an underfunding of total hospitalization costs for all thyroidectomies, regardless of IONM use (scenario 1: €3,471). The main cost drivers are consumables and technologies (25%), operating room (16%), and staff (14%). Hospitalization costs for a thyroidectomy with IONM range from €3,713 to €3,770 (scenarios 2 and 3), 5–7% higher than those for traditional thyroidectomy. Major economic differences emerge when an EBD is used (€3,969). CONCLUSIONS The regional DRG tariff for thyroid surgery is barely sufficient to cover conventional surgery costs. Intraoperative neural monitoring accounts for 5–7% of the hospitalization costs for a thyroidectomy.","Dionigi, Gianlorenzo; Bacuzzi, Alessandro; Boni, Luigi; Rausei, Stefano; Rovera, Francesca; Dionigi, Renzo",World journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-012-1452-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22297627/,336

Here, we investigate for the first time the quantitative proteomic profiles of B-cells undergoing antigen-dependent maturation using a label-free LC-MS/MS approach applied on 5 purified B-cell subpopulations (naive, centroblasts, centrocytes, memory and plasma B-cells) from human tonsils (data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD006191). Our results revealed that the actual differences among these B-cell subpopulations are a combination of expression of a few maturation stage-specific proteins within each B-cell subset and maturation-associated changes in relative protein expression levels, which are related with metabolic regulation. The considerable overlap of the proteome of the 5 studied B-cell subsets strengthens the key role of the regulation of the stoichiometry of molecules associated with metabolic regulation and programming, among other signaling cascades (such as antigen recognition and presentation and cell survival) crucial for the transition between each B-cell maturation stage.","Díez, Paula; Pérez-Andrés, Martín; Bøgsted, Martin; Azkargorta, Mikel; García-Valiente, Rodrigo; Dégano, Rosa M; Blanco, Elena; Mateos-Gomez, Sheila; Bárcena, Paloma; Santa Cruz, Santiago; Góngora, Rafael; Elortza, Félix; Landeira-Viñuela, Alicia; Juanes-Velasco, Pablo; Segura, Victor; Manzano-Román, Raúl; Almeida, Julia; Dybkaer, Karen; Orfao, Alberto; Fuentes, Manuel",Frontiers in immunology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.637832; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33859640/,336

79932,A review of mechanistic models of viral dynamics in bat reservoirs for zoonotic disease.,2020-11-13,"Bunyaviruses are significant human pathogens, causing diseases ranging from hemorrhagic fevers to encephalitis. Among these viruses, La Crosse virus (LACV), a member of the California serogroup, circulates in the eastern and midwestern United States. While LACV infection is often asymptomatic, dozens of cases of encephalitis are reported yearly. Unfortunately, no antivirals have been approved to treat LACV infection. Here, we developed a method to rapidly test potential antivirals against LACV infection. From this screen, we identified several potential antiviral molecules, including known antivirals. Additionally, we identified many novel antivirals that exhibited antiviral activity without affecting cellular viability. Valinomycin, a potassium ionophore, was among our top targets. We found that valinomycin exhibited potent anti-LACV activity in multiple cell types in a dose-dependent manner. Valinomycin did not affect particle stability or infectivity, suggesting that it may preclude virus replication by altering cellular potassium ions, a known determinant of LACV entry. We extended these results to other ionophores and found that the antiviral activity of valinomycin extended to other viral families including bunyaviruses (Rift Valley fever virus, Keystone virus), enteroviruses (Coxsackievirus, rhinovirus), flavirivuses (Zika), and coronaviruses (HCoV-229E and MERS-CoV). In all viral infections, we observed significant reductions in virus titer in valinomycin-treated cells. In sum, we demonstrate the importance of potassium ions to virus infection, suggesting a potential therapeutic target to disrupt virus replication.Importance No antivirals are approved for the treatment of bunyavirus infection. The ability to rapidly screen compounds and identify novel antivirals is one means to accelerate drug discovery for viruses with no approved treatments. We used this approach to screen hundreds of compounds against La Crosse virus, an emerging bunyavirus that causes significant disease, including encephalitis. We identified several known and previously unidentified antivirals. We focused on a potassium ionophore, valinomycin, due to its promising in vitro antiviral activity. We demonstrate that valinomycin, as well as a selection of other ionophores, exhibits activity against La Crosse virus as well as several other distantly related bunyaviruses. We finally observe that valinomycin has activity against a wide array of human viral pathogens, suggesting that disrupting potassium ion homeostasis with valinomycin may be a potent host pathway to target to quell virus infection.","Sandler, Zachary J; Firpo, Mason R; Omoba, Oreoluwa S; Vu, Michelle N; Menachery, Vineet D; Mounce, Bryan C",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1128/aac.00086-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32284379/,336

80112,Social Isolation-the Other COVID-19 Threat in Nursing Homes.,2020-07-16,"OBJECTIVES To provide an editorial introduction to the 2015 IMIA Yearbook of Medical Informatics. METHODS We provide a brief overview of the 2015 special topic ""Patient-Centered Care Coordination"", discuss the addition of two new sections to the Yearbook, Natural Language Processing and Public Health & Epidemiology Informatics, and present our editorial plans for the upcoming celebration of the 25th anniversary of the Yearbook. RESULTS Care delivery currently occurs through the processing of complex clinical pathways designed for increasingly multi-morbid patients by various practitioners in different settings. To avoid the consequences of the fragmentation of services, care should be organized to coordinate all providers, giving them the opportunity to share the same holistic view of the patient's condition, and to be informed of the planned clinical pathway that establishes the roles and interventions of each one. The adoption and use of electronic health records (EHRs) is a solution to address health information sharing and care coordination challenges. However, while EHRs are necessary, they are not sufficient to achieve care coordination, creating information availability does not mean the information will be accessed. This edition of the Yearbook acknowledges the fact that health information technology (HIT), and EHRs in particular, are not yet fully addressing the challenges in care coordination. Emerging trends, tools, and applications of HIT to support care coordination are presented through the keynote paper, survey papers, and working group contributions. CONCLUSIONS In 2015, the IMIA Yearbook has been extended to emphasize two fields of biomedical informatics through new sections. Next year, the 25th anniversary of the Yearbook will be celebrated in grand style!

81441,Using video consultations to support family carers of people living with dementia.,2021-08-25,"Premature infants in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) are highly susceptible to infection due to the immaturity of their immune systems, and nosocomial infections are a significant risk factor for death and poor neurodevelopmental outcome in this population. To investigate the impact of cleaning within a NICU, a high-throughput short-amplicon-sequencing approach was used to profile bacterial and fungal surface communities before and after cleaning. Intensive cleaning of surfaces in contact with neonates decreased the total bacterial load and the percentage of Streptococcus species with similar trends for total fungal load and Staphylococcus species; this may have clinical relevance since staphylococci and streptococci are the most common causes of nosocomial NICU infections. Surfaces generally had low levels of other taxa containing species that commonly cause nosocomial infections (e.g., Enterobacteriaceae) that were not significantly altered with cleaning. Several opportunistic yeasts were detected in the NICU environment, demonstrating that these NICU surfaces represent a potential vector for spreading fungal pathogens. These results underline the importance of routine cleaning as a means of managing the microbial ecosystem of NICUs and of future opportunities to minimize exposures of vulnerable neonates to potential pathogens and to use amplicon-sequencing tools for microbial surveillance and hygienic testing in hospital environments.","Bokulich, Nicholas A; Mills, David A; Underwood, Mark A",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.00898-13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23740726/,336

83777,"Personality Traits, Media Exposure, and Deterioration of Psychological Wellbeing in Japan During the COVID-19 Pandemic.",2021-09-24,"BACKGROUND AND AIM Monitoring bioelectric phase angle (PhA) provides important information on the health and the condition of the athlete. Together with the vector length, PhA constitutes the bioimpedance vector analysis (BIVA) patterns, and their joint interpretation exceeds the limits of the evaluation of the PhA alone. The present investigation aimed to monitor changes in the BIVA patterns during a training macrocycle in swimmers, trying to ascertain if these parameters are sensitive to training load changes across a 13-week training period. METHODS Twelve national and international level swimmers (four females; eight males; 20.9 ± 1.9 years; with a competitive swimming background of 11.3 ± 1.8 years; undertaking 16-20 h of pool training and 4-5 h of dry-land training per week and 822.0 ± 59.0 International Swimming Federation (FINA) points) were evaluated for resistance (R) and reactance (Xc) using a single frequency phase sensitive bioimpedance device at the beginning of the macrocycle (M1), just before the beginning of the taper period (M2), and just before the main competition of the macrocycle (M3). At the three-time assessment points, swimmers also performed a 50 m all-out first stroke sprint with track start (T50 m) while time was recorded. RESULTS The results of the Hotelling T2 test showed a significant vector displacement due to simultaneous R and Xc changes (p < 0.001), where shifting from top to bottom along the major axis of the R-Xc graph from M1 to M2 was observed. From M2 to M3, a vector displacement up and left along the minor axis of the tolerance ellipses resulted in an increase in PhA (p < 0.01). The results suggest a gain in fluid with a decrease in cellular density from M1 to M2 due to decrements in R and Xc. Nevertheless, the reduced training load characterizing taper seemed to allow for an increase in PhA and, most importantly, an increase of Xc, thus demonstrating improved cellular health and physical condition, which was concomitant with a significant increase in the T50 m performance (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS PhA, obtained by bioelectrical R and Xc, can be useful in monitoring the condition of swimmers preparing for competition. Monitoring BIVA patterns allows for an ecological approach to the swimmers' health and condition assessment without resorting to equations to predict the related body composition variables.","Reis, Joana F; Matias, Catarina N; Campa, Francesco; Morgado, José P; Franco, Paulo; Quaresma, Pedro; Almeida, Nuno; Curto, Dalia; Toselli, Stefania; Monteiro, Cristina P",International journal of environmental research and public health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17134851; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32640533/,336
84842,Challenge of optimising medication in people with severe mental illness.,2021-09-23,"The glucocorticoid receptor is an important immunosuppressive drug target and metabolic regulator that acts as a ligand-gated transcription factor. Generally, GR's anti-inflammatory effects are attributed to the silencing of inflammatory genes, while its adverse effects are ascribed to the upregulation of metabolic targets. GR binding directly to DNA is proposed to activate, whereas GR tethering to pro-inflammatory transcription factors is thought to repress transcription. Using mice with a point mutation in GR's zinc finger, that still tether via protein-protein interactions while being unable to recognize DNA, we demonstrate that DNA binding is essential for both transcriptional activation and repression. Performing ChIP-Seq, RNA-Seq and proteomics under inflammatory conditions, we show that DNA recognition is required for the assembly of a functional co-regulator complex to mediate glucocorticoid responses. Our findings may contribute to the development of safer immunomodulators with fewer side effects.","Escoter-Torres, Laura; Greulich, Franziska; Quagliarini, Fabiana; Wierer, Michael; Uhlenhaut, Nina Henriette",Nucleic acids research,https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkaa565; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32619221/,336
85692,"Adult social care in England: more disappointment, delay, and distraction.",2021-09-14,"AbstractThe limitations that hypoxia imparts on mitochondrial oxygen supply are circumvented by the activation of anaerobic metabolism and prosurvival mechanisms in hypoxia-tolerant animals. To deal with the hypoxia that jumbo squid (Dosidicus gigas) experience in the ocean's depth, they depress their metabolic rate by up to 52% relative to normoxic conditions. This is coupled with molecular reorganization to facilitate their daily descents into the ocean's oxygen minimum zone, where they face not only low oxygen levels but also higher pressures and colder frigid waters. Our current study explores the tissue-specific hypoxia responses of three central processes: (1) antioxidant enzymes responsible for defending against oxidative stress, (2) early apoptotic machinery that signals the activation of cell death, and (3) mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) that act as central regulators of numerous cellular processes. Luminex xMAP technology was used to assess protein levels and phosphorylation states under normoxic and hypoxic conditions in brains, branchial hearts, and mantle muscles. Hypoxic brains were found to activate apoptosis via upregulation of phospho-p38, phospho-p53, activated caspase 8, and activated caspase 9, whereas branchial hearts were the only tissue to show an increase in antioxidant enzyme levels. Hypoxic muscles seemed the least affected by hypoxia. Our results suggest that hypoxic squid do not undergo large dynamic changes in the phosphorylation states of key apoptotic and central MAPK factors, except for brains, suggesting that these mechanisms are involved in squid hypometabolic responses.","Gupta, Aakriti; Hadj-Moussa, Hanane; Al-Attar, Rasha; Seibel, Brad A; Storey, Kenneth B",Physiological and biochemical zoology : PBZ,https://doi.org/10.1086/714097; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33830886/,336

Severe treatment-related diarrhea may result in chemotherapy discontinuation. We investigated the relationship between diarrhea severity and fluoropyrimidine-induced small intestinal mucosal injury. METHODS We performed small bowel capsule endoscopy in patients undergoing chemotherapy including fluoropyrimidine for a malignant tumor between May 2017 and June 2018 and analyzed the relationship between the endoscopic findings and diarrhea severity. We also performed a cross-sectional analysis of patient factors and routes of chemotherapy to identify risk factors of fluoropyrimidine-induced small intestinal injury. RESULTS Small bowel capsule endoscopy was successfully completed in 16 eligible patients. The diarrhea grade (per the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0) was significantly correlated with the percentage of patients with a small intestinal mucosal break (grade 0, 16.7%; grade 1, 57.1%; grade 2, 100%; p = .016, Cochran-Armitage trend test). Compared to patients receiving intravenous therapy, those receiving an orally administered fluoropyrimidine had a significantly greater number of small intestinal mucosal breaks (median number of breaks [range]; intravenous 5-fluorouracil, 0 [0-13]; oral fluoropyrimidine, 6.5 [1-20]; p = .0162, Mann-Whitney U test). CONCLUSIONS Many patients with diarrhea caused by chemotherapy including fluoropyrimidine had small intestinal mucosal breaks. Additionally, small intestinal mucosal breaks were more severe in patients receiving a regimen of oral treatment than in those receiving a regimen of intravenous therapy.

This study explored the inflammatory mediators in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) for prognostic relevance in patients with infection-induced ARDS. Thirty-nine patients with infection-induced ARDS (28 pneumonia and 11 extrapulmonary sepsis) and two patients with cardiogenic lung edema as the control were included. The expression profiles of inflammatory mediators in BALF were compared between ARDS and cardiogenic lung edema. A group of inflammatory mediators that showed higher expression in ARDS was analyzed for their relationships with clinical features and outcome. We found that 17 patients who died had higher levels of interleukin (IL)-6 (P = 0.012), IL-8 (P = 0.001) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (P = 0.036) in BALF compared with those who survived. Furthermore, there was an inverse relationship between the BALF levels of IL-6 (P = 0.026), IL-8 (P = 0.008) and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 alpha (P = 0.048) and the changes of lung compliance between days 1 and 4, whereas the BALF levels of IL-8 (P = 0.033) and MIP-1 alpha (P = 0.029) were positively correlated with the changes of sequential organ failure assessment scores between days 1 and 4. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, only IL-8 (P = 0.013) and lung injury score (LIS) (P = 0.017) independently predicted the mortality, and IL-8 (P = 0.002) was most likely predictive of mortality in analysis of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. In conclusion, we show the expression profiles of inflammatory mediators in BALF of infection-induced ARDS. Among the mediators, IL-8 is the most significant predictor for mortality, and several mediators are correlated with clinical severity. However, potential selection bias due to limited control subjects and lack of serum inflammatory mediator data suggest a necessity of further studies to confirm our findings.","Lin, Wei-Chieh; Lin, Chiou-Feng; Chen, Chia-Ling; Chen, Chang-Wen; Lin, Yee-Shin",Experimental biology and medicine,https://doi.org/10.1258/ebm.2009.009256; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20404020/,336

This report evaluates the psychometric properties of a brief self- and clinician-rated measure of factors related to the risk of suicide attempt or completion. METHOD Adult outpatients with nonpsychotic major depressive disorder (MDD) (n = 240) were enrolled from July 2007 through February 2008 and treated in an 8-week, open-label trial with the clinician's choice of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor at 6 primary care and 9 psychiatric clinical care settings in the National Institute of Mental Health-funded Depression Trials Network. Diagnosis of MDD was determined by the Psychiatric Diagnostic Screening Questionnaire and an MDD checklist based on DSM-IV-TR criteria. Suicidal ideation and behavior are 1 of 9 symptoms of MDD (depressed mood, loss of interest, appetite or weight change, sleep disturbance, reduced concentration or indecisiveness, fatigue or decreased energy, psychomotor agitation or retardation, feelings of worthlessness, or excessive guilt). The newly developed Concise Health Risk Tracking (CHRT) scale was administered both as the CHRT Self-Report (CHRT-SR) and Clinician Rating (CHRT-C) scales. Psychometric evaluations were conducted on both scales. RESULTS The internal consistency (Cronbach α) was .77 for the 7-item CHRT-C and .78 for the 7-item CHRT-SR with a consistent factor structure, and 3 independent factors (current suicidal thoughts and plans, perceived lack of social support, and hopelessness) for both versions. CONCLUSIONS The 7-item CHRT-C and the 7-item CHRT-SR have excellent psychometric properties and can be used to monitor suicidal risk in clinical practice and research settings. Whether either scale will predict suicide attempts or completions in actual practice would require a very large prospective study sample.

To improve the rehabilitation effectiveness of post-stroke patients, we developed a sensory stimulation-based continuous passive motion (CPM)-MT system with two different operating protocols, that is, asynchronous and synchronous modes. To evaluate their effectiveness, we measured brain activation through relative and absolute power spectral density (PSD) changes of electroencephalogram (EEG) mu rhythm in three cases with CMT and CPM-MT with asynchronous and synchronous modes. We also monitored changes in muscle fatigue, which is one of the negative effects of the CPM device, based on median power frequency (MPF) and root mean square (RMS). Relative PSD was most suppressed when subjects used the CPM-MT system under synchronous control: 22.11%, 15.31%, and 16.48% on Cz, C3, and C4, respectively. The absolute average changes in MPF and RMS were 1.59% and 9.78%, respectively, with CPM-MT. Synchronous mode CPM-MT is the most effective method for brain activation, and muscle fatigue caused by the CPM-MT system was negligible. This study suggests the more effective combination rehabilitation system for MT by utilizing CPM and magnetic-based MT task to add action execution and sensory stimulation compared with CMT.","Park, Taewoong; Lee, Mina; Jeong, Taejong; Shin, Yong-Il; Park, Sung-Min",Sensors,https://doi.org/10.3390/s20082354; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32326195/,336
90632,Foreword to special COVID-19 edition for Irish Journal of Psychological Medicine.,2020-09-01,"A mathematical model is designed and used to study the transmission dynamics and control of COVID-19 in Nigeria. The model, which was rigorously analysed and parametrized using COVID-19 data published by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), was used to assess the community-wide impact of various control and mitigation strategies in some jurisdictions within Nigeria (notably the states of Kano and Lagos, and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja). Numerical simulations of the model showed that COVID-19 can be effectively controlled in Nigeria using moderate levels of social-distancing strategy in the jurisdictions and in the entire nation. Although the use of face masks in public can significantly reduce COVID-19 in Nigeria, its use, as a sole intervention strategy, may fail to lead to a substantial reduction in disease burden. Such substantial reduction is feasible in the jurisdictions (and the entire Nigerian nation) if the public face mask use strategy is complemented with a social-distancing strategy. The community lockdown measures implemented in Nigeria on March 30, 2020 need to be maintained for at least three to four months to lead to the effective containment of COVID-19 outbreaks in the country. Relaxing, or fully lifting, the lockdown measures sooner, in an effort to re-open the economy or the country, may trigger a deadly second wave of the pandemic.","Iboi, Enahoro A; Sharomi, Oluwaseun; Ngonghala, Calistus N; Gumel, Abba B",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,https://doi.org/10.3934/mbe.2020369; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33378893/,336

METHOD The Plan-Do-Study-Act model was used. Survey data from providers and families were collected and analyzed. They were further illuminated through iterative dialog across the research team to determine the quality and efficiency of TH. RESULTS A toolkit of strategies for promoting the quality and efficiency of TH was created according to the three domains of health equity: availability, accessibility, and acceptability. DISCUSSION TH will be used in the postpandemic era. Institutions need to implement evidence-based strategies that ensure health equity across TH platforms to ensure excellent patient care.","Serino-Cipoletta, Jessica; Dempsey, Catherine; Goldberg, Nancy; Marinaccio, Barbara; O'Malley, Kimberli; Dolan, Caitlin; Parker-Hartigan, Lori; Williams, Lucinda; Vessey, Judith A",Journal of pediatric health care : official publication of National Association of Pediatric Nurse Associates & Practitioners,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pedhc.2021.01.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34172354/,336
91812,The Fear of COVID-19 Scale: A Reliability Generalization Meta-Analysis.,2021-02-22,"BACKGROUND The epidemiology of human coronaviruses (HCoVs) has not been established using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction techniques in a specimen collection that spans decades. METHODS We used real-time RT-PCR for 3 HCoVs, HCoV 229E, OC43, and NL63, to test nasal wash specimens that had been obtained from a cohort of children <5 years of age with upper or lower respiratory infection (URI, LRI) who were comprehensively followed during the period from 1977 to 2001. Prospectively collected clinical data and archival samples were analyzed. RESULTS HCoV was detected in 92/1854 (5.0%) of available samples with no known viral etiology of which 9% were 229E, 59% OC43, and 33% NL63. This represented 10/119 (8.4%) of LRI samples and 82/1735 (4.7%) of URI samples. HCoV was not detected every year, but occurred episodically. The recently described HCoV-NL63 was detected as early as 1981. HCoV was associated with 11.4 LRI episodes/1000 child-years <5 years of age (all in children <2 years of age) and 67.3 URI episodes/1000 child-years <5 years of age. CONCLUSIONS HCoV-NL63 and OC43 are associated with a significant proportion of LRI in children less than 2 years of age and a substantial number of medically attended URI episodes.","Talbot, H Keipp; Shepherd, Bryan E; Crowe, James E; Griffin, Marie R; Edwards, Kathryn M; Podsiad, Amy B; Tollefson, Sharon J; Wright, Peter F; Williams, John V",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0b013e31819d0d27; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19633513/,336
92213,COVID-19 Concerns Among Persons With Mental Illness.,2020-09-03,"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effectiveness and clinical utility of a metal artifact reduction (MAR) image reconstruction algorithm for the reduction of high-attenuation object (HAO)-related image artifacts. METHODS Images were quantitatively evaluated for image noise (noiseSD and noiserange) and qualitatively for artifact severity, gray-white-matter delineation, and diagnostic confidence with conventional reconstruction and after applying a MAR algorithm. RESULTS Metal artifact reduction reduces noiseSD and noiserange (median [interquartile range]) at the level of HAO in 1-cm distance compared with conventional reconstruction (noiseSD: 60.0 [71.4] vs 12.8 [16.1] and noiserange: 262.0 [236.8] vs 72.0 [28.3]; P < 0.0001). Artifact severity (reader 1 [mean ± SD]: 1.1 ± 0.6 vs 2.4 ± 0.5, reader 2: 0.8 ± 0.6 vs 2.0 ± 0.4) at level of HAO and diagnostic confidence (reader 1: 1.6 ± 0.7 vs 2.6 ± 0.5, reader 2: 1.0 ± 0.6 vs 2.3 ± 0.7) significantly improved with MAR (P < 0.0001). Metal artifact reduction did not affect gray-white-matter delineation. CONCLUSIONS Metal artifact reduction effectively reduces image artifacts caused by HAO and significantly improves diagnostic confidence without worsening gray-white-matter delineation.","Naehle, Claas P; Hechelhammer, Lukas; Richter, Heiko; Ryffel, Fabian; Wildermuth, Simon; Weber, Johannes",Journal of computer assisted tomography,https://doi.org/10.1097/rct.0000000000000575; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28240633/,336

Several antivirals are being investigated for symptomatic COVID-19 but no definitive data support their clinical use. Remdesivir, with good in vitro activity against SARS-CoV2, appeared to result in favorable outcomes for hospitalized patients in a compassionate use series with shortened time to recovery and a modest decrease in mortality. Currently, remdesivir is available in phase III clinical trials, the compassionate use program, and eventually through the emergency use authorization. A randomized controlled trial of lopinavir/ritonavir demonstrated no apparent clinical or virologic benefit and drug-drug interactions and side effects further limit its utility. Antivirals to treat influenza (oseltamivir) have limited activity against SARS-CoV-2, but favipiravir and umifenovir, influenza antivirals available internationally, have distinct viral targets and require further investigation.

Objective The objective of the study was to assess the impact of comorbidities on the case fatality rate (CFR) and the development of adverse events in patients positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the Mexican population. Materials and methods We analyzed the data from 13,842 laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients in Mexico between January 1, 2020, and April 25, 2020. We investigated the risk of death and the development of adverse events (hospitalization, pneumonia, orotracheal intubation, and intensive care unit [ICU] admission), comparing the number of comorbidities of each patient. Results The patient mean age was 46.6 ± 15.6 years, 42.3% (n = 5853) of the cases were women, 38.8% of patients were hospitalized, 4.4% were intubated, 29.6% developed pneumonia, and 4.4% had critical illness. The CFR was 9.4%. The risk of hospitalization (odds ratio [OR] = 3.1, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.7-3.7), pneumonia (OR = 3.02, 95% CI: 2.6-3.5), ICU admission (OR = 2, 95% CI: 1.5-2.7), and CFR (hazard ratio = 3.5, 95% CI: 2.9-4.2) was higher in patients with three or more comorbidities than in patients with 1, 2, or with no comorbidities.

96026,Development and testing of a frailty-focused communication (FCOM) aid for older adults.,2020-07-21,"BACKGROUND Promoter hypermethylation is common in Breast Cancer (BC) with studies mainly in histological specimens showing frequent methylation of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) compared with normal tissues. The aim of this study was to estimate the frequency of promoter methylation of RAR-β2 and RASSF1A genes in breast FNAB material aiming to evaluate the methylation status of these two genes as biomarker for detecting BC in Greek population. METHODS FNAB material from 104 patients was collected for cytological evaluation and epigenetic analysis. DNA was extracted and subjected to bisulfite conversion. A methylation-specific PCR was carried out and the final products were separated with electrophoresis in 2% agarose gels. RESULTS From 104 samples, RASSF1A hypermethylation was observed in 78 (75%) and RAR-β2 hypermethylation in 64 (61.6%). 84% and 78% of the cases diagnosed with breast malignancy (n = 50) were methylated for RASSF1A and RAR-β2, respectively. Methylated RASSF1A and RAR-β2 were also detected in 88.3% and 76.5% in samples diagnosed as suspicious for malignancy (n = 17) and in 57.2% of samples diagnosed with atypia (n = 14). The Odds Ratio for breast malignancy was 4.545 in patients with RASSF1A hypermethylation and 9.167 in patients with RAR-β2 hypermethylation underlying their promoter's methylation positive correlation with breast malignancy. CONCLUSION To optimize the sensitivity and specificity of this epigenetic setting, more TSGs related to BC should be gradually imported in our evaluated methylation panel and be validated in a larger study sample with the aim that the obtained epigenetic profiles will provide clinicians with valuable tools for management of BC patients in Greece.","Kougioumtsidou, Niki; Vavoulidis, Eleftherios; Nasioutziki, Maria; Symeonidou, Marianthi; Pratilas, Georgios Chrysostomos; Mareti, Evangelia; Petousis, Stamatios; Chatzikyriakidou, Anthoula; Grimbizis, Gregorios; Theodoridis, Theodoros; Miliaras, Dimosthenis; Dinas, Konstantinos; Zepiridis, Leonidas",Diagnostic cytopathology,https://doi.org/10.1002/dc.24513; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32530576/,336

There is limited guidance about how to achieve such alignment. PURPOSE To describe the range of values clarification methods available to patient decision aid developers, synthesize evidence regarding their relative merits, and foster collection of evidence by offering researchers a proposed set of outcomes to report when evaluating the effects of values clarification methods. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, and CINAHL. STUDY SELECTION We included articles that described randomized trials of 1 or more explicit values clarification methods. From 30,648 records screened, we identified 33 articles describing trials of 43 values clarification methods. DATA EXTRACTION Two independent reviewers extracted details about each values clarification method and its evaluation. DATA SYNTHESIS Compared to control conditions or to implicit values clarification methods, explicit values clarification methods decreased the frequency of values-incongruent choices (risk difference, -0.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.06 to -0.02; P < 0.001) and decisional conflict (standardized mean difference, -0.20; 95% CI, -0.29 to -0.11; P < 0.001). Multicriteria decision analysis led to more values-congruent decisions than other values clarification methods (χ2 = 9.25, P = 0.01). There were no differences between different values clarification methods regarding decisional conflict (χ2 = 6.08, P = 0.05). LIMITATIONS Some meta-analyses had high heterogeneity. We grouped values clarification methods into broad categories. CONCLUSIONS Current evidence suggests patient decision aids should include an explicit values clarification method. Developers may wish to specifically consider multicriteria decision analysis. Future evaluations of values clarification methods should report their effects on decisional conflict, decisions made, values congruence, and decisional regret.","Witteman, Holly O; Ndjaboue, Ruth; Vaisson, Gratianne; Dansokho, Selma Chipenda; Arnold, Bob; Bridges, John F P; Comeau, Sandrine; Fagerlin, Angela; Gavaruzzi, Teresa; Marcoux, Melina; Pieterse, Arwen; Pignone, Michael; Provencher, Thierry; Racine, Charles; Regier, Dean; Rochefort-Brihay, Charlotte; Thokala, Praveen; Weernink, Marieke; White, Douglas B; Wills, Celia E; Jansen, Jesse",Medical decision making : an international journal of the Society for Medical Decision Making,https://doi.org/10.1177/0272989x211037946; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34565196/,336

Current methods are often limited by subjective assessments, inability to detect pathogen growth prior to appearance of symptoms, destructive sampling, or limited capacity for replication and quantitative analysis. In this work we sought to develop a real-time, in vivo, high-throughput assay that would allow for quantification of pathogen growth. To establish such a system, we worked with the broad host-range, highly destructive, soil-borne oomycete pathogen, Phytophthora capsici. We used an isolate expressing red fluorescence protein (RFP) to establish a microtiter plate, real-time assay to quantify pathogen growth in live tissue. The system was successfully used to monitor P. capsici growth in planta on cucumber (Cucumis sativus) fruit and pepper (Capsicum annuum) leaf samples in relation to different levels of host susceptibility. These results demonstrate usefulness of the method in different species and tissue types, allowing for highly replicated, quantitative time-course measurements of pathogen growth in vivo. Analyses of pathogen growth during initial stages of infection preceding symptom development show the importance of very early stages of infection in determining disease outcome, and provide insight into points of inhibition of pathogen growth in different resistance systems.","Zhang, Chunqiu; Mansfeld, Ben N; Lin, Ying-Chen; Grumet, Rebecca",Frontiers in plant science,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2021.637190; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33643365/,336

MATERIALS AND METHODS Three piglets corresponding to common pediatric population sizes were used. DSA was performed in the aorta and renal, hepatic, and superior mesenteric arteries using both the commonly used reference standard and novel radiographic imaging noise reduction technologies to ensure pairwise radiation dose and image quality comparison. The air kerma per frame at the interventional reference point for each DSA acquisition was collected as a radiation dose measure, and image quality was evaluated by five interventional radiologists in a randomized blinded fashion using a 5-point scale. RESULTS The mean air kerma (± SD) at the interventional reference point with the novel x-ray imaging noise reduction technology was significantly lower (1.1 ± 0.8 mGy/frame) than with the reference technology (4.2 ± 3.0 mGy/frame, p = 0.005). However, image quality was statistically similar, with average scores of 3.2 ± 0.4 and 3.1 ± 0.5 for the novel and reference technologies, respectively (p = 0.934); interrater absolute agreement was 0.77. CONCLUSION The DSA radiation dose for pediatrics can be reduced by a factor of four with a novel x-ray imaging noise reduction technology without deterioration of image quality.","Racadio, John; Strauss, Keith; Abruzzo, Todd; Patel, Manish; Kukreja, Kamlesh; Johnson, Neil; den Hartog, Mark; Hoornaert, Bart; Nachabe, Rami",AJR.

We developed approaches to investigate NS5A dynamics during a productive infection. We report here that NS5A motility and efficient HCV RNA replication require the microtubule network and the cytoplasmic motor dynein and demonstrate that both motile and relatively static NS5A-positive foci are enriched with host factors VAP-A and Rab5A. Pulse-chase imaging revealed that newly synthesized NS5A foci are small and distinct from aged foci, while further studies using a unique dual fluorescently tagged infectious HCV chimera showed a relatively stable association of NS5A foci with core-capped LDs. These results reveal new details about the dynamics and maturation of NS5A and the nature of potential sites of convergence of HCV replication and assembly pathways. IMPORTANCE Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of serious liver disease worldwide. An improved understanding of the HCV replication cycle will enable development of novel and improved antiviral strategies. Here we have developed complementary fluorescent labeling and imaging approaches to investigate the localization, traffic and interactions of the HCV NS5A protein in living, virus-producing cells. These studies reveal new details as to the traffic, composition and biogenesis of NS5A foci and the nature of their association with putative sites of virus assembly.","Eyre, Nicholas S; Fiches, Guillaume N; Aloia, Amanda L; Helbig, Karla J; McCartney, Erin M; McErlean, Christopher S P; Li, Kui; Aggarwal, Anupriya; Turville, Stuart G; Beard, Michael R",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02490-13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24429364/,336

99828,What Do We Over-look During COVID-19 Pandemic? An Adolescent Stroke Case Presumed Conversion Disorder.,2020,"BACKGROUND Wound infection is a common complication following caesarean section. Factors influencing the risk of infection may include the suture material for skin closure, and closure of the subcutaneous fascia. We assessed the effect of skin closure with absorbable versus non-absorbable suture, and closure versus non-closure of the subcutaneous fascia on risk of wound infection following Caesarean section. METHODS Women undergoing caesarean birth at an Adelaide maternity hospital were eligible for recruitment to a randomised trial using a 2 × 2 factorial design. Women were randomised to either closure or non-closure of the subcutaneous fascia and to subcuticular skin closure with an absorbable or non-absorbable suture. Participants were randomised to each of the two interventions into one of 4 possible groups: Group 1 - non-absorbable skin suture and non-closure of the subcutaneous fascia; Group 2 - absorbable skin suture and non-closure of the subcutaneous fascia; Group 3 - non-absorbable skin suture and closure of the subcutaneous fascia; and Group 4 - absorbable skin suture and closure of the subcutaneous fascia. The primary outcomes were reported wound infection and wound haematoma or seroma within the first 30 days after birth. RESULTS A total of 851 women were recruited and randomised, with 849 women included in the analyses (Group 1: 216 women; Group 2: 212 women; Group 3: 212 women; Group 4: 211 women). In women who underwent fascia closure, there was a statistically significant increase in risk of wound infection within 30 days post-operatively for those who had skin closure with an absorbable suture (Group 4), compared with women who had skin closure with a non-absorbable suture (Group 3) (adjusted RR 2.17; 95% CI 1.05, 4.45; p = 0.035). There was no significant difference in risk of wound infection for absorbable vs non-absorbable sutures in women who did not undergo fascia closure. CONCLUSION The combination of subcutaneous fascia closure and skin closure with an absorbable suture may be associated with an increased risk of reported wound infection after caesarean section.

A 70-year-old man had a reconstruction of the pelvic floor with a biological mesh because of a perineal hernia after laparoscopic abdominoperineal resection. Nine months after the perineal hernia operation, the patient had multiple metastases in both lungs and liver. The patient underwent chemotherapy, including bevacizumab, irinotecan, calcium folinate, and fluorouracil. Six weeks into chemotherapy, the patient developed signs of sepsis and complained of pain from the right buttock. Ultrasound examination revealed an abscess, which was drained, guided by ultrasound. A computed tomography scan showed a subcutaneous abscess cavity located in the right buttock with communication to the small bowel. Operative findings confirmed a perineal fistula from the distal ileum to perineum. A resection of the small bowel with primary anastomosis was performed. The postoperative course was complicated by fluid and electrolyte disturbances, but the patient was stabilized and finally discharged to a hospice for terminal care after 28 days of hospital stay. It seems that hernia repairs with biological meshes have lower erosion and infection rates compared with synthetic meshes, and so far, evidence suggests that biological grafts are safe and effective in the treatment of pelvic floor reconstruction. There have been no reports of enteric fistulas after pelvic reconstruction with biological meshes. However, the development of intestinal fistulas after chemotherapy with bevacizumab has been described in the literature. Our case report supports this association between bevacizumab and fistula formation among rectal cancer patients, as symptoms of a fistula started only 6 weeks into bevacizumab treatment but approximately 12 months after the perineal hernia operation, even after pelvic reconstruction using a biological mesh and without local recurrence.","Eriksen, Mh; Bulut, O",International medical case reports journal,https://doi.org/10.2147/imcrj.s54192; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24489478/,336

While healthcare organizations are seeking to improve the quality of care by integrating innovations in digital health, they must also address key issues such as patient experience, develop clinical decision support systems that analyze digital health data trends, and create efficient clinical workflows. Given the breadth of such requirements, embracing new technologies as a core competency of a modern healthcare system introduces a host of questions, such as ""How best do patients participate in digital health programs that promote behavioral changes and mitigate risk?"" and ""What type of data analytics are required that enable a deeper understanding of disease phenotypes and corresponding treatment decisions?"" This review presents the challenges in implementing digital health technology and discusses how patient-centered digital health programs are designed within real-world models of remote monitoring. It also provides a framework for developing new devices and wearables for the next generation of data-driven, technology-enabled cardiovascular care.","Bhavnani, Sanjeev P",Methodist DeBakey cardiovascular journal,https://doi.org/10.14797/mdcj-16-4-296; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33500758/,336

However, the exact mechanisms underlying the regulation of Parkin-mediated mitophagy in PD remain unclear. In this study, PD models were generated through incubation of SH-SY5Y cells with 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP+, 1.5 mM for 24 h) and intraperitoneal injections of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP, 30 mg/kg for five consecutive days) in mice. A Bioinformatics database was used to identify Parkin-targeting microRNAs (miRNAs). Then, miR-103a-3p agomir, miR-103a-3p antagomir and Parkin siRNA were used to assess the effects of miR-103a-3p/Parkin/Ambra1 signaling-mediated mitophagy in PD in vitro and in vivo. The protein and mRNA levels of Parkin and Ambra1 were significantly decreased, while miR-103a-3p, which is a highly expressed miRNA in the human brain, was obviously increased in PD mouse and SH-SY5Y cell models. Moreover, miR-103a-3p suppressed Parkin expression by targeting a conserved binding site in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of Parkin mRNA. Importantly, miR-103a-3p inhibition resulted in neuroprotective effects and improved mitophagy in vitro and in vivo, whereas Parkin siRNA strongly abolished these effects. These findings suggested that miR-103a-3p inhibition has neuroprotective effects in PD, which may be involved in regulating mitophagy through the Parkin/Ambra1 pathway. Modulating miR-103a-3p levels may be an applicable therapeutic strategy for PD.","Zhou, Junjun; Zhao, Yan; Li, Zhenlu; Zhu, Meiyang; Wang, Zhecheng; Li, Yang; Xu, Ting; Feng, Dongcheng; Zhang, Su; Tang, Fan; Yao, Jihong",Pharmacological research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2020.105197; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32942015/,336

METHOD MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL and Clinicaltrials.gov were searched for studies of any design that reported dehydration, renal function and dehydration-related morbidity in adult colorectal cancer patients with diverting ileostomy (last search 12/08/2020). Bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaborations tool for assessing risk of bias in randomised trials and the Risk Of Bias in Non-randomised studies of Interventions tools. RESULTS Of 1927 screened papers, 22 studies were included (21 cohort studies and one randomised trial) with a total of 19485 patients (12209 with ileostomy). Prevalence of dehydration was 9.00% (95% CI 5.31-13.45,p<0.001). Relative risk of dehydration following diverting ileostomy was 3.37 (95% CI 2.30-4.95, p<0.001). Three studies assessing long term trends in renal function demonstrated progressive renal impairment persisting beyond the initial insult. Consequences identified included unplanned readmission, delay or non-commencement of adjuvant chemotherapy, and development of chronic kidney disease. DISCUSSION Significant dehydration is common following diverting ileostomy and is linked to both acute kidney injury and has a long-term impact on renal function. This study suggests ileostomy confers significant morbidity particularly related to dehydration and renal impairment.","Borucki, Joseph P; Schlaeger, Sarah; Crane, Jasmine; Hernon, James M; Stearns, Adam T",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,https://doi.org/10.1111/codi.15654; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33783976/,336

MATERIALS AND METHODS Electronic searches conducted in MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Cochrane CENTRAL revealed 25 original research reports, published 1983-2016, (n=9436). Potential prognostic factors relating to initial pain and physical and psychological functioning were synthesized qualitatively and quantitatively in random effects meta-analyses. The level of evidence (LoE) was evaluated with Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). RESULTS Pain-related factors (intensity and chronicity) were not associated with function/disability at long-term follow-up, odds ratio (OR)=0.84; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.65-1.07 and OR=0.97; 95% CI, 0.93-1.00, respectively (moderate LoE). A better function at follow-up was predicted by Physical factors; higher levels of initial self-reported functioning, OR=1.07; 95% CI, 1.02-1.13 (low LoE), and Psychological factors; low initial levels of emotional distress, OR=0.77; 95% CI, 0.65-0.92, low levels of cognitive and behavioral risk factors, OR=0.85; 95% CI, 0.77-0.93 and high levels of protective cognitive and behavioral factors, OR=1.49; 95% CI, 1.17-1.90 (moderate LoE). DISCUSSION While pain intensity and long-term chronicity did not predict physical functioning in chronic pain patients after MDR, poor pretreatment physical and psychological functioning influenced the prognosis negatively. Thus, treatment should further target and optimize these modifiable factors and an increased focus on positive, psychological protective factors may perhaps provide an opening for yet untapped clinical gains.","Tseli, Elena; Boersma, Katja; Stålnacke, Britt-Marie; Enthoven, Paul; Gerdle, Björn; Äng, Björn O; Grooten, Wilhelmus J A",The Clinical journal of pain,https://doi.org/10.1097/ajp.0000000000000669; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30371517/,336

105586,Family medicine during COVID-19 pandemic,2020-10-04,"BACKGROUND People who use drugs (PWUD) may be at an increased risk of experiencing negative effects related to COVID-19. Border and non-essential service closures may have placed PWUD at an increased risk of experiencing unintended consequences regarding drug consumption and supply patterns, as well as related outcomes. However, the extent of these effects upon this population is unknown. The current study examined how COVID-19 has impacted substance use supply and use characteristics among a national cohort of PWUD in Canada. METHODS We conducted semi-structured one-on-one telephone-based interviews with 200 adult PWUD across Canada who were currently using a licit or illicit psychoactive substance at least weekly, and/or currently receiving opioid agonist treatment (OAT). Thematic analyses were conducted using qualitative software. RESULTS PWUD attributed adverse changes to their substance use frequency, supply, use patterns, and risk behaviors and outcomes to COVID-19. Many participants noted supply disruptions with the majority indicating a decrease in potency and availability, and an increase in the price of substances since COVID-19. Nearly half of participants specified that they had increased their substance use, with some experiencing relapses. In terms of changes to risk level, many participants perceived they were at a greater risk for experiencing an overdose. CONCLUSION This study demonstrated the impacts of COVID-19 on PWUD, including a significant disruption substance supply. For many, these changes led to increased use and substitution for toxic and adulterated substances, which ultimately amplified PWUD's risk for experiencing related harms, including overdoses. These findings warrant the need for improved supports and services, as well as accessibility of safe supply programs, take home naloxone kits, and novel approaches to ensure PWUD have the tools necessary to mitigate risk when using substances.","Ali, Farihah; Russell, Cayley; Nafeh, Frishta; Rehm, Jürgen; LeBlanc, Sean; Elton-Marshall, Tara",The International journal on drug policy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2021.103237; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33893026/,336

A novel, solid-state nanoplasmonic sensor capable of assaying circulating microRNAs through a combined surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) and plasmon-enhanced fluorescence (PEF) approach has been developed. Here, the unique localized surface plasmon resonance properties of chemically-synthesized gold triangular nanoprisms (Au TNPs) are utilized to create large SERS and PEF enhancements. With careful modification to the surface of Au TNPs, this sensing approach is capable of quantifying circulating microRNAs at femtogram/microliter concentrations. Uniquely, the multimodal analytical methods mitigate both false positive and false negative responses and demonstrate the high stability of our sensors within bodily fluids. As a proof of concept, microRNA-10b and microRNA-96 were directly assayed from the plasma of six bladder cancer patients. Results show potential for a highly specific liquid biopsy method that could be used in point-of-care clinical diagnostics to increase early cancer detection or any other diseases including SARS-CoV-2 in which RNAs can be used as biomarkers.","Masterson, Adrianna N; Liyanage, Thakshila; Berman, Claire; Kaimakliotis, Hristos; Johnson, Merrell; Sardar, Rajesh",The Analyst,https://doi.org/10.1039/d0an00538j; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32490854/,336

RESULTS Eighty three studies met the inclusion criteria. Skin lesions have been reported in 0.2 % of the patients. The most frequently reported dermatoses were: maculopapular/ morbilliform rashes, urticaria and angioedema, chilblain-like acral pattern, and vesicular lesions. Among researchers, there are differences of opinion about a possible diagnostic or prognostic value of the skin diseases that are associated to the infection.

INTRODUCTION Survivors of critical care often experience ICU-acquired weakness and poor functional recovery. It is plausible that nutrition interventions throughout their recovery could improve outcomes for these patients. Although a growing number of studies aim to explore the effect of nutrition delivered in the early phases of critical illness, this is also important post-ICU, particularly in already nutritionally compromised patients presenting with muscle loss and fatigue. Therefore, the development of targeted nutrition interventions will be informed by a comprehensive insight into the physiological, physical or psychological difficulties that critically ill patients experience after ICU discharge which may impede oral intake. INCLUSION CRITERIA Primary research studies in adult patients 18 years and older, who are in the recovery phase after being critically ill, and eating orally. Studies must report on any symptoms related to the ability to eat, or represent nutrition inadequacy or utilization. METHODS A scoping review will be conducted in accordance with the JBI methodology using a three-step search strategy of MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, AMED, Web of Science, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and JBI Evidence-based Practice Database to obtain primary research studies that meet the inclusion criteria. Duplicates will be removed, and study selection and data extraction will be conducted and cross-checked by two independent reviewers.

Most patients diagnosed with histoplasmosis in the past usually have exposure to caves and bat guano with travel history to endemic areas. Therefore, travel history and risk activities should be comprehensively assessed when suspecting histoplasmosis because this important information may be overlooked. Although few, possibilities of indigenous cases have also been suggested. Moreover, it is assumed that the number of travelers and endemic mycoses has decreased with the recent coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic. However, clinicians should carefully consider the differential diagnosis of histoplasmosis for travelers traveling to endemic areas. In this case report, we describe an immunocompetent Japanese woman who developed histoplasmosis due to a history of travel to an endemic country. Our case report suggests that clinicians should not exclude histoplasmosis from the differential diagnosis even in the absence of risk features such as activities or immunodeficiencies during travel.","Ide, Satoshi; Kutsuna, Satoshi; Yamada, Gen; Hashimoto, Kohei; Abe, Masahiro; Nagi, Minoru; Ujiie, Mugen; Hayakawa, Kayoko; Ohmagari, Norio",Journal of infection and chemotherapy : official journal of the Japan Society of Chemotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiac.2021.06.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34175216/,336

HAdVs were identified in 31 samples and were characterized by serum neutralization and genome restriction analysis. Eleven HAdVs were identified as being HAdV-7, five of which were classified as being of genome type 7p (Gomen). Six other HAdV-7 isolates gave new restriction profiles with all enzymes used and were classified as being a new genomic variant, 7m. These isolates were further characterized by sequencing. The hexon and fiber genes of the 7m variant were nearly identical to the prototype, 7p.

The purpose of this study was to investigate if iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms can be used to improve the diagnostic value of standard-dose CTP in AIS. METHODS Twenty-three patients with AIS underwent CTP with standardized protocol and dose. Raw data were reconstructed with filtered back projection (FBP) and IR with intensity levels 3, 4, 5. Image quality was objectively (quantitative perfusion values, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR)) and subjectively (overall image quality) assessed. Ischemic core and perfusion mismatch were visually rated. Discriminative power for tissue outcome prediction was determined by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) resulting from the overlap between follow-up infarct lesions and stepwise thresholded CTP maps. RESULTS With increasing levels of IR, objective image quality (SNR and CNR in white matter and gray matter, elimination of error voxels) and subjective image quality improved. Using IR, mean transit time (MTT) was higher in ischemic lesions, while there was no significant change of cerebral blood volume (CBV) and cerebral blood flow (CBF). Visual assessments of perfusion mismatch changed in 4 patients, while the ischemic core remained constant in all cases. Discriminative power for infarct prediction as represented by AUC was not significantly changed in CBV, but increased in CBF and MTT (mean (95% CI)): 0.72 (0.67-0.76) vs. 0.74 (0.70-0.78) and 0.65 (0.62-0.67) vs 0.67 (0.64-0.70). CONCLUSION In acute stroke patients, IR improves objective and subjective image quality when applied to standard-dose CTP. This adds to the overall confidence of CTP in acute stroke triage.","Flottmann, Fabian; Kabath, Jan; Illies, Till; Schneider, Tanja; Buhk, Jan-Hendrik; Fiehler, Jens; Kemmling, André",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0150103; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26930290/,336

The relationship between exclusive breastfeeding and lower risk of childhood obesity has elicited much scientific interest, given the fact that this form of malnutrition is becoming a global epidemic. AIM This narrative review aims to examine the evidence in the literature linking exclusive breastfeeding with reduction in obesity in children. LITERATURE SEARCH Using appropriate search terms, PubMed database was searched for relevant articles that met the review objective. RESULTS Evidence for the protective effect of exclusive breastfeeding against childhood obesity have been provided by studies which explored 5 physiologic mechanisms and those that established the causality between breastfeeding and lower risk of obesity. The few studies that disputed this relationship highlighted the influence of confounding factors. A new insight on molecular mechanisms, however, points to a direct and indirect effect of human milk oligosaccharides on the prevention of overweight and obesity. CONCLUSIONS The preponderance of current evidence strongly suggests that exclusivity in breastfeeding can prevent the development of obesity in children.","Uwaezuoke, Samuel N; Eneh, Chizoma I; Ndu, Ikenna K",Clinical medicine insights.

Such patients are usually treated with immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive agents, which may tamper with the organism's normal response to infections. Currently, no consensus has been reached on how to manage MS and NMOSD patients during the pandemic. OBJECTIVE To discuss strategies to manage those patients. METHODS We focus on how to 1) reduce COVID-19 infection risk, such as social distancing, telemedicine, and wider interval between laboratory testing/imaging; 2) manage relapses, such as avoiding treatment of mild relapse and using oral steroids; 3) manage disease-modifying therapies, such as preference for drugs associated with lower infection risk (interferons, glatiramer, teriflunomide, and natalizumab) and extended-interval dosing of natalizumab, when safe; 4) individualize the chosen MS induction-therapy (anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, alemtuzumab, and cladribine); 5) manage NMOSD preventive therapies, including initial therapy selection and current treatment maintenance; 6) manage MS/NMOSD patients infected with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS In the future, real-world case series of MS/NMOSD patients infected with COVID-19 will help us define the best management strategies.

114888,Psychosis and COVID-19: is it time to pre-emptively revise advanced directives?,2021-05-20,"Helicobacter pylori is a potent human gastric pathogen. It is known to be associated with several gastroenteric disorders, including gastritis, peptic ulcer, and gastric cancer. The H. pylori genome encodes a gene product TlyA that has been shown to display potent membrane damaging properties and cytotoxic activity. On the basis of such properties, TlyA is considered as a potential virulence factor of H. pylori. In this study, we show that the H. pylori TlyA protein has a strong propensity to convert into the amyloid-like aggregated assemblies, upon exposure to elevated temperatures. Even at the physiological temperature of 37 °C, TlyA shows a strong amyloidogenic property. TlyA aggregates that are generated upon exposure at temperatures of ≥37 °C show prominent binding to dyes like thioflavin T and Nile Red. Transmission electron microscopy also demonstrates the presence of typical amyloid-like fibrils in the TlyA aggregates generated at 37 °C. Conversion of TlyA into the amyloid-like aggregates is found to be associated with major alterations in the secondary and tertiary structural organization of the protein. Finally, our study shows that the preformed amyloid-like aggregates of TlyA are capable of exhibiting potent cytotoxic activities against human gastric adenocarcinoma cells. Altogether, such a propensity of H. pylori TlyA to convert into the amyloid-like aggregated assemblies with cytotoxic activity suggests potential implications for the virulence functionality of the protein.","Lata, Kusum; Chattopadhyay, Kausik",Biochemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.5b00423; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26015064/,336

The conventional measurement of vitamin D levels provides a general indicator of body stores. However, there are nuances in its interpretation as values of 25(OH)D do not correlate absolutely with the amount of 'bioavailable' vitamin to the cells. Vitamin D should be regarded as a hormone and influences between 5% and 10% of our total genome. Determining the precise effect of the vitamin, isolated from the actions of other cofactors, is not straightforward and restricts our complete understanding of all of its actions. Deficiency has harmful effects on not only bone and muscle but also wider areas, including immunity and respiratory and neurological activities. More caution should be applied regarding the ability of supranormal vitamin D levels to elevate athletic performance. Hopefully, future research will shed more light on optimal levels of vitamin D and supplementation regimes, and improved understanding of its intracellular control of our genetic mechanisms and how extrinsic influences modify its activity.","Ribbans, William J; Aujla, Randeep; Dalton, Seamus; Nunley, James A",Journal of ISAKOS : joint disorders & orthopaedic sports medicine,https://doi.org/10.1136/jisakos-2020-000435; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33833045/,336

115697,"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the provision of routine childhood immunizations in Ontario, Canada.",2021-06-01,"Background and aims Previous studies suggest that attentional bias and disengagement may vary as a function of Body Mass Index (BMI), most notably in a palatable food related context. Though this could indeed represent a food context specific effect, it could also represent a general reward related context effect. In addition, though mindfulness and stress have both been reported to affect attention, it is not yet clear whether these moderate the relationship between BMI and attention as a function of reward context. In the current study we addressed these questions. It was hypothesized that BMI would be positively associated with bias in a food context and money context relative to a neutral context. The inverse was expected for disengagement. It was expected that mindfulness would decrease these relationships and for stress the inverse was expected. Methods In the current online study, eighty-seven participants (24 males and 63 females; age: M = 30.1, SD = 8.3; BMI: M = 24.2, SD = 4.67), filled out questionnaires and completed a visuospatial cueing task measuring attention and disengagement of attention in a neutral, food-related, and money-related condition. Results There was no association between BMI and attentional bias. Higher BMI was associated with faster responses to money pictures presented opposite to a cued location as compared to money pictures that did not follow a predictive cue. Our results do not support a clear moderating role of mindfulness and stress. Discussion and conclusion Our results imply faster processing and associated quicker responding to unanticipated reward-related stimuli in individuals with overweight or obesity.","Tsegaye, Afework; Bjørne, Joachim; Winther, Anita; Kökönyei, Gyöngyi; Cserjési, Renáta; Logemann, H N Alexander",Journal of behavioral addictions,https://doi.org/10.1556/2006.2020.00073; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33006956/,336

The precise pathophysiology behind this gender difference in mortality outcomes remains unclear at this stage, although it is worth exploring a possible role of testosterone as one of the contributory factors. The observed role of androgens in transcription of transmembrane protease serine-2, which facilitates COVID-19 anchoring to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 cell surface receptors, seems to suggest that higher testosterone levels might be detrimental for outcomes. On the other hand, men with type 2 diabetes mellitus and central obesity have an increased prevalence of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, with inhibition of gonadotropin-releasing hormone secretion induced by inflammatory cytokines being one of the postulated mechanisms. The increased COVID-19 case fatality in this cohort might perhaps reflect an underlying pro-inflammatory state, with low testosterone levels being either a surrogate marker of a poor metabolic state or playing a more active role in propagation of inflammation and thrombosis.","Kalra, Sanjay; Bhattacharya, Saptarshi; Kalhan, Atul",European endocrinology,https://doi.org/10.17925/ee.2020.16.2.88; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33117437/,336

Persons with dementia bring unique healthcare challenges due to the manifestation of behavioral and psychological symptoms associated with the disease. The lack of geriatric clinicians as well as a properly trained non-geriatric specialist workforce capable of addressing the symptoms persons with dementia exacerbate the challenge of providing effective care. Pharmacological interventions are contraindicated for treatment of most behavioral psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services now requires that nonpharmacological interventions be used as a first-line treatment. It has not been determined what nonpharmacological intervention for BPSD are most effective and what the infrastructure would entail for such interventions for PWD living at home. Purpose of Review The purpose of this study is to examine the literature focusing on interventions aimed towards managing persons' symptoms of dementia living in home-based settings. A scoping review examining the literature published on this topic over the last three years was conducted.

METHODS All operations were performed by the same surgeon. Parameters assessed included patient history, indication for surgery, operation time, complication rate, conversion rate, robot-related issues, length of hospital stay, postoperative pain, and time to return to work. All patients were followed for a 2-month period postoperatively. RESULTS Forty-five patients (22 women, 23 men) underwent single-incision robotic cholecystectomy from March 1 to July 15, 2011. There were no conversions to either conventional laparoscopy or laparotomy, although in three cases a second trocar was used. There were no major complications apart from a single case of postoperative hemorrhage. Average patient age was 47 ± 12 years (range = 27-80 years) and average BMI was 30 kg/m(2) (mean = 28.8 ± 4 kg/m(2), range = 18.4-46.7 kg/m(2)). The primary indication for surgery was gallstones. The mean operation time (skin-to-skin) was 84.5 ± 25.5 min (range = 51-175 min), docking time was 5.8 ± 1.5 min (range = 4-11 min), and console time (net surgical time) was 43 ± 21.9 min (range = 21-121 min). Intraoperative blood loss was negligible. There were no collisions between the robotic arms and no other robot-related problems. Average postoperative length of stay was less than 24 h. The mean Visual Analog Pain Scale Score 6 h after the operation was 2.2 ± 1.51 (range = 0-6) and patients returned to normal activities in 4.48 ± 2.3 days (range = 1-9 days). CONCLUSIONS Single-Site(®) is a new platform offering a potentially more stable and reliable environment to perform single-port cholecystectomy. Both simple and complicated cholecystectomies can be performed with safety. The technique is possible in patients with a high BMI.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of ultra-low-dose (ULD) chest CT for detecting viral pneumonia patterns compared to standard (STD) dose chest CT. Methods All consecutive adult patients with two non-enhanced chest CT acquisitions, one STD and one ULD, for suspicion of viral pneumonia between March 5th and April 2nd 2020 were included. CT results were divided into two groups: non-viral pneumonia CT or compatible with viral pneumonia CT based on viral pneumonia CT patterns: ground-glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, crazy paving, air bronchogram signs and fibrous stripes. The diagnostic performance of ULD CT for suspicion of viral pneumonia was evaluated. For CTs compatible with viral pneumonia, CT pattern detection on ULD CT was assessed and STD CT was used as a reference. Results The study included 380 patients with 97 CTs (25.5%) compatible with viral pneumonia. The mean effective doses (EDs) were 1.66 (1.29; 2.18) mSv for STD and 0.20 (0.18; 0.22) mSv for ULD CT (P<0.001). The sensitivity and specificity of ULD CT for viral pneumonia detection were 98.9% and 99.0%, respectively. GGO, consolidation and fibrous stripes were equally visible in STD and ULD in 100% (n=97), 36% (n=35) and 23% (n=22) of compatible viral pneumonia-CT patients, respectively. Air bronchogram sign detection was equivalent, concerning 23% (n=22) of patients in STD and 22% (n=21) in ULD. Crazy paving was visible in 24% (n=23) of patients in STD and only 8% (n=8) in ULD (P=0.003). Conclusions In comparison to STD dose chest CT, ULD chest CT, with a mean reduction dose of 88.0%, has comparable diagnostic performance for detecting viral pneumonia on CT.","Greffier, Joël; Hoballah, Adel; Sadate, Alexandre; de Oliveira, Fabien; Claret, Pierre-Geraud; de Forges, Hélène; Loubet, Paul; Mauboussin, Jean-Marc; Hamard, Aymeric; Beregi, Jean-Paul; Frandon, Julien",Quantitative imaging in medicine and surgery,https://doi.org/10.21037/qims-20-1176; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34249645/,336

Several plant extracts act as antioxidant agents against wide-range of pesticide toxicity hazards through the free radicals scavenging properties. Plants' secondary metabolites are considered as efficient protective agents against various cellular toxic injuries. Understanding these properties of botanicals, several researchers currently focused on the detoxification and ameliorative potency of plant extracts against highly toxic chemicals. In our studies, we focused on the endosulfan total and its isomers (alpha and beta) induced changes on Drosophila melanogaster and their ameliorative effects by co-administrated with methanolic and aqueous extracts of Catharanthus roseus whole plant. We selected the 1/5th EC50 concentration of alpha-endosulfan, beta-endosulfan, and endosulfan (total) and co-administrated with 1/50th EC50 concentration of aqueous and methanolic extracts and evaluated their ameliorative effects, in terms of verifying the life stage activities, protein profiling and also by using live brain cells imaging.

It is difficult to foresee the future length and severity; it may be weeks, months, or even years that could deplete the energy and resources of the health care facilities and the providers as there is marginal to no pharmacological medication available to treat the Covid-19. Unless an effective pharmacological treatment such as medicines and vaccines is developed and released publicly, wearing protective face masks and protecting personal health and hygiene is merely a choice to avoid the Covid-19 spread. This review summarizes the background knowledge on the Covid-19 disease and currently available face masks for highly infectious disease primary prevention. According to recent studies onf Covid-19 prevention, diagnosis, and treatment, nanotechnologists have provided a revolutionary approach that involves both pharmacological and non-pharmacological steps, one of which is the use of nanofibers in facemasks and respirators. METHOD Various research carried out in the field of nano masks and patented reports based on the application of nano masks were reviewed.

120440,"Compassion fatigue, burnout, compassion satisfaction, and perceived stress in healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 health crisis in Spain.",2020-08-28,"Receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) induces generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), which act as second messengers in RANKL-mediated osteoclastogenesis. Dual oxidase maturation factor 1 (Duoxa1) has been associated with the maturation of ROS-generating enzymes including dual oxidases (Duox1 and Duox2). In the progression of osteoclast differentiation, we identified that only Duoxa1 showed an effective change upon RANKL stimulation, but not Duox1, Duox2, and Duoxa2. Therefore, we hypothesized that Duoxa1 could independently act as a second messenger for RANKL stimulation and regulate ROS production during osteoclastogenesis. Duoxa1 gradually increased during RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis. Using siRNA or retrovirus transduction, we found that Duoxa1 regulated RANKL-stimulated osteoclast formation and bone resorption positively. Furthermore, knockdown of Duoxa1 decreased the RANKL-induced ROS production. During Duoxa1-related control of osteoclastogenesis, activation of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6)-mediated early signaling molecules including MAPKs, Akt, IκB, Btk, Src and PLCγ2 was affected, which sequentially modified the mRNA or protein expression levels of key transcription factors in osteoclast differentiation, such as c-Fos and NFATc1, as well as mRNA expression of osteoclast-specific markers. Overall, our data indicate that Duoxa1 plays a crucial role in osteoclastogenesis via regulating RANKL-induced intracellular ROS production and activating TRAF6-mediated signaling.","Cheon, Yoon-Hee; Lee, Chang Hoon; Jeong, Da Hye; Kwak, Sung Chul; Kim, Soojin; Lee, Myeung Su; Kim, Ju-Young",International journal of molecular sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21176416; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32899248/,336

We reviewed recent epidemiological evidence regarding intrauterine exposure to acetaminophen and risk for asthma, neurodevelopment disorders, and reproductive health in childhood. RECENT FINDINGS An increasing number of cohort studies have suggested that maternal use of acetaminophen during pregnancy was associated with increased risk for asthma; neurodevelopmental disorders, especially ADHD and behavioral problems; and genital malformations in the offspring. Oxidative stress and inflammation or endocrine effects are plausible shared biological mechanisms for the exposure to influence multiple developmental outcomes. We discussed methodological challenges that can threaten the validity of these observational data, including confounding and measurement errors. Novel statistical methods and research designs that can be used to mitigate these issues were introduced. Given the high prevalence of use, findings regarding intrauterine exposure to acetaminophen on multiple child health outcomes raise concerns. Research on causal and non-causal mechanisms that might explain these associations should be a priority.","Liew, Zeyan; Ernst, Andreas",Current environmental health reports,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40572-020-00301-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33398668/,336

OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to compare the accuracy and determine cutoffs for 3 short cognitive screening instruments: the Mini-Mental State Examination, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Quick Mild Cognitive Impairment Screen-Turkish version (Qmci-TR), in older adults with low literacy in Turkey. METHODS In all 321 patients, 133 with subjective cognitive complaints (SCC), 88 amnestic-type mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and 100 with probable Alzheimer disease (AD) with a median of 5 years education were included. Education and age-specific cutoffs were determined. RESULTS For the overall population, the Qmci-TR was more accurate than the MoCA in distinguishing between aMCI and AD (area under the curve=0.83 vs. 0.76, P=0.004) and the Qmci-TR and Mini-Mental State Examination were superior to the MoCA in discriminating SCC from aMCI and AD. All instruments had similar accuracy among those with low literacy (primary school and lower educational level or illiterate). CONCLUSIONS To distinguish between SCC, aMCI, and AD in a sample of older Turkish adults, the Qmci-TR may be preferable.

METHODS A multicenter, nonrandomized, retrospective study was conducted of TAAA patients grouped by urgent/emergent and elective treatment with multibranched endograft for endovascular aneurysm repair at 13 Italian centers from November 2012 to August 2016. Urgent/emergent repair was classified as rupture in 16%, impending rupture in 9%, pain in 53%, or a maximum TAAA diameter ≥80 mm in 22%. Study end points were technical success, mortality, spinal cord ischemia, target visceral vessel (TVV) patency, and procedure-related reinterventions at 30 days and at follow-up. RESULTS Seventy-three patients (274 TVVs) were enrolled. Treatment was performed in elective (n = 41 [56%]) or urgent/emergent (n = 32 [44%]) settings, according to a single-step (n = 30 [41%]) or staged (n = 43 [59%]) approach. Technical success was 92%. Mortality within 30 days was 4% (n = 3 urgent/emergent patients) due to myocardial infarction. Spinal cord ischemia was recorded in two patients (3%; elective group). The primary patency of TVVs was 99% (three renal branch occlusions). Procedure-related reinterventions were required in five cases (7%). At least one adverse event from any cause ≤30 days was registered in 42% (n = 31). At a median follow-up of 18 months (range, 1-43 months), eight (11%) deaths (elective vs urgent/emergent, 2% vs 22%; P = .018), three (1%) cases of branch occlusion or stenosis, and five (7%) reinterventions were recorded. A survival of 88% (standard error [SE], 4%), 86% (SE, 4%), and 82% (SE, 5%) was evidenced at 12, 24, and 36 months, respectively. Urgent/emergent repair and female gender were identified as independent risk factors for all-cause mortality (P < .001 and P = .015, respectively), and the staged approach was identified as protective (P = .026). Freedom from reintervention was 86% (SE, 4%) and 83% (SE, 5%) at 12 and 24 months. CONCLUSIONS The first off-the-shelf multibranched endograft seems safe in both urgent/emergent and elective settings. The staged surgical approach appears to positively influence overall survival. This unique device and its operators will usher in a new treatment paradigm for TAAA repair.","Silingardi, Roberto; Gennai, Stefano; Leone, Nicola; Gargiulo, Mauro; Faggioli, Gianluca; Cao, Piergiorgio; Verzini, Fabio; Ippoliti, Arnaldo; Tusini, Nicola; Ricci, Carmelo; Antonello, Michele; Chiesa, Roberto; Marone, Enrico Maria; Mangialardi, Nicola; Speziale, Francesco; Veraldi, Gian Franco; Bonardelli, Stefano; Marcheselli, Luigi",Journal of vascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvs.2017.08.068; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29097044/,336

METHODS This was a multicentre, retrospective, observational cohort study which involved all vascular surgery services in Lombardy, Northern Italy. Data were retrospectively merged into a combined dataset covering the nine weeks of the Italian COVID-19 pandemic phase 1 (8 March 2020 to 3 May 2020). The primary outcome was freedom from in hospital death, secondary outcomes were re-thrombosis rate after peripheral revascularisation, and freedom from post-operative complication. RESULTS Among 674 patients managed during the outbreak, 659 (97.8%) were included in the final analysis: 121 (18.4%) were CV19-pos. CV19-pos status was associated with a higher rate of complications (OR 4.5; p < .001, 95% CI 2.64 - 7.84), and a higher rate of re-thrombosis after peripheral arterial revascularisation (OR 2.2; p = .004, 95% CI 1.29 - 3.88). In hospital mortality was higher in CV19-pos patients (24.8% vs. 5.6%; OR 5.4, p < .001;95% CI 2.86 - 8.92). Binary logistic regression analysis identified CV19-pos status (OR 7.6; p < .001, 95% CI 3.75 - 15.28) and age > 80 years (OR 3.2; p = .001, 95% CI 1.61 - 6.57) to be predictors of in hospital death.

The models used in the discovery of cancer treatment are continuously changing and extending toward advanced preclinical studies. Cancer models are either naturally existing or artificially prepared experimental systems that show similar features with human tumors though the heterogeneous nature of the tumor is very familiar. The choice of the most fitting model to best reflect the given tumor system is one of the real difficulties for cancer examination. Therefore, vast studies have been conducted on the cancer models for developing a better understanding of cancer invasion, progression, and early detection. These models give an insight into cancer etiology, molecular basis, host tumor interaction, the role of microenvironment, and tumor heterogeneity in tumor metastasis. These models are also used to predict novel cancer markers, targeted therapies, and are extremely helpful in drug development. In this review, the potential of cancer models to be used as a platform for drug screening and therapeutic discoveries are highlighted. Although none of the cancer models is regarded as ideal because each is associated with essential caveats that restraint its application yet by bridging the gap between preliminary cancer research and translational medicine. However, they promise a brighter future for cancer treatment.","Sajjad, Humna; Imtiaz, Saiqa; Noor, Tayyaba; Siddiqui, Yusra Hasan; Sajjad, Anila; Zia, Muhammad",Animal models and experimental medicine,https://doi.org/10.1002/ame2.12165; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34179717/,336

RESULTS The cumulative LTP rates were 4.6 and 4.6% at 3 and 5 years, respectively, in the NIN HCC group, and 15.9 and 20.5% in the non-NIN HCC group, with borderline statistical significance (p = 0.085). The corresponding DFS rates were 53.8 and 37.7% in the NIN HCC group and 44.0 and 31.7% in the non-NIN HCC group, with no significant difference (p = 0.318). Although on multivariate analysis only tumor size was a significant prognostic factor for LTP, there was a trend bordering on the significance for the NIN feature [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.19; p = 0.099]. However, it was not a significant factor for DFS (HR = 0.18; p = 0.682). CONCLUSIONS The NIN appearance, a rare (4%, 22/550) but unique feature of early HCC, may be a favorable prognostic factor for RFA in terms of local tumor control.","Kang, Tae Wook; Rhim, Hyunchul; Song, Kyoung Doo; Lee, Min Woo; Cha, Dong Ik; Ha, Sang Yun; Ahn, Joong Hyun",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00270-016-1525-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27933377/,336
124142,"""Run distancing"" in the era of COVID-19 pandemic.",2020-05-01,"BACKGROUND The coronavirus pandemic resulted in national lockdowns that are associated with a rise in important macro-stressors for populations worldwide. The aim of the present study was to assess the impact of the COVID-19-related lockdown period on the sociocultural attitudes towards appearance, body image, eating attitudes and behaviours, physical activity, and quality of life of Lithuanian university-aged students of both genders. METHOD A total of 1850 students completed the body image, health-related behaviour and quality of life assessments three months before the first lockdown, of which 959 provided consent and an e-mail to be contacted by for further surveys. Of these 959, 230 completed the same questionnaire during the second lockdown providing the informed consent for the participation in the COVID-19-impact for the lifestyle study and use their first round data for the comparison with the lockdown. The age of the participants was 23.9 ± 5.4 years. Independent comparisons were used to test lifestyle and body image differences between men and women before and during the lockdown. Paired-sample statistics were conducted to evaluate any changes in the male and female groups separately with Cohen's d employed to represent effect sizes. RESULTS No body image or disordered eating changes were found, however, body appearance evaluation increased in women (effect size 0.15). Significant increases in media pressures (in women, effect size 0.16) and the internalization of thin/low body fat beauty ideals (effect size 1.18-1.46) were observed during the lockdown when compared to baseline. No changes in quality of life were evident for men, however, for women, an increase in general and psychological domain was observed (effect size 0.17). We observed a significant decrease in physical activity (in men, effect size 0.46), an increase in internet browsing time (effect size 0.52-0.8), a decrease in unhealthy eating habits (effect size 0.49-0.60), an increase in sleep duration (in women, effect size 0.40) and lower self-rated health (in men, effect size 0.42) during the lockdown when compared to baseline. CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest that the majority of students cope with lockdown-related situation well. However, based on the Tripartite influence model, we can speculate that a drastic increase in the internalization of stereotyped thin/low body fat ideals might trigger body image concerns and increase disordered eating after the lockdown. Specific interventions helping students to decrease internalization of stereotyped body ideals, to promote positive body image and physical activity may be beneficial during and after the COVID-19-related lockdown.","Baceviciene, Migle; Jankauskiene, Rasa",Appetite,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2021.105452; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34107292/,336

Studies 1A/B demonstrated that the interaction between moral basis and message sidedness was present not just for a controversial issue with balanced views in society but also for a topic with a majority opinion. In Study 2, the relative effectiveness of two- over one-sided messages for people with a moral attitude basis was shown to occur only when the two-sided message respectfully acknowledged the recipient's side. In Study 3, the effect was replicated in a preregistered experiment. Furthermore, moral bases provided unique predictive power beyond alternative attitude strength indicators. Across all studies, perceived appreciation of the speaker acknowledging the recipient's view mediated the impact of the independent variables on openness.","Xu, Mengran; Petty, Richard E",Personality & social psychology bulletin,https://doi.org/10.1177/0146167220988371; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33588648/,336

Staphylococcus (S.) aureus (62.8%, 54/86), human rhino- and coronaviruses (HRV, 29.1%, 25/86; HCoV, 16.3%, 14/86) were frequently detected in humans while Haemophilus parasuis (90.0%, 45/50), Mycoplasma hyorhinis (78.6%, 11/14), Enterovirus G (EV-G, 56.0%, 28/50), and S. aureus (36.0%, 18/50), respectively, were highly prevalent in pigs. The detection of S. aureus in human follow-up samples indicates a carrier status. The methicillin-resistant phenotype (MRSA) was identified in 33.3% (18/54) of nasal swabs and in one of 18 (5.6%) of pooled snout swabs tested positive for S. aureus. Strains were indicative of the livestock-associated clonal complex CC398, with t011 being the most common staphylococcal protein a type. Enterobacterales and non-fermenters were frequently isolated from swabs. Their detection in follow-up samples suggests a carrier status. All were classified as being non-multiresistant. There was no example for cross-species transmission of viruses. In contrast, transmission of S. aureus through occupational contact to pigs seems possible. The study contributes to the ""One Health"" approach.","Bunke, Jennifer; Receveur, Kerstin; Christin Oeser, Ann; Gutsmann, Imke; Schubert, Sabine; Podschun, Rainer; Zell, Roland; Fickenscher, Helmut; Krumbholz, Andi","APMIS : acta pathologica, microbiologica, et immunologica Scandinavica",https://doi.org/10.1111/apm.13046; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32358920/,336
124858,Policy and Health: Leveraging a Social Determinants of Health Framework to Alleviate the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Patients With Cancer.,2020-12-03,"Real-time monitoring of exhaled carbon dioxide (CO2), also known as capnography, is a valuable hospital tool for assessing patient health during anesthesia and in both the emergency department and critical care units. The fundamental measurement is referred to as end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) concentration that reflects pulmonary gas exchange of CO2 representing systemic metabolism. The shape of the exhaled CO2 concentration for individual inhalation/exhalation breath cycles can offer additional information regarding lung function, airway obstruction, alveolar ventilation, and worsening disease. The most frequent use is to indicate appropriate placement of an endotracheal tube but and it is also employed in the assessment of disease severity and response to treatment (e.g. asthma). Other applications include outpatient monitoring with oxygen supplementation (nasal cannula) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) control for sleep apnea. As technology has evolved, CO2 measurements have become more mobile; capnography systems are now used by emergency medical services (EMS) personnel for verifying proper placement of airway devices in ""pre-hospital"" environments. The use of CO2 diagnostics has evolved to identify breathing system disruptions in ""on-demand"" regulator/masks equipment, both in medical and occupational settings. Most recently, miniaturized TLS sensors have been implemented for assessing pilot breathing in high-performance military aircraft. This editorial describes the use of CO2 breath sensors and proposes some new applications based on miniaturized sensors that can be directly inserted into breathing masks.","Pleil, Joachim D; Christensen, Lance",Journal of breath research,https://doi.org/10.1088/1752-7163/ac2723; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34525465/,336

Gastrointestinal lumens are potential spaces that accommodate ingested substances and are lined by polarized epithelium that is smooth and shiny (with the exception of the rumen) when healthy and intact. Because xenobiotics most frequently enter the body via ingestion, the gastrointestinal system and its ancillary glands are the first line of defense against foreign materials and pathogens of all types. The anatomic, biochemical, physical, secretory, and endocrinologic properties of the epithelium, resident, and blood-borne effector cells, microbiota, genetic polymorphisms, and gut-associated lymphoid tissue (which comprises one-quarter of the body's total) must be physically or functionally altered for diarrhea to occur.

126111,2020 STD Prevention Conference: Disrupting Epidemics and Dismantling Disparities in the Time of COVID-19.,2021-05-06,"BACKGROUND Single-incision thoracoscopic surgery (SITS) requires extensive time and practice to achieve satisfactory technical skills. The aim of this study was to evaluate the learning curves of SITS for primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP). METHODS This study included a total of 274 consecutive patients who underwent PSP surgery by a single operator between May 2011 and February 2014. During this period, SITS was applied as a routine approach. Learning curves were made by the cumulative sum (CUSUM) method using the number of cases and four surgical technique-related factors, including operation time, postoperative complication, non-SITS rate, and ipsilateral PSP recurrence. RESULTS Among the 274 patients, 16 patients who were presented with a previous 3-port wound scar or inadequate chest tube site before surgery were not eligible for SITS. Hence, SITS was attempted on 258 patients and performed successfully in 251 patients. For these successful SITS patients, the mean age was 22.9 ± 8.1 years, the mean operation time was 65.6 ± 22.2 min, the mean chest tube indwelling time was 1.5 ± 1.1 days, and the mean postoperative hospital stay was 1.7 ± 1.1 days. The mean operation time decreased from 84.0 to 47.6 min when a comparison was made between patients operated in the initial 6 months and the last 6 months of the study period. As revealed by the CUSUM technique, more than 50 % of the cases experienced an operation time of <70 min after the first 92 cases. After 57 cases, the postoperative complication rate was maintained at <5 %. The non-SITS rate was achieved to be lower than 5 % after 112 cases. The ipsilateral PSP recurrence rate was maintained at below 8 % after 102 cases. CONCLUSIONS Although PSP is the most applicable scenario for the beginner of SITS, at least 100 cases of experience are needed to achieve optimal technical level.","Yang, Hee Chul; Kim, Sohee; Yum, Sungwon; Cho, Sukki; Kim, Kwhanmien; Jheon, Sanghoon",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-016-5158-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27515837/,336

126778,Returning to physical activity after covid-19.,2021-01-08,"The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) now is considered a global public health emergency. One of the unprecedented challenges is defining optimal therapy for those patients with severe pneumonia and systemic manifestations of COVID-19. Optimal therapy should be largely based on the pathogenesis of infections caused by this novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Since the onset of COVID-19, there have been many prepublications and publications reviewing the therapy of COVID-19 as well as many prepublications and publications reviewing the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. However, there have been no comprehensive reviews that link COVID-19 therapies to the pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2. In order to link COVID-19 therapies to pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2, we performed a comprehensive search through MEDLINE, PubMed, medRxiv, EMBASE, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of Science using the following keywords: COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, novel 2019 coronavirus, pathology, pathologic, pathogenesis, pathophysiology, coronavirus pneumonia, coronavirus infection, coronavirus pulmonary infection, coronavirus cardiovascular infection, coronavirus gastroenteritis, coronavirus autopsy findings, viral sepsis, endotheliitis, thrombosis, coagulation abnormalities, immunology, humeral immunity, cellular immunity, inflammation, cytokine storm, superantigen, therapy, treatment, therapeutics, immune-based therapeutics, antiviral agents, respiratory therapy, oxygen therapy, anticoagulation therapy, adjuvant therapy, and preventative therapy. Opinions expressed in this review also are based on personal experience as clinicians, authors, peer reviewers, and editors. This narrative review linking COVID-19 therapies with pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in 6 major therapeutic goals for COVID-19 therapy based on pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2. These goals are listed below: 1. The first goal is identifying COVID-19 patients that require both testing and therapy. This is best accomplished with a COVID-19 molecular test from symptomatic patients as well as determining the oxygen saturation in such patients with a pulse oximeter. It can be argued that whether a symptomatic respiratory illness is COVID-19, influenza or another respiratory pathogen, an oxygen saturation less that 90% means that the patient requires medical assistance. 2. The second goal is to correct the hypoxia. This goal generally requires hospitalization for oxygen therapy; other respiratory-directed therapies such as prone positioning or mechanical ventilation are often used in the attempt to correct hypoxemia due to COVID-19. 3. The third goal is reducing the viral load of SARS-CoV-2. Ideally, there would be an oral antiviral agent available such as seen with the use of oseltamivir phosphate for influenza. This oral antiviral agent should be taken early in the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Such an oral agent is not available yet. Currently, two options are available for reducing the viral load of SARS-CoV-2. These are post-Covid-19 plasma with a high neutralizing antibody titer against SARS-CoV-2 or intravenous remdesivir; both options require hospitalization. 4. The fourth goal is to identify and address the hyperinflammation phase often seen in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Currently, fever with an elevated C-reactive protein is useful for diagnosing this hyperinflammation syndrome. Low-dose dexamethasone therapy currently is the best therapeutic approach. 5. The fifth goal is to identify and address the hypercoagulability phase seen in many hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Patient who would benefit from anticoagulation therapy can be identified by a marked increase in D-dimer and prothrombin time with a decrease in fibrinogen. To correct this disseminated intravascular coagulation-like phase, anticoagulation therapy with low molecular weight heparin is preferred. Anticoagulation therapy with unfractionated heparin is preferred in COVID-19 patients with acute kidney injuries. 6. The last goal is prophylaxis for persons who are not yet infected. Potential supplements include vitamin D and zinc. Although the data for such supplements is not extremely strong, it can be argued that almost 50% of the population world-wide has a vitamin D deficiency. Correcting this deficiency would be beneficial regardless of any impact of COVID-19. Similarly, zinc is an important supplement that is important in one's diet regardless of any effect on SARS-CoV-2. As emerging therapies are found to be more effective against the SARS-CoV-2 pathogenic mechanisms identified, they can be substituted for those therapies presented in this review.

AIM To provide recommendations and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) based on best evidence for diagnosis and treatment of PD. METHODS Medical literature was reviewed and combined with expert opinion of the authors. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Recommendations and SOPs based on grading of evidence-based medical literature. RESULTS PD is a fibrotic wound-healing disorder involving the tunica albuginea of the corpora cavernosa. The resulting scar is responsible for a variety of deformities, including curvature, shortening, narrowing with hinge effect, and is frequently associated in the early phase with pain. Patients frequently experience diminished quality erections. All of these conditions can compromise sexual function for the affected male. The etiopathophysiology of PD has yet to be clarified and as a result, effective, reliable, mechanistic directed non-surgical therapy is lacking. CONCLUSIONS The management of PD consists of proper diagnosis and treatment, ranging from non-surgical to surgical interventions. The main state of treatment for PD rests at this time on surgical correction that should be based on clear indications, involve surgical consent, and follow a surgical algorithm that includes tunica plication, plaque incision/partial excision and grafting, and penile prosthesis implantation.","Levine, Laurence A; Burnett, Arthur L",The journal of sexual medicine,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1743-6109.2012.03003.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23211057/,336

OBJECTIVE To create and implement a 3-hour curriculum to prepare several hundred non-critical care staff nurses to manage critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019. METHODS Critical care nursing leaders and staff developed and implemented a flexible critical care nursing curriculum tailored to the diverse experience, expertise, and learning needs of non-critical care nursing staff who were being redeployed to critical care units during the surge response to the pandemic. Curricular elements included respiratory failure and ventilator management, shock and hemodynamics, pharmacotherapy for critical illnesses, and renal replacement therapy. A skills station allowed hands-on practice with common critical care equipment. RESULTS A total of 413 nurses completed training within 10 days. As of June 2020, 151 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 still required mechanical ventilation at our institution, and 7 of 10 temporary intensive care units remained operational. Thus most of the nurses who received this training continued to practice critical care. A unique feature of this curriculum was the tailored instruction, adapted to learners' needs, which improved the efficiency of content delivery. CONCLUSIONS Program evaluation is ongoing.

Evidence suggests that dysmenorrhea may also be a risk factor for other chronic pain conditions. Limited research has examined women's experience with dysmenorrhea using qualitative data. Research is warranted to address issues and needs that are important from women's own perspectives. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to describe women's salient thoughts about their experiences of dysmenorrhea. METHODS We analyzed data collected from an open-ended question within a cross-sectional survey study conducted in the United States. Using qualitative thematic analysis, free text responses to a question asking women to share their experience with dysmenorrhea were analyzed. RESULTS The sample consisted of 225 women who provided valid responses to the open-ended question. Six themes were identified: (1) The dysmenorrhea symptom experience varied among women; (2) The dysmenorrhea symptom experience varied across time, (3) A variety of factors influenced the dysmenorrhea symptom experience, (4) Dysmenorrhea symptoms could have a negative impact on the women's daily lives, (5) Dysmenorrhea was not seen as a legitimate health issue by the women, health care providers, or society, and (6) Treatment for women with dysmenorrhea varied in acceptability and effectiveness.

131566,[Risk Communication and Community Engagement in the COVID-19 Pandemic in Portugal].,2020-12-03,"Purpose Health systems are periodically confronted by crises - think of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, H1N1, and Ebola - during which they are called upon to manage exceptional situations without interrupting essential services to the population. The ability to accomplish this dual mandate is at the heart of resilience strategies, which in healthcare systems involve developing surge capacity to manage a sudden influx of patients. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach This paper relates insights from resilience research to the four ""S"" of surge capacity (staff, stuff, structures and systems) and proposes a framework based on complexity theory to better understand and assess resilience factors that enable the development of surge capacity in complex health systems. Findings Detailed and dynamic complexities manifest in different challenges during a crisis. Resilience factors are classified according to these types of complexity and along their temporal dimensions: proactive factors that improve preparedness to confront both usual and exceptional requirements, and passive factors that enable response to unexpected demands as they arise during a crisis. The framework is completed by further categorizing resilience factors according to their stabilizing or destabilizing impact, drawing on feedback processes described in complexity theory. Favorable order resilience factors create consistency and act as stabilizing forces in systems, while favorable disorder factors such as diversity and complementarity act as destabilizing forces. Originality/value The framework suggests a balanced and innovative process to integrate these factors in a pragmatic approach built around the fours ""S"" of surge capacity to increase health system resilience.","Therrien, Marie-Christine; Normandin, Julie-Maude; Denis, Jean-Louis",Journal of health organization and management,https://doi.org/10.1108/jhom-04-2016-0067; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28260411/,336
131985,"Risk factors for depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms in perinatal women during the COVID-19 Pandemic.",2020-11-04,"PURPOSE Some classes of glucose-lowering medications, including sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) and glucagon-like peptide 1-receptor agonists (GLP1-RAs) have cardio-protective benefit, but it is unclear whether this influences prescribing in the United Kingdom (UK). This study aims to describe class-level prescribing in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) by cardiovascular disease (CVD) history using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). METHODS Four cross-sections of people with T2DM aged 18-90 and registered with their general practice for >1 year on 1st January 2017 (n = 166,012), 1st January 2018 (n = 155,290), 1st January 2019 (n = 152,602) and 31st December 2019 (n = 143,373) were identified. Age-standardised proportions for class use through time were calculated separately in those with and without CVD history and by total number of medications prescribed (one, two, three, four+). An analysis by UK country was also performed. FINDINGS Around 31% of patients had CVD history at each cross-section. Metformin was the most common treatment (>70% of those with and without CVD had prescriptions across all treatment lines). Overall use of SGLT2is and GLP1-RAs was low, with slightly less use in patients with CVD (SGLT2i: 9.8% and 13.8% in those with and without CVD respectively; GLP1-RA: 4.3% and 4.9%, December 2019). Use of SGLT2is as part of dual therapy was low but rose throughout the study. In January 2017, estimated use was 8.0% (95% CI 6.9-9.1%) and 8.9% (8.6-9.3%) in those with and without CVD. By December 2019 this reached 18.3% (17.0-19.5%) and 21.2% (20.6-21.7%) for those with and without CVD respectively. SGLT2i use as triple therapy increased: 22.7% (21.0-24.4%) and 25.9% (25.2-26.6%) in January 2017 to 41.3% (39.5-43.0%) and 45.5% (44.7-46.3%) in December 2019. GLP1-RA use also increased, but observed usage remained lower than SGLT2 inhibitors. Insulin use remained stable throughout, with higher use observed in those with CVD (16% vs 9.7% Dec 2019). Time trends in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland were similar, although class prevalence varied. IMPLICATIONS Although use of SGLT2is and GLP1-RAs has increased, overall usage remains low with slightly lower use in those with CVD history, suggesting there is opportunity to optimise use of these medicines in T2DM patients to manage CVD risk. Insulin use was substantially more prevalent in those with CVD despite no evidence of CVD benefit. Further investigation of factors influencing this finding may highlight strategies to improve patient access to the most appropriate treatments, including those with evidence of cardiovascular benefit.","Farmer, Ruth E; Beard, Ivan; Raza, Syed I; Gollop, Nicholas D; Patel, Niraj; Tebboth, Abigail; McGovern, Andrew P; Kanumilli, Naresh; Ternouth, Andrew",Clinical therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinthera.2020.12.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33581878/,336

Because of its congenital aetiology, Morgagni hernias are rarely considered in the differential diagnosis of gastric outlet obstruction symptoms in adults. We present a patient with an incarcerated Morgagni hernia who presented with gastric outlet obstruction. A 77-year-old woman presented with symptoms and signs of gastric outlet obstruction, dehydration and acute renal impairment. She was treated by fluid resuscitation and nasogastric tube insertion. Radiological imaging showed a Morgagni hernia containing stomach, omentum and colon. This was treated surgically via an abdominal approach and the defect was closed with mesh. The patient recovered well from this procedure and was discharged. We discuss the anatomy, clinical presentation and surgical treatment of this rare diaphragmatic hernia to raise awareness among surgeons and surgical trainees.","Griffiths, Ewen A; Ellis, Andrew; Mohamed, Ahmed; Tam, Eddie; Ball, Chris S",BMJ case reports,https://doi.org/10.1136/bcr.01.2010.2608; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22791842/,336

While molecular and rapid antigen tests are targeted for early diagnosis, immunoassays have a larger role in epidemiological studies, understanding longitudinal immunity, and in vaccine development and response. METHODS The performance of the LIAISON® SARS-CoV-2 TrimericS IgG assay was evaluated against the Beckman ACCESS SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay in New Mexico, and against the Siemens ADVIA Centaur COV2G assay in New York. Discordant samples were parsed using a microneutralization assay. RESULTS A SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity rate of 23.8% was observed in the samples tested in New York (September 2020), while in the same month the positivity rate was 1.5% in New Mexico. Positive and negative agreement were 67.6% (95% CI 49.5-82.6%) and 99.8% (95% CI 99.5-99.9%), respectively, with the Beckman test, and 98.0% (95% CI 95.7-99.3%) and 94.8% (95% CI 93.4-96.0%), respectively, with the Siemens test. Receiver operating characteristic analysis for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies discloses an AUC, area under the curve, of 0.996 (95% CI 0.992-0.999) for the LIAISON® SARS-CoV-2 TrimericS IgG assay. The criterion associated to the Youden Index was determined to be >12.9 kAU/L with a sensitivity of 99.44% and a specificity of 99.82%. CONCLUSIONS The LIAISON® SARS-CoV-2 TrimericS IgG assay is highly sensitive and specific. The balance of these parameters, without emphasis on high specificity alone, is particularly important when applied to high prevalence populations, where a highly sensitive assay will result in reporting a lower number of false negative subjects.","Bonelli, Fabrizio; Blocki, Frank A; Bunnell, Tina; Chu, Edward; De La O, Arriel; Grenache, David G; Marzucchi, Ginevra; Montomoli, Emanuele; Okoye, Lilian; Pallavicini, Luca; Streva, Vincent A; Torelli, Alessandro; Wagner, Aaron; Zanin, Davide; Zierold, Claudia; Wassenberg, James J",Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.1515/cclm-2021-0023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33711225/,336

Timely recovery of liver volume is a key factor for improving prognosis and post-operative mortality of patients undergone liver resection. The aim of the present study was to compare liver regeneration after laparoscopic over open partial hepatectomy. METHODS Wistar rats were subjected to laparoscopic 70% hepatectomy (group LAP-HEP), open 70% hepatectomy (group HEP), sham operation (group Sham) or no intervention (group Control). At various timepoints following operation (1 h-2 weeks), the liver was excised to assess relative liver weight, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) levels, mitotic activity, tissue expression of Nuclear Factor-κB (NFκB), Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and the histopathologic profile. RESULTS No differences were seen in relative liver weight between hepatectomy groups. Mitotic index was increased in all operative study groups, being higher in group LAP-HEP than in group HEP. TBARS levels were higher in group LAP-HEP compared to group HEP. NFκB and VCAM-1 tissue expression scores were increased in all operative study groups with VCAM-1 being higher in group HEP, while ICAM-1 was overexpressed only in hepatectomy groups. Mild histopathologic lesions were noted in hepatectomy groups with the histopathologic score being higher in group HEP (24 h). CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic liver resection enhanced hepatocyte mitotic activity which was accompanied by mild oxidative stress and a less pronounced local inflammatory response and tissue injury to that of the open technique.","Ypsilantis, Petros; Lambropoulou, Maria; Anagnostopoulos, Konstantinos; Panidou-Tsoulou, Eleni; Ioannidis, Orestis; Totsi, Albion; Pitiakoudis, Michael; Simopoulos, Constantinos",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-019-07257-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31741154/,336

Furthermore, we demonstrate a method for laparoscopic defect repair. PRESENTATION OF CASE A 44-year-old Caucasian female presented to our hospital with strange gurgling sounds and a painless subdermal swelling in her lower back after resection of a presacral neurinoma two years earlier. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a huge rectocele through a sacral defect extending into the subcutaneous tissue. We performed a laparoscopic defect repair with the implantation of a self-fixating mesh graft. Five days after surgery, the patient was discharged in a good general condition. Five months after the operation, a follow-up MRI showed a good postoperative result with the correct position of the rectum. DISCUSSION The repair of transsacral prolapses with attachment of a mesh is complicated by the high rigidity of the pelvis and its surrounding structures. The key criteria in choosing the method of operative approach are the size and content of the prolapse. Huge sacral defects with bowel prolapses require a transabdominal approach to enable repositioning the bowel into the abdomen and excluding bowel injuries and inner hernias. CONCLUSION A laparoscopic approach provides a good intraoperative visibility for a safe retrorectal preparation and mesh graft repair of sacral defects.","Scheuermann, Uwe; Bartsch, Fabian; Jansen-Winkeln, Boris; Lang, Hauke; Kneist, Werner",International journal of surgery case reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijscr.2016.01.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26826936/,336

136514,Outcomes of a Student-Led Telemedicine Clinic in Response to COVID-19.,2021,"BACKGROUND To describe the psychosocial response of the infertile population whose care was curtailed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS A web-based cross-sectional survey was administered to 117 infertile patients at our center who had their infertility treatment delayed due to suspension of care at our hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey consisted of 52-question multiple-choice questions including the Life Orientation Test-Revised (LOT-R) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) instruments. Characteristics of respondents who ""agreed"" (strongly agree and agree) that ""delaying treatment has permanently impacted my chances at future conception"" were compared with participants who ""disagreed"" (neutral, disagree, and strongly disagree) using Fischer's exact test. RESULTS In total, 79.5% agreed that delaying treatment has permanently impacted their chances at future conception. There were no discernible demographic differences between patients who ""agreed"" versus ""disagreed"" with the above statement. The mean LOT-R score was 14.1 (5.1) with an optimism score of 6.8 (2.6) and a pessimism score of 7.3 (2.9). The mean HADS depression score was 5.4 (3.4) with 28.2% reporting scores in the borderline-abnormal to abnormal range. The mean HADS anxiety score was 9.0 (3.9) with 64.6% reporting scores in the borderline-abnormal to abnormal range. Nearly one third of respondents (36.8%) reported wanting to ""expedite/be more aggressive with treatment,"" whereas only 5.1% wanted to postpone treatment.

High-resolution X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) are consistent with the formation of cobalt vacancies at tetrahedral sites and an increase in the lattice parameter of Co3O4 after the laser treatment. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) further reveal increased disorder in the structure and a slight decrease in the average oxidation state of the cobalt oxide. Molecular dynamics simulation confirms the surface restructuring upon laser post-treatment on Co3O4. Importantly, the defect-induced PLPP was shown to lower the charge transfer resistance and boost the oxygen evolution activity of Co3O4. For the optimized sample, a 2-fold increment of current density at 1.7 V vs RHE is obtained and the overpotential at 10 mA/cm2 decreases remarkably from 405 to 357 mV compared to pristine Co3O4.

This critical review assesses methodological limitations in this body of research that have not received adequate attention. METHODS Scientific publications presenting empirical research on medical students' or physicians' empathy were systematically searched for. RESULTS 206 publications were identified and critically reviewed. Multiple empirical approaches have been used. However, there are some remarkable tendencies given the complexity of the study object: empathy is often not defined. Qualitative approaches are rarely used and the predominant quantitative instruments have a relatively narrow or peripheral scope. For example, the concrete experiences, feelings, and interpretations of the physician and the patient, and empathy in clinical practice, are often neglected. Furthermore, possible influences of medical training and working conditions on empathy have not been adequately explored. CONCLUSION The empirical studies of empathy in medicine tend to separate empathy from main parts of clinical perception, judgment, and communication. Thus, important aspects and influences of empathy have been relatively neglected. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS Future studies should include transparent concepts, more than one method and perspective, qualitative approaches, the physician's and the patient's concrete experiences and interpretations, and the context in which empathy is developed and practiced.","Pedersen, Reidar",Patient education and counseling,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pec.2009.06.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19631488/,336

141896,Suicidal ideation associated with depression and social support: a survey-based analysis of older adults in South Korea.,2021-08-18,"BACKGROUND The ""obesity paradox"" suggests that higher body mass index (BMI) is associated with better survival values in metastatic melanoma patients, especially those receiving targeted and immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Higher BMI is also associated with higher incidences of treatment-related adverse events. This study assesses whether body mass index is associated with survival outcomes and adverse events in metastatic melanoma patients with systemic therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS This multicentric retrospective study, conducted from March 1, 2013 to April 29, 2019, enrolled adults with unresectable stage III or IV melanoma from the French multicentric prospective cohort-MelBase (NCT02828202). Patients with first-line chemotherapy and targeted and immune therapy were included. Underweight people and those with metastatic mucosal or ocular melanoma were excluded. Body mass index was categorized using the World Health Organization criteria. Co-primary outcomes included the association between body mass index and progression-free survival and overall survival, stratified by treatment type, sex and age. Secondary endpoints were the association of body mass index with overall response and treatment-related adverse events. Multivariate analyses were performed. RESULTS Totally, 1,214 patients were analyzed. Their median age was 66.0 years (range, 53-75). Male predominance was observed (n = 738 [61%]). Most patients received immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy (63%), followed by targeted therapy (32%), and had stage M1c disease (60.5%). Obese patients represented 22% of the cohort. The median follow-up duration was 13.5 months (range, 6.0-27.5). In the pooled analysis, no positive or negative association between body mass index and progression-free survival (p = 0.88)/overall survival (p = 0.25) was observed, regardless of treatment type, sex, and age. These results were nonsignificant in the univariate and multivariate analyses. The objective response rate, according to body mass index category, did not differ significantly regardless of age. Treatment-related adverse events were not associated with body mass index. CONCLUSION The observed lack of an association between body mass index and survival demonstrates that body mass index is not a valuable marker of systemic treatment-related outcomes in metastatic melanoma. Future approaches might focus on the whole-body distribution.","Di Filippo, Y; Dalle, S; Mortier, L; Dereure, O; Dalac, S; Dutriaux, C; Leccia, M-T; Legoupil, D; Saiag, P; Brunet-Possenti, F; Arnnault, J-P; Maubec, E; Granel-Brocard, F; De Quatrebarbes, J; Aubin, F; Lesimple, T; Beylot-Barry, M; Stoebner, P-E; Dupuy, A; Stephan, A; Grob, J-J; Lefevre, W; Oriano, B; Allayous, C; Lebbé, C; Montaudié, H",Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.12.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33385520/,336
142400,COVID-19 and respiratory protection for healthcare providers.,2020-11-24,"Dietary intake of linoleic acid (LA, 18:2ω-6) has risen dramatically in recent decades. Previous studies have suggested high intake of LA could increase tissue concentrations of pro-inflammatory and pro-tumorigenic ω-6-series eicosanoid metabolites, increasing risks of inflammation and associated diseases. However, the effects of LA-rich diet on in vivo profiles of eicosanoids and development of inflammatory diseases are under-studied. Here we treated spontaneous colitis-prone (Il-10-/-) mice with a control diet (~3 Cal% LA) or a LA-rich diet (~9 Cal% LA) for 18 weeks, and analyzed the effects of the LA-rich diet on profiles of eicosanoids and development of colitis. We found that treatment with the LA-rich diet increased tissue level of LA: the liver levels of LA were 5.8 ± 0.6% in control diet-treated mice versus 11.7 ± 0.7% in LA-rich diet-treated mice (P < 0.01). The plasma concentrations of a series of LA-derived metabolites, including 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (HODE), 9,10-dihydroxyoctadecenoic acid (DiHOME), 12,13-DiHOME, and 13-HODE were significantly increased by treatment with the LA-rich diet (P < 0.05). However, LA-rich diet had little effect on the severity of colitis in the treated Il-10-/- mice. These results suggest a limited role of increased consumption of dietary LA on promoting colitis in Il-10-/- model.","Xie, Minhao; Yang, Jun; Zhang, Jianan; Sherman, Heather L; Zhang, Zhenyu; Minter, Lisa M; Hammock, Bruce D; Park, Yeonhwa; Zhang, Guodong",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.0c03024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32594738/,336

This study was conducted in order to provide a descriptive systematic review of research on factors influencing parents' and children's misperceptions of children's weight status published in the past 5 years. RECENT FINDINGS Factors studied most often in relation to parents' and children's misperception included children's weight status, gender, and age, as well as parents' weight status, parental education levels and socioeconomic status, and ethnicity. Most determinants that were found to have a significant influence on misperception in parents also did in children. The literature on misperception of children's weight status is extensive. Most determinants assessed in included studies were known determinants of childhood obesity. Further research should be directed toward better understanding the impact of weight status perception (whether it is accurate or not) on health behaviors and weight gain over time.","Blanchet, Rosanne; Kengneson, Cris-Carelle; Bodnaruc, Alexandra M; Gunter, Ashley; Giroux, Isabelle",Current obesity reports,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13679-019-00361-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31701349/,336

Physical examination revealed no cyanosis or wasting, and no audible heart murmur was auscultated. Blood profile revealed mild anaemia and mildly elevated postprandial serum ammonia (109 µg/dl). Abdominal ultrasonography revealed dilation of an intrahepatic portal vein branch and an intrahepatic aneurysm, with splenomegaly and ascites. Hepatic arteriovenous fistula/hepatic artery-portal vein fistula with multiple acquired portosystemic shunts was strongly suspected. Medical control was achieved using antibiotics, liver-protecting agents, a low-protein diet and blood transfusions. However, because medical treatment proved ineffective, coil embolisation was performed on day 11, using a hybrid approach via the mesenteric vein. Subsequent follow-up showed good appetite, with no signs of diarrhoea or ascites. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed that the mosaic pattern around the site of coil placement in the portal vein branch had improved and pulsatility had disappeared. RELEVANCE AND NOVEL INFORMATION Intrahepatic arterioportal fistula involves a circulatory shunt between the hepatic artery and the hepatic or portal vein within the liver, and may be congenital or acquired. Both forms have been reported in humans, but most cases in cats have been congenital. Few reports have described treatment methods or prognosis in cats. We report here that coil embolisation using a hybrid approach is a procedure offering easy, effective treatment by blocking hepatofugal blood flow.","Uemura, Akiko; Haruyama, Takashi; Nakata, Mary; Fukayama, Toshiharu; Goya, Seijirow; Fukushima, Ryuji; Tanaka, Ryou",JFMS open reports,https://doi.org/10.1177/2055116916642256; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28491418/,336

The authors study the problem of allocating limited control resources (e.g. quarantine or recovery resources) in these networks in a way that exploits the topological structure, so as to maximise the speed at which the virus is eliminated. For both multi-group and contact-network models for spread, these problems can be abstracted to a particular decentralised control problem for which the goal is to minimise the dominant eigenvalue of a system matrix. Explicit solutions to these problems are provided, using eigenvalue sensitivity ideas together with constrained optimisation methods employing Lagrange multipliers. The proposed design method shows that the optimal strategy is to allocate resources so as to equalise the propagation impact of each network component, as best as possible within the constraints on the resource. Finally, we show that this decentralised control approach can provide significant advantage over a homogeneous control strategy, in the context of a model for SARS transmission in Hong Kong.","Wan, Y; Roy, S; Saberi, A",IET systems biology,https://doi.org/10.1049/iet-syb:20070040; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18681748/,336

Our study aimed to explore the association between obesity and the negative outcomes of COVID-19 worldwide. The prevalence of obesity and overweight per country was extracted from the World Health Organization information system and, for measuring the COVID-19 negative outcomes, we calculated the cumulated notification rate and the mortality for the interval since starting of pandemic till the 29th of November 2020. We explored the linear relationship between COVID-19 and obesity by a bivariate Spearman rank correlation, interpreted using the rule of thumb for 95% level of confidence. We found globally a positive, moderate, and statistically significant correlation between prevalence of obesity and overweight and the negative outcomes of COVID-19.

It is mainly induced by shear stress affecting the erythrocyte membrane. There are many investigations about haemolysis in laminar and turbulent blood flow. The results defined as threshold levels for the damage of erythrocytes depend on the exposure time of the shear stress, but they are very different, depending on the used experimental methods or the calculation strategy. Here, the results are resumed and shown in curves. Different models for the calculation of the strengths of erythrocytes are discussed. There are few results reported about tests of haemolysis in blood pumps, but some theoretical approaches for the design of continuous flow blood pumps according to low haemolysis have been investigated within the last years.","Köhne, Inge",Perfusion,https://doi.org/10.1177/0267659120931307; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32571178/,336

The two isomers of linalool, (R)-linalool and (S)-linalool, both exist in tea leaves. Our study found that (R)-linalool was the minor isomer in nine of Camellia sinensis var. sinensis cultivars. The (R)-linalool synthase of tea plant CsRLIS was identified subsequently. It is a chloroplast-located protein and specifically catalyzes formation of (R)-linalool in vitro and in vivo. CsRLIS was observed to be a stress-responsive gene, and caused the accumulation of internal (R)-linalool during oolong tea manufacture, mechanical wounding, and insect attack. Further study demonstrated that the catalytic efficiency of CsRLIS was much lower than (S)-linalool synthase CsSLIS, which might explain the lower (R)-linalool proportion in C. sinensis var. sinensis cultivars. The relative expression levels of CsRLIS and CsSLIS may also affect the (R)-linalool proportions among C. sinensis var. sinensis cultivars. The information will help us understand differential distributions of chiral aroma compounds in tea.","Zhou, Ying; Deng, Rufang; Xu, Xinlan; Yang, Ziyin",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.0c04381; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32829629/,336

However, the experience in the pediatric population is limited. Minimally invasive esophagectomy represents a new alternative technique to the conventional open approach. We wish to report our small case series of minimally invasive esophagectomy and gastric pull-up in pediatric patients. The aim of the study is to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and outcomes of the procedure. METHODS Three patients (2 girls and 1 boy) with average age 46 months (34-57 months) and average weight 12.6 kg (11-15 kg) underwent the procedure. The indications for esophagectomy were esophageal stricture from caustic ingestion (2 patients) and failed repair of esophageal atresia (1 patient). RESULTS Average operative time was 7 h (0519-0752 hours). There were no intraoperative complications with the average blood loss of 50 cc (5-125 cc). No anastomotic leaks were noted on the initial esophagrams that were obtained on postoperative day five or six. One patient developed a cervical wound infection on postoperative day seven due to a retained piece of Penrose, which required a neck exploration, removal of foreign body and repair of a small leak. One patient developed an anastomotic stricture at the 7-month follow-up. She was successfully treated with two balloon dilatations. One patient developed a delayed esophagogastric anastomotic leak at 3 months. The leak spontaneously closed after surgical drainage. At average of 22-month follow-up (15-36 months), all patients were eating regular food with excellent weight gain. CONCLUSION Minimally invasive esophagectomy and gastric pull-up is technically challenging but feasible and safe with acceptable outcomes. However, further study is needed to further validate the approach.","Garrett, Deiadra; Anselmo, Dean; Ford, Henri; Ndiforchu, Fombe; Nguyen, Nam",Pediatric surgery international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00383-011-2862-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21350873/,336

We studied how these behaviors evolved during re-opening the possible contributions of continued working from home and smartphone usage. METHODS Participants (N=198) were studied through the lockdown and subsequent reopening period, using a wearable sleep/activity tracker, smartphone-delivered ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and passive smartphone usage tracking. Work/study location was obtained through daily EMA ascertainment. RESULTS Upon re-opening, earlier, shorter sleep and increased physical activity were observed, alongside increased self-rated stress and poorer evening mood ratings. These re-opening changes were affected by post-lockdown work arrangements and patterns of smartphone usage. Individuals who returned to work or school in-person tended towards larger shifts to earlier sleep and wake timings. Returning to in-person work/school also correlated with more physical activity. Contrary to expectation, there was no decrease in objectively measured smartphone usage after reopening. A cluster analysis showed that persons with relatively heavier smartphone use prior to bedtime had later sleep timings and lower physical activity. CONCLUSIONS these observations indicate that the re-opening after lockdown was accompanied by earlier sleep timing, increased physical activity, and altered mental wellbeing. Moreover, these changes were affected by work/study arrangements and smartphone usage patterns.","Massar, Stijn A A; Ng, Alyssa S C; Soon, Chun Siong; Ong, Ju Lynn; Chua, Xin Yu; Chee, Nicholas I Y N; Lee, Tih Shih; Chee, Michael W L",Sleep,https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsab250; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34636396/,336

Doctors were interviewed during April-July 2020. RESULTS Three major themes related to problems during the first year of operation of the Act were identified: the statutory prohibition of health professionals initiating discussions with their patients about voluntary assisted dying; the Department of Health and Human Services guidance requirement that all doctor-patient, doctor-pharmacist, and pharmacist-patient interactions be face-to-face; and aspects of implementation, including problems with the voluntary assisted dying online portal, obtaining documentary evidence to establish eligibility, and inadequate resourcing of the Statewide Pharmacy Service. CONCLUSIONS Doctors reported only limited concerns about the Victorian voluntary assisted dying legislation, but have had some problems with its operation, including implications for the accessibility of voluntary assisted dying to eligible patients. While legislative change may resolve some of these concerns, most can be ameliorated by improving the processes and systems.","Willmott, Lindy; White, Ben P; Sellars, Marcus; Yates, Patsy M",The Medical journal of Australia,https://doi.org/10.5694/mja2.51123; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34109641/,336

Systematic search of Medline, Embase and PsycINFO was conducted in October 2017. Outcomes were: 50%+ seizure reduction, complete seizure freedom; improved quality of life (QoL). Tolerability/safety were assessed by study withdrawals, adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs). Analyses were conducted in Stata V.15.0. 36 studies were identified: 6 randomised controlled trials (RCTs), 30 observational studies. Mean age of participants was 16.1 years (range 0.5-55 years). Cannabidiol (CBD) 20 mg/kg/day was more effective than placebo at reducing seizure frequency by 50%+(relative risk (RR) 1.74, 95% CI 1.24 to 2.43, 2 RCTs, 291 patients, low Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) rating). The number needed to treat for one person using CBD to experience 50%+ seizure reduction was 8 (95% CI 6 to 17). CBD was more effective than placebo at achieving complete seizure freedom (RR 6.17, 95% CI 1.50 to 25.32, 3 RCTs, 306 patients, low GRADE rating), and improving QoL (RR 1.73, 95% CI 1.33 to 2.26), however increased risk of AEs (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.36) and SAEs (RR 2.55, 95% CI 1.48 to 4.38). Pooled across 17 observational studies, 48.5% (95% CI 39.0% to 58.1%) of patients reported 50%+ reductions in seizures; in 14 observational studies 8.5% (95% CI 3.8% to 14.5%) were seizure-free. Twelve observational studies reported improved QoL (55.8%, 95% CI 40.5 to 70.6); 50.6% (95% CI 31.7 to 69.4) AEs and 2.2% (95% CI 0 to 7.9) SAEs.

Preoperative PTC plasma miRNA expression (n = 49) was compared with plasma miRNA in the HC group (n = 57) and patients with NG (n = 23). It was demonstrated that miR-221; miR-222; miR-146b; miR-21 and miR-181b were overexpressed in preoperative PTC plasma samples compared to HC (p < 0.0001; p < 0.0001; p < 0.0001; p < 0.0001; p < 0.002; respectively). The upregulation in tumor tissue of these miRNAs was consistent with The Cancer Genome Atlas Thyroid Carcinoma dataset.

How pneumonia impacts neurological recovery after TBI is not well characterized. We hypothesized that, independent of the cerebral injury, pneumonia after TBI delays and worsens neurological recovery and cognitive outcomes. METHODS Fifteen CD1 male mice were randomized to sham craniotomy or severe TBI (controlled cortical impact (CCI) - velocity 6m/s, depth 1.0mm) ± intratracheal lipopolysaccharide (LPS-2mg/kg in 0.1ml saline) as a pneumonia bioeffector. Neurological functional recovery by Garcia Neurologic Testing (GNT) and body weight loss were recorded daily for 14 days. On days 6-14, animals underwent Morris Water Maze (MWM) learning and memory testing with Cued Trials (platform visible), Spatial Learning Trials (platform invisible, spatial cues present), and Probe (memory) Trials (platform removed, spatial clues present). Intergroup differences were assessed by the Kruskal-Wallis test with Bonferroni correction (p<0.05). RESULTS Weight loss was greatest in the CCI+LPS group (maximum 24% on Day 3 vs. 8% [Sham], 7% [CCI], both on Day 1). GNT was lowest in CCI+LPS during the first week. MWM testing demonstrated greater spatial learning impairment in the CCI+LPS group vs. Sham or CCI counterparts. Cued learning and long-term memory were worse in CCI+LPS and CCI as compared to Sham. CONCLUSION A pneumonia bioeffector insult after TBI worsens weight loss and mortality in a rodent model. Not only is spatial learning impaired, but animals are more debilitated and have worse neurologic performance.

Although many patients undergoing MPI receive repeat MPI testing, or additional procedures involving ionizing radiation, no data are available characterizing their total longitudinal radiation burden and relating radiation burden with reasons for testing. OBJECTIVES To characterize procedure counts, cumulative estimated effective doses of radiation, and clinical indications for patients undergoing MPI. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS A retrospective cohort study of 1097 consecutive patients undergoing index MPI during the first 100 days of 2006 (January 1-April 10) at Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, that evaluated all preceding medical imaging procedures involving ionizing radiation undergone beginning October 1988, and all subsequent procedures through June 2008, at the center. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Cumulative estimated effective dose of radiation, number of procedures involving radiation, and indications for testing. RESULTS Patients underwent a median of 15 (interquartile range [IQR], 6-32; mean, 23.9) procedures involving radiation exposure; of which 4 (IQR, 2-8; mean, 6.5) were high-dose procedures (≥3 mSv; ie, 1 year's background radiation), including 1 (IQR, 1-2; mean, 1.8) MPI study per patient. A total of 344 patients (31.4%) received cumulative estimated effective dose from all medical sources of more than 100 mSv. Multiple MPIs were performed in 424 patients (38.6%), for whom cumulative estimated effective dose was 121 mSv (IQR, 81-189; mean, 149 mSv). Men and white patients had higher cumulative estimated effective doses. More than 80% of initial and 90% of repeat MPI examinations were performed in patients with known cardiac disease or symptoms consistent with it.

155942,"Bilateral paediatric cataract surgery - outcomes of 298 children from Kinshasa, the Democratic Republic of the Congo.",2020-12-01,"Adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience high rates of both unemployment and depression. Though job loss predicts increased risk of depression in the general population, studies have yet to directly examine this relationship among individuals with ASD. With the backdrop of rising unemployment due to COVID-19, we used a longitudinal design to examine whether employment changes predicted increasing depressive symptoms among young adults with ASD. Online surveys were collected from young adults with ASD at two times: just before widespread social distancing measures were adopted in the United States, and again 10 weeks later. Both time points included measurement of depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory-2). At Time 2, COVID-related employment changes and the perceived impact of those changes on well-being were collected. Of the young adults who were employed at Time 1 (n = 144), over one-third (37.5%) reported employment changes during the first 2 months of COVID-19. Most of this change was job loss or reductions in hours or pay (""job loss/reduction""). Controlling for Time 1 depressive symptoms, young adults who experienced job loss/reduction had significantly higher depressive symptoms at Time 2 than those without an employment change. Individuals' perceived impact of employment change also predicted depressive symptoms. These findings suggest that losing a job or experiencing reductions in hours or pay leads to worsening depressive symptoms among adults with ASD. Better supporting autistic adults in the workplace may not only decrease the likelihood of job loss, but also combat the exceedingly high rates of depression in this group. LAY SUMMARY: Though unemployment has been linked to mental health problems in the general population, this relationship is seldom considered among adults with autism. In this study, we found that adults on the autism spectrum who lost their jobs or experienced reductions in pay or hours during the first 2 months of COVID-19 had worsening depression compared to adults who did not have job changes. Our findings suggest that increasing access to employment may help alleviate poor mental health among autistic adults.","Taylor, Julie Lounds; Adams, Ryan E; Pezzimenti, Florencia; Zheng, Shuting; Bishop, Somer L",Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research,https://doi.org/10.1002/aur.2621; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34626164/,336

Diseases caused by this fungus are of concern, due to its reduced susceptibility to several antifungals. C. auris exhibits paradoxical growth (PG; defined as growth at high, but not intermediate antifungal concentrations) in the presence of caspofungin (CPF). We have characterized the cellular changes associated with adaptation to CPF. Using EUCAST AFST protocols, all C. auris isolates tested showed PG to CPF, although in some isolates it was more prominent. Most isolates also showed a trailing effect (TE) to micafungin and anidulafungin. We identified two FKS genes in C. auris that encode the echinocandins target, namely β-1,3-glucan synthase. FKS1 contained the consensus hot-spot (HS) 1 and HS2 sequences. FKS2 only contained the HS1 region which had a change (F635Y), that has been shown to confer resistance to echinocandins in C. glabrata. PG has been characterized in other species, mainly C. albicans, where high CPF concentrations induced an increase in chitin, cell volume and aggregation. In C. auris CPF only induced a slight accumulation of chitin, and none of the other phenomena. RNAseq experiments demonstrated that CPF induced the expression of genes encoding several GPI-anchored cell wall proteins, membrane proteins required for the stability of the cell wall, chitin synthase and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) involved in cell integrity, such as BCK2, HOG1 and MKC1 (SLT2). Our work highlights some of the processes induced in C. auris to adapt to echinocandins.","Lara-Aguilar, Violeta; Rueda, Cristina; García-Barbazán, Irene; Varona, Sarai; Monzón, Sara; Jiménez, Pilar; Cuesta, Isabel; Zaballos, Ángel; Zaragoza, Óscar",Virulence,https://doi.org/10.1080/21505594.2021.1927609; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34180774/,336

In contrast to previous contributions using pH as a control parameter of interactions, we investigated an unprecedentedly wide range of concentrations and particle/substrate DLVO forces by modifying the nature of the substrate and particles as well as their size and surface chemistry whereas long-distance repulsive interactions between particles were maintained for most of the drying time. Our main result is that the different shapes of deposits obtained by modifying the particle concentration are the same in the different regimes of concentration regardless of particle/substrate interaction in the studied range of DLVO forces and particle concentrations. The second result is that, contrary to expectations, the dominant morphology of dry patterns at low particle concentration always shows a dot-like pattern for all the studied systems.","Bridonneau, Nathalie; Zhao, Menghua; Battaglini, Nicolas; Mattana, Giorgio; Thevenet, Véonique; Noel, Vincent; Roché, Matthieu; Zrig, Samia; Carn, Florent",Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c01546; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32911931/,336

159400,Change in the Incidence of Stillbirth and Preterm Delivery During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020-07-10,"Neisseria meningitidis serogroup C is a major cause of bacterial meningitis and septicaemia. This human pathogen is protected by a capsule composed of alpha2,9-linked polysialic acid that represents an important virulence factor. In the majority of strains, the capsular polysaccharide is modified by O-acetylation at C-7 or C-8 of the sialic acid residues. The gene encoding the capsule modifying O-acetyltransferase is part of the capsule gene complex and shares no sequence similarities with other proteins. Here, we describe the purification and biochemical characterization of recombinant OatC. The enzyme was found as a homodimer, with the first 34 amino acids forming an efficient oligomerization domain that worked even in a different protein context. Using acetyl-CoA as donor substrate, OatC transferred acetyl groups exclusively onto polysialic acid joined by alpha2,9-linkages and did not act on free or CMP-activated sialic acid. Motif scanning revealed a nucleophile elbow motif (GXS286XGG), which is a hallmark of alpha/beta-hydrolase fold enzymes. In a comprehensive site-directed mutagenesis study, we identified a catalytic triad composed of Ser-286, Asp-376, and His-399. Consistent with a double-displacement mechanism common to alpha/beta-hydrolase fold enzymes, a covalent acetylenzyme intermediate was found. Together with secondary structure prediction highlighting an alpha/beta-hydrolase fold topology, our data provide strong evidence that OatC belongs to the alpha/beta-hydrolase fold family. This clearly distinguishes OatC from all other bacterial sialate O-acetyltransferases known so far because these are members of the hexapeptide repeat family, a class of acyltransferases that adopt a left-handed beta-helix fold and assemble into catalytic trimers.","Bergfeld, Anne K; Claus, Heike; Lorenzen, Nina K; Spielmann, Fabian; Vogel, Ulrich; Mühlenhoff, Martina",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m807518200; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18986988/,336

163630,Changes in sleep quality amidst COVID-19 pandemic among psychiatric patients in Romania,2021,"Nowadays there is a world pandemic of a challenging respiratory illness, COVID-19. A large part of COVID-19 patients evolves to severe or fatal complications and require an ICU admission. COVID-19 mortality rate approaches 30% due to complications such as obstruction of the trachea and bronchi of patients during the ICU stay. An endotracheal obstruction occurring during any moment in a COVID-19 patient ICU stay is one of the most complicated situations that clinicians must face and solve. Therefore, it is very important to know in advance when a COVID-19 patient could enter in the pre-obstruction zone. In this work we present an intelligent computing solution to predict endotracheal obstruction for COVID-19 patients in ICU. It is called the Binomial Gate LSTM (BigLSTM), a new and innovative deep modular neural architecture based on the recurrent neural network LSTM. Its main feature is its ability to handle missing data and to deal with time series with no regular sample frequency. These are the main characteristics of the BigLSTM information environment. This ability is implemented in BigLSTM by an information redundancy injection mechanism and how it copes with time control. We applied BigLSTM with first wave COVID-19 patients in ICU of Complejo Hospitalario Universitario Insular Materno Infantil. Encouraging results, even while working with a very small data set, indicate that our developed computing solution is going forwards towards an efficient intelligent prediction system which is very appropriate for this kind of problem. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Fernández-López, P.; Suárez-Araujo, C.

This study examines the experiences of oncologists who engage in complex decision-making regarding the use of chemotherapy in seriously ill persons in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Between January 2020 and August 2020, the authors conducted semistructured, in-depth individual interviews with 22 purposefully sampled oncologists from practices enrolled in the Michigan Oncology Quality Consortium. Transcripts were double-coded and reconciled by consensus using qualitative data analysis software for thematic analysis. Results: Among the thematic clusters we identified, one was related to conundrums created by the COVID-19 pandemic. In this presentation, we report the results pertaining to three themes within this cluster: (1) the ethical dilemmas faced by oncologists due to the COVID-19 pandemic, (2) the need for both patients and oncologists to manage uncertainty and emotions, and (3) the importance and complexity of integrating technology and communication for seriously ill persons. Oncologists grappled with several conundrums including resource scarcity, resource allocation, delays in care, a duty to promote equity and non-abandonment, high levels of uncertainty and fear, and the importance of advanced care directives and end-of-life care planning. Nonabandonment featured as a coping mechanism for increased stress, and integration of communication with telemedicine was frequent and necessary. Conclusions: This study offers an indepth exploration of the conundrums faced by oncologists due to the COVID-19 pandemic and how they navigated them. Optimal decision-making for seriously ill persons with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic must include open acknowledgement of the ethical dilemmas faced, the heightened emotions experienced by both patients and their oncologists, and the urgent need for integrating technology with compassionate communication in determining patient preferences.","Perumalswami, C.

Hospital departments had to adapt their services and expand their bed capacity. Our aim was to lead a team that will create a contingency rota in order to anticipate possible COVID-19 related sickness and support front-line specialities, such as Acute Medicine and Intensive Care.The team involved in the creation of this rota was led by one junior doctor from every grade. Data from the surgical take showed that the average number of daily surgical inpatients dropped from 47 in February, to 22 by the first week of April. This reduction, together with cancellation of elective operations, allowed us to create a contingency plan with a ward cover, an on-call and a stand-by team at all times. We managed to release doctors to support other departments, ensuring that surgical inpatients were receiving the pre-COVID-19 standards of care. We, also, created a ‘buddy system’, predicting possible COVID-19 sickness in the on-call or the ward-cover team. On this contingency rota, there was a ward cover team with one SHO, three FY1s and two registrars, including the team for ITU support and a ‘standby’ ward-cover team. Two of the FY1 doctors were redeployed to reinforce Acute Medicine. There was constant feedback via a ‘WhatsApp’ group from the on-call and the ward-cover team to recruit help from the standby teamAll doctors who were part of this rota were invited to provide feedback via a satisfaction survey. Out of 13 responses, 61.54% replied that they were satisfied or very satisfied with the contingency rota, and 76.92% replied that the rota was fair to very fair.

Thus, rather than invoking a compassionate response, the pandemic is likely to aggravate pre-existing divisions and create an environment that accentuates survival over compassion. Building on a large probability survey data gathered in May 2020 in Turkey, we demonstrate that the pandemic has disproportionally affected minority Kurds and exacerbated pre-existing inequalities and social polarization. Results from a series of regression analyses show growing dissatisfaction with the Turkish government's handling of the pandemic. However, this effect fails to translate into the sense of solidarity between majority Turks and minority Kurds necessary to build a peaceful society.

This study aimed to analyze the variation of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein sequences in ASEAN countries, including Indonesia. METHODS Complete sequences of SARS-CoV-2 N protein from each ASEAN country were obtained from Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID), while the reference sequence was obtained from GenBank. All sequences collected from December 2019 to March 2021 were grouped to the clade according to GISAID, and two representative isolates were chosen from each clade for the analysis. The sequences were aligned by MUSCLE, and phylogenetic trees were built using MEGA-X software based on the nucleotide and translated AA sequences. RESULTS 98 isolates of complete N protein genes from ASEAN countries were analyzed. The nucleotides of all isolates were 97.5% conserved. Of 31 nucleotide changes, 22 led to amino acid (AA) substitutions;thus, the AA sequences were 94.5% conserved. The phylogenetic tree of nucleotide and AA sequences shows similar branches. Nucleotide variations in clade O (C28311T);clade GR (28881-28883 GGG&gt;AAC);and clade GRY (28881-28883 GGG&gt;AAC and C28977T) lead to specific branches corresponding to the clade within both trees. CONCLUSIONS The N protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 across ASEAN countries are highly conserved.

Accumulating evidence supports not only glycaemic benefits with lower HbA1c, reduced glucose variability and reduced hypoglycaemia rates but also improved quality of life and an association with reduction in mortality. Understandably, patient groups list access to technologies as a key priority for living well with diabetes. Despite this, uptake of insulin pumps remains below forecast with variation geographically and between socioeconomic groups. Criteria from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence aim to standardise local commissioning;however, a major barrier to initiating pump services is sufficient staff numbers with appropriate training and experience. To aid growth, services could be better supported to access training and given flexibility in deploying their resources. Collaboration between centres with increasing use of the virtual platform for education and clinical support may address the equity of delivery. There has been proliferation of available devices with differing advantages and limitations;for example compatibility with software and discretion.

However, the characteristics of the THz band, which strictly reduce the communication range inside the human body, together with the energy limitations of nano-nodes make the in-body deployment of nano-nodes a challenging task. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel in-body flow-guided nano-network architecture consisting of three different devices: i) nano-node, ii) nano-router, and iii) bio-sensor. As the performance of this type of nano-network has not been previously explored, a theoretical framework capturing all its particularities is derived to properly model its behavior and evaluate its feasibility in real medical applications.

172930,Denial attitude towards COVID-19 among general population in Saudi Arabia,2021,"The p53/p21 pathway is activated in response to cell stress. However, its role in acute lung injury has not been elucidated. Acute lung injury is associated with disruption of the alveolo-capillary barrier leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Mechanical ventilation may be necessary to support gas exchange in patients with ARDS, however, high positive airway pressures can cause regional overdistension of alveolar units and aggravate lung injury. Here, we report that acute lung injury and alveolar overstretching activate the p53/p21 pathway to maintain homeostasis and avoid massive cell apoptosis. A systematic pooling of transcriptomic data from animal models of lung injury demonstrates the enrichment of specific p53- and p21-dependent gene signatures and a validated senescence profile. In a clinically relevant, murine model of acid aspiration and mechanical ventilation, we observed changes in the nuclear envelope and the underlying chromatin, DNA damage and activation of the Tp53/p21 pathway. Absence of Cdkn1a decreased the senescent response, but worsened lung injury due to increased cell apoptosis. Conversely, treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir led to Cdkn1a overexpression and ameliorated cell apoptosis and lung injury. The activation of these mechanisms was associated with early markers of senescence, including expression of senescence-related genes and increases in senescence-associated heterochromatin foci in alveolar cells. Autopsy samples from lungs of patients with ARDS revealed increased senescence-associated heterochromatin foci. Collectively, these results suggest that acute lung injury activates p53/p21 as an anti-apoptotic mechanism to ameliorate damage, but with the side effect of induction of senescence.","Blázquez-Prieto, Jorge; Huidobro, Covadonga; López-Alonso, Inés; Amado-Rodriguez, Laura; Martín-Vicente, Paula; López-Martínez, Cecilia; Crespo, Irene; Pantoja, Cristina; Fernandez-Marcos, Pablo J; Serrano, Manuel; Sznajder, Jacob I; Albaiceta, Guillermo M",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.24.005983,336

A retrospective study on depressive disorders among psychiatric patients admitted at “elisabeta doamna” hospital galati, romania",2021,"Background: During a pandemic, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) play an important role in protecting oneself from infection and preventing the spread of infection to others. There are large regional differences in COVID-19 infection rates in Japan. We hypothesized that the local infection incidence may affect adherence to individual NPIs. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted online among full-time workers in Japan in December 2020. Data from a total of 27,036 participants were analyzed. The questionnaire asked the respondents to identify their habits regarding seven well-known NPIs. Results: Compared to the region with the lowest infection rate, the odds ratios for the region with the highest infection rate were 1.24 (p<0.001) for wearing a mask in public, 1.08 (p=0.157) for washing hands after using the bathroom, 1.17 (p=0.031) for disinfecting hands with alcohol sanitizers when entering indoors, 1.54 (p<0.001) for gargling when returning home, 1.45 (p<0.001) for ventilating the room, 1.33 (p<0.001) for disinfecting or washing hands after touching frequently touched surfaces, and 1.32 (p<0.001) for carrying alcohol sanitizers when outdoors. Five of the seven NPIs showed statistically significant trends across regional infection levels, the two exceptions being wearing a mask in public and washing hands after using the bathroom. Multivariate adjustment did not change these trends. Conclusions: This study found that NPIs were more prevalent in regions with higher incidence rates of COVID-19 in Japanese workers. The findings suggest that the implementation of NPIs was influenced not only by personal attributes but also by contextual effects of the local infection level.","Anan, T.; Ishimaru, T.; Hino, A.; Nagata, T.; Tateishi, S.; Tsuji, M.; Ogami, A.; Matsuda, S.; Fujino, Y.; project, for the CORoNaWork",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.26.21261107v1?rss=1,336

176354,Remote psychoeducation for eating disorders: An exploratory study during lockdown,2021,"The United States has supported the development of its oil and gas industry since the early twentieth century. Despite repeated pledges to phase out ‘inefficient’ fossil fuel subsidies, US oil and gas production continues to be subsidized by billions of dollars each year. In this study, we quantify how 16 subsidies and regulatory exemptions individually and altogether affect the economics of US oil and gas production in 2020–2030 under different price and financial risk outlooks. We find that, at 2019 average market prices of oil and gas, the 16 subsidies could increase the average rates of return of yet-to-be-developed oil and gas fields by 55% and 68% over unsubsidized levels, respectively, with over 96% of subsidy value flowing to excess profits under a 10% hurdle rate. At lower 2020 prices, the subsidies could increase the average rates of return of new oil and gas fields by 63% and 78% over unsubsidized levels, respectively, with more than 60% of oil and gas resources being dependent on subsidies to be profitable under a 20% hurdle rate. Under all price scenarios analyzed, the highest-value subsidies include federal tax incentives that have existed since 1916, as well as less recognized forms of support such as cost exemptions related to well cleanup and hazardous waste management. Given that these results depend on our chosen definitions of what constitutes a subsidy and, in some cases, assumptions regarding what the unsubsidized practices should be, we also present results for selected subsets of subsidies. By showing which subsidies have the greatest effects in different producing regions of the country, our findings can help policymakers chart a schedule of targeted subsidy repeals and regulatory reforms that can contribute to reducing carbon dioxide emissions and achieving other sustainable development goals. Our results can also help inform how different choices about economic recovery measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic can shape the US oil and gas industry in the years to come.","Achakulwisut, Ploy Erickson Peter Koplow Doug",Environmental Research Letters,https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ac0a10,336

177423,Present tense: A peculiar xase of pemphigus vulgaris presenting with tense blisters during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"CXCL17 is the most recently described chemokine. It is principally expressed by mucosal tissues, where it facilitates chemotaxis of monocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages and has antimicrobial properties. CXCL17 is also implicated in the pathology of inflammatory disorders and progression of several cancers, as well as being highly upregulated during viral infections of the lung. However, the exact role of CXCL17 in health and disease is largely unknown, mainly due to a lack of known molecular targets mediating CXCL17 functional responses. Using a range of bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) based assays, here we demonstrate that CXCL17 inhibits CXCR4-mediated signalling and ligand binding. Moreover, CXCL17 interacts with neuropillin-1, a VEGFR2 co-receptor. Additionally, we find CXCL17 only inhibits CXCR4 ligand binding in intact cells and demonstrate that this effect is mimicked by known glycosaminoglycan binders, surfen and protamine sulfate. This indicates that CXCL17 inhibits CXCR4 by a unique mechanism of action that potentially requires the presence of a glycosaminoglycan containing accessory protein. Altogether, our results reveal that CXCL17 is an endogenous inhibitor of CXCR4 and represents an important discovery in our understanding of the (patho) physiological functions of CXCL17 and regulation of CXCR4 signalling.","White, Carl W.; Kilpatrick, Laura E.; Dale, Natasha; Abhayawardana, Rekhati S.; Dekkers, Sebastian; Stocks, Michael J; Pfleger, Kevin D.

177631,What hurt and what helped: How one school's trauma-informed approach provided support during the pandemic,2021,"Interferons play a critical role in regulating host immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, but the interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene (ISG) effectors that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 are not well characterized. The IFN-inducible short isoform of human nuclear receptor coactivator 7 (NCOA7) inhibits endocytic virus entry, interacts with the vacuolar ATPase, and promotes endo-lysosomal vesicle acidification and lysosomal protease activity. Here, we used ectopic expression and gene knockout to demonstrate that NCOA7 inhibits infection by SARS-CoV-2 as well as by lentivirus particles pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-2 Spike in lung epithelial cells. Infection with the highly pathogenic, SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, or seasonal, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63, coronavirus Spike-pseudotyped viruses was also inhibited by NCOA7. Importantly, either overexpression of TMPRSS2, which promotes plasma membrane fusion versus endosomal fusion of SARS-CoV-2, or removal of Spike’s polybasic furin cleavage site rendered SARS-CoV-2 less sensitive to NCOA7 restriction. Collectively, our data indicate that furin cleavage sensitizes SARS-CoV-2 Spike to the antiviral consequences of endosomal acidification by NCOA7, and suggest that the acquisition of furin cleavage may have favoured the co-option of cell surface TMPRSS proteases as a strategy to evade the suppressive effects of IFN-induced endo-lysosomal dysregulation on virus infection.","Khan, H; Winstone, H; Jimenez-Guardeño, J; Graham, C; Doores, KJ; Goujon, C; Matthews, DA; Davidson, AD; Rihn, SJ; Palmarini, M; Neil, SJD; Malim, MH",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.23.453488,336
177748,The feelings & perceptions of a Medical doctor after recovery from Corona infection,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic situation has proved to be disastrous for humanity throughout the world. However, during this period, people must take precautions for safety purposes. One of the essential steps towards eliminating or reducing the effect of COVID-19 is maintaining social distancing while in public places. Some people are neglecting the social distancing norms while on the move. Still, no surveillance system exists, which monitors the people’s movement for social distancing and securely &efficiently shares the information with the concerned administration department. There also exists no penalty system which forces the people to ensure social distancing. Motivated from the aforementioned facts, in this paper, we present a blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI)-envisioned scheme for monitoring social distancing to combat COVID-19 situations. The proposed scheme uses fast region-based convolutional neural networks (RCNN) and you only look once (YOLO) models for the object (i.e., human) detection through the live video feed captured from the static CCTV cameras as well as lens-equipped drones. Further, the efficient euclidean distance calculation is embedded for calculating the distance between two humans. Blockchain technology ensures the secure and trusted exchange of information between the entities at the physical layer and the administration departments. Blockchain wallets are also used to pay the fine when people do not follow social distance norms. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated based on three broad parameters such as (i) human detection and violation identification, (ii) blockchain simulation and analysis, and (iii) network performance comparison. The parameters considered for (i) is confidence score, for (ii) are scalability, hash rate, and simulation interface, and for (iii) are network bandwidth, throughput, packet loss rate, and network latency. By analyzing all the parameters mentioned above, we observe the proposed scheme outperforms the traditional approaches. Author","Tanwar, S.; Gupta, R.; Patel, M.

As a result of the significant change in demand resulting from the economic environment, expectations and cyclicality caused by the pandemic, the assessment of organization performance has become subjective. Under these changed environmental conditions, most of the methods used by tourism companies to evaluate performance are not effective enough. In our research, we illustrated a controlling model based on fuzzy logic through a case study. By applying the model, it becomes possible to evaluate project-oriented tourism organizations according to different standardized norms. Our model considers the subjectivity derived from measurability and goal setting. We point out that the performance of organizations operating in the tourism industry significantly influenced by COVID-19 can be subjectively assessed during the pandemic period and thus depends on the analytical context. By evaluating the performance of tourism organizations along internal organizational goals, more relevant information content and more informed managerial decision support can be achieved.","Thalmeiner, Gergő Gáspár Sándor Barta Ákos Zéman Zoltán",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13179602,336

Their median age was 45 years; seven required hospitalization and one died. Most breakthrough infections (54/67) occurred with B.1.1.7 (Alpha) or B.1.526 (Iota). Among the 7 hospitalized cases, 5 were infected with B.1.1.7, including 1 death. Both unmatched and matched statistical analyses considering age, sex, vaccine type, and study month as covariates supported the null hypothesis of equal variant distributions between vaccinated and unvaccinated in chi-squared and McNemar tests (p>0.1) highlighting a high vaccine efficacy against B.1.1.7 and B.1.526. There was no clear association among breakthroughs between type of vaccine received and variant. In the vaccinated group, spike mutations in the N-terminal domain and receptor-binding domain that have been associated with immune evasion were overrepresented.

Using the social-mediated crisis communication model, the paper explores the key factors that influence public sentiments during nascent periods of the crisis. The choice of data collection dates was determined by key milestones events with significant implications in relation to UK tourism. Sentiment analysis of data sets of public tweets and news articles were done in order to interrogate how the trends and performance of the airlines and the tourism sector have been shaped by the sentiments of the tourism publics, the crisis communication interventions from key institutional actors, and the news sentiments about tourism organizations, particularly airlines. Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, falls under natural language processing (NLP) and is used to identify different sentiments and polarities in texts. Our findings indicate that institutional actors have a significant impact on the sentiments of tourism publics. Our study contributes to existing research on crisis communication by illuminating how public narrative about, and stakeholder responses to, crisis are shaped not just by organizational communication strategies but also institutional actors, on the one hand, and the interested publics too.","Obembe, Demola Kolade Dr Oluwaseun Obembe Dr Funmi Owoseni Dr Adebowale Mafimisebi Dr Oluwasoye",International Journal of Information Management Data Insights,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jjimei.2021.100040,336

While current employees have been subject to growing research from different perspectives, little is known about tourism students' (thus potentially future tourism employees) employability anxiety and how this can influence their well-being and attitudes toward their current academic majors. To fill this gap, this study proposes and assesses a conceptual model linking employability anxiety, psychological distress, perceived social support, and academic major satisfaction. Drawing on data collected from tour guiding students in Turkey, the results show that students' employability anxiety was significantly associated with increased psychological distress and decreased academic major satisfaction. The study findings fail to support the proposed moderating effect of perceived social support indicating that when anxious about their vocational future, tour guiding students' levels of psychological distress and academic major dissatisfaction are less likely to be mitigated by perceived social support.","Alrawadieh, D.

However, the participation of protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) in different exocytosis stages has not been defined. Here we demonstrated that PTP-MEG2 controls multiple steps of catecholamine secretion. Biochemical and crystallographic analyses revealed key residues that the interactions between govern the PTP-MEG2 and NSF-pY83 site, specify PTP-MEG2 substrate selectivity and modulate the fusion of catecholamine-containing vesicles. Unexpectedly, delineation of PTP-MEG2 mutants along with the NSF binding interface revealed that PTP-MEG2 controls the fusion pore opening through non-NSF dependent mechanisms. Utilizing bioinformatics search and biochemical and electrochemical screening approaches, we discovered that PTP-MEG2 regulates the opening and extension of the fusion pore by dephosphorylating the DYNAMIN2-pY125 and MUNC18-1-pY145 site. Further structural and biochemical analysis confirmed the interaction of PTP-MEG2 with MUNC18-1-pY145 or DYNAMIN2-pY125 through a distinct structural basis compared with that of the NSF-pY83 site.

A crystal structure of the PTP-MEG2/phosphor-NSF-pY83 segment was obtained. Functional delineation of the PTP-MEG2/NSF interface led to the discovery of new PTP-MEG2 substrates. PTP-MEG2 regulates fusion pore opening and extension through the DYNAMIN2-pY125 site and MUNC18-1 pY145 site. The distinct structural basis of the recognition of substrates by PTP-MEG2 allows selective inhibitor design.","Xu, Yun-Fei; Chen, Xu; Yang, Zhao; Xiao, Peng; Liu, Chun-Hua; Li, Kang-Shuai; Yang, Xiao-Zhen; Wang, Yi-Jing; Zhu, Zhong-Liang; Xu, Zhi-Gang; Zhang, Sheng; Wang, Chuan; Song, You-Chen; Zhao, Wei-Dong; Wang, Chang-He; Ji, Zhi-Liang; Zhang, Zhong-Yin; Cui, Min; Sun, Jin-Peng; Yu, Xiao",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/822031,336

This paper aims to assess the pandemic’s mobility impacts and whether these may have increased the already existing inequality between men and women. In particular, the variation of mode choice in a pre-COVID and post-COVID scenario is investigated, focusing on the use of transport mode defined as Smart Mobility. The analysis is performed on data collected in thirteen European countries between July and September 2020 through a survey designed using an intersectional approach. Responses are analyzed to highlight correlations between different factors affecting mobility changes: some interest is reserved to the modes used according to the journey scope (work, errand, shopping). Overall, results reveal more people walking for their daily journeys, while a significant decrease in the use of public transport is observed. Although these changes affect women more, the main reason behind this is the need for more safety in terms of low risk of contagion, irrespective of gender. A specific focus on using modes commonly associated with a Smart Mobility offer (such as shared modes, public transport, walking, and biking) reveals differences originating when comparing men and women responses and various age ranges. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Carboni, A.; Costa, M.; Kalakou, S.; Pirra, M.","3rd International Conference on HCI in Mobility, Transport, and Automotive Systems, MobiTAS 2021, held as part of the 23rd International Conference, HCI International 2020",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-78358-7_33,336

However, when conducting auditory experiments via online methods, the researcher has limited control over the participants’ listening environment. We offer a new method to probe one aspect of that environment, headphone use. Headphones not only provide better control of sound presentation but can also “shield” the listener from background noise. Here we present a rapid (< 3 minute) headphone screening test based on Huggins Pitch (HP), a perceptual phenomenon that can only be detected when stimuli are presented dichotically. We validate this test using a cohort of “Trusted” online participants who completed the test using both headphones and loudspeakers. The same participants were also used to test an existing headphone test (AP test; Woods et al., 2017, Attention Perception Psychophysics). We demonstrate that compared to the AP test, the HP test has a higher selectivity for headphone users, rendering it as a compelling alternative to existing methods. Overall, the new HP test correctly detects 80% of headphone users and has a false positive rate of 20%. Moreover, we demonstrate that combining the HP test with an additional test - either the AP test or an alternative based on a beat test (BT) - can lower the false positive rate to ∼7%. This should be useful in situations where headphone use is particularly critical (e.g. dichotic or spatial manipulations). Code for implementing the new tests is publicly available in JavaScript and through Gorilla (gorilla.sc).","Milne, Alice E.; Bianco, Roberta; Poole, Katarina C.; Zhao, Sijia; Oxenham, Andrew J.; Billig, Alexander J.; Chait, Maria",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.21.214395,336

The current study aims to verify that the global cruise tourism industry can be sustainable through its inherent power for long-term balanced convergence within the industry and can flexibly respond to external shocks such as COVID-19. This study applies the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) to estimate the long-term balance function that determines the number of world cruise tourists. This study reveals that the number of world cruise tourists finally converges to long-term balance if the number of world cruise tourists at present is lower than the one at long-term equilibrium. In summary, the results of the VECM in the present study suggest the presence of an “invisible hand” in the global cruise tourism industry converging to a long-term balance. A few previous studies have suggested ways to increase global cruise tourists and promote the cruise tourism industry through qualitative methods, however, little research has estimated the decision function of the number of cruise tourists at a long-term equilibrium point. This study shows the dynamic characteristics of the cruise tourism market using the VECM. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Ahn, Y. G.; Lee, M.

To this end, the theory of planned behavior was applied for predicting compliance with government-advised preventive measures. An attempt was made to examine how groups of people in terms of age, gender, educational level, income level, marital status, and health condition were observing the government-advised preventive measures. Methods: Totally, 5021 people above the age of 15 years responded to an online questionnaire that included items related to demographic features, compliance with COVID-19 preventive behavioral guidelines (home quarantine, avoiding social gathering, keeping physical distance of 1.5-2 meters, frequent hand sanitization, and avoiding shopping and outside recreation), TPB constructs (behavioral attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, intentions to do the preventive behavior), and risk perception. The study was descriptive and conducted in year 2020. Results: T-test, ANOVA, and correlations indicated that younger individuals, men, singles, people with lower educational levels, lower income level and no health condition reported lower compliance. Regression showed that intentions, perceived behavioral control, and subjective norm were associated with higher compliance. Furthermore, in regression, young age, male gender, and lower level of education were associated with lower compliance with C-19 PB. Conclusion: Young males with lower level of education infrequently comply with government-advised preventive measures.

186823,Benefits of Avoiding Unnecessary Medical Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2021-05-15,"Non-Invasive respiratory support can be viewed as mechanical respiratory support without endotracheal intubation and it includes Continuous Positive Airway Pressure, Bi-Level Positive Airway Pressure, High Flow Nasal Cannula, and Non-invasive Positive Pressure Ventilation. Over past few years, non-invasive respiratory support is getting more popular across pediatric intensive care units for acute respiratory failure as well as for long-term ventilation support at home. It reduces the need for invasive mechanical ventilation, decreases the risk of nosocomial pneumonia as well as mortality in selected pediatric and adult population. Unfortunately, majority of available studies on non-invasive respiratory support have been conducted in high-income countries, which are different from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) in terms of resources, man-power, and the disease profile. Hence, we need to consider disease profile, severity on admission to ICU or ward, availability of age-appropriate equipment, ability of health care professionals to manage patients on non-invasive respiratory support, and cost-benefit ratio. In view of the relatively high cost of equipment, there is a need to innovate to develop indigenous kits/ devices with available resources in LMICs to reduce the cost and potentially benefit health system. In this review, we highlight the role of non-invasive respiratory support in different clinical conditions, practical problems encountered in LMICs setting, and few indigenous techniques to provide non-invasive respiratory support.","Gulla, Krishna Mohan; Kabra, Sushil Kumar; Lodha, Rakesh",Indian pediatrics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33941707/,336

Each landscape and habitat has a kaleidoscope of niches supporting an enormous variety of vertebrate and invertebrate species, and each species or taxon supports an even more impressive array of macro- and micro-parasites. Infectious pathogens that originate in wild animals have become increasingly important throughout the world in recent decades, as they have had substantial impacts on human health, agricultural production, wildlife-based economies and wildlife conservation. The emergence of these pathogens as significant health issues is associated with a range of causal factors, most of them linked to the sharp and exponential rise of global human activity. Among these causal factors are the burgeoning human population, the increased frequency and speed of local and international travel, the increase in human-assisted movement of animals and animal products, changing agricultural practices that favour the transfer of pathogens between wild and domestic animals, and a range of environmental changes that alter the distribution of wild hosts and vectors and thus facilitate the transmission of infectious agents. Two different patterns of transmission of pathogens from wild animals to humans are evident among these emerging zoonotic diseases. In one pattern, actual transmission of the pathogen to humans is a rare event but, once it has occurred, human-to-human transmission maintains the infection for some period of time or permanently. Some examples of pathogens with this pattern of transmission are human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome, influenza A, Ebola virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome. In the second pattern, direct or vector-mediated animal-to-human transmission is the usual source of human infection. Wild animal populations are the principal reservoirs of the pathogen and human-to-human disease transmission is rare. Examples of pathogens with this pattern of transmission include rabies and other lyssaviruses, Nipah virus, West Nile virus, Hantavirus, and the agents of Lyme borreliosis, plague, tularemia, leptospirosis and ehrlichiosis. These zoonotic diseases from wild animal sources all have trends that are rising sharply upwards. In this paper, the authors discuss the causal factors associated with the emergence or re-emergence of these zoonoses, and highlight a selection to provide a composite view of their range, variety and origins. However, most of these diseases are covered in more detail in dedicated papers elsewhere in this Review.","Bengis, R G; Leighton, F A; Fischer, J R; Artois, M; Mörner, T; Tate, C M",Revue scientifique et technique,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15702716/,336

During the course of disease, pleural effusions and cavitation can also develop. Consolidation that involves > or = 4 zones on presentation or at day 7 after the onset of symptoms and subsequent development of acute respiratory distress syndrome are generally associated with an adverse outcome. Chest CT examinations performed during the convalescent period have demonstrated persistent ground glass attenuation and segmental consolidation.

Twelve CPN-CSS studies and six O-CSS studies were included. CPN-CSS typically obtained a single HScore value (e.g., aspartate transaminase > 30 U/L) while failing all other HScore criteria. A typical pattern for CPN-CSS was revealed when compared to O-CSS: lymphopenia vs. pancytopenia and increased vs. decreased fibrinogen. Findings, other than HScore commonly found in CPN-CSS studies, showed elevated lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, and C-reactive protein.

Increased awareness of recombination within the genus Norovirus of the family Calicivirus has led to a rise in the identification of norovirus (NoV) recombinants and they are now reported at high frequency. Currently, there is no classification system for recombinant NoVs and a widely accepted recombinant genotyping system is still needed. Consequently, there is duplication in reporting of novel recombinants. This has led to difficulties in defining the number and types of recombinants in circulation. In this study, 120 NoV nucleotide sequences were compiled from the current GenBank database and published literature. NoV recombinants and their recombination breakpoints were identified using three methods: phylogenetic analysis, SimPlot analysis and the maximum chi2 method. A total of 20 NoV recombinant types were identified in circulation worldwide. The recombination point is the ORF1/2 overlap in all isolates except one, which demonstrated a double recombination event within the polymerase region.","Bull, Rowena A; Tanaka, Mark M; White, Peter A",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18024905/,336

Five swine underwent surgical implantation of this circuit in the cervical vessels: one end in the common carotid artery and the other in the external jugular vein. Using this model, an aneurysm coiling procedure was simulated under fluoroscopic guidance, roadmapping and digital subtraction angiography. Creating an aneurysm model for training purposes by this method was technically simple and enabled the formation of a wide variety of aneurysms in a single procedure. The quality of the model was uniform and the model was reproducible. Coiling training using this model resembled a realistic clinical situation. The swine hybrid aneurysm-training model was advantageous from the standpoint of technical simplicity in the creation and variety of aneurysms it provided.

Several industrial L. lactis strains are sensitive to various distinct bacteriophages. Most of them belong to the Siphoviridae family and comprise several species, among which the 936 and P335 are prominent. Members of these two phage species recognize their hosts through the interaction of their receptor-binding protein (RBP) with external cell wall saccharidices of the host, the ""receptors."" We report here the 1.65 A resolution crystal structure of the RBP from phage TP901-1, a member of the P335 species. This RBP of 163 amino acids is a homotrimer comprising three domains: a helical N terminus, an interlaced beta-prism, and a beta-barrel, the head domain (residues 64-163), which binds a glycerol molecule. Fluorescence quenching experiments indicated that the RBP exhibits high affinity for glycerol, muramyl-dipeptide, and other saccharides in solution.

196152,House Calls: Providing Care Beyond the Office Walls.,2021,"Congenitally lymphopenic diabetes-prone (DP) BioBreeding (BB) rats develop spontaneous T cell-dependent autoimmunity. Coisogenic diabetes-resistant (DR) BB rats are not lymphopenic and are free of spontaneous autoimmune disease, but become diabetic in response to depletion of RT6+ T cells. The basis for the predisposition to autoimmunity in BB rats is unknown. Abnormal T cell development in DP-BB rats can be detected intrathymically, and thymocytes from DR-BB rats adoptively transfer diabetes. The mechanisms underlying these T cell developmental abnormalities are not known. To study these processes, we established adult thymus organ cultures (ATOC). We report that cultured DR- and DP-BB rat thymi generate mature CD4 and CD8 single-positive cells with up-regulated TCRs. DR-BB rat cultures also generate T cells that express RT6. In contrast, DP-BB rat cultures generate fewer CD4+, CD8+, and RT6+ T cells. Analysis of the cells obtained from ATOC suggested that the failure of cultured DP-BB rat thymi to generate T cells with a mature phenotype is due in part to an increased rate of apoptosis. Consistent with this inference, we observed that addition of the general caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK substantially increases the number of both mature and immature T cells produced by DP-BB rat ATOC. We conclude that cultured DR-BB and DP-BB rat thymi, respectively, recapitulate the normal and abnormal T cell developmental kinetics and phenotypes observed in these animals in vivo. Such cultures should facilitate identification of the underlying pathological processes that lead to immune dysfunction and autoimmunity in BB rats.","Whalen, B J; Weiser, P; Marounek, J; Rossini, A A; Mordes, J P; Greiner, D L",Journal of immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10201921/,336

The recombinant virus lacking the E gene (rSARS-CoV-DeltaE) was rescued in Vero E6 cells. The recovered deletion mutant grew in Vero E6, Huh-7, and CaCo-2 cells to titers 20-, 200-, and 200-fold lower than the recombinant wild-type virus, respectively, indicating that although the E protein has an effect on growth, it is not essential for virus replication. No differences in virion stability under a wide range of pH and temperature were detected between the deletion mutant and recombinant wild-type viruses. Although both viruses showed the same morphology by electron microscopy, the process of morphogenesis seemed to be less efficient with the defective virus than with the recombinant wild-type one. The rSARS-CoV-DeltaE virus replicated to titers 100- to 1,000-fold lower than the recombinant wild-type virus in the upper and lower respiratory tract of hamsters, and the lower viral load was accompanied by less inflammation in the lungs of hamsters infected with rSARS-CoV-DeltaE virus than with the recombinant wild-type virus. Therefore, the SARS-CoV that lacks the E gene is attenuated in hamsters, might be a safer research tool, and may be a good candidate for the development of a live attenuated SARS-CoV vaccine.","DeDiego, Marta L; Alvarez, Enrique; Almazán, Fernando; Rejas, María Teresa; Lamirande, Elaine; Roberts, Anjeanette; Shieh, Wun-Ju; Zaki, Sherif R; Subbarao, Kanta; Enjuanes, Luis",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17108030/,336

The study aimed to investigate the mechanisms of vasodilator action of the anaesthetic agents ketamine and propofol in diabetic rat aorta. 30 male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into two equal groups: (i) non-diabetic control (ii) Streptozotocin-induced diabetic group. DM was induced by a single intra-peritoneal injection of streptozotocin at 50 mg/kg body weight. Blood samples were taken from the tail vein after 24 hours and tested for glucose level using an automated glucose analyser. A blood glucose ≥10 mmol/L confirmed hyperglycaemia and the development of DM. Rats were sacrificed, and the aortae excised. The vascular responses of aortic rings from both groups to ketamine, propofol in the presence of vasoactive agents were studied using standard organ bath procedures. Ketamine and propofol reduced Phe-induced contraction similarly in the diabetic and control groups. Barium chloride, attenuated the relaxation response to propofol in diabetic aorta when compared to ketamine. 4-aminopyridine significantly attenuated the relaxation response to ketamine and propofol in diabetic aorta. Glibenclamide, significantly reduced ketamine-induced relaxation in diabetic aorta when compared to propofol. Activation of K+ channels with nicorandil or NS1619 did not affect the relaxation response to ketamine or propofol in diabetic aorta. The results recommend that propofol can be effective in mitigating the consequences of hemodynamic instability in glibenclamide treated diabetics when compared to ketamine. This response is mediated by propofol-induced inhibition of intracellular calcium influx.","Facey, Joan; Young, Lauriann; Nwokocha, Chukwuemeka",Nigerian journal of physiological sciences : official publication of the Physiological Society of Nigeria,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33084625/,336

Sample 1 participants had stronger fear related to infection than Sample 2 participants, who seemed to be concerned more about other health problems and discrimination. Participants with lower self-efficacy tended to have higher fear related to SARS. Fear related to SARS was also correlated positively with posttraumatic stress symptoms among respondents of Sample 2 (recovered staff). Interventions based on these findings are described.","Ho, Samuel M Y; Kwong-Lo, Rosalie S Y; Mak, Christine W Y; Wong, Joe S",Journal of consulting and clinical psychology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15796643/,336

Humans acquire this infection by ingestion of eggs of Echinococcus from infected dogs, sheep, goat, cattle or pigs. Hydatid cyst causes significant morbidity, mortality and socioeconomic loss. Objective The objective of this study was to describe the clinical profile and short-term outcome of surgical treatment of hydatidosis at Bhutan's largest hospital. Method This was a descriptive study conducted among patients ≥ 18 years at the National Referral Hospital, Thimphu, Bhutan from 01 January to 31 December 2017. Data on pre-surgery treatment, type and outcome of surgery and histopathology were collected. Data was entered analysed in EpiData. All variables are presented using descriptive statistics. Ethics approval was obtained from the Research Ethics Board of Health, Ministry of Health, Bhutan. Result There were 38 patients who underwent surgeries. The mean age of the sample was 36 (±17) years; cases were reported from almost all districts in the country. The most common symptoms at presentation was abdominal pain (27, 71.4%), nausea (21, 55.3%), abdominal distension (16, 41.1%). The median duration of symptoms was 6.0 months (IQR 3.0, 12.0). Liver was involved in 36 patients (94.7%). All underwent de-roofing and drainage through laparotomy (35; 92.1%), laparoscopy (2, 5.3%) or throracotomy (1, 2.6%). Histopathologic confirmation was obtained in 28 patients (73.7%). Twenty-three patients (60.5%) suffered from minor post-operative complications. Conclusion Patients with hydatid cyst present with abdominal pain, nausea abdominal distension. They suffer with symptoms for long periods till surgical treatment. The majority had favourable outcomes of surgery.","Kelzang, S; Dorji, T; Tenzin, T",Kathmandu University medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33305741/,336

Owing to the fact that isolation centre, in general, always contained a constant number of 200 COVID-19 patients, the prime objective of the study was to check if several drains carrying RNA of coronavirus are actually getting diluted or accumulated along with the sewage network. Our finding suggested that while the temporal variation of the genetic load decreased in small drains over the span of 50 days, the main sewer exhibited accumulation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Other interesting finding displays that probably distance of sampling location in meters is not likely to have a significant impact on the detected gene concentration, although the quantity of the RNA extracted in the downstream of the drain was higher. These findings are of immense value from the perspective of wastewater surveillance of COVID-19, as they largely imply that we do not need to monitor every wastewater system, and probably major drains monitoring may illustrate the city health. Perhaps, we are reporting the accumulation of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material along with the sewer network i.e. from primary to tertiary drains. The study sought further data collection in this line to simulate conditions prevailed in most of the developing countries and to shed further light on decay/accumulation processes of the genetic load of the SARS-COV-2.","Ahmed, Firoz; Islam, Md Aminul; Kumar, Manish; Hossain, Maqsud; Bhattacharya, Prosun; Islam, Md Tahmidul; Hossen, Foysal; Hossain, Md Shahadat; Islam, Md Sydul; Uddin, Md Main; Islam, Md Nur; Bahadur, Newaz Mohammed; Didar-Ul-Alam, Md; Reza, Hasan Mahmud; Jakariya, Md",Sci Total Environ,,336

Objetivo: Examinar los factores que influyen en la salud mental de la población infantojuvenil durante la pandemia del COVID-19. Métodos: Se realizó la revisión bibliográfica entre mayo y agosto de 2020 utilizando como fuentes de información la literatura publicada en las bases de datos de Pubmed/Medline, Science Direct, SciELO, Cumed, Lilacs. Se utilizaron las palabras clave: COVID-19, cuarentena, confinamiento, distanciamiento social, salud mental, trastornos mentales, trastornos psiquiátricos, infancia, adolescencia. Resultados: Se consideraron temáticas como estrés, afectación física, distanciamiento y aislamiento social, experiencias adversas, resiliencia, salud mental, impacto psicológico, maltrato infantil, y familia. Las experiencias adversas vividas durante las etapas de desarrollo ocupan un lugar crítico en la conformación de la salud mental. Consideraciones finales: La salud mental de la población infantojuvenil puede afectarse por las consecuencias adversas de la pandemia de la COVID-19 y estar la persona en pleno desarrollo psicológico. No todas las respuestas psicológicas podrán calificarse como enfermedades, porque la mayoría son reacciones normales ante una situación anormal. El factor protector por excelencia de los infantes y adolescentes es la familia con la presencia de adultos responsables y estables que puedan ofrecer el apoyo necesario, establecer rutinas y hábitos saludables, y promover la resiliencia.","Galiano Ramírez, María de la Concepción; Prado Rodríguez, Ramón Felipe; Mustelier Bécquer, Reinaldo Gaspar",Rev. cuba. pediatr,,336

We reviewed two pediatric patients with moderate COVID-19, collected the epidemiologic information and monitored the cycle threshold value of rectal specimen and the viral loads, and discussed the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in pediatric patients and the virulence of feces in children with moderate COVID-19, in order to analyze the risk of kindergartens reopening.","Dong, Qiao-Qiao; Qiu, Li-Ru; Cheng, Li-Ming; Shu, Sai-Nan; Chen, Yu; Zhao, Yue; Hao, Yan; Shi, Huan; Luo, Xiao-Ping",Curr Med Sci,,336
204286,Adolescent drug use before and during U.S. national COVID-19 social distancing policies,2021,"We report on the results of a measurement study carried out on a commuter bus in Dublin, Ireland using the Google/Apple Exposure Notification (GAEN) API. This API is likely to be widely used by Covid-19 contact tracing apps. Measurements were collected between 60 pairs of Android handset locations and are publicly available. We find that the attenuation level reported by the GAEN API need not increase with distance between handsets, consistent with there being a complex radio environment inside a bus caused by the metal-rich environment. Changing the people sitting in a pair of seats can cause variations of ±10dB in the attenuation level reported by the GAEN API. Applying the rule used by the Swiss Covid-19 contact tracing app to trigger an exposure notification to our bus measurements we find that no exposure notifications would have been triggered despite the fact that all pairs of handsets were within 2m of one another for at least 15 mins. Applying an alternative threshold-based exposure notification rule can somewhat improve performance to a detection rate of 5% when an exposure duration threshold of 15 minutes is used, increasing to 8% when the exposure duration threshold is reduced to 10 mins. Stratifying the data by distance between pairs of handsets indicates that there is only a weak dependence of detection rate on distance.","Leith, Douglas J; Farrell, Stephen",PLoS One,,336

206217,Orthopaedic Education During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"The communication in quarantined areas, e.g., due to the new COVID-19 pandemic, between isolated areas and in areas with technical damage has resulted in a great deal of interest concerning the safety of the population. A new method for ensuring communication between different areas, using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks with a well-established mobility schedule is proposed. UAVs fly based on a mission plan using regular polygons covering an area from a map. The area is considered to be equidistantly covered with points, grouped in triangles which are further grouped into hexagons. In this paper, UAVs, including battery charging or battery swapping stations and light weight Wi-Fi boards, are used for the data transfer among drones and stations using delivery protocols. UAV network analysis and evaluation (lengths of the arcs in seconds) based on experimental preliminary flight tests are proposed. Multiple simulations are performed based on six DTN algorithms, single-copy, and multiple-copies algorithms, and the efficiency of data transmission (delivery rate and latency) is analyzed. A very good delivery rate of 0.973 is obtained using the newly introduced TD-UAV Dijkstra algorithm.","Udroiu, Razvan; Deaconu, Adrian Marius; Nanau, Corina-Stefania",Sensors (Basel),,336

Currently, the absence of intensification of millet farming, lack of deployment of genetic tools for trait improvement, and the need for optimization of storage and supply chains limit crop production. We highlight a roadmap to strengthen small millet cultivation, such as identifying varieties suitable for particular environments and targeting trait improvement using genetic and genomic approaches. These approaches will help to combat hunger and malnutrition and also economically benefit the farmers and stakeholders involved in small millet cultivation amidst the ongoing pandemic.","Muthamilarasan, Mehanathan; Prasad, Manoj",Trends plant sci,,336

From the preliminary descriptive analysis, it shows that environmental factor such as UV (ultraviolet) is one of the essential factors that should be considered to observe the COVID-19 epidemic drivers. Moreover, there are education, government, morphological, health, economic, and behavioral factors contributing to the growth of COVID-19. Besides descriptive analysis, in this research, multivariate analysis is considered to provide comprehensive explanations about factors contributing to pandemic dynamics. To achieve rich explanations, visual attribution of explainable Convolution-LSTM is utilized to see high contributing factors responsible for the growth of daily COVID-19 cases. Our model consists of 1 D CNN in the first layer to capture local relationships among variables followed by LSTM layers to capture local dependencies over time. It produces the lowest prediction errors compared to the other existing models. This permits us to employ gradient-based visual attribution for generating saliency maps for each time dimension and variable. These are then used for explaining which variables throughout which period of the interval is contributing for a given time-series prediction, likewise as explaining that during that time intervals were the joint contribution of most vital variables for that prediction. The explanations are useful for stakeholders to make decisions during and post pandemics.

In this study, we coupled online solid-phase extraction with liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry to achieve high-throughput analysis of health and lifestyle-related substances in untreated municipal wastewater during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Twenty-six substances were identified and quantified in influent samples collected from six wastewater treatment plants during the COVID-19 pandemic in central New York. Over a 12 week sampling period, the mean summed consumption rate of six major substance groups (i.e., antidepressants, antiepileptics, antihistamines, antihypertensives, synthetic opioids, and central nervous system stimulants) correlated with disparities in household income, marital status, and age of the contributing populations as well as the detection frequency of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA in wastewater and the COVID-19 test positivity in the studied sewersheds. Nontarget screening revealed the covariation of piperine, a nontarget substance, with SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater collected from one of the sewersheds.

209724,Nutritional Status of COVID 19 Patients: Possible Impact on Mental Health Status,2021,"Objective To teach learners to identify and recognize structural causes of health disparities, design interventions, and engage in equitable, civil, and compassionate discussions. Background The racial injustices amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic have stressed the importance of educating healthcare practitioners to be advocates for social justice. Structural competency provides a framework for teaching students to be aware of structural causes of health disparities and design interventions to address them. We designed and implemented a ten-week Health Equity curriculum to promote structural competency and reduce implicit bias in healthcare providers. Here, we report on the design, implementation, student performance and student attitudes regarding this curriculum. Methods The Health Equity curriculum was a mandatory component of the Neuropsychiatric Theme for second year Pharmacy students. Students were assigned to subgroups of 5-6 and were distributed across self-identified gender and ethnicity. The curriculum was conducted remotely and consisted of didactic material, asynchronous online discussions, and synchronous Zoom discussions. Didactic material included videos, podcasts, journal articles, and faculty-created lectures. Asynchronous discussions were structured around the didactic content and open-ended prompts were provided to stimulate conversation. Three live discussions provided students with space to discuss the topics in real time. Four main topics were covered: (1) cultural and structural influences on mental health, (2) mental health and LGBTQ populations, (3) homelessness, deinstitutionalization and the mental health system, and (4) a student-identified topic. A survey was administered before and after the curriculum, and topics were assessed in OSCE (Objective Structured Clinical Examination). Results Student responses from pre- and post-surveys will be compared and quantitatively analyzed. A thematic qualitative analysis of student responses to open-ended questions will be conducted and compared. OSCE performance will be assessed for application of what was learned. Conclusion Given the challenges of integrating health disparities education into already impacted curricula, we believe our curriculum presents a rich learning experience with minimal in-class time and has potential for wide dissemination across health professional schools, with the opportunity for interprofessional collaboration. This curriculum has gone through one iteration with one cohort of students. However, given its innovative nature, we will gain insights into student engagement and performance in an online Health Equity curriculum.","Tuan, Rupa Hsia Stephanie",The FASEB Journal,,336

A 54-year-old man diagnosed with COVID-19 was hospitalized in the intensive care unit. The patient's O2 saturation was 80% using an oxygen mask, which was gradually declining. After 4 sessions of HP/continuous renal replacement therapies (CRRT), O2 saturation reached to 95%, and the patient was transferred to the general ward. Performing HP/CRRT at the early stages of ARDS can obviate the need for intubating patients with COVID-19. Punctual and early use of HP and CRRT in the treatment of ARDS in patients with COVID-19 prevented the progression of ARDS and patient intubation, reduced respiratory distress and the patient's dependence on oxygen, prevented other complications such as AKI and septic shock in the patient, and reduced mortality and hospital length of stay.","Esmaeili Vardanjani, Ali; Ronco, Claudio; Rafiei, Hossein; Golitaleb, Mohamad; Pishvaei, Mohammad Hoseyn; Mohammadi, Mostafa",Blood Purif,,336

213063,The psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Dutch people with and without an inflammatory rheumatic disease,2020,"Severe COVID-19 can manifest as multiorgan dysfunction with pulmonary involvement being the most common and prominent. As more reports emerge in the literature, it appears that an exaggerated immune response in the form of unfettered complement activation and a cytokine storm may be a key driver of the widespread organ injury seen in this disease. In addition, these patients are also known to be hypercoagulable with a high rate of thrombosis and a higher-than-expected failure rate of anticoagulation. While macrovascular thrombosis is common in these individuals, the frequent finding of extensive microvascular thromboses in several series and case reports, raises the possibility of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) as being a contributing factor in the thrombotic and multi-organ complications of the disease. If this is correct, rapidly identifying a TMA and treating the underlying pathophysiology may allow for better outcomes in these critically ill patients. To further explore this, we reviewed the published literature on COVID-19, looking for reports describing TMA-like presentations. We summarize our findings here along with a discussion about presentation, pathophysiology, and a suggested treatment algorithm.","Tiwari, Nishant R; Phatak, Sanat; Sharma, Vivek R; Agarwal, Sanjay K",Thromb Res,,336
213082,Health Tips to Prevent the Spread of COVID-19 to Nursing Homes,2021,"The Indo-Pacific, combines a panoply of regions and blends multiple security architectures. Some regions are dominated by non-traditional security threats, while others are unstable and rife with security dilemma. Instability and disorder are most palpable in the maritime domain, especially in the geographical region of the western Pacific. From the beginning of 2020, China has intensified its assertiveness in the South China Sea, including the announcement of two administrative districts and transgressions by its survey ship Haiyang Dizhi 8. Some attribute these developments to the COVID-19 outbreak. Enhanced US posture in the region seems to have little effect on Chinese revanchism. This article assesses the spurt of developments in the South China Sea during the COVID-19 pandemic. It establishes the conceptual framework for analysing the change in the regional order. It evaluates the regional security architecture of the western Pacific and the efficacy of the putative order. The prospective change in the security order of the western Pacific and response is also examined.","Banerjee, Somen",Marit. Aff.,,336
213220,Smartphone-Based Self-Testing of COVID-19 Using Breathing Sounds,2020,"To safely resume sports, college and university athletic programs and regional athletic conferences created plans to mitigate transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Mitigation measures included physical distancing, universal masking, and maximizing outdoor activity during training; routine testing; 10-day isolation of persons with COVID-19; and 14-day quarantine of athletes identified as close contacts* of persons with confirmed COVID-19. Regional athletic conferences created testing and quarantine policies based on National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) guidance (1); testing policies varied by conference, school, and sport. To improve compliance with quarantine and reduce the personal and economic burden of quarantine adherence, the quarantine period has been reduced in several countries from 14 days to as few as 5 days with testing (2) or 10 days without testing (3). Data on quarantined athletes participating in NCAA sports were used to characterize COVID-19 exposures and assess the amount of time between quarantine start and first positive SARS-CoV-2 test result. Despite the potential risk for transmission from frequent, close contact associated with athletic activities (4), more athletes reported exposure to COVID-19 at social gatherings (40.7%) and from roommates (31.7%) than they did from exposures associated with athletic activities (12.7%). Among 1,830 quarantined athletes, 458 (25%) received positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results during the 14-day quarantine, with a mean of 3.8 days from quarantine start (range = 0-14 days) until the positive test result. Among athletes who had not received a positive test result by quarantine day 5, the probability of having a positive test result decreased from 27% after day 5 to <5% after day 10. These findings support new guidance from CDC (5) in which different options are provided to shorten quarantine for persons such as collegiate athletes, especially if doing so will increase compliance, balancing the reduced duration of quarantine against a small but nonzero risk for postquarantine transmission. Improved adherence to mitigation measures (e.g., universal masking, physical distancing, and hand hygiene) at all times could further reduce exposures to SARS-CoV-2 and disruptions to athletic activities because of infections and quarantine (1,6).","Atherstone, Christine; Peterson, Meaghan L; Malone, Mackenzie; Honein, Margaret A; MacNeil, Adam; O039,; Neal, Catherine S; Paul, Stephen; Harmon, Kimberly G; Goerl, Kyle; Wolfe, Cameron R; Casani, Julie; Barrios, Lisa C",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,336

Key informants were asked about the community's experiences with COVID-19 testing and treatment, responses to CDC (Centers for Disease Control) guidelines, perceptions about the virus, and the pandemic's impact on physical and mental health. Results suggest that COVID-19 has profoundly impacted Brazilian immigrants' mental and physical health. Key informants perceived that community members faced higher risk of COVID-19 infection due to overcrowded living conditions and over-representation in public-facing and informal (e.g., housecleaning) jobs. They reported barriers to COVID-19-related healthcare services including language, immigration status, and fear of deportation. Brazilian cultural norms surrounding hygiene practices, social distancing, and information distribution have shaped the community's pandemic response. The Brazilian community has faced extensive social, economic, and health ramifications due to the pandemic. While not unique to this community, pre-existing concerns about social disadvantage suggest a particular vulnerability of this population to the virus.","Priebe Rocha, Leticia; Rose, Rebecca; Hoch, Annmarie; Soares, Cristiane; Fernandes, Adriana; Galvão, Heloisa; Allen, Jennifer D",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,336

Risk factors, histopathological characterization, pathophysiology, prevalence, and management of post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis are poorly understood, and few studies have addressed these issues.Areas covered:This article reviews the current evidence regarding post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis, with an emphasis on the potential risk factors, histopathology, pathophysiology, functional and tomographic features, and potential therapeutic modalities. A search on the issue was performed in the MEDLINE, Embase, and SciELO databases and the Cochrane library between 1 December 2019, and 25 January 2021. Studies were reviewed and relevant topics were incorporated into this narrative review. Expert opinion: Pulmonary sequelae may occur secondary to COVID-19, which needs to be included as a potential etiology in the current differential diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis. Therefore, serial clinical, tomographic, and functional screening for pulmonary fibrosis is recommended after COVID-19, mainly in patients with pulmonary involvement in the acute phase of the disease. Further studies are necessary to determine the risk factors, markers, pathophysiology, and appropriate management of post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis.","Tanni, Suzana Erico; Fabro, Alexandre Todorovic; de Albuquerque, André; Ferreira, Eloara Vieira Machado; Verrastro, Carlos Gustavo Yuji; Sawamura, Márcio Valente Yamada; Ribeiro, Sergio Marrone; Baldi, Bruno Guedes",Expert Rev Respir Med,,336

214846,Avoiding a legacy of unequal non-communicable disease burden after the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"INTRODUCTION: There is worldwide concern over the psycho-emotional impact of COVID-19 on healthcare workers (HCWs). This study aimed to elicit HCWs' perceptions of the adequacy of protective measures in high-risk clinical areas and the factors associated with these perceptions. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study conducted in April 2020. An anonymous electronic survey was sent via email to operating theatre (OT) and intensive care unit (ICU) staff of Sengkang General Hospital, Singapore. RESULTS: Of the 358 eligible participants, 292 (81.6%) responded to the survey. 93.2% of the participants felt that precautionary measures at work were sufficient and 94.9% acknowledged that adequate training was provided. More than 60% of the participants opined that their chances of contracting COVID-19 were moderate to high. Female gender, nursing occupation and duration of service < 10 years were significantly associated with increased fear of contracting COVID-19, less control over occupational exposure and lower perceived need to care for COVID-19 patients. Having young children at home did not significantly affect these perceptions. The most important ICU precautions were availability of personal protective equipment outside the rooms of COVID-19 positive patients (95.3%) and having visitor restrictions (95.3%). The most important OT measures were having a dedicated OT for COVID-19 positive patients (91.2%) and having simulation as part of protocol familiarisation (91.7%). CONCLUSION: Overall, there was high confidence in the adequacy of COVID-19 protective measures to prevent healthcare transmission in Singapore. The pandemic had a lower degree of psycho-emotional impact on HCWs here as compared to other countries.","Au-Yong, Phui-Sze Angie; Peh, Wee-Ming; Koh, Frederick Hong-Xiang; Teo, Li-Ming; Ng, Siok-Peng; Tan, Alina Li-Na; Ng, Aven Shan-Hua; Chew, Min-Hoe",Singap. med. j,,336
215228,"Corrigendum to ""Emergency Medical Services resource capacity and competency amid COVID-19 in the United States: preliminary findings from a national survey""",2020,"Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) among adolescents is a major health concern globally. The epidemiology and determinant of NSSI have not been studied extensively in Iran. Thus, this longitudinal study sought to investigate the prevalence, incidence and contributing factors of NSSI among adolescents in Iran. This study was conducted at high school students aged 14-18 years old in the metropolitan city of Tabriz, located in north western Iran. Data were collected from 6229 10th-grade students at two time-points, with 12 months interval in October and November 2017 and 2018. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect information on demographic, NSSI and cigarette and hookah smoking from the study participants. The results showed that lifetime prevalence of NSSI among students was 6.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.7 to 6.9) at the first assessment. Scratching and hair pulling were the most and least common methods of self-injury, respectively. Over the one year, 206 students (3.6% CI 95%: 3.1-4.1) reported the onset of NSSI. Tobacco smoking and previous year average grade were related to the incidence of NSSI. Although gender was significantly associated with the prevalence of NSSI, the relationship between gender and incidence of NSSI was not significant. Although the prevalence of NSSI was low among adolescents, the incidence rate was considerable. Further studies are required to understand the risk factors of NSSI in Iran.","Marin, Soudabeh; Hajizadeh, Mohammad; Sahebihagh, Mohammad Hassan; Nemati, Hossein; Ataeiasl, Maryam; Anbarlouei, Masoumeh; Pashapour, Hadi; Mahmoodi, Mahbobeh; Mohammadpoorasl, Asghar",Psychiatr. q,,336

(Special Issue: Safety & COVID-19.),2021,"BACKGROUND: Current intensive care unit (ICU) sedation guidelines recommend strategies using non-benzodiazepine sedatives. This survey was undertaken to explore inhaled ICU sedation practice in France. METHODS: In this national survey, medical directors of French adult ICUs were contacted by phone or email between July and August 2019. ICU medical directors were questioned about the characteristics of their department, their knowledge on inhaled sedation, and practical aspects of inhaled sedation use in their department. RESULTS: Among the 374 ICUs contacted, 187 provided responses (50%). Most ICU directors (73%) knew about the use of inhaled ICU sedation and 21% used inhaled sedation in their unit, mostly with the Anaesthetic Conserving Device (AnaConDa, Sedana Medical). Most respondents had used volatile agents for sedation for <5 years (63%) and in <20 patients per year (75%), with their main indications being: failure of intravenous sedation, severe asthma or bronchial obstruction, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Sevoflurane and isoflurane were mainly used (88% and 20%, respectively). The main reasons for not using inhaled ICU sedation were: ""device not available"" (40%), ""lack of medical interest"" (37%), ""lack of familiarity or knowledge about the technique"" (35%) and ""elevated cost"" (21%). Most respondents (80%) were overall satisfied with the use of inhaled sedation. Almost 75% stated that inhaled sedation was a seducing alternative to intravenous sedation. CONCLUSION: This survey highlights the widespread knowledge about inhaled ICU sedation in France but shows its limited use to date. Differences in education and knowledge, as well as the recent and relatively scarce literature on the use of volatile agents in the ICU, might explain the diverse practices that were observed. The low rate of mild adverse effects, as perceived by respondents, and the users' satisfaction, are promising for this potentially important tool for ICU sedation.","Blondonnet, Raiko; Quinson, Audrey; Lambert, Céline; Audard, Jules; Godet, Thomas; Zhai, Ruoyang; Pereira, Bruno; Futier, Emmanuel; Bazin, Jean-Etienne; Constantin, Jean-Michel; Jabaudon, Matthieu",PLoS One,,336

(Special Issue: Safety & COVID-19.),2021,"OBJECTIVES: To understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on parental perceptions of health behaviors and food insecurity among children with overweight and obesity living in San Francisco and to assess the relationship between food insecurity and dietary intake during the pandemic. METHODS: Parents of children ages 4-12 in San Francisco with BMI≥85th percentile measured at a clinic visit at an FQHC or academic practice from January 1(st) to March 15(th), 2020 were eligible to participate. Parents completed a survey reporting on child health behaviors and household food insecurity prior to and since the start of the pandemic. Survey items were abstracted from validated surveys with adaptations. Regression models evaluated associations between food insecurity and dietary intake variables. RESULTS: Most participants (n=145) were publicly insured (90%), Latino (77%), and spoke Spanish at home (70%). Parents perceived that child mean daily non-academic screen time was higher during the pandemic compared to before (3.8 hours vs 1.6 hours). Mean daily physical activity was reported to be lower compared to prior to the pandemic (1 hour vs 1.8 hours). On average, reported bedtime shifted 1.6 hours later. Food insecurity increased significantly, but was not associated with intake of fruits, vegetables, sugar-sweetened beverages, or foods with added sugar during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Parents of children with overweight or obesity in San Francisco perceive increased child screen time, decreased physical activity and later bedtimes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings suggest a need for policies that support healthy lifestyle behaviors among low-income children during the pandemic.","Beck, A. L.; Huang, J.

217891,Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Short-Term Course of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder,2021,"This study examined the associations of perceived social capital and income change since the outbreak with probable depression and preventive behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong. Random digit dialing recruited a population-representative sample of 3011 Hong Kong Chinese aged &#8805; 15 years (mean = 44, 55% females) between February 25 and April 29 2020. Respondents reported social capital (perceived interpersonal trust, social harmony, and sense of belonging), income change since the outbreak (loss vs. gain/no change), depressive symptoms, preventive behaviors, and demographics. Controlling for sociodemographics, lack of perceived interpersonal trust was associated with probable depression and avoiding contact with people with respiratory symptoms. Lack of perceived sense of belonging was associated with probable depression and decreased odds of adopting preventive behaviors. Lack of perceived social harmony was associated with probable depression and increased odds of used face masks among respondents with income loss only. Our results suggest that social capital is related to lower risk of depression and to higher chance of used face masks particularly among those experiencing income loss related to COVID-19. Prevention of mental health problems and promotion of effective preventive behaviors could be implemented by focusing on support for those who are socioeconomically disadvantaged.","Li, Tsz Wai; Lee, Tatia Mei-Chun; Goodwin, Robin; Ben-Ezra, Menachem; Liang, Li; Liu, Huinan; Hou, Wai Kai",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,336

Methods: One week after the lockdown was announced, we conducted an anonymous online survey of the orthopaedic surgeons in India through social media platforms to assess the impact of the lockdown during COVID 19. The survey had a total of 13 questions with (3-5) options and was designed with an aim to understand the perception and the state of mind of the Orthopaedic surgeons in the lockdown situation. Results: The survey was completed by 611 orthopaedic surgeons from 140 cities in India. There were 22.5% orthopaedic surgeons who said that they were definitely stressed out, and 40.5% who said they were mildly stressed out. As the age decreased, the percentage of orthopaedic surgeons feeling ""definitely stressed out"" increased. Disruption of life-work balance and uncertainties regarding return to work were other strongly associated factors with the ""definitely stressed out"" group. Conclusion: The psychological impact of the lockdown during COVID 19 on orthopaedic surgeons may become a potential concern that will require addressal through open discussion.

Over the following months, the virus rapidly spread throughout the world. Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) can involve the gastrointestinal tract, including symptoms like nausea, vomiting and diarrhea and shedding of the SARS-CoV-2 in feces. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein, which has been proven to be a cell receptor for SARS-CoV-2, is expressed in the glandular cells of gastric, duodenal, and rectal epithelia, supporting the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the host cells. According to the literature, rates of COVID-19 patients reporting diarrhea were between 7 - 14%. Diarrhea in the course of COVID-19 disease can cause dehydration and hospitalization. Although no antiviral drug was specifically designed for the treatment of diarrhea, several molecules could have beneficial effects by reducing viral replication. In this letter, we discussed the Levamisole, which is an anthelmintic agent with immunomodulatory effects, could be used effectively both for antiviral therapy and especially in COVID-19 patients with diarrhea.","Uyaroglu, Oguz Abdullah; Güven, Gülay Sain; Güllü, Ibrahim",J Infect Dev Ctries,,336

This study investigated whether there is an association between their prescription and the incidence of COVID-19 and all-cause mortality. METHODS: We conducted a propensity-score matched cohort study comparing the incidence of COVID-19 among patients with hypertension prescribed angiotensin-converting enzyme I (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II type-1 receptor blockers (ARBs) to those treated with calcium channel blockers (CCBs) in a large UK-based primary care database (The Health Improvement Network). We estimated crude incidence rates for confirmed/suspected COVID-19 in each drug exposure group. We used Cox proportional hazards models to produce adjusted hazard ratios for COVID-19. We assessed all-cause mortality as a secondary outcome. RESULTS: The incidence rate of COVID-19 among users of ACE inhibitors and CCBs was 9.3 per 1000 person-years (83 of 18,895 users [0.44%]) and 9.5 per 1000 person-years (85 of 18,895 [0.45%]), respectively. The adjusted hazard ratio was 0.92 (95% CI 0.68 to 1.26). The incidence rate among users of ARBs was 15.8 per 1000 person-years (79 out of 10,623 users [0.74%]). The adjusted hazard ratio was 1.38 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.95). There were no significant associations between use of RAS inhibitors and all-cause mortality. CONCLUSION: Use of ACE inhibitors was not associated with the risk of COVID-19 whereas use of ARBs was associated with a statistically non-significant increase compared to the use of CCBs. However, no significant associations were observed between prescription of either ACE inhibitors or ARBs and all-cause mortality.","Haroon, Shamil; Subramanian, Anuradhaa; Cooper, Jennifer; Anand, Astha; Gokhale, Krishna; Byne, Nathan; Dhalla, Samir; Acosta-Mena, Dionisio; Taverner, Thomas; Okoth, Kelvin; Wang, Jingya; Chandan, Joht Singh; Sainsbury, Christopher; Zemedikun, Dawit Tefra; Thomas, G Neil; Parekh, Dhruv; Marshall, Tom; Sapey, Elizabeth; Adderley, Nicola J; Nirantharakumar, Krishnarajah",BMC Infect Dis,,336
220045,The dilemma of masks during the COVID-19 outbreak,2021,"The main route of transmission of the human coronaviruses (HCoVs), and presumably also of the new pandemic SARS-CoV-2, is via droplets and close contacts, however their fecal elimination also suggests the possible spread via water. A scientific literature search was thus carried out to highlight the current state of the art and knowledge gaps regarding coronavirus in water. Since 1978 only 22 studies have met the inclusion criteria, and considered heterogeneous purposes, detection methods and types of water. In vitro experiments have addressed the recovery efficiency of analytical methods, survival in different types of water and the removal efficiency of water treatments. Field studies have monitored coronaviruses in surface waters, sewage, slurry, and biosolids. Overall, at the lab scale, HCoVs or surrogates can survive for several days at 4 °C, however their persistence is lower compared with non-enveloped viruses and is strongly influenced by temperature and organic or microbial pollution. HCoVs have rarely been detected in field investigations, however may be due to the low recovery efficiency of the analytical methods. The scarcity of information on HCoV in the environment suggests that research is needed to understand the fate of these viruses in the water cycle.","Carducci, Annalaura; Federigi, Ileana; Liu, Dasheng; Thompson, Julian R; Verani, Marco",Water Res,,336

222130,Cognitive Reappraisal and the Association Between Perceived Stress and Anxiety Symptoms in COVID-19 Isolated People,2020,"The chest computed tomography (CT) characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are important for diagnostic and prognostic purposes. The aim of this study was to investigate chest CT findings in COVID-19 patients in order to determine the optimal cut-off value of a CT severity score that can be considered a potential prognostic indicator of a severe/critical outcome.The CT findings were evaluated by means of a severity score that included the extent (0-4 grading scale) and nature (0-4 grading scale) of CT abnormalities. The images were evaluated at 3 levels bilaterally. A receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve was used to identify the optimal score (Youden's index) predicting severe/critical COVID-19.The study involved 165 COVID-19 patients (131 men [79.4%] and 34 women [20.6%] with a mean age of 61.5â±â12.5 years), of whom 30 (18.2%) had severe/critical disease and 135 (81.8%) mild/typical disease. The most frequent CT finding was bilateral predominantly subpleural and basilar airspace changes, with more extensive ground-glass opacities than consolidation. CT findings of consolidation, a crazy-paving pattern, linear opacities, air bronchogram, and extrapulmonary lesions correlated with severe/critical COVID-19. The mean CT severity score was 63.95 in the severe/critical group, and 35.62 in the mild/typical group (Pâ<â.001). ROC curve analysis showed that a CT severity score of 38 predicted the development of severe/critical symptoms.A CT severity score can help the risk stratification of COVID-19 patients.","Salaffi, Fausto; Carotti, Marina; Tardella, Marika; Borgheresi, Alessandra; Agostini, Andrea; Minorati, Davide; Marotto, Daniela; Di Carlo, Marco; Galli, Massimo; Giovagnoni, Andrea; Sarzi-Puttini, Piercarlo",Medicine (Baltimore),,336
222309,No Evidence for a Decrease in Physical Activity Among Swiss Office Workers During COVID-19: A Longitudinal Study,2021,"Towards the improvement of predicting and analyzing the infection transmission, a novel CNN (Convolution Neural Network) based Covid Infection Transmission Analysis (CNN-CITA) is presented in this article. The method works based on both GIS data set and the Covid data set. The method reads all the data from the data sets. From the remote sensing data, the method extracts different climate conditions like temperature, humidity, and rainfall. Similarly from Global Information System data set, the locations of the peoples are fetched and merged. The merged data has been split into number of time frame, at each condition, the data sets are merged. Such merged data has been trained with deep learning networks which support the search of person location and mobility. Based on the result and the data set maintained by the governments, the infection transmission rate has been measured on region basis. In each region of movement performed by any person, the method computes the infection Transmission Rate (ITR) in two time window as before and after. According to the infection rate and ITR value of different region, a subset of sources are selected as vulnerable sources. The method produces higher performance in predicting the vulnerable sources and supports the reduction of infection rate.

METHOD AND MATERIALS: This split-mouth controlled randomized clinical study was performed on ten childrens, aged from 4 to 6 years, who needed complete oral rehabilitation under general anesthesia and had one pair or two pairs of their primary molars requiring pulpotomy. After pulp therapy, the teeth were randomly assigned to Figaro or PMC crown groups. Modified United States Public Health Service (USPHS) criteria were used to evaluate crown retention, marginal integration, crown discoloration, secondary caries, and gingival status, at 3 and 6 months. The data were analyzed using the chi-square test with Monte Carlo (MC) correction and McNemar (McN) test at a significance level of .05. RESULTS: Ten patients (three boys, 30%; seven girls, 70%) with a mean age of 4.65 ± 0.709 years participated in this study. At 3 months follow-up, there was no significant difference between the groups, but at 6 months follow-up, Figaro crowns showed significant changes from intact crown to either chipped or large loss, whereas all PMCs were found intact (&#967;2 = 14.545, P[MC] = 0.000). There was also significant deterioration in Figaro crowns' color after 6 months (&#967;2[McN] = 8.1, P = .004). CONCLUSION: PMCs were more durable than Figaro crowns, which showed significant deterioration after the 6-month follow-up period.","El-Habashy, Laila M; El Meligy, Omar A",Quintessence Int,,336

223409,"Impact of the first Covid-19 pandemic wave on first episode psychosis in Milan, italy",2021,"BACKGROUND: Previous outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have been associated with unfavourable pregnancy outcomes. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the human coronavirus family, and since this infection shows a pandemic trend it will involve many pregnant women. AIMS: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the impact of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) on maternal and neonatal outcomes. SOURCES: PubMed, EMBASE, MedRxiv, Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched up to 8th May 2020. Articles focusing on pregnancy and perinatal outcomes of COVID-19 were eligible. Participants were pregnant women with COVID-19. CONTENT: The meta-analysis was conducted following the PRISMA and MOOSE reporting guidelines. Bias risk was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) manual. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42042020184752). Twenty-four articles, including 1100 pregnancies, were selected. The pooled prevalence of pneumonia was 89% (95%CI 70-100), while the prevalence of women admitted to the intensive care unit was 8% (95%CI 1-20). Three stillbirths and five maternal deaths were reported. A pooled prevalence of 85% (95%CI 72-94) was observed for caesarean deliveries. There were three neonatal deaths. The prevalence of COVID-19-related admission to the neonatal intensive care unit was 2% (95%CI 0-6). Nineteen out of 444 neonates were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA at birth. Elevated levels of IgM and IgG Serum antibodies were reported in one case, but negative swab. IMPLICATIONS: Although adverse outcomes such as ICU admission or patient death can occur, the clinical course of COVID-19 in most women is not severe, and the infection does not significantly influence the pregnancy. A high caesarean delivery rate is reported, but there is no clinical evidence supporting this mode of delivery. Indeed, in most cases the disease does not threaten the mother, and vertical transmission has not been clearly demonstrated. Therefore, COVID-19 should not be considered as an indication for elective caesarean section.","Di Toro, Francesca; Gjoka, Mattheus; Di Lorenzo, Giovanni; De Santo, Davide; De Seta, Francesco; Maso, Gianpaolo; Risso, Francesco Maria; Romano, Federico; Wiesenfeld, Uri; Levi-D039,; Ancona, Roberto; Ronfani, Luca; Ricci, Giuseppe",Clin Microbiol Infect,,336

On March 13th, the Oncology Section was converted into a 22-inpatient bed coronavirus disease (COVID) Unit, and we reshaped our organisation to face the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, while maintaining oncological activities. METHODS: We tracked down (i) volumes of oncological activities (January 1st - March 31st, 2020 versus the same period of 2019), (ii) patients' and caregivers' perception and (iii) SARS-CoV-2 infection rate in oncology health professionals and SARS-CoV-2 infection-related hospital admissions of ""active""' oncological patients. RESULTS: As compared with the same trimester in 2019, the overall reduction in total numbers of inpatient admissions, chemotherapy administrations and specialist visits in January-March 2020 was 8%, 6% and 3%, respectively; based on the weekly average of daily accesses, reduction in some of the oncological activities became statistically significant from week 11. The overall acceptance of adopted measures, as measured by targeted questionnaires administered to a sample of 241 outpatients, was high (>70%). Overall, 8 of 85 oncology health professionals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection (all but one employed in the COVID Unit, no hospital admissions and no treatment required); among 471 patients admitted for SARS-CoV-2 infection, 7 had an ""active""' oncological disease (2 died of infection-related complications). CONCLUSIONS: A slight, but statistically significant reduction in oncology activity was registered during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic peak in Verona, Italy. Organisational and protective measures adopted appear to have contributed to keep infections in both oncological patients and health professionals to a minimum.","Zuliani, Serena; Zampiva, Ilaria; Tregnago, Daniela; Casali, Miriam; Cavaliere, Alessandro; Fumagalli, Arianna; Merler, Sara; Riva, Silvia Teresa; Rossi, Alice; Zacchi, Francesca; Zaninotto, Elisa; Auriemma, Alessandra; Pavarana, Michele; Soldà, Caterina; Benini, Lavinia; Borghesani, Michele; Caldart, Alberto; Casalino, Simona; Gaule, Marina; Kadrija, Dzenete; Mongillo, Marta; Pesoni, Camilla; Biondani, Pamela; Cingarlini, Sara; Fiorio, Elena; Melisi, Davide; Parolin, Veronica; Tondulli, Luca; Belluomini, Lorenzo; Zecchetto, Camilla; Avesani, Barbara; Biasi, Assunta; Bovo, Chiara; Dazzani, Elena; Dodi, Alessandra; Gelmini, Sara; Leta, Luigi Carmine; Lo Cascio, Giuliana; Lombardo, Fiorella; Lucin, Eleonora; Martinelli, Ilaria Asja; Messineo, Luisa; Moscarda, Viola; Pafumi, Sarah; Reni, Anna; Sartori, Giulia; Scaglione, Ilaria Mariangela; Shoval, Yiftach; Sposito, Marco; Tacconelli, Evelina",Eur J Cancer,,336

To identify therapeutically targetable mechanisms that are critical for SARS-CoV-2 infection, here we elucidated the Master Regulator (MR) proteins representing mechanistic determinants of the gene expression signature induced by SARS-CoV-2. The analysis revealed coordinated inactivation of MR-proteins linked to regulatory programs potentiating efficiency of viral replication (detrimental host MR-signature) and activation of MR-proteins governing innate immune response programs (beneficial MR-signature). To identify MR-inverting compounds capable of rescuing activity of inactivated host MR-proteins, with-out adversely affecting the beneficial MR-signature, we developed the ViroTreat algorithm. Overall, >80% of drugs predicted to be effective by this methodology induced significant reduction of SARS-CoV-2 infection, without affecting cell viability.

226543,"Pregnant Women's Reports of the Impact of COVID-19 on Pregnancy, Prenatal Care, and Infant Feeding Plans",2020,"BACKGROUND: From February 20 to April 2020, the coronavirus SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome)-CoV-2 spread in northern Italy, drastically challenging the care capacities of the national health care system. Unprepared for this emergency, hospitals have quickly reformulated paths of assistance in an effort to guarantee treatment for infected patients. Orthopaedic departments have been focused on elderly traumatology, especially the treatment of femoral neck fractures in patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the orthopaedic management strategy for femoral fragility fractures in COVID-19-positive patients with the hypothesis that operative treatment may contribute to the overall stability of the patient. METHODS: Sixteen patients affected by proximal femoral fracture and a recent history of fever, shortness of breath, and desaturation were admitted to the emergency room. Thoracic computed tomography (CT) and oropharyngeal swabs confirmed that they were positive for COVID-19, requiring hospitalization and prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin. RESULTS: Three patients died before surgery because of severe respiratory insufficiency and multiple-organ-failure syndrome. Ten patients underwent surgery on the day after admission, whereas 3 patients had suspended their use of direct thrombin inhibitors and needed surgery to be delayed until the third day after admission. In all patients except 1, we noted an improvement in terms of O2 saturation and assisted respiration. In 9 patients, hemodynamic and respiratory stability was observed at an average of 7 days postoperatively. Four patients who underwent surgical treatment died of respiratory failure on the first day after surgery (1 patient), the third day after surgery (2 patients), or the seventh day after surgery (1 patient). CONCLUSIONS: We noted a stabilization of respiratory parameters in 12 COVID-19-positive patients who underwent surgery treatment of proximal femoral fractures. We believe that in elderly patients with COVID-19 who have proximal femoral fractures, surgery may contribute to the overall stability of the patient, seated mobilization, improvement in physiological ventilation, and general patient comfort in bed.

In recognition of this gap, the editors of Prevention Science put out a call to scientists to help clarify and define the concept of a ""culture of prevention."" Such a culture would influence the creation of an infrastructure for implementing and sustaining the most effective strategies informed by research. The journal call stated a culture of prevention was a ""general orientation or readiness of a group of people to address problems by using a preventive, rather than a reactive approach."" This commentary examines the concept demonstrated in the array of papers presented here in which the ""culture of prevention"" is applied in different contexts-occupational safety and health, substance use, school, governmental, community, around problem behaviors, and violence. It is important to note that the papers represent perspectives and experiences from several countries, including some cross-national experiences providing an international framework.

Problem-based learning was used as a framework to create a scenario-based activity designed to develop GHD-related skills. The application and effectiveness of this scenario-based activity to develop GHD-related skills were assessed. A mixed-methods approach involving a self-administered survey and one focus group discussion was used. The survey collected baseline participant characteristics as well as understanding and improvements in GHD-related skills using a 5-point Likert scale. The focus group was audio-recorded and thematically analyzed using both inductive and deductive codes. Data integration was achieved by connecting and weaving. Method and investigator triangulation techniques were used. Participants self-reported significantly better postscenario-based activity responses when asked about their understanding of diplomacy, negotiation, communication, and how to address public health emergencies (P < 0.01, Wilcoxon signed rank test). Most participants either agreed or strongly agreed that their GHD-related skills improved with participation in the scenario-based activity (diplomacy = 55.6%; negotiation = 66.5%; communication = 72.2%; addressing public health emergencies = 72.1%). Overall, qualitative data were consistent with results obtained using quantitative methods. The scenario-based activity was effective for improving the self-reported understanding of GHD-related skills. The scenario-based activity was also effective for developing the selected GHD-related skills (as self-reported). This scenario-based activity is likely to reduce cognitive load and avoid participant overload, thereby facilitating learning.

229978,"""We are Alone in This Battle"": A Framework for a Coordinated Response to COVID-19 in Nursing Homes",2020,"In their recent article, Brown et al analyse several ethical aspects around immunity passports and put forward some recommendations for implementing them. Although they offer a comprehensive perspective, they overlook two essential aspects. First, while the authors consider the possibility that immunological passports may appear to discriminate against those who do not possess them, the opposite viewpoint of immune people is underdeveloped. We argue that if a person has been tested positive for and recovered from COVID-19, becoming immune to it, she cannot be considered a hazard to public health and, therefore, the curtailment of her fundamental rights (eg, the right to freedom of movement) is not legitimate. Second, they omit that vaccine distribution will create similar problems related to immunity-based licenses. Vaccine certificates will de facto generate a sort of immunity passport. In the next phases of the pandemic, different immunity statuses will be at stake, because the need to identify who can spread COVID-19 is unavoidable. If a person does not pose a threat to public health because she cannot spread the infection, then her right to freedom of movement should be respected, regardless of how she acquired that immunity.","de Miguel Beriain, Iñigo; Rueda, Jon",J Med Ethics,,336

230518,"The Healthy Brain and Child Development Study-Shedding Light on Opioid Exposure, COVID-19, and Health Disparities",2020,"RationaleWe recently demonstrated that a patient hood with a high efficiency particulate air filter eliminates virus aerosol contamination when very large quantities of bacteriophage virus are aerosolised into a clinical room. While this containment method is relatively low cost, it is unclear whether similar efficacy can be achieved with lower cost/commercial grade air purifiers, or if such an approach protects healthcare workers against virus aerosol contamination. MethodA total of 109 (10 ml of 108) PhiX174 bacteriophages was nebulized into a sealed clinical room. Surface contamination was detected by settle plates left uncovered during exposure. A healthcare worker remained in the room, personal exposure was determined by skin swabs after exiting the room, following doffing of personal protective equipment (PPE). Four skin areas were swabbed: forearms/hands, neck, forehead, under N95 mask. Three conditions were tested, 1) hood with hospital grade air purifier (IQ Air Health Pro 250), 2) hood with commercial air purifier (Philips 1000i), and 3) control (no hood/air-purification). FindingsThe control condition demonstrated extensive environmental and limited skin contamination underneath PPE, which was highest under an N95 mask. The commercial air purifier and hood provided environmental control of virus aerosol and almost zero skin contamination. In comparison, the hospital grade purifier provided complete environmental and skin contamination protection, despite a lower clean air filtration rate (240m3/hr vs 270m3/hr). Virus counts on plates and swabs were significantly lower for both air purifiers and across neck, forehead, and under the N95. There were no statistically significant differences in detected virus counts between air purifiers. ConclusionThis cheap and scalable method may be an effective way to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in hospitals by enhancing the effectiveness of PPE worn by health care workers who care for COVID-19 patients and who are exposed to virus aerosol. O_TEXTBOXTake home messageRelatively cheap portable air purifiers combined with a hood dramatically reduce the spread of virus aerosol and protect against environmental and healthcare worker contamination. Plain Language SummaryThis study shows that commercially available air purifiers, when combined with a hood that covers the head of a clinical bed, effectively capture very large amounts of virus aerosol in a simulated hospital setting. This virus containment strategy strongly reduced the number of viruses landing on surfaces in a clinical room. Crucially, this strategy also reduced that amount of virus detected on a healthcare workers skin underneath personal protective equipment, including under an N95 respirator. This cheap and scalable method may be an effective way to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in hospitals by enhancing the effectiveness of personal protective equipment worn by health care workers who care for COVID-19 patients and who are exposed to virus aerosol.

Identification of high-risk cases is critical for an early intervention. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to develop deep learning models that can rapidly identify high-risk COVID-19 patients based on computed tomography (CT) images and clinical data. METHODS: We analyzed 297 COVID-19 patients from five hospitals in Daegu, South Korea. A mixed artificial convolution neural network (ACNN) model, combining an artificial neural network for clinical data and a convolution neural network for 3D CT imaging data, is developed to classify these cases as either high risk of severe progression (event) or low risk (event-free). RESULTS: Using the mixed ACNN model, we were able to obtain high classification performance using novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) lesion images (93.9% accuracy, 80.8% sensitivity, 96.9% specificity, and 0.916 AUC) and lung segmentation images (94.3% accuracy, 74.7% sensitivity, 95.9% specificity, and 0.928 AUC) for event vs. event-free groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our study successfully differentiated high risk cases among COVID-19 patients using imaging and clinical features.

235429,Needed: Less influenza vaccine hesitancy and less presenteeism among health care workers in the COVID-19 era,2020,"Background: Up to 36% of patients admitted to the ICU for COVID-19 require tracheostomy. While the literature recommends the use of multidisciplinary teams in the management of patients with tracheostomy for other diseases, little is known on the collaborative administration of physical therapy and speech language pathology services in the COVID-19 population. Purpose: We sought to determine the outcomes of a collaboration between physical therapy (PT) and speech language pathology (SLP) in the treatment of patients who underwent tracheostomy placement as part of their treatment for COVID-19 at our facility. Methods: We conducted a retrospective case series on patients with COVID-19 who had a tracheostomy. We included patients who had undergone mechanical ventilation for 14 days or longer, had a surgical tracheostomy, been discharged from intensive care to a medical unit, and received PT and SLP referrals. We compiled retrospective data from electronic medical records, analyzing days from tracheostomy to achievement of PT and SLP functional milestones, including mobility, communication, and swallowing. Of six critically ill patients with COVID-19 who had tracheostomy placement at our facility, three met inclusion criteria: patient 1, a 33-year-old woman; patient 2, an 84-year-old man; and patient 3, an 81-year-old man. For all patients, PT interventions focused on breathing mechanics, secretion clearance, posture, sitting balance, and upper and lower extremity strengthening. SLP interventions focused on cognitive reorganization, verbal and nonverbal communication, secretion management, and swallowing function. Intensity and duration of the sessions were adapted according to patient response and level of fatigue. Results: We found that time to tracheostomy from intubation for the three patients was 23 days, 20 days, and 24 days, respectively. Time from tracheostomy insertion to weaning from ventilator was 9 days for patient 1, and 5 days for patient 2 and patient 3. Regarding time to achieve functional PT and SLP milestones, all patients achieved upright sitting with PT prior to achieving initial SLP milestone of voicing with finger occlusion. Variations in progression to swallowing trials were patient specific and due to respiratory instability, cognitive deficits, and limitations in production of an effortful swallow. Patient participation in therapy sessions improved following establishment of oral verbal communication. Conclusion: Interdisciplinary cooperation and synchronized implementation of PT and SLP interventions in three COVID-19 patients following prolonged intubation facilitated participation in treatment and achievement of functional milestones. Further study is warranted.","Mooney, Brianne; Lawrence, Cecelia; Johnson, Elizabeth Gerosa; Slaboden, Amanda; Ball, Karen",HSS J,,336
235468,Caring for a person with dementia during the COVID-19 pandemic: A qualitative study with family caregivers,2021,"Despite vigorous efforts, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to take a toll on the global health. The contemporary therapeutic regime focused on the viral spike proteins, viral 3CL protease enzyme, immunomodulation, inhibition of viral replication, and providing a symptomatic relief encouraged the repurposing of drugs to meet the urgency of treatment. Similarly, the representative drugs that proved beneficial to alleviate SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, HIV, ZIKV, H1N1, and malarial infection in the past presented a sturdy candidature for ameliorating the COVID-19 therapeutic doctrine. However, most of the deliberations for developing effective pharmaceuticals proved inconsequential, thereby encouraging the identification of new pathways, and novel pharmaceuticals for capping the COVID-19 infection. The COVID-19 contagion encompasses a burst release of the cytokines that increase the severity of the infection mainly due to heightened immunopathogenicity. The pro-inflammatory metabolites, COX-2, cPLA2, and 5-LOX enzymes involved in their generation, and the substrates that instigate the origination of the innate inflammatory response therefore play an important role in intensifying and worsening of the tissue morbidity related to the coronavirus infection. The deployment of representative drugs for inhibiting these overexpressed immunogenic pathways in the tissues invaded by coronaviruses has been a matter of debate since the inception of the pandemic. The effectiveness of NSAIDs such as Aspirin, Indomethacin, Diclofenac, and Celecoxib in COVID-19 coagulopathy, discouraging the SARS viral replication, the inflammasome deactivation, and synergistic inhibition of H5N1 viral infection with representative antiviral drugs respectively, have provided a silver lining in adjuvant COVID-19 therapy. Since the anti-inflammatory NSAIDs and COXIBs mainly function by reversing the COX-2 overexpression to modulate the overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, these drugs present a robust treatment option for COVID-19 infection. This commentary succinctly highlights the various claims that support the status of immunomodulatory NSAIDs, and COXIBs in the adjuvant COVID-19 therapy.","Prasher, Parteek; Sharma, Mousmee; Gunupuru, Ravi",Drug dev. res,,336

Here, we present the results of the pilot trial evaluating low-dose whole-lung irradiation (LD-WLI) in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: Ten patients with moderate COVID-19 pneumonia were treated with LD-WLI in a single fraction of 0.5 or 1.0 Gy along with the national protocol. The primary endpoint was the improvement in SpO2. The secondary endpoints were the number of hospital/ICU stay days, the number of intubations after RT, 28-day mortality, and changes in biomarkers. The response rate (RR) was defined as a rise in SpO2 upon RT with a rising or constant trend in the next 2 days, clinical recovery (CR) included patients who were discharged or acquired SpO2&#8805;93% on room air, and 28-day mortality rate was defined based on RT day. RESULTS: The median age was 75 years (80% male). Five, 1, and 4 patients received single 0.5Gy, two 0.5Gy, and single 1.0Gy LD-WLI, respectively. The mean improvement in SpO2 at days 1 and 2 after RT was 2.4% (±4.8%) and 3.6% (±6.1%), respectively, with improvement in 9 patients after 1 day. Five, 1, and 4 patients were discharged, opted out the trial, and died in hospital, respectively. Two of 5 discharged patients died within 3 days at home. Among discharged patients, the SpO2 at discharge was 81-88% in 3 and 93% in the other 2 patients. Overall, the RR and CR were 63.6% and 55.5%, respectively. The RR, CR, and 28-day mortality of single 0.5Gy- and 1.0Gy-WLI were 71.4 vs. 50% (p = 0.57), 60 vs. 50% (p = 0.64), and 50 vs. 75% (p = 0.57), respectively. CONCLUSION: LD-WLI with a single 0.5 Gy or 1 Gy-fraction is feasible. A randomized trial with patients that do not receive radiation is required to assess efficacy of LD-WLI for COVID-19.","Ameri, Ahmad; Ameri, Pooya; Rahnama, Nazanin; Mokhtari, Majid; Sedaghat, Meghdad; Hadavand, Fahimeh; Bozorgmehr, Rama; Haghighi, Mehrdad; Taghizadeh-Hesary, Farzad",Int. j. radiat. oncol. biol. phys,,336

This situation may poorly impact our capacity to care for critically injured patients. We need to devise a strategy to provide rational and essential care to hand trauma victims whilst the access to theatres and anaesthetic support is limited. Our center is a level 1 trauma center, where the pandemic preparedness required reorganization of the trauma services. We aim to summarise the clinical profile and management of these patients and highlight, how we modified our practice to optimize their care. Methods: This is a single-centre retrospective observational study of all patients with hand injuries visiting the Department of Plastic Surgery from 22nd March to 31st May 2020. Patient characteristics, management details, and outcomes were analysed. Results: A total of 102 hand injuries were encountered. Five patients were COVID-19 positive. The mean age was 28.9 ± 14.8 years and eighty-two (80.4%) were males. Thirty-one injuries involved fractures/dislocations, of which 23 (74.2%) were managed non-operatively. Seventy-five (73.5%) patients underwent wound wash or procedure under local anaesthetic and were discharged as soon as they were comfortable. Seventeen cases performed under brachial-plexus block, were discharged within 24 hours except four cases of finger replantation/ revascularisation and one flap cover which were discharged after monitoring for four days. At mean follow-up of 54.4 ± 21.8 days, the rates of early complication and loss to follow-up were 6.9% and 12.7% respectively. Conclusions: Essential trauma care needs to continue keeping in mind, rational use of resources while ensuring safety of the patients and health-care professionals. We need to be flexible and dynamic in our approach, by utilising teleconsultation, non-operative management, and regional anaesthesia wherever feasible.","Saha, Shivangi; Dash, Suvashis; Ansari, Mohammed Tahir; Bichupuriya, Ashish Dhanraj; Gupta, Amit Kumar; Singhal, Maneesh",J Hand Surg Asian Pac Vol,,336
236312,Physical exercise effects on the brain during COVID-19 pandemic: links between mental and cardiovascular health,2021,"Phylogenetics has played a pivotal role in the genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2, such as tracking the emergence and global spread of variants, and scientific communication. However, the rapid accumulation of genomic data from around the world -- with over two million genomes currently available in the GISAID database -- is testing the limits of standard phylogenetic methods. Here, we describe a new approach to rapidly analyze and visualize large numbers of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Using Python, genomes are filtered for problematic sites, incomplete coverage, and excessive divergence from a strict molecular clock. All differences from the reference genome, including indels, are extracted using minimap2, and compactly stored as a set of features for each genome. For each Pango lineage (https://cov-lineages.org), we collapse genomes with identical features into variants, generate 100 bootstrap samples of the feature set union to generate weights, and compute the symmetric differences between the weighted feature sets for every pair of variants. The resulting distance matrices are used to generate neigihbor-joining trees in RapidNJ and converted into a majority-rule consensus tree for the lineage. Branches with support values below 50% or mean lengths below 0.5 differences are collapsed, and tip labels on affected branches are mapped to internal nodes as directly-sampled ancestral variants. Currently, we process about million genomes in approximately nine hours on 34 cores. The resulting trees are visualized using the JavaScript framework D3.js as beadplots, in which variants are represented by horizontal line segments, annotated with beads representing samples by collection date. Variants are linked by vertical edges to represent branches in the consensus tree. These visualizations are published at https://filogeneti.ca/CoVizu.

The debate is an old one and the lesson we have yet to learn was tragically apparent a century ago during the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic. Any history of structural racism in America must begin with the chronicles of African Americans, Native Alaskans, and Indigenous North Americans as they were the originally enslaved and displaced people, subjected to overt and covert policies of oppression ever since. The experiences of Native Alaskans of Bristol Bay Alaska in 1918-1919 present a parallel, illuminating a wrenching example of structural racism that cost lives and impoverished society, then as now. Proven policy solutions exist to remove the structures that produce inequitable health outcomes, but implementing them will require public health officials and policymakers to take multidisciplinary policy actions, to find policy opportunities for change to be made, and, likely, a change in the political environment. The first exists now, the second is afforded because of the current pandemic and the urgent need for policy solutions, and the third is likely coming soon.","de Valpine, Maria Gilson; Lewis, Erica J",Public health nurs,,336

In this paper, the preclinical study of baicalein on the treatment of COVID-19 was performed. Results showed that baicalein inhibited cell damage induced by SARS-CoV-2 and improved the morphology of Vero E6 cells at a concentration of 0.1 µM and above. The effective concentration could be reached after oral administration of 200 mg/kg crystal form ß of baicalein in rats. Furthermore, baicalein significantly inhibited the body weight loss, the replication of the virus, and relieved the lesions of lung tissue in hACE2 transgenic mice infected with SARS-CoV-2. In LPS-induced acute lung injury of mice, baicalein improved the respiratory function, inhibited inflammatory cell infiltration in the lung, and decreased the levels of IL-1ß and TNF-&#945; in serum. In conclusion, oral administration of crystal form ß of baicalein could reach its effective concentration against SARS-CoV-2.

However, the detection, assessment, and response to rumors, stigma, and conspiracy theories in real time are a challenge. Therefore, we followed and examined COVID-19-related rumors, stigma, and conspiracy theories circulating on online platforms, including fact-checking agency websites, Facebook, Twitter, and online newspapers, and their impacts on public health. Information was extracted between December 31, 2019 and April 5, 2020, and descriptively analyzed. We performed a content analysis of the news articles to compare and contrast data collected from other sources. We identified 2,311 reports of rumors, stigma, and conspiracy theories in 25 languages from 87 countries. Claims were related to illness, transmission and mortality (24%), control measures (21%), treatment and cure (19%), cause of disease including the origin (15%), violence (1%), and miscellaneous (20%). Of the 2,276 reports for which text ratings were available, 1,856 claims were false (82%). Misinformation fueled by rumors, stigma, and conspiracy theories can have potentially serious implications on the individual and community if prioritized over evidence-based guidelines. Health agencies must track misinformation associated with the COVID-19 in real time, and engage local communities and government stakeholders to debunk misinformation.","Islam, Md Saiful; Sarkar, Tonmoy; Khan, Sazzad Hossain; Mostofa Kamal, Abu-Hena; Hasan, S M Murshid; Kabir, Alamgir; Yeasmin, Dalia; Islam, Mohammad Ariful; Amin Chowdhury, Kamal Ibne; Anwar, Kazi Selim; Chughtai, Abrar Ahmad; Seale, Holly",Am J Trop Med Hyg,,336

238602,Treatment for Anxiety and Substance Use Disorders During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Challenges and Strategies,2020,"OBJECTIVES: To describe the shift from in-person to virtual care within Veterans Affairs (VA) during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to identify at-risk patient populations who require greater resources to overcome access barriers to virtual care. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Outpatient encounters (N = 42,916,349) were categorized by care type (e.g. primary, mental health, etc.) and delivery method (e.g., in-person, video). For 5,400,878 Veterans, we used Generalized Linear models to identify patient sociodemographic and clinical characteristics associated with: 1) use of virtual (phone or video) care versus no virtual care and 2) use of video care versus no video care; between 3/11/2020 and 6/6/2020. RESULTS: By June, 58% of VA care was provided virtually compared to only 14% prior. Patients with lower income, higher disability, and more chronic conditions were more likely to receive virtual care during the pandemic. Yet, Veterans aged 45-64 and 65+ were less likely to use video care compared to those aged 18-44 (aRR 0.80 [95%CI 0.79, 0.82] and 0.50 [0.48, 0.52], respectively). Rural and homeless Veterans were 12% and 11% less likely to use video care compared to urban (0.88 [0.86, 0.90]) and non-homeless Veterans (0.89 [0.86, 0.92]). DISCUSSION: Veterans with high clinical or social need had higher likelihood of virtual service use early in the COVID-19 pandemic, however, older, homeless, and rural Veterans were less likely to have video visits, raising concerns for access barriers. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: While virtual care may expand access, access barriers must be addressed to avoid exacerbating disparities.","Ferguson, Jacqueline M; Jacobs, Josephine; Yefimova, Maria; Greene, Liberty; Heyworth, Leonie; Zulman, Donna M",J. am. med. inform. assoc,,336
238603,Treatment for Anxiety and Substance Use Disorders During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Challenges and Strategies,2020,"Uncertain graphs have been widely used to model complex linked data in many real-world applications, such as guaranteed-loan networks and power grids, where a node or edge may be associated with a probability. In these networks, a node usually has a certain chance of default or breakdown due to self-factors or the influence from upstream nodes. For regulatory authorities and companies, it is critical to efficiently identify the vulnerable nodes, i.e., nodes with high default risks, such that they could pay more attention to these nodes for the purpose of risk management. In this paper, we propose and investigate the problem of top-$k$ vulnerable nodes detection in uncertain graphs. We formally define the problem and prove its hardness. To identify the $k$ most vulnerable nodes, a sampling-based approach is proposed. Rigorous theoretical analysis is conducted to bound the quality of returned results. Novel optimization techniques and a bottom-$k$ sketch based approach are further developed in order to scale for large networks. In the experiments, we demonstrate the performance of proposed techniques on 3 real financial networks and 5 benchmark networks. The evaluation results show that the proposed methods can achieve up to 2 orders of magnitudes speedup compared with the baseline approach. Moreover, to further verify the advantages of our model in real-life scenarios, we integrate the proposed techniques with our current loan risk control system, which is deployed in the collaborated bank, for more evaluation. Particularly, we show that our proposed new model has superior performance on real-life guaranteed-loan network data, which can better predict the default risks of enterprises compared to the state-of-the-art techniques.","Cheng, Dawei; Chen, Chen; Wang, Xiaoyang; Xiang, Sheng",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.12383v5.pdf,336

During the last years, this pathogen displayed multidrug resistance (MDR), mainly due to extensive antibiotic abuse and poor stewardship. MDR isolates are associated with medical history of long hospitalization stays, presence of catheters, and mechanical ventilation, while immunocompromised and severely ill hosts predispose to invasive infections. Next-generation sequencing techniques have revolutionized diagnosis of severe A. baumannii infections, contributing to timely diagnosis and personalized therapeutic regimens according to the identification of the respective resistance genes. The aim of this review is to describe in detail all current knowledge on the genetic background of A. baumannii resistance mechanisms in humans as regards beta-lactams (penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactams, and beta-lactamase inhibitors), aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, macrolides, lincosamides, streptogramin antibiotics, polymyxins, and others (amphenicols, oxazolidinones, rifamycins, fosfomycin, diaminopyrimidines, sulfonamides, glycopeptide, and lipopeptide antibiotics). Mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance refer mainly to regulation of antibiotic transportation through bacterial membranes, alteration of the antibiotic target site, and enzymatic modifications resulting in antibiotic neutralization. Virulence factors that may affect antibiotic susceptibility profiles and confer drug resistance are also being discussed. Reports from cases of A. baumannii coinfection with SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of resistance profiles and MDR genes have been investigated.","Kyriakidis, Ioannis; Vasileiou, Eleni; Pana, Zoi Dorothea; Tragiannidis, Athanasios",,,336
238798,COVID-19 pandemic - environmental perspective of COVID-19 and a primer for all of us,2021,"PURPOSE: Current treatments for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lung disease have limited efficacy. Low-dose radiation therapy (LDRT) has received both interest and criticism as a potential treatment for this condition. In this qualitative study we explored clinicians' perspectives to identify barriers to testing LDRT in clinical trials and implementing it in clinical practice. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Semistructured interviews were undertaken with 6 clinicians from 3 medical disciplines. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed thematically, using a framework approach. Common themes regarding barriers to using LDRT for COVID-19 lung disease were identified from the data. RESULTS: Three categories of barriers emerged: (1) the potential to do harm to the patient, including difficulty in predicting harm and lack of existing data to inform quantification of risks; (2) the feasibility of trialing this novel treatment strategy in the clinical setting, in particular trial design and recruitment, patient selection and buy-in from relevant clinician groups; and (3) the logistics of delivering the treatment, in particular risks of transmission to other patients and resources required for patient transfer. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified several barriers that may impede the evaluation and subsequent implementation of LDRT as a treatment for COVID-19 lung disease, from the perspectives of clinicians in 3 relevant specialties. By documenting and articulating these concerns, we hope to enhance discussion of why these barriers exist, and enable them to be addressed in a proactive manner to facilitate research into the potential benefits of radiation treatment for patients with COVID-19 lung disease going forward.","Hanna, Catherine R; Robb, Kathryn A; Blyth, Kevin G; Jones, Robert J; Chalmers, Anthony J",Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,,336

Energy consumption and benefits of nanofiltration processes are directly determined by the selectivity of the nanofiltration membranes, which is largely governed by pore-size distribution and Donnan effects. During operation, the separation performance of unmodified nanofiltration membranes will also be impacted (deleteriously) upon unavoidable membrane fouling. Many efforts, therefore, have been directed toward enhancing the selectivity of nanofiltration membranes, which can be classified into membrane fabrication method improvement and process intensification. This review summarizes recent developments in the field and provides guidance for potential future approaches to improve the selectivity of nanofiltration membranes.","Zhang, Huiru; He, Qiming; Luo, Jianquan; Wan, Yinhua; Darling, Seth B",ACS appl. mater. interfaces (Online),,336

MethodsWe used state-level Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case and mortality data between January 19, 2020 and March 7, 2021 to model NPI policy effectiveness. Empirically derived breakpoints in case and mortality velocities were used to identify periods of stable, decreasing, or increasing COVID-19 burden. The associations between NPI adoption and subsequent decreases in case or death velocities were estimated using generalized linear models accounting for weekly variability shared across states. State-level NPI policies included: stay at home order, indoor public gathering ban (mild >10 or severe [≤]10), indoor restaurant dining ban, and public mask mandate. Results28,602,830 cases and 511,899 deaths were recorded. The odds of a decrease in COVID-19 case velocity were significantly elevated for stay at home (OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.63-2.52), indoor dining ban (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.25-2.10), public mask mandate (OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.47-3.23), and severe gathering ban (OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.31-2.16).

To ensure an easy and consistent movement of the plunger, the inner glass container surface is typically siliconized. For bake-on siliconization emulsions are sprayed on and heat treated. Due to the European Union regulation REACh (Regulation concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals) the use of certain emulsion components, partially constituting the gold standard Liveo&#8482; 365 35% Dimethicone NF Emulsion (Liveo&#8482; 365), becomes restricted and Liveo&#8482; 366 35% Dimethicone NF Emulsion (Liveo&#8482; 366) has been introduced as an alternative. This change may affect the handling properties as well as the silicone layer formed. The purpose of these studies was to identify any differences that may influence the stability and safety of the final drug/device combination product to enable the use of the new emulsion. We compared silicone emulsions Liveo&#8482; 365 and Liveo&#8482; 366 and dilutions focusing on I) their general physical stability, II) the thermal degradation process of the emulsions and their components, and III) the resulting silicone layer concerning chemistry, morphology, and functionality. The results were linked to the assessment of the final product regarding particle formation and long-term stability. A comparison of the emulsions Liveo&#8482; 365 and Liveo&#8482; 366 for bake-on siliconization is presented to support the transition of the latter as it becomes mandatory with REACh. Our studies show that the two emulsions do not significantly differ with respect to handling and stability, the resultant silicone layer characteristics as well as its functionality. We conclude that the transition to the new emulsion will not significantly impact the final product or the layer performance upon storage and with respect to particle formation.","Moll, Fabian; Bechtold-Peters, Karoline; Mellman, James; Sigg, Jurgen; Friess, Wolfgang",PDA j. pharm. sci. technol,,336

245309,COVID-19 and Telehealth in older adult psychiatry-opportunities for now and the future,2020,"BACKGROUND: There is limited data on outcomes in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) in rural United States (US). This study aimed to describe the demographics, and outcomes of hospitalized Covid-19 patients in rural Southwest Georgia. METHODS: Using electronic medical records, we analyzed data from all hospitalized Covid-19 patients who either died or survived to discharge between 2 March 2020 and 6 May 2020. RESULTS: Of the 522 patients, 92 died in hospital (17.6%). Median age was 63 years, 58% were females, and 87% African-Americans. Hypertension (79.7%), obesity (66.5%) and diabetes mellitus (42.3%) were the most common comorbidities. Males had higher overall mortality compared to females (23 v 13.8%). Immunosuppression [odds ratio (OR) 3.6; (confidence interval (CI): 1.52-8.47, p=.003)], hypertension (OR 3.36; CI:1.3-8.6, p=.01), age &#8805;65 years (OR 3.1; CI:1.7-5.6, p<.001) and morbid obesity (OR 2.29; CI:1.11-4.69, p=.02), were independent predictors of in-hospital mortality. Female gender was an independent predictor of decreased in-hospital mortality. Mortality in intubated patients was 67%. Mortality was 8.9% in <50 years, compared to 20% in &#8805;50 years. CONCLUSIONS: Immunosuppression, hypertension, age &#8805; 65 years and morbid obesity were independent predictors of mortality, whereas female gender was protective for mortality in hospitalized Covid-19 patients in rural Southwest Georgia. KEY MESSAGES Patients hospitalized with Covid-19 in rural US have higher comorbidity burden. Immunosuppression, hypertension, age &#8805; 65 years and morbid obesity are independent predictors of increased mortality.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective study in SARS-CoV-2 infected outpatients with OGD. Weekly phone interviews were set up starting from COVID-19 onset symptoms and over the course of 60 days, using standardized questionnaires that included a detailed description of general symptoms and OGD. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with complete recovery of OGD at D30. Rate and time to recovery of OGD, as well as risk factors for late recovery (>30 days), were evaluated using Cox regression models. RESULTS: Ninety-eight outpatients were included. The median time to onset of OGD after first COVID-19 symptoms was 2 days (IQR 0-4). The 30-day recovery rate from OGD was 67.5% (95% CI 57.1-75.4) and the estimated median time of OGD recovery was 20 days (95% CI 13-26). Risk factors for late recovery of OGD were a complete loss of smell or taste at diagnosis (HR=0.26, 95% CI 0.12-0.56, P=0.0005) and age over 40 years (HR=0.56, 95% CI 0.36-0.89, P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients with complete loss of smell or taste and over age 40 are more likely to develop persistent OGD and should rapidly receive sensorial rehabilitation.","Cousyn, L; Sellem, B; Palich, R; Bendetowicz, D; Agher, R; Delorme, C; Tubiana, R; Valantin, M-A; Seang, S; Schneider, L; Fayçal, A; Dudoit, Y; Abdi, B; Ndoadoumgue, A; Assoumou, L; Katlama, C",,,336

Therefore, recognizing and treating the cardiovascular sign and symptoms that caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can be effective in reducing patient mortality. To control the COVID-19-related cardiovascular symptoms, natural products are considered one of the promising choices as complementary medicine. Scientists are struggling to discover new antiviral agents specific to this virus. In this review, the natural products for management of cardiovascular symptoms of COVID-19 are categorized into three groups: (a) natural products with an impact on angiotensin II type 1 receptor; (b) natural products that inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme activity; and (c) natural products that mimic adenosine activity. All these natural products should undergo clinical investigations to test their efficacy, safety, and toxicity in the treatment of cardiovascular symptoms of COVID-19.

This article summarizes the results from comparative tests of combustion and gasification of two complex plastic wastes: a plastic reject (PR) from processing recycled paper and an automotive shredder residue (ASR). Calculated gasification efficiencies corresponded to about 80% and 60%, respectively. Gasification resulted in lower yields of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/F) compared to direct combustion. A two-stage process, including gasification followed by syngas combustion, reduced the emissions of HCl and PCDD/F in the flue gas to <1.4% and <0.2%, respectively, compared to the levels from direct combustion of the PR feedstock. Most of the PCDD/F (>99%) was captured along with particulate matter (soot) during gasification. The contribution to the toxic concentration of PCDD/F was mainly from the PCDF congeners. Fly ash particulate matter from ASR combustion contained a significant proportion of zinc, which thus constitutes a great potential for use in zinc recycling.","Weiland, Fredrik; Lundin, Lisa; Celebi, Mustafa; van der Vlist, Klaas; Moradian, Farzad",Waste Manag,,336

249572,Factors affecting the emergence of diplomacy in Iranian nurse managers: a qualitative study,2021,"Information diffusion and virus propagation are fundamental processes taking place in networks. While it is often possible to directly observe when nodes become infected with a virus or adopt the information, observing individual transmissions (i.e., who infects whom, or who influences whom) is typically very difficult. Furthermore, in many applications, the underlying network over which the diffusions and propagations spread is actually unobserved. We tackle these challenges by developing a method for tracing paths of diffusion and influence through networks and inferring the networks over which contagions propagate. Given the times when nodes adopt pieces of information or become infected, we identify the optimal network that best explains the observed infection times. Since the optimization problem is NP-hard to solve exactly, we develop an efficient approximation algorithm that scales to large datasets and finds provably near-optimal networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by tracing information diffusion in a set of 170 million blogs and news articles over a one year period to infer how information flows through the online media space. We find that the diffusion network of news for the top 1,000 media sites and blogs tends to have a core-periphery structure with a small set of core media sites that diffuse information to the rest of the Web. These sites tend to have stable circles of influence with more general news media sites acting as connectors between them.","Gomez-Rodriguez, Manuel; Leskovec, Jure; Krause, Andreas",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1006.0234v3.pdf,336
249626,Impact of social isolation on the level of physical activity in young Brazilian athletes caused by COVID-19,2021,"Bacterial biofilms are communities of bacteria entangled in a self-produced extracellular matrix (ECM). Escherichia coli direct the assembly of two insoluble biopolymers, curli amyloid fibers, and phosphoethanolamine (pEtN) cellulose, to build remarkable biofilm architectures. Intense curiosity surrounds how bacteria harness these amyloid-polysaccharide composites to build biofilms, and how these biopolymers function to benefit bacterial communities. Defining ECM composition involving insoluble polymeric assemblies poses unique challenges to analysis and, thus, to comparing strains with quantitative ECM molecular correlates. In this work, we present results from a sum-of-the-parts 13 C solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis to define the curli-to-pEtN cellulose ratio in the isolated ECM of the E. coli laboratory K12 strain, AR3110. We compare and contrast the compositional analysis and comprehensive biofilm phenotypes for AR3110 and a well-studied clinical isolate, UTI89. The ECM isolated from AR3110 contains approximately twice the amount of pEtN cellulose relative to curli content as UTI89, revealing plasticity in matrix assembly principles among strains. The two parent strains and a panel of relevant gene mutants were investigated in three biofilm models, examining: (a) macrocolonies on agar, (b) pellicles at the liquid-air interface, and (c) biomass accumulation on plastic. We describe the influence of curli, cellulose, and the pEtN modification on biofilm phenotypes with power in the direct comparison of these strains. The results suggest that curli more strongly influence adhesion, while pEtN cellulose drives cohesion. Their individual and combined influence depends on both the biofilm modality (agar, pellicle, or plastic-associated) and the strain itself.","Jeffries, Jamie; Thongsomboon, Wiriya; Visser, Joshua Alan; Enriquez, Kyle; Yager, Deborah; Cegelski, Lynette",Biopolymers,,336

This paper evaluates the prevalence, psychological responses, and associated correlates of depression, anxiety, and stress in a global population during the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic. A cross-sectional study design was adopted. 678 completed forms were collected during the COVID-19 quarantine/lockdown. An online questionnaire was designed and DASS-21 was used as the screening tool. A non-probability sampling technique strategy was applied. 50.9% of participants showed traits of anxiety, 57.4% showed signs of stress, and 58.6% exhibited depression. Stress, anxiety, and depression are overwhelmingly prevalent across the globe during this COVID-19 pandemic, and multiple factors can influence the rates of these mental health conditions. Our factorial analysis showed notable associations and manifestations of stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. People aged 18-24, females, and people in non-marital relationships experienced stress, anxiety, and depression. Separated individuals experienced stress and anxiety. Married people experienced anxiety. Single and divorced people experienced depression. Unemployed individuals experienced stress and depression. Students experienced anxiety and depression. Canada, the UK, and Pakistan are all countries that are experiencing stress and depression as a whole.

254514,Addressing Hearing Loss to Improve Communication During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"Since February-2020, the world has been battling a tragic public-health crisis with the emergence and spread of 2019-nCoV. Due to the lack of information about the pathogenesis-specific treatment of Covid-19, early diagnosis and timely treatment are important. However, there is still a lack of information about routine-blood-parameteres (RBP) findings and effects in the disease process. Although the literature includes various interventions, existing studies need to be generalized and their reliability improved. In this study, the efficacy of routine blood values used in the diagnosis and prognosis of Covid-19 and independent biomarkers obtained from them were evaluated retrospectively in a large patient group. Low lymphocyte (LYM) and white-blood-cell (WBC), high CRP and Ferritin were effective in the diagnosis of the disease. The (d-CWL) = CRPWBC&#8727;LYM and (d-CFL) = CRP&#8727;FerritinLYM biomarkers derived from them were the most important risk factors in diagnosing the disease and were more successful than direct RBP values. High d-CWL and d-CFL values largely confirmed the Covid-19 diagnosis. The most effective RBP in the prognosis of the disease was CRP. (d-CIT) = CRP*INR*Troponin; (d-CT) = CRP*Troponin; (d-PPT) = PT*Troponin*Procalcitonin biomarkers were found to be more successful than direct RBP values and biomarkers used in previous studies in the prognosis of the disease. In this study, biomarkers derived from RBP were found to be more successful in both diagnosis and prognosis of Covid-19 than previously used direct RBP and biomarkers.","Huyut, Mehmet Tahir; Ilkbahar, Fatih",Int Immunopharmacol,,336
254590,Psychosocial Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic in Elderly Psychiatric Patients: a Longitudinal Study,2021,"BACKGROUND: The United States (US) is ranked 22nd on the Global Terrorism Index (2019), a scoring system of terrorist activities. While the global number of deaths from terrorism over the past five years is down, the number of countries affected by terrorism is growing and the health care repercussions remain significant. Counter-Terrorism Medicine (CTM) is rapidly emerging as a necessary sub-specialty, and this study aims to provide the epidemiological context over the past decade supporting this need by detailing the unique injury types responders are likely to encounter and setting the stage for the development of training programs utilizing these data. METHODS: The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) was searched for all attacks in the US from 2008-2018. Attacks met inclusion criteria if they fulfilled the three terrorism-related criteria as set by the GTD. Ambiguous events were excluded when there was uncertainty as to whether the incident met all of the criteria for inclusion in the GTD. The grey literature was reviewed, and each event was cross-matched with reputable international and national newspaper sources online to confirm or add details regarding weapon type used and, whenever available, details of victim and perpetrator fatalities and injuries. RESULTS: In total, 304 events were recorded during the period of study. Of the 304 events, 117 (38.5%) used incendiary-only weapons, 80 (26.3%) used firearms as their sole weapon, 55 (18.1%) used explosives, bombs, or dynamite (E/B/D), 23 (7.6%) were melee-only, six (2.0%) used vehicles-only, four (1.3%) were chemicals-only, two (0.7%) used sabotage equipment, two (0.7%) were listed as ""others,"" and one (0.3%) used biological weapon. There was no recorded nuclear or radiological weapon use. In addition, 14 (4.6%) events used a mix of weapons. CONCLUSIONS: In the decade from 2008 through 2018, terrorist attacks on US soil used weapons with well-understood injury-causing modalities. A total of 217 fatal injuries (FI) and 660 non-fatal injuries (NFI) were sustained as a result of these events during that period.Incendiary weapons were the most commonly chosen methodology, followed by firearms and E/B/D attacks. Firearm events contributed to a disproportionality high fatality count while E/B/D events contributed to a disproportionally high NFI count.","Tin, Derrick; Hart, Alexander; Ciottone, Gregory R",Prehosp Disaster Med,,336
254739,Economic impact of new biosafety recommendations for dental clinical practice during covid-19 pandemic,2020,"A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome, called Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is originated in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Due to its extreme transmissibility with droplets and human contacts, in a few months, it has become pandemic. Nowadays, no effective therapy is available, and the scientific community is moving to find a therapeutic choice to fight this silent enemy. Studies are ongoing on several therapeutic options, including antiviral agents, immunomodulant drugs, immunotherapy. Due to viral features, including the ability to start an inflammatory response that seems to be the fulcrum of COVID-19 pathogenic action, immunotherapy could represent a promising alternative waiting for the vaccine. High dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), already used in other infectious diseases could represent an effective help. The aim of this narrative review is to reassemble the clinical experiences on the use of IVIg in COVID-19 and the rationale of its use. This article is protected by copyright.

255451,Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on immunization services in Nigeria;A preliminary report by Paediatric Association of Nigeria (PAN),2020,"The Covid-19 pandemic has radically changed our lives. Under different circumstances, people react to it in various ways. One way is to work-from-home since lockdown has been announced in many regions around the world. For some places, however, we don't know if people really work from home due to the lack of information. Since there are lots of uncertainties, it would be helpful for us to understand what really happen in these places if we can detect the reaction to the Covid-19 pandemic. Working from home indicates that people have changed the way they interact with the Internet. People used to access the Internet in the company or at school during the day. Now it is more likely that they access the Internet at home in the daytime. Therefore, the network usage changes in one place can be used to indicate if people in this place actually work from home. In this work, we reuse and analyze Trinocular outages data (around 5.1M responsive /24 blocks) over 6 months to find network usage changes by a new designed algorithm. We apply the algorithm to sets of /24 blocks in several cities and compare the detected network usage changes with real world covid-19 events to verify if the algorithm can capture the changes reacting to the Covid-19 pandemic. By applying the algorithm to all measurable /24 blocks to detect network usages changes, we conclude that network usage can be an indicator of the reaction to the Covid-19 pandemic.","Song, Xiao; Heidemann, John",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.07433v3.pdf,336

256581,Dental Care and Oral Health under the Clouds of COVID-19,2020,"When a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) made major headlines in 2020, it further exposed an existing public health crisis related to inequities within our communities and health care delivery system. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, populations of color had higher infection and mortality rates, and even experienced greater disease severity compared to whites. Populations of color often bear the brunt of COVID-19 and other health inequities, due to the multifaceted relationship between systemic racism and the social determinants of health. As this relationship continues to perpetuate health inequities, the local health department is an agency that has the jurisdiction and responsibility to prevent disease and protect the health of the communities they serve. When equity is integrated into a health department's operational infrastructure as a disease prevention strategy, it can elevate the agency's response to public health emergencies. Collecting, reporting, and tracking demographic data that is necessary to identify inequities becomes a priority to facilitate a more robust public health response. The purpose of this paper is to present strategies of how a local health department operationalized equity in various stages of COVID-19 response and apply these methods to future public health emergencies to better serve vulnerable communities.","Burwell-Naney, Kristen; Mortiboy, Marissa; Zitta, John-Paul; Stevens, Elizabeth; Patterson, Kristen; Salter, James Christopher; Easterling, Michele; Bickers Bock, Lindsey; Wood, Hattie; Rayner, Malkia; Jenkins, Rodney",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,336

Emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases in the future need to be tackled by developing behavioral immunity through effective BCC strategies. Health education and Information Education and Communication gradually evolved to BCC primarily focusing on creating a conducive environment for promoting behavior change. Various theories/models operating at the individual, inter-personal, and community levels were put forward to explain the core constructs of behavior change. Each theory/model has its own strengths and weaknesses in its applicability. In practice, no theory is perfect and each has certain limitations. Hence, a battery of theories may be needed to develop a BCC strategy. This review article critically appraises the evolution of BCC, the strengths and weaknesses of BCC theories/models and it’s applicability from the past to the future.

258496,"Knowledge, attitude, and practice of forensic practitioners during COVID-19 pandemic in Arab countries",2021,"AIMS: A new human coronavirus (HCoV), which has been designated SARS-CoV-2, began spreading in December 2019 in Wuhan City, China causing pneumonia called COVID-19. The spread of SARS-CoV-2 has been faster than any other coronaviruses that have succeeded in crossing the animal-human barrier. There is concern that this new virus will spread around the world as did the previous two HCoVs-Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-each of which caused approximately 800 deaths in the years 2002 and 2012, respectively. Thus far, 11,268 deaths have been reported from the 258,842 confirmed infections in 168 countries. MAIN METHODS: In this study, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of the newly emerged coronavirus is modeled, validated, and then targeted using different anti-polymerase drugs currently on the market that have been approved for use against various viruses. KEY FINDINGS: The results suggest the effectiveness of Ribavirin, Remdesivir, Sofosbuvir, Galidesivir, and Tenofovir as potent drugs against SARS-CoV-2 since they tightly bind to its RdRp. In addition, the results suggest guanosine derivative (IDX-184), Setrobuvir, and YAK as top seeds for antiviral treatments with high potential to fight the SARS-CoV-2 strain specifically. SIGNIFICANCE: The availability of FDA-approved anti-RdRp drugs can help treat patients and reduce the danger of the mysterious new viral infection COVID-19. The drugs mentioned above can tightly bind to the RdRp of the SARS-CoV-2 strain and thus may be used to treat the disease. No toxicity measurements are required for these drugs since they were previously tested prior to their approval by the FDA.","Elfiky, Abdo A",Life Sci,,336

METHODS: The ENCOVID multicentre study included patients with encephalitis with full infectious screening, CSF, EEG, MRI data and confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection recruited from 13 centres in northern Italy. Clinical presentation and laboratory markers, severity of COVID-19 disease, response to treatment and outcomes were recorded. RESULTS: twenty-five cases of encephalitis positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. CSF showed hyperproteinorrachia and/or pleocytosis in 68% of cases whereas SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR resulted negative. Based on MRI, cases were classified as ADEM (n=3), limbic encephalitis (LE, n=2), encephalitis with normal imaging (n=13) and encephalitis with MRI alterations (n=7). ADEM and LE cases showed a delayed onset compared to the other encephalitis (p=0.001) and were associated with previous more severe COVID-19 respiratory involvement. Patients with MRI alterations exhibited worse response to treatment and final outcomes compared to other encephalitis.

This study aimed to identify predictive indicators of severe COVID-19. METHODS: We retrospectively collected clinical data on hospital admission of all patients with severe COVID-19 and a control cohort (1:1) of gender- and hospital-matched patients with mild disease from 13 designated hospitals in the Hebei Province between 22 January and 15 April 2020. RESULTS: A total of 104 patients (52 with severe COVID-19 and 52 with mild disease) were included. Only age, fever, duration from symptom onset to confirmation, respiratory rate, percutaneous oxygen saturation (SpO2 ) and neutrophilic percentage were independent predictors of severe COVID-19. Age and neutrophilic percentage performed best in predicting severe COVID-19, followed by SpO2 . 'Age + neutrophilic percentage' (the sum of age and neutrophilic percentage) (area under the curve [AUC] 0.900, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.825-0.950, P < .001) and 'age and neutrophilic percentage' (the prediction probability of age and neutrophilic percentage for severe type obtained by logistic regression analysis) (AUC 0.899, 95% CI 0.824-0.949, P < .001) had excellent predictive performance for severe type. The optimal cut-off for 'age + neutrophilic percentage' was >119.1 (sensitivity, 86.5%; specificity, 84.6%; Youden index, 0.712). CONCLUSION: The combination of age and neutrophil percentage could effectively predict severe COVID-19.

We collected retrospective observational data on thrombosis and bleeding in 303 consecutive adult patients admitted to the hospital for at least 24 hours for COVID-19. Patients presenting with VTE on admission were excluded. Data were collected until 90 days after admission or known death by using medical records and an established national VTE network. Maximal level of care was ward based in 78% of patients, with 22% requiring higher dependency care (12% noninvasive ventilation, 10% invasive ventilation). Almost all patients (97.0%) received standard thromboprophylaxis or were already receiving therapeutic anticoagulation (17.5%). Symptomatic image-confirmed VTE occurred in 5.9% of patients during index hospitalization, and in 7.2% at 90 days after admission (23.9% in patients requiring higher dependency care); half the events were isolated segmental or subsegmental defects on lung imaging. Bleeding occurred in 13 patients (4.3%) during index hospitalization (1.3% had major bleeding). The majority of bleeds occurred in patients on the general ward, and 6 patients were receiving treatment-dose anticoagulation, highlighting the need for caution in intensifying standard thromboprophylaxis strategies. Of 152 patients discharged from the hospital without an indication for anticoagulation, 97% did not receive thromboprophylaxis after discharge, and 3% received 7 days of treatment with low molecular weight heparin after discharge. The rate of symptomatic VTE in this group at 42 days after discharge was 2.6%, highlighting the need for large prospective randomized controlled trials of extended thromboprophylaxis after discharge in COVID-19.","Salisbury, Richard; Iotchkova, Valentina; Jaafar, Sarah; Morton, Joshua; Sangha, Gavinda; Shah, Akshay; Untiveros, Paraskevi; Curry, Nicola; Shapiro, Susan",Blood Adv,,336
269750,Stress and sleep: A survey based on wearable sleep trackers among medical and nursing staff in Wuhan during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"AIM: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the New Zealand government enforced a nationwide 'alert level 4' lockdown from 26 March to 27 April 2020. We assessed the impact of this lockdown on New Zealand's public ophthalmology service. METHOD: An anonymous online survey was sent to all New Zealand-based fellows of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists (RANZCO) after lockdown. Respondents provided retrospective assessment of practice patterns and their personal health during the COVID-19 lockdown. This was supported by national-level administrative data, allowing survey findings to be contextualised. RESULTS: Fifty-seven respondents (response rate 49%) working in the public health system participated. A large majority of respondents reduced elective clinic and surgical volumes by at least 75% (82% and 98%, respectively). National-level information confirmed clinic reduced to 38.2% of normal and elective operating volumes to 11.5%, with virtual visits increasing 17.9-fold. Elective clinic and elective operating volumes promptly recovered to usual volumes on the second month post lockdown. Most respondents (58%) followed the RANZCO triaging guideline, and 28% triaged emergencies only. At a personal level, respondents reported a significant physical health benefit (p&lt;0.001) associated with the lockdown experience, but no change in mental health or social wellbeing. CONCLUSIONS: Publicly employed ophthalmologists experienced dramatic reductions to elective clinic and operating volumes during the COVID-19 lockdown. The prompt recovery of service delivery volumes back to pre-lockdown levels supports the value of a COVID-19 elimination strategy in New Zealand. Virtual visits for selected patients allowed ongoing management without risking virus transmission.","Scott, D. A. R.; Hadden, P. W.; Wilson, G. A.",New Zealand Medical Journal,,336

270128,Challenges in women with diabetes during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Aims: Now that we are in the deceleration phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, the focus has shifted to how to safely reinstate elective operating. Regional and speciality specific data is important to guide this decision-making process. This study aimed to review 30-day mortality for all patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery during the peak of the pandemic within our region. Methods: This multicentre study reviewed data on all patients undergoing trauma and orthopaedic surgery in a region from 18 March 2020 to 27 April 2020. Information was collated from regional databases. Patients were COVID-19-positive if they had positive laboratory testing and/or imaging consistent with the infection. 30-day mortality was assessed for all patients. Secondly, 30-day mortality in fracture neck of femur patients was compared to the same time period in 2019. Results: Overall, 496 operations were carried out in 484 patients. The overall 30-day mortality was 1.9%. Seven out of nine deceased patients underwent surgery for a fractured neck of femur. In all, 27 patients contracted COVID-19 in the peri-operative period; of these, four patients died within 30 days (14.8%). In addition, 21 of the 27 patients in this group had a fractured neck of femur, 22 were over the age of 70 years (81.5%). Patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade > 3 and/or age > 75 years were at significantly higher risk of death if they contracted COVID-19 within the study period. Conclusion: Overall 30-day postoperative mortality in trauma and orthopaedic surgery patients remains low at 1.9%. There was no 30-day mortality in patients ASA 1 or 2. Patients with significant comorbidities, increasing age, and ASA 3 or above remain at the highest risk. For patients with COVID-19 infection, postoperative 30-day mortality was 14.8%. The reintroduction of elective services should consider individual patient risk profile (including for ASA grade). Effective postoperative strategies should also be employed to try and reduce postoperative exposure to the virus.Cite this article: Bone Joint Open 2020;1-7:392-397.","Karayiannis, Paul N; Roberts, Veronica; Cassidy, Roslyn; Mayne, Alistair I W; McAuley, Daryl; Milligan, David J; Diamond, Owen",Bone Jt Open,,336

In this study, the authors present the preliminary results (April 1-5, 2020) of a public risk perception study of COVID­19. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The online questionnaire survey was announced in the national TV and radio stations with the nationwide coverage. Respondents were recruited through the website of the University of Ostrava during the first 5 days of the survey (N = 7966). The data covered risk perception with a focus on physical and psychological aspects, the current socio-economic situation and adaptation to the lockdown. The authors used Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests, as well as ordered logistic regression, with a significance level of 5% using STATA version 15. RESULTS: From the total sample of the respondents aged 40 years on average (a range of 15-87 years), the present study shows that women (p < 0.001) and elderly people (p < 0.001) perceived the health risk related to COVID­19 as significantly worse than others. Older people (>60 years) perceived their mental health as significantly better than younger participants (p < 0.001). Most of the respondents assessed the adopted measures as adequate (71%) and believed in their effectiveness (69.7%).

In this paper, we present an example of a successfully implemented nature-based solution (NBS) in the Dijle valley in the centre of Belgium. The research objective is to retrospectively assess cost and benefit differences between a technical solution (storm basins) and an alternative NBS, here the restoration of the alluvial floodplain. The method is a comparative social cost-benefit analysis. The case study analysis reveals similar flood security, lower costs, more ecosystem services benefits and higher biodiversity values associated with the NBS option in comparison to the technical alternative. However, the business case for working with NBS depends substantially on the spatial and socio-ecological context. Chances for successful NBS implementation increase in conditions of sufficient space to retain flood water, when flood water is of sufficient quality, and when economic activity and housing in the floodplain is limited.","Turkelboom, Francis; Demeyer, Rolinde; Vranken, Liesbet; De Becker, Piet; Raymaekers, Filip; De Smet, Lieven",Ambio,,336

274935,Prevalence of depressive symptoms among Chinese pregnant and postpartum women during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Susceptibility to severe illness from COVID-19 is anticipated to be associated with cigarette smoking as it aggravates the risk of cardiovascular and respiratory illness, including infections. This is particularly important with the advent of a new strain of coronaviruses, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that has led to the present pandemic, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Although, the effects of smoking on COVID-19 are less described and controversial, we presume a link between smoking and COVID-19. Smoking has been shown to enhance the expression of the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) key entry genes utilized by SARS-CoV-2 to infect cells and induce a 'cytokine storm', which further increases the severity of COVID-19 clinical course. Nevertheless, the impact of smoking on ACE-2 and TMPRSS2 receptors expression remains paradoxical. Thus, further research is necessary to unravel the association between smoking and COVID-19 and to pursue the development of potential novel therapies that are able to constrain the morbidity and mortality provoked by this infectious disease. Herein we present a brief overview of the current knowledge on the correlation between smoking and the expression of SARS-CoV-2 key entry genes, clinical manifestations, and disease progression.","Gupta, Ishita; Sohail, Muhammad Umar; Elzawawi, Khaled E; Amarah, Ahmed H; Vranic, Semir; Al-Asmakh, Maha; Moustafa, Ala-Eddin Al",,,336

275848,Traumatic Stress in Healthcare Workers During COVID-19 Pandemic: A Review of the Immediate Impact,2020,"CONTEXT: Lymphopenia is a key feature of immune dysfunction in patients with bacterial sepsis and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and is associated with poor clinical outcomes, but the cause is largely unknown. Severely ill patients may present with thyroid function abnormalities, so-called nonthyroidal illness syndrome, and several studies have linked thyrotropin (thyroid stimulating hormone, TSH) and the thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4) and 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3) to homeostatic regulation and function of lymphocyte populations. OBJECTIVE: This work aimed to test the hypothesis that abnormal thyroid function correlates with lymphopenia in patients with severe infections. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of absolute lymphocyte counts, circulating TSH, T4, free T4 (FT4), T3, albumin, and inflammatory biomarkers was performed in 2 independent hospitalized study populations: bacterial sepsis (nâ =â 224) and COVID-19 patients (nâ =â 161). A subgroup analysis was performed in patients with severe lymphopenia and normal lymphocyte counts. RESULTS: Only T3 significantly correlated (&#961;â =â 0.252) with lymphocyte counts in patients with bacterial sepsis, and lower concentrations were found in severe lymphopenic compared to nonlymphopenic patients (nâ =â 56 per group). Severe lymphopenic COVID-19 patients (nâ =â 17) showed significantly lower plasma concentrations of TSH, T4, FT4, and T3 compared to patients without lymphopenia (nâ =â 18), and demonstrated significantly increased values of the inflammatory markers interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, and ferritin. Remarkably, after 1 week of follow-up, the majority (12 of 15) of COVID-19 patients showed quantitative recovery of their lymphocyte numbers, whereas TSH and thyroid hormones remained mainly disturbed. CONCLUSION: Abnormal thyroid function correlates with lymphopenia in patients with severe infections, like bacterial sepsis and COVID-19, but future studies need to establish whether a causal relationship is involved.","Grondman, Inge; de Nooijer, Aline H; Antonakos, Nikolaos; Janssen, Nico A F; Mouktaroudi, Maria; Leventogiannis, Konstantinos; Medici, Marco; Smit, Jan W A; van Herwaarden, Antonius E; Joosten, Leo A B; van de Veerdonk, Frank L; Pickkers, Peter; Kox, Matthijs; Jaeger, Martin; Netea, Mihai G; Giamarellos-Bourboulis, Evangelos J; Netea-Maier, Romana T",J Clin Endocrinol Metab,,336

There is a lack of evidence-based literature providing clinical and organizational guidelines for the management of a general surgery department. Aim of our study was to review the available recommendations published by general Surgery Societies and Health Institutions and evaluate the underlying Literature. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A review of the English Literature was conducted according to the AMSTAR and to the 2009 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. RESULTS: After eligibility assessment, a total of 22 papers and statements were analyzed. Surgical societies have established criteria for triage and prioritization in order to identify procedures that can be postponed after the pandemic and those that should not. Prioritization among oncologic cases represents a difficult task: clinicians have to balance a possible delay in cancer diagnosis or treatment against the risk for a potential COVID-19 exposure. There is broad agreement among guidelines that indication to proceed with surgery should be discussed in virtual Tumor Boards taking into consideration alternative therapeutic approaches. Several guidelines deal with the role of laparoscopic surgery during the pandemic: a tailored approach is currently suggested, with a case-by-case evaluation provided that appropriate personal protective equipment is available in order to minimize the potential risk of transmission. Finally, there is a considerable agreement in the published Literature concerning the management of the personnel during the peri- and intraoperative phase and on the technical advices regarding the induction, operative and recover maneuvers in COVID-19 cases. CONCLUSIONS: During COVID-19 pandemic, it is of paramount importance to face the emergency in the most effective and efficient manner, retrieving resources from non-essential settings and, at the same time, providing care to high priority non-COVID-19 related diseases.","Moletta, Lucia; Pierobon, Elisa Sefora; Capovilla, Giovanni; Costantini, Mario; Salvador, Renato; Merigliano, Stefano; Valmasoni, Michele",Int J Surg,,336

METHODS: All members of the Italian Society of Digestive Endoscopy (SIED) were invited to participate to a questionnaire-based survey during the first months of the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy. RESULTS: 314/1306 (24%) SIED members accounting for 201/502 (40%) endoscopic centers completed the survey. Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) were available in most centers, but filtering face-piece masks (FFP2 or FFP3) and negative pressure room were not in 10.9 and 75.1%. Training courses on PPE use were provided in 57.2% of centers only; there was at least one positive HCW in 17.4% of centers globally, 107/3308 (3.2%) HCWs were diagnosed with COVID-19 with similar rates of physicians (2.9%), nurses (3.5%) and other health operators (3.5%). Involvement in a COVID-19 care team (OR: 4.96) and the lack of training courses for PPE, (OR: 2.65) were associated with increased risk. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of COVID-19 among endoscopy HCWs was not negligible and was associated with work in a COVID-19 care team and lack of education on proper PPE use. These data deserve attention during the subsequent waves.","Mariani, Alberto; Capurso, Gabriele; Marasco, Giovanni; Bertani, Helga; Crinò, Stefano Francesco; Magarotto, Andrea; Tringali, Andrea; Pasquale, Luigi; Arcidiacono, Paolo Giorgio; Zagari, Rocco Maurizio",Dig Liver Dis,,336
280223,Key Factors Promoting Rapid Implementation of Virtual Screening Modalities for the COVID-19 Pandemic Response,2021,"Sequence-to-sequence models provide a viable new approach to generative summarization, allowing models that are no longer limited to simply selecting and recombining sentences from the original text. However, these models have three drawbacks: their grasp of the details of the original text is often inaccurate, and the text generated by such models often has repetitions, while it is difficult to handle words that are beyond the word list. In this paper, we propose a new architecture that combines reinforcement learning and adversarial generative networks to enhance the sequence-to-sequence attention model. First, we use a hybrid pointer-generator network that copies words directly from the source text, contributing to accurate reproduction of information without sacrificing the ability of generators to generate new words. Second, we use both intra-temporal and intra-decoder attention to penalize summarized content and thus discourage repetition. We apply our model to our own proposed COVID-19 paper title summarization task and achieve close approximations to the current model on ROUEG, while bringing better readability.","Xu, Tianyang; Zhang, Chunyun",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.15176v2.pdf,336

This study used the fragment molecular orbital (FMO) method to analyze the interactions between RBD and antibodies/peptides and extracted crucial residues that can be used to epitopes. The interactions evaluated as inter-fragment interaction energy (IFIE) values between the RBD and 12 antibodies/peptides showed a fairly good correlation with the experimental activity pIC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.540).

This study analyses the impacts of the pandemic to the shopping behaviour and identifies, among the respondents, who have changed the behaviour the most, how respondents have adopted different shopping strategies, what the main differences between Italian and Swedish responses are and the influence of population density on the behavioural change. Multivariate statistical analyses, including linear and binary logistic regressions and multinomial logit models were used to analyse the dataset. The results confirm the differences between Italy and Sweden in terms of social distancing measures, social structures and technology readiness. Moreover, the socio-demographic and household structures of the respondents were found instrumental in influencing the amount and the direction of change in shopping behaviour during the first wave of the pandemic period.

Political bias in social media has been studied in multiple viewpoints like media bias, political ideology, echo chambers, and controversies using machine learning pipelines. Most of the current methods rely heavily on the manually-labeled ground-truth data for the underlying political bias prediction tasks. Limitations of such methods include human-intensive labeling, labels related to only a specific problem, and the inability to determine the near future bias state of a social media conversation. In this work, we address such problems and give machine learning approaches to study political bias in two ideologically diverse social media forums: Gab and Twitter without the availability of human-annotated data.

We seek to elucidate changes in abdominal imaging ordered from the emergency department (ED) in a healthcare system undergoing non-surge conditions in April 2020 compared to April 2019. METHODS: We performed a retrospective, observational study comparing patients undergoing CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis ordered from the ED in April 2020 vs. April 2019 at a single healthcare center. Via review of the radiology report and electronic medical record, we determined the positive or negative status of these scans. We evaluated percentages of positive CT scans and differences in outcomes, including admission rates, interventions, and mortality. RESULTS: Comparing 2020 to 2019, there was a 31.6% decrease in the number of CT scans performed from the ED. We found a higher percentage of positive CT findings, 58.2% vs. 50.8% (p = 0.025), and increased admission rates, 40.8% vs. 34.1% (p = 0.036). Differences were found in rates of appendicitis, colitis, and cholangitis. No difference was found in ICU admissions, interventions, or in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic in a region undergoing non-surge conditions, we found increased rates of positive CT scans performed from the ED for abdominal complaints with an increased percentage of hospital admissions compared to a control year. No differences in ICU admissions or rates of procedural intervention were found to suggest higher acuity of pathology on presentation. Our findings suggest appropriately decreased healthcare utilization in our study period, driven by pre-hospital patient self-selection.","Griffith, April M; Ockerse, Patrick; Shaaban, Akram; Kelly, Christopher",Emerg. radiol,,336

287731,Psychological Distress and Trauma in Doctors Providing Frontline Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United Kingdom and Ireland: A Prospective Longitudinal Survey Cohort Study (preprint),2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is stretching medical resources internationally, sometimes creating ventilator shortages that complicate clinical and ethical situations. The possibility of needing to ventilate multiple patients with a single ventilator raises patient health and safety concerns in addition to clinical conditions needing treatment. Wherever ventilators are employed, additional tubing and splitting adaptors may be available. Adjustable flow-compensating resistance for differences in lung compliance on individual limbs may not be readily implementable. By exploring a number and range of possible contributing factors using computational simulation without risk of patient harm, this paper attempts to define useful bounds for ventilation parameters when compensatory resistance in limbs of a shared breathing circuit is not possible. This desperate approach to shared ventilation support would be a last resort when alternatives have been exhausted. METHODS: A whole-body computational physiology model (using lumped parameters) was used to simulate each patient being ventilated. The primary model of a single patient with a dedicated ventilator was augmented to model two patients sharing a single ventilator. In addition to lung mechanics or estimation of CO2 and pH expected for set ventilation parameters (considerations of lung physiology alone), full physiological simulation provides estimates of additional values for oxyhemoglobin saturation, arterial oxygen tension, and other patient parameters. A range of ventilator settings and patient characteristics were simulated for paired patients. FINDINGS: To be useful for clinicians, attention has been directed to clinically available parameters. These simulations show patient outcome during multi-patient ventilation is most closely correlated to lung compliance, oxygenation index, oxygen saturation index, and end-tidal carbon dioxide of individual patients. The simulated patient outcome metrics were satisfactory when the lung compliance difference between two patients was less than 12 mL/cmH2O, and the oxygen saturation index difference was less than 2 mmHg. INTERPRETATION: In resource-limited regions of the world, the COVID-19 pandemic will result in equipment shortages. While single-patient ventilation is preferable, if that option is unavailable and ventilator sharing using limbs without flow resistance compensation is the only available alternative, these simulations provide a conceptual framework and guidelines for clinical patient selection.","Webb, Jeffrey B; Bray, Aaron; Asare, Philip K; Clipp, Rachel B; Mehta, Yatin B; Penupolu, Sudheer; Patel, Aalpen A; Poler, S Mark",PLoS One,,336
288223,COVID-19 Pandemic: The Lived Experiences of Older Adults in Aged Care Homes,2020,"Objective: The majority of patients with COVID-19 showed mild symptoms. However, approximately 5% of them were critically ill and require intensive care unit admission for advanced life supports. Patients in the intensive care unit were high risk for venous thromboembolism and hemorrhage due to the immobility and anticoagulants used during advanced life supports. The aim of the study was to report the incidence and treatments of the two complications in such patients. Method: Patients with COVID-19 (Group 1) and patients with community-acquired pneumonia (Group 2) that required intensive care unit admission were enrolled in this retrospective study. Their demographics, laboratory results, ultrasound findings and complications such as venous thromboembolism and hemorrhage were collected and compared. Results: Thirty-four patients with COVID-19 and 51 patients with community-acquired pneumonia were included. The mean ages were 66 and 63 years in Groups 1 and 2, respectively. Venous thromboembolism was detected in 6 (18%) patients with COVID-19 and 18 (35%) patients with community-acquired pneumonia (P = 0.09). The major type was distal deep venous thrombosis. Twenty-one bleeding events occurred in 12 (35%) patients with COVID-19 and 5 bleeding events occurred in 5 (10%) patients with community-acquired pneumonia, respectively (P = 0.01). Gastrointestinal system was the most common source of bleeding. With the exception of one death due to intracranial bleeding, blood transfusion with or without surgical/endoscopic treatments was able to manage the bleeding in the remaining patients. Multivariable logistic regression showed increasing odds of hemorrhage with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (odds ratio: 13.9, 95% confidence interval: 4.0-48.1) and COVID-19 (odds ratio: 4.7, 95% confidence interval: 1.2-17.9). Conclusion: Venous thromboembolism and hemorrhage were common in both groups. The predominant type of venous thromboembolism was distal deep venous thrombosis, which presented a low risk of progression. COVID-19 and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation were risk factors for hemorrhage. Blood transfusion with or without surgical/endoscopic treatments was able to manage it in most cases.","Qiu, C.; Li, T.; Wei, G.; Xu, J.; Yu, W.; Wu, Z.; Li, D.; He, Y.; Chen, T.; Zhang, J.; He, X.; Hu, J.; Fang, J.; Zhang, H.",SAGE Open Medicine,,336

METHODS: The 1-month follow-up data included clinical manifestations and results from serum severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) IgG and IgM tests, reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2, lung computed tomography (CT) scans, and laboratory tests. RESULTS: Between January 20 and March 15, 2020, 127 patients aged 0-15 years were hospitalized for COVID-19 treatment, including 3 severe cases and 124 mild or moderate cases. The main therapies included inhalation of aerosolized interferon-&#945; (122/127) and additional antiviral drugs (28/127). Among the 81 patients who had pneumonia at admission, 35 with right lobe pneumonia had the longest hospital stay (mean 14.5 ± 7 days); 17 with left lobe pneumonia had the highest creatine kinase (154 ± 106 U/L) and creatine kinase myocardial band (CK-MB, 43 ± 48 U/L) levels; and 29 with bilateral pneumonia had the highest white blood cell counts (8.3 ± 4 × 109 /L). Among the 46 patients who were successfully followed up 1 month after discharge, two notable findings were right lobe pneumonia in 22% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 11%-37%) of patients and persistently elevated serum creatine kinase and CK-MB levels.

METHODS: We followed 210 test-positive and 630 test-negative health-care workers of the Central Denmark Region up to 90 days after the test, April-June 2020. They daily reported COVID-19 related symptoms that were compared graphically and by logistic regression. RESULTS: Thirty % of test-positive and close to zero of test-negative participants reported reduced sense of taste and smell during all 90 days (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 86.07, 95% CI 22.86-323). Dyspnoea was reported by an initial 20% of test-positive declining to 5% after 30 days without ever reaching the level of the test-negative participants (aOR 6.88, 95% CI 2.41-19.63). Cough, headache, sore throat, muscle pain, and fever were temporarily more prevalent among the test positive participants; after 30 days, no increases were seen. Women and older participants were more susceptible to COVID-19 symptoms. CONCLUSION: Prevalence of long-lasting reduced sense of taste and smell is highly increased in mild COVID-19 patients.

289602,Before and after the Quarantine: An Approximate Study on the Psychological Impact of COVID-19 on the Italian Population during the Lockdown Period,2020,"BACKGROUND: More than 50% of Africa's population lives in rural areas, which have few professional health workers. South Africa has adopted task shifting health care to Community Health Workers (CHWs) to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, but little is known about CHWs' efficacy in rural areas. METHODS: In this longitudinal prospective cohort study, almost all mothers giving birth (N = 470) in the Zithulele Hospital catchment area of the OR Tambo District were recruited and repeatedly assessed for 2 years after birth with 84.7-96% follow-up rates. During the cohort assessment we found that some mothers had received standard antenatal and HIV care (SC) (n = 313 mothers), while others had received SC, supplemented with home-visiting by CHWs before and after birth (HV) (n = 157 mothers, 37 CHWs). These visits were unrelated to the cohort study. Multiple linear and logistic regressions evaluated maternal comorbidities, maternal caretaking, and child development outcomes over time. RESULTS: Compared to mothers receiving SC, mothers who also received home visits by CHWs were more likely to attend the recommended four antenatal care visits, to exclusively breastfeed at 3 months, and were less likely to consult traditional healers at 3 months. Mothers in both groups were equally likely to secure the child grant, and infant growth and achievement of developmental milestones were similar over the first 2 years of life.

289942,Experiences and Needs of Caregivers of Persons With Dementia in India During the COVID-19 Pandemic-A Qualitative Study,2020,"In recent years, a number of epidemiological studies have demonstrated that exposure to air pollution is associated with several adverse outcomes, such as acute lower respiratory infections, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, cardiovascular diseases, and lung cancer among other serious diseases. Air pollutants such as sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide and dioxide, particulate matter (PM), ozone and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are commonly found at high levels in big cities and/or in the vicinity of different chemical industries. An association between air concentrations of these pollutants and human respiratory viruses interacting to adversely affect the respiratory system has been also reported. The present review was aimed at assessing the potential relationship between the concentrations of air pollutants on the airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and the severity of COVID-19 in patients infected by this coronavirus. The results of most studies here reviewed suggest that chronic exposure to certain air pollutants leads to more severe and lethal forms of COVID-19 and delays/complicates the recovery of patients of this disease.","Domingo, José L; Marquès, Montse; Rovira, Joaquim",Environ Res,,336
290918,Electroconvulsive Therapy and Triaging During Reduced Access and the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Personal Perspective,2020,"BackgroundPatients with cancer are at risk for poor COVID-19 outcomes. We aimed to identify cancer-related risk factors for poor COVID-19 outcomes. Patients and MethodsWe conducted a retrospective cohort study using the University of California Health COVID Research Data Set. This database includes prospectively-collected, electronic health data of patients who underwent testing for SARS-CoV-2 at seventeen California medical centers. We identified adult patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 between February 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020, and selected a cohort of patients with cancer using diagnostic codes. We obtained demographic, comorbidity, laboratory, cancer type, and antineoplastic therapy data. The primary outcome was hospitalization within 30 days after first positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Secondary outcomes were SARS-CoV-2 positivity and composite endpoint for severe COVID-19 (intensive care, mechanical ventilation, or death within 30 days after first positive test). We used multivariable logistic regression to identify cancer-related factors associated with outcomes. ResultsWe identified 409,462 patients undergoing SARS-CoV-2 testing. Of 49,918 patients with cancer, 1,781 (3.6%) tested positive. Patients with cancer were less likely to test positive (OR 0.69, 95%CI 0.66-0.73, P<0.001). BCR-ABL-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and primary myelofibrosis) (OR 2.51, 95%CI 1.29-4.89, P=0.007); venetoclax (OR 3.63, 95%CI 1.02-12.92, P=0.046); methotrexate (OR 3.65, 95%CI 1.17-11.37, P=0.026); Asian race (OR 1.92, 95%CI 1.23-2.98, P=0.004); and Hispanic/Latino ethnicity (OR 1.96, 95%CI 1.41-2.73, P<0.001) were associated with increased hospitalization risk. Among 388 hospitalized patients with cancer and COVID-19, cancer type and therapy type were not associated with severe COVID-19. ConclusionsIn this large, diverse cohort of Californians, cancer was not a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Patients with BCR/ABL-negative myeloproliferative neoplasm and patients receiving methotrexate or venetoclax may be at an increased risk of hospitalization following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further mechanistic and comparative studies are needed to explain and confirm our findings.","Kwon, Daniel H; Pico, Jose Eduardo Cadena; Nguyen, Sam; Chan, Kwan Ho Ryan; Soper, Brian; Gryshuk, Amy; Ray, Priyadip H; Huang, Franklin W",,,336
290919,Electroconvulsive Therapy and Triaging During Reduced Access and the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Personal Perspective,2020,"Dried blood spots (DBS) are routinely used in screening newborns for treatable disorders. Immunoglobulin extraction from DBS, serum or other biological fluids loaded on filter paper cards could represent a valuable method of specimen preservation in monitoring immune response against pathogens as well as vaccination efficiency. In this study using different sources including serum, and monoclonal antibodies we established parameters for antibody extraction from the filter cards to assess antibody reactivity against Helicobacter pylori, measles virus (MV) and the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 antigens. We demonstrated that DBS and dried undiluted serum result in completely preserved antibody activity for immunoassays, including in virus neutralization assays against MV. Extraction efficiency was determined by IgG concentration measurements. The plaque-reduction neutralization titer 50% of dried human serum spots remained stable after more than 10-day storage - 1:359 vs. 1:345 for the corresponding frozen sample. DBSs could be used to monitor immune response to bacterial and viral antigens following natural exposure or immunization. Mice immunized with recombinant spike protein receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 developed a strong antibody response by day 14 and reached titers above 1:64,000 on day 21 following the secondary boost immunization as measured on DBS samples in antigen-mediated ELISA. Variability in IgG concentration of eluted DBS could be influenced by factors involved in sample application, extraction process and sample characteristics. Adjustment of antibody specific activity to the eluted IgG concentration can increase accuracy of the result interpretation, including in SARS-CoV-2 serological diagnostics.","Iankov, Ianko; Viker, Kimberly; Turgeon, Coleman; Matern, Dietrich; Galanis, Evanthia",J Immunol Methods,,336
291332,Altered alcohol consumption during COVID-19 pandemic lockdown,2021,"IntroductionTo better assess the epidemiological situation of acute respiratory illness in Germany over time, we used emergency department data for syndromic surveillance before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. MethodsWe included routine attendance data from emergency departments who continuously transferred data between week 10-2017 and 10-2021, with ICD-10 codes available for >75% of the attendances. Case definitions for acute respiratory illness (ARI), severe ARI (SARI), influenza-like illness (ILI), respiratory syncytial virus disease (RSV) and Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were based on a combination of ICD-10 codes, and/or chief complaints, sometimes combined with information on hospitalisation and age. ResultsWe included 1,372,958 attendances from eight emergency departments. The number of attendances dropped in March 2020, increased during summer, and declined again during the resurge of COVID-19 cases in autumn and winter of 2020/2021. A pattern of seasonality of acute respiratory infections could be observed. By using different case definitions (i.e. for ARI, SARI, ILI, RSV) both the annual influenza seasons in the years 2017-2020 and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020-2021 were apparent. The absence of a flu season during the fall and winter of 2020/2021 was visible, in parallel to the resurge of COVID-19 cases. The proportion of SARI among ARI cases peaked in April-May 2020 and November 2020-January 2021. ConclusionSyndromic surveillance using routine emergency department data has the potential to monitor the trends, timing, duration, magnitude and severity of illness caused by respiratory viruses, including both influenza and SARS-CoV-2.","Boender, T Sonia; Cai, Wei; Schranz, Madlen; Kocher, Theresa; Wagner, Birte; Ullrich, Alexander; Buda, Silke; Zoellner, Rebecca; Greiner, Felix; Diercke, Michaela; Grabenhenrich, Linus",,,336

An evaluation of the current service,2021,"AIMS: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a widespread pandemic with an increased morbidity and mortality, especially for patients with cardiovascular diseases. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as necessary cell entry point for SARS-CoV-2. Previous animal studies have demonstrated an increased ACE2 expression following treatment with either angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) that have led to a massive precariousness regarding the optimal cardiovascular therapy during this pandemic. METHODS AND RESULTS: We have measured ACE2 mRNA expression using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction in atrial biopsies of 81 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting and we compared 62 patients that received ACEi/ARB vs. 19 patients that were not ACEi/ARB-treated. We found atrial ACE2 mRNA expression to be significantly increased in patients treated with an ACEi or an ARB, independent of potential confounding comorbidities. Interestingly, the cardiac ACE2 mRNA expression correlated significantly with the expression in white blood cells of 22 patients encouraging further evaluation if the latter may be used as a surrogate for the former. Similarly, analysis of 18 ventricular biopsies revealed a significant and independent increase in ACE2 mRNA expression in patients with end-stage heart failure that were treated with ACEi/ARB. On the other hand, cardiac unloading with a left ventricular assist device significantly reduced ventricular ACE2 mRNA expression. CONCLUSION: Treatment with ACEi/ARB is independently associated with an increased myocardial ACE2 mRNA expression in patients with coronary artery disease and in patients with end-stage heart failure. Further trials are needed to test whether this association is deleterious for patients with COVID-19, or possibly protective. Nevertheless, haemodynamic factors seem to be equally important for regulation of cardiac ACE2 mRNA expression.","Lebek, Simon; Tafelmeier, Maria; Messmann, Rebecca; Provaznik, Zdenek; Schmid, Christof; Maier, Lars S; Birner, Christoph; Arzt, Michael; Wagner, Stefan",Eur. j. heart fail,,336

We assume that people move around in a city of 120x120 blocks with 300 inhabitants in each block. The mobility pattern is associated to a complex network in which nodes represent blocks while the links represent the traveling path of the individuals. We implemented three confinement strategies in order to mitigate the disease spreading: 1) global confinement, 2) partial restriction to mobility, and 3) localized confinement. In the first case, it was observed that a global isolation policy prevents the massive outbreak of the disease. In the second case, a partial restriction to mobility could lead to a massive contagion if this was not complemented with sanitary measures such as the use of masks and social distancing. Finally, a local isolation policy was proposed, conditioned to the health status of each block. It was observed that this mitigation strategy was able to contain and even reduce the outbreak of the disease by intervening in specific regions of the city according to their level of contagion. It was also observed that this strategy is capable of controlling the epidemic in the case that a certain proportion of those infected are asymptomatic.","Cornes, Fernando E.; Frank, Guillermo A.; Dorso, Claudio O.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.02294v1.pdf,336

We sought to determine whether IgG, IgA and neutralizing antibody (nAb) to SARS-CoV-2 vary by ABO blood group. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Among eligible convalescent plasma donors, ABO blood group was determined via agglutination of reagent A1 and B cells, IgA and IgG were quantified using the Euroimmun anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA, and nAb titres were quantified using a microneutralization assay. Differences in titre distribution were examined by ABO blood group using non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis tests. Adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) of high nAb titre (&#8805;1:160) were estimated by blood group using multivariable modified Poisson regression models that adjusted for age, sex, hospitalization status and time since SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. RESULTS: Of the 202 potential donors, 65 (32%) were blood group A, 39 (19%) were group B, 13 (6%) were group AB, and 85 (42%) were group O. Distribution of nAb titres significantly differed by ABO blood group, whereas there were no significant differences in anti-spike IgA or anti-spike IgG titres by ABO blood group. There were significantly more individuals with high nAb titre (&#8805;1:160) among those with blood group B, compared with group O (aPR = 1·9 [95%CI = 1·1-3·3], P = 0·029). Fewer individuals had a high nAb titre among those with blood group A, compared with group B (aPR = 0·6 [95%CI = 0·4-1·0], P = 0·053).

METHODS: Concentrations of lopinavir/ritonavir were assayed by an accredited LC-MS/MS method. The population pharmacokinetics of lopinavir was described using non-linear mixed-effects modeling (NONMEM version 7.4). After determination of the base model that better described the data set, the influence of covariates (age, body weight, height, body mass index (BMI), gender, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), C reactive protein (CRP), and trough ritonavir concentrations) was tested on the model. RESULTS: From 13 hospitalized patients (4 females, 9 males, age = 64 ± 16 years), 70 lopinavir/ritonavir plasma concentrations were available for analysis. The data were best described by a one-compartment model with a first-order input (KA). Among the covariates tested on the PK parameters, only the ritonavir trough concentrations had a significant effect on CL/F and improved the fit. Model-based simulations with the final parameter estimates under a regimen lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg b.i.d. showed a high variability with median concentration between 20 and 30 mg/L (Cmin/Cmax) and the 90% prediction intervals within the range 1-100 mg/L. CONCLUSION: According to the estimated 50% effective concentration of lopinavir against SARS-CoV-2 virus in Vero E6 cells (16.7 mg/L), our model showed that at steady state, a dose of 400 mg b.i.d. led to 40% of patients below the minimum effective concentration while a dose of 1200 mg b.i.d. will reduce this proportion to 22%.","Alvarez, Jean Claude; Moine, Pierre; Davido, Benjamin; Etting, Isabelle; Annane, Djillali; Larabi, Islam Amine; Simon, Nicolas",Eur. j. clin. pharmacol,,336

These sudden shifts bring up questions about the long-term effects of COVID-19 on already fragile rural health care systems and the ability of rural populations, including farmers and farm workers, to meet their health care needs. To provide alternative and safe access to health care, the Federal government relaxed telehealth regulations, which effectively removed some of the largest regulatory barriers that had limited the adoption of telehealth in the U.S. In this commentary, we draw on the example of the Marshfield Clinic Health System (MCHS), a large rural health care system in Wisconsin and provide an early assessment of how it adjusted its telehealth services during the early months of COVID-19. While the long-term effects of the pandemic on rural health care systems will not be known for some time, the example of MCHS points to the importance of on-going and sustained investments to support the resilience of health care systems and their ability to weather crises. With early evidence that MCHS patients and practitioners are interested in continuing to use telehealth post-COVID-19, we conclude our commentary by offering three recommendations to remove hurdles and improve quality of telehealth care.","Meyer, Chris; Becot, Florence; Burke, Rick; Weichelt, Bryan",J Agromedicine,,336
297470,Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Adverse Neuropsychiatric Outcomes After Trauma Exposure,2021,"First in 2002, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), second in 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and now the third in the December 2019, emergence of tremendously pathogenic and large-scale epidemic novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has brought the worst conditions into the human inhabitants of the twenty-first century. The SARS-CoV-2 uses the resembling receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as that for SARS-CoV, and mainly feasts through the respiratory tract. The ACE2 receptor appearances have been also detected upon glial cells and neurons, which makes them a potential target of SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19). Consequently, cells expressing ACE2, apart from lung and cardiovascular tissue, neurons and glial cells may act as targets and are thus vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 systemic infection as well as its central nervous system (CNS) comorbidities. Investigation of the neurological manifestations of COVID-19 is a step towards better understanding the SARS-CoV-2 infections, inhibiting the additional spread and treating patients affected by this pandemic. In this concern, more clinical examinations for CNS involvement of SARS-CoV-2 are warranted. In this article, we have reviewed the neurological characteristic features of COVID-19 patients, latent neurotropic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 involvement in the comorbidity associated with CNS disorders, and neurological manifestations associated with COVID-19. Therefore, in the perspective of COVID-19 pandemic, clinicians and healthcare workers should be aware of a wide spectrum of neurological manifestations associated with COVID-19 along with their signs and symptoms for initial diagnosis and isolation of the patients.","Kumar, Mukesh; Thakur, Ajit Kumar",Neurol Sci,,336

298312,Virtual reality exercise as a coping strategy for health and wellness promotion in older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly contagious virus that infects humans and a number of animal species causing coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), a respiratory distress syndrome which has provoked a global pandemic and a serious health crisis in most countries across our planet. COVID-19 inflammation is mediated by IL-1, a disease that can cause symptoms such as fever, cough, lung inflammation, thrombosis, stroke, renal failure and headache, to name a few. Strategies that inhibit IL-1 are certainly helpful in COVID-19 and can represent one of the therapeutic options. However, until now, COVID-19 therapy has been scarce and, in many cases, ineffective, since there are no specific drugs other than the vaccine that can solve this serious health problem. Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines which are the newest approach, are already available and will certainly meet the many expectations that the population is waiting for. mRNA vaccines, coated with protected soft fatty lipids, use genetic mRNA (plus various inactive excipients) to make a piece of the coronavirus spike protein, which will instruct the immune system to produce specific antibodies. The soft fatty lipids allow the entry of mRNA into cells where it is absorbed into the cytoplasm and initiates the synthesis of the spike protein. In addition, vaccination also activates T cells that help the immune system respond to further exposure to the coronavirus. mRNA induces the synthesis of antigens of SARS-CoV-2 virus which stimulate the antibody response of the vaccinated person with the production of neutralizing antibodies. The new variant of the coronavirus-19 has been detected in the UK where, at the moment, the London government has imposed a lockdown with restrictions on international movements. The virus variant had already infected 1/4 of the total cases and in December 2020, it reached 2/3 of those infected in the UK. It has been noted that the spreading rate of the British variant could be greater than 70% of cases compared to the normal SARS-CoV-2 virus, with an R index growth of 0.4. Recent studies suggest that coronavirus-19 variation occurs at the level N501Y of the spike protein and involves 23 separate mutations on the spike, 17 of which are linked to the virus proteins, thus giving specific characteristics to the virus. In general, coronaviruses undergo many mutations that are often not decisive for their biological behavior and does not significantly alter the structure and the components of the virus. This phenomenon also occurs in SARS-CoV-2. It is highly probable that the variants recently described in the UK will not hinder vaccine-induced immunity. In fact, the variant will not break the vaccine although it may have some chance of making it a little less effective. Therefore, it is pertinent to think that the vaccine will work against the SARS-CoV-2 variant as well. In today's pandemic, the D614G mutation of the amino acid of corronavirus-19, which emerged in Europe in February 2020 is the most frequent form and causes high viral growth. The previously infrequent D614G mutation is now globally dominant. This variant, which is being tested by many international laboratories, is rapidly spreading across the countries and a series of vaccinated subjects are testing to see if their antibodies can neutralize the new variant of SARS-CoV-2. This variant has a very high viral growth and is less detectable with the RT-PCR technique in the laboratory. It has been reported that the British variant that increases viral load does not cause more severe effects in the respiratory tract and lung disease, therefore, it is certain that the variant is growing rapidly and must be kept under control; for this reason, laboratory data is expected impatiently. The study on the many variants that coronavirus-19 presents is very interesting and complete and clearer data on this topic will be ready in the near future. In addition, it is still unclear whether the different variants discovered in many countries, including Africa, share the same spike protein mutation and therefore, this is another study to elaborate on. In order to be certain and to not have unexpected surprises, we need to reduce the spread and the transmission speed of viral variants that could appear around the world, creating new pandemics. For this reason, the scientific community is on the alert since laboratory tests on serum antibodies from COVID-19 survivors have been reported to be less effective in attacking the variant. In light of the above, the scientific community must be on the alert as larger variants of the spike protein could escape vaccine-induced antibodies, which for now are of great help to the community and can save millions of lives. Deepening the study of spike protein mutations will help to better understand how to combat coronavirus-19 and its variants.","Conti, P; Caraffa, Al; Gallenga, C E; Kritas, S K; Frydas, I; Younes, A; Di Emidio, P; Tetè, G; Pregliasco, F; Ronconi, G",J. biol. regul. homeost. agents,,336

298358,"COVID-19 Infections Among Healthcare Personnel in the United States Veterans Health Administration, March - August, 2020",2020,"BACKGROUND: We used online crowdsourcing to explore public perceptions and attitudes towards virtual orthopaedic care, and to identify factors associated with perceived difficulty navigating telehealth services during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A modified version of the validated Telemedicine Satisfaction and Usefulness Questionnaire was completed by 816 individuals using crowd-sourcing methods. Multivariable logistic regression modelling was used to determine population characteristics associated with perceived difficulty using telehealth technology. RESULTS: Most respondents (85%) believed that telehealth visits would be a convenient form of healthcare delivery, and 64% would prefer them over in-person office visits. The majority (92%) agreed that telehealth would save them time, but 81% had concerns regarding the lack of physical contact during a musculoskeletal examination. More respondents would feel comfortable using telehealth for routine follow-up care (81%) compared to initial assessment visits (59%) and first postoperative appointments (60%). Roughly 1 in 15 (7%) expressed difficulty with using telehealth; these respondents were more often unmarried, lower-income, and more medically infirm, and reported greater symptoms of depression. After multivariable adjustment, lower income and poor health were retained as predictors of difficulty with navigating telehealth technology (pâ¯=â¯0.027,pâ¯=â¯0.036, respectively). CONCLUSION: The majority of the public appears receptive to telehealth for orthopaedic care for both new patient visits and follow-up appointments. The finding that people with multiple chronic conditions and psychosocial needs struggle to engage with telehealth suggests that those who arguably stand to benefit the most from continued care are the ones being unintentionally left out of this digitization boom.","Puzzitiello, Richard N; Moverman, Michael A; Pagani, Nicholas R; Ryan, Scott P; Salzler, Matthew J; Jawa, Andrew; Menendez, Mariano E",J. natl. med. assoc,,336

Based on steadily evolved clinical, histological and immunopathological features and some autoantibody associations, these disorders can now be classified in five characteristic subsets: Dermatomyositis (DM) Polymyositis (PM), Necrotizing Autoimmune Myositis (NAM), Anti-synthetase syndrome-overlap myositis (Anti-SS-OM), and Inclusion-Body-Myositis (IBM). Each inflammatory myopathy subset has distinct immunopathogenesis, prognosis and response to immunotherapies, necessitating the need to correctly identify each subtype from the outset to avoid disease mimics and proceed to early therapy initiation. The review presents the main clinicopathologic characteristics of each subset highlighting the importance of combining expertise in clinical neurological examination with muscle morphology and immunopathology to avoid erroneous diagnoses and therapeutic schemes. The main autoimmune markers related to autoreactive T cells, B cells, autoantibodies and cytokines are presented and the concomitant myodegenerative features seen in IBM muscles are pointed out. Most importantly, unsettled issues related to a role of autoantibodies and controversies with reference to possible triggering factors related to statins are clarified. The emerging effect SARS-CoV-2 as the cause of hyperCKemia and potentially NAM is addressed and practical guidelines on the best therapeutic approaches and concerns regarding immunotherapies during COVID-19 pandemic are summarized.","Dalakas, Marinos C",Acta Myol,,336

To the best of our knowledge, there is not any embracing published review about the use of psychotropic drugs during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Non-systematic literature review. A search in the PubMed database was performed, with the terms 'psychotropic drugs', 'COVID-19', 'psychiatry' and 'pandemic'. Consensus and clinical guidelines about psychotropic drugs and COVID-19 approach, published by scientific societies, governmental entities and drug regulatory agencies were included. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: We present the recommendations about the use of psychotropic drugs during the COVID-19 pandemic, in the outpatient and inpatient settings. The treatment of affective bipolar disorder and schizophrenia have now added increased difficulties. Some psychotropic drugs interfere with the pathophysiology of the novel coronavirus infection and they could interact with the drugs used in the treatment of COVID-19. Some patients will need pharmacological interventions due to the presence of delirium. Smoking cessation changes the serum levels of some psychotropic drugs and may influence their use. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has created new challenges in clinical practice. Psychiatric patients are a vulnerable population and often a careful clinical, laboratorial and electrocardiographic evaluation may be needed, particularly in those diagnosed with COVID-19. The regular treatment of mentally ill patients with COVID-19 presents increased complexity.","Andrade, Gabriela; Simões do Couto, Frederico; Câmara-Pestana, Luis",Acta med. port,,336

305498,Do pre-existing anxiety-related and mood disorders differentially impact COVID-19 stress responses and coping?,2020,"We have previously reported the fabrication of a polycaprolactone and hydroxyapatite composite scaffold incorporating growth factors to be used for bone regeneration. Two growth factors were incorporated employing a multilayered coating based on polydopamine (PDA). In particular, Bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) was bound onto the inner PDA layer while vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was immobilized onto the outer one. Herein, the in vitro release of both growth factors is evaluated. A fastest VEGF delivery followed by a slow and more sustained release of BMP-2 was demonstrated, thus fitting the needs for bone tissue engineering applications. Due to the relevance of the crosstalk between bone-promoting and vessel-forming cells during bone healing, the functionalized scaffolds are further assessed on a co-culture setup of human mesenchymal stem cells and human endothelial progenitor cells. Osteogenic and angiogenic gene expression analysis indicates a synergistic effect between the growth factor-loaded scaffolds and the co-culture conditions. Taken together, these results indicate that the developed scaffolds hold great potential as an efficient platform for bone-tissue applications.","Godoy-Gallardo, Maria; Portolés-Gil, Núria; López-Periago, Ana M; Domingo, Concepción; Hosta-Rigau, Leticia",,,336

In this paper, we propose a game-theoretic approach to schedule PPE orders among healthcare facilities. In this PPE game, each independent healthcare facility optimises its own storage utilisation in order to keep its PPE cost at a minimum. Such a model can reduce peak demand considerably when applied to a variable PPE consumption profile. Experiments conducted for NHS England regions using actual data confirm that the challenge of securing PPE supply during disasters such as COVID-19 can be eased if proper stock management procedures are adopted. These procedures can include early stockpiling, increasing storage capacities and implementing measures that can prolong the time period between successive infection waves, such as social distancing measures. Simulation results suggest that the provision of PPE dedicated storage space can be a viable solution to avoid straining PPE supply chains in case a second wave of COVID-19 infections occurs.","Abedrabboh, Khaled; Pilz, Matthias; Al-Fagih, Zaid; Al-Fagih, Othman S; Nebel, Jean-Christophe; Al-Fagih, Luluwah",PLoS One,,336

In this research, the authors tested interactions between adaptive and maladaptive narcissism using two motor tasks (basketball and golf in Experiments 1 and 2, respectively) and a cognitive task (letter transformation in Experiment 3). Across all experiments, adaptive narcissism predicted performance under pressure only when maladaptive narcissism was high. In the presence of maladaptive narcissism, adaptive narcissism also predicted decreased pre-putt time in Experiment 2 and an adaptive psychophysiological response in Experiment 3, reflecting better processing efficiency. Findings suggest that individuals high in both aspects of narcissism perform better under pressure thanks to superior task processing. In performance contexts, the terms ""adaptive"" and ""maladaptive""-adopted from social psychology-are oversimplistic and inaccurate.

308250,Robot to support older people to live independently,2021-04-15,"BACKGROUND: Early in the pandemic, we designed a SARS-CoV-2 peptide vaccine containing epitope regions optimized for concurrent B cell, CD4+ T cell, and CD8+ T cell stimulation. The rationale for this design was to drive both humoral and cellular immunity with high specificity while avoiding undesired effects such as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). METHODS: We explored the set of computationally predicted SARS-CoV-2 HLA-I and HLA-II ligands, examining protein source, concurrent human/murine coverage, and population coverage. Beyond MHC affinity, T cell vaccine candidates were further refined by predicted immunogenicity, sequence conservation, source protein abundance, and coverage of high frequency HLA alleles. B cell epitope regions were chosen from linear epitope mapping studies of convalescent patient serum, followed by filtering for surface accessibility, sequence conservation, spatial localization near functional domains of the spike glycoprotein, and avoidance of glycosylation sites. RESULTS: From 58 initial candidates, three B cell epitope regions were identified. From 3730 (MHC-I) and 5045 (MHC-II) candidate ligands, 292 CD8+ and 284 CD4+ T cell epitopes were identified. By combining these B cell and T cell analyses, as well as a manufacturability heuristic, we proposed a set of 22 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine peptides for use in subsequent murine studies. We curated a dataset of ~ 1000 observed T cell epitopes from convalescent COVID-19 patients across eight studies, showing 8/15 recurrent epitope regions to overlap with at least one of our candidate peptides. Of the 22 candidate vaccine peptides, 16 (n = 10 T cell epitope optimized; n = 6 B cell epitope optimized) were manually selected to decrease their degree of sequence overlap and then synthesized. The immunogenicity of the synthesized vaccine peptides was validated using ELISpot and ELISA following murine vaccination. Strong T cell responses were observed in 7/10 T cell epitope optimized peptides following vaccination. Humoral responses were deficient, likely due to the unrestricted conformational space inhabited by linear vaccine peptides. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we find our selection process and vaccine formulation to be appropriate for identifying T cell epitopes and eliciting T cell responses against those epitopes. Further studies are needed to optimize prediction and induction of B cell responses, as well as study the protective capacity of predicted T and B cell epitopes.","Smith, Christof C; Olsen, Kelly S; Gentry, Kaylee M; Sambade, Maria; Beck, Wolfgang; Garness, Jason; Entwistle, Sarah; Willis, Caryn; Vensko, Steven; Woods, Allison; Fini, Misha; Carpenter, Brandon; Routh, Eric; Kodysh, Julia; O039,; Donnell, Timothy; Haber, Carsten; Heiss, Kirsten; Stadler, Volker; Garrison, Erik; Sandor, Adam M; Ting, Jenny P Y; Weiss, Jared; Krajewski, Krzysztof; Grant, Oliver C; Woods, Robert J; Heise, Mark; Vincent, Benjamin G; Rubinsteyn, Alex",Genome Med,,336

This report describes the demographic, clinical, and epidemiologic characteristics of 544 U.S. persons under investigation (PUI) for COVID-19 with complete SARS-CoV-2 testing in the beginning stages of the pandemic from January 17 through February 29, 2020. METHODS: In this surveillance cohort, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provided consultation to public health and healthcare professionals to identify PUI for SARS-CoV-2 testing by quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR. Demographic, clinical, and epidemiologic characteristics of PUI were reported by public health and healthcare professionals during consultation with on-call CDC clinicians and subsequent submission of a CDC PUI Report Form. Characteristics of laboratory-negative and laboratory-positive persons were summarized as proportions for the period of January 17-February 29, and characteristics of all PUI were compared before and after February 12 using prevalence ratios. RESULTS: A total of 36 PUI tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were classified as confirmed cases. Confirmed cases and PUI testing negative for SARS-CoV-2 had similar demographic, clinical, and epidemiologic characteristics. Consistent with changes in PUI evaluation criteria, 88% (13/15) of confirmed cases detected before February 12, 2020, reported travel from China. After February 12, 57% (12/21) of confirmed cases reported no known travel- or contact-related exposures.

We show evidence of strong purifying selection around the receptor binding motif (RBM) in the spike and other genes among bat, pangolin, and human coronaviruses, suggesting similar evolutionary constraints in different host species. We also demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2's entire RBM was introduced through recombination with coronaviruses from pangolins, possibly a critical step in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2's ability to infect humans. Similar purifying selection in different host species, together with frequent recombination among coronaviruses, suggests a common evolutionary mechanism that could lead to new emerging human coronaviruses.","Li, Xiaojun; Giorgi, Elena E; Marichannegowda, Manukumar Honnayakanahalli; Foley, Brian; Xiao, Chuan; Kong, Xiang-Peng; Chen, Yue; Gnanakaran, S; Korber, Bette; Gao, Feng",Sci.

Alaska's seafood processing industry attracts approximately 18,000 out-of-state workers annually (2). Many of the state's seafood processing facilities are located in remote areas with limited health care capacity. On March 23, 2020, the governor of Alaska issued a COVID-19 health mandate (HM10) to address health concerns related to the impending influx of workers amid the COVID-19 pandemic (3). HM10 required employers bringing critical infrastructure (essential) workers into Alaska to submit a Community Workforce Protective Plan.* On May 15, 2020, Appendix 1 was added to the mandate, which outlined specific requirements for seafood processors, to reduce the risk for transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in these high-density workplaces (4). These requirements included measures to prevent introduction of SARS-CoV-2 into the workplace, including testing of incoming workers and a 14-day entry quarantine before workers could enter nonquarantine residences. After 13 COVID-19 outbreaks in Alaska seafood processing facilities and on processing vessels during summer and early fall 2020, State of Alaska personnel and CDC field assignees reviewed the state's seafood processing-associated cases.

311355,The challenges of COVID-19 for people with dementia with Lewy bodies and family caregivers,2020,"Guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus) have been used in research since the 19th century to collect data due to their physiological similarities to humans. Today, animals perform a vital role in experiments and concerns for laboratory animal welfare are enshrined in the 3R framework of reduction, refinement and replacement. This case study explores a refinement in humane euthanasia of guinea pigs via the use of an irreversible penetrating spring-loaded captive bolt (CB). Penetrating spring-loaded CB stunning for euthanasia (CBE) was performed on 12 guinea pigs with the parameters for humane slaughter of production animals in order to assess the suitability of this method of euthanasia in contrast to blunt force trauma (BFT). All 12 of the guinea pigs were rendered immediately unconscious with excellent experimental tissue quality collection, high repeatability of results and operator (n = 8) preference over BFT. Overall, CBE in guinea pigs appears to be a feasible refinement for animal welfare, human preference and improved tissue quality for experimental collection in settings where uncontaminated tissues are required.","Cohen, Shari; Kwok, Melody; Huang, Joel",,,336

In this study, we elucidated the potential mechanisms of aerobic exercise in ameliorating kidney injury following myocardial infarction (MI). In vivo, wildtype and alcat1 knockout mice were used to establish the MI model, and subjected to six-week moderate-intensity aerobic exercise. In vitro, Normal Rat Kidney (NRK) cells treated with H2O2 and recombinant human Irisin (rhIrisin) were used for exploring potential mechanisms. Our results showed that Irisin expression was up-regulated by aerobic exercise in kidneys after MI, while ALCAT1 was reduced. In alcat1 knockout mice, we found that ALCAT1 involved in the progressions of oxidative stress and apoptosis in impaired kidney tissues of MI mice, but aerobic exercise reversed these changes. Furthermore, in vitro, we observed that Irisin inhibited both H2O2-treatment or overexpression of alcat1-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in NRK cells, partially via AMPK-Sirt1-PGC-1&#945; pathway. These findings reveal that aerobic exercise participates in alleviating the levels of oxidative stress and apoptosis in impaired kidney tissues following MI, partially via activating FNDC5/Irisin-AMPK-Sirt1-PGC-1&#945; signaling pathway and inhibiting ALCAT1 expression.","Wu, Fangnan; Li, Zhuo; Cai, Mengxin; Xi, Yue; Xu, Zujie; Zhang, Zezhou; Li, Hangzhuo; Zhu, Wanyu; Tian, Zhenjun",Free radic. biol. med,,336

313102,Comorbidities in Patients with COVID-19 and Their Impact on the Severity of the Disease,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To discuss the research progress in the field of coronavirus (CoVs) treatment based on the visualization analysis of knowledge graph. METHODS: The related literatures in the field of CoVs treatment were retrieved from the establishment of Web of Science core collection database to February 15th, 2020, and the literature analysis tool of Web of Science database was used to count the annual trend of published literatures. The VOSviewer software was used to analyze the relationship among countries, institutions, authors, clustering and density of subject words. The HistCite software was used to screen important documents and to draw the evolution process of hot spots. The CiteSpace software was used to analyze the breakout points of subject words, so as to find the front and hot spots in this field. RESULTS: A total of 1 747 data were retrieved, with the exception of 17 duplicate data, and 1 730 data were retained for visualization analysis. In terms of literature volume, the literatures on CoVs therapy rose after 2003 and 2012, and the number of published literatures had remained high since 2014. In terms of countries, the main countries that carried out the research on the treatment of CoVs were the United States (n = 613), China (n = 582), Germany (n = 122), Canada (n = 99), etc., and the cooperation among countries was close. In terms of institutions, the number of papers issued by Chinese Academy of Sciences in the field of CoVs treatment ranked first (n = 82), followed by University of Hong Kong of China (n = 74) and Chinese University of Hong Kong of China (n = 58), followed by National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (n = 37), and the cooperation among various institutions was close. In terms of literature authors, there were two high-yielding authors in the United States [Ralph S.

313368,Psychological and Emotional Impact of Patients Living in Psychiatric Treatment Communities during Covid-19 Lockdown in Italy,2020,"BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women in developing countries. Malnutrition is associated with poor prognosis and early detection of malnutrition and timely nutritional interventions can improve the outcome for cervical cancer patients. The study was aimed to assess the association between the nutritional status and survival of cervical cancer patients. METHODS: A prospective cohort study design was used. Overall 175 cervical cancer patients were followed over one year period with (median 8.5 mo, range (3.6-12). RESULTS: The prevalence of malnutrition determined by means of the PG-SGA was 17.7% at admission and 47.1% at the end of follow-up. According to the SGA, one in three (29.7%) patients required nutritional intervention at the end of follow-up. Patients who were malnourished (PG-SGA-B and C) had an increased risk of mortality (Hazard Ratio [HR]: 3.12, 95% CI: 1.23 - 7.86) as compared to those who were well nourished (PG-SGA-A). Patients from rural areas had an increased risk of mortality (HR: 6.99, 95% CI: 2.07 - 23.58) compared to patients from urban areas. CONCLUSION: In the context of developing country setting and COVID19 outbreak, malnutrition significantly decreases cervical cancer survival. A thorough nutrition assessment using scored PG-SGA is needed.","Argefa, Terefe Gelibo; Roets, Lizeth",Nutr Cancer,,336

To gain adequate visualization of relevant structures, surgical assistants often assume awkward positioning with inadequate stability of handheld retractors. Additionally, the lead surgeon is typically the only member of the surgical team who can adequately visualize the procedure being performed. To that end, devices have been manufactured with aims of optimizing both visualization and workspace while reducing the need of handheld retractors during vaginal surgery. This video presents one of those retractors: a reusable, self-retaining, vaginal Magrina-Bookwalter, with details to help achieve the optimal visualization and workspace with its use. METHODS: A narrated video provides a brief history, components and proper assembly of the retractor with stepwise application of components demonstrated during a vaginal hysterectomy. CONCLUSION: The self-retaining, vaginal Magrina-Bookwalter retractor is a helpful tool to optimize the visualization and workspace while reducing the need for handheld retractors during vaginal procedures deeper into the pelvis.","Cope, Zebulun S; Francis, Sean; Cardenas-Trowers, Olivia; Gupta, Ankita",Int. urogynecol. j.

STUDY DESIGN: This is a cohort study of asymptomatic pregnant women who underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing between April 13, 2020 and April 26, 2020. Semistructured interviews were conducted via telephone at 1 and 2 weeks posthospitalization to assess maternal mental health. Depression screening was conducted using the patient health questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2). An online survey of labor and delivery health care workers assessed job satisfaction and job-related anxiety before and during the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, as well as employees' subjective experience with universal testing. Patient and employee responses were analyzed for recurring themes. RESULTS: A total of 318 asymptomatic women underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing during this 2-week period. Six of the eight women (75%) who tested positive reported negative in-hospital experiences secondary to perceived lack of provider and partner support and neonatal separation after birth. Among the 310 women who tested negative, 34.4% of multiparous women reported increased postpartum anxiety compared with their prior deliveries due to concerns about infectious exposure in the hospital and lack of social support. Only 27.6% of women, tested negative, found their test result to be reassuring. Job satisfaction and job-related anxiety among health care workers were negatively affected. Universal testing was viewed favorably by the majority of health care workers despite concerns about delays or alterations in patient care and maternal and neonatal separation. CONCLUSION: Universal testing for SARS-CoV-2 in obstetric units has mixed effects on maternal mental health but is viewed favorably by labor and delivery employees. Ongoing evaluation of new testing protocols is paramount to balance staff and patient safety with quality and equality of care. KEY POINTS: · Women with SARS-CoV-2 had a negative hospital experience.. · A negative SARS-CoV-2 test was not reassuring for patients.. · COVID-19 negatively impacts healthcare workers' well-being..","Bender, Whitney R; Srinivas, Sindhu; Coutifaris, Paulina; Acker, Alexandra; Hirshberg, Adi",Am J Perinatol,,336

318114,Psychological Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Adults and Their Children in Italy,2021,"One of the main protective measures against COVID-19's spread is the use of face masks. It is therefore of the utmost importance for face masks to be high functioning in terms of their filtration ability and comfort. Notwithstanding the prevalence of the commercial polypropylene face masks, its effectiveness is under contention, leaving vast room for improvement. During the pandemic, the use of at least one mask per day for each individual results in a massive number of masks that need to be safely disposed of. Fabricating biodegradable filters of high efficiency not only can protect individuals and save the environment but also can be sewed on reusable/washable cloth masks to reduce expenses. Wearing surgical masks for long periods of time, especially in hot regions, causes discomfort by irritating sensitive facial skin and warmed inhaled air. Herein, we demonstrate the fabrication of novel electrospun composites layers as face mask filters for protection against pathogens and tiny particulates. The combinatorial filter layers are made by integrating TiO2 nanotubes as fillers into chitosan/poly(vinyl alcohol) polymeric electrospun nanofibers as the outer layer. The other two filler-free layers, chitosan/poly(vinyl alcohol) and silk/poly(vinyl alcohol) as the middle and inner composite layers, respectively, were used for controlled protection, contamination prevention, and comfort for prolonged usage. The ASTM standards evaluation tests were adopted to evaluate the efficacy of the assembled filter, revealing high filtration efficiency compared to that of commercial surgical masks. The TiO2/Cs/PVA outer layer significantly reduced Staphylococcus aureus bacteria by 44.8% compared to the control, revealing the dual effect of TiO2 and chitosan toward the infectious bacterial colonies. Additionally, molecular dynamics calculations were used to assess the mechanical properties of the filter layers.","Abbas, Walaa A; Shaheen, Basamat S; Ghanem, Loujain G; Badawy, Ibrahim M; Abodouh, Mohamed M; Abdou, Shrouk M; Zada, Suher; Allam, Nageh K",Langmuir,,336

The acute phase of Chagas disease is characterized by several symptoms: fever, fatigue, body aches, headache and cardiopathy’s. Chronic phase could be asymptomatic or symptomatic with cardiac compromise. Since the emergence of the pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the cardiovascular involvement has been identified as a complication commonly reported in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Due to the lack of knowledge of the cardiac affectations that this virus could cause in patients with Chagas disease, the aim of this review is to describe the possible cardiac affectations, as well as the treatment and recommendations that patients with both infections should carry out. Methods: The authors revised the recent and relevant literature concerning the topic and discussed advances and limitations of studies on COVID-19 and their impact in Chagas disease patients, principally with cardiac affectations. Results: There currently exists little information about the consequences that Chagas disease patients can suffer when they are infected with COVID-19. Conclusions: This review highlights the emerging challenges of access to medical care and future research needs in order to understand the implications that co-infections (SARS-CoV-2 or other viruses) can generate in Chagas disease-infected people.","Diaz-Hernandez, Alejandro Gonzalez-Vazquez Maria Cristina Arce-Fonseca Minerva Rodriguez-Morales Olivia Cedilllo-Ramirez Maria Lilia Carabarin-Lima Alejandro",Biology,,336

Guided by a feminist life span approach, this study examined interviewing dynamics between a younger woman interviewer and older women research participants, ages 57-93 (mean = 65.3), in two qualitative studies completed five years apart. Four themes emerged: 1) contrasting experiences drew explicit attention to discrepancies in historical context, age, and life experience between participants and the interviewer. Similarities often arose in the theme of 2) invoking expertise in which participants oriented to or invoked their own expertise in their life story and experiences and the interviewer's expertise in research, sexuality studies, and social services.

321750,Evidence of a Blood Pressure Reduction During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Associated Lockdown Period: Insights from e-Health Data,2021,"Innate immune interferons (IFNs), including type I and III IFNs, constitute critical antiviral mechanisms. Recent studies reveal that IFN dysregulation is key to determine COVID-19 pathogenesis. Effective IFN stimulation or prophylactic administration of IFNs at the early stage prior to severe COVID-19 may elicit an autonomous antiviral state, restrict the virus infection, and prevent COVID-19 progression. Inborn genetic flaws and autoreactive antibodies that block IFN response have been significantly associated with about 14% of patients with life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia. In most severe COVID-19 patients without genetic errors in IFN-relevant gene loci, IFN dysregulation is progressively worsened and associated with the situation of pro-inflammation and immunopathy, which is prone to autoimmunity. In addition, the high correlation of severe COVID-19 with seniority, males, and individuals with pre-existing comorbidities will be plausibly explained by the coincidence of IFN aberrance in these situations. Collectively, current studies call for a better understanding of the IFN response regarding the spatiotemporal determination and subtype-specificity against SARS-CoV-2 infections, which are warranted to devise IFN-related prophylactics and therapies.","Lopez, LeAnn; Sang, Peter C; Tian, Yun; Sang, Yongming",Viruses,,336

323531,Depressive symptoms in students during school closure due to COVID-19 in Shanghai,2020,"SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, leads to a respiratory syndrome and other manifestations. Most affected people show no or mild symptoms, but the risk of severe disease and death increases in older people. Here, we report a narrative review on selected studies targeting aging-related chronic neuroinflammation in the COVID-19 pandemic. A hyperactivation of the innate immune system with elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines occurs during severe COVID-19, pointing to an important role of the innate immune dysregulation in the disease outcome. Aging is characterized by a general condition of low-grade inflammation, also connected to chronic inflammation of the brain (neuroinflammation), which is involved in frailty syndrome and contributes to several age-associated diseases, including neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. Since neuroinflammation can be induced or worsened by the virus infection itself, as well as by stressful conditions like those linked to the recent pandemic, the role of neuroinflammatory mechanisms could be central in a vicious circle leading to an increase in the mortality risk in aged COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, triggered neuroinflammatory pathways and consequent neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric conditions might be potential long-term complications of COVID-19. In order to provide insights to help clinicians in identifying patients who progress to a more severe case of the disease, this review underlines the potential implications of aging-related neuroinflammation in COVID-19 pandemic.","Bossù, Paola; Toppi, Elisa; Sterbini, Valentina; Spalletta, Gianfranco",,,336

RESULTS: The examined websites provide information about COVID-19, but only rarely about how to behave in the case of another (suspected) disease regarding healthcare utilization. Two health information provider portals, one health insurance company, but none of the KVs offer explicit decision support. KVs refer more often, but not consistently, to the general possibility of video consulting. DISCUSSION: Information concerning the topic is scarce for most of the patients.

Based upon current researches, this virus is spreading from one human to another through respiratory droplets, i.e. cough and sneeze. Till now, there has not been any specific treatment found for this virus. Hence, there is a critical need to discover alternative techniques to cope with the current scenario. RECENT FINDINGS: This review conducted an online search for prevention of coronavirus infection with the help of nutritional interventions. It has been observed that the effect of the virus is mostly on the individual with low immunity, individual affected with diseases like diabetes, and individual using any immune-suppressed drug or having past history of major surgeries or severe medical conditions. Therefore, consuming foods which boost immunity helps in preventing respiratory-related disorder or suppressing diseases-related problems, which could be helpful in controlling the spread of this virus. In conclusion, it has been suggested that before the beginning of generalised treatments and interventions in each infected patient, nutritional status should be evaluated, as it can help in creating a specific nutrition intervention for the infected individual.","Budhwar, Savita; Sethi, Kashika; Chakraborty, Manali",Curr Nutr Rep,,336

Furthermore, we agree with a recommendation that glucocorticoids should not be used routinely for COVID-19 patients and suggested to be beneficial only for patients with late acute respiratory distress syndrome. A clinical proof of ibuprofen safety in COVID-19 has been published by other researchers and we suggest that early administration of NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, in COVID-19 is not only safe but it might also prevent COVID-19 complications and this manuscript explains some of the suggested associated protective mechanisms.","Kelleni, Mina T",Biomed Pharmacother,,336
327408,Depression and sexual functions in epilepsy patients: Comparison before and during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Xiaokeyinshui (XKYS) formula, an anti-diabetic formula, was recorded in many ancient Chinese medical books. Xiaokeyinshui extract combination (XEC) originated from this ancient formula, consisting extracts of four herbal drugs, namely, Coptidis Rhizoma, Liriopes Radix, bitter melon, and Cassiae Semen. OBJECTIVE: Therapeutic effects of Xiaokeyinshui extract combination (XEC) were assessed on diabetic rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Herb extracts were prepared and mixed, yielding XEC. XEC were intragastrically given at doses of 260, 380 and 500â¯mg/kg/d to diabetic rats for 60 days. Anti-diabetic effects of XEC were studied, with measurement of body weight, and assessment of both glycemic control and lipid management. Measurement of oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokines were conducted in accordance to protocols of commercial kits. Parameters related to renal functions were also measured. Western blot (WB) analysis was performed to explore the anti-diabetic and renal protective mechanisms of XEC. RESULTS: Compared to diabetic control, XEC exhibited significant effects in both glucose-lowering and lipid management (pâ¯<â¯0.01). Both oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokines were reduced after treatment of XEC for two months. In addition, XEC exhibited renal protective effects. WB analysis of liver tissue demonstrated that XEC achieved anti-diabetic effects through up-regulation of InsR&#945;/IRS-1/PI3K/Akt/GLUT4 signaling pathway and phosphorylation of AMPK. In addition, renal protective effects were also achieved with down-regulation of RAGE and VEGF expressions in kidney. CONCLUSIONS: XEC exerts promising anti-diabetic and renal protective effects on diabetic rats in multi-target mechanisms. XEC could be a satisfying alternative treating T2DM and preventing diabetic nephropathy.","Zhou, Jiewen; Pan, Jun; Xiang, Zhinan; Wang, Qiuyan; Tong, Qilin; Fang, Jinbo; Wan, Luosheng; Chen, Jiachun",J Ethnopharmacol,,336

Today, several vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have been approved, and some neutralizing monoclonal antibodies are being tested as therapeutic approaches for COVID-19 but, one of the key questions is whether both vaccines and monoclonal antibodies could be effective against infections by new SARS-CoV-2 variants. Nevertheless, there are currently more than 1000 ongoing clinical trials focusing on the use and effectiveness of antiviral drugs as a possible therapeutic treatment. Among the classes of antiviral drugs are included 3CL protein inhibitors, RNA synthesis inhibitors and other small molecule drugs which target the ability of SARS-COV-2 to interact with host cells. Considering the need to find specific treatment to prevent the emergent outbreak, the aim of this review is to explain how some repurposed antiviral drugs, indicated for the treatment of other viral infections, could be potential candidates for the treatment of COVID-19.","Vittoria, Bauso Luana Imbesi Chiara Irene Gasparo Calì Gabriella Bitto Alessandra",Pharmaceuticals,,336

Since many things should be handled through the online operations, the traditional system for offline events should be re-designed to support the whole process of virtual events. In this paper, we propose an architecture of an all-in-one platform for virtual conferences. The platform provides full services required by a virtual conference which is easy enough for both IT and non-IT experts. The platform provides tailored functions and menus according to the specific size, nature, and field of an academic event. Experimental results show that the parallel upload function of the proposed architecture achieves significantly higher upload speed for sharing a presentation video after the recording ends, compared to the usual video upload function.","Park, K.; Oh, G.; Cho, K.; Pack, S.; Ieee,","11th International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC) - Data, Network, and AI in the age of Untact (ICTC)",,336

In May 2020, CDC funded* 64 state, local, and territorial health departments to support COVID-19 response activities. As part of the monitoring process, case investigation and contact tracing metrics for June 25-July 24, 2020, were submitted to CDC by 62 health departments. Descriptive analyses of case investigation and contact tracing load, timeliness, and yield (i.e., the number of contacts elicited divided by the number of patients prioritized for interview) were performed. A median of 57% of patients were interviewed within 24 hours of report of the case to a health department (interquartile range [IQR] = 27%-82%); a median of 1.15 contacts were identified per patient prioritized for interview§ (IQR = 0.62-1.76), and a median of 55% of contacts were notified within 24 hours of identification by a patient (IQR = 32%-79%). With higher caseloads, the percentage of patients interviewed within 24 hours of case report was lower (Spearman coefficient = -0.68), and the number of contacts identified per patient prioritized for interview also decreased (Spearman coefficient = -0.60). The capacity to conduct timely contact tracing varied among health departments, largely driven by investigators' caseloads. Incomplete identification of contacts affects the ability to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Enhanced staffing capacity and ability and improved community engagement could lead to more timely interviews and identification of more contacts.","Spencer, Kimberly D; Chung, Christina L; Stargel, Alison; Shultz, Alvin; Thorpe, Phoebe G; Carter, Marion W; Taylor, Melanie M; McFarlane, Mary; Rose, Dale; Honein, Margaret A; Walke, Henry",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,336

There is no specific therapeutics to encounter the COVID-19. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-based therapy is an efficient strategy to control human viral infections employing post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) through neutralizing target complementary mRNA. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) encoded by the viral RdRp gene as a part of the replication-transcription complex can be adopted as an acceptable target for controlling SARS-CoV-2 mediated infection. Therefore, in the current study, accessible siRNA designing tools, including significant algorithms and parameters, were rationally used to design the candidate siRNAs against SARS-COV-2 encoded RdRp. The designed siRNA molecules possessed adequate nucleotide-based and other features for potent gene silencing. The targets of the designed siRNAs revealed no significant matches within the whole human genome, ruling out any possibilities for off-target silencing by the siRNAs. Characterization with different potential parameters of efficacy allowed selecting the finest siRNA among all the designed siRNA molecules. Further, validation assessment and target site accessibility prediction also rationalized the suitability of this siRNA molecule. Molecular docking study between the selected siRNA molecule and component of RNA interference (RNAi) pathway gave an excellent outcome. Molecular dynamics of two complexes: siRNA and argonaute complex, guide RNA, and target protein complex, have shown structural stability of these proteins. Therefore, the designed siRNA molecule might act as an effective therapeutic agent against the SARS-CoV-2 at the genome level and can prevent further outbreaks of COVID-19 in humans.","Shawan, Mohammad Mahfuz Ali Khan; Sharma, Ashish Ranjan; Bhattacharya, Manojit; Mallik, Bidyut; Akhter, Farhana; Shakil, Md Salman; Hossain, Md Mozammel; Banik, Subrata; Lee, Sang-Soo; Hasan, Md Ashraful; Chakraborty, Chiranjib",Infect Genet Evol,,336
334230,"Long Term Physical, Mental and Social Health Effects of COVID-19 in the Pediatric Population: A Scoping Review",2021,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a global health care emergency. Although reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction testing is the reference standard method to identify patients with COVID-19 infection, chest radiography and CT play a vital role in the detection and management of these patients. Prediction models for COVID-19 imaging are rapidly being developed to support medical decision making. However, inadequate availability of a diverse annotated data set has limited the performance and generalizability of existing models. To address this unmet need, the RSNA and Society of Thoracic Radiology collaborated to develop the RSNA International COVID-19 Open Radiology Database (RICORD). This database is the first multi-institutional, multinational, expert-annotated COVID-19 imaging data set. It is made freely available to the machine learning community as a research and educational resource for COVID-19 chest imaging. Pixel-level volumetric segmentation with clinical annotations was performed by thoracic radiology subspecialists for all COVID-19-positive thoracic CT scans. The labeling schema was coordinated with other international consensus panels and COVID-19 data annotation efforts, the European Society of Medical Imaging Informatics, the American College of Radiology, and the American Association of Physicists in Medicine. Study-level COVID-19 classification labels for chest radiographs were annotated by three radiologists, with majority vote adjudication by board-certified radiologists. RICORD consists of 240 thoracic CT scans and 1000 chest radiographs contributed from four international sites. It is anticipated that RICORD will ideally lead to prediction models that can demonstrate sustained performance across populations and health care systems.","Tsai, Emily B; Simpson, Scott; Lungren, Matthew P; Hershman, Michelle; Roshkovan, Leonid; Colak, Errol; Erickson, Bradley J; Shih, George; Stein, Anouk; Kalpathy-Cramer, Jayashree; Shen, Jody; Hafez, Mona; John, Susan; Rajiah, Prabhakar; Pogatchnik, Brian P; Mongan, John; Altinmakas, Emre; Ranschaert, Erik R; Kitamura, Felipe C; Topff, Laurens; Moy, Linda; Kanne, Jeffrey P; Wu, Carol C",Radiology,,336

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using Korea's nationwide healthcare database, which contained all individuals who received a diagnostic test for COVID-19 (n=232,390) as of May 15, 2020. We classified our cohort by health insurance type into beneficiaries of the National Health Insurance (NHI) or Medicaid programs. Our study outcomes were infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and COVID-19-related outcomes, a composite of all-cause death, intensive care unit admission, and mechanical ventilation use. We estimated age-, sex-, and Charlson comorbidity index score-adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a multivariable logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Of the 218,070 NHI and 14,320 Medicaid beneficiaries who received COVID-19 tests, 7,777 and 738 tested positive, respectively. The Medicaid beneficiaries were older (mean age, 57.5 vs. 47.8 years), more likely to be males (47.2 vs. 40.2%), and had a higher comorbidity burden (mean CCI, 2.0 vs. 1.7) than NHI beneficiaries. Compared to NHI beneficiaries, Medicaid beneficiaries had a 22% increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (aOR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.38), but had no significantly elevated risk of COVID-19-related outcomes (aOR 1.10, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.57); the individual events of the composite outcome yielded similar findings. CONCLUSIONS: As socioeconomic factors, with health insurance as a proxy, could serve as determinants during the current pandemic, pre-emptive support is needed for high-risk groups to slow its spread.","Jeong, Han Eol; Lee, Jongseong; Shin, Hyun Joon; Shin, Ju-Young",Epidemiol Health,,336

It is uncertain if the sexes differ for neuromuscular responses to ECC exercise and the ensuing RBE. Twenty-six young adults (13 females) performed two bouts (four weeks apart) of 200 ECC maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs) of the dorsiflexors. Isometric (ISO) MVC torque and the ratio of ISO torque in response to low- vs. high-frequency stimulation (10:100Hz) were compared before and after (2-10min and 2, 4, and 7d) exercise. The decline in ECC and ISO MVC torque, and the 10:100Hz ratio following bout one did not differ between sexes (P > 0.05), with reductions from baseline of 31.5 ± 12.3, 24.1 ± 15.4, and 51.3 ± 12.2%, respectively. After bout two, the 10:100Hz ratio declined less (45.0 ± 12.4% from baseline) and ISO MVC torque recovered sooner compared to bout one but no differences between sexes were evident for the magnitude of the RBE (P > 0.05). These data suggest that fatigability with ECC exercise does not differ for the sexes and adaptations that mitigate impairments to calcium handling are independent of sex. NOVELTY BULLETS: â¢ One bout of 200 maximal eccentric dorsiflexor contractions caused equivalent muscle fatigue and damage for females and males â¢ The repeated bout effect observed after a second bout four weeks later also had no sex-related differences â¢ Prolonged low-frequency force depression is promoted as an indirect measure of muscle damage in humans.","Bruce, Christina D; Ruggiero, Luca; Dix, Gabriel U; Cotton, Paul D; McNeil, Chris J",Appl. physiol. nutr. metab,,336

337801,Impact of COVID-19 on Resettled Refugees,2020,"In recent months, wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has been shown to be an important tool for early detection of SARS-CoV-2 circulation in the population. In this study, a detection methodology for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (wild-type and variants of concern) in wastewater was developed based on the detection of different target genes (E and ORF1ab) by PEG precipitation and digital droplet PCR. This methodology was used to determine the SARS-CoV-2 concentration and the proportion of N501Y mutation in raw sewage of the wastewater treatment plant of the city of Karlsruhe in southwestern Germany over a period of 1 year (June 2020 to July 2021). Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 concentrations with reported COVID-19 cases in the catchment area showed a significant correlation. Viral RNA titre trends appeared more than 12 days earlier than clinical data, demonstrating the potential of wastewater-based epidemiology as an early warning system. Parallel PCR analysis using seven primer and probe systems revealed similar gene copy numbers with E, ORF, RdRP2 and NSP9 assays. RdPP1 and NSP3 generally resulted in lower copy numbers, and in particular for N1 there was low correlation with the other assays due to outliers. The occurrence of the N501Y mutation in the wastewater of Karlsruhe was consistent with the occurrence of the alpha-variant (B.1.1.7) in the corresponding individual clinical tests. In batch experiments SARS-CoV-2 RNA was stable for several days under anaerobic conditions, but the copy numbers decreased rapidly in the presence of dissolved oxygen. Overall, this study shows that wastewater-based epidemiology is a sensitive and robust approach to detect trends in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 at an early stage, contributing to successful pandemic management.","Ho, Johannes; Stange, Claudia; Suhrborg, Rabea; Wurzbacher, Christian; Drewes, Joerg E; Tiehm, Andreas",,,336
338109,An andrologist in the front line Covid-19 team,2020,"Luminescence thermal stability is a major figure of merit of lanthanide-doped nanoparticles playing an essential role in determining their potential applications in advanced optics. Unfortunately, considering the intensification of multiple electron-vibration interactions as temperature increases, luminescence thermal quenching of lanthanide-doped materials is generally considered to be inevitable. Recently, the emergence of thermally enhanced upconversion luminescence in lanthanide-doped nanoparticles seemed to challenge this stereotype, and the research on this topic rapidly aroused wide attention. While considerable efforts have been made to explore the origin of this phenomenon, the key mechanism of luminescence enhancement is still under debate. Here, to sort out the context of this intriguing finding, the reported results on this exciting topic are reviewed, and the corresponding enhancement mechanisms as proposed by different researchers are summarized. Detailed analyses are provided to evaluate the contribution of the most believed ""surface-attached moisture desorption"" process on the overall luminescence enhancement of lanthanide-doped nanoparticles at elevated temperatures. The impacts of other surface-related processes and shell passivation on the luminescence behaviour of the lanthanide-doped materials are also elaborated. Lack of standardization in the reported data and the absence of important experimental information, which greatly hinders the cross-checking and reanalysis of the results, is emphasized as well. On the foundation of these discussions, it is realized that the thermal-induced luminescence enhancement is a form of recovery process against the strong luminescence quenching in the system, and the enhancement degree is closely associated with the extent of luminescence loss induced by various quenching effects beforehand.","Shi, Rui; Martinez, Eduardo D; Brites, Carlos D S; Carlos, Luís D",,,336

METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was completed by 2722 persons with Multiple Sclerosis, after Italy instituted a national lockdown in response to the pandemic. RESULTS: Persons with Multiple Sclerosis reported that the pandemic caused broad disruptions to usual health and social care services, which impacted on their health and wellbeing. Disruptions in care were consistently associated with negative self-reported impacts on the expected progression of the disease, on out-of-pocket expenditure and on carer's stress. Psychological consequences were associated with interruption to usual psychological support, and concerns about the safety of care delivered in person. CONCLUSIONS: The quality of life of persons with Multiple Sclerosis depends greatly on prompt access to a broad range of health and care services. Negative psychological impacts reported by persons with Multiple Sclerosis with less severe disabilities show that accessible integrated services are crucial for maintenance of their wellbeing. Most persons with Multiple Sclerosis with more severe disability experienced negative impacts on perceived health. Their carers compensating for lack of social input resulted in care overburden. As continuity of care is crucial for persons with Multiple Sclerosis, as well as for persons with chronic conditions in general, strategies must be in place to ensure it is included in future pandemic response plans.","Manacorda, Tommaso; Bandiera, Paolo; Terzuoli, Federica; Ponzio, Michela; Brichetto, Giampaolo; Zaratin, Paola; Bezzini, Daiana; Battaglia, Mario A",J Health Serv Res Policy,,336

METHODS: Data reported by the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA), up to 15 July, when COVID-19 was confirmed were used as research data in connection with the National Health Insurance Service's (NHIS) national health information database. The final analysis targets were 12,646 confirmed patients and 303 deaths. The survival rate of patients with COVID-19 was estimated through Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was performed to search for factors affecting survival. RESULTS: When looking at the survival rate by age group for men and women, the 28-day survival rate for men aged >80 years was 77% and 73% at 42 days, while 83% and 81% for women. Men had a worse survival rate than women. For chronic diseases, the highest risk of mortality was observed in malignant neoplasms of the respiratory and urogenital systems, followed by diseases of the urinary system and diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: The number of COVID-19 deaths was highest the next day after initial diagnosis.

341090,"These Four Telehealth Changes Should Stay, Even After the Pandemic",2021,"We conducted a cross-sectional survey to assess the anxiety, distress, and turnover intention (likelihood to leave their current job) of healthcare workers in Peru during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results reported that 21.7% healthcare workers in Peru experienced severe anxiety, whereas 26.1% of them experienced severe mental distress. A higher level of education related with a lower level of anxiety. Younger workers had a higher level of turnover intention than their older colleagues did. Healthcare workers in the private sector had a higher turnover intention than those in the public sector. Most importantly, people who were geographically far from Lima, the epicenter in Peru, during the outbreak experienced less anxiety and mental distress, corroborating the ripple effect and disconfirming the typhoon eye theory. However, the direction of these relationships can change depending on the type of institutions (public versus private) and the type of employees' contract (full time versus part time). Our research helps provide insights for clinical professionals in identifying the vulnerable groups to mental disorders in Peru.

343133,Threat perceptions and the intention to acquire firearms,2021,"In March of 2020, state governments in the United States began implementing stay-at-home orders in an attempt to curtail the spread of COVID-19. As a result, most people experienced a decrease in face-to-face interactions as they limited their participation in social gatherings, travel, and in-person work. Although these orders aimed to stop the spread of COVID-19, a potential unintended consequence of these guidelines was an increase in loneliness, which has several negative mental and physical health consequences. The goals of the present study were to investigate the extent that one’s romantic relationship status and living arrangements affected self-reports of loneliness and to track how self-reports of loneliness changed over the span of 1 month following the first stay-at-home orders in the United States. Participants (&lt;italic&gt;N&lt;/italic&gt; = 311) reported their loneliness at three time points in 2-week intervals. Results showed considerable overlap between living arrangements and romantic relationship status in predicting loneliness;however, it appears that living with another person has a greater protective effect against loneliness compared to relationship status. That is, whereas living with others or being in a romantic relationship both predicted lower loneliness scores, one’s living arrangements accounted for variance in loneliness scores beyond what was accounted for by one’s relationship status. The researcher also explored whether loneliness increased across three time points throughout data collection. Results showed that loneliness levels remained approximately the same across time. An unhypothesized interaction effect did emerge between time and age. Subsequent probing of this interact effects showed that young adults experienced the greatest level of loneliness but this loneliness decreased over the month, whereas older adults experienced less loneliness but experienced a small increase in loneliness over the during this time. Together, these results suggest that certain groups of people were more likely to experience loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The method used is a spatial method with the Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis technique. The results of this study explain that the spread of COVID-19 very much occurs in the region of moderate latitude. Besides, tropical climate conditions can also make the virus more quickly become unstable. The Coronavirus spreads faster in countries with high latitudes and humid climates. The spread and concentration of the COVID-19 virus increasingly to the poles are easier to develop, current conditions at high latitudes or poles are not significantly affected due to a small population concentration and population activity, so the virus cannot spread, because the body's virus does not find a host (human) to live and develop.","Oktorie, Olivia; Berd, Isril","Sumatra Journal Of Disaster, Geography And Geography Education",,336
343318,To monitor the COVID-19 pandemic we need better quality primary care data,2020,"Purpose: Two months after its first COVID-19 case, Italy counted more than 190,000 confirmed positive cases. From the beginning of April 2020, the nationwide lockdown started to show early effects by reducing the total cumulative incidence reached by the epidemic wave. Here we provide the reproduction number estimation both in space and in time from February 24 to April 24, 2020 over 2 months into the epidemic. Methods: The aim of the present work was to provide a systematical mapping of the SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics spread to all regions of Italy. To do so, we estimated the basic reproduction number (R 0 ), by using the maximum likelihood estimation method in the early stage of the epidemic. In addition, we determined time evolution of this parameter across the 2 months of the observational period. Finally, we linked R t , with two indices, the first representing the number of contagious people and the latter the density of susceptibiltiy to infection of people in a region as recorded on April 24, 2020. Results: Our estimates suggest a basic reproduction number averaged over all the regions of 3.29. Based on the SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics reported here, we gave a quantitative evaluation of the efficiency of the government measures to lower the reproduction number below 1 (control regime). We estimated that the worst-hit regions in Italy reached the control regime level (R t < 1) in about a month. Conclusion: Our work was carried out in the period between April and July,2020. We found that the mean value of time to reach the control regime across the whole country was about 31 days from February 24, 2020. Moreover, we highlighted the interplay between the reproduction number and two epidemiological/demographic indices to evaluate the ""state of activity"" of the epidemic, potentially helping in challenging decisions to continue, ease, or tighten restrictions.

Its therapeutic effect during infections has been a matter of debate, with conflicting results in studies of respiratory infections and in critically ill patients. This comprehensive review aimed to summarize the current evidence regarding the use of vitamin C in the prevention or treatment of patients with SARS-CoV2 infection, based on available publications between January 2020 and February 2021. Overall, 21 publications were included in this review, consisting of case-reports and case-series, observational studies, and some clinical trials. In many of the publications, data were incomplete, and in most clinical trials the results are still pending. No studies regarding prevention of COVID-19 with vitamin C supplementation were found. Although some clinical observations reported improved medical condition of patients with COVID-19 treated with vitamin C, available data from controlled studies are scarce and inconclusive. Based on the theoretical background presented in this article, and some preliminary encouraging studies, the role of vitamin C in the treatment of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection should be further investigated.","Milani, Gregorio Paolo; Macchi, Marina; Guz-Mark, Anat",Nutrients,,336

345274,"Predicting COVID-19 preventive behaviors based on health belief model: an internet-based study in Mazandaran province, Iran",2020,"In this study we present the first comprehensive analysis of the spatio-temporal differences in excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. We used a population-based design on all-cause mortality data, for the 7,904 Italian municipalities. We estimated sex-specific weekly mortality rates for each municipality, based on the first four months of 2016-2019, while adjusting for age, localised temporal trends and the effect of temperature. Then, we predicted all-cause weekly deaths and mortality rates at municipality level for the same period in 2020, based on the modelled spatio-temporal trends. Lombardia showed higher mortality rates than expected from the end of February, with 23,946 (23,013 to 24,786) total excess deaths. North-West and North-East regions showed one week lag, with higher mortality from the beginning of March and 6,942 (6,142 to 7,667) and 8,033 (7,061 to 9,044) total excess deaths respectively. We observed marked geographical differences also at municipality level. For males, the city of Bergamo (Lombardia) showed the largest percent excess, 88.9% (81.9% to 95.2%), at the peak of the pandemic. An excess of 84.2% (73.8% to 93.4%) was also estimated at the same time for males in the city of Pesaro (Central Italy), in stark contrast with the rest of the region, which does not show evidence of excess deaths. We provided a fully probabilistic analysis of excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic at sub-national level, suggesting a differential direct and indirect effect in space and time. Our model can be used to help policy-makers target measures locally to contain the burden on the health-care system as well as reducing social and economic consequences. Additionally, this framework can be used for real-time mortality surveillance, continuous monitoring of local temporal trends and to flag where and when mortality rates deviate from the expected range, which might suggest a second wave of the pandemic.","Blangiardo, Marta; Cameletti, Michela; Pirani, Monica; Corsetti, Gianni; Battaglini, Marco; Baio, Gianluca",PLoS One,,336
346529,Use of glucocorticoids in patients with adrenal insufficiency and COVID-19 infection,2020,"BACKGROUND: Recent epidemiological data indicates that minority groups, especially Hispanic communities, experience a higher rate of infection, hospitalization, and death due to Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19). It is important to understand the nature of this health disparity and what socioeconomic or behavioral factors are putting Hispanic communities and other minority populations at higher risk for morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this project is to assess current COVID-19-related knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) among a predominantly Hispanic population from the Orange County, California community and identify risk factors that may contribute to increased susceptibility and vulnerability to contracting SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Our community Orange County-wide survey consists of quantitative survey questions in four domains: demographic information, COVID-19 knowledge questions, COVID-19 attitude questions, and COVID-19 practices questions. Survey questions are adapted from recent global KAP studies. Participants are being recruited from Amistad Medical Clinic, a private, primary health clinic group in Orange County that treats a predominantly Hispanic population. Patients recruited during telehealth visits are surveyed remotely by phone and those recruited during in-person clinic visits are surveyed in-person. Surveys are conducted by trained members of the study team who are native to the community setting. RESULTS: As of 12 October 2020, we have recruited and enrolled 327 participants. We will conduct data analysis after the recruitment period on 30 October 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Very few current COVID-19 studies focus on the perspective and experience of minority populations. Since Hispanic communities are disproportionately affected by COVID-19, it is important to understand what factors contribute to this disparity and what next steps should be taken to reduce the COVID-19 burden in this population. We believe that our study model of partnering with a local clinic system that serves our study population can be expanded to other settings to compare COVID-19 KAP and associated factors within different minority communities.","Burger, Zoe C; Mehta, Shivani N; Ortiz, Dayanna; Sor, Sekboppa; Kothari, Jigna; Lam, Yvonne; Meka, Meena; Rodwell, Timothy",,,336

Preliminary research suggests an association with meteorological parameters. However, the relationship with temperature and humidity is not yet apparent for COVID-19 cases in US cities first impacted. The objective of this study is to evaluate the association between COVID-19 cases and meteorological parameters in select US cities. A case-crossover design with a distributed lag nonlinear model was used to evaluate the contribution of ambient temperature and specific humidity on COVID-19 cases in select US cities. The case-crossover examines each COVID case as its own control at different time periods (before and after transmission occurred). We modeled the effect of temperature and humidity on COVID-19 transmission using a lag period of 7 days. A subset of 8 cities were evaluated for the relationship with meteorological parameters and 5 cities were evaluated in detail. Short-term exposure to humidity was positively associated with COVID-19 transmission in 4 cities. The associations were small with 3 out of 4 cities exhibiting higher COVID19 transmission with specific humidity that ranged from 6 to 9 g/kg. Our results suggest that weather should be considered in infectious disease modeling efforts. Future work is needed over a longer time period and across different locations to clearly establish the weather-COVID19 relationship.","Runkle, Jennifer D; Sugg, Margaret M; Leeper, Ronald D; Rao, Yuhan; Matthews, Jessica L; Rennie, Jared J",Sci Total Environ,,336

The WHO named this coronavirus 2019-nCoV, with COVID-19 being the name for diseases allied with it. Objective: The study intended to examine the features and characteristics of existing human coronaviruses and identify their resemblance to the newly identified 2019-nCoV. Design: The research team performed a literature review, searching relevant literature databases. We searched four databases, PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and CNKI (Chinese Database), to identify studies reporting COVID-19. Articles published on or before April 10, 2020 were eligible for inclusion. We used the following search terms: ""Coronavirus"" or ""2019-nCoV"" or ""COVID-19"" or ""SARS-CoV"" or ""MERS-CoV"" or ""Bat SARS-CoV"" or ""ACE2 receptor"". Setting: This study was take place in School of Pharmacy, Suresh Gyan Vihar University, Jaipur, India. Results: The undistinguishable similarity of the genomic sequences of Severe Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV, and Bat SARS-CoV-bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21-to nCoV-2019 has facilitated the process of identifying primary treatment measures. Researchers are presuming the existence of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor binding in nCoV-2019, as in SARS-CoV. Researchers have been examining human-to-human transmission, the possibility of an intermediate host between bats and humans, and the existence of asymptomatic cases. An incubation period of 0 to 14 days has been reported, with acute to chronic symptoms being cough, nasal congestion, high fever, dyspnea, pneumonia, invasive lesions in both lungs, respiratory failure, and even death, including in pediatric cases. Mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, repurposing of antivirals, and plasma infusion have proven to be somewhat effective. Several countries have started clinical trials to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of some drugs, but the ability to vaccinate people with existing or new molecules will require time. Previously learned lessons from SARS and MERS have led some areas to be well equipped in terms of the ability to take speedy action. Conclusions: First-level treatments include repurposing antivirals and antimalarials, and plasma infusion should help, but development of existing or new molecules into vaccines will take time. The unpredictable trajectory of this outbreak demands careful surveillance to monitor the situation, draw strategies, implement control measures, and create proper ethical laws and medical guidelines.","Khan, Tahseen; Agnihotri, Kartikeya; Tripathi, Aditi; Mukherjee, Suneet; Agnihotri, Namita; Gupta, Gaurav",Altern Ther Health Med,,336

In this context, we review the data integration efforts required for accessing and searching genome sequences and metadata of SARS-CoV2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 disease, which have been deposited into the most important repositories of viral sequences. Organizations that were already present in the virus domain are now dedicating special interest to the emergence of COVID-19 pandemics, by emphasizing specific SARS-CoV2 data and services. At the same time, novel organizations and resources were born in this critical period to serve specifically the purposes of COVID-19 mitigation while setting the research ground for contrasting possible future pandemics. Accessibility and integration of viral sequence data, possibly in conjunction with the human host genotype and clinical data, are paramount to better understand the COVID-19 disease and mitigate its effects. Few examples of host-pathogen integrated datasets exist so far, but we expect them to grow together with the knowledge of COVID-19 disease; once such datasets will be available, useful integrative surveillance mechanisms can be put in place by observing how common variants distribute in time and space, relating them to the phenotypic impact evidenced in the literature.","Bernasconi, Anna; Canakoglu, Arif; Masseroli, Marco; Pinoli, Pietro; Ceri, Stefano",Brief. bioinform,,336

An understanding of the factors that affect severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection will help fight the COVID-19 pandemic. This study sought to investigate the association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and blood type distribution. The big data provided by the World Health Organization (WHO) and Johns Hopkins University were used to assess the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic. The infection data in the early phase of the pandemic from six countries in each of six geographic zones divided according to the WHO were used, representing approximately 5.4 billion people around the globe. We calculated the infection growth factor, doubling times of infection and death cases, reproductive number and infection and death cases in relation to the blood type distribution. The growth factor of infection and death cases significantly and positively correlated with the proportion of the population with blood type A and negatively correlated with the proportion of the population with blood type B. Compared with the lower blood type A population (<30%), the higher blood type A population (â©¾30%) showed more infection and death cases, higher growth factors and shorter case doubling times for infections and deaths and thus higher epidemic dynamics.

This knowledge complements and refines the epidemiological information about the spread and impact of the virus. For this analysis, we rely on the descriptive exploration of (1) data from The European Surveillance System (TESSy) database developed at the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) on the number of cases and fatality rates and (2) of weekly mortality data collected by Eurostat. The analysis at territorial level studies the changes in R0-the basic reproduction number-and median excess mortality, across territories with different levels of urbanization. The unique findings of this study encompassing most European Union Member States confirm and define the demographic and territorial differential impacts in terms of infections and fatalities during the first wave of the pandemic in 2020. The information is important for stakeholders at European Union, national and sub-national levels in charge of designing containment measures for COVID-19 and adaptation policies for the future by anticipating the rebound for certain segments of the population with differential medical and economic needs.","Goujon, Anne; Natale, Fabrizio; Ghio, Daniela; Conte, Alessandra",J Popul Res (Canberra),,336

COVID-19 has the potential to decimate these already strained surgical healthcare services unless health systems take stringent measures to protect healthcare workers (HCWs) from viral exposure and ensure the continuity of specialised care for patients. The objective of this broad evidence synthesis is to identify and summarise the available literature regarding the efficacy of different personal protective equipment (PPE) in reducing the risk of COVID-19 infection in health personnel caring for patients undergoing trauma surgery in low-resource environments. METHODS: We will conduct several searches in the L·OVE (Living OVerview of Evidence) platform for COVID-19, a system that performs automated regular searches in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and over 30 other sources. The search results will be presented according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses flow diagram. This review will preferentially consider systematic reviews of experimental and quasi-experimental studies, as well as individual studies of such designs, evaluating the effect of different PPE on the risk of COVID-19 infection in HCWs involved in emergency trauma surgery. Critical appraisal of eligible studies for methodological quality will be conducted. Data will be extracted using the standardised data extraction tool in Covidence. Studies will, when possible, be pooled in a statistical meta-analysis using JBI SUMARI. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach for grading the certainty of evidence will be followed and a summary of findings will be created. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval is not required for this review. The plan for dissemination is to publish review findings in a peer-reviewed journal and present findings at high-level conferences that engage the most pertinent stakeholders.

356784,COVID-19 pandemic: personal view to a new model of pediatric practice,2020,"PURPOSE: The COVID-19 pandemic has presented challenges to delivering safe and timely care for cancer patients. The oncology community has undertaken substantial workflow adaptations to reduce transmission risk for patients and providers. While various control measureshave been proposed and implemented, little is known about their impact on safety of the radiation oncology workflow and potential for transmission. The objective of this study was to assess potential safety impacts of control measures employed during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A multi-institutional study was undertaken to assess the risks of pandemic-associated workflow adaptations using failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA). Failure modes were identified and scored using FMEA formalism. FMEA scores were used to identify highest-risk aspects of the radiation therapy process. The impact of control measures on overall risk was quantified. Agreement among institutions was evaluated. RESULTS: Thirty three failure modes and 22 control measures were identified. Control measures resulted in risk score reductions for 22 of the failure modes, with the largest reductions from screening of patients and staff, requiring use of masks, and regular cleaning of patient areas. The median risk score for all failure modes was reduced from 280 to 168. There was high institutional agreement for 90.3% of failure modes but only 47% of control measures. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-related risks are similar across oncology practices in this study. While control measures can reducerisk, their use varied. The effectiveness of control measures on risk may guide selection of the highest-impact workflow adaptions to ensure safe care in oncology.","Viscariello, Natalie; Evans, Suzanne; Parker, Stephanie; Schofield, Deborah; Miller, Brett; Gardner, Stephen; Fong de Los Santos, Luis; Hallemeier, Christopher; Jordan, Loucille; Kim, Edward; Ford, Eric",Radiother Oncol,,336
356869,Nursing students' perceived consequences of self-medication: a qualitative study,2020,"BACKGROUND: We previously reported that the specific IgE levels to &#945;s1-casein (CN) and ß-CN in patients with cow's milk allergy decreased with similar dynamics during oral immunotherapy. Therefore, we hypothesized that &#945;s1- and ß-CN have strong cross-reactivity among CN components, despite the low similarity in the full-length amino acid sequences. METHODS: The &#945;s1-, ß-, and &#954;-CN were purified from commercial cow's milk. We recruited 39 patients with cow's milk allergy, and the serum IgE levels for each CN component were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Cross-reactivity between CN components was investigated by competitive ELISA against &#945;s1-CN. Sequence homology between CN components at the peptide level was calculated using in silico analysis and quantified by the property distance (PD) value. RESULTS: The &#945;s1-CN-specific IgE levels exhibited a strong positive correlation with the ß-CN-specific IgE (r = 0.945, P < .001). Complete competition was observed by ß-CN against &#945;s1-CN, suggesting the presence of common epitopes between them. In silico analysis detected 24 peptide sets with PD values lower than 10 between &#945;s1- and ß-CN, and 14 sets between &#945;s1- and &#954;-CN. The amino acid sequences of &#945;s1-CN (E61-E70) and ß-CN (I12-E21) that showed the lowest PD value (5.30) were present in the characteristic sequence known as casein phosphopeptide (CPP). CONCLUSION: We detected strong cross-reactivity between CN components. Furthermore, we found highly homologous sequences in the CPP region, which contains a core sequence of ""SSSEE"" with phosphorylated serine residues.","Naito, Michihiro; Matsui, Teruaki; Yamada, Chikako; Tagami, Kazunori; Ito, Komei; Izumi, Hidehiko",Pediatr. allergy immunol,,336

The second part discusses the type of ethics that guided officials in their decisions. This type of ethics does not seem to me to be consistent with the ethical vision that would be appropriate in long-term care.

This study is aimed at developing a handy quality assessment tool for stem cell clinical trials, enhancing capacity of the self-regulate overall quality, and participating protection. Methods: The framework of quality assessment tool was based on the PQRS (progress-quality-regulation-scientific) quality assessment tool, and detailed quality indicators were developed by leader group discussion, expert consulting, and literature review. Stem cell clinical trials were retrieved from the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and corresponding quality indicators were assessed and extracted. The validity and feasibility of conceptual quality assessment tool were further evaluated by using structural equation modeling. Results: The quality assessment tool for stem cell clinical trials contains four critical quality attributes, including participant protection, scientific value, quality control, and stem cell products, and 9 observed quality indicators. From 11 primary clinical trial registries in the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, 9410 stem cell trial registrations were identified, and 1036 studies were eligible for publications and protocols screening. After reviewed full text, 37 studies were included in the validity and feasibility evaluation: 32 studies were completed, and 3 studies terminated early. Most of the studies (83.79%) were in the early phase, and 63.16% of the studies were investigator-initiated trial. To further tested for validity, the critical quality attributes and quality indicators (QIs) between expertise further validated by the SEM method, which showed a good fit for the model (chi - square = 26.008; P = 0.353; TLI = 0.967; CFI = 0.978; RMSEA = 0.048). Compared with exploratory trials, evaluating using the quality assessment tool, confirmatory trials performed similarly in participant protection, scientific value, and quality control, but lower in stem cell products. Conclusions: The results of critical quality attributes and quality indicators between expertise and confirmatory validation analysis are basically consistent, indicating the feasibility and validity of applying this quality assessment tool for overall quality evaluation of stem cell trials.","Li, Yixuan; Xie, Li; Wang, Jie; He, Jinghang; Qian, Ying; Zhang, Weituo; Wu, Zhaohui; Qian, Biyun",Stem Cells Int,,336

In this paper, a different approach has been discussed, which is the development of predictive models for the SEIRD variables that have been based on the historical data collected, and the context variables to where this model has been applied to. Particularly, the context variables examined in this paper include total population, number of people over 65 years old, poverty index, morbidity rates, average age, and population density. For the construction of the SEIRD predictive models, this study encompasses a deep analysis of the dependence of these variables and also, their relationship with the context variables. Hence, before the development of predictive models using machine learning techniques, a methodology to analyze the interdependence of the SEIRD variables has been proposed. The dependence with the context variables is also discussed; to avoid the curse of dimensionality and multicollinearity problems, leading to better results and the reduction of the computational cost. Finally, several prediction models based on varied machine learning techniques and inputs are considered, these include temporal interdependence, temporal intra-dependence, and dependence with context variables. Each of the predictive models has been studied, as well as their quality of prediction. This paper focuses on the analysis of the quality of this approach, applied in Colombia, obtaining the results about the performance of the predictive models for the SEIRD variables. The results are very encouraging since the values obtained with the quality metrics are quite good for different prediction horizons.","Quintero, Yullis; Ardila, Douglas; Camargo, Edgar; Rivas, Francklin; Aguilar, Jose",Comput Biol Med,,336

Severe pediatric COVID-19 disease is rare, limiting potential data accumulation on associated respiratory failure in children. Pediatric intensivists and pulmonologists managing COVID-19 patients look to adult guidelines and pediatric-specific consensus statements to guide management. The purpose of this article is to review the current literature and recommended strategies for the escalation of noninvasive and invasive respiratory support for acute respiratory failure associated with COVID-19 disease in children. RECENT FINDINGS: There are no prospective studies comparing COVID-19 treatment strategies in children. Adult and pediatric ventilation management interim guidance is based on evidence-based guidelines in non-COVID acute respiratory distress syndrome, with considerations of (1) noninvasive positive pressure ventilation versus high-flow nasal cannula and (2) high versus lower positive end expiratory pressure strategies related to lung compliance and potential lung recruitability. SUMMARY: Management of acute respiratory failure from COVID-19 requires individualized titration of noninvasive and invasive ventilation modalities with consideration of preserved or compromised pulmonary compliance. Research regarding best practices in the management of pediatric severe COVID-19 with respiratory failure is lacking and is acutely needed as the pandemic surges and vaccination of the pediatric population will be delayed compared to adults.","Blumenthal, Jennifer A; Duvall, Melody G",Curr Opin Pediatr,,336

Knowledge on host-immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, however, remains limited with very few drugs approved to date. Viable strategies and tools are rapidly arising to address this, especially with repurposing of existing drugs offering significant promise. Here we introduce a systems biology tool, the PHENotype SIMulator, which - by leveraging available transcriptomic and proteomic databases - allows modeling of SARS-CoV-2 infection in host cells in silico to i) determine with high sensitivity and specificity (both &gt; 96%) the viral effects on cellular host-immune response, resulting in a specific cellular SARS-CoV-2 signature and ii) utilize this specific signature to narrow down promising repurposable therapeutic strategies.

362369,How and When Does Inclusive Leadership Curb Psychological Distress During a Crisis? Evidence From the COVID-19 Outbreak,2020,"Molecular tests for tuberculosis (TB) have the potential to help reach the three million people with TB who are undiagnosed or not reported each year, and to improve the quality of care TB patients receive by providing accurate, quick results, including rapid drug-susceptibility. The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended the use of molecular nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) tests for TB detection instead of smear microscopy, as they are able to detect TB more accurately, particularly in patients with paucibacillary disease and in people living with HIV. Importantly, some of these WHO-endorsed tests can detect Mycobacterial gene mutations associated with anti-TB drug resistance, allowing for tailoring of effective TB treatment. Currently, a wide array of molecular tests for TB detection is being developed and evaluated, and while some are intended for reference laboratory use, others are being aimed at the point-of-care and peripheral healthcare settings. Notably, there is an emergence of molecular tests designed, manufactured, and rolled out in high TB burden countries, some of which are explicitly aimed for near-patient placement. These developments should increase access to molecular TB testing for larger patient populations. With respect to drug susceptibility testing, NAATs and next generation sequencing can provide results substantially faster than traditional phenotypic culture. Here, we review recent advances and developments in molecular tests for detecting TB as well as anti-TB drug resistance.","MacLean, Emily; Kohli, Mikashmi; Weber, Stefan F; Suresh, Anita; Schumacher, Samuel G; Denkinger, Claudia M; Pai, Madhukar",J. clin. microbiol,,336
362632,Remote management of dental problems in children during and post the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak: A teledentistry approach,2021,"Disruption of health services due to the COVID-19 pandemic threatens to derail progress being made in tuberculosis control efforts. Forcibly displaced people and migrant populations face particular vulnerabilities as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which leaves them at further risk of developing TB. They inhabit environments where measures such as ""physical distancing"" are impossible to realize and where facilities like camps and informal temporary settlements can easily become sites of rapid disease transmission. In this viewpoint we utilize three case studies-from Peru, South Africa, and Syria-to illustrate the lived experience of forced migration and mobile populations, and the impact of COVID-19 on TB among these populations. We discuss the dual pandemics of TB and COVID-19 in the context of migration through a syndemic lens, to systematically address the upstream social, economic, structural and political factors that - in often deleterious dynamics - foster increased vulnerabilities and risk. Addressing TB, COVID-19 and migration from a syndemic perspective, not only draws systematic attention to comorbidity and the relevance of social and structural context, but also helps to find solutions: the true reality of syndemic interactions can only be fully understood by considering a particular population and bio- social context, and ensuring that they receive the comprehensive care that they need. It also provides avenues for strengthening and expanding the existing infrastructure for TB care to tackle both COVID-19 and TB in migrants and refugees in an integrated and synergistic manner.","Knipper, Michael; Sedas, Ana Cristina; Keshavjee, Salmaan; Abbara, Aula; Almhawish, Naser; Alashawi, Hani; Lecca, Leonid; Wilson, Michael; Zumla, Almuddin; Abubakar, Ibrahim; Orcutt, Miriam",Int. j. infect. dis,,336

Hence, we deliver our perspectives and recommendations based on the current situation in Indonesia to enforce their safeties. We encourage stakeholders to implement a systematic approach by employing stringent prevention strategies, ensuring adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) provision and equitable PPE distribution, and routine HCWs screening to prevent nosocomial clusters, in addition to the provision of psychosocial support to HCWs by offering social aids and psychological sessions. Furthermore, social stigma and discrimination toward HCWs and patients should also be addressed and mitigated, thus preventing concealments of patients' history and alleviating emotional burdens. We believe that providing continuous support to HCWs would lead to key benefits in ensuring a winning battle against the COVID-19 pandemic. Relevance for Patients: HCWs are pivotal players in winning the battle against the COVID- 19 pandemic. Ensuring their safety and well-being will enable them to deliver better healthcare services, thus resulting in mutual benefit for themselves, the patients, and the nation's recovery.","Lazarus, G.; Meyer, M.; Depfenhart, M.; Tjahjadi, A.

A global survey has demonstrated that these impacts include an increase in telemedicine consultations, delays in DXA scanning, interruptions in the supply of medications and reductions in parenteral medication delivery. INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has had profound effects on the health of the global population both directly, via the sequelae of the infection, and indirectly, including the relative neglect of chronic disease management. Together the International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation sought to ascertain the impact on osteoporosis management. METHODS: Questionnaires were electronically circulated to a sample of members of both learned bodies and included information regarding the location and specialty of respondents, current extent of face to face consultations, alterations in osteoporosis risk assessment, telemedicine experience, alterations to medication ascertainment and delivery and electronic health record (EHR) utilisation. Responses were collected, quantitative data analysed, and qualitative data assessed for recurring themes. RESULTS: Responses were received from 209 healthcare workers from 53 countries, including 28% from Europe, 24% from North America, 19% from the Asia Pacific region, 17% from the Middle East and 12% from Latin America. Most respondents were physicians (85%) with physician assistants, physical therapists and nurses/nurse practitioners represented in the sample. The main three specialties represented included rheumatology (40%), endocrinology (22%) and orthopaedics (15%). In terms of the type of patient contact, 33% of respondents conducted telephone consultations and 21% video consultations. Bone mineral density assessment by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) usage was affected with only 29% able to obtain a scan as recommended. The majority of clinicians (60%) had systems in place to identify patients receiving parenteral medication, and 43% of clinicians reported difficulty in arranging appropriate osteoporosis medications during the COVID-19 crisis. CONCLUSIONS: To conclude through surveying a global sample of osteoporosis healthcare professionals, we have observed an increase in telemedicine consultations, delays in DXA scanning, interrupted supply of medications and reductions in parenteral medication delivery.","Fuggle, N R; Singer, A; Gill, C; Patel, A; Medeiros, A; Mlotek, A S; Pierroz, D D; Halbout, P; Harvey, N C; Reginster, J-Y; Cooper, C; Greenspan, S L",Osteoporos Int,,336

OBJECTIVE: To assess whether patients undergoing pharmacological treatment for IMID present higher risk of worse outcomes when diagnosed with COVID-19. DESIGN AND SETTING: Rapid systematic review conducted in the medical school of the Federal University of São Paulo (SP), Brazil. METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, SCOPUS, Web of Science, L·OVE, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO-ICTRP for studies evaluating patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who were undergoing pharmacological treatment for IMID. Two authors selected studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias and certainty of evidence, following the Cochrane recommendations. RESULTS: We identified 1,498 references, from which one cohort study was included. This compared patients with and without rheumatic diseases (RD) who all had been diagnosed with COVID-19. Those with RD seemed to have higher chances of hospitalization and mortality, but no statistical difference was detected between the groups: hospitalization: odds ratio (OR) 1.17; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.6 to 2.29; mortality rate: OR 1.53; 95% CI 0.33 to 7.11 (very low certainty of evidence). Patients with RD were three times more likely to require admission to intensive care units (ICUs), with invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), than those without RD: OR 3.72; 95% CI 1.35 to 10.26 (for both outcomes; very low certainty of evidence). CONCLUSION: Patients undergoing pharmacological treatment for IMID seem to present higher chances of requiring admission to ICUs, with IMV. Additional high-quality studies are needed to analyze the effects of different treatments for IMID.","Rocha, Aline Pereira da; Atallah, Álvaro Nagib; Pinto, Ana Carolina Pereira Nunes; Rocha-Filho, César Ramos; Milby, Keilla Martins; Civile, Vinicius Tassoni; Carvas Junior, Nelson; Reis, Felipe Sebastião de Assis; Ferla, Laura Jantsch; Ramalho, Gabriel Sodré; Trevisani, Giulia Fernandes Moça; Puga, Maria Eduarda dos Santos; Trevisani, Virgínia Fernandes Moça",Säo Paulo med. j,,336

Due to this infection, many countries of the world suffers from great economic loss. The researchers around the world are very active to make a plan and policy for its early eradication. The government officials have taken full action for the eradication of this virus using different possible control strategies. It is the first priority of the researchers to develop safe vaccine against this deadly disease to minimize the infection. Different approaches have been made in this regards for its elimination. In this study, we formulate a mathematical epidemic model to analyze the dynamical behavior and transmission patterns of this new pandemic. We consider the environmental viral concentration in the model to better study the disease incidence in a community. Initially, the model is constructed with the derivative of integer-order. The classical epidemic model is then reconstructed with the fractional order operator in the form of Atangana-Baleanu derivative with the nonsingular and nonlocal kernel in order to analyze the dynamics of Coronavirus infection in a better way. A well-known estimation approach is used to estimate model parameters from the COVID-19 cases reported in Saudi Arabia from March 1 till August 20, 2020. After the procedure of parameters estimation, we explore some basic mathematical analysis of the fractional model. The stability results are provided for the disease free case using fractional stability concepts. Further, the uniqueness and existence results will be shown using the Picard-Lendelof approach. Moreover, an efficient numerical scheme has been proposed to obtain the solution of the model numerically. Finally, using the real fitted parameters, we depict many simulation results in order to demonstrate the importance of various model parameters and the memory index on disease dynamics and possible eradication.","Alzahrani, Ebraheem; El-Dessoky, M M; Baleanu, Dumitru",Results Phys,,336

Evaluation of these services is needed to guide future implementation. This mixed-methods study evaluates patient demographics, clinical presentation, co-morbidities, service usage, and outcomes for the Islington COVID-19 service (London, UK) and from April to May 2020 and thematically analyses survey responses from 29 service clinicians and 41 GP referrers on their service experience. Of the 237 patients booked into the service, a significant number of referrals (n = 91; 38.6%) were made after the presumed infectious period of 14 days. Almost half of all adult referrals (49%) were dealt with remotely (via telephone/video consultation +/- remote oxygen saturation monitoring). The service was perceived to provide a safe way to see patients; it developed local expertise, learning, and empowerment; and it was a positive teamworking experience. These findings suggest that the management of many patients with COVID-19 symptoms is possible in routine general practice with minimal risk through the implementation of remote consultation methods and in patients who present after the post-infectious period. Additionally, the use of remote saturation monitoring and local GP COVID-19 ""experts"" can support practices to manage COVID-19 patients. Future primary care COVID-19 services should act as empowerment tools to assist GPs to safely manage their own patients and provide support for GPs in this process.","Hibberd, James; Carter, Jessica; McCoy, Michaella; Rafiq, Meena; Varma, Amita; Sanghera, Rita; Matthews, Philippa; Rait, Greta",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,336

The high technicalities of nasopharyngeal sampling and molecular assays, as well as scarce resources of reagents, limit our testing capabilities. Several strategies failed, to date, to fully alleviate this testing process (e.g. saliva sampling or antigen testing on nasopharyngeal samples). We assessed the clinical performances of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen (N-antigen) ELISA detection in serum or plasma using the COVID-19 Quantigene® (AAZ, France) assay. METHODS: Performances were determined on 63 sera from 63 non-COVID patients and 227 serum samples (165 patients) from the French COVID and CoV-CONTACT cohorts with RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, including 142 serum (114 patients) obtained within 14 days after symptoms' onset. RESULTS: Specificity was 98.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 95.3 to 100). Sensitivity was 79.3% overall (180/227, 95% CI, 74.0 to 84.6) and 93.0% (132/142, 95% CI, 88.7 to 97.2) within 14 days after symptoms onset. 91 included patients had a sera and nasopharyngeal swabs collected in the same 24 hours. Among those with high nasopharyngeal viral loads, i.e. Ct value below 30 and 33, only 1/50 and 4/67 tested negative for N-antigenemia, respectively. Among those with a negative nasopharyngeal RT-PCR, 8/12 presented positive N-antigenemia; the lower respiratory tract was explored for 6 of these 8 patients, showing positive RT-PCR in 5 cases. CONCLUSION: This is the first evaluation of a commercially available serum N-antigen detection assay. It presents a robust specificity and sensitivity within the first 14 days after symptoms onset.

372940,Changes in Outpatient Buprenorphine Dispensing During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"The relationship between outdoor atmospheric pollution by particulate matter and the morbidity and mortality of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections was recently disclosed, yet the role of indoor aerosols is poorly known . Since people spend most of their time indoor, indoor aerosols are closer to human occupants than outdoors, thus favoring airborne transmission of COVID-19. Therefore, here we review the characteristics of aerosol particles emitted from indoor sources, and how exposure to particles affects human respiratory infections and transport of airborne pathogens. We found that tobacco smoking, cooking, vacuum cleaning, laser printing, burning candles, mosquito coils and incenses generate large quantities of particles, mostly in the ultrafine range below 100 nm. These tiny particles stay airborne, are deposited in the deeper regions of human airways and are difficult to be removed by the respiratory system. As a consequence, adverse effects can be induced by inhaled aerosol particles via oxidative stress and inflammation. Early epidemiological evidence and animal studies have revealed the adverse effects of particle exposure in respiratory infections. In particular, inhaled particles can impair human respiratory systems and immune functions, and induce the upregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, thus inducing higher vulnerability to COVID-19 infection. Moreover, co-production of inflammation mediators by COVID-19 infection and particle exposure magnifies the cytokine storm and aggravates symptoms in patients. We also discuss the role of indoor aerosol particles as virus carriers. Although many hypotheses were proposed, there is still few knowledge on interactions between aerosol articles and virus-laden droplets or droplet nuclei.","Chen, Bo; Jia, Puqi; Han, Jie",Environ Chem Lett,,336
373157,Development of a Portuguese COVID-19 imaging repository and database: Learning and sharing knowledge during a pandemic,2020,"Predicting the development of epidemic infection caused by the COVID-19 coronavirus is a matter of the utmost urgency for health care and effective anti-epidemic measures. Given the rapidly changing initial information and the ambiguous quality of data coming from various sources, it is important to quickly optimize the existing prognostic models by using more sophisticated algorithms. The aim of the study is to test the originally developed mathematical algorithms for predicting the development of the COVID-19 epidemic process. Materials and Methods. To assess the situation in China, Italy, and the USA, we used the information from Russian- and Englishlanguage sources available in official websites. The generally accepted descriptive statistics were used; mathematical modeling was based on linear regression. Statistical data processing was performed using the IBM SPSS Statistics 24.0 and R (RStudio) 3.6.0. Results. We found significant differences not only in the incidence rate of COVID-19 in the countries in question, but also in the death rate. The risk of death associated with COVID-19 is high due to the high number of severe clinical cases of the disease reported from these countries. Two preliminary regression models were created. The first, initial model was based on the increase in new cases of infection — this factor was significantly associated with the outcome; the regression coefficient was 0.02 (95% CI 0.01–0.03). In the second, expanded model, in addition to the increase in new cases, the increase in the number of severe forms of infection was also considered; the regression coefficients were 0.017 (95% CI 0.012–0.022) and 0.01 (95% CI 0.008–0.011), respectively. Adding the second variable contributed to a more accurate description of the available data by the model. Conclusion. The developed regression models for infection control and predicting the number of lethal outcomes can be successfully used under conditions of spreading diseases from the group of “new infections” when primary data received from various sourced are changing rapidly and updates of the information are continually required. In addition, our initial model can produce a preliminary assessment of the situation, and the expanded model can increase the accuracy and improve the analytic algorithm.","Melik-Huseynov, D.

In this study, we analyzed the clinical profiles of patients with COVID 19 and acute pancreatitis. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted on Research Patient Data Registry data which was pooled from five Mass General Brigham Healthcare Network hospitals. We extracted data on demographics, symptoms, ICU transfer, mechanical ventilation, laboratories' profiles, imaging findings, and patient outcomes. RESULT: Of 985 screened adult patients, 17 were eligible for the study, 9 (52.9%) were admitted primarily for respiratory failure and developed acute pancreatitis after a median of 22.5 days (13-76 days) from the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. On contrary, eight patients presented with typical symptoms and were diagnosed with acute pancreatitis, the majority with mild severity (62.5%) on admission. Patients who were admitted primarily with severe COVID-19 illness were younger (median age 57 vs. 63 years), females (55.6 vs. 25%), of Hispanic ethnicity (55.6 vs. 25%), and obese (88.9 vs. 37.5%). The median peak lipase, C reactive protein, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer were higher among patients who developed acute pancreatitis later during hospitalization. Patients who developed acute pancreatitis later also experienced higher episodes of necrotizing pancreatitis (11.1% vs. 0), thromboembolic complications (55.6 vs. 12.5%), and higher mortality (37.5 vs. 12.5%). CONCLUSION: Acute pancreatitis is not common among patients with COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 who had acute pancreatitis on admission had more benign course and overall better outcome as compared to the patients who developed acute pancreatitis during hospitalization.","Kumar, Vivek; Barkoudah, Ebrahim; Souza, Daniel A T; Jin, David X; McNabb-Baltar, Julia",Eur J Gastroenterol Hepatol,,336

377467,An Unusual Conversation about Dying during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Neurosurgery Resident's Experience,2021,"Solar Orbiter strives to unveil how the Sun controls and shapes the heliosphere and fills it with energetic particle radiation. To this end, its Energetic Particle Detector (EPD) has now been in operation, providing excellent data, for just over a year. EPD measures suprathermal and energetic particles in the energy range from a few keV up to (near-) relativistic energies (few MeV for electrons and about 500 MeV/nuc for ions). We present an overview of the initial results from the first year of operations and we provide a first assessment of issues and limitations. During this first year of operations of the Solar Orbiter mission, EPD has recorded several particle events at distances between 0.5 and 1 au from the Sun. We present dynamic and time-averaged energy spectra for ions that were measured with a combination of all four EPD sensors, namely: the SupraThermal Electron and Proton sensor (STEP), the Electron Proton Telescope (EPT), the Suprathermal Ion Spectrograph (SIS), and the High-Energy Telescope (HET) as well as the associated energy spectra for electrons measured with STEP and EPT. We illustrate the capabilities of the EPD suite using the 10-11 December 2020 solar particle event. This event showed an enrichment of heavy ions as well as $^3$He, for which we also present dynamic spectra measured with SIS. The high anisotropy of electrons at the onset of the event and its temporal evolution is also shown using data from these sensors. We discuss the ongoing in-flight calibration and a few open instrumental issues using data from the 21 July and the 10-11 December 2020 events and give guidelines and examples for the usage of the EPD data. We explain how spacecraft operations may affect EPD data and we present a list of such time periods in the appendix.

Drawing on a subset of data from a large contemporaneous research study, this report explores the experiences of 36 women students with and without reported pre-existing mental health diagnoses during the first UK lockdown, in spring 2020. Specifically, the data explored self-reported coping with the restrictions, with the abrupt move to online learning, and the loss of support;as well as students' perceived strengths and difficulties in balancing their student role with family roles such as being a partner and/or a parent. Students with a pre-existing mental health diagnosis reported higher levels of loneliness compared to a matched sample of non-students, and more avoidant coping and negative emotional coping than students without a diagnosis. Qualitative data illustrate how parenting intersects with well-being and stress as both a protective and risk factor for women university students. This research report adds to the evidence base on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the student population, and how pre-existing mental health diagnoses intersect with coping behaviours and vulnerability in women students. Exploration of potential vulnerabilities can provide opportunities for targeted support, and identifying effective coping has the potential to inform effective interventions.","Misca, G.; Thornton, G.",Frontiers in Psychology,,336

PURPOSE: In the current study, we evaluated whether recipient preconditioning with different regimens of radiation combined with DSBMI may enhance small bowel allograft survival with minimum recipient morbidity. METHODS: Heterotopic small bowel transplantation (SBTx) was performed with Lewis rats as recipients and DA rats as donors, which were immunossupressed with a short course of tacrolimus (FK 506 ) at 1mg/Kg/day for 5 days and distributed in 4 groups: group 1 (n= 4) without both irradiation and DSBMI; Groups 2 (n= 6), 3 (n= 9) and 4 (n= 6) received 100 x 10(6) DSBM cells at the time of the transplant. Groups 3 and 4 were irradiated with 250 and 400 rd respectively. Animals were examined daily for clinical signs of rejection or GVHD. Blood samples were taken weekly for chimeric studies by FC and intestinal biopsies were performed every 2 weeks. RESULTS: Animals in G1 and G2 had minimal rejection at day 15 after SBTx while GVHD was clinically and histologically characterized in G 3 and G 4. Total chimerism and T-cell chimerism was higher in irradiated groups when compared to non-irradiated groups. With exception of G1 and 2 where rejection was the cause of death, all animals in G3 and 4 died of GVHD. CONCLUSION:We concluded that low cytoreductive of irradiation can successfully decrease the graft rejection but not prevent the occurrence of GVHD.","Bakonyi Neto, Alexandre; Behro, Mariana; Ruiz, Phillip; P.

The threat of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases exists as an imminent threat to human health. It is essential to implement adequate hygiene best practices to break the contagion chain and enhance society preparedness for such critical scenarios and understand the relevance of each disease transmission route. As the unconscious hand-face contact gesture constitutes a potential pathway of contagion, in this paper, the authors present a prototype system based on low-cost depth sensors able to monitor in real-time the attitude towards such a habit. The system records people's behavior to enhance their awareness by providing real-time warnings, providing for statistical reports for designing proper hygiene solutions, and better understanding the role of such route of contagion. A preliminary validation study measured an overall accuracy of 91%. A Cohen's Kappa equal to 0.876 supports rejecting the hypothesis that such accuracy is accidental. Low-cost body tracking technologies can effectively support monitoring compliance with hygiene best practices and training people in real-time. By collecting data and analyzing them with respect to people categories and contagion statistics, it could be possible to understand the importance of this contagion pathway and identify for which people category such a behavioral attitude constitutes a significant risk.","Manghisi, Vito M; Fiorentino, Michele; Boccaccio, Antonio; Gattullo, Michele; Cascella, Giuseppe L; Toschi, Nicola; Pietroiusti, Antonio; Uva, Antonio E",Sensors (Basel),,336
381114,COVID-19: the implications for suicide in older adults,2020,"Background and Aim: This review investigates the role of gastrointestinal and hepatic manifestations in COVID-19, particularly with regard to the prevalence of isolated gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane library for COVID-19 publications from 1 December 2019 to 18 May 2020. We included any study that reported the presence of GI symptoms in a sample of >5 COVID-19 patients. Data collection and risk of bias assessment were performed independently by two reviewers. Where &#8805;3 studies reported data sufficiently similar to allow calculation of a pooled prevalence, we performed random effects meta-analysis. Results: This review included 17 776 COVID-19 patients from 108 studies. Isolated GI symptoms only occurred in 1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0-6%) of patients. GI symptoms were reported in 20% (95% CI 15-24%) of patients. The most common were anorexia (21%, 95% CI 15-27%), diarrhea (13%, 95% CI 11-16%), nausea or vomiting (8%, 95% CI 6-11%), and abdominal pain (4%, 95% CI 2-6%). Transaminase elevations were present in 24% (95% CI 17-31%) of patients. Higher prevalence of GI symptoms were reported in studies published after 1st April, with prevalence of diarrhea 16% (95% CI 13-20), nausea or vomiting 12% (95% CI 8-16%), and any GI symptoms 24% (95% CI 18-34%). GI symptoms were associated with severe COVID-19 disease (odds ratio [OR] 2.1, 95% CI 1.3-3.2), but not mortality (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.52-1.54). Conclusions: Patients with isolated GI symptoms may represent a small but significant portion of COVID-19 cases. When testing resources are abundant, clinicians should still consider testing patients with isolated GI symptoms or unexplained transaminase elevations for COVID-19. More recent studies estimate higher overall GI involvement in COVID-19 than was previously recognized.","Dorrell, Robert D; Dougherty, Michael K; Barash, Eric L; Lichtig, Asher E; Clayton, Steven B; Jensen, Elizabeth T",,,336

Different strategies (e.g., antioxidants) and signaling pathways (e.g., Nrf2) have been identified to help regulate disease progression, nevertheless, there are still missing links that we need to understand. Contact sites called mitochondria-associated membranes (MAM) allow bi-directional communication between organelles as part of the essential functions in the cell to maintain its homeostasis. Different groups have deeply studied the role of MAM in aging; however, it's necessary to analyze their involvement in the progression of age-related diseases. In this review, we highlight the role of contact sites in these conditions, as well as the morphological and functional changes of mitochondria and ER in aging. We emphasize the intimate relationship between both organelles as a reflection of the biological processes that take place in the cell to try to regulate the deterioration characteristic of the aging process; proposing MAM as a potential target to help limit the disease progression with age.","Gil-Hernández, A; Silva-Palacios, A",Ageing Res Rev,,336

Most frequent symptoms were fever and cough followed by dyspnoea, myalgia, odynophagia, headache, anosmia, and diarrhoea. Non-severe patients had more upper respiratory symptoms while severe patients had mainly lower respiratory symptoms on admission. Most common comorbidities were arterial hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. A great proportion of patients had normal thorax X-ray and ground-glass opacity in tomography. In severe patients, radiography and tomography had a predominant ground - glass pattern, but normal radiography and tomography on presentation were present in 22% and 5.9%, respectively. The absence of fever and normal radiology on admission neither excluded the disease nor further severity. PCR elevation was related with COVID-19 disease and with severity, while lymphopenia was more related with the disease and leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia with severity. 8, 4% of patients were health care workers. The mortality rate was 12.4%, 32.7% in severe patients and 61.2% in ventilated patients. Mortality was higher in the public hospital, probably associated with patients with older age and more comorbidities. All these observations can contribute to the knowledge of this disease in terms of diagnosis and prognosis.","Barra, Maria Ana; Medinacelli, Nelson Adolfo Carlos; Padilla, Camilo Andres Meza; Rocco, Lucrecia Di; Larrea, Ramiro Manuel; Gaudenzi, Giuliano; Mastrovincenzo, Veronica Vanesa; Moreno, Ines; Rana, Elisa; Sorvik, Dagmar Ana; Sarlingo, Andrea; Dadomo, Florencia; Torrilla, Miguel",,,336

Scientists and pharmaceutical companies have promptly responded by advancing potential therapeutics into clinical trials at an exponential rate. Initial encouraging results have been realized using remdesivir and dexamethasone. Yet, the research continues so as to identify better clinically relevant therapeutics that act either as prophylactics to prevent the infection or as treatments to limit the severity of COVID-19 and substantially decrease the mortality rate. Previously, we reviewed the potential therapeutics in clinical trials that block the early stage of the viral life cycle. In this review, we summarize potential anti-COVID-19 therapeutics that block/inhibit the post-entry stages of the viral life cycle. The review presents not only the chemical structures and mechanisms of the potential therapeutics under clinical investigation, i.e., listed in clinicaltrials.gov, but it also describes the relevant results of clinical trials. Their anti-inflammatory/immune-modulatory effects are also described. The reviewed therapeutics include small molecules, polypeptides, and monoclonal antibodies. At the molecular level, the therapeutics target viral proteins or processes that facilitate the post-entry stages of the viral infection. Frequent targets are the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and the viral proteases such as papain-like protease (PLpro) and main protease (Mpro). Overall, we aim at presenting up-to-date details of anti-COVID-19 therapeutics so as to catalyze their potential effective use in fighting the pandemic.","Al-Horani, Rami A; Kar, Srabani",Viruses,,336

The tendon-bone assembly characteristics of an ostrich foot were studied by gross anatomy, and the 3D model of ostrich foot was reconstructed and analyzed using reverse engineering techniques. Further, the bionic mechanical foot, suitable for locomotion on loose sand, was designed based on the structural characteristics of ostrich foot and its rigid-flexible coupling mechanism of tendon-bone synergies. The travelling performance on sand of the bionic mechanical foot was tested on a test platform by using Simi Motion. After analyzing the angle changes of the ankle joint and the metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint, the displacement changes of the knee joint, the ankle joint, the MTP joint, and each phalanx along the z-axis, the plantar pressure distribution, and the footprints, we drew the conclusion that the bionic mechanical foot is helpful to reduce the sinkage and improve the trafficability on sand ground.

We aimed to determine the completeness of reporting (COR) for case reports published on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of the PubMed database for all single-patient case reports of confirmed COVID-19 published from Jan. 1 to Apr. 24, 2020. All included case reports were assessed for adherence to the CARE (Case Report) 31-item checklist, which was used to create a composite COR score. The primary outcome was the mean COR score assessed by 2 independent raters. Secondary outcomes included whether there was a change in overall COR score with certain publication factors (e.g., publication date) and whether there was a linear relation between COR and citation count and between COR scores and social media attention. RESULTS: Our search identified 196 studies that were published in 114 unique journals. We found that the overall mean COR score was 54.4%. No one case report included all of the 31 CARE checklist items. There was no significant correlation between COR with either citation count or social media attention. INTERPRETATION: We found that the overall COR for case reports on COVID-19 was poor. We suggest that journals adopt common case-reporting standards to improve reporting quality.","Scaffidi, Michael A; Gimpaya, Nikko; Li, Juana; Bansal, Rishi; Verma, Yash; Elsolh, Karam; Donn, Gemma M; Panjwani, Abhishek; Khan, Rishad; Grover, Samir C",CMAJ Open,,336

The greatest impact that COVID-19 had was on intensive care units (ICUs), given that approximately 20% of hospitalized cases developed acute respiratory failure (ARF) requiring ICU admission. Based on the assumption that COVID-19 represented a viral pneumonia and no anti-coronaviral therapy existed, nearly all national and international health care societies' recommended ""supportive care only"" avoiding other therapies outside of randomized controlled trials, with a specific prohibition against the use of corticosteroids in treatment. However, early studies of COVID-19-associated ARF reported inexplicably high mortality rates, with frequent prolonged durations of mechanical ventilation (MV), even from centers expert in such supportive care strategies. These reports led the authors to form a clinical expert panel called the Front-Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance (www.flccc.net). The panel collaboratively reviewed the emerging clinical, radiographic, and pathological reports of COVID-19 while initiating multiple discussions among a wide clinical network of front-line clinical ICU experts from initial outbreak areas in China, Italy, and New York. Based on the shared early impressions of ""what was working and what wasn't working,"" the increasing medical journal publications and the rapidly accumulating personal clinical experiences with COVID-19 patients, a treatment protocol was created for the hospitalized patients based on the core therapies of methylprednisolone, ascorbic acid, thiamine, heparin and co-interventions (MATH+). This manuscript reviews the scientific and clinical rationale behind MATH+ based on published in-vitro, pre-clinical, and clinical data in support of each medicine, with a special emphasis of studies supporting their use in the treatment of patients with viral syndromes and COVID-19 specifically. The review concludes with a comparison of published multi-national mortality data with MATH+ center outcomes.","Kory, Pierre; Meduri, G Umberto; Iglesias, Jose; Varon, Joseph; Marik, Paul E",J Intensive Care Med,,336

This approach could be rapidly adapted to new and emerging viruses. The first method built and studied a virus-host-physical interaction network; a three-layer multimodal network of drug target proteins, human protein-protein interactions, and viral-host protein-protein interactions. The second method evaluated sequence similarity between viral proteins and other proteins, visualized by constructing a virus-host-similarity interaction network. Methods were validated on the human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and human papillomavirus, then deployed on SARS-CoV-2. Comparison of virus-host-physical interaction predictions to known antiviral drugs had AUCs of 0.69, 0.59, 0.78, and 0.67, respectively, reflecting that the scores are predictive of effective drugs. For SARS-CoV-2, 569 candidate drugs were predicted, of which 37 had been included in clinical trials for SARS-CoV-2 (AUC = 0.75, P-value 3.21 × 10-3). As further validation, top-ranked candidate antiviral drugs were analyzed for binding to protein targets in silico; binding scores generated by BindScope indicated a 70% success rate.","Wang, Mengran; Withers, Johanna B; Ricchiuto, Piero; Voitalov, Ivan; McAnally, Michael; Sanchez, Helia N; Saleh, Alif; Akmaev, Viatcheslav R; Ghiassian, Susan Dina",,,336

METHODS: Eighty cases of COVID-19 diagnosed from January 24 to February 17, 2020 in Beijing YouAn Hospital Affiliated to Capital Medical University were retrospectively analyzed. All 80 patients received symptomatic and supportive treatment. Among them, 44 patients took Jinhua Qinggan granules (treatment group) within 24 h of admission, and the remaining 36 patients either did not take Jinhua Qinggan granules or took the granules for less than 2 d (control group). In this study, we compared the duration of viral nucleic acid detection and of pneumonia absorption improvement between the two groups. RESULTS: Among the 80 cases, 37 were male (46%) and 43 were female (54%) with age ranging from 15 to 86 years, with an average age of 51.19 years. The average duration of viral nucleic acid detection was (7 ± 4) d in the Jinhua Qinggan administration group and (10 ± 4) d for the control group (P = 0.010), following which, nucleic acid tests were negative. Of the two groups, 56.82% in the Jinhua Qinggan treatment group and 27.78% in the control group demonstrated negative nucleic acid tests within 7 d or less. The 7-day viral clearance rate was significantly higher in the Jinhua Qinggan group compared with the control group (P = 0.009). Furthermore, the pneumonia recovery time indicated by chest CT was (8 ± 4) d in the Jinhua Qinggan group, which was significantly shorter than the control group, at (10 ± 5) d (P = 0.021). No adverse reactions were found in the treatment group after taking this medicine. CONCLUSION: In patients with COVID-19, Jinhua Qinggan granules can effectively shorten the duration of nucleic acid detection and promote the absorption of pneumonia inflammatory exudate without obvious adverse reactions.","Liu, Zengli; Li, Xiuhui; Gou, Chunyan; Li, Li; Luo, Xiaolan; Zhang, Chun; Zhang, Yin; Zhang, Jiaying; Jin, Aihua; Li, Hongyan; Zeng, Yuan; Li, Tongzeng; Wang, Xiaoju",J Tradit Chin Med,,336

As of May 14, 2021, we have completed the screening process and arrived at 13 eligible articles to be included in the systematic review. We hope to elicit, summarize, and report the main findings in the systematic review article by the end of August 2021. We expect to uncover facilitators and barriers related to app utility, data security, ease of use, and persuasive design that are deemed important to adoption of contact tracing apps. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the systematic review will help researchers to uncover the gaps in the adoption of contact tracing apps, and decision makers and designers to focus on the principal adoption factors necessary to create better and more effective contact tracing apps.

391499,"Substance Use, Mental Health, and Weight-Related Behaviors During the COVID-19 Pandemic Among Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Patients",2021,"Effective treatment of wastewaters laden with heavy metals is critical to the sustainable social and economic growth of metal recycling villages in Vietnam. Currently, most wastewaters from metal recycling villages in Vietnam are directly discharged, posing great threats to the environment and human health. In this study, a small-scale combined coagulation-membrane filtration treatment of wastewater collected from a metal recycling village in Vietnam was experimentally investigated. The experimental results manifested the technical viability of the combined coagulation-membrane filtration process for the treatment of the heavily polluted metal recycling wastewater for beneficial reuse. In this combined treatment process, coagulation using ferric chloride (FeCl2) served as a pre-treatment prior to the microfiltration (MF)/reverse osmosis (RO) process. Under the optimised conditions, coagulation at the dosage of 0.2 g FeCl2 per 1,000 ml wastewater removed more than 90% of heavy metals (i.e. most notably including aluminium and chromium) from the wastewater, reducing the aluminium and chromium concentrations in the wastewater from 548.0 to 52.3 mg/L to 32.6 and 1.7 mg/L, respectively. The MF treatment of the wastewater following the coagulation further removed suspended solids and organic matters, rendering the wastewater safe for the subsequent RO filtration with respect to membrane fouling. Given the efficient pre-treatment of coagulation and MF, the RO process at the controlled water recovery of 50% was able to effectively treat the wastewater to potable water.","Tran, Lan Thu; Do, Anh Tien; Pham, Tuan Hung; Nguyen, Kim Thanh; Duong, Hung Cong",Water Sci Technol,,336
392404,Working in the emergency and inpatient COVID-19 special wards: A different experience for Iranian psychiatric trainees amid the outbreak,2020,"Non-pharmaceutical interventions are crucial to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic and contain re-emergence phenomena. Targeted measures such as case isolation and contact tracing can alleviate the societal cost of lock-downs by containing the spread where and when it occurs. To assess the relative and combined impact of manual contact tracing (MCT) and digital (app-based) contact tracing, we feed a compartmental model for COVID-19 with high-resolution datasets describing contacts between individuals in several contexts. We show that the benefit (epidemic size reduction) is generically linear in the fraction of contacts recalled during MCT and quadratic in the app adoption, with no threshold effect. The cost (number of quarantines) versus benefit curve has a characteristic parabolic shape, independent of the type of tracing, with a potentially high benefit and low cost if app adoption and MCT efficiency are high enough. Benefits are higher and the cost lower if the epidemic reproductive number is lower, showing the importance of combining tracing with additional mitigation measures. The observed phenomenology is qualitatively robust across datasets and parameters. We moreover obtain analytically similar results on simplified models.","Barrat, A; Cattuto, C; Kivelä, M; Lehmann, S; Saramäki, J",J R Soc Interface,,336
392432,Limiting moral injury in healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"This paper studies how the announcement of the ECB’s monetary policies stopped the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic to the European sovereign debt market. We show that up to March 9, the occurrence of new cases in euro area countries had a sizeable and persistent effect on 10-year sovereign bond spreads relative to Germany: 10 new confirmed cases per million people were accompanied by an immediate spread increase of 0.03 percentage points (ppt) that lasted 5 days, for a total increase of 0.35 ppt. For periods afterwards, the effect falls to near zero and is not significant. We interpret this change as an indicator of the success of the ECB’s March 12 press conference, despite the “we are not here to close spreads” controversy. Our results hold for the stock market, providing further evidence of the effectiveness of the ECB’s March 12 announcements in stopping the financial turmoil. A counterfactual analysis shows that without the shift in the sensitivity of sovereign bond markets to COVID-19, spreads would have surged to 4.2% in France, 12.5% in Spain, and 19.5% in Italy by March 18, when the ECB’s Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme was finally announced.","Ortmans, Aymeric Tripier Fabien",European Economic Review,,336

392605,Evaluation of quality of life and oral hygiene attitudes of individuals using dental prostheses during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"OBJECTIVES: We examined if the WHO International Health Regulations (IHR) capacities were associated with better COVID-19 pandemic control. DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING: Population-based study of 114 countries. PARTICIPANTS: General population. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: For each country, we extracted: (1) the maximum rate of COVID-19 incidence increase per 100,000 population over any 5-day moving average period since the first 100 confirmed cases; (2) the maximum 14-day cumulative incidence rate since the first case; (3) the incidence and mortality within 30 days since the first case and first COVID-19-related death, respectively. We retrieved the 13 country-specific International Health Regulations capacities and constructed linear regression models to examine whether these capacities were associated with COVID-19 incidence and mortality, controlling for the Human Development Index, Gross Domestic Product, the population density, the Global Health Security index, prior exposure to SARS/MERS and Stringency Index. RESULTS: Countries with higher International Health Regulations score were significantly more likely to have lower incidence (ß coefficient -24, 95% CI -35 to -13) and mortality (ß coefficient -1.7, 95% CI -2.5 to -1.0) per 100,000 population within 30 days since the first COVID-19 diagnosis. A similar association was found for the other incidence outcomes. Analysis using different regression models controlling for various confounders showed a similarly significant association. CONCLUSIONS: The International Health Regulations score was significantly associated with reduction in rate of incidence and mortality of COVID-19. These findings inform design of pandemic control strategies, and validated the International Health Regulations capacities as important metrics for countries that warrant evaluation and improvement of their health security capabilities.","Wong, Martin Cs; Huang, Junjie; Wong, Sunny H; Yuen-Chun Teoh, Jeremy",J R Soc Med,,336

392822,Economic evaluation of OT services: Guidance and opportunities,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is challenging advanced health systems, which are dealing with an overwhelming number of patients in need of intensive care for respiratory failure, often requiring intubation. Prone positioning in intubated patients is known to reduce mortality in moderate-to-severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. We aimed to investigate feasibility and effect on gas exchange of prone positioning in awake, non-intubated patients with COVID-19-related pneumonia. METHODS: In this prospective, feasibility, cohort study, patients aged 18-75 years with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19-related pneumonia receiving supplemental oxygen or non-invasive continuous positive airway pressure were recruited from San Gerardo Hospital, Monza, Italy. We collected baseline data on demographics, anthropometrics, arterial blood gas, and ventilation parameters. After baseline data collection, patients were helped into the prone position, which was maintained for a minimum duration of 3 h. Clinical data were re-collected 10 min after prone positioning and 1 h after returning to the supine position. The main study outcome was the variation in oxygenation (partial pressure of oxygen [PaO2]/fractional concentration of oxygen in inspired air [FiO2]) between baseline and resupination, as an index of pulmonary recruitment. This study is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04365959, and is now complete. FINDINGS: Between March 20 and April 9, 2020, we enrolled 56 patients, of whom 44 (79%) were male; the mean age was 57·4 years (SD 7·4) and the mean BMI was 27·5 kg/m2 (3·7). Prone positioning was feasible (ie, maintained for at least 3 h) in 47 patients (83·9% [95% CI 71·7 to 92·4]). Oxygenation substantially improved from supine to prone positioning (PaO2/FiO2 ratio 180·5 mm Hg [SD 76·6] in supine position vs 285·5 mm Hg [112·9] in prone position; p<0·0001). After resupination, improved oxygenation was maintained in 23 patients (50·0% [95% CI 34·9-65·1]; ie, responders); however, this improvement was on average not significant compared with before prone positioning (PaO2/FiO2 ratio 192·9 mm Hg [100·9] 1 h after resupination; p=0·29). Patients who maintained increased oxygenation had increased levels of inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein: 12·7 mg/L [SD 6·9] in responders vs 8·4 mg/L [6·2] in non-responders; and platelets: 241·1â×â103/µL [101·9] vs 319·8â×â103/µL [120·6]) and shorter time between admission to hospital and prone positioning (2·7 days [SD 2·1] in responders vs 4·6 days [3·7] in non-responders) than did those for whom improved oxygenation was not maintained. 13 (28%) of 46 patients were eventually intubated, seven (30%) of 23 responders and six (26%) of 23 non-responders (p=0·74). Five patients died during follow-up due to underlying disease, unrelated to study procedure. INTERPRETATION: Prone positioning was feasible and effective in rapidly ameliorating blood oxygenation in awake patients with COVID-19-related pneumonia requiring oxygen supplementation. The effect was maintained after resupination in half of the patients. Further studies are warranted to ascertain the potential benefit of this technique in improving final respiratory and global outcomes.

METHODS: This retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted among patients admitted from March to August 2020 in a referral hospital, Tehran, Iran. All patients aged 18-65 who had not any comorbidity participated in the study. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was established using the rRT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Then the incidence of lung involvement and biochemical markers including vitamin D level, c-reactive protein, D-dimer, lymphocyte count, platelet count, white blood cell count, and lactic acid dehydrogenase, were extracted through medical records. RESULTS: Altogether, 84 patients met our study criteria, and the information of 68 (80.9%) participants were collected. Among all 68 patients, 45 (66.2%) were male. The mean (SD) age of all participants was 52.4 (10.4) years old. Among 24 (35.2%) clients who died due to SARS-CoV-2, 20 (83.3%) patients were male (p=0.02). The mean (SD) of vitamin D level was 24.1 (13.6) ng/dL. No association between vitamin D level and prognostic factors, including CRP, lymphocyte count, D-dimer, LDH, and HRCT scan score, was observed. Also, the vitamin D level of the dead patients was not significantly different from that of the treated patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicated no significant relationship between vitamin D level and prognostic factors or outcomes of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.","Haghighi, Mehrdad; Ebadi, Seyed Shayan; Soleimantabar, Hussein; Shadkam, Atefe; Ebadi, Seyed Alireza; Afzali, Hasan",Horm. mol. biol. clin. investig.

395645,Follow the Money: Childhood Health Care Disparities Magnified by COVID-19,2021,"We present a novel algorithm that is able to classify COVID-19 pneumonia from CT Scan slices using a very small sample of training images exhibiting COVID-19 pneumonia in tandem with a larger number of normal images. This algorithm is able to achieve high classification accuracy using as few as 10 positive training slices (from 10 positive cases), which to the best of our knowledge is one order of magnitude fewer than the next closest published work at the time of writing. Deep learning with extremely small positive training volumes is a very difficult problem and has been an important topic during the COVID-19 pandemic, because for quite some time it was difficult to obtain large volumes of COVID-19 positive images for training. Algorithms that can learn to screen for diseases using few examples are an important area of research. We present the Cycle Consistent Segmentation Generative Adversarial Network (CCS-GAN). CCS-GAN combines style transfer with pulmonary segmentation and relevant transfer learning from negative images in order to create a larger volume of synthetic positive images for the purposes of improving diagnostic classification performance. The performance of a VGG-19 classifier plus CCS-GAN was trained using a small sample of positive image slices ranging from at most 50 down to as few as 10 COVID-19 positive CT-scan images. CCS-GAN achieves high accuracy with few positive images and thereby greatly reduces the barrier of acquiring large training volumes in order to train a diagnostic classifier for COVID-19.","Menon, Sumeet; Mangalagiri, Jayalakshmi; Galita, Josh; Morris, Michael; Saboury, Babak; Yesha, Yaacov; Yesha, Yelena; Nguyen, Phuong; Gangopadhyay, Aryya; Chapman, David",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.01605v1.pdf,336

BACKGROUND: Midwives provide care to childbearing women across the continuum and are key members of the maternity workforce in Australia. AIM: To explore and describe midwives' experiences of providing maternity care during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. METHODS: A two-phased cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted. Data were collected through an online survey and semi-structured interviews between May-June 2020. FINDINGS: Six hundred and twenty midwives responded to the online survey. Many reported a move to telehealth appointments. For labour care, 70% of midwives reported women had limited support; 77% indicated postnatal visiting was impacted. Five main themes were derived from the qualitative data including: coping with rapid and radical changes, challenges to woman-centred care, managing professional resilience, addressing personal and professional challenges, and looking ahead. DISCUSSION: Restrictions applied to women's choices, impacted midwives' ability to provide woman-centred care, which resulted in stress and anxiety for midwives. Professional resilience was supported through collaborative relationships and working in continuity models. Midwives revealed 'silver linings' experienced in providing care during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Findings provide valuable evidence to understand the impact on midwives who have provided care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Knowledge will be useful for health leaders and policy makers as they consider ways to continue care during the pandemic and support the essential midwifery workforce. Recommendations are presented to improve preparedness for future pandemics.","Bradfield, Zoe; Hauck, Yvonne; Homer, Caroline S E; Sweet, Linda; Wilson, Alyce N; Szabo, Rebecca A; Wynter, Karen; Vasilevski, Vidanka; Kuliukas, Lesley",Women and birth (Online),,336

We enrolled 5,000 participants from Taiwan Biobank for this GWAS. After excluding participants with diabetes mellitus and quality control, association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with log-transformed FGF21 and FGF23 serum concentrations adjusted for age, sex and principal components of ancestry were analyzed. A second model additionally adjusted for body mass index (BMI) and a third model additionally adjusted for BMI and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were used. A total of 4,201 participants underwent GWAS analysis. rs67327215, located within RGS6 (a gene involved in fatty acid synthesis), and two other SNPs (rs12565114 and rs9520257, located between PHC2-ZSCAN20 and ARGLU1-FAM155A respectively) showed suggestive associations with serum FGF21 level (P = 6.66 × 10-7, 6.00 × 10-7 and 6.11 × 10-7 respectively).

However, with the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopia, disruptions in routine health care pose a significant risk in reversing the gains made in neonatal mortality reduction. METHODS: Using the World Health Organization's health systems building blocks framework we examined the mechanisms by which the pandemic may impact neonatal health. RESULTS: Our analysis suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken by the government to control its spread could indirectly set back the gains made in neonatal mortality reduction in Ethiopia by weakening the health system building blocks. On the other hand, by exposing longstanding issues in the health system, the pandemic has pressed health sector stakeholders to urgently test innovative approaches to maintain delivery of essential health care. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend that the Ministry of Health of Ethiopia strike a right balance between the control of the pandemic and ensuring provision of essential neonatal health services. As the pandemic continues to spread in the country, the government should avoid verticalization of pandemic response efforts and adopt a diagonal investment approach to effectively respond to the pandemic as well as build health system resilience to maintain the gains made in the neonatal health.","Estifanos, Abiy Seifu; Kazmi, Kescha; Morris, Shaun K",Matern Child Health J,,336

402858,Validity and reliability of the Self-Care Activities Screening Scale (SASS-14) during COVID-19 lockdown,2021,"BACKGROUND: Sudden loss of smell and/or taste has been suggested to be an early marker of COVID-19 infection, with most findings based on self-reporting of sensory changes at a single time point. OBJECTIVE: To understand the onset, severity, and recovery of sensory changes associated with COVID-19 infection, this study will longitudinally track changes in chemosensory acuity among people with suspected COVID-19 infection using standardized test stimuli that are self-administered over 28 days. METHODS: In a prospective, case-controlled observational study, volunteers will be recruited when they present for COVID-19 screening by respiratory tract polymerase chain reaction test (""swab test""). The volunteers will initially complete a series of questionnaires to record their recent changes in smell and taste ability, followed by a brief standardized smell and taste test. Participants will receive a home-use smell and taste test kit to prospectively complete daily self-assessments of their smell and taste acuity at their place of residence for up to 4 weeks, with all data submitted for collection through web-based software. RESULTS: This study has been approved by the Domain Specific Review Board of the National Healthcare Group, Singapore, and is funded by the Biomedical Research Council Singapore COVID-19 Research Fund. Recruitment began on July 23, 2020, and will continue through to March 31, 2021. As of October 2, 2020, 69 participants had been recruited. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this study will be the first to collect longitudinal data on changes to smell and taste sensitivity related to clinically diagnosed COVID-19 infection, confirmed by PCR swab test, in a population-based cohort. The findings will provide temporal insights on the onset, severity, and recovery of sensory changes with COVID-19 infection, the consistency of symptoms, and the frequency of full smell recovery among patients with COVID-19. This self-administered and cost-effective approach has many advantages over self-report questionnaire-based methods and provides a more objective measure of smell and taste changes associated with COVID-19 infection; this will encourage otherwise asymptomatic individuals who are potential spreaders of the virus to self-isolate and seek formal medical diagnosis if they experience a sudden change in sensory acuity. This broadened case finding can potentially help control the COVID-19 pandemic and reduce the emergence of clusters of infections.

SARS-CoV-2 is highly infectious with a high basic reproduction number (R0 ) of 2.2-5.7 that has led to its exponential spread. Besides, very little is known about it in terms of immunogenicity and its molecular targets. SARS-CoV-2 causes acute respiratory distress syndrome, followed by multiple organ failure and death in a small percentage of individuals. Cardiac injury has emerged as another dreaded outcome of COVID-19 complications. However, a thorough understanding of the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 is lacking. In this review, we discuss the virus, possible mechanisms of COVID-19-induced cardiac injury, and potential therapeutic strategies, and we explore if exosomes could be targeted to treat symptoms of COVID-19.

407308,Intradermal Vaccination: A Potential Tool in the Battle Against the COVID-19 Pandemic?,2021,"A voltammetric genosensor has been developed for the early diagnosis of COVID-19 by determination of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) sequence as a specific target of novel coronavirus. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) uses an RdRP for the replication of its genome and the transcription of its genes. Here, the silver ions (Ag+) in the hexathia-18-crown-6 (HT18C6) were used for the first time as a redox probe. Then, the HT18C6(Ag) incorporated carbon paste electrode (CPE) was further modified with chitosan and PAMAM dendrimer-coated silicon quantum dots (SiQDs@PAMAM) for immobilization of probe sequences (aminated oligonucleotides). The current intensity of differential pulse voltammetry using the redox probe was found to decrease with increasing the concentration of target sequence. Based on such signal-off trend, the proposed genosensor exhibited a good linear response to SARS-CoV-2 RdRP in the concentration range 1.0 pM-8.0 nM with a regression equation I (µA) = - 6.555 log [RdRP sequence] (pM) + 32.676 (R2 = 0.995) and a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.3 pM. The standard addition method with different spike concentrations of RdRP sequence in human sputum samples showed a good recovery for real sample analysis (> 95%). Therefore, the developed voltammetric genosensor can be used to determine SARS-CoV-2 RdRP sequence in sputum samples. PAMAM-functionalized SiQDs were used as a versatile electrochemical platform for the SARS-CoV-2 RdRP detection based on a signal off sensing strategy. In this study, for the first time, the silver ions (Ag+) in the hexathia-18-crown-6 carrier were applied as an electrochemical probe.","Farzin, Leila; Sadjadi, Sodeh; Sheini, Azarmidokht; Mohagheghpour, Elham",Mikrochim Acta,,336
407468,Telemedicine in Assistance to Healthcare in the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"Crowds are a source of transmission in the COVID-19 spread. Contention and mitigation measures have focused on reducing people's mass gathering. Such efforts have led to a drop in the economy. The application of a vaccine at a world level represents a grand challenge for humanity, and it is not likely to accomplish even within months. In the meantime, we still need tools to allow the people integration into their regular routines reducing the risk of infection. In this context, this paper presents a solution for crowd management. The aim is to monitor and manage crowd levels in interior places or point-of-interests (POI), particularly shopping centers or stores. The solution is based on a POI recommendation system that suggests the nearest safe options upon request of a particular POI to visit by the user. In this sense, it recommends places near the user location with the least estimated crowd. The recommendation algorithm uses a top-K approach and behavioral game theory to predict the user's choice and estimate the crowd level for the requested POI. To evaluate the efficiency of this technological intervention in terms of the potential number of contacts of possible COVID-19 infections and the recommendation quality, we have developed an agent-based model (ABM). The adoption level of new technologies can be related to the end-user experience and trust in such technologies. As the end-user follows a recommendation that leads to uncrowded places, both the end-user experience and trust increased. We study and model this process using the OCEAN model of personality. The results from the studied scenarios showed that the proposed solution is widely adopted by the agents, as the trust factor increased from 0.5 (initial set value) to 0.76. In terms of crowd level, these are effectively managed and reduced on average by 40%. The mobility contacts were reduced by 40%, decreasing the risk of COVID-19 infection. An APP has been designed to support the described crowd management and contact tracing functionality.

Secondary data for daily meteorological variables and COVID-19 cases from March 8 to May 31, 2020, were collected from the Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD) and Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR). Distributed lag nonlinear models, Pearson's correlation coefficient and wavelet transform coherence were employed to appraise the relationship between meteorological factors and COVID-19 cases. Significant coherence between meteorological variables and COVID-19 at various time-frequency bands has been identified in this work. The results showed that the minimum (MinT) and mean temperature, wind speed (WS), relative humidity (RH) and absolute humidity (AH) had a significant positive correlation while contact transmission had no direct association with the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases. When the MinT was 18 °C, the relative risk (RR) was the highest as 1.04 (95%CI 1.01-1.06) at lag day 11. For the WS, the highest RR was 1.03 (95% CI 1.00-1.07) at lag day 0, when the WS was 21 km/h. When RH was 46%, the highest RR was 1.00 (95% CI 0.98-1.01) at lag day 14. When AH was 23 g/m3, the highest RR was 1.05 (95% CI 1.01-1.09) at lag day 14. We found a profound effect of meteorological factors on SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

Influenza and coronavirus pandemics are zoonoses that spread rapidly in consistent seasonal patterns during an initial wave of infection and subsequent waves of spread. For all of their differences in the state of available medical technologies, global population changes, and social and geopolitical factors surrounding each pandemic, there are remarkable similarities among them. While vaccination of high-risk groups is advocated as an instrumental mode of interrupting pandemics, non-pharmacological interventions including avoidance of mass gatherings, school closings, case isolation, contact tracing, and the implementation of infection prevention strategies in healthcare settings represent the cornerstone to halting transmission. In conjunction with lessons learned from previous pandemics, the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic constitutes the basis for delineating best practices to confront future pandemics.","Mujica, Graciela; Sternberg, Zane; Solis, Jamie; Wand, Taylor; Carrasco, Peter; Henao-Martínez, Andrés F; Franco-Paredes, Carlos",,,336

Moreover, based on the Cox proportional-hazards models before or after propensity score matching, we demonstrated that tocilizumab treatment could lessen mortality by gradually alleviating excessive inflammation and meanwhile continuously enhancing the levels of lymphocytes within 14 days for severe/critical COVID-19 patients, indicating potential effectiveness for treating COVID-19.","Hu, Qin; Xu, Yu; Xiang, Ying; Wang, Bin; Yuan, Zhiquan; Shan, Yifan; Zhang, Wenjing; Wu, Na; Xia, Tingting; Li, Chengying; Xie, Weijia; Jia, Xiaoyue; Yu, Zubin; Bai, Li; Li, Yafei",Int J Biol Sci,,336
408800,The psychological impact of covid-19 outbreak on nurses working in iran,2021,"Polluted air poses a significant threat to human health. Exposure to particulate matter (PM) and harmful gases contributes to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, including allergies and obstructive lung disease. Air pollution may also be linked to cancer and reduced life expectancy. Uptake of PM has been shown to cause pathological changes in the intestinal microbiota in mice and humans. Less is known about the effects of pollution-associated microbiota on human health. Several recent studies described the microbiomes of urban and rural air samples, of the stratosphere and sand particles, which can be transported over long distances, as well as the air of indoor environments. Here, we summarize the current knowledge on airborne bacterial, viral, and fungal communities and discuss their potential consequences on human health. The current data suggest that bacterial pathogens are typically too sparse and short-lived in air to pose a significant risk for infecting healthy people. However, airborne fungal spores may exacerbate allergies and asthma. Little information is available on viruses including phages, and future studies are likely to detect known and novel viruses with a yet unknown impact on human health. Furthermore, varying experimental protocols have been employed in the recent microbiome and virome studies. Therefore, standardized methodologies will be required to allow for better comparisons between studies. Air pollution has been linked to more severe outcomes of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infections. This may have contributed to severe SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, especially those in China, Northern Italy, Iran, and New York City.","Moelling, Karin; Broecker, Felix",J Environ Public Health,,336

In recent years, the rise of video gameplay is unprecedented, further triggered by the lockdown imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper presents an end-to-end stress analysis for video gaming stimuli using EEG. The PSD value of the Alpha and Beta bands is computed to calculate the Beta-to-Alpha ratio (BAR). In this article, BAR is used to denote mental stress. Subjects are chosen based on various factors such as gender, gameplay experience, age, and BMI. EEG is recorded using Scan SynAmps2 Express equipment. There are three types of video gameplay: strategic, puzzle, and combinational. Relaxation is accomplished in this study by the use of music of various pitches. Two types of regression analysis are done to mathematically model stress and relaxation curve. Brain topography is rendered to indicate the stressed and relaxed region of the brain. In the relaxed state, the subjects have BAR 0.701, which is considered the baseline value.

408970,The association of being in quarantine and related COVID-19 recommended and non-recommended behaviors with psychological distress in Chinese population,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is easily transmitted from person to person, which has fueled the ongoing pandemic. Governments in different countries have taken drastic actions such as complete lockdown. However, little attention has been paid to food safety and its potential linkage with the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 spread from staff to food products or food surfaces is conceivable. At least, instead of consuming unpackaged or uncovered foods, consumption of boiled or canned foods processed at high temperatures should be preferred. Before consumption, consumers should clean the surface of canned foods. In addition to recommending or enforcing simple precautions, such as using masks, governments must conduct mandatory SARS-CoV-2 tests regularly and intermittently for personnel who handle food materials or supporting materials (e.g., plastic pouches). Local markets, such as those in Wuhan, which sell live animals and exotic foods for consumption, are a concern. Trade of exotic or wild animals, unhygienic marketplace conditions, and not cooking at high temperatures ought to be prohibited. The consumption of vitamins, minerals, and other food-derived compounds such as omega fatty acids is a prudent way to improve the performance of the immune system. In addition, nano-encapsulated materials with controlled release properties may be useful in protecting food products and packaging from SARS-CoV-2 contamination.","Ceylan, Zafer; Meral, Raciye; Cetinkaya, Turgay",VirusDisease,,336
409020,COVID-19: Health prevention and control in non-healthcare settings,2020,"Respiratory viruses are the main agents causing respiratory tract diseases. Nowadays, coronaviruses - and specifically, SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 - are the principal responsible for the major epidemic outbreaks of the 21st century. The major routes of transmission for respiratory viruses - including coronaviruses - are via direct and indirect contacts. However, transmission through contaminated foods has not been extensively assessed. The present paper was aimed at reviewing scientific data on the transmission of respiratory viruses through potentially contaminated foods. While the current data seem to suggest that this route of transmission is not likely to occur, in order to increase the knowledge on this issue further investigations are still clearly necessary for a more complete prevention of the risks. Studies should include fresh produce and cooked foods. Anyway, prevention measures and good hygienic practices for both consumers and workers are mandatory when handling and cooking foods.","González, Neus; Marquès, Montse; Domingo, José L",Environ Res,,336

409672,Alcohol and Short-Run Mortality: Evidence from a Modern-Day Prohibition (preprint),2020,"Respiratory cilia are the driving force of the mucociliary escalator, working in conjunction with secreted airway mucus to clear inhaled debris and pathogens from the conducting airways. Respiratory cilia are also one of the first contact points between host and inhaled pathogens. Impaired ciliary function is a common pathological feature in patients with chronic airway diseases, increasing susceptibility to respiratory infections. Common respiratory pathogens, including viruses, bacteria, and fungi, have been shown to target cilia and/or ciliated airway epithelial cells, resulting in a disruption of mucociliary clearance that may facilitate host infection. Despite being an integral component of airway innate immunity, the role of respiratory cilia and their clinical significance during airway infections are still poorly understood. This review examines the expression, structure, and function of respiratory cilia during pathogenic infection of the airways. This review also discusses specific known points of interaction of bacteria, fungi, and viruses with respiratory cilia function. The emerging biological functions of motile cilia relating to intracellular signaling and their potential immunoregulatory roles during infection will also be discussed.","Kuek, Li Eon; Lee, Robert J",Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol,,336

Studies have shown that Viral titres peak within the first week of symptoms but may decline later hampering RT-PCR-based diagnostic strategies. Exact estimate is difficult under high-risk screening strategy with evidences of having large number of asymptomatic cases.

Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study with a sample size of 7000 was conducted for 15 days including all the 85 wards under Indore Municipal Corporation. Stratified Random Sampling was used to collect the samples. Trained teams collected basic socio-demographic information and serum samples which were tested for the presence of specific antibodies to COVID-19 using ICMR-Kavach IgG ELISA kits.

411134,Treatment and prevention strategies for patients with gynecological malignancies during the covid-19 pandemic,2020,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is shining a spotlight on health disparities that have long been overlooked in our society. The intersection between Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs), longstanding health disparities, and COVID-19 cannot be ignored. The accumulation of traumatic events throughout the childhood and adolescent years can cause toxic stress in the absence of supportive adults. This repetitive activation of the stress response system can be a catalyst to long-term, negative effects on both the body and brain. A major factor to appreciate is that ACEs do not affect all populations equally. ACEs disproportionately affect groups that have been historically oppressed. The current COVID-19 pandemic highlights this point when observing both case rates and fatality rates of the virus and has the potential to create a new series of long-term health conditions that will disproportionately affect marginalized communities. A foundational first and critical step of adopting a trauma-informed approach will help lead to system change, advance equity, and create a setting of mutuality and empowerment for our patients.","Sonu, Stan; Marvin, David; Moore, Charles",J Child Adolesc Trauma,,336

412210,Mechanical-Ventilation Supply and Options for the COVID-19 Pandemic. Leveraging All Available Resources for a Limited Resource in a Crisis,2021,"Virus host shifts are generally associated with novel adaptations to exploit the cells of the new host species optimally. Surprisingly, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has apparently required little to no significant adaptation to humans since the start of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and to October 2020. Here we assess the types of natural selection taking place in Sarbecoviruses in horseshoe bats versus the early SARS-CoV-2 evolution in humans. While there is moderate evidence of diversifying positive selection in SARS-CoV-2 in humans, it is limited to the early phase of the pandemic, and purifying selection is much weaker in SARS-CoV-2 than in related bat Sarbecoviruses. In contrast, our analysis detects evidence for significant positive episodic diversifying selection acting at the base of the bat virus lineage SARS-CoV-2 emerged from, accompanied by an adaptive depletion in CpG composition presumed to be linked to the action of antiviral mechanisms in these ancestral bat hosts. The closest bat virus to SARS-CoV-2, RmYN02 (sharing an ancestor about 1976), is a recombinant with a structure that includes differential CpG content in Spike; clear evidence of coinfection and evolution in bats without involvement of other species. While an undiscovered ""facilitating"" intermediate species cannot be discounted, collectively, our results support the progenitor of SARS-CoV-2 being capable of efficient human-human transmission as a consequence of its adaptive evolutionary history in bats, not humans, which created a relatively generalist virus.","MacLean, Oscar A; Lytras, Spyros; Weaver, Steven; Singer, Joshua B; Boni, Maciej F; Lemey, Philippe; Kosakovsky Pond, Sergei L; Robertson, David L",PLoS Biol,,336

To date, clinical trials of many vaccine and other viral protease inhibitors (PI) are currently under investigation. Undoubtedly, there are chances of possible side effects and ineffectiveness. Thus, the search for natural bio-active molecules is of great interest that will exert antiviral activity as well as have least chances of toxicity. Fungi are considered as bio-enriched source of producing antiviral compounds. This study is focused on identifying potential fungal derived antiviral molecules with good binding affinity against SARS-CoV-2 MPro using molecular docking. Semicochliodinol B was identified as the best lead molecule with higher binding affinity (− 8. 9 kcal/mol) as compared to the co-crystalized ligand (− 8. 5 kcal/mol). The results of molecular docking confirm the hydrogen bond interaction of Semicochliodinol B with Glu166 and Asn142 as well as hydrophobic interactions with 20 amino acid residues of SARS-CoV-2 MPro. Semicochliodinol B also exhibited good binding affinity against SARS-CoV MPro and Middle east respiratory syndrome-related corona virus (MERS-CoV MPro), suggesting its broad-spectrum activity. Druglikeness, Absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion (ADME) and toxicity studies also directed that Semicochliodinol B may become a promising drug candidate and thus it can be further investigated as a potential inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 MPro. Virtual screening was done on fungal-derived antivirals to identify SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitors. Semicochliodinol B was identified as a promising lead candidate considering binding affinity and interactions obtained in molecular docking. Broad spectrum antiviral activity of Semicochliodinol B is reported. In-silico ADME and toxicity study suggested druglikeness of selected lead Semicochliodinol B.

Although usually given in the s.c. form, previous anecdotal reports have emphasized its utility when given i.v. Our aim is to report our experience on the beneficial effects of anakinra i.v. in patients with SARS-CoV-2 and evidence of hyperinflammation. Methods: We report four patients with severe COVID-19 infection requiring intensive care admission and ventilatory support. Results: All four patients showed evidence of deterioration, with hyperferritinaemia and increasing oxygen requirements and with superadded bacterial infections. Upon commencement of anakinra i.v., there was subsequent improvement in the patients clinically, with reduction in ventilatory support and inotropic support, and biochemically, with rapid improvement in inflammatory markers. Conclusion: Anakinra is safe to use i.v. in patients with COVID-19 and evidence of superadded bacterial infection. Although its utility has not been confirmed in a randomized trial, current research in the COVID-19 pandemic aims to establish the utility of immunosuppression, including IL-1 blockade, on the outcomes of patients with moderate to severe disease. Our case series supports its use in patients with severe, life-threatening COVID-19 and evidence of hyperinflammation.","Clark, Kristina E N; Collas, Oliver; Lachmann, Helen; Singh, Animesh; Buckley, Jim; Bhagani, Sanjay",Rheumatol Adv Pract,,336

Early reports document substantially higher case fatality rates for HCT recipients than seen in faced by the general population. Currently we do not have a clear picture of how much of this threat is present within the first year after HCT and how infection rates and outcomes vary with time after HCT. There are important because center-specific survival estimates for reporting purposes focus on 1-year post-HCT mortality. Transplantation centers have dramatically changed their practices in response to the pandemic. At many centers, quality assurance processes and procedures were disrupted, changes that likely affected team performance. Centers have been affected unevenly by the pandemic through time, location, and COVID-19 burdens. Assessment of center-specific survival depends on the ability to adjust for risk factors, such as COVID-19, that are outside center control using consistent methods so that team performance based on controllable risk factors can be ascertained. The Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplantation Research (CIBMTR) convened a working group for the 2020 Center Outcomes Forum to assess the impact of COVID-19 on both patient-specific risks and center-specific performance. This committee reviewed the factors at play and developed recommendations for a process to determine whether adjustments in the methodology to assess center-specific performance are needed.","Wingard, John R; Ahn, Kwang Woo; Dandoy, Christopher; Perales, Miguel-Angel; Wood, William A; Logan, Brent; Riches, Marcie; Rizzo, J Douglas",Transplant Cell Ther,,336

414539,"[New onset obsessive compulsive disorder due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a case report]",2020,"Significant portions of the world's forests have been impacted by severe and large-scale tree declines characterised by gradual but widespread loss of vigour and subsequent death of either single or several tree species. Tree deaths represent a threat for fauna that are dependent on forest habitats for their survival. Although tree declines have received considerable scientific attention, surprisingly, little is known about their impacts on fauna. In total, we calculated 631 effect sizes across 59 studies that quantified the impact of tree declines on animal abundance. Data representing 186 bird species indicated an overall increase in bird abundance in response to tree declines (meta-analysis mean ± estimation g = 0.172 ± 0.053 [CI 0.069 to 0.275], P = 0.001); however, there was substantial variability in responses (significant heterogeneity P < 0.001) with a strong influence of diet as well as nesting guild on bird responses. Granivores (especially ground-foraging species, e.g. Passerellidae species), bark-foraging insectivores (e.g. woodpeckers), as well as ground- and cavity-nesting species apparently benefitted from tree declines, while nectarivorous birds [and, although not significant, aerially foraging insectivores (e.g. flycatchers) and leaf-gleaning insectivores (canopy-feeding)] were less common in the presence of tree declines. Data representing 33 mammal species indicate a tendency for detrimental effects of tree declines on mammals that use trees as refuges, while aerial foragers (i.e. bats) may benefit from opening up the canopy. Overall the average effect for mammals was neutral (meta-analysis mean estimation g = -0.150 ± 0.145 [-0.433 to 0.134], P = 0.302). Data representing 20 reptile species showed an insufficient range of responses to determine any diet or foraging effect on their responses. Data for 28 arthropod taxa should be considered with caution, as we could not adequately separate taxa according to their specialisations and reliance on key habitat. The data broadly suggest a detrimental effect of tree declines (meta-analysis mean estimation g = -0.171 ± 0.072 [-0.311 to -0.031], P = 0.017) with ground-foraging arthropods (e.g. detritivores and predators such as spiders and centipedes) more likely to be detrimentally impacted by tree declines. The range of responses to tree declines signifies substantially altered animal communities. In many instances, altered ecosystem function due to loss of key animal services will represent a significant threat to forest health.","Fleming, Patricia A; Wentzel, Jacobus J; Dundas, Shannon J; Kreplins, Tracey L; Craig, Michael D; Hardy, Giles E St J",Biol. rev. camb.

The trials have small sample sizes, so estimates of treatment effects are imprecise. Seeing imprecision, clinicians reading research articles may find it difficult to decide when to treat patients with experimental drugs. Whatever decision criterion one uses, there is always some probability that random variation in trial outcomes will lead to prescribing sub-optimal treatments. A conventional practice when comparing standard care and an innovation is to choose the innovation only if the estimated treatment effect is positive and statistically significant. This practice defers to standard care as the status quo. To evaluate decision criteria, we use the concept of near-optimality, which jointly considers the probability and magnitude of decision errors. An appealing decision criterion from this perspective is the empirical success rule, which chooses the treatment with the highest observed average patient outcome in the trial. Considering the design of recent and ongoing COVID-19 trials, we show that the empirical success rule yields treatment results that are much closer to optimal than those generated by prevailing decision criteria based on hypothesis tests.","Manski, Charles F.; Tetenov, Aleksey",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.00343v1.pdf,336

421375,Exposure to COVID-19 pandemic stress: Associations with depression and anxiety in emerging adults in the United States,2020,"Introduction: As coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) spread worldwide and social restrictions were intensified, difficulties in blood supply were expected to result in a shortage of blood donors, logistic issues and a change in blood consumption. Consequences could be detrimental to the meeting of the blood supply demand, especially in a decentralized blood bank in the State of São Paulo responsible for providing blood to more than 100 hospitals, mostly of the public health system. Aiming to minimize negative effects and focusing on maintenance of the blood supply, a different approach was discussed and adopted. Materials and Methods: Briefly, strategies were related to monitoring and promoting measures to achieve a positive RBC unit balance. Thus, the number of donors, transfusions, RBC unit inventory, RBC unit loss and RBC units within up to 5 days from the expiration date were evaluated. Results: Several strategies were adopted to ensure sufficient availability of RBC units: blood donation was improved with social media and extra blood collections, a restrictive transfusion protocol was implemented, a new logistic process to use RBC units closer to the expiration date was established and non-isogroup transfusions were avoided. Conclusion: Altogether, described strategies were crucial to optimize blood storage during the pandemic. Investing in monitoring and logistics contributed to a positive RBC unit balance and conserving these strategies could be useful.","Costa, Cristiano Batista; Cortez, Afonso José Pereira; Adão, Daiane Daniela; de Almeida, Carolina Maganha; Taguchi, Ellen Mari; de Oliveira, Ingrid; Santos, Janaína Fernanda de Oliveira; da Rosa, Ana Paula Rodrigues; Tokunaga, Juliana Trapanotto da Silva; Arnoni, Carine Prisco; Latini, Flavia Roche Moreira",,,336
422836,End of life in the time of COVID-19 pandemic: take care of death,2020,"BACKGROUND: Buprenorphine-based medication-assisted treatment (B-MAT) is a powerful, concrete intervention that can be provided by nurse practitioners (NPs) to reduce opioid-related overdoses in patients with opioid use disorder (OUD). However, multiple barriers exist to provide and access this therapy. LOCAL PROBLEM: A rural Midwestern county struggled with increasing OUD and scant access to B-MAT. A nurse-led, community clinic had the potential to expand access to treatment but no support structure to provide it. METHODS: In this quality improvement project, a one-group posttest-only design was used to assess treatment access, care quality, and patient characteristics. INTERVENTIONS: An evidence-based, nurse led weekly B-MAT clinic using a low-threshold, chronic-care model for treatment of OUD. RESULTS: The B-MAT clinic expanded county-wide access by 34% over seven months. A total of 23 patients were seen with 21 eligible for treatment with B-MAT. All nine patients with at least 90-day continuous treatment were retained in the program. Three quarters of patients had at least 30 days of active buprenorphine-naloxone coverage and 17% of all patients were lost to follow up. There were no induction-related adverse events, no fatalities, and one nonfatal overdose. In a chart review, 85% of patients met at least six of eight quality criteria. CONCLUSIONS: This low-barrier approach to OUD expanded access to treatment and demonstrated a model stable enough to continue delivering care throughout the first 5 months of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. NPs in primary care settings can effectively provide B-MAT in a low-threshold, office-based setting.","Carroll, Emily",J Am Assoc Nurse Pract (Online),,336

424665,"Depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation in nurses with and without symptoms of secondary traumatic stress during the COVID-19 outbreak",2021,"Exercise behavior is under partial genetic control, but it is also affected by numerous environmental factors, potentially including early-life experiences whose effects persist into adulthood. We studied genetic and early-life environmental effects on wheel-running behavior in a mouse model that includes four replicate high runner (HR) lines selectively bred for increased voluntary wheel running as young adults and four non-selected control (C) lines. In a full factorial design, mice from each line were granted wheel access or not and administered either standard or Western diet (WD) from weaning (3 weeks old) to 6 weeks of age (sexual maturity). In addition to acute effects, after a washout period of 8 weeks (â¼6 human years) in which all mice had standard diet and no wheel access, we found both beneficial and detrimental effects of these early-life exposures. During the first week of treatments, WD increased distance run by 29% in C mice and 48% in HR mice (significant Dietâ¯×â¯Linetype interaction), but diet effects disappeared by the third week. Across the three weeks of juvenile treatment, WD significantly increased fat mass (with lean mass as a covariate). Tested as adults, early-life exercise increased wheel running of C mice but not HR mice in the first week. Early-life exercise also reduced adult anxiety-like behavior and increased adult fasted blood glucose levels, triceps surae mass, subdermal fat pad mass, and brain mass, but decreased heart ventricle mass. Using fat mass as a covariate, early-life exercise treatment increased adult leptin concentration. In contrast, early-life WD increased adult wheel running of HR mice but not C mice. Early-life WD also increased adult lean mass and adult preference for Western diet in all groups. Surprisingly, early-life treatment had no significant effect on adult body fat or maximal aerobic capacity (VO2max). No previous study has tested for combined or interactive effects of early-life WD and exercise. Our results demonstrate that both factors can have long-lasting effects on adult voluntary exercise and related phenotypes, and that these effects are modulated by genetic background. Overall, the long-lasting effects of early-life exercise were more pervasive than those of WD, suggesting critical opportunities for health intervention in childhood habits, as well as possible threats from modern challenges. These results may be relevant for understanding potential effects of activity reductions and dietary changes associated with the obesity epidemic and COVID-19 pandemic.","Cadney, Marcell D; Hiramatsu, Layla; Thompson, Zoe; Zhao, Meng; Kay, Jarren C; Singleton, Jennifer M; Albuquerque, Ralph Lacerda de; Schmill, Margaret P; Saltzman, Wendy; Garland, Theodore",Physiol Behav,,336

In this study, we aimed to investigate the clinical and laboratory effects of covid 19 disease on children. The epidemiological, laboratory, radiological, and treatment features of the 30 pediatric patients with covid-19 evaluated retrospectively. The median age of the patients was 10 years, boys and girls ratio was 1.5 (18/12). Of the patients, 80.7% had family contact and 11.5% had comorbidity. The most common symptom was fever (84.6%), and cough was the second frequency (57.7%). All patients except 1 patient had a mild course, 5 were asymptomatic. One patient needed intensive care who had underlying chronic disease. Neutropenia was the most common laboratory anomaly (36.6%). Increased D-dimer levels were observed in 9 patients (30%), decreased leukocyte was in 7 patients (23.3%) and increasedlactate dehydrogenaz level was in 8 patients (26.6%). Chest computed tomography was taken 14 patients who had an abnormal chest X-rays, and ground-glass opacities were seen in 6 patients (20%). Hydroxychlorachine, azithromycin and other antibiotic treatments were given to the necessary patients. The mean PCR negative time in the treated symptomatic group was 8.8 +5.34 day, while in the untreated asymptomatic group 12 + 5.19 day and there was no statistically significant difference (p=0.154). The correlation between PCR negative time and clinical, laboratory, and radiological findings was examined and no correlation was found. In conclusion, pediatric covid 19 is mostly transmitted by family contact and has a mild course if there is no underlying disease. The most common symptoms are fever and cough. Ground glass densities on lung tomography are similar to adult. More conservative approaches may be preferred in children.","Ozkan, E. A.; Erdeniz, E.

424969,Eliminating Categorical Exclusion Criteria in Crisis Standards of Care Frameworks,2020,"Lockdowns imposed by governments worldwide as a way to limit the spread of severe atypical respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2) have had heavy psychological and economic consequences. Arthritis patients are a vulnerable population at an increased risk of peritraumatic stress. This could be due to several reasons, including the fear of shortage of medicine and difficulty receiving periodical medical checks. In the present case-control study, psychological distress in patients with autoimmune arthritis during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic were investigated. An electronic survey was conducted to gather information on the perceived change in the emotional state, general health (GH), fatigue, joint pain, and disease activity during the lockdown, in 100 patients with autoimmune arthritis and 100 controls. Mental health status was measured using the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). The COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI) was used to assess the frequency of peritraumatic stress disorders related to COVID-19. Patients reported a significant worsening of perceived GH (36% vs. 7%; p < 0.001), a significantly higher mean CPDI score (p < 0.001) than controls. Using multivariate analysis, arthritis patients had significantly higher CPDI scores (+3.67 points; p = 0.019), independent of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms, comorbidities, and sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics. Logistic regression analysis showed that the risk of reporting worsened GH was 9-fold higher in patients than controls (p < 0.001). Patients with autoimmune arthritis are at higher risk of psychological distress related to COVID-19 pandemic; thus targeted intervention should be designed to strengthen coping capacity in this vulnerable population.","Picchianti Diamanti, Andrea; Cattaruzza, Maria Sofia; Di Rosa, Roberta; Del Porto, Flavia; Salemi, Simonetta; Sorgi, Maria Laura; Martin Martin, Luis Severino; Rai, Alessandra; Iacono, Dalila; Sesti, Giorgio; Alessandri, Guido; Laganà, Bruno",,,336
426179,461 A review of cutaneous lymphoma outcomes during COVID-19 pandemic at Columbia University,2021,"OBJECTIVES: To report a case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reinfection 6 months after the first infection in a young healthy female physician. Both episodes led to mild coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 infections were detected by real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) on nasopharyngeal specimens. Reinfection was confirmed by whole-genome sequencing. Kinetics of total anti-S receptor binding domain immunoglobulins (Ig anti-S RBD), anti-nucleoprotein (anti-N) and neutralizing antibodies were determined in serial serum samples retrieved during both infection episodes. Memory B-cell responses were assessed at day 12 after reinfection. RESULTS: Whole-genome sequencing identified two different SARS-CoV-2 genomes both belonging to clade 20A, with only one nonsynonymous mutation in the spike protein and clustered with viruses circulating in Geneva (Switzerland) at the time of each of the corresponding episodes. Seroconversion was documented with low levels of total Ig anti-S RBD and anti-N antibodies at 1 month after the first infection, whereas neutralizing antibodies quickly declined after the first episode and then were boosted by the reinfection, with high titres detectable 4 days after symptom onset. A strong memory B-cell response was detected at day 12 after onset of symptoms during reinfection, indicating that the first episode elicited cellular memory responses. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid decline of neutralizing antibodies may put medical personnel at risk of reinfection, as shown in this case. However, reinfection leads to a significant boosting of previous immune responses. Larger cohorts of reinfected subjects with detailed descriptions of their immune responses are needed to define correlates of protection and their duration after infection.","Vetter, Pauline; Cordey, Samuel; Schibler, Manuel; Vieux, Laure; Despres, Lena; Laubscher, Florian; Andrey, Diego O; Martischang, Romain; Harbarth, Stephan; Cuvelier, Clémence; Bekliz, Meriem; Eckerle, Isabella; Siegrist, Claire-Anne; Didierlaurent, Arnaud M; Eberhardt, Christiane S; Meyer, Benjamin; Kaiser, Laurent",Clin. microbiol. infect,,336

Many UK patients are seen at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, Stanmore for more than a decade of specialist management. Prior to the recent COVID crisis, we recognised need for more frequent monitoring without the inconvenience of cross-country travel and so piloted an online system of monitoring CRMO. Method: An online assessment form was created using the GDPR-compliant Qualtrics system after consultation with CRMO paediatricians and a specialist nurse. 3 medical students telephoned parents of 31 patients to pilot the assessment form. Responses indicating issues were then referred to the CNS for follow-up. Results: Response data confirmed need for close monitoring with 26% of respondents being seen quarterly, 29% reporting pain greater than 6/ 10, 29% having side-effects and 30% finding current treatment ineffective. 74% of respondents found online assessment extremely/very useful and 58% preferred it to face-to-face appointments. Conclusions: A digital CRMO monitoring tool can successfully identify patients with both new and ongoing issues. In the COVID and post- COVID era, digital tools can closely monitor patients with chronic conditions like CRMO whilst improving quality of life by reducing need for face-to-face appointments.","Dave, D.; Choi, J.; Karamchandani, U.; Jacobs, B.",British Journal of Surgery,,336

430640,Accelerating Mixed Methods Research With Natural Language Processing of Big Text Data,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic draws into focus the need to rebuild resilient health systems with increased access to quality health services. Reaction ability to changing demand is crucial. Resilience is relevant because all countries have vulnerable communities. One could push the argument further, using as an example the resilience particularly present on the agenda of meetings of the World Health Organization. More critical than ever, it is to take stock of the lessons learned. The stakeholders need to work together to accelerate progress towards universal access to essential health information through resilience. Regarding major societal challenges, which have a local dimension, universities have a key role to play in the knowledge creation of innovative products and services. The need for timely, accurate, and reliable data about the Vale do Jequitinhonha in the health system is unarguably overdue for a real-time, technology-driven, surveillance and reporting infrastructure to respond effectively to public health emergencies. Health system resilience is one of the focuses in low-income region framework and it is an indispensable university strategy for managing the health risks of older adults, and chronic disease patients. COVID-19 can cause disruption in health systems. Disruptions to health service infrastructure can result in loss of life, negative economic impact, and harm to communities. Focused actions include investing in Primary Health Care (PHC) and this encompasses basic preventive, promotive, and curative health cares for enhancing the health status of the people by reducing morbidity and mortality rates.

431247,Generalized anxiety and depressive symptoms in various age groups during the COVID-19 lockdown in Poland. Specific predictors and differences in symptoms severity,2021,"During such unprecedented time as COVID-19, despite stretched to its limit, public service delivery remains crucial to societies' well-being. Street-level bureaucrats (SLBs), specifically, become the most visible outreach of public policies to citizen. However, as the literature suggests, unintended outcomes of SLBs-citizen interfacing have been discretion, inefficiency and accountability, an issue lies at the heart of the standard public governance. No scholarly attempt has been made in the past to address this shortcoming. This research by proposing a conceptual model using system dynamics captures the complexity, and in so doing posits testable hypotheses that instigate an alternative visualization of public affairs, thereby closing the gap in the SLB scholarship.","Prusty, Santosh Kumar; Mahapatra, Diptiranjan",J Public Aff,,336
431339,"A longitudinal study on clinically relevant self-reported depression, anxiety and acute stress features among Italian community-dwelling adults during the COVID-19 related lockdown: Evidence of a predictive role for baseline dysfunctional personality dimensions",2021,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Increased alcohol consumption has been proposed as a potential consequence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. There has been little scrutiny of alcohol use behaviors resulting in hospital visits, which is essential to guide pandemic public policy. We aimed to determine whether COVID-19 peak restrictions were associated with increased hospital visits for alcohol use or withdrawal. Secondary objectives were to describe differences based on age, sex and race, and to examine alcohol-related complication incidence. DESIGN: Multi-center, retrospective, pre-post study. SETTING: New York City health system with five participating hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Adult emergency department encounters for alcohol use, alcoholic gastritis or pancreatitis or hepatitis, alcohol withdrawal syndrome, withdrawal seizure or delirium tremens. MEASUREMENTS: Age, sex, race, site and encounter diagnosis. Encounters were compared between 2019 and 2020 for 1 March to 31 May. FINDINGS: There were 2790 alcohol-related visits during the 2019 study period and 1793 in 2020, with a decrease in total hospital visits. Of 4583 alcohol-related visits, median age was 47 years, with 22.3% females. In 2020 there was an increase in percentage of visits for alcohol withdrawal [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.07-1.67] and withdrawal with complications (aOR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.14-1.72), and a decline in percentage of hospital visits for alcohol use (aOR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.59-0.85) and use with complications (aOR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.58-0.88). It is unknown whether use visit changes mirror declines in other chief complaints. The age groups 18-29 and 60-69 years were associated with increased visits for use and decreased visits for withdrawal, as were non-white race groups. Sex was not associated with alcohol-related visit changes despite male predominance. CONCLUSIONS: In New York City during the initial COVID-19 peak (1 March to 31 May 2020), hospital visits for alcohol withdrawal increased while those for alcohol use decreased.","Schimmel, Jonathan; Vargas-Torres, Carmen; Genes, Nicholas; Probst, Marc A; Manini, Alex F",Addiction,,336

Due to difficulties in diagnosing this infection in populations around the world, initiatives supported by digital technologies are being developed by governments and private companies to enable the tracking of the public's symptoms, contacts and movements. Considering the current scenario, initiatives designed to support infection surveillance and monitoring are essential and necessary. Nonetheless, ethical, legal and technical questions abound regarding the amount and types of personal data being collected, processed, shared and used in the name of public health, as well as the concomitant or posterior use of this data. These challenges demonstrate the need for new models of responsible and transparent data and technology governance in efforts to control SARS-COV2, as well as in future public health emergencies.","Almeida, Bethania de Araujo; Doneda, Danilo; Ichihara, Maria Yury; Barral-Netto, Manoel; Matta, Gustavo Correa; Rabello, Elaine Teixeira; Gouveia, Fabio Castro; Barreto, Mauricio",Cien Saude Colet,,336

Conclusions There is a marked reduction in UDE case volume during the COVID-19 period. Self-medication by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs was higher during this period with a slight increase in the prevalence of ulcer disease withadvanced lesions and the use of an interventional endoscopic gesture during this period. In addition, there is a stability in the number of hemorrhagic decompensations of chronic liver disease and also in theprevalence of tumor pathology diagnosed on endoscopy during this period that can be related the silent evolution of thesepathologies.","Elmqaddem, O.; Nasiri, M.; Taiymi, A.; Zazour, A.; Elmekkaoui, A.; Khannoussi, W.; Kharrasse, G.; Ismaili, Z.",Endoscopy,,336
432205,The Toll of Feeling Older: Subjective Age Moderates the Associations between Anxiety Sensitivity and Symptoms of Anxiety and Depression during COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"CONTEXT: The COVID-19 pandemic has had an effect on many communities' physical and mental well-being, especially that of healthcare workers. During the pandemic, health workers have shown signs of depression and anxiety and have experienced sleep disturbances. Few studies have examined health workers' resilience during the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The current study intended to examine the job stress and mental well-being of nurses who have supported, worked with, and cared for COVID-19 patients in an intensive care unit. DESIGN: The research team performed a narrative review by searching the Mendeley, ScienceDirect, Medline, PubMed, Google Scholar, and Springer databases. The search used many keywords, both alone and in combination, such as COVID-19, pandemic, nurses, healthcare professionals, stress, and frontline workers. The review considered only English journals. SETTING: This study was take place in Second Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Province, China. RESULTS: During the current pandemic, COVID-19 prevention in social settings, governmental regulation during the pandemic, and provision of frontline care have faced notable challenges. In general, nurses who have assisted during the COVID-19 pandemic have been under severe strain. The key factors that influenced nurses' stress were being only children, their working time per week, and their levels of anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has posed a vast threat to public health worldwide. The psychological stress of nurses should be managed in public-health emergencies.","Lin, Q.; Zheng, Y.",Altern Ther Health Med,,336

432851,Psychological distress among people with probable COVID-19 infection: analysis of the UK Household Longitudinal Study,2021,"BackgroundVitamin D levels have been reported to be associated with COVID-19 susceptibility, severity and mortality events.. We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the use of vitamin D intervention on COVID-19 outcomes. MethodsLiterature search was conducted using PubMed, Cochrane library, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases (latest search on August 5, 2021). We included RCTs reporting the use of vitamin D intervention to control/placebo group in COVID-19. Two independent researchers did literature search, abstracted data, and the risk of bias assessment. ResultsA total of 6 RCTs with 551 COVID-19 patients were included. The overall collective evidence pooling all the outcomes across all RCTs indicated the beneficial use of vitamin D intervention in COVID-19 (relative risk, RR = 0.60, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.92, Z=2.33, p=0.02, I2 = 48%). However, no statistical significance was observed for individual outcomes of ICU care (RR = 0.11, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.30, Z=1.48, p=0.14, I2 = 66%) and mortality (RR = 0.78, 95% CI 0.25 to 2.40, Z=0.66, p=0.02, I2 = 33%), though decreased rates were noted. The rates of RT-CR positivity was significantly decreased in the intervention group as compared to the non-vitamin D groups (RR = 0.46, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.89, Z=2.31, p=0.02, I2 = 0%). ConclusionCOVID-19 patients supplemented with vitamin D are more likely to demonstrate fewer rates of ICU admission, mortality events and RT-PCR positivity. However, no statistical significance has been achieved for individual outcomes of ICU and deaths. More RCTs and completion of ongoing trials largely needed to precisely establish the association between vitamin D use and COVID-19.","Varikasuvu, Seshadri Reddy; Thangappazham, Balachandar; Raj, Hemanth",,,336

A cohort cross-sectional survey examined employees' perceptions of an ethics environment, racial-ethnic, and position disparities (HO1; ANOVA), and, secondarily, ethics in relationship to select, research-grounded work features measured as manage disagreements, effectiveness, work satisfaction, and opinions of care, the latter including intention to remain (HO2; Pearson Correlations). Established questionnaires with robust psychometrics were employed. Response rate was 51%. Non-significant differences between sample and population on key variables supported extrapolation of results. Statistically significant differences between racial-ethnic (p < 0.03; F 2.42) and work positions (p <0.0001; F 6.24) were revealed on ethics (3.16; HO1). Statistically significant relationships (p <0.0001; r = 0.26-0.68; HO2) between ethics and employees' work features also were found, confirming both hypotheses. Perceptions of ethics based on racial-ethnic and position disparities, as well as the robust links with employee work features, offered potential avenues for decreasing disparities at work and improving the quality of long-term care. Noted further on ethics item scoring were relatively low scores indicating less involvement in, and access to, ethics discussions and decisions. In contrast, the literature review substantiated the importance of empowerment and retention, which were enhanced by employee involvement in work, notably, discussions and decisions. Thus, implications of ethics committees in long-term care sites as ways to potentially enhance employees' work and quality of care, especially work satisfaction and retention, were explored; relevant concerns raised by the Covid pandemic were, briefly, discussed.","McDaniel, Charlotte; Veledar, Emir",HEC forum,,336

Of particular interest is the aftermath of superimposing viral epidemics (especially SARS-CoV-2) over long-standing diseases, such as tuberculosis (TB), which remains a significant disease for public health worldwide and especially in emerging economies. Methods and Results: The PubMed electronic database was systematically searched for relevant articles linking TB, influenza, and SARS-CoV viruses and subsequently assessed eligibility according to inclusion criteria. Using a data mining approach, we also queried the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19). We aimed to answer the following questions: What can be learned from other coronavirus outbreaks (focusing on TB patients)? Is coinfection (TB and SARS-CoV-2) more severe? Is there a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2? How does the TB vaccine affect COVID-19? How does one diagnosis affect the other? Discussions. Few essential elements about TB and SARS-CoV coinfections were discussed. First, lessons from past outbreaks (other coronaviruses) and influenza pandemic/seasonal outbreaks have taught the importance of infection control to avoid the severe impact on TB patients. Second, although challenging due to data scarcity, investigating the pathological pathways linking TB and SARS-CoV-2 leads to the idea that their coexistence might yield a more severe clinical evolution. Finally, we addressed the issues of vaccination and diagnostic reliability in the context of coinfection. Conclusions: Because viral respiratory infections and TB impede the host's immune responses, it can be assumed that their lethal synergism may contribute to more severe clinical evolution. Despite the rapidly growing number of cases, the data needed to predict the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with latent TB and TB sequelae still lies ahead. The trial is registered with NCT04327206, NCT01829490, and NCT04121494.","Crisan-Dabija, Radu; Grigorescu, Cristina; Pavel, Cristina-Alice; Artene, Bogdan; Popa, Iolanda Valentina; Cernomaz, Andrei; Burlacu, Alexandru",Can Respir J,,336

All the guidelines and medications available for treatment of COVID-19 were reviewed with selection of the less toxic medications that could be used in advanced liver disease. Drugs suitable to manage COVID-19 in patients with liver disease might include remdesivir intravenously, nitazoxanide + sofosbuvir, ivermectin, tocilizumab, convalescent plasma, and low molecular weight heparin in certain situations. Advanced liver disease is associated with portal hypertension and splenomegaly with reduction of blood elements and immune dysfunction and impaired T cell function.

The market for these devices has since expanded considerably. This evaluation of IRT performance may have significant implications for febrility screening worldwide. AIM: Perform controlled nonhuman trials of IRT devices to identify and quantify deviations in the human temperature range. APPROACH: We compared IRT readings of a temperature-controlled non-human subject with one FDA-cleared IRT and one FDA-cleared handheld NCIT. In individual trials for each device, the subject was measured between 35°C and 40°C at 0.25°C increments. RESULTS: The IRT device measurements were consistently normalized around the human mean (â¼37 ° C). Temperatures were decremented as they approached the febrile range, and systematically reported as normal across all seven devices. This effect does not appear to be explained by a fixed offset or any known approach to estimating body temperature, or by random error. CONCLUSION: The IRTs in this study generated human temperature measurements that were systematically biased to the mean human temperature. Given that these devices are utilized for sentinel detection of possible infectious disease transmission, and are now globally employed, the implications for reduced detection of febrility are a widespread false sense of security. This vulnerability must be considered with respect to facility access control, clinical applications, and travel screening in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic response.","Healy, Conor; Segal, Zachary; Hinnerichs, Chris; Ace, Ethan; Ward, Derek; Honovich, John",J. biomed. opt.

It could be hypothesized that immunodeficient patients, due to immunosuppressive drugs or their disease, have a more severe disease course due to their immunocompromised state. However, it could also be hypothesized that some of the immunosuppressive drugs protect against a hyperinflammatory state. Methods: We collected data on the incidence of COVID-19, disease course and SARS-CoV-2 antibody formation in COVID-19 positive patients in a cohort of patients (n= 4497) known at the Clinical Immunology outpatient clinic in a tertiary care hospital in the Netherlands. Results: In the first six months of the pandemic, 16 patients were identified with COVID-19, 14 by nasal swab PCR, and 2 patients by SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Eight patients were admitted to the hospital. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were measured in 8 patients and were detectable in all, including one patient on B-cell ablative therapy and one patient with Common Variable Immunodeficiency Disorder. Conclusion: This study indicates that the disease course differs among immunocompromised patients, independently of (dis)continuation of immunosuppressive drugs. Antibody production for SARS-CoV-2 in immunocompromised patients was shown. More research needs to be conducted to confirm these observations and guidelines regarding (dis)continuation of immunosuppressive drugs in COVID-19 positive immunocompromised patients should be developed.","Guchelaar, N A D; van Laar, J A M; Hermans, M A W; van der Houwen, T B; Atmaca, S; van Maaren, M S; Brkic, Z; van Daele, P L A; Dalm, V A S H; van Hagen, P M; Rombach, S M",J Transl Autoimmun,,336

O experimento foi conduzido em duas fases. No experimento 1, foram utilizados 130 hamsters fêmeas divididos em 12 grupos de acordo com a concentração do inóculo infectante (30 e 100 leptospiras/campo), a freqüência de exposição (uma, duas e quatro exposições) e a via de inoculação (pele escarificada e pele íntegra). No experimento 2, foram formados dois grupos de 10 animais, separados em caixas de polipropileno: animais sadios com escarificação cutânea (G1); e animais sadios com pele íntegra (G2). Nas caixas de ambos os grupos foi introduzido um hamster previamente infectado com Leptospira interrogans sorovar Canicola, estirpe LO4, por escarificação cutânea na dose de 100 leptospiras/campo. As condições de umidade foram mantidas por borrifações diárias (duas vezes ao dia) com água, por um período de 21 dias. Em ambas as fases, os animais foram observados duas vezes ao dia, durante 21 dias. Os animais que vieram a óbito foram necropsiados e colhidos assepticamente rins, fígado, sistema genital (útero e ovário) e cérebro. Os animais sobreviventes foram eutanasiados após 21 dias. Foram ainda colhidas amostras de soro sanguíneo por punção cardíaca para a pesquisa de aglutininas antileptospiras nos animais sobreviventes. Para a detecção de leptospiras, foram utilizados microscopia direta a fresco, cultivo microbiológico e coloração pelo método de Whartin-Starry. Para a observação das alterações patológicas dos órgãos foi utilizada a coloração por Hematoxilina-Eosina. O teste de soroaglutinação microscópica (SAM) foi utilizado para a detecção de aglutininas antileptospiras. As técnicas de microscopia direta e o cultivo microbiológico foram eficientes na identificação de leptospiras nos órgãos de hamsters inoculados com o sorovar Canicola, estirpe LO4. A via cutânea escarificada induziu maior letalidade quando comparada com a pele integra nas duas concentrações do inóculo infectante, com estabelecimento e evolução da leptospirose com lesões típicas da doença; por outro lado, a via cutânea íntegra induziu mais freqüentemente o estado de portador renal e/ou genital para leptospirose. A freqüência de exposição e a concentração do inóculo infectante não influenciaram no estado de portador renal e/ou genital ou mesmo na presença de leptospiras no tecido cerebral nas duas condições cutâneas empregadas na infecção experimental. A estirpe LO4 apresentou baixo poder imunogênico, não apresentando soroconversão na SAM, em ambas as condições de inoculação cutânea.

(Special Section: Eating disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic.),2020,"Purpose: The aim of this work was to study and document retinal changes in coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) positive patients with nonsevere disease using a nonmydriatic handheld fundus camera. Methods: A cross-sectional observational study was conducted on patients affected by COVID-19 who were admitted at our center. Our study included patients with no, mild, and moderate symptoms (nonsevere cases). Intensive care unit (ICU)-admitted patients were excluded considering the difficulty in procuring the fundus image by the handheld camera due to patients positioning. Patients with systemic conditions (diabetes, hypertension, and severe anemia) known to cause retinopathy were also excluded. Bedside anterior segment examination, fundus examination using indirect ophthalmoscopy and fundus imaging of each patient using a nonmydriatic handheld fundus camera was done by a trained ophthalmologist posted for COVID duty. Results: In a cohort of 138 patients, 94 (68.1%) were men and 44 (31.9%) were women. A total of 276 eyes were evaluated. The mean age of the patients was 38.51 ± 14.4 years. Anterior segment evaluation showed no abnormality in any of the eyes. On fundus screening using nonmydriatic handheld camera, a single streak of superficial retinal hemorrhage was noted at the posterior pole of the fundus in the left eye of one patient (0.72%), which was away from fovea. Laboratory tests revealed low hemoglobin (between 10 and 10.9 g/dL falling under mild Anemia) in 12 patients, elevated total leucocyte count in 6 patients, raised LDH in majority of patients (323 ± 101 Units/L) and elevated CRP (14.6 ± 30.99 mg/L). Rest of the lab parameters were within the normal range. Conclusion: In our study, COVID patients with mild-to-moderate symptoms did not show any inflammatory/infective or vaso-occlusive lesions in the retina attributable to COVID-19 infection, except one patient who had a single streak hemorrhage in the macula away from fovea, probably incidental.","Bypareddy, Ravi; Rathod, B L Sujatha; Shilpa, Y D; Hithashree, H R; Nagaraj, Kalpana Badami; Hemalatha, B C; Basumatary, Jessica; Bekal, Deeksha; Niranjan, R; Anusha, P G",Indian J Ophthalmol,,336

To address this, we developed an in-vitro infection model for two human coronaviruses; alphacoronavirus 229E-CoV (229E) and betacoronavirus OC43-CoV (OC43) in differentiated primary human bronchial epithelial cells (pBECs). Primary BECs from healthy subjects were grown at air liquid interface (ALI) and infected with 229E or OC43, and replication kinetics and time-course expression of innate immune mediators were assessed. OC43 and 229E-CoVs replicated in differentiated pBECs but displayed distinct replication kinetics: 229E replicated rapidly with viral load peaking at 24 hours post-infection, whilst OC43 replication was slower peaking at 7 days after infection. This was associated with diverse anti-viral response profiles defined by increased expression of type I/III interferons and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) by 229E compared to OC43. Understanding the host-virus interaction for previously established coronaviruses will give insight into pathogenic mechanisms underpinning SARS-CoV-2-induced respiratory disease and other future coronaviruses that may arise from zoonotic sources.","Loo, Su-Ling; Wark, Peter A B; Esneau, Camille; Nichol, Kristy S; Hsu, Alan C-Y; Bartlett, Nathan W",,,336
443079,[Risk Communication and Community Engagement in the COVID-19 Pandemic in Portugal]./ A Comunicação do Risco e Envolvimento da Comunidade na Pandemia de COVID-19 em Portugal,2020,"BACKGROUND: Mutations of thyroid hormone receptor alpha 1 (TRalpha1) cause resistance to thyroid hormone (RTHalpha). Patients exhibit growth retardation, delayed bone development, anemia, and bradycardia. By using mouse models of RTHalpha much has been learned about the molecular actions of TRalpha 1 mutants that underlie these abnormalities in adults. Using zebrafish models of RTHalpha that we have recently created, we aimed to understand how TRalpha1 mutants affect the heart function during this period. METHODS: In contrast to human and mice, the thra gene is duplicated, thraa and thrab, in zebrafish. Using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated targeted mutagenesis, we created C-terminal mutations in the each of two duplicated thra genes in zebrafish (thraa 8-bp insertion or thrab 1-bp insertion mutations). We recently showed that these mutant fish faithfully recapitulated growth retardation as found in patients and thra mutant mice. In the present studies, we used histological analysis, gene expression profiles, confocal fluorescence and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to comprehensively analyze the phenotypic characteristics of mutant fish heart during development. RESULTS: We found both a dilated atrium and an abnormally shaped ventricle in adult mutant fish. The retention of red blood cells in the two abnormal heart chambers, and decreased circulating blood speed and reduced expression of contractile genes indicated the weakened contractility in the heart of mutant fish. These abnormalities were detected in mutant fish as early as 35 days post fertilization (juveniles). Further, the expression of genes associated with the sarcomere assembly was suppressed in the heart of mutant fish, resulting in abnormalities of sarcomere organization as revealed by TEM. The abnormal sarcomere organization could underlie the bradycardia exhibited in mutant fish. CONCLUSIONS: Using a zebrafish model of RTHalpha, the present studies demonstrated for the first time that TRalpha mutants could act to cause abnormal heart structure, weaken contractility and disrupt sarcomere organization that affect heart functions. These findings provide new insights into the bradycardia found in RTHalpha patients.","Han, Cho Rong; Wang, Hui; Hoffmann, Victoria; Zerfas, Patricia; Kruhlak, Michael; Cheng, Sheue-Yann",Thyroid,,336

A longitudinal online survey was conducted in the State of Mexico, from 8 April to 27 May, 2020, in a sample of men and women between 18 and 60 years old, using: Impact of Event Scale-6, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, General Anxiety Disoder-7, and a questionnaire of concerns and behaviors related to COVID-19. Six hundred seventy participants were analyzed. Only a mild difference in distress was observed between the two waves and mild correlations of this variable with contagion in oneself and in a relative. Having a high-risk medical condition proved a considerable effect on distress within both waves. Perception of usefulness of preventive measures, concerns of contagion in a relative, and financial and security situations scored high within our questionnaire but did not change in the follow-up. We hypothesize that habituation to distressful events in the Mexican population (emergent resilience) might explain the absence of meaningful differences. Our research adds to the monitoring of mental health in Mexicans during the COVID-19 pandemic;its findings can serve to perform comparisons in other studies and for further meta-analyses.","Toledo-Fernández, Aldebarán Betancourt-Ocampo Diana González-González Alejandro",Behavioral Sciences,,336
443633,Alcohol-related self-harm due to COVID-19 pandemic: Might be an emerging crisis in the near future: A case report,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 has infected millions of individuals across the globe and has killed over 2.7 million people. Even though vaccines against this virus have recently been introduced, the antibody generated in the process has been reported to decline quickly. This can reduce the efficacy of vaccines over time and can result in re-infections. Thus, drugs that are effective against COVID-19 can provide a second line of defence and can prevent occurrence of the severe form of the disease. The interaction between SARS-CoV2 S-protein and human ACE2 (hACE2) is essential for the infection of the virus. Thus, drugs that block this interaction could potentially inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection into the host cells. To identify such drugs, we first analyzed the recently published crystal structure of S-protein-hACE2 complex and identified essential residues of both S-protein and hACE2 for this interaction. We used this knowledge to virtually dock a drug library containing 4115 drug molecules against S-protein for repurposing drugs that could inhibit binding of S-protein to hACE2. We identified several potential inhibitors based on their docking scores, pharmacological effects and ability to block residues of S protein required for interaction with hACE2. The top inhibitors included drugs used for the treatment of hepatitis C (velpatasvir, pibrentasvir) as well as several vitamin D derivatives. Several molecules obtained from our screen already have good experimental support in published literature. Thus, we believe that our results will facilitate the discovery of an effective drug against COVID-19. Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.","Singh, Adarsh; Dhar, Riddhiman",J Biomol Struct Dyn,,336

447679,Amabié-A Japanese Symbol of the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"COVID-19 is exposing a nexus between communities disproportionately suffering from underlying health conditions, policy-reinforced disparities, and susceptibility to the disease. As the virus spreads, policy responses will need to shift from focusing on surveillance and mitigation to recovery and prevention. Local governments, with their histories of mutual aid and familiarity with local communities, are capable of meeting these challenges. However, funding must flow in a flexible enough fashion for local governments to tailor their efforts to preserve vital services and rebuild local economies. We argue in this article that the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant (EECBG) programs are mechanisms for how to provide funds in a manner adaptable to local context while also focusing on increasing social equity. Administrators must emphasize the fourth pillar of public administration -- social equity -- in framing government responses to the pandemic.","Deslatte, Aaron; Hatch, Megan E; Stokan, Eric",PAR.

The method is based on a novel class of features, extracted from pulmonary sounds, by parameterizing their spectrograms that are represented as surfaces, and by utilizing geometrical distortions defined with reference to these surfaces. This method yields a set of highly descriptive features for the analysis of pulmonary sound recordings. Furthermore, by combining these features with Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, we introduce a powerful model for the automatic diagnosis of common respiratory pathologies. Compared with baseline methods, our model achieves superior results for binary and multi-class classifications of common respiratory diseases. Our new approach to the classification of one-dimensional signals is applicable to other signals in the context of their representations in combined spaces or manifolds.","Levy, Jeremy; Naitsat, Alexander; Zeevi, Yehoshua Y.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.02429v1.pdf,336

447939,The Issues of Transference and Countertransference in Online/Cyber Counseling during COVID-19 Outbreak,2020,"BACKGROUND: Tobacco and alcohol use are major behavioural risks in developing countries like Nepal, which are contributing to a rapid increase in non-communicable diseases (NCDs). This causal relationship is further complicated by the multi-level social determinants such as socio-political context, socio-economic factors and health systems. The systems approach has potential to facilitate understanding of such complex causal mechanisms. The objective of this paper is to describe the role of tobacco and alcohol use in the interaction of social determinants of NCDs in Nepal. METHOD: The study adopted a qualitative study design guided by the Systemic Intervention methodology. The study involved key informant interviews (n = 63) and focus group discussions (n = 12) at different levels (national, district and/or community) and was informed by the adapted Social Determinants of Health Framework. The data analysis involved case study-based thematic analysis using framework approach and development of causal loop diagrams. The study also involved three sense-making sessions with key stakeholders. RESULTS: Three key themes and causal loop diagrams emerged from the data analysis. Widespread availability of tobacco and alcohol products contributed to the use and addiction of tobacco and alcohol. Low focus on primary prevention by health systems and political influence of tobacco and alcohol industries were the major contributors to the problem. Gender and socio-economic status of families/communities were identified as key social determinants of tobacco and alcohol use. CONCLUSION: Tobacco and alcohol use facilitated interaction of the social determinants of NCDs in the context of Nepal. Socio-economic status of families was both driver and outcome of tobacco and alcohol use. Health system actions to prevent NCDs were delayed mainly due to lack of system insights and commercial influence. A multi-sectoral response led by the health system is urgently needed.","Sharma, Sudesh Raj; Matheson, Anna; Lambrick, Danielle; Faulkner, James; Lounsbury, David W; Vaidya, Abhinav; Page, Rachel",BMC Public Health,,336

Objective: To estimate the association of age with the likelihood of developing symptoms and the association of age with the likelihood of progressing to critical illness after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study analyzed quarantined case contacts, identified between February 20 and April 16, 2020, in the Lombardy region of Italy. Contacts were monitored daily for symptoms and tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection, by either real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction using nasopharyngeal swabs or retrospectively via IgG serological assays. Close contacts of individuals with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were selected as those belonging to clusters (ie, groups of contacts associated with an index case) where all individuals were followed up for symptoms and tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Data were analyzed from February to June 2020. Exposure: Close contact with individuals with confirmed COVID-19 cases as identified by contact tracing operations. Main Outcomes and Measures: Age-specific estimates of the risk of developing respiratory symptoms or fever greater than or equal to 37.5 °C and of experiencing critical disease (defined as requiring intensive care or resulting in death) in SARS-CoV-2-infected case contacts. Results: In total, 5484 case contacts (median [interquartile range] age, 50 [30-61] years; 3086 female contacts [56.3%]) were analyzed, 2824 of whom (51.5%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (median [interquartile range] age, 53 [34-64] years; 1604 female contacts [56.8%]). The proportion of infected persons who developed symptoms ranged from 18.1% (95% CI, 13.9%-22.9%) among participants younger than 20 years to 64.6% (95% CI, 56.6%-72.0%) for those aged 80 years or older. Most infected contacts (1948 of 2824 individuals [69.0%]) did not develop respiratory symptoms or fever greater than or equal to 37.5 °C. Only 26.1% (95% CI, 24.1%-28.2%) of infected individuals younger than 60 years developed respiratory symptoms or fever greater than or equal to 37.5 °C; among infected participants older than 60 years, 6.6% (95% CI, 5.1%-8.3%) developed critical disease. Female patients were 52.7% (95% CI, 24.4%-70.7%) less likely than male patients to develop critical disease after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusions and Relevance: In this Italian cohort study of close contacts of patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, more than one-half of individuals tested positive for the virus. However, most infected individuals did not develop respiratory symptoms or fever. The low proportion of children and young adults who developed symptoms highlights the possible challenges in readily identifying SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Poletti, Piero; Tirani, Marcello; Cereda, Danilo; Trentini, Filippo; Guzzetta, Giorgio; Sabatino, Giuliana; Marziano, Valentina; Castrofino, Ambra; Grosso, Francesca; Del Castillo, Gabriele; Piccarreta, Raffaella; Andreassi, Aida; Melegaro, Alessia; Gramegna, Maria; Ajelli, Marco; Merler, Stefano",JAMA Netw Open,,336

Objective: Determine whether mandatory daily employee symptom attestation data can be used as syndromic surveillance to forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations in the communities where employees live. Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: Large academic hospital network of 10 hospitals accounting for a total of 2,384 beds and 136,000 discharges in New England. Participants: 6,841 employees working on-site of Hospital 1 from April 2, 2020 to November 4, 2020, who live in the 10 hospitals' service areas. Interventions: Mandatory, daily employee self-reported symptoms were collected using an automated text messaging system. Main Outcomes: Mean absolute error (MAE) and weighted mean absolute percentage error (WMAPE) of 7 day forecasts of daily COVID-19 hospital census at each hospital. Results: 6,841 employees, with a mean age of 40.8 (SD = 13.6), 8.8 years of service (SD = 10.4), and 74.8% were female (n = 5,120), living in the 10 hospitals' service areas. Our model has an MAE of 6.9 COVID-19 patients and a WMAPE of 1.5% for hospitalizations for the entire hospital network. The individual hospitals had an MAE that ranged from 0.9 to 4.5 patients (WMAPE ranged from 2.1% to 16.1%). At Hospital 1, a doubling of the number of employees reporting symptoms (which corresponds to 4 additional employees reporting symptoms at the mean for Hospital 1) is associated with a 5% increase in COVID-19 hospitalizations at Hospital 1 in 7 days (95% CI: (0.02, 0.07)). Conclusions: We found that a real-time employee health attestation tool used at a single hospital could be used to predict subsequent hospitalizations in 7 days at hospitals throughout a larger hospital network in New England.","Horng, Steven; O'Donoghue, Ashley; Dechen, Tenzin; Rabesa, Matthew; Shammout, Ayad; Markson, Lawrence; Jegadeesan, Venkat; Tandon, Manu; Stevens, Jennifer P.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.07742v1.pdf,336

Our health system began shutting down entire hospital for two weeks after a transport agent was diagnosed with COVID-19. It took an additional two weeks to establish the process of emergency treatment. We intend to introduce our protocols and report on their progress so far.Post-COVID-19 Protocol (Figure 1) Methods: A total of 52 patients underwent mechanical thrombectomy at Eunpyeong St. Mary's Hospital before the Covid-19 outbreak. For 18 patients who underwent mechanical thrombectomy through a new process after COVID-19, door-to-image time, door-to-puncture time, and TICI grade were compared. Results: For the treatment of all patients, portable chest x-ray imaging was performed, but the doorto- initial-brain-image time (min) was 15.5 vs. 15 (before COVID-19 vs. after COVID-19) (p=0.265). Door-to-needle-time (min) showed a delay of 9 minutes, from 144.5 to 153.5, but it was not statistically significant (p=0.299). Up to 95.2% of patients before COVID-19 achieved TICI grade 2b or higher, and 100% of patients after COVID-19 have achieved TICI grade 2b or 3. (Table 1) Conclusions: Overall, there was a slight increase in the door-to-needle time, but clear protocols and guidelines for management and collaboration with the clinical workforce have been able to reduce delays and ensure timely and adequate management. When referring to the protocol implemented while preparing for infectious diseases, it will be a reference not only for COVID-19, but also for other diseases that may occur in the future.

458724,Analyzing the Effects of the Government Interventions Against the Second Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic in China (preprint),2021,"In December 2020, two COVID-19 vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) were authorized for emergency use in the United States for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).* Because of limited initial vaccine supply, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) prioritized vaccination of health care personnel and residents and staff members of long-term care facilities (LTCF) during the first phase of the U.S. COVID-19 vaccination program (1). Both vaccines require 2 doses to complete the series. Data on vaccines administered during December 14, 2020-January 14, 2021, and reported to CDC by January 26, 2021, were analyzed to describe demographic characteristics, including sex, age, and race/ethnicity, of persons who received &#8805;1 dose of COVID-19 vaccine (i.e., initiated vaccination). During this period, 12,928,749 persons in the United States in 64 jurisdictions and five federal entities§ initiated COVID-19 vaccination. Data on sex were reported for 97.0%, age for 99.9%, and race/ethnicity for 51.9% of vaccine recipients. Among persons who received the first vaccine dose and had reported demographic data, 63.0% were women, 55.0% were aged &#8805;50 years, and 60.4% were non-Hispanic White (White). More complete reporting of race and ethnicity data at the provider and jurisdictional levels is critical to ensure rapid detection of and response to potential disparities in COVID-19 vaccination. As the U.S. COVID-19 vaccination program expands, public health officials should ensure that vaccine is administered efficiently and equitably within each successive vaccination priority category, especially among those at highest risk for infection and severe adverse health outcomes, many of whom are non-Hispanic Black (Black), non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN), and Hispanic persons (2,3).","Painter, Elizabeth M; Ussery, Emily N; Patel, Anita; Hughes, Michelle M; Zell, Elizabeth R; Moulia, Danielle L; Scharf, Lynn Gibbs; Lynch, Michael; Ritchey, Matthew D; Toblin, Robin L; Murthy, Bhavini Patel; Harris, LaTreace Q; Wasley, Annemarie; Rose, Dale A; Cohn, Amanda; Messonnier, Nancy E",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,336

The aim of the present study was to assess the impact of restrictive measures in the Apulia Region, southern Italy, on air quality from March to April 2020. We applied a dual-track approach. We assessed citizen mobility and vehicle traffic with mobility network data and information obtained from satellite tracking, and we evaluated and compared pollutant concentration data as measured by monitoring stations maintained by the Regional Agency for Environmental Protection and Prevention of Apulia (ARPA). The results showed a decrease in the weekly mean NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration recorded by urban traffic stations during the lockdown period. In particular, in the city of Bari, the average NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration decreased from 62.2 mug/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; in March 2019 to 48.2 mug/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; in March 2020.

In this context, advanced artificial intelligence techniques are brought to the forefront as a response to the ongoing fight toward reducing the impact of this global health crisis. In this study, potential use-cases of intelligent speech analysis for COVID-19 identification are being developed. By analyzing speech recordings from COVID-19 positive and negative patients, we constructed audio- and symptomatic-based models to automatically categorize the health state of patients, whether they are COVID-19 positive or not. For this purpose, many acoustic features were established, and various machine learning algorithms are being utilized. Experiments show that an average accuracy of 80% was obtained estimating COVID-19 positive or negative, derived from multiple cough and vowel /a/ recordings, and an average accuracy of 83% was obtained estimating COVID-19 positive or negative patients by evaluating six symptomatic questions. We hope that this study can foster an extremely fast, low-cost, and convenient way to automatically detect the COVID-19 disease.","Shimon, Carmi; Shafat, Gabi; Dangoor, Inbal; Ben-Shitrit, Asher",J Acoust Soc Am,,336

This study represents the first assessment of rates of anxiety and depression in the general population of Ireland during the pandemic. AIMS: Our first aim was to estimate the probable prevalence rates of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and depression and to identify sociodemographic risk factors associated with screening positive for GAD or depression. Our second aim was to determine if COVID-19 related anxiety was highest amongst those in society at greatest risk of morality from COVID-19. METHOD: Self-report data were collected from a nationally representative Irish sample (N = 1041) online between March 31 and April 5; the first week of the nationwide quarantine measures. Recognized cut-off scores on the GAD-7 and PHQ-9 were used to estimate rates of GAD and depression. Correlates of screening positive for GAD or depression were assessed using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: GAD (20.0%), depression (22.8%) and GAD or depression (27.7%) was common. Screening positive for GAD or depression was associated with younger age, female sex, loss of income due to COVID-19, COVID-19 infection and higher perceived risk of COVID-19 infection. Citizens aged 65 and older had significantly higher levels of COVID-19 related anxiety than adults aged 18-34. CONCLUSIONS: Initial results from this multi-wave study monitoring changes in population anxiety and depression throughout the pandemic indicate that GAD and depression were common experiences in the population during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Hyland, P; Shevlin, M; McBride, O; Murphy, J; Karatzias, T; Bentall, R P; Martinez, A; Vallières, F",Acta psychiatr. scand,,336
460169,Psychological Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Emergency Dental Care Providers on the Frontlines in China,2020,"Histopathology of lipid-rich tissues is often a difficult endeavor, owing to the limited tissue processing workflows that can appropriately preserve tissue while keeping fatty deposits intact. Here, we present the first usage of near-infrared (NIR) photoacoustic remote sensing (PARS) to achieve imaging contrast from lipids without the need for exogenous stains or labels. In our system, the facile production of 1225 nm excitation pulses is achieved by the stimulated Raman scattering of a 1064 nm source propagating through an optical fiber. PARS-based detection is achieved by monitoring the change in the scattering profile of a co-aligned 1550 nm continuous-wave interrogation beam in response to absorption of the 1225 nm light by lipids. Our non-contact, reflection-mode approach can achieve a FWHM resolution of up to 0.96 µm and signal-to-noise ratios as high as 45 dB from carbon fibers and 9.7 dB from a lipid phantom. NIR-PARS offers a promising approach to image lipid-rich samples with a simplified workflow.","Kedarisetti, Pradyumna; Haven, Nathaniel J M; Restall, Brendon S; Martell, Matthew T; Zemp, Roger J",Opt Lett,,336

Cell-based approaches, primarily using mesenchymal stem (stromal) cells (MSCs), have demonstrated safety and possible efficacy in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), although they are not yet well studied in respiratory virus-induced ARDS. Limited pre-clinical data suggest that systemic MSC administration can significantly reduce respiratory virus (influenza strains H5N1 and H9N2)-induced lung injury; however, there are no available data in models of coronavirus respiratory infection.There is a rapidly increasing number of clinical investigations of cell-based therapy approaches for COVID-19. These utilise a range of different cell sources, doses, dosing strategies and targeted patient populations. To provide a rational strategy to maximise potential therapeutic use, it is critically important to understand the relevant pre-clinical studies and postulated mechanisms of MSC actions in respiratory virus-induced lung injuries.

METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of 7742 family medicine encounters at a single USA institution in the initial month of the COVID-19 public health emergency (PHE). We compared the demographics of those using telehealth during the PHE to those with face-to-face visits during the same time period; we also compared the demographics of those using full audio-video to those using audio-only. RESULTS: The likelihood of any telehealth visit in the first 30 days of telehealth expansion was higher for women, those age 65 years and older, self-pay patients, and those with Medicaid and Medicare as primary payers. The likelihood of a telehealth visit was reduced for rural residence and Black or other races. Among all telehealth visits, the likelihood of a full audio-video telehealth visit was reduced for patients who were older, Black, from urban areas, or who were self-pay, Medicaid, or Medicare payer status.

In 2012, the World Health Organisation (WHO) estimated that global deaths due to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) as about 38 million (68%). Most of these conditions are preventable through public health initiatives involving community pharmacists. This study aims to explore strategies enhancing the public health role of community pharmacists. Methods: Data was collected through telephone interviews, supported by Skype (audio), and recorded using the 'HD Call Recorder for Skype'. The qualitative data software package NVivo (version 10) was used for the storage, retrieval and analysis of data. The constant comparative method of data analysis was used. In addition, the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) was used to underpin the research throughout. Results: This study identified a number of strategies that could enhance the public health role of community pharmacists, some of which include: integrating undergraduate healthcare programmes;broadening the public health knowledge of students and pharmacists;pharmacists working alongside other healthcare professionals;teaching communication methods to students and pharmacists;teaching the use of new technologies and social media;etc. In addition, most of the 14 domains of TDF and several of their constructs were captured in the interview. Conclusions: To enhance the public health role of community pharmacists, it is necessary to develop pharmacists' capacity in several areas, particularly as it relates to, the use new technologies and social media in public health;enhancing training of pharmacists/students in public health;empowering pharmacists in public health;as well as teaching communication methods to students and pharmacists. Part of the strategy will also be, to integrate healthcare programmes through interdisciplinary initiatives, and changing the undergraduate pharmacy curriculum to increase its public health content.","Agomo, C.

Because the potential cardiac complications of COVID-19 were unknown at the time of her presentation, we chose to avoid the potential risks of haemodynamic collapse associated with afterload reduction from adenosine. Instead, a transoesophageal pacing catheter was placed. Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with an aberrated QRS morphology was diagnosed and the catheter was used to pace-terminate tachycardia. This presentation illustrates that the haemodynamic consequences of a concurrent infection with largely unknown neonatal sequelae present a potentially high-risk situation for pharmacologic conversion.

In the regime of large mixing, we show that this leads to striking changes of the field dynamics, delaying the onset of classical oscillations and decreasing, or even eliminating, the friction due to Hubble expansion. We highlight this phenomenon with a few examples. In the first example, we show how an axionlike particle can have its number abundance parametrically enhanced. In the second example, we demonstrate that the QCD axion can have its number abundance enhanced allowing for misalignment driven axion dark matter all the way down to f_{a} of order astrophysical bounds. In the third example, we show that the delayed oscillation of the scalar field can also sustain a period of inflation. In the last example, we present a situation where an oscillating scalar field is completely frictionless and does not dilute away in time.","Hook, Anson; Marques-Tavares, Gustavo; Tsai, Yuhsin",Phys Rev Lett,,336
463117,Dying in lockdown,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiologic agent for the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, has caused a public health emergency. The need for additional research in viral pathogenesis is essential as the number of cases and deaths rise. Understanding the virus and its ability to cause disease has been the main focus of current literature; however, there is much unknown. Studies have revealed new findings related to the full transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 and its subsequent ability to cause infection by different means. The virus is hypothesized to be of increased virulence compared with previous coronavirus that caused epidemics, in part due to its overall structural integrity and resilience to inactivation. To date, many studies have discussed that the rationale behind its transmission potential is that viral RNA has unexpectedly been detected in multiple bodily fluids, with some samples having remained positive for extended periods of time. Additionally, the receptor by which the virus gains cellular entry, ACE2, has been found to be expressed in different human body systems, thereby potentiating its infection in those locations. In this evidence-based comprehensive review, we discuss various potential routes of transmission of SARS-CoV-2-respiratory/droplet, indirect, fecal-oral, vertical, sexual, and ocular. Understanding these different routes is important as they pertain to clinical practice, especially in taking preventative measures to mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2.","Patel, Kishan P; Vunnam, Srinivas R; Patel, Puja A; Krill, Kaleigh L; Korbitz, Parker M; Gallagher, John P; Suh, Jane E; Vunnam, Rama R",Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,,336

Methods: Retrospective analysis on data from 32 consecutive patients with COVID-19, admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU) from March to May 2020. Outcomes considered were MDR infection and ICU mortality. Results: Fifty percent of patients developed an MDR infection during ICU stay after a median time of 8 [4-11] days. Most common MDR pathogens were carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii, causing bloodstream infections and pneumonia. MDR infections were linked to a higher length of ICU stay (p = 0.002), steroid therapy (p = 0.011), and associated with a lower ICU mortality (odds ratio: 0.439, 95% confidence interval: 0.251-0.763; p < 0.001). Low-dose aspirin intake was associated with both MDR infection (p = 0.043) and survival (p = 0.015). Among MDR patients, mortality was related with piperacillin-tazobactam use (p = 0.035) and an earlier onset of MDR infection (p = 0.042). Conclusions: MDR infections were a common complication in critically ill COVID-19 patients at our center. MDR risk was higher among those dwelling longer in the ICU and receiving steroids. However, MDR infections were not associated with a worse outcome.","Karruli, Arta; Boccia, Filomena; Gagliardi, Massimo; Patauner, Fabian; Ursi, Maria Paola; Sommese, Pino; De Rosa, Rosanna; Murino, Patrizia; Ruocco, Giuseppe; Corcione, Antonio; Andini, Roberto; Zampino, Rosa; Durante-Mangoni, Emanuele",Microb. drug resist.

466749,Spatial analysis of global variability in covid-19 burden,2020,"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a well-defined yet difficult-to-manage disease entity. Both the precipitous rise in its incidence due to contemporary lifestyles and the growing heterogeneity among affected populations present unprecedented challenges. Moreover, the predisposed risk for developing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in populations with MetS, and the viral impacts on host metabolic parameters, underscores the need to investigate this mechanism thoroughly. Recent investigations of metabolomics and proteomics have revealed not only differentially expressed substances in MetS, but also the consequences of diet consumption and physical activity on energy metabolism. These variations in metabolites, as well as protein products, also influence a wide spectrum of host characteristics, from cellular behavior to phenotype. Research on the dysregulation of gut microbiota and the resultant inflammatory status has also contributed to our understanding of the underlying pathogenic mechanisms. As for state-of-the-art therapies, advancing depictions of the bio-molecular landscape of MetS have emerged and now play a key role in individualized precision medicine. Fecal microbiota transplantation, aiming to restore the host's homeostasis, and targeting of the bile acid signaling pathway are two approaches to combatting MetS. Comprehensive molecular inquiries about MetS by omics measures are mandatory to facilitate the development of novel therapeutic modalities.","Kao, Ting-Wei; Huang, Chin-Chou",Int. j. mol. sci.

Safe and effective vaccines are needed urgently. METHODS: In an ongoing multinational, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded, pivotal efficacy trial, we randomly assigned persons 16 years of age or older in a 1:1 ratio to receive two doses, 21 days apart, of either placebo or the BNT162b2 vaccine candidate (30 µg per dose). BNT162b2 is a lipid nanoparticle-formulated, nucleoside-modified RNA vaccine that encodes a prefusion stabilized, membrane-anchored SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike protein. The primary end points were efficacy of the vaccine against laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 and safety. RESULTS: A total of 43,548 participants underwent randomization, of whom 43,448 received injections: 21,720 with BNT162b2 and 21,728 with placebo. There were 8 cases of Covid-19 with onset at least 7 days after the second dose among participants assigned to receive BNT162b2 and 162 cases among those assigned to placebo; BNT162b2 was 95% effective in preventing Covid-19 (95% credible interval, 90.3 to 97.6). Similar vaccine efficacy (generally 90 to 100%) was observed across subgroups defined by age, sex, race, ethnicity, baseline body-mass index, and the presence of coexisting conditions. Among 10 cases of severe Covid-19 with onset after the first dose, 9 occurred in placebo recipients and 1 in a BNT162b2 recipient. The safety profile of BNT162b2 was characterized by short-term, mild-to-moderate pain at the injection site, fatigue, and headache. The incidence of serious adverse events was low and was similar in the vaccine and placebo groups. CONCLUSIONS: A two-dose regimen of BNT162b2 conferred 95% protection against Covid-19 in persons 16 years of age or older. Safety over a median of 2 months was similar to that of other viral vaccines.

Those with severe disease are treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) but with poor outcomes. Concomitant right ventricular assist device (RVAD) may be beneficial. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of intensive care unit patients admitted with COVID-19 ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) was performed. Nonintubated patients, those with acute kidney injury, and age > 75 were excluded. Patients who underwent RVAD/ECMO support were compared with those managed via invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) alone. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included 30-d mortality, acute kidney injury, length of ICU stay, and duration of mechanical ventilation. RESULTS: A total of 145 patients were admitted to the ICU with COVID-19. Thirty-nine patients met inclusion criteria. Of these, 21 received IMV, and 18 received RVAD/ECMO. In-hospital (52.4 versus 11.1%, P = 0.008) and 30-d mortality (42.9 versus 5.6%, P= 0.011) were significantly lower in patients treated with RVAD/ECMO. Acute kidney injury occurred in 15 (71.4%) patients in the IMV group and zero RVAD/ECMO patients (P< 0.001). ICU (11.5 versus 21 d, P= 0.067) and hospital (14 versus 25.5 d, P = 0.054) length of stay were not significantly different. There were no RVAD/ECMO device complications. The duration of mechanical ventilation was not significantly different (10 versus 5 d, P = 0.44). CONCLUSIONS: RVAD support at the time of ECMO initiation resulted in the no secondary end-organ damage and higher in-hospital and 30-d survival versus IMV in specially selected patients with severe COVID-19 ARDS. Management of severe COVID-19 ARDS should prioritize right ventricular support.","Cain, Michael T; Smith, Nathan J; Barash, Mark; Simpson, Pippa; Durham, Lucian A; Makker, Hemanckur; Roberts, Christopher; Falcucci, Octavio; Wang, Dong; Walker, Rebekah; Ahmed, Gulrayz; Brown, Sherry-Ann; Nanchal, Rahul S; Joyce, David L",J Surg Res,,336

Since Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A. Gemelli (FPG) IRCCS was enlisted as a COVID-19 hospital, the healthcare workers deployed to COVID-19 wards were separated from those with limited/no exposure, whereas the administrative staff were designated to work from home. Between 4 June and 3 July 2020, an investigation was conducted to evaluate the seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) immunoglobulin (IgG) antibodies among the employees of the FPG using point-of-care (POC) and venous blood tests. Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values were determined with reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction on nasal/oropharyngeal swabs as the diagnostic gold standard. The participants enrolled amounted to 4777. Seroprevalence was 3.66% using the POC test and 1.19% using the venous blood test, with a significant difference (p < 0.05). The POC test sensitivity and specificity were, respectively, 63.64% (95% confidence interval (CI): 62.20% to 65.04%) and 96.64% (95% CI: 96.05% to 97.13%), while those of the venous blood test were, respectively, 78.79% (95% CI: 77.58% to 79.94%) and 99.36% (95% CI: 99.07% to 99.55%).

DESIGN: This qualitative study comprised five focus groups, carried out online during the early stages of the UK's stay at home order ('lockdown'), and analysed using a thematic approach. SETTING: Focus groups took place via online videoconferencing. PARTICIPANTS: Participants (n=27) were all UK residents aged 18 years and older, representing a range of gender, ethnic, age and occupational backgrounds. RESULTS: Qualitative analysis revealed four main themes: (1) loss-participants' loss of (in-person) social interaction, loss of income and loss of structure and routine led to psychological and emotional 'losses' such as loss of motivation, loss of meaning and loss of self-worth; (2) criticisms of government communication-participants reported a lack of trust in government and a lack of clarity in the guidelines around social distancing and isolation; (3) adherence-participants reported high self-adherence to social distancing guidelines but reported seeing or hearing of non-adherence in others; (4) uncertainty around social reintegration and the future-some participants felt they would have lingering concerns over social contact while others were eager to return to high levels of social activity.Most participants, and particularly those in low-paid or precarious employment, reported feeling that the social distancing and isolation associated with COVID-19 policy has had negative impacts on their mental health and well-being during the early stages of the UK's 'lockdown'. CONCLUSIONS: A rapid response is necessary in terms of public health programming to mitigate the mental health impacts of COVID-19 social distancing and isolation. Social distancing and isolation 'exit strategies' must account for the fact that, although some individuals will voluntarily or habitually continue to socially distance, others will seek high levels of social engagement as soon as possible.","Williams, Simon N; Armitage, Christopher J; Tampe, Tova; Dienes, Kimberly",BMJ Open,,336

476780,The Effect of COVID-19 Lockdown Measures on Physical Activity Levels and Sedentary Behaviour in a Relatively Young Population Living in Kosovo,2021,"The global effects of the pandemic have had a strong impact on tourism. However, the process of transformation began earlier, with the emergence of new technologies and social and cultural changes. Covid-19 has accelerated the diversification process and increased the degree of interrelation with other sectors, creating a more plural and complex perspective. The importance of tourism in the Balearic Islands makes this region an excellent case study for analyzing the current processes of change and their disparate consequences. Against this background, tourism in the archipelago is directed to follow the tenet of ‘less is more’, in a clear commitment to incentivizing exclusivity as a driver of the complex regional renewal of the Balearic Islands. In this article, after debating the paradigm shift in tourism from a qualitative perspective, we will analyze examples of changes in access to the islands and its effects on sun-and-beach tourism. Additionally, we will analyze cases that allow us to begin to define the pillars of a new, more complex view of tourism that encompasses diversification (spatial, practical and economic) and exclusivity realigned with the regional scale (Balearic). We will conclude by describing the change in the economic paradigm that points towards the enhancement of regional complexity as a guarantee of strength within the global context.","Capellà Miternique, Hugo",Research in Globalization,,336

We gathered publicly available data from GISAD and sequenced more 1,927 new genomes sampled periodically from March 2021 to June 2021 from 91 out of the 92 cities of the state. Our results showed that the pandemic was characterized by three different phases driven by a successive replacement of lineages. All stages occurred in distinct mortality and mobility contexts, with higher evidence of social distancing measures being observed in early pandemic and relaxed in the last two phases. Interestingly, we noticed that viral supercarriers accounted for the overwhelming majority of the circulating virus (> 90%) among symptomatic individuals in the state. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance also revealed the emergence and spread of two new variants (P.5 and P.1.2) firstly reported in this study. Altogether, our findings provided important lessons learned from the different epidemiological aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 dynamic in the state of Rio de Janeiro that have a strong potential to shape future decisions aiming to improve public health management and understanding mechanisms underlying virus dispersion.","Junior, Ronaldo da Silva Francisco; Lamarca, Alessandra Pavan; Almeida, Luiz G P de; Cavalcante, Liliane; Machado, Douglas Terra; Martins, Yasmmin; Brustolini, Otavio; Gerber, Alexandra L; Guimaraes, Ana Paula de C; Goncalves, Reinaldo Bellini; Goncalves, Cassia Cristina Alves; Mariani, Diana; Cruz, Thais Felix; Souza, Isabelle Vasconcellos de; Carvalho, Erika Martins de; Ribeiro, Mario Sergio; Carvalho, Silvia; Silva, Flavio Dias da; Garcia, Marcio Henrique de Oliveira; Souza, Leandro Magalhaes de; Silva, Cristiane Gomes da; Ribeiro, Caio Luiz Pereira; Cavalcanti, Andrea Cony; Mello, Claudia Maria Braga de; Struchiner, Claudio J; Tanuri, Amilcar; Vasconcelos, Ana Tereza Ribeiro de",,,336

The clinical features associated with COVID-19 are yet to be conclusively documented. Caution is needed when interpreting the severity of the symptoms as most of the diagnosed patients are those attending clinical assessments. Features of COVID-19 are far from understood. There is a suggested increased risk of COVID-19 infection among people with mental health disorders, which is primarily attributable to the challenges associated with limited resources. There are a variety of reasons why individuals with mental health disorders are more susceptible to infectious diseases. There is currently no specific recommended antiviral treatment. The interventions now used are supportive treatments to alleviate the symptoms and invasive mechanical ventilation. In this review, we discuss the adverse events associated with COVID-19 vaccinations. We further highlight the need to develop guidelines and recommendations for managing patients with mental health. It is evident from this review, there is a need to provide training programs with interprofessional, multidisciplinary communication channels.","Alshammari, Musaad A; Alshammari, Tahani K",J Infect Public Health,,336

The main protease (Mpro) is essential for SARS-CoV-2 replication and is an attractive target for antiviral development. Here we report the use of the Random nonstandard Peptide Integrated Discovery (RaPID) mRNA display on a chemically cross-linked SARS-CoV-2 Mpro dimer, which yielded several high-affinity thioether-linked cyclic peptide inhibitors of the protease. Structural analysis of Mpro complexed with a selenoether analogue of the highest-affinity peptide revealed key binding interactions, including glutamine and leucine residues in sites S1 and S2, respectively, and a binding epitope straddling both protein chains in the physiological dimer. Several of these Mpro peptide inhibitors possessed antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro with EC50 values in the low micromolar range.

RECENT FINDINGS: Although a majority of pregnant women infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remain asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic, pregnancy puts women at higher risk of severe COVID-19 and adverse birth outcomes. Pregnant and recently pregnant women are more likely to be admitted to intensive care units and receive mechanical ventilation than nonpregnant patients with COVID-19, although preexisting maternal comorbidities are significant risk factors.Early provision of neuraxial labor analgesia with a functional indwelling epidural catheter has been universally promoted, with the goal to reduce avoidable general anesthesia for cesarean delivery and mitigate risks for healthcare workers during airway manipulation. This recommendation, along with updated workflow models of anesthesia coverage, may contribute to a reduction in general anesthesia rates. SUMMARY: Initial recommendations to provide early neuraxial labor analgesia and avoid general anesthesia for cesarean delivery have not changed over time. Although workflows have significantly changed to allow continued patient and healthcare workers' safety, clinical anesthesia protocols for labor and delivery are essentially the same.","Bernstein, Kyra; Landau, Ruth",Curr Opin Anaesthesiol,,336

It has remained unclear if similar molecular mechanisms operate to regulate spindle dynamics during mitosis and meiosis I. Here, we employed live-cell microscopy to compare the spindle dynamics of mitosis and meiosis I in fission yeast cells and demonstrated that the conserved kinesin-14 motor Klp2 plays a specific role in maintaining metaphase spindle length during meiosis I, but not during mitosis. Moreover, the maintenance of metaphase spindle stability during meiosis I requires the synergism between Klp2 and the conserved microtubule crosslinker Ase1 as the absence of both proteins causes exacerbated defects in metaphase spindle stability. The synergism is not necessary for regulating mitotic spindle dynamics. Hence, our work reveals a new molecular mechanism underlying meiotic spindle dynamics and provides insights into understanding differential regulation of meiotic and mitotic events.","Zheng, Fan; Dong, Fenfen; Yu, Shuo; Li, Tianpeng; Jian, Yanze; Nie, Lingyun; Fu, Chuanhai",J. biol. chem,,336

However, evidence supporting this notion is currently lacking. In this study, we conducted a survey on the risk of COVID-19 in patients with MS and NMOSD. METHODS: The survey was conducted through the Chinese Medical Network for Neuroinflammation. Patients in 10 MS centers from 8 cities including Wuhan were included. Information about MS and NMOSD disease duration and the usage of DMDs were collected. Data of suspected cases of COVID-19 were obtained from hospital visits, questionnaires, and patient self-reporting. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was confirmed through clinical evaluation by a panel of experts in conjunction with chest CT and viral RNA detection. RESULTS: Eight hundred eighty-two of 1,804 (48.89%) patients with MS and 2,129 of 3,060 (69.58%) patients with NMOSD were receiving DMDs. There were no alterations in the patients' DMD regimen during January 15, 2020, to March 15, 2020, the 3-month period. None of the patients with MS treated with DMDs had COVID-19. However, 2 patients with relapsing NMOSD were diagnosed with COVID-19-related pneumonia. After treatment, both patients recovered from pneumonia and neither patient experienced new attacks due to predisposing SARS-CoV-2 infection in the following 2 months. CONCLUSIONS: No increased risk of COVID-19 infection was observed in patients with MS or NMOSD, irrespective of whether these patients received DMDs. A battery of stringent preventive measures adopted by neurologists to reduce COVID-19 infection in these patients may have contributed to low risk of COVID-19 infection.","Fan, Moli; Qiu, Wei; Bu, Bitao; Xu, Yan; Yang, Huan; Huang, Dehui; Lau, Alexander Y; Guo, Jun; Zhang, Mei-Ni; Zhang, Xinghu; Yang, Chun-Sheng; Chen, Jingshan; Zheng, Pei; Liu, Qiang; Zhang, Chao; Shi, Fu-Dong",,,336

Pre-existing multimorbidity is highly correlated with socioeconomic inequality. In turn, having several chronic conditions is closely linked to multiple medication intake, especially in richer countries with good access to biomedical care. Owing to its vertical structure, biomedicine often risks giving multiple treatments in an uncoordinated way. Such lack of integrated care can create complex forms of iatrogenic harm. Multimorbidity is often exacerbated by a pharmaceuticalization of social deprivation in place of integrated care. In this article, I explore the possibility that clusters of over-medication are a contributing factor to higher death rates from COVID-19, especially in poorer areas within richer countries. Anthropological perspectives on the social embeddedness of multimorbidity and multiple medication use can expand our understanding of who is most vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2.","Ecks, Stefan",Med. anthropol. q,,336

METHODS: The authors used electronic medical record data along with chi-squared or t tests to compare patients' demographic characteristics. Generalized estimating equations for estimating the odds of primary and secondary outcomes were used, controlling for demographic characteristics. RESULTS: During COVID-19, the odds of completing a telepsychiatry visit (N=26,715) were 6.68 times the odds of completing an in-person visit (N=11,094). The odds of completing a telepsychiatry visit during COVID-19 were 3.00 times the odds of completing an in-person visit during the pre-COVID-19 reference period (N=40,318). CONCLUSIONS: In this cross-sectional study, outpatient adult mental health clinic telepsychiatry appointments, largely by telephone, were strongly associated with a higher rate of visit completion compared with in-person visits during and prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.

486155,"Physical activity, dietary habits and sleep quality before and during COVID-19 lockdown: A longitudinal study",2020,"Marine organisms and their associated microbes are rich in diverse chemical leads. With the development of marine biotechnology, a considerable number of research activities are focused on marine bacteria and fungi-derived bioactive compounds. Marine bacteria and fungi are ranked on the top of the hierarchy of all organisms, as they are responsible for producing a wide range of bioactive secondary metabolites with possible pharmaceutical applications. Thus, they have the potential to provide future drugs against challenging diseases, such as cancer, a range of viral diseases, malaria, and inflammation. This review aims at describing the literature on secondary metabolites that have been obtained from Scleractinian-associated organisms including bacteria, fungi, and zooxanthellae, with full coverage of the period from 1982 to 2020, as well as illustrating their biological activities and structure activity relationship (SAR). Moreover, all these compounds were filtered based on ADME analysis to determine their physicochemical properties, and 15 compounds were selected. The selected compounds were virtually investigated for potential inhibition for SARS-CoV-2 targets using molecular docking studies. Promising potential results against SARS-CoV-2 RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and methyltransferase (nsp16) are presented.","Zahran, Eman Maher; Albohy, Amgad; Khalil, Amira; Ibrahim, Alyaa Hatem; Ahmed, Heba Ali; El-Hossary, Ebaa M; Bringmann, Gerhard; Abdelmohsen, Usama Ramadan",Mar. drugs,,336
486735,Pediatric Telebehavioral Health: A Transformational Shift in Care Delivery in the Era of COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: In Italy, one of the country most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, the first autochthonous case appeared in Lombardy on February 20th, 2020. One month later, the number of -COVID-19 patients in Lombardy exceeded 17000 and about 3500 had died. Because of this rapid increase in infected people scientists wonder whether SARS-CoV-2 was already highly circulating in Lombardy before such date. Plasma levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were shown to be -highly increased in COVID-19 patients. Monitoring their levels in Emergency Room patients during the months preceding February 20th, 2020, might shade light on the prevalence of the disease in the pre-COVID-19 period. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the AST and LDH levels from more than 30.000 patients admitted to the San Raffaele Hospital Emergency Room (ER) between September 2019 and May 2020 as well as between September 2018 and May 2019. The number of patients diagnosed with respiratory tract diseases were also analyzed. RESULTS: Data showed that the ER averaged AST and LDH levels are highly sensitive to the presence of COVID-19 patients. During, the months preceding February 20th, 2020, AST and LDH levels, as well as the number of patients diagnosed with respiratory tract diseases were similar to their 2019 counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: No significant evidence showing that a large number of COVID-19 patients were admitted to the San Raffaele Hospital ER before February 20th, 2020, was found. Thus, the virus was likely circulating, within the Hospital catchment area, either in low amounts or through asymptomatic individuals. Because of the high LDH and AST levels' variations induced by COVID-19, routine blood tests might be exploited as a surveillance indicator for a possible second wave.","Ferrari, Davide; Cabitza, Federico; Carobene, Anna; Locatelli, Massimo",Acta Biomed,,336

The Effects of the COVID-19 Quarantine on Patients Diagnosed With an Eating Disorder and Identifying Factors Predicting Disordered Eating Behavior,2021,"Background: The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus has wide community spread. The aim of this study was to describe patient characteristics and to identify factors associated with COVID-19 among emergency department patients under investigation for COVID-19 who were admitted to the hospital. Methods: This was a retrospective observational study from eight emergency departments within a nine-hospital health system. Patients with COVID-19 testing around the time of hospital admission were included. The primary outcome measure was COVID-19 test result. Patient characteristics were described and a multivariable logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with a positive COVID-19 test. Results: During the study period from March 1, 2020 to April 8, 2020, 2,182 admitted patients had a test resulted for COVID-19. Of these patients, 786 (36%) had a positive test result. For COVID positive patients, 63 (8.1%) died during hospitalization. COVID-19 positive patients had lower pulse oximetry (0.91 [95%CI], [0.88-0.94]), higher temperatures (1.36 [1.26-1.47]), and lower leukocyte counts than negative patients (0.78 [0.75-0.82]). Chronic lung disease (OR 0.68, [0.52-0.90]) and histories of alcohol (0.64 [0.42-0.99]) or substance abuse (0.39 [0.25-0.62]) were less likely to be associated with a positive COVID-19 result. Conclusion: We observed a high percentage of positive results among an admitted emergency department cohort under investigation for COVID-19. Patient factors may be useful in early differentiation of patients with COVID-19 from similarly presenting respiratory illnesses although no single factor will serve this purpose.

One of these variables is fear, present in situations of continuous uncertainty. Fear is a key variable for mental health and tracking it and its correlates might help to develop proper education and prevention programs. Currently, Brazil is one of the epicentres of the COVID-19 pandemic, with its public health system scrapped and not being able to contain the amount of infected people. Therefore, a proper measure to screen the fear of COVID-19 will help to provide improvements in mental health in such contexts. For that, two studies were performed. In Study 1 (N = 230) we assessed the factorial structure of the measure through exploratory factor analysis, and item parameters using item response theory. In Study 2 (N = 302), we assessed whether the structure would replicate in an independent sample and through confirmatory factor analysis, besides assessing convergent validity using Structural Equation Modelling and proposing a shorter version of the measure. Both long and short versions presented a reliable unidimensional structure and similar patterns of correlations with depression, anxiety, and stress. Overall, our results showed that the FCV-19S and its short version are useful measures to the assessment of fear of COVID-19 in Brazil.","de Medeiros, Emerson Diógenes; Reis, Lorena Mota; Guimarães, Clara Lohana Cardoso; da Silva, Paulo Gregório Nascimento; Monteiro, Renan Pereira; Coelho, Gabriel Lins de Holanda; Guimarães, Clarissa Maria Cardoso; Martins, Emanuely Rayane Dos Santos; de França, Ludymilla Linéia Almeida",Curr Psychol,,336

Thus, it was observed that 61.4% of consumers modified their buying behaviour at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, with those who modified it the most being the people who stockpiled the most food and went panic buying more often. This has made it possible to establish the profile of different significant consumer segments, and as a response, food production/distribution companies can implement different innovative strategies aimed at decreasing the impact of stockpiling and, therefore, the shortage of food. The possible strategies that companies can put into effect are creating a stock of non-perishable foods, increasing production capabilities in a sustainable way and, especially in light of the results obtained, boost the online sale and distribution of foods, with the goal of decreasing the amount of people in shops (which decreases the spreading of the pandemic and favours health) and preventing consumers from observing possible circumstantial shortages that would only encourage stockpiling and panic buying, even among consumers who have not changed their buying behaviour.","Brugarolas, Margarita; Martínez-Carrasco, Laura; Rabadán, Adrián; Bernabéu, Rodolfo",,,336
488843,Impact of COVID-19 pandemic lockdown on narcolepsy type 1 management,2020,"The emergency caused by Covid-19 pandemic raised interest in studying lifestyles and comorbidities as important determinants of poor Covid-19 prognosis. Data on tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption and obesity are still limited, while no data are available on the role of e-cigarettes and heated tobacco products (HTP). To clarify the role of tobacco smoking and other lifestyle habits on COVID-19 severity and progression, we designed a longitudinal observational study titled COvid19 and SMOking in ITaly (COSMO-IT). About 30 Italian hospitals in North, Centre and South of Italy joined the study. Its main aims are: 1) to quantify the role of tobacco smoking and smoking cessation on the severity and progression of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients; 2) to compare smoking prevalence and severity of the disease in relation to smoking in hospitalized COVID-19 patients versus patients treated at home; 3) to quantify the association between other lifestyle factors, such as e-cigarette and HTP use, alcohol and obesity and the risk of unfavourable COVID-19 outcomes. Socio-demographic, lifestyle and medical history information will be gathered for around 3000 hospitalized and 700-1000 home-isolated, laboratory-confirmed, COVID-19 patients. Given the current absence of a vaccine against SARS-COV-2 and the lack of a specific treatment for -COVID-19, prevention strategies are of extreme importance. This project, designed to highly contribute to the international scientific debate on the role of avoidable lifestyle habits on COVID-19 severity, will provide valuable epidemiological data in order to support important recommendations to prevent COVID-19 incidence, progression and mortality.","Cattaruzza, Maria Sofia; Gorini, Giuseppe; Bosetti, Cristina; Boffi, Roberto; Lugo, Alessandra; Veronese, Chiara; Carreras, Giulia; Santucci, Claudia; Stival, Chiara; Pacifici, Roberta; Zagà, Vincenzo; Gallus, Silvano; Giulietti, Federico; Sarzani, Riccardo; Spannella, Francesco; Del Donno, Mario; Tartaglione, Stefania; Marrazzo, Giuseppina; Pelaia, Girolamo; D039,; Agosto, Vincenzo; Berti, Alice; Voller, Fabio; Cardellicchio, Salvatore; Cresci, Chiara; Foschino Barbaro, Maria Pia; De Palma, Raffaele; Negrini, Simone; Sicbaldi, Vera; Serafini, Antonella; Bisconti, Mario; Refolo, Leonida; Landoni, Giovanni; Rovere, Patrizia; Veronesi, Giulia; Faverio, Paola; Garavello, Werner; Pesci, Alberto; Giacobbe, Raffaella; Martucci, Paola; Parrella, Roberto; Scarano, Francesco; Aiello, Marina; Chetta, Alfredo; Franco, Cosimo; Mangia, Angelo; Carrozzi, Laura; Maggi, Fabrizio; Monzani, Fabio; Pistelli, Francesco; Russo, Patrizia",Acta Biomed,,336

Preparations were based on predictive models of need, and with uncertainty regarding risk to patients and healthcare workers. Actions taken had both immediate and ongoing ethical impacts. The most obvious of these was the shift in duty of care from individual patients to public health centred ethics and decision making. RELEVANCE: In ENT, many procedures are aerosol-generating and so our capacity to provide care will remain significantly reduced. This reduction in capacity may result in difficult choices for patients when optimal care may be replaced by acceptable care. ENT surgeons may also be faced with unaccustomed paternalism when capacity prevents them from acting within the patients' wishes.

494734,Ethical Issues in the Management of Patients With Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia During COVID-19 Containment: Examples From Institutions in France,2020,"Background: As of May 4, 2020, India has reported 42,836 confirmed cases and 1,389 deaths from COVID-19. India's multipronged response included nonpharmacological interventions (NPIs) like intensive case-based surveillance, expanding testing capacity, social distancing, health promotion, and progressive travel restrictions leading to a complete halt of international and domestic movements (lockdown). Objectives: We studied the impact of NPI on transmission dynamics of COVID-19 epidemic in India and estimated the minimum level of herd immunity required to halt it. Methods: We plotted time distribution, estimated basic (R0) and time-dependent effective (Rt) reproduction numbers using software R, and calculated doubling time, the growth rate for confirmed cases from January 30 to May 4, 2020. Herd immunity was estimated using the latest Rtvalue. Results: Time distribution showed a propagated epidemic with subexponential growth. Average growth rate, 21% in the beginning, reduced to 6% after an extended lockdown (May 3). Based on early transmission dynamics, R0was 2.38 (95% confidence interval [CI] =1.79-3.07). Early, unmitigated Rt= 2.51 (95% CI = 2.05-3.14) (March 15) reduced to 1.28 (95% CI = 1.22-1.32) and was 1.83 (95% CI = 1.71-1.93) at the end of lockdown Phase 1 (April 14) and 2 (May 3), respectively. Similarly, average early doubling time (4.3 days) (standard deviation [SD] = 1.86) increased to 5.4 days (SD = 1.03) and 10.9 days (SD = 2.19). Estimated minimum 621 million recoveries are required to halt COVID-19 spread if Rtremains below 2. Conclusion: India's early response, especially stringent lockdown, has slowed COVID-19 epidemic. Increased testing, intensive case-based surveillance and containment efforts, modulated movement restrictions while protecting the vulnerable population, and continuous monitoring of transmission dynamics should be a way forward in the absence of effective treatment, vaccine, and undetermined postinfection immunity.","Patel, Purvi; Athotra, Aditya; Vaisakh, T P; Dikid, Tanzin; Jain, Sudhir Kumar",Indian J Public Health,,336

With a vastly expanding number of publications on COVID-19, clinicians need evidence synthesis to produce guidance for handling patients with COVID-19. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we examine which routine laboratory tests are associated with severe COVID-19 disease. CONTENT: PubMed (Medline), Scopus, and Web of Science were searched until March 22, 2020, for studies on COVID-19. Eligible studies were original articles reporting on laboratory tests and outcome of patients with COVID-19. Data were synthesized, and we conducted random-effects meta-analysis, and determined mean difference (MD) and standard mean difference at the biomarker level for disease severity. Risk of bias and applicability concerns were evaluated using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2. SUMMARY: 45 studies were included, of which 21 publications were used for the meta-analysis. Studies were heterogeneous but had low risk of bias and applicability concern in terms of patient selection and reference standard. Severe disease was associated with higher white blood cell count (MD, 1.28 ×109/L), neutrophil count (MD, 1.49 ×109/L), C-reactive protein (MD, 49.2 mg/L), lactate dehydrogenase (MD, 196 U/L), D-dimer (standardized MD, 0.58), and aspartate aminotransferase (MD, 8.5 U/L); all p < 0.001. Furthermore, low lymphocyte count (MD -0.32 × 109/L), platelet count (MD -22.4 × 109/L), and hemoglobin (MD, -4.1 g/L); all p < 0.001 were also associated with severe disease. In conclusion, several routine laboratory tests are associated with disease severity in COVID-19.","Alnor, Anne; Sandberg, Maria B; Gils, Charlotte; Vinholt, Pernille J",J Appl Lab Med,,336
496023,Psychological distress in patients with serious mental illness during the COVID-19 outbreak and one-month mass quarantine in Italy,2020,"In this study, Hospital wastewater was treated using a submerged aerobic fixed film (SAFF) reactor coupled with tubesettler in series. SAFF consisted of a column with an up-flow biofilter. The biological oxygen demand (BOD)5, chemical oxygen demand (COD), nitrate and phosphate were the chosen pollutants for evaluation. The pollutants removal efficiency was determined at varying organic loading rates and hydraulic retention time. The organic loading rate was varied between 0.25 and 1.25 kg COD m-3 d-1. The removal efficiency of SAFF and tubesettler combined was 75 % COD, 67 % BOD and 67 % phosphate, respectively. However, nitrate saw an increase in concentration by 25 %. SAFF contribution in the removal of COD, BOD5 and Phosphate was 48 %, 46 % and 29 %, respectively. While for accumulation of nitrate, it was responsible for 56%, respectively. Tubesettler performed better than SAFF with 52 %, 54 % and 69 % reduction of COD, BOD5 and phosphate, respectively. But in terms of nitrate, tubesettler was responsible for 44 % accumulation. The nutrient reduction decreased with an increase in the organic loading rate. Nitrification was observed in the SAFF and tubesettler, which indicated a well-aerated system. An anaerobic unit is required for completing the denitrification process and removing nitrogen from the effluent. The better performance of tubesettler over SAFF calls for necessitates extended retention time over design criteria. Further studies are beneficial to investigate the impact of pharmaceutical compounds on the efficiency of SAFF.","Khan, Nadeem A; Bokhari, Awais; Mubashir, Muhammad; Klemes, Jirí Jaromír; El Morabet, Rachida; Khan, Roohul Abad; Alsubih, Majed; Azam, Mudassar; Saqib, Sidra; Mukhtar, Ahmad; Koyande, Apurav; Show, Pau Loke",Chemosphere,,336

The causative agent of the disease was soon brought to focus by scientists as SARS-CoV-2 and later called a novel coronavirus by the general public. Due to the severity and rapid spread of the disease, WHO classifies the COVID-19 pandemic as the 6th public health emergency even after taking efforts like worldwide quarantine and restrictions. Since only symptomatic treatment is available, the best way to control the spread of the virus is by taking preventive measures. Various types of antigen/antibody detection kits and diagnostic methods are available for the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients. In recent years, various phytochemicals and repurposing drugs are showing a broad range of anti-viral activities with different modes of action have been identified. Repurposing drugs such as arbidol, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, lopinavir, favipiravir, remdesivir, hexamethylene amiloride, and dexamethasone, tocilizumab, interferon-ß, neutralizing antibodies exhibit in vitro anti-coronaviral properties by inhibiting multiple processes in the virus life cycle. Various research groups are involved in drug trials and vaccine development. Plant-based anti-viral compounds such as baicalin, calanolides, curcumin, oxymatrine, matrine, and resveratrol exhibit different modes of action against a wide range of positive/negative sense-RNA/DNA virus, and future researches need to be conducted to ascertain their role, use in managing SARS-CoV-2. Thus, this article is an attempt to review the current understanding of COVID-19 acute respiratory disease and summarize its clinical features with their prospective control and various aspects of the therapeutic approach.","Rai, Pankaj Kumar; Mueed, Zeba; Chowdhury, Abhiroop; Deval, Ravi; Kumar, Dinesh; Kamal, Mohammad A; Negi, Yogeshwar Singh; Pareek, Shubhra; Poddar, Nitesh Kumar",Curr pharm. biotechnol,,336

Our purpose was to assess the stress levels of Nursing students before and during lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Murcia (Spain), its influence on taking an online exam and how it was affected by physical exercise. This was an observational and prospective study including Nursing students from the second year of the Nursing Degree from 3 February to 23 April 2020. Three measurements were performed: one before lockdown and two during lockdown. Stress increased substantially during lockdown. Financial, family or emotional problems, as well as physical exercise, also increased. Indeed, at 40 days of lockdown, those students with financial, family or emotional problems, and less physical exercise reported significantly higher stress levels. In addition, those who passed the online exam had lower stress levels compared to those who failed. In conclusion, during lockdown, stress in Nursing students increased. This could be triggered by students' personal problems, and physical exercise may be used as a way to reduce stress. Academic performance was better in those students reporting less stress.","Gallego-Gómez, Juana Inés; Campillo-Cano, María; Carrión-Martínez, Aurora; Balanza, Serafín; Rodríguez-González-Moro, María Teresa; Simonelli-Muñoz, Agustín Javier; Rivera-Caravaca, José Miguel",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,336

These policies ranged from closing most businesses to more controversial proposals, such as postponing primary elections. In this research note, we examine the role scientific knowledge and gender played in citizen perceptions of these virus containment policies both in the general population and among partisans. We find that while a gender gap persists in scientific knowledge, both in the general population and within the parties, women are generally more likely to use this knowledge to inform their policy views on necessary government action during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings shed light on how knowledge and gender intersect to drive support for government intervention during the time of a severe public health crisis in a partisan America.","Algara, Carlos; Fuller, Sam; Hare, Christopher",Polit.

We present several visualizations of uncertainty in air quality maps, including a frequency-framing""dotmap""and small multiples, and we compare them with standard contour and sensor-based maps. In a user study, we find that including uncertainty in these maps has a significant effect on how much users would choose to reduce their physical activity, and that people make more cautious decisions when using uncertainty-aware maps. Additionally, we analyze think-aloud transcriptions from the experiment to understand more about how the representation of uncertainty influences people's decision-making.

Contact tracing using smartphone technology is a powerful tool that may be employed to limit disease transmission during an epidemic or pandemic; yet, contact tracing apps present significant privacy concerns regarding the collection of personal data such as location. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to develop an effective contact tracing smartphone app that respects user privacy by not collecting location information or other personal data. METHODS: We propose the use of an anonymized graph of interpersonal interactions to conduct a novel form of contact tracing and have developed a proof-of-concept smartphone app that implements this approach. Additionally, we developed a computer simulation model that demonstrates the impact of our proposal on epidemic or pandemic outbreak trajectories across multiple rates of adoption. RESULTS: Our proof-of-concept smartphone app allows users to create ""checkpoints"" for contact tracing, check their risk level based on their past interactions, and anonymously self-report a positive status to their peer network. Our simulation results suggest that higher adoption rates of such an app may result in a better controlled epidemic or pandemic outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: Our proposed smartphone-based contact tracing method presents a novel solution that preserves privacy while demonstrating the potential to suppress an epidemic or pandemic outbreak. This app could potentially be applied to the current COVID-19 pandemic as well as other epidemics or pandemics in the future to achieve a middle ground between drastic isolation measures and unmitigated disease spread.","Yasaka, Tyler M; Lehrich, Brandon M; Sahyouni, Ronald",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,,336

504224,Regional Anesthesia Practices in Turkey During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"In occupational settings where exposure to organic dust occurs (e.g., intensive animal production, waste management, farming and many others) workers can also be exposed to mycotoxins. However, recognizing exposure to mycotoxins in workplace environments does not happen commonly and, consequently, remains as a not identified occupational risk factor. In the last decade, work developed in different occupational settings, using different sampling approaches reported that occupational exposure to mycotoxins occurs and it's of upmost importance to be seen as an occupational concern that needs to be tackled. This paper intends to discuss the several possibilities available for assessing and characterizing the occupational exposure to mycotoxins through the description of the advantages and limitations of the different sampling strategies. Overviewing the approaches and the main achievements used in several field campaigns developed in Portugal, the knowledge obtained will be used to support the identification of the main aspects to consider when designing new occupational studies. The need for additional research work will also be discussed where new directions to follow will be debated.","Viegas, Susana; Viegas, Carla; Martins, Carla; Assunção, Ricardo",Toxins (Basel),,336
504225,New consultation liaison model of providing care to COVID patients,2020,"To affect the COVID-19 pandemic, lifesaving antiviral therapies must be identified. The number of clinical trials that can be performed is limited. We developed mathematical models to project multiple therapeutic approaches. Our models recapitulate off-treatment viral dynamics and predict a three-phase immune response. Simulated treatment with remdesivir, selinexor, neutralizing antibodies, or cellular immunotherapy demonstrates that rapid viral elimination is possible if in vivo potency is sufficiently high. Therapies dosed soon after peak viral load when symptoms develop may decrease shedding duration and immune response intensity but have little effect on viral area under the curve (AUC), which is driven by high early viral loads. Potent therapy dosed before viral peak during presymptomatic infection could lower AUC. Drug resistance may emerge with a moderately potent agent dosed before viral peak. Our results support early treatment for COVID-19 if shedding duration, not AUC, is most predictive of clinical severity.","Goyal, Ashish; Cardozo-Ojeda, E Fabian; Schiffer, Joshua T",Sci. Adv,,336

We conducted a retrospective observational cohort study of discharged patients with confirmed COVID-19 not receiving anticoagulation. The cohort included 163 patients with median time from discharge to last recorded follow-up of 30 days (interquartile range [IQR], 17-46 days). The median duration of index hospitalization was 6 days (IQR, 3-12 days) and 26% required intensive care. The cumulative incidence of thrombosis (including arterial and venous events) at day 30 following discharge was 2.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.8-7.6); the cumulative incidence of venous thromboembolism alone at day 30 postdischarge was 0.6% (95% CI, 0.1-4.6). The 30-day cumulative incidence of major hemorrhage was 0.7% (95% CI, 0.1-5.1) and of clinically relevant nonmajor bleeds was 2.9% (95% CI, 1.0-9.1). We conclude that the rates of thrombosis and hemorrhage appear to be similar following hospital discharge for COVID-19, emphasizing the need for randomized data to inform recommendations for universal postdischarge thromboprophylaxis.","Patell, Rushad; Bogue, Thomas; Koshy, Anita; Bindal, Poorva; Merrill, Mwanasha; Aird, William C; Bauer, Kenneth A; Zwicker, Jeffrey I",Blood,,336

A key research focus is in predicting the development trend of COVID-19 scientifically through mathematical modelling. We conducted a systematic review of epidemic prediction models of COVID-19 and the public health intervention strategies by searching the Web of Science database. 55 studies of the COVID-19 epidemic model were reviewed systematically. It was found that the COVID-19 epidemic models were different in the model type, acquisition method, hypothesis and distribution of key input parameters. Most studies used the gamma distribution to describe the key time period of COVID-19 infection, and some studies used the lognormal distribution, the Erlang distribution, and the Weibull distribution. The setting ranges of the incubation period, serial interval, infectious period and generation time were 4.9-7 days, 4.41-8.4 days, 2.3-10 days and 4.4-7.5 days, respectively, and more than half of the incubation periods were set to 5.1 or 5.2 days. Most models assumed that the latent period was consistent with the incubation period. Some models assumed that asymptomatic infections were infectious or pre-symptomatic transmission was possible, which overestimated the value of R0. For the prediction differences under different public health strategies, the most significant effect was in travel restrictions. There were different studies on the impact of contact tracking and social isolation, but it was considered that improving the quarantine rate and reporting rate, and the use of protective face mask were essential for epidemic prevention and control. The input epidemiological parameters of the prediction models had significant differences in the prediction of the severity of the epidemic spread. Therefore, prevention and control institutions should be cautious when formulating public health strategies by based on the prediction results of mathematical models.","Xiang, Yue; Jia, Yonghong; Chen, Linlin; Guo, Lei; Shu, Bizhen; Long, Enshen",,,336

507487,"Practical Solutions for Healthcare Worker Protection During the COVID-19 Pandemic Response in the Ambulatory, Emergency, and Inpatient Settings",2020,"The recent uptake in popularity in vehicles with zero tailpipe emissions is a welcome development in the fight against traffic induced airborne pollutants. As vehicle fleets become electrified, and tailpipe emissions become less prevalent, non-tailpipe emissions (from tires and brake disks) will become the dominant source of traffic related emissions, and will in all likelihood become a major concern for human health. This trend is likely to be exacerbated by the heavier weight of electric vehicles, their increased power, and their increased torque capabilities, when compared with traditional vehicles. While the problem of emissions from tire wear is well-known, issues around the process of tire abrasion, its impact on the environment, and modelling and mitigation measures, remain relatively unexplored. Work on this topic has proceeded in several discrete directions including: on-vehicle collection methods; vehicle tire-wear abatement algorithms and controlling the ride characteristics of a vehicle, all with a view to abating tire emissions. Additional approaches include access control mechanisms to manage aggregate tire emissions in a geofenced area with other notable work focussing on understanding the particle size distribution of tire generated PM, the degree to which particles become airborne, and the health impacts of tire emissions. While such efforts are already underway, the problem of developing models to predict the aggregate picture of a network of vehicles at the scale of a city, has yet to be considered. Our objective in this paper is to present one such model, built using ideas from Markov chains. Applications of our modelling approach are given toward the end of this note, both to illustrate the utility of the proposed method, and to illustrate its application as part of a method to collect tire dust particles.","Obereigner, Gunda; Overko, Roman; Yilmaz, Serife; Crisostomi, Emanuele; Shorten, Robert",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.06860v2.pdf,336

However, the association between long-term exposure to air pollutants, which increases cardiopulmonary damage, and vulnerability to COVID-19 has not yet been fully established. We collected data of confirmed COVID-19 cases during the first wave of the epidemic in mainland China. We fitted a generalized linear model using city-level COVID-19 cases and severe cases as the outcome, and long-term average air pollutant levels as the exposure. Our analysis was adjusted using several variables, including a mobile phone dataset, covering human movement from Wuhan before the travel ban and movements within each city during the period of the emergency response. Other variables included smoking prevalence, climate data, socioeconomic data, education level, and number of hospital beds for 324 cities in China. After adjusting for human mobility and socioeconomic factors, we found an increase of 37.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 23.8%-52.0%), 32.3% (95% CI: 22.5%-42.4%), and 14.2% (7.9%-20.5%) in the number of COVID-19 cases for every 10-µg/m3 increase in long-term exposure to NO2, PM2.5, and PM10, respectively. However, when stratifying the data according to population size, the association became non-significant. The present results are derived from a large, newly compiled and geocoded repository of population and epidemiological data relevant to COVID-19. The findings suggested that air pollution may be related to population vulnerability to COVID-19 infection, although the extent to which this relationship is confounded by city population density needs further exploration.","Zheng, Pai; Chen, Zhangjian; Liu, Yonghong; Song, Hongbin; Wu, Chieh-Hsi; Li, Bingying; Kraemer, Moritz U G; Tian, Huaiyu; Yan, Xing; Zheng, Yuxin; Stenseth, Nils Chr; Jia, Guang",Environ Pollut,,336
507641,Management and patient safety of complex elderly patients in primary care during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK-Qualitative assessment,2021,"During an outbreak or pandemic involving a novel disease such as COVID-19, infected persons may need to undergo strict medical isolation and be separated from their families for public health reasons. Such a practice raises various ethical questions, the characteristics of which are heightened by uncertainties such as mode of transmission and increasingly scarce healthcare resources. For example, under what circumstances should non-infected parents be allowed to stay with their infected children in an isolation facility? This paper will examine ethical issues with three modes of ""family presence"" or ""being there or with"" a separated family member during the current COVID-19 pandemic: physical, virtual, and surrogate. Physical visits, stays, or care by family members in isolation facilities are usually prohibited, discouraged, or limited to exceptional circumstances. Virtual presence for isolated patients is often recommended and used to enable communication. When visits are disallowed, frontline workers sometimes act as surrogate family for patients, such as performing bedside vigils for dying patients. Drawing on lessons from past outbreaks such as the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic and the recent Ebola epidemic in West Africa, we consider the ethical management of these modes of family presence and argue for the promotion of physical presence under some conditions.","Voo, Teck Chuan; Senguttuvan, Mathavi; Tam, Clarence C",J. bioeth. inq,,336

The variables used in this study are the number of positive cases (x1), the number of cases cured (x2), and the number of deaths (x3) by province. The process of data analysis uses the help of RapidMiner software. The solution provided is to combine the k-medoids and backpropagation methods. Where the k-medoids method is mapping the specified cluster. The cluster labels used are high cluster (C1 = red zone), alert cluster (C2 = yellow zone), low cluster (C3 = green zone). The results of cluster mapping are continued to the backpropagation method to predict the accuracy of the existing cluster results. By using the best architectural model 3-2-1, the accuracy value is 94.17% with learning_rate = 0.696. Cluster mapping results obtained nine provinces are in the high cluster (C1 = red zone), three provinces are in the alert cluster (C2 = yellow zone), and 22 provinces are in the low cluster (C3 = green zone).

This risk is especially critical with the on-going development of COVID-19 vaccines. The ability to track and trace vaccines through the vaccine supply chain down to persons vaccinated has to be enhanced. In this context of traceability, the global immunization community has recently set the barcoding of the primary packaging of vaccines, specifically vaccine vials and pre-filled syringes, as a top priority. Emerging vaccine manufacturers are already engaged in investigating ways to incorporate barcoding in their labelling and packaging using GS1 international standards. A specific pilot taking place in Indonesia by the national vaccine manufacturer, Bio Farma, shows the innovation of barcoding on primary packaging already underway with a relatively modest level of investment and success at this stage. This article highlights the efforts of industry and governments on the value of traceability and introduction to 2D barcodes. Access to financial resources and support from the international immunization community would accelerate such innovations leading to enhanced security of the vaccine supply chain.","Jarrett, Stephen; Wilmansyah, Taufik; Bramanti, Yudha; Alitamsar, Hikmat; Alamsyah, Drajat; Krishnamurthy, Komarapuram R; Yang, Lingjiang; Pagliusi, Sonia",Vaccine,,336

Results: The CT imaging shows pulmonary fibrosis. The viral infection produces ""interleukin-6"", which binds to its receptor, in MUC1 of lung epithelial cells. The biochemical response of the cells promotes an over-expression of MUC1 with fibrosis. Interleukin6 also causes a metabolic imbalance in NO that promotes clots and atherosclerosis of the pulmonary vessels. These results show to promote NO endothelia's formation to block both the excessive expression of MUC1 and the atherosclerosis effect of the vessels. Conclusions: This study proposes to inhibit phosphodiesterase by vasodilatation of the pulmonary vascular bed and the MUC1 over expression by , interleukin6, the Sildenafil with the SGLT2 and N-Acetylcysteine.","Menicagli, R.; Limodio, M.; Casotti, M.

513828,Tele-triaging: The Way Ahead for Tertiary Care Psychiatry in India Post COVID-19,2020,"In light of the continuing emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants and vaccines, we create a simulation framework for exploring possible infection trajectories under various scenarios. The situations of primary interest involve the interaction between three components: vaccination campaigns, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), and the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants. New infections are generated according to a hierarchical model in which people have a random, individual infectiousness. The model thus includes super-spreading observed in the COVID-19 pandemic. Our simulation functions as a dynamic compartment model in which an individual's history of infection, vaccination, and possible reinfection all play a role in their resistance to further infections. We present a risk measure for each SARS-CoV-2 variant, $\rho^V$, that accounts for the amount of resistance within a population and show how this risk changes as the vaccination rate increases. Different control strategies are implemented which aim to both suppress COVID-19 outbreaks when they occur as well as relax restrictions when possible. We find that a controller that responds to the effective reproduction number in addition to case numbers is more efficient and effective in controlling new waves than monitoring case numbers alone. This is of interest as the majority of the public discussion and well-known statistics deal primarily with case numbers.","Grass, Annemarie; Johnson, Kory D.; Toneian, Daniel; Beiglbock, Mathias; Polechov'a, Jitka",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.11156v1.pdf,336

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), another emerging zoonotic disease, has just increased the stakes exponentially. Most NTDs are subject to the impact of some of the very same human-related activities triggering other emerging and re-emerging diseases, including COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), bird flu and swine flu. It is conceivable that COVID-19 will exacerbate the NTDs, as it will divert much needed financial and human resources.

Future potential strategies will need to reconsider the determinants of health in NTDs in order to galvanize efforts and come up with a comprehensive, well defined programme that will set the stage for an effective multi-sectorial approach. In this Commentary, we propose areas of potential synergies between the COVID-19 pandemic control efforts, other health and non-health sector initiatives and NTD control and elimination programmes.","Ehrenberg, John P; Zhou, Xiao-Nong; Fontes, Gilberto; Rocha, Eliana M M; Tanner, Marcel; Utzinger, Jürg",Infect Dis Poverty,,336

514102,"A Cross Sectional Study To Assess The Attitude Regarding Online Lecture Among Nursing College Students After Impact of Covid-19 At Selected College of Nursing, Nadiad",2021,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are ubiquitously expressed, covalently closed rings, produced by pre-mRNA splicing in a reversed order during post-transcriptional processing. Circularity endows 3'-5'-linked circRNAs with stability and resistance to exonucleolytic degradation which raises the question whether circRNAs may be relevant as potential therapeutic targets or agents. High stability in biological systems is the most remarkable property and a major criterion for why circRNAs could be exploited for a range of RNA-centred medical applications. Even though various biological roles and regulatory functions of circRNAs have been reported, their in-depth study is challenging because of their circular structure and sequence-overlap with linear mRNA counterparts. Moreover, little is known about their role in viral infections and in antiviral immune responses. We believe that an in-depth and detailed understanding of circRNA mediated viral protein regulations will increase our knowledge of the biology of these novel molecules. In this review, we aimed to provide a comprehensive basis and overview on the biogenesis, significance and regulatory roles of circRNAs in the context of antiviral immune responses and viral infections including hepatitis C virus infection, hepatitis B virus infection, hepatitis delta virus infection, influenza A virus infection, Epstein-Barr virus infection, kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus infection, human cytomegalovirus infection, herpes simplex virus infection, human immunodeficiency virus infection, porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus infection, ORF virus infection, avian leukosis virus infection, simian vacuolating virus 40 infection, transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus infection, and bovine viral diarrhoea virus infection. We have also discussed the critical regulatory role of circRNAs in provoking antiviral immunity, providing evidence for implications as therapeutic agents and as diagnostic markers.","Awan, Faryal Mehwish; Yang, Burton B; Naz, Anam; Hanif, Aneeqa; Ikram, Aqsa; Obaid, Ayesha; Malik, Arif; Janjua, Hussnain Ahmed; Ali, Amjad; Sharif, Sumaira",RNA Biol,,336

Methods: We collected 26 consecutive COVID-19 patients undergoing initial and follow-up CT scans together with RT-PCR until recovery from 2 hospitals outside the original city. Seventeen patients with afferent infection and 9 with second-generation infection were assigned to Group A and B, respectively. By observing CT manifestations, we scored COVID-19, and statistically analyzed numbers of patients with changes in CT scores and RT-PCR results between stages. Results: The total score of COVID-19 on initial CT manifestations was higher in Group A than in Group B (P < 0.05). COVID-19 progressed more frequently from stage 1-2, and relieved from stage 3-4 in Group A (P < 0.05). The similar trend in Group A could not be found in Group B.

Supplementation with micronutrients, such as vitamins and minerals, has gained an increasing interest as part of the supportive management of COVID-19. Vitamin C levels in serum and leukocytes are depleted during the acute stage of infection owing to increased metabolic demands. High-dose vitamin C supplement helps to normalise both serum and leukocytes vitamin C levels. Vitamin C has multiple pharmacological characteristics, antiviral, anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects, which make it a potential therapeutic option in management of COVID-19. The use of high dose of intravenous vitamin C for management of COVID-19 in China and the United Stated has shown promising results. There were no reported adverse reactions with the short-term use of high dose of vitamin C. Given the fact that vitamin C is cheap, available and safe drug with beneficial effects in management of viral infections and critically ill patients reported in previous clinical trials, it is sensible to add it to COVID-19 management protocol particularly if the current ongoing clinical trials testing the effect of vitamin C in management of COVID-19 show positive results.","Abobaker, Anis; Alzwi, Aboubaker; Alraied, Alsalheen Hamed A",Pharmacol Rep,,336

Convalescent donor milk may provide a defense against the aforementioned issue and can eliminate the consequences of artificial feeding. Therefore, it is vital to characterize the epitope-specific immunological landscape of human milk from women who recovered from COVID-19. We carried out a comprehensive ELISA-based analysis of blood serum and human milk from maternity patients who had recovered from COVID-19 at different trimesters of pregnancy. It was found that patients predominantly contained SARS-CoV-2 N-protein-specific immunoglobulins and had manifested the antibodies for all the antigens tested in a protein-specific and time-dependent manner. Women who recovered from COVID-19 at trimester I–II showed a noticeable decrease in the number of milk samples with sIgA specific to the N-protein, linear NTD, and RBD-SD1 epitopes, and showed an increase in samples with RBD conformation-dependent sIgA. S-antigens were found to solely induce a sIgA1 response, whereas N-protein sIgA1 and sIgA2 subclasses were involved in 100% and 33% of cases.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey assessing organization-level, team-level, and clinician-level inpatient workforce adaptations. PARTICIPANTS: Hospital medicine leadership at 27 academic medical centers in the USA. KEY RESULTS: Twenty-seven of 36 centers responded to the survey (75%). Widespread practices included frequent staffing reassessment, organization-level changes such as geographic cohorting and redeployment of non-hospitalists, and exempting high-risk healthcare workers from direct care of patients with COVID-19. Several practices were implemented but discontinued, such as reduction of non-essential services, indicating that they were less sustainable for large centers.

522673,AN analysis on sleep quality of the healthcare professionals during the COVID- 19 pandemic,2020,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review was to evaluate the available literature to determine what may be considered urgent indications for total hip arthroplasty, in the unprecedented setting of the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. RECENT FINDINGS: SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus currently presenting in the form of a global pandemic, referred to as COVID-19. In this setting, multiple states have issued executive orders prohibiting ""elective"" surgery, including arthroplasty, in order to preserve healthcare resources. However, during this unprecedented reduction in elective surgery, there is likely to be some controversy as to what constitutes a purely ""elective"" procedure, versus an ""urgent"" procedure, particularly regarding hip arthroplasty. We reviewed the available literature for articles discussing the most commonly encountered indications for primary, conversion, and revision hip arthroplasty. Based upon the indications discussed in these articles, we further stratified these indications into ""elective"" versus ""urgent"" categories. In patients presenting with hip arthroplasty indications, the decision to proceed urgently with surgery should be based upon (a) the potential harm incurred by the patient if the surgery was delayed and (b) the potential risk incurred by the patient in the context of COVID-19 if surgery was performed. The authors present a decision-making algorithm for determining surgical urgency in three patients who underwent surgery in this context. Urgent total hip arthroplasty in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic is a complex decision-making process, involving clinical and epidemiological factors. These decisions are best made in coordination with a multidisciplinary committee of one's peers. Region-specific issues such as hospital resources and availability of PPE may also inform the decision-making process.","Rizkalla, James M; Gladnick, Brian P; Bhimani, Aamir A; Wood, Dorian S; Kitziger, Kurt J; Peters, Paul C",,,336

Molecular understanding of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) would greatly help advance the development of monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy, as well as the design of next generation recombinant vaccines. Here, we applied H2L2 transgenic mice encoding the human immunoglobulin variable regions, together with a state-of-the-art antibody discovery platform to immunize and isolate NAbs. From a large panel of isolated antibodies, 25 antibodies showed potent neutralizing activities at sub-nanomolar levels by engaging the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD). Importantly, one human NAb, termed PR1077, from the H2L2 platform and 2 humanized NAb, including PR953 and PR961, were further characterized and subjected for subsequent structural analysis. High-resolution X-ray crystallography structures unveiled novel epitopes on the receptor-binding motif (RBM) for PR1077 and PR953, which directly compete with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) for binding, and a novel non-blocking epitope on the neighboring site near RBM for PR961.

We used 3-year linked data from the COMPASS study, including 7653 Canadian (Quebec, Ontario) adolescents from which 1937 completed all 3 survey waves (pre-COVID-19 [2018, 2019] and online [2020] during the early pandemic period [May–July 2020]). Structural equation modeling (SEM) and double difference (DD) models were used to estimate pre-COVID-19 to initial COVID-19 pandemic period change (2019–2020) in cannabis use (monthly, weekly, daily) compared to 2018 to 2019 change to adjust for age-related effects. Models were adjusted for age of entry into the cohort and sociodemographic characteristics. RESULTS: In the SEM and DD models, monthly, weekly, and daily cannabis use increased across all waves; however, the expected increases from the pre-COVID-19 wave (2019) to the initial COVID-19 period wave (2020) were lesser relative to the changes seen across the 2018 to 2019 waves. The cross-sectional data from May to July 2020 identified that the majority of youth who use cannabis did not report increased cannabis use due to COVID-19 or using cannabis to cope with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: During the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic period, there does not appear to be a detrimental effect on youth cannabis use, when adjusted for age-related changes. Further prospective research is needed to explore the impact of the ongoing pandemic response on youth cannabis use onset and progression.","Leatherdale, Scott T.; Bélanger, Richard E.; Gansaonré, Rabi Joël; Patte, Karen A.; deGroh, Margaret; Jiang, Ying; Haddad, Slim",BMC Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34154564/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-11241-6,336

The global burden of numerous infectious diseases has been significantly reduced, and in some cases, effectively eradicated through the deployment of specific vaccines. However, efforts to develop effective vaccines against infectious pathogens such as influenza, HIV, dengue virus (DENV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), Ebola virus, and Zika virus (ZIKV) have proven challenging. Zika virus is a mosquito-vectored flavivirus responsible for periodic outbreaks of disease in Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands dating back over 50 years. Over this period, ZIKV infections were subclinical in most infected individuals and resulted in mild cases of fever, arthralgia, and rash in others. Concerns about ZIKV changed over the past two years, however, as outbreaks in Brazil, Central American countries, and Caribbean islands revealed novel aspects of infection including vertical and sexual transmission modes. Cases have been reported showing dramatic neurological pathologies including microcephaly and other neurodevelopmental problems in babies born to ZIKV infected mothers, as well as an increased risk of Guillain-Barre syndrome in adults. These findings prompted the World Health Organization to declare ZIKV a public health emergency in 2016, which resulted in expanded efforts to develop ZIKV vaccines and immunotherapeutics. Several ZIKV vaccine candidates that are immunogenic and effective at blocking ZIKV infection in animal models have since been developed, with some of these now being evaluated in the clinic. Additional therapeutics under investigation include anti-ZIKV monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that have been shown to neutralize infection in vitro as well as protect against morbidity in mouse models of ZIKV infection. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of ZIKV biology and pathogenesis and describe our efforts to rapidly develop a vaccine against ZIKV.","Kudchodkar, Sagar B.; Choi, Hyeree; Reuschel, Emma L.; Esquivel, Rianne; Kwon, Jackie Jin-Ah; Jeong, Moonsup; Maslow, Joel N.; Reed, Charles C.; White, Scott; Kim, J Joseph; Kobinger, Gary P.; Tebas, Pablo; Weiner, David B.; Muthumani, Kar",Microbes and Infection,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1286457918300704; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29555345/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micinf.2018.03.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1286457918300704,336

Developing countries that mostly have a weaker healthcare system and insufficient resources are likely to be the most hardly affected by the pandemic. Cancers are frequently diagnosed in late stages with higher case-fatality rates compared to those in high-income countries. Delayed diagnosis, lack of cancer awareness, low adherence to treatment, and unequal or limited access to treatment are among the challenging factors of cancer management in developing countries. Elective cancer surgeries are often considered to be postponed during COVID-19 pandemic to preserve valuable hospital resources such as personal protection equipment, hospital bed, intensive care unit capacity, and manpower to screen and treat the affected individuals. However, specific considerations to defer cancer surgery in developing countries might need to be carefully adjusted to counterbalance between preventing COVID-19 transmission and preserving patients ‘long-term life expectancy and quality of life.","Anwar, Sumadi Lukman; Harahap, Wirsma Arif; Aryandono, Teguh",Int J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32497751/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1743919120304556; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1743919120304556; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijsu.2020.05.072,336

Although this modification was also found in the RNA of several viruses almost 40 years ago, its biological functions during viral infection have been elucidated recently. Here, we investigated the effects of viral and host RNA methylation during porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection. The results demonstrated that the m(6)A modification was abundant in the PEDV genome and the host methyltransferases METTL3 and METTL14 and demethylase FTO were involved in the regulation of viral replication. The knockdown of the methyltransferases increased PEDV replication while silencing the demethylase decreased PEDV output. Moreover, the proteins of the YTHDF family regulated the PEDV replication by affecting the stability of m(6)A-modified viral RNA. In particular, PEDV infection could trigger an increasement of m(6)A in host RNA and decrease the expression of FTO. The m(6)A modification sites in mRNAs and target genes were also altered during PEDV infection. Additionally, part of the host responses to PEDV infection was controlled by m(6)A modification, which could be reversed by the expression of FTO. Taken together, our results identified the role of m(6)A modification in PEDV replication and interactions with the host.","Chen, Jianing; Jin, Li; Wang, Zemei; Wang, Liyuan; Chen, Qingbo; Cui, Yaru; Liu, Guangliang",Virology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682220301197?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32838947/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2020.06.008; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682220301197,336

This article provides a review of the scientific literature from Web of Science, SCOPUS, ERIC, and PsychINFO to understand the impact of interactive environments on the academic learning and cognitive skill development of children with SEN. A total of 17 studies were selected. Those studies showed the effectiveness of interactive learning environments in promoting instrumental learning, increasing academic involvement, and improving the cognitive development of children with disabilities. Based on these results, it can be concluded that interaction-based interventions with an inclusive approach nurture the learning and cognitive development of students with SEN.","Ugalde, Leire; Santiago-Garabieta, Maite; Villarejo-Carballido, Beatriz; Puigvert, Lídia",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.674033; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33995231/,336

While genetically distinct, SARS-CoV-1, the aetiological agent responsible for an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002–2003, utilises the same host cell receptor as SARS-CoV-2 for entry: angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Parts of the SARS-CoV-1 spike glycoprotein (S protein), which interacts with ACE2, appear conserved in SARS-CoV-2. AIM: The cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-2 of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) previously generated against the S protein of SARS-CoV-1 was assessed. METHODS: The SARS-CoV-2 S protein sequence was aligned to those of SARS-CoV-1, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and common-cold coronaviruses. Abilities of mAbs generated against SARS-CoV-1 S protein to bind SARS-CoV-2 or its S protein were tested with SARS-CoV-2 infected cells as well as cells expressing either the full length protein or a fragment of its S2 subunit. Quantitative ELISA was also performed to compare binding of mAbs to recombinant S protein. RESULTS: An immunogenic domain in the S2 subunit of SARS-CoV-1 S protein is highly conserved in SARS-CoV-2 but not in MERS and human common-cold coronaviruses. Four murine mAbs raised against this immunogenic fragment could recognise SARS-CoV-2 S protein expressed in mammalian cell lines. In particular, mAb 1A9 was demonstrated to detect S protein in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and is suitable for use in a sandwich ELISA format. CONCLUSION: The cross-reactive mAbs may serve as useful tools for SARS-CoV-2 research and for the development of diagnostic assays for COVID-19.","Zheng, Zhiqiang; Monteil, Vanessa Marthe; Maurer-Stroh, Sebastian; Yew, Chow Wenn; Leong, Carol; Mohd-Ismail, Nur Khairiah; Cheyyatraivendran Arularasu, Suganya; Chow, Vincent Tak Kwong; Lin, Raymond Tzer Pin; Mirazimi, Ali; Hong, Wanjin; Tan, Yee-Joo",Euro Surveill,https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.es.2020.25.28.2000291; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32700671/,336

The aim of this study was to report all the surgically intervened patients with suspected or confirmed SARS CoV-2 infection from April 1 to July 31, 2020, and to estimate their prognosis in the Surgical Therapy Department of a third level hospital in Mexico. METHOD: We conducted an observational study of patients undergoing surgical intervention in the operating room assigned as COVID, where we considered age, sex, treating department, type of intervention, and initial biomarkers (first five days of hospitalization), days of hospital stay, days in the Intensive Care Unit and reason for discharge. RESULTS: 42 patients have been surgically intervened, with a total of 49 surgeries. For Otolaringology and General Surgery, there were more deceased cases than alive cases; while for Thoracic Surgery, and Obstetrics and Gynecology, there were more alive cases than deceased ones (36% and 0% deceased, respectively), with statistically significant differences (p = 0.014). With regard to mortality for each group of surgical procedure, patients who underwent C-section or pleurostomy had a mortality rate of 0%; the mortality rate for patients who underwent tracheostomy was 52%; patients who underwent laparotomy had a mortality rate of 54%; for those who underwent debridement, the mortality rate was 100%; which show significant differences, with a p value of 0.03. DISCUSSION: we identified an overall mortality rate of 42.8%, with a significant difference between treating departments and type of surgical procedure. This can be explained because many of the General Surgery patients, in addition to their infectious process by COVID-19, had another complication, like sepsis, In the same way, we can say that pregnant patients are healthy and have a physiological condition. Finally, patients undergoing an open tracheostomy had solely pulmonary complications. CONCLUSION: There is no doubt that we face an unknown condition for which we have been learning tests along the way.

A strategy for improved drug therapy is to increase levels of endogenous reactive metabolites for selective toxicity to SARS-CoV-2 by preferential damage to the viral proteome. Key reactive metabolites producing major quantitative damage to the proteome in physiological systems are: reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the reactive glycating agent methylglyoxal (MG); cysteine residues and arginine residues are their most susceptible targets, respectively. From sequenced-based prediction of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, we found 0.8-fold enrichment or depletion of cysteine residues in functional domains of the viral proteome; whereas there was a 4.6-fold enrichment of arginine residues, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 is resistant to oxidative agents and sensitive to MG. For arginine residues of the SARS-CoV-2 predicted to be in functional domains, we examined which are activated towards modification by MG - residues with predicted or expected low pKa by neighbouring group in interactions. We found 25 such arginine residues, including 2 in the spike protein and 10 in the nucleoprotein. These sites were partially conserved in related coronaviridae: SARS-COV and MERS. Finally, we identified drugs which increase cellular MG concentration to virucidal levels: antitumor drugs with historical antiviral activity, doxorubicin and paclitaxel. Our findings provide evidence of potential vulnerability of SARS-CoV-2 to inactivation by MG and a scientific rationale for repurposing of doxorubicin and paclitaxel for treatment of COVID-19 disease, providing efficacy and adequate therapeutic index may be established.","Al-Motawa, Maryam; Abbas, Hafsa; Wijten, Patrick; Fuente, Alberto de la; Xue, Mingzhan; Rabbani, Naila; Thornalley, Paul",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.07.029488,336

The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical symptoms to discriminate between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 cases among outpatients in general practitioner clinics during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan in August 2020. Methods: The records of 360 patients who visited a clinic with suspicion of infectious disease and underwent COVID-19 PCR test between 1 and 14 August 2020 were used. The patients filled out a questionnaire on possible clinical symptoms and transmission routes. Multivariate logistic regression was used to investigate the association between clinical symptoms and COVID-19 status. Results: COVID-19-positive patients were 17 (4.7%). Multiple logistic regression analyses showed that anosmia (odds ratio (OR), 25.94 95% confidence interval (CI), 7.15–94.14; p < 0.001), headache (OR, 3.31 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.98–11.20; p = 0.054), sputum production (OR, 3.32 CI, 1.01–10.90; p = 0.048) and history of visiting an izakaya or bar (OR, 4.23 CI, 0.99–18.03; p = 0.051) were marginally significantly associated withbeing COVID-19 positive. This model showed moderate predictive power (area under receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.870 CI, 0.761 to 0.971). Conclusions: We found that anosmia, headache, sputum production, history of visiting an izakaya or bar were associated with COVID-19, which can be used to detect patients with COVID-19 in out-patient clinics in Japan.

In this study, the potential effects of javamide-II on IL-6, IL-1beta and TNF-alpha productions were determined using their ELISA kits in macrophage-like THP-1 cells. Western blots were also performed using the same cells, to determine its effects on signaling pathways (ERK, p38, JNK, c-Fos, ATF-2, c-Jun and NF-κB p65). At concentrations of 0.2–40 µM, javamide-II inhibited IL-6 production significantly in the THP-1 cells (IC(50) of 0.8 µM) (P < 0.02). However, javamide-II did not inhibit IL-1beta or TNF-alpha productions much at the same concentrations. In addition, the treatment of javamide-II decreased the phosphorylation of p38 without significant effects on ERK and JNK phosphorylations in the THP-1 cells. Furthermore, the p38 inhibition, followed by the reduction of ATF-2 phosphorylation (not c-Fos, c-Jun or NF-κB p65), led to the suppression of IL-6 mRNA expression in the cells (P < 0.02). The data indicate that javamide-II may be a potent compound to inhibit IL-6 production via suppressing the p38 signal pathway, without significant effects on the productions of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta in macrophage-like THP-1 cells.","Park, Jae B.; Peters, Renee; Pham, Quynhchi; Wang, Thomas T.

By enabling the facile testing of compounds across a range of coronavirus 3CLpro enzymes, including the one from SARS-CoV-2, we are able to quickly identify compounds with broad or narrow spectra of activity. We further demonstrate the utility of our approach by performing a curated compound screen along with structure-activity profiling of a series of small molecules to identify compounds with antiviral activity. Throughout these studies, we observed concordance between data emerging from this assay and from live virus assays. By democratizing the testing of 3CL inhibitors to enable screening in the majority of laboratories rather than the few with extensive biosafety infrastructure, we hope to expedite the search for coronavirus 3CL protease inhibitors, to address the current epidemic and future ones that will inevitably arise.","Resnick, Samuel J.; Iketani, Sho; Hong, Seo Jung; Zask, Arie; Liu, Hengrui; Kim, Sungsoo; Melore, Schuyler; Nair, Manoj S.; Huang, Yaoxing; Tay, Nicholas E.S.; Rovis, Tomislav; Yang, Hee Won; Stockwell, Brent R.; Ho, David D.; Chavez, Alejandro",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.29.272864; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32869020/,336

Both media press and academic literature provide compelling evidence that AI-based recommendations help to perpetuate and exacerbate racial and gender biases. Yet, there is limited knowledge about the extent to which individuals might question AI-based recommendations when perceived as biased. To address this gap in knowledge, we investigate the effects of espoused national cultural values on AI questionability, by examining how individuals might question AI-based recommendations due to perceived racial or gender bias. Data collected from 387 survey respondents in the United States indicate that individuals with espoused national cultural values associated to collectivism, masculinity and uncertainty avoidance are more likely to question biased AI-based recommendations. This study advances understanding of how cultural values affect AI questionability due to perceived bias and it contributes to current academic discourse about the need to hold AI accountable.","Gupta, Manjul; Parra, Carlos M.; Dennehy, Denis",Inf Syst Front,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10796-021-10156-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34177358/,336
597688,"Tumor Patients´ Perceived Changes of Specific Attitudes, Perceptions, and Behaviors Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic and Its Relation to Reduced Wellbeing",2020-10-09,"BACKGROUND: Many mental health problems emerge in late childhood and contribute significantly to the global burden of disease. Adverse outcomes can extend into adulthood if left untreated. This impact is exacerbated in low- and middle-income countries where significant treatment gaps persist. Improving mental health literacy may offer an effective strategy for early intervention but remains underexplored in these contexts. METHODS: An intervention was co-developed with children and young people (CYP) by undertaking a needs analysis combined with stakeholder consensus activities. A systematic review of mental health literacy interventions in South-East Asia was undertaken in addition to semi-structured interviews with 43 children and young people (19 with and 24 without experience of anxiety and depression), 19 parents of children with experience of mental health problems and 25 education and health professionals. A focus group was also held with 8 key stakeholders immersed nationally in policy and practice. Interview schedules explored participants’ experiences of mental health, unmet needs and priorities for intervention. Data were synthesised and presented at a 3-day co-production workshop. Attendees included 13 CYP, 6 parents/guardians, 2 teachers, 8 health professionals, 2 academics and 3 game designers. Consensus exercises were utilised to identify the preferred format, content and delivery of the intervention. A smaller group of patient and public involvement contributors worked with designers to further iterate the intervention. RESULTS: An immersive storyline digital application was co-developed for young people aged 11–15 with the primary aim of improving mental health literacy and self-management. The intervention comprises two chapters; one depression focussed, and the other anxiety focussed. The storyline format is interspersed with interactive games and exercises to promote engagement and encourage self-management. CYP also take part in group sessions delivered by trained facilitators before and after intervention use to discuss outcomes of and issues raised during the game. CONCLUSION: The IMPeTUs intervention has been co-designed for CYP aged 11–15 to improve mental health literacy and enhance self-management abilities. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Indonesian digital intervention to improve mental health literacy and self-management for this population. Implementation, acceptability, and impact are currently being explored in a multi-site case study evaluation.

A reliable laboratory assay is essential both to confirm suspected patients and to exclude patients infected with other respiratory viruses, thereby facilitating the control of global outbreak scenarios. CONTENT: In this review, we focus on the genomic, transmission and clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, and comprehensively summarize the principles and related details of assays for SARS-CoV-2. We also explore the quality assurance measures for these assays. SUMMARY: SARS-CoV-2 has some unique gene sequences and specific transmission and clinical features that can inform the conduct of molecular and serological assays in many aspects, including the design of primers, the selection of specimens and testing strategies at different disease stages. Appropriate quality assurance measures for molecular and serological assays are needed to maintain testing proficiency. Because serological assays have the potential to identify later stages of the infection and to confirm highly suspected cases with negative molecular assay results, a combination of these two assays is needed to achieve a reliable capacity to detect SARS-CoV-2.","Shi, Jiping; Han, Dongsheng; Zhang, Runling; Li, Jinming; Zhang, Rui",Clin Chem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32437513/; https://doi.org/10.1093/clinchem/hvaa122,336

In order to properly weigh risks against potential benefits, particularly when decisions must be made quickly, mathematical modeling of both drug disposition and drug action can be useful for predicting patient response and making informed decisions. Here we explored the potential effects on cardiac electrophysiology of 4 drugs proposed to treat COVID‐19: lopinavir, ritonavir, chloroquine, and azithromycin, as well as combination therapy involving these drugs. Our study combined simulations of pharmacokinetics (PK) with quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) modeling of ventricular myocytes to predict potential cardiac adverse events caused by these treatments. Simulation results predicted that drug combinations can lead to greater cellular action potential prolongation, analogous to QT prolongation, compared with drugs given in isolation. The combination effect can result from both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic drug interactions. Importantly, simulations of different patient groups predicted that females with pre‐existing heart disease are especially susceptible to drug‐induced arrhythmias, compared with diseased males or healthy individuals of either sex. Statistical analysis of population simulations revealed the molecular factors that certain females with heart failure especially susceptible to arrhythmias. Overall, the results illustrate how PK and QSP modeling may be combined to more precisely predict cardiac risks of COVID‐19 therapies.","Varshneya, Meera; Irurzun‐Arana, Itziar; Campana, Chiara; Dariolli, Rafael; Gutierrez, Amy; Pullinger, Taylor K.; Sobie, Eric A.",CPT Pharmacometrics Syst Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.1002/psp4.12573; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33205613/,336

However, mortality and morbidity analysis, important for better understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease, are scarce. We examine the clinical and laboratory features of 14 patients who died of COVID-19. The cohort consisted of 11 male and 3 female patients; nine patients aged 70 years or above, and nearly all had underlying diseases. Fever with bilateral pneumonia was the main manifestation. Most patients had consolidations combined with ground glass opacity (GGO) on chest CT scan. Laboratory tests showed lymphocytopenia in 10 patients, high blood glucose in 11, GGT in 5 of the 14 patients, and high LDH in 5 of 6 patients tested. In addition, patients in this cohort had high level of cytokines such as interleukin 6 in all 8 patients tested.

597883,Access barriers to electroconvulsive therapy during COVID-19 pandemic,2020-05-06,"Relatively small genomes and high replication rates allow viruses and bacteria to accumulate mutations. This continuously presents the host immune system with new challenges. On the other side of the trenches, an increasingly well‐adjusted host immune response, shaped by coevolutionary history, makes a pathogen's life a rather complicated endeavor. It is, therefore, no surprise that pathogens either escape detection or modulate the host immune response, often by redirecting normal cellular pathways to their advantage. For the purpose of this chapter, we focus mainly on the manipulation of the class I and class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigen presentation pathways and the ubiquitin (Ub)‐proteasome system by both viral and bacterial pathogens. First, we describe the general features of antigen presentation pathways and the Ub‐proteasome system and then address how they are manipulated by pathogens. We discuss the many human cytomegalovirus (HCMV)‐encoded immunomodulatory genes that interfere with antigen presentation (immunoevasins) and focus on the HCMV immunoevasins US2 and US11, which induce the degradation of class I MHC heavy chains by the proteasome by catalyzing their export from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)‐membrane into the cytosol, a process termed ER dislocation. US2‐ and US11‐mediated subversion of ER dislocation ensures proteasomal degradation of class I MHC molecules and presumably allows HCMV to avoid recognition by cytotoxic T cells, whilst providing insight into general aspects of ER‐associated degradation (ERAD) which is used by eukaryotic cells to purge their ER of defective proteins. We discuss the similarities and differences between the distinct pathways co‐opted by US2 and US11 for dislocation and degradation of human class I MHC molecules and also a putatively distinct pathway utilized by the murine herpes virus (MHV)‐68 mK3 immunoevasin for ER dislocation of murine class I MHC. We speculate on the implications of the three pathogen‐exploited dislocation pathways to cellular ER quality control. Moreover, we discuss the ubiquitin (Ub)‐proteasome system and its position at the core of antigen presentation as proteolysis and intracellular trafficking rely heavily on Ub‐dependent processes. We add a few examples of manipulation of the Ub‐proteasome system by pathogens in the context of the immune system and such diverse aspects of the host–pathogen relationship as virus budding, bacterial chromosome integration, and programmed cell death, to name a few. Finally, we speculate on newly found pathogen‐encoded deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) and their putative roles in modulation of host–pathogen interactions.","Loureiro, Joana; Ploegh, Hidde L.",Adv Immunol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0065277606920069; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17145306/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065277606920069,336

This leads directly to simple formulas for the fraction of the population infected in an unmitigated outbreak, and reveals herd immunity as the solution to an optimization problem. The model also leads to direct and easy-to-understand formulas for aligning observable epidemic indicators such as cases, hospitalizations and deaths with the unobservable incidence of infection, and as a byproduct leads to a simple first-order approach for estimating the effective reproduction number [Formula: see text]. The model also leads naturally to direct assessments of the effectiveness of isolation in preventing the spread of infection.

598181,Role of perceived family support in psychological distress for pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021-07-19,"This work aims to provide insights on the COVID-19 pandemic in three prime aspects. First, we attempted to understand the association between the COVID-19 transmission rate, environmental factors (air pollution, weather, mobility), and socio-political parameters (Government Stringency Index, GSI). Second, we evaluated the efficiency of various strategies, including radical opening, intermittent lockdown, phase lift, and contact tracing, to exit the COVID-19 pandemic and get back to pre-pandemic conditions using a stochastic individual-based epidemiology model. Third, we used a deep learning approach and simulated the vaccination rate and the time for reaching herd immunity. The analysis was done based on the collected data from eight countries in Asia, including Iran, Turkey, India, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, the Philippines, South Korea, and Russia (as a transcontinental country). Our findings in the first part highlighted a noninfluential impact from the weather-driven parameters and short-term exposure to pollutants on the transmission rate; however, long-term exposure could potentially increase the risk of COVID-19 mortality rates (based on 1998–2017 p.m.2.5 data). Mobility was highly correlated with the COVID-19 transmission and based on our causal analysis reducing mobility could curb the COVID-19 transmission rate with a 6-day lag time (on average). Secondly, among all the tested policies for exiting the COVID-19 pandemic, the contact tracing was the most efficient if executed correctly. With a 2-day delay in tracing the virus hosts, a 60% successful host tracing, and a 70% contact reduction with the hosts, a pandemic will end in a year without overburdening a healthcare system with 6000 hospital beds capacity per million. Lastly, our vaccine simulations showed that the target date for achieving herd immunity significantly varied among the countries and could be delayed to October–november 2022 in countries like India and Iran (based on 60% immunized population and assuming no intermediate factors affecting the vaccination rate).","Baniasad, Maryam; Mofrad, Morvarid Golrokh; Bahmanabadi, Bahareh; Jamshidi, Sajad",Environ Res,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.111657; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935121009518?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0013935121009518; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34246638/,336

We formed an interprofessional team to develop and use this tool to ensure that a diverse range of stakeholder perspectives were represented in this development process. This team, called the clinical activity recovery team, established institutional objectives that were combined with well-established procedural values, substantive ethical principles and decision-making criteria by using a variation on the well-known accountability for reasonableness ethical framework. The result of this is a stepwise, semiquantitative, ethical decision tool that can be applied to resource allocation challenges in order to reach fair and ethically defensible decisions.

The detailed virus‐host protein interactions underlying most of these processes remain to be elucidated. This review will describe some reported virus‐host protein interactions on filopodia with the aim of identifying potential new anti‐virus therapeutic targets. Exploring this research area may lead to the development of novel classes of anti‐viral therapeutics that can block signalling pathways used by the virus to trigger filopodia formation.

More than three million lives have been engulfed by this newest member of the corona virus family. With the emergence of continuously mutating variants of this virus, it is still indispensable to successfully diagnose the virus at early stages. Although the primary technique for the diagnosis is the PCR test, the non-contact methods utilizing the chest radiographs and CT scans are always preferred. Artificial intelligence, in this regard, plays an essential role in the early and accurate detection of COVID-19 using pulmonary images. In this research, a transfer learning technique with fine tuning was utilized for the detection and classification of COVID-19. Four pre-trained models i.e., VGG16, DenseNet-121, ResNet-50, and MobileNet were used. The aforementioned deep neural networks were trained using the dataset (available on Kaggle) of 7232 (COVID-19 and normal) chest X-ray images. An indigenous dataset of 450 chest X-ray images of Pakistani patients was collected and used for testing and prediction purposes. Various important parameters, e.g., recall, specificity, F1-score, precision, loss graphs, and confusion matrices were calculated to validate the accuracy of the models. The achieved accuracies of VGG16, ResNet-50, DenseNet-121, and MobileNet are 83.27%, 92.48%, 96.49%, and 96.48%, respectively. In order to display feature maps that depict the decomposition process of an input image into various filters, a visualization of the intermediate activations is performed. Finally, the Grad-CAM technique was applied to create class-specific heatmap images in order to highlight the features extracted in the X-ray images. Various optimizers were used for error minimization purposes. DenseNet-121 outperformed the other three models in terms of both accuracy and prediction.","Umair, Muhammad; Khan, Muhammad Shahbaz; Ahmed, Fawad; Baothman, Fatmah; Alqahtani, Fehaid; Alian, Muhammad; Ahmad, Jawad",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34502702/; https://doi.org/10.3390/s21175813,336

METHODS: Chest CT images of patients with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-positive COVID-19 were categorized according to the CORADS and RSNA classifications by radiologists with different levels of experience and who were initially unaware of the RT-PCR results. The inter- and intra-observer concordances for each of the classifications were calculated, as were the concordances between classifications. RESULTS: A total of 100 patients were included in this study. The RSNA classification showed an almost perfect inter-observer agreement between reviewers with similar experience levels, with a kappa coefficient of 0.892 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.788-0.995). CORADS showed substantial agreement among reviewers with similar experience levels, with a kappa coefficient of 0.642 (95% CI, 0.491-0.793). There was inter-observer variation when comparing less experienced reviewers with more experienced reviewers, with the highest kappa coefficient of 0.396 (95% CI, 0.255-0.588). There was a significant correlation between both classifications, with a Kendall coefficient of 0.899 (p<0.001) and substantial intra-observer agreement for both classifications. CONCLUSION: The RSNA and CORADS classifications showed excellent inter-observer agreement for reviewers with the same level of experience, although the agreement between less experience reviewers and the reviewer with the most experience was only reasonable.

To assess the impact of intensification of interferon administration and of the addition of amantadine on the efficacy and safety of standard anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment in HIV-infected patients. METHODS: Multicentre, prospective, open-label, randomized, phase III clinical trial. Eighty co-infected patients were randomized to receive ribavirin 800–1000 mg/day in combination with, group A: interferon alpha2a 3 MIU thrice weekly; group B: IFNα2a 3 MIU daily, plus amantadine 200 mg/day; treatment duration was 24–48 weeks according to HCV genotype. RESULTS: Forty-one patients were randomized in group A and 39 in group B. Intention-to-treat analysis showed a sustained virological response, defined as HCV-RNA negativization, 6 months after stopping treatment in 22% of patients from group A and 13% from group B (P>0.05). The lack of a 2-log drop in HCV-RNA levels after 12 weeks of treatment showed a 100% predictive value of lack of sustained response. CONCLUSIONS: Amantadine addition and interferon intensification do not improve the low efficacy of combination of interferon alfa plus ribavirin in HIV/HCV co-infected patients. Patients with no early virologic response did not have any probability of sustained response.","Puoti, Massimo; Zanini, Barbara; Quinzan, Gian Paolo; Ravasio, Laura; Paraninfo, Giuseppe; Santantonio, Teresa; Rollo, Adriano; Artioli, Stefania; Maggiolo, Franco; Zaltron, Serena; MASTER HIV/HCV Co-infection study group; Raise, Enzo; Mignani, Ermenegildo; Resta, Francesco; Verucchi, Gabriella; Pastore, Giuseppe; Suter, Fredy; Carosi, Giampiero",J Hepatol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168827804001862; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15288482/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168827804001862,336

We showed that the secreting forms of S1, S2 subunits and the N-terminus of S1 subunit (residues 18–495) were capable of eliciting SARS-CoV specific antibodies and the region immediate to N-terminus of matured S1 protein contained an important immunogenic determinant for elicitation of SARS-CoV specific antibodies. In addition, mice immunized with plasmids encoding S1 fragment developed a Th1-mediated antibody isotype switching. Another interesting finding was that mouse antibodies elicited separately by plasmids encoding S1 and S2 subunits cooperatively neutralized SARS-CoV but neither the S1 nor S2 specific antibodies did, suggesting the possible role of both S1 and S2 subunits in host cell docking and entry. These results provide insights into understanding the immunological characteristics of spike protein and the development of subunit vaccines against SARS-CoV.","Zeng, Fanya; Chow, Ken Yan Ching; Hon, Chung Chau; Law, Ka Man; Yip, Chi Wai; Chan, Kwok Hung; Peiris, Joseph S.Malik; Leung, Frederick Chi Ching",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14985131/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X04002104; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X04002104,336

Volatile garlic organosulfur compounds, such as the thiol-reactive allicin (diallyl thiosulfinate) exert strong antimicrobial activity against various respiratory pathogens. Here, we investigated the antiviral activity of allicin against SARS-CoV-2 in infected Vero E6 and Calu-3 lung cells. Calu-3 cells showed greater allicin tolerance due >4-fold increased GSH levels compared to Vero E6. However, biocompatible allicin doses efficiently inhibited viral replication in both cell lines. Proteome analyses of SARS-CoV-2 infected Calu-3 cells revealed a strong induction of the antiviral interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) signature (e.g. cGAS, Mx1, IFIT, IFIH, IFI16, IFI44, 2’5’OAS and ISG15), pathways of vesicular transport, tight junctions (KIF5A/B/C, OSBPL2, CLTC1, ARHGAP17) and ubiquitin modification (UBE2L3/5), as well as reprogramming of host metabolism, transcription and translation. Allicin abrogated the ISG host response and reverted the host cellular pathways to levels of uninfected Calu-3 cells, confirming the antiviral and immunomodulatory activity of allicin in the host proteome. Thus, biocompatible doses of allicin could be promising for protection of lung cells against SARS-CoV-2.","Mösbauer, Kirstin; Fritsch, Verena Nadin; Adrian, Lorenz; Bernhardt, Jörg; Gruhlke, Martin Clemens Horst; Slusarenko, Alan John; Niemeyer, Daniela; Antelmann, Haike",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.15.444275,336

In view of this problem, previous studies mainly regard the ISN as a static system, without considering the adaptive behavior of firms. This paper establishes a risk propagation model of the ISN based on the change of firm state, proposes four kinds of reconnection strategies to model the adaptive behavior, and uses numerical simulation to investigate the effect of adaptive behavior on risk propagation. The results demonstrate that all the reconnection strategies play an inhibitory role in the risk propagation. Therein, the effectiveness of PP strategy is the best, followed by RR strategy, and DP (SP) strategy. In any case, the effect of reconnection strategies on risk propagation will improve with the increase of the disconnection probability and network resilience. Additionally, the more decentralized weight distribution will weaken the inhibition of adaptive behavior on risk propagation.","Yang, Junliang; Zheng, Kai",Phys Lett A,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physleta.2020.126915; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33012965/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0375960120307829; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0375960120307829,336

The objective of this study was to describe the structure, practice patterns and outcomes of these vascular access teams during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a cross sectional, self-reported study of central venous access line teams in hospitals afflicted with the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to participate in the study, hospitals were required to meet one of the following criteria: a) development of a formal plan for a central venous access line team during the pandemic, b) implementation of a central venous access line team during the pandemic, c) placement of central venous access by a designated practice group during the pandemic as part of routine clinical practice, or d) management of an iatrogenic complication related to central venous access in a patient with COVID-19. RESULTS: Participants from 60 hospitals in 13 countries contributed data to the study. Central venous line teams were most commonly composed of vascular surgery and general surgery attending physicians and trainees. Twenty sites had 2,657 lines placed by their central venous access line team or designated practice group. During that time, there were 11 (0.4%) iatrogenic complications associated with central venous access procedures performed by the line team or group at those 20 sites. Triple lumen catheters, Cordis® catheters and non-tunneled hemodialysis catheters were the most common types of central venous lines placed by the teams. Eight (14%) sites reported experience placing central venous lines in prone, ventilated patients with COVID-19. A dedicated line cart was used by 35 (59%) of hospitals. Less than 50% (24, 41%) of the participating sites reported managing thrombosed central lines in COVID-patients. Twenty-three of the sites managed 48 iatrogenic complications in patients with COVID-19 (including complications caused by providers outside of the line team or designated practice group). CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a dedicated central venous access line team during a pandemic or other healthcare crisis is a way by which physicians trained in central venous access can contribute their expertise to a stressed healthcare system. A line team composed of physicians with vascular skill sets provides relief to resource-constrained ICU, ward, and emergency medicine teams with a low rate of iatrogenic complications relative to historical reports. We recommend that a plan for central venous access line team implementation be in place for future healthcare crises.","Chun, Tristen T.; Judelson, Dejah R.; Rigberg, David; Lawrence, Peter F.; Cuff, Robert; Shalhub, Sherene; Wohlauer, Max; Abularrage, Christopher J.; Anastasios, Papapetrou; Arya, Shipra; Aulivola, Bernadette; Baldwin, Melissa; Baril, Donald; Bechara, Carlos F.; Beckerman, William E.; Behrendt, Christian-Alexander; Benedetto, Filippo; Bennett, Lisa F.; Charlton-Ouw, Kristofer M.; Chawla, Amit; Chia, Matthew C.; Cho, Sungsin; Choong, Andrew M.T.L.; Chou, Elizabeth L.; Christiana, Anastasiadou; Coscas, Raphael; De Caridi, Giovanni; Ellozy, Sharif; Etkin, Yana; Faries, Peter; Fung, Adrian T.; Gonzalez, Andrew; Griffin, Claire L.; Guidry, London; Gunawansa, Nalaka; Gwertzman, Gary; Han, Daniel K.; Hicks, Caitlin W.; Hinojosa, Carlos A.; Hsiang, York; Ilonzo, Nicole; Jayakumar, Lalithapriya; Joh, Jin Hyun; Johnson, Adam P.; Kabbani, Loay S.; Keller, Melissa R.; Khashram, Manar; Koleilat, Issam; Krueger, Bernard; Kumar, Akshay; Lee, Cheong Jun; Lee, Alice; Levy, Mark M.; Lewis, C.

This study investigated the risks of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and COVID‐19‐related outcomes in patients with MS, and compared these with the general population. METHODS: A regional registry was created to collect data on incidence, hospitalization rates, intensive care unit admission, and death in patients with MS and COVID‐19. National government outcomes and seroprevalence data were used for comparison. The study was conducted at 14 specialist MS treatment centers in Madrid, Spain, between February and May 2020. RESULTS: Two‐hundred nineteen patients were included in the registry, 51 of whom were hospitalized with COVID‐19. The mean age ± standard deviation was 45.3 ± 12.4 years, and the mean duration of MS was 11.9 ± 8.9 years. The infection incidence rate was lower in patients with MS than the general population (adjusted incidence rate ratio = 0.78, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.70–0.80), but hospitalization rates were higher (relative risk = 5.03, 95% CI = 3.76–6.62). Disease severity was generally low, with only one admission to an intensive care unit and five deaths. Males with MS had higher incidence rates and risk of hospitalization than females. No association was found between the use of any disease‐modifying treatment and hospitalization risk. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with MS do not appear to have greater risks of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection or severe COVID‐19 outcomes compared with the general population. The decision to start or continue disease‐modifying treatment should be based on a careful risk–benefit assessment.","Moreno‐Torres, Irene; Meca Lallana, Virginia; Costa‐Frossard, Lucienne; Oreja‐Guevara, Celia; Aguirre, Clara; Alba Suárez, Elda María; Gómez Moreno, Mayra; Borrega Canelo, Laura; Sabín Muñoz, Julia; Aladro, Yolanda; Cárcamo, Alba; Rodríguez García, Elena; Cuello, Juan Pablo; Monreal, Enric; Sainz de la Maza, Susana; Pérez Parra, Fernando; Valenzuela Rojas, Francisco; López de Silanes de Miguel, Carlos; Casanova, Ignacio; Martínez Gines, Maria Luisa; Blasco, Rosario; Orviz García, Aida; Villar‐Guimerans, Luisa María; Fernández‐Dono, Guillermo; Elvira, Víctor; Santiuste, Carmen; Espiño, Mercedes; García Domínguez, José Manuel",Eur J Neurol,https://doi.org/10.1111/ene.14990; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34152073/,336

Unfortunately, the recognition and diagnosis of infection due to many viral respiratory pathogens in older adults can be elusive due to atypical clinical presentations and the insensitivity of current laboratory diagnostic tests in this population. For influenza diagnosis, rapid antigen tests followed by viral culture if negative, can be useful in older adults as long as clinicians are mindful of test limitations. Although specific, rapid antigen tests are insensitive in this population. Erroneous negative results may lead to delays in timely administration of antiviral treatment and institution of appropriate isolation precautions.

We aimed to characterise patients attending emergency departments with suspected COVID-19, including subgroups based on sex, ethnicity and COVID-19 test results. Methods We undertook a mixed prospective and retrospective observational cohort study in 70 emergency departments across the United Kingdom (UK). We collected presenting data from 22446 people attending with suspected COVID-19 between 26 March 2020 and 28 May 2020. Outcomes were admission to hospital, COVID-19 result, organ support (respiratory, cardiovascular or renal), and death, by record review at 30 days. Results Adults were acutely unwell (median NEWS2 score 4) and had high rates of admission (67.1%), COVID-19 positivity (31.2%), organ support (9.8%) and death (15.9%). Children had much lower rates of admission (27.4%), COVID-19 positivity (1.2%), organ support (1.4%) and death (0.3%). Adult men and women presented in similar numbers (10210 versus 10506), but men were more likely to be admitted (72.9% v 61.4%), require organ support (12.2% v 7.7%) and die (18.7% v 13.3%). Black or Asian adults tended to be younger than White adults (median age 54, 50 and 67 years), were less likely to be admitted (60.8%, 57.3%, 69.6%) or die (11.9%, 11.2%, 16.8%), but were more likely to require organ support (15.9%, 14.3%, 8.9%) or have a positive COVID-19 test (40.8%, 42.1%, 30.0%). Adults admitted with confirmed COVID-19 had similar age and comorbidities (except chronic lung disease) to those who did not have COVID-19 confirmed, but were much more likely to need organ support (22.2% v 8.9%) or die (32.7% v 15.9%).

METHODS: From 1 July to 30 September 2020, cases of T asahii fungemia (TAF) in a Brazilian COVID‐19 referral centre were investigated. The epidemiology and clinical courses were detailed, along with a mycological investigation that included molecular species identification, haplotype diversity analysis and antifungal susceptibility testing. RESULTS: Five critically ill COVID‐19 patients developed TAF in the period. All five patients had common risk conditions for TAF: central venous catheter at fungemia, previous exposure to broad‐spectrum antibiotics, prior echinocandin therapy and previous prolonged corticosteroid therapy. The average time of intensive care unit hospitalisation previous to the TAF episode was 23 days. All but one patient had voriconazole therapy, and TAF 30‐day mortality was 80%. The five T asahii strains from the COVID‐19 patients belonged to 4 different haplotypes, mitigating the possibility of skin origin and cross‐transmission linking the 5 reported episodes.

Recently, carbon quantum dots (CQDs), zero-dimensional (0D) carbon-based nanomaterials, have emerged as a fresh antiviral agent owing to their unique physicochemical properties. Additionally, doping instils beneficial properties in CQDs, augmenting their antiviral potential. The antiviral properties of CQDs can be reinforced by heteroatom doping. Bestowed with multifaceted features, functionalized CQDs can interact with the spike protein of the human coronaviruses and perturb the virus-host cell recognition. Recently, triazole derivatives have been explored as potent inhibitors of human coronaviruses by blocking the viral enzymes such as 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) and helicase, important for viral replication. Moreover, they offer a better aromatic heterocyclic core for therapeutics owing to their higher thermodynamic stability. To curb the current outbreak, triazole functionalized heteroatom co-doped carbon quantum dots (TFH-CQDs) interacting with viral cells spanning the gamut of complexity can be utilized for deciphering the mystery of its inhibitory mechanism against human coronaviruses. In this quest to unlock the potential of antiviral carbon-based nanomaterials, CQDs and triazole conjugated CQDs template comprising a series of bioisosteres, CQDs-1 to CQDs-9, can extend the arsenal of functional antiviral materials at the forefront of the war against human coronaviruses.","Garg, Piyush; Sangam, Sujata; Kochhar, Dakshi; Pahari, Siddhartha; Kar, Chirantan; Mukherjee, Monalisa",Nano Today,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1748013220301705?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nantod.2020.101001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1748013220301705; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33052202/,336

METHODS: The authors identified relevant studies via systematic searches of databases including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and Google Scholar. The suitability of each for inclusion in this review was assessed independently. Owing to the lack of publications, available blockchain-based tokens were discovered via conventional web search engines (Google, Yahoo, and Yandex). RESULTS: Of the 40 discovered projects, only 18 met the selection criteria. The 5 most prevalent features of the available solutions (N=18) were medical data access (14/18, 78%), medical service processing (14/18, 78%), diagnostic support (10/18, 56%), payment transactions (10/18, 56%), and fundraising for telemedical instrument development (5/18, 28%). CONCLUSIONS: These different features (eg, medical data access, medical service processing, epidemiology reporting, diagnostic support, and treatment support) allow us to discuss the possibilities for integration of blockchain technology into telemedicine and health care on different levels. In this area, a wide range of tasks can be identified that could be accomplished based on digital technologies using blockchains.","Koshechkin, Konstantin; Lebedev, Georgy; Radzievsky, George; Seepold, Ralf; Martinez, Natividad Madrid",J Med Internet Res,https://doi.org/10.2196/17475; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34407924/,336
610652,"Association of Human Mobility Restrictions and Race/Ethnicity–Based, Sex-Based, and Income-Based Factors With Inequities in Well-being During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States",2021-04-07,"The ongoing epidemic of COVID-19 originated in China has reinforced the need to develop epidemiological models capable of describing the progression of the disease to be of use in the formulation of mitigation policies. Here, this problem is addressed using a metapopulation approach to show that the delay in the transmission of the spread between different subsets of the total population, can be incorporated into a SIR framework through a time-dependent transmission rate. Thus, the reproduction number decreases with time despite the population dynamics remains uniform and the depletion of susceptible individuals is small. The obtained results are consistent with the early subexponential growth observed in the cumulated number of confirmed cases even in the absence of containment measures. We validate our model by describing the evolution of the COVID-19 using real data from different countries with an emphasis in the case of Mexico and show that it describes correctly also the long-time dynamics of the spread. The proposed model yet simple is successful at describing the onset and progression of the outbreak and considerably improves accuracy of predictions over traditional compartmental models. The insights given here may probe be useful to forecast the extent of the public health risks of epidemics and thus improving public policy-making aimed at reducing such risks.","Mendoza, C.

611339,Habits and Psychological Factors Associated With Changes in Physical Activity Due to COVID-19 Confinement,2021-02-17,"Coronavirus disease 2019 is a serious disease that causes acute respiratory syndrome and negatively affects the central nervous system. SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) crosses the blood-brain barrier due to the S protein on the surface of the viral particles. Thus, it is important to develop compounds that not only have an inhibitory effect but are also capable of completely deactivating the S-protein function. This study describes the purposeful modification of porphyrins and proposes compounds, asymmetrically hetaryl-substituted porphyrins with benzothiazole, benzoxazole, and N-methylbenzimidazole residues, to deactivate the S-protein functions. Molecular docking of SARS-CoV-2 proteins with hetaryl-substituted porphyrins showed that the viral proteins S-, N-, and nsp13 exhibited the highest binding affinity. Hetaryl-substituted porphyrins form strong complexes (13–14 kcal/mol) with the receptor-binding domain of the S protein, while the distance from the porphyrins to the receptor-binding motif (RBM) does not exceed 20 Å; therefore, RBM can be oxidized by (1)O(2), which is generated by porphyrin. Hetaryl-substituted porphyrins interact with the nucleocapsid protein in the serine/arginine-rich region, and a number of vulnerable amino acid residues are located in the photooxidation zone. This damage complicates the packaging of viral RNA into new virions. High-energy binding of hetaryl-substituted porphyrins with the N- and C-terminal domains of nsp13 was observed. This binding blocks the action of nsp13 as an enzyme of exoribonuclease and methyltransferase, thereby preventing RNA replication and processing. A procedure for the synthesis of hetaryl-substituted porphyrins was developed, new compounds were obtained, their structures were identified, and their photocatalytic properties were studied.","Gubarev, Yury A.; Lebedeva, Natalya Sh; Yurina, Elena S.; Syrbu, Sergey S.; Kiselev, Aleksey N.; Lebedev, Mikhail A.",J Pharm Anal,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095177921000897?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpha.2021.08.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34377564/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2095177921000897,336

METHODS: A literature search via MEDLINE and Embase databases was conducted to identify and select broad ligament herniation studies published between January 1, 2000 and September 30, 2020. Extracted data included previous surgical history, previous obstetric history, diagnostic imaging, herniated organ, hernia classification, and repair performed. The reported data has been compared to a unique case of broad ligament herniation that presented to our institution. RESULTS: A total of 44 articles with 49 cases were identified for the study. Eighteen (36.7%) patients had a history of previous abdominal surgery while 29 (59.2%) had a history of previous childbirth. Type I (51.0%) and Type II (18.4%) defects were most commonly reported with most patients reporting only one defect (85.7%) using the Cilley classification. Twenty-nine patients underwent primary laparoscopic repair of the defect while 19 patients underwent exploratory laparotomy. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of previously reported cases adds to the limited literature on broad ligament hernias and highlights the surgical management of this uncommon pathology. It also highlights the need for a broad differential diagnosis when female patients present with pelvic pain or symptoms of small bowel obstruction. The broad ligament should be fully inspected when mesenteric defects are suspected as multiple defects can be present as evidenced by the attached case study.","Sajan, Abin; Hakmi, Hazim; Griepp, Daniel W.; Sohail, Amir H.; Liu, Helen; Halpern, David",JSLS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34248336/; https://doi.org/10.4293/jsls.2020.00112,336

The aim of this study was to investigate the association of these indicators in COVID-19 with different severity. Methods Clinical data of 46 patients with severe COVID-19 and 31 patients with critical COVID-19 were collected. The general characteristics and comorbidities of the patients were retrospectively analyzed. The initial and peak concentrations of serum troponin I (cTnI), D-dimer (D-D), C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), procalcitonin (PCT), initial and peak neutrophil counts and initial and trough lymphocyte counts were compared between two groups. The correlation between the variation of cTnI, D-D, CRP, IL-6, PCT, neutrophils, lymphocytes and the severity of the disease was analyzed. The efficacy of the initial concentrations of cTnI, D-D, CRP, IL-6, PCT, the initial neutrophil and lymphocyte counts in predicting critical COVID-19 were evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Results The initial and peak concentrations of cTnI, D-D, CRP, IL-6, PCT, initial and peak neutrophil counts in critical group were higher than those in severe group, the initial and trough counts of lymphocyte were lower than those in the severe group. Except for the initial level of PCT, the other differences were statistically significant (p < 0.05). The increase of cTnI, D-D, CRP, IL-6, PCT, neutrophils and the decrease of lymphocytes were related to the severity of the disease, OR values were 28.80, 2.20, 18.47, 10.80, 52.00, 9.60 and 21.08, respectively. Except for D-D, the other differences were statistically significant. The areas under ROC curves for predicting critical COVID-19 by initial concentrations of cTnI, D-D, CRP, IL-6, PCT, initial lymphocyte and neutrophil counts were 0.76, 0.78, 0.83, 0.95, 0.56, 0.68 and 0.62, respectively. Conclusions The severe and critical COVID-19 patients had significant differences in concentrations of serum cTnI, D-D, CRP, IL-6, PCT, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts. The increase of cTnI, CRP, IL-6, PCT, neutrophils and decrease of lymphocytes indicated severe condition. The initial IL-6 might be a good indicator of COVID-19 severity.","Wang, Miao; Zhu, Qiguo; Fu, Jianguo; Liu, Lilong; Xiao, Mingzhe; Du, Yu",Infect Genet Evol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2020.104511; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32858231/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134820303427?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134820303427,336
613636,Childhood immunisations in India during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021-04-14,"COVID-19 continues to be an ongoing global threat. The elderly with underlying health conditions like cardiovascular and lung diseases, diabetes, obesity, are the most vulnerable to this disease. Curing the pre-existing health conditions will greatly increase a person’s resilience to COVID-19 and lower the death rate of the old people. Digestion and immunity form an integrated nutrition acquisition process, especially in obtaining essential amino acids and essential fatty acids from living microbial cells. A mature strong immunity coupled with gut dysbiosis in adults is the main cause of nutritional disorders like morbid obesity, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases. Nutrition disorders in return worsen dysbiosis. Human microbiome has an intrinsic duality. While a diverse microbiome provides a full spectrum of essential nutrients to our body, nutrition disorders fuel overgrowth of microbiota (dysbiosis) at many sites on or inside our body, and are the main causes of chronic inflammation at these sites. In the case of COVID-19, nutritional disorder impairs the immunity, causes hyperinflammation, and leads to the protracted overload of cytokines by the immune system, i.e., the cytokine storm. Autophagy induced by restrictive eating is an ideal inhibitor of microbiota overgrowth, as autophagy deprives microbiota of excessive nutrition for replication. Autophagy also attenuates inflammation. Therefore, as a precaution, the author suggests restoring good health in the elderly with the support from a diverse gut microbiome and daily regular food intake restriction, so as to lower the risk of developing into severe case even if they are infected by COVID-19.","Yu, Ligen",Indian J Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12088-020-00913-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33424043/,336

The transition from a model of continuing pharmacy education (CPE) to a model of continuing professional development (CPD) is still evolving. As pharmacists assume more complex roles in patient care delivery, particularly in community-based settings, the need to demonstrate and maintain professional competence becomes more critical. In addition, long-held processes for post-graduate education and licensure must also continue to adapt to meet these changing needs. Members of the pharmacy profession in the U.S. must adopt the concept of CPD and implement processes to support the thoughtful completion of professional development plans.

613878,Adaptations made to pediatric consultation-liaison psychiatry service delivery during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic: A North American multi-site survey,2021-05-24,"Governments across the globe have called for social distancing measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Secure settings will not be able to comply with these strictly, nor will they have the same recourse to the novel and creative solutions the general population does. Activities have been restricted in quality, quantity and scope; transfers and discharges have been halted and patient progress put on pause. Understanding how and what ways these restrictions will affect patients is crucial. This is especially salient given that large numbers of the general population have reported heightened mental health burden in recent surveys. However, it is not yet clear how and in what ways the COVID-19 restrictions will affect the mental health of patients in secure care. Past research investigating patients experiences of restrictions on autonomy in secure care that were present before the pandemic can be helpful here. Studies suggest that patient experience restrictions in care in myriad subjective ways. These include limitations on family contact, outside leave, and making hot drinks but also more profoundly on their autonomy, sense of self, and personhood. Quantitative studies have found correlations between experiences of restrictiveness and ward atmosphere, quality of life, suicidal ideation, depression and general psychological state in this patient group. This paper suggests how we can use past research exploring patient expereinces of restrictive interventions to guide the implementation of social distancing measures in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Tomlin, Dr Jack",Forensic science international.

Elevated levels of lipids have been reported in BC patients. On the other hand, lipids play an important role in coronavirus infections including the newly emerged disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and designated COVID-19 by WHO. Cancer patients including BC have been reported to be at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is mostly attributed to the chronic immunosuppressive status of cancer patients along with the use of cytotoxic drugs. Here in this review, we highlighted the role of dyslipidemia associated with BC patients in the incidence and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Elevated levels of lipids namely phospholipids, cholesterol, sphingolipids, and eicosanoids in the serum of BC patients and their re-localization to the alveolar spaces can increase susceptibility and/or severity due to SARA-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, manipulation of dyslipidemia in BC patients should be recommended as prophylactic and therapy against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Shakartalla, Sarra B.; Alhumaidi, Razan B.; Shammout, Ola D.A.; AL Shareef, Zainab M.; Ashmawy, Naglaa S.; Soliman, Sameh S.M.",Infect Genet Evol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134821001805; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2021.104883; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33905884/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134821001805,336

Data of 38,353 Brazilian adults from a nationwide behavior research were used. For movement behaviors, participants reported the frequency and duration of physical activity and daily time on TV viewing and computer/tablet use before and during the pandemic period. Participants also reported the frequency of loneliness, sadness (feeling sad, crestfallen, or depressed), and anxiety feelings (feeling worried, anxious, or nervous) during the pandemic period.

We aimed to assess and compare the profile of cardiac adverse drug reactions (CADRs) associated with HCQ before and during COVID‐19. We performed a retrospective comparative observational study using the French Pharmacovigilance network database between 1985 and May 2020 to assess all postmarketing CADRs associated with HCQ notified before COVID‐19 in its approved indications for lupus and rheumatoid arthritis (preCOV), and those concerning its empirical use in COVID‐19 (COV). Eighty‐five CADR in preCOV were compared with 141 CADRs in COV. The most common CADR of preCOV were cardiomyopathies (42.4%) and conduction disorders (28.2%), both statistically more frequent than in COV (P < 0.001). COV notifications significantly highlighted repolarization and ventricular rhythm disorders (78.0%, P < 0.001) as well as sinus bradycardias (14.9%, P = 0.01) as compared with preCOV. Estimated incidence of CADR was significantly higher among patients exposed to off‐label use of HCQ in COVID‐19 (2.9%) than before COVID‐19 in its approved indications (0.01%, P < 0.001).

Experimental studies have revealed a few evidences that coronavirus decayed quickly under the exposure of heat and humidity. This study aims to carry out an epidemiological investigation to establish the association between meteorological factors and COVID-19 in high risk areas of the United States (U.S.). We analyzed daily new confirmed cases of COVID-19 and seven meteorological measures in top 50 U.S. counties with the most accumulative confirmed cases from March 22, 2020 to April 22, 2020. Our analyses indicate that each meteorological factor and COVID-19 more likely have a nonlinear association rather than a linear association over the wide ranges of temperature, relative humidity, and precipitation observed. Average temperature, minimum relative humidity, and precipitation were better predictors to address the meteorological impact on COVID-19. By including all the three meteorological factors in the same model with their lagged effects up to 3 days, the overall impact of the average temperature on COVID-19 was found to peak at 68.45 °F and decrease at higher degrees, though the overall relative risk percentage (RR %) reduction did not become significantly negative up to 85 °F. There was a generally downward trend of RR % with the increase of minimum relative humidity; nonetheless, the trend reversed when the minimum relative humidity exceeded 91.42%. The overall RR % of COVID-19 climbed to the highest level of 232.07% (95% confidence interval = 199.77, 267.85) with 1.60 inches of precipitation, and then started to decrease. When precipitation exceeded 1.85 inches, its impact on COVID-19 became significantly negative.

This paper aims to describe and analyze the determinants of influenza vaccination hesitancy through the lens of the 3C model of confidence, complacency and convenience among middle-class, urban risk group populations in Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, countries in South America with contrasting vaccination coverage. Focus groups were conducted among four risk groups: pregnant women, mothers of children aged <6 years, adults with risk factors, and adults aged ≥60 years in samples of urban residents. Adults with risk factors expressed the most detailed perceptions about confidence in the vaccine. A wide range of perceptions regarding complacency were expressed across risk groups and countries, with pregnant women and mothers showing greater concerns while convenience had a narrower and generally more positive range of perceptions. Participants from Chile and Paraguay expressed the most contrasts regarding confidence and complacency. Information and communication strategies need to be tailored for risk groups while confidence and complacency should be addressed in synergy.","González-Block, Miguel Ángel; Pelcastre-Villafuerte, Blanca Estela; Riva Knauth, Daniela; Fachel-Leal, Andréa; Comes, Yamila; Crocco, Pedro; Noboa, Laura; Rodríguez Zea, Berenice; Ruoti, Mónica; Díaz Portillo, Sandra Patricia; Sarti, Elsa",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34383834/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0256040,336

METHODS: Using qualitative research methods, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 ED nurses who met the inclusion criteria, and Colaizzi analysis was used for data analysis, summary, and induction. RESULTS: Four themes that involved preparedness of the ED during the NCP outbreak were extracted: organizational preparedness, personal preparedness, patient and family preparedness, and deficiencies and challenges. DISCUSSION: The organizations, individuals, patients, and family members were actively prepared to respond to NCP in the ED. The ED nurses said that the trusted organization guaranteed personal preparedness, and the active cooperation from patients and families was a motivator for personal preparedness. In addition, our study showed that there were deficiencies in both multidisciplinary collaboration efforts and efforts to rapidly diagnose and treat patients with fever in critical condition.","Hou, Yongchao; Zhou, Qian; Li, Dongzhi; Guo, Yanhua; Fan, Jingjing; Wang, Juzi",J Emerg Nurs,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0099176720302397?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0099176720302397; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962844/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jen.2020.07.008,336

The purpose of this study was aimed to evaluate the effect of online learning during the pandemic of COVID-19 in different dental schools of different countries in Asia by the questionnaire survey. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mantel-Haenszel chi-square tests were used to analyze the difference between dental schools with and without shutdown. A questionnaire-based online survey was used to evaluate the online learning effect on undergraduate students in 13 dental schools of 7 Asia countries and regions. RESULTS: For the question that blended learning class has better learning efficiency, the agreement rate was significantly higher in the students (80.3%) from the dental schools that did not suspend face-to-face education activities than in the students (50.3%) from the dental school that was shut down. CONCLUSION: Within the limitation of this study, it is concluded that a combination of physical and online classes in terms of blended learning courses will be the future trend for dental education.","Chang, Tsai-Yu; Hsu, Ming-Lun; Kwon, Jae-Sung; Kusdhany, MF.Lindawati S.; Hong, Guang",J Dent Sci,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jds.2021.06.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34484575/,336

Evidence From the COVID-19 Outbreak,2020-08-06,"To evaluate the public interest in rheumatic diseases during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Google Trends was queried to analyze search trends in the United States for numerous rheumatic diseases and also the interest in a rheumatologist. Three 8-week periods in 2020 ((March 15–May 9), (May 10–July 4), and (July 5–August 29)) were compared to similar periods of the prior 4 years (2016–2019). Compared to a similar time period between 2016 and 2019, a significant decrease was found in the relative search volume for more than half of the search terms during the initial March 15–May 9, 2020 period. However, this trend appeared to reverse during the July 5–August 29, 2020 period where the relative volume for nearly half of the search terms were not statistically significant compared to similar periods of the prior 4 years. In addition, this period showed a significant increase in relative volume for the terms: Axial spondyloarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren’s syndrome, antiphospholipid syndrome, scleroderma, Kawasaki disease, Anti-Neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis, and rheumatologist. There was a significant decrease in relative search volume for many rheumatic diseases between March 15 and May 9, 2020 when compared to similar periods during the prior 4 years. However, the trends reversed after the initial period ended. There was an increase in relative search for the term “rheumatologist” between July and August 2020 suggesting the need for rheumatologists during the COVID-19 pandemic. Policymakers and healthcare providers should address the informational demands on rheumatic diseases and needs for rheumatologists by the general public during pandemics like COVID-19.","Kardeş, Sinan; Kuzu, Ali Suat; Raiker, Rahul; Pakhchanian, Haig; Karagülle, Mine",Rheumatol Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33070255/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00296-020-04728-9,336

622203,Does the COVID‐19 pandemic robustly influence the incidence of frailty?,2021-07-03,"When reconstructing a 3D object, it is difficult to obtain accurate 3D geometric information using a single camera. In order to capture detailed geometric information of a 3D object, it is inevitable to increase the number of cameras to capture the object. However, cameras need to be synchronized in order to simultaneously capture frames. If cameras are incorrectly synchronized, many artifacts are produced in the reconstructed 3D object. The RealSense RGB-D camera, which is commonly used for obtaining geometric information of a 3D object, provides synchronization modes to mitigate synchronization errors. However, the synchronization modes provided by theRealSense cameras can only sync depth cameras and have limitations in the number of cameras that can be synchronized using a single host due to the hardware issue of stable data transmission. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel synchronization method that synchronizes an arbitrary number of RealSense cameras by adjusting the number of hosts to support stable data transmission. Our method establishes a master-slave architecture in order to synchronize the system clocks of the hosts. While synchronizing the system clocks, delays that resulted from the process of synchronization were estimated so that the difference between the system clocks could be minimized. Through synchronization of the system clocks, cameras connected to the different hosts can be synchronized based on the timestamp of the data received by the hosts. Thus, our method synchronizes theRealSense cameras to simultaneously capture accurate 3D information of an object at a constant frame rate without dropping it.","Yoon, Hyunse; Jang, Mingyu; Huh, Jungwoo; Kang, Jiwoo; Lee, Sanghoon",Sensors (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/s21186276; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34577483/,336

These associations are involved in roles as diverse as nutrient exchanges, shelter or adaptation to adverse conditions. Ascidians are widely dispersed marine invertebrates associated to invasive behaviours. Studying their microbiomes has interested the scientific community, mainly due to its potential for bioactive compounds production—e.g., ET-73 (trabectedin, Yondelis), an anticancer drug. However, these symbiotic interactions embrace several environmental and biological functions with high ecological relevance, inspiring diverse biotechnological applications. We thoroughly reviewed microbiome studies (microscopic to metagenomic approaches) of around 171 hosts, worldwide dispersed, occurring at different domains of life (Archaea, Bacteria, Eukarya), to illuminate the functions and bioactive potential of associated organisms in ascidians. Associations with Bacteria are the most prevalent, namely with Cyanobacteria, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria and Planctomycetes phyla. The microbiomes of ascidians belonging to Aplousobranchia order have been the most studied. The integration of worldwide studies characterizing ascidians’ microbiome composition revealed several functions including UV protection, bioaccumulation of heavy metals and defense against fouling or predators through production of natural products, chemical signals or competition. The critical assessment and characterization of these communities is extremely valuable to comprehend their biological/ecological role and biotechnological potential.","Matos, Ana; Antunes, Agostinho",Mar Drugs,https://doi.org/10.3390/md19070370; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34206769/,336

In the circulation, these membranous vesicles are mainly derived from blood or vascular cells, and they carry cargos with distinct molecular signatures reflecting the origin and activation state of parent cells that produce them, thus providing a powerful tool for diagnosis and prognosis of pathological conditions. Functionally, circulating EVs mediate tissue-tissue communication by transporting bioactive cargos to local and distant sites, where they directly interact with target cells to alter their function. Recent evidence points to the critical contributions of EVs to the pathogenesis of vascular endothelial barrier dysfunction during inflammatory response to injury or infection. In this review, we provide a brief summary of the current knowledge on EV biology and advanced techniques in EV isolation and characterization. This is followed by a discussion focusing on the role and mechanisms of EVs in regulating blood-endothelium interactions and vascular permeability during inflammation. We conclude with a translational perspective on the diagnostic and therapeutic potential of EVs in vascular injury or infectious diseases, such as COVID-19.","Chatterjee, Victor; Yang, Xiaoyuan; Ma, Yonggang; Wu, Mack H.; Yuan, Sarah Y.",Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33035434/; https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpheart.00579.2020,336

One of these concerning body composition (in this context; bone, lean and adipose tissue) is osteosarcopenic adiposity (OSA) syndrome. OSA occurs most often with aging, but also in cases of some chronic diseases and is exacerbated with the presence of low-grade chronic inflammation (LGCI). OSA has been associated with poor nutrition, metabolic disorders and diminished functional abilities. This paper addresses various influences on OSA and LGCI, as well as their mutual action on each other, and provides nutritional and behavioral approaches which could be personalized to help with either preventing or managing OSA and LGCI in general, and specifically in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. Addressed in more detail are nutritional recommendations for and roles of macro- and micronutrients and bioactive food components; the microbiome; and optimal physical activity regimens. Other issues, such as food insecurity and nutritional inadequacy, circadian misalignment and shift workers are addressed as well. Since there is still a lack of longer-term primary studies in COVID-19 patients (either acute or recovered) and interventions for OSA improvement, this discussion is based on the existing knowledge, scientific hypotheses and observations derived from similar conditions or studies just being published at the time of this writing.","Ilich, Jasminka Z.",Nutrients,https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12123898; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33419325/,336

In doing so, the system dynamics model captures the roles of undocumented cases on the Italian COVID-19 flow. The model also considers two types of measures including behavioral measures and lockdown measures as they are embedded in the model. It is hoped that the model can enhance our understanding of the roles of undocumented cases, so-called asymptomatic cases, and the efficacy of two different policies on the COVID-19 flow. This study concludes that the first policy is important once the number of infected cases is relatively low. However, once the number of infected cases is very high so the society cannot identify infected and disinfected people, the second policy must be applied soon.

We quantified SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater influent and primary settled solids in two wastewater treatment plants to inform the pre-analytical and analytical approaches, and to assess whether influent or solids harbored more viral targets. The primary settled solids samples resulted in higher SARS-CoV-2 detection frequencies than the corresponding influent samples. Likewise, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was more readily detected in solids using one-step digital droplet (dd)RT-PCR than with two-step RT-QPCR and two-step ddRT-PCR, likely owing to reduced inhibition with the one-step ddRT-PCR assay. We subsequently analyzed a longitudinal time series of 89 settled solids samples from a single plant for SARS-CoV-2 RNA as well as coronavirus recovery (bovine coronavirus) and fecal strength (pepper mild mottle virus, PMMoV) controls. SARS-CoV-2 RNA targets N1 and N2 concentrations correlate positively and significantly with COVID-19 clinical confirmed case counts in the sewershed.

The objective of this study was to assess the factors associated with the increased levels of mental health burden among a sample of undergraduate college students in Northern New Jersey, the region of the U.S. severely impacted by the outbreak of COVID-19. METHODS: College students (N = 162) enrolled in an introductory core curriculum course completed a cross-sectional survey. The survey collected information on demographics, knowledge levels and sources of COVID-19 information, behavior changes, academic and everyday difficulties, and mental health measurements (depression, anxiety, somatization, and stress). Multivariable regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with mental health outcomes. RESULTS: Descriptive findings indicate that students have a fundamental knowledge of COVID-19 transmission and common symptoms. Students tend to use and trust the official sources and have changed their behaviors in accordance with public health recommendations (i.e., increased hand washing, wearing mask). However, students reported a number of academic and everyday difficulties and high levels of mental health distress. High levels of depression were associated with difficulties in focusing on academic work and with employment losses, while higher levels of anxiety were more likely to be reported by students other than freshmen and those who spend more than one hour per day looking for information on COVID-19. Inability to focus on academic work and an elevated concern with COVID-19 were more likely to be associated with higher levels of somatization, while trusting news sources was associated with lower levels of somatization. Those with higher levels of perceived stress were more likely to be females, unable to focus on academic work, and report difficulties in obtaining medications and cleaning supplies. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic is making a significant negative impact on mental health of college students.

We noted gene transfer efficiencies similar to that observed for human airway epithelia (HAE). Interestingly, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)-based vectors transduced immortalized pig cells as well as pig primary cells more efficiently than HIV-1–based vectors. PAE express TRIM5α, a well-characterized species-specific lentiviral restriction factor. We contrasted the restrictive properties of porcine TRIM5α against FIV- and HIV-based vectors using gain and loss of function approaches. We observed no effect on HIV-1 or FIV conferred transgene expression in response to porcine TRIM5α overexpression or knockdown. To evaluate the ability of GP64-FIV to transduce porcine airways in vivo, we delivered vector expressing mCherry to the tracheal lobe of the lung and the ethmoid sinus of 4-week-old pigs. One week later, epithelial cells expressing mCherry were readily detected. Our findings indicate that pseudotyped FIV vectors confer similar tropisms in porcine epithelia as observed in human HAE and provide further support for the selection of GP64 as an appropriate envelope pseudotype for future preclinical gene therapy studies in the porcine model of cystic fibrosis (CF).","Sinn, Patrick L; Cooney, Ashley L; Oakland, Mayumi; Dylla, Douglas E; Wallen, Tanner J; Pezzulo, Alejandro A; Chang, Eugene H; McCray, Paul B",Mol Ther Nucleic Acids,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2162253116301123; https://doi.org/10.1038/mtna.2012.47; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23187455/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2162253116301123,336

628727,Disrupted Access to Therapies and Impact on Well-Being During the COVID-19 Pandemic for Children With Motor Impairment and Their Caregivers,2021-06-07,"SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel viral pathogen that causes a clinical disease called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Although most COVID-19 cases are asymptomatic or involve mild upper respiratory tract symptoms, a significant number of patients develop severe or critical disease. Patients with severe COVID-19 commonly present with viral pneumonia that may progress to life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Patients with COVID-19 are also predisposed to venous and arterial thromboses that are associated with a poorer prognosis. The present study identified the emergence of a low-density inflammatory neutrophil (LDN) population expressing intermediate levels of CD16 (CD16(Int)) in patients with COVID-19. These cells demonstrated proinflammatory gene signatures, activated platelets, spontaneously formed neutrophil extracellular traps, and enhanced phagocytic capacity and cytokine production. Strikingly, CD16(Int) neutrophils were also the major immune cells within the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, exhibiting increased CXCR3 but loss of CD44 and CD38 expression. The percentage of circulating CD16(Int) LDNs was associated with D-dimer, ferritin, and systemic IL-6 and TNF-α levels and changed over time with altered disease status. Our data suggest that the CD16(Int) LDN subset contributes to COVID-19–associated coagulopathy, systemic inflammation, and ARDS. The frequency of that LDN subset in the circulation could serve as an adjunct clinical marker to monitor disease status and progression.","Morrissey, Samantha M.; Geller, Anne E.; Hu, Xiaoling; Tieri, David; Ding, Chuanlin; Klaes, Christopher K.; Cooke, Elizabeth A.; Woeste, Matthew R.; Martin, Zachary C.; Chen, Oscar; Bush, Sarah E.; Zhang, Huang-ge; Cavallazzi, Rodrigo; Clifford, Sean P.; Chen, James; Ghare, Smita; Barve, Shirish S.; Cai, Lu; Kong, Maiying; Rouchka, Eric C.; McLeish, Kenneth R.; Uriarte, Silvia M.; Watson, Corey T.; Huang, Jiapeng; Yan, Jun",JCI insight,https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.148435; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33986193/,336

In the present study, we found that recombinant human interferon-alpha (IFNa) triggers intrinsic and extrinsic cellular antiviral responses, as well as reduces replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in vitro. Although IFNa alone was insufficient to completely abolish SARS-CoV-2 replication, combinations of IFNa with remdesivir or other antiviral agents (EIDD-2801, camostat, cycloheximide, or convalescent serum) showed strong synergy and effectively inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung epithelial Calu-3 cells. Furthermore, we showed that the IFNa-remdesivir combination suppressed virus replication in human lung organoids, and that its single prophylactic dose attenuated SARS-CoV-2 infection in lungs of Syrian hamsters. Transcriptome and metabolomic analyses showed that the combination of IFNa-remdesivir suppressed virus-mediated changes in infected cells, although it affected the homeostasis of uninfected cells. We also demonstrated synergistic antiviral activity of IFNa2a-based combinations against other virus infections in vitro. Altogether, our results indicate that IFNa2a-based combination therapies can achieve higher efficacy while requiring lower dosage compared to monotherapies, making them attractive targets for further pre-clinical and clinical development.","Ianevski, Aleksandr; Yao, Rouan; Zusinaite, Eva; Lello, Laura Sandra; Wang, Sainan; Jo, Eunji; Yang, Jaewon; Ravlo, Erlend; Wang, Wei; Lysvand, Hilde; Løseth, Kirsti; Oksenych, Valentyn; Tenson, Tanel; Windisch, Marc P.; Poranen, Minna; Nieminen, Anni I.; Nordbø, Svein Arne; Fenstad, Mona Høysæter; Grødeland, Gunnveig; Aukrust, Pål; Trøseid, Marius; Kantele, Anu; Vitkauskiene, Astra; Legrand, Nicolas; Merits, Andres; Bjørås, Magnar; Kainov, Denis E.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.05.425331,336

Two weeks later, he acquired severe COVID-19 pneumonia complicated with type 1 respiratory failure and haemodynamic instability. He was treated with non-invasive ventilation and inotropic support with a vasopressor-augmenting dose of steroids. Management challenges were diagnosing the respiratory pathologies with limited investigations, deciding on continuation of steroids in an organ transplant recipient with disseminated infection and deciding the ceiling of care in a low-resource setting given the background of multiple pulmonary insults. A multidisciplinary team decided to continue high-dose steroids and escalate to a full ceiling of care. He recovered from COVID-19 pneumonia 15 days following diagnosis and was discharged home.

We aimed to conduct a timely assessment of the psychological burden and experience on medical student volunteers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We used the 21-item Depression Anxiety Stress Scales to survey the psychology burden of students in April 2020. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with nine medical students who signed up for volunteer activities in Chinese from February to April 2020. Quantitative and qualitative methods were used to analyze the data. Results: The detection of depression, anxiety and stress of medical student volunteers were 26.8%, 20.2% and 11.1%, respectively. The volunteer’s negative emotions were more pronounced before work and diminished gradually. Most participants expressed no concern about being infected themselves, but worry about family infection. Participant’s motivations for volunteering were primarily their duties as medical students and encouragement from their families/teachers. The vast majority of medical students said they would be willing to work as medical assistants again and this experience would not affect their career choice. Conclusions: Chinese medical student volunteers tended to show negative emotions at the beginning of their work, and then gradually declined, while positive emotions emerged. Most medical students were willing to volunteer as medical assistants when their country needed them due to their sense of responsibility as medical students. This study on the psychological and experiential aspects were derived from Chinese medical student volunteers and might have a significant impact on future public health emergencies in similar settings.","Zhang, Kaiting; Peng, Yixiang; Zhang, Xiaowei; Li, Liping",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18084089; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33924448/,336

The aim is to quantify it according to sick leave. Methods: Using ICD-9 codes, we analyzed Ibermutua records of all sick leaves during the first trimester of 2020, compared to during the same months of 2017, 2018, and 2019. We stratified the analysis by causes, patient sex, activity sectors, and regional data. All sick leaves were adjusted by the number of Ibermutua-affiliated persons in each period. Results: In March 2020, there was an unprecedented (116%) increase in total sick leaves, mainly due to infectious and respiratory diseases. Men and women were equally affected. All activity sectors were impacted, with the highest increase (457%) observed among health-related workers, especially due to contagious disease. The incidences of sick leaves were heterogeneous among different regions. Cost-analysis of sick leaves during the first trimester of 2020 compared with in previous years showed 40.3% increment (mean 2,813 vs. 2,005 € per 100 affiliated workers). Conclusions: The SARS-COV2 pandemic is having a huge impact on workers' health, as shown by data regarding sick leaves in March 2020. This is associated with greater economic burden for companies, both due to the cost associated with sick leaves and the losses in productivity due to confinement.","Calvo-Bonacho, Eva; Catalina-Romero, Carlos; Fernández-Labandera, Carlos; Fernández-Meseguer, Ana; González-Quintela, Arturo; Martínez-Muñoz, Paloma; Quevedo, Luis; Valdivielso, Pedro; Sánchez-Chaparro, Miguel Ángel",Front Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.580546; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33194983/,336

It is a prominently respiratory infection, with potential cardiological, hematological, gastrointestinal and renal complications. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is found in 0.5-25% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and constitutes a negative prognostic factor. Renal damage mechanisms are not completely clear. We report the clinical evolution of hospitalized COVID-19 patients who presented with AKI requiring attention from the Nephrology team in a tertiary hospital in Madrid, Spain. Methods This is an observational prospective study including all COVID-19 cases that required hospitalization and Nephrology management from March 6th to May 12th. We collected clinical and analytical data of baseline characteristics, COVID-19 and AKI evolutions. Results We analyzed 41 patients with a mean age of 66.8 years (SD 2.1), 90.2% males, and with a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in 36.6%. 56.1% of patients presented with sever pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and 31.7% required intensive care. AKI etiology was prerenal in 61%, acute tubular necrosis in the context of sepsis in 24.4%, glomerular in 7.3% and tubular toxicity in 7.3% of the cases. We reported proteinuria in 88.9% and hematuria in 79.4% of patients. 48.8% of patients required renal replacement therapy (RRT). Median length of stay was 12 days (interquartilic range 9-23) and 22% of the population died. Patients who developed AKI during hospital stay presented with higher C-reactive protein, Lactate dehydrogenase-LDH and D-dimer values, more severe pulmonary damage, more frequent intensive care unit-ICU admission, treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir and biological drugs and RRT requirement. Conclusions Hypovolemia and dehydration are a frequent cause of AKI among COVID-19 patients. Those who develop AKI during hospitalization display worse prognostic factors in terms of pulmonary damage, renal damage, and analytical findings. We believe that monitorization of renal markers as well as individualized fluid management can play a key role in AKI prevention.","Tarragón, Blanca; Valdenebro, María; Serrano, Maria Luisa; Maroto, Alba; Llópez-Carratalá, M.

This cross-sectional survey was conducted to evaluate physicians' awareness, attitude, and current practices toward influenza vaccination in high-risk groups in India. Methods: The survey was performed in June–July 2020, wherein consulting physicians, pulmonologists, diabetologists, obstetricians/gynecologists, or cardiologists across 14 cities completed a 39-item questionnaire consisting of 3 sections, one each on awareness, attitude, and practice patterns. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the study results. Statistical analysis was performed for comparison of subgroups by physician specialty, city of practice (metro/non-metro), and zone of practice (north/south/east/west). Level of statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Results: In all, 780 physicians completed the survey. Of these, 3.97, 53.08, and 42.95% had high, medium, and low level of awareness about influenza/influenza vaccination, respectively. Statistically significant (p < 0.05) between-group differences were found by physician specialty and zone of practice. In terms of attitude toward vaccination of high-risk group subjects, only 0.9% physicians were “extremely concerned,” while the majority (92.56%) were “quite concerned” and 6.54% were a “little concerned,” with no reported significant differences between different subgroups. With regard to practice patterns, 82.82% of physicians offered influenza vaccines to their patients, 32.69% vaccinated 10–25% of patients per month, and 38.85% required and offered the vaccine to their office staff. Physicians' reasons for not prescribing influenza vaccines to patients included fear of side effects (16.54%), cost (15.64%), lack of awareness about availability (15.38%), absence of belief that it is beneficial (14.36%), history of side effects (13.46%), and patients' fear of needles (11.28%). Conclusion: These findings suggest the need to implement educational strategies among physicians to enhance their awareness about influenza vaccination and improve their attitudes and current practices toward influenza vaccination especially in high-risk groups in India.","Vora, Agam; Shaikh, Ashfaque",Front Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.642636; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34497789/,336

The Working Alliance Inventory for online interventions (WAI-TECH-SF) was adapted based on the WAI Short Form (Hatcher & Gillaspy, 2006). The objectives of this study were: (1) to analyse the psychometric properties of the WAI-TECH-SF; (2) to explore the differences in the WAI-TECH-SF scores according to different categories of the sample; and (3) to analyse whether the WAI-TECH-SF can predict therapeutic outcomes and satisfaction with the treatment. Methods: 193 patients diagnosed with depression were included and received blended Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy. Measures of preferences, satisfaction, and credibility about the treatment, TA with the online program, depressive symptoms, and satisfaction with the treatment were administered. Results: An exploratory factor analysis revealed a one-dimensional structure with adequate internal consistency. Linear regression analyses showed that the WAI-TECH-SF predicted changes in depressive symptoms and satisfaction with the treatment. Conclusions: WAI-TECH-SF is a reliable questionnaire to assess the TA between the patient and the online program, which is associated with positive therapeutic outcomes and satisfaction with the treatment.","Herrero, Rocío; Vara, Mª Dolores; Miragall, Marta; Botella, Cristina; García-Palacios, Azucena; Riper, Heleen; Kleiboer, Annet; Baños, Rosa Mª",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32854381/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17176169,336
631179,Survey of CAMHS clinicians about their experience of remote consultation: brief report,2021-01-13,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 wreaked havoc on the healthcare system, with more than 36 million cases reported globally. Although the pediatric population makes up a lesser proportion of total COVID-19 patients than adults, the clinical status, age and comorbidities warrant identifying possible prognostic factors associated with disease severity in this group. The current study aimed to explore the incidence of thrombosis, overall outcome, and different hematological and coagulation markers in children with COVID-19. METHODS: This is a single-center prospective study of 43 patients (age < 14 years) with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis recruited from April to August 2020. Data for clinical presentation were collected and analyzed. The samples were tested for different hematological and coagulation markers. RESULTS: Twenty-nine (67.4%) were symptomatic at presentation, with fever being the most common symptom (n = 23, 53.5%), followed by respiratory (n = 5, 11.6%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (n = 3, 7%). Co-morbid conditions were recorded in 26 (60.5%) patients, with malignancy being the commonest (n = 9, 20.9%). In this cohort of patients with age <14 years, hypertension, respiratory symptoms and ABO group-A were significantly associated with pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission during the course of treatment. Patients with elevated FVIII and fibrinogen levels at presentation were more likely to have an extended length of hospital stay (LOS) (P–value =0.036 and 0.032 respectively). No thrombotic event was observed in our cohort. D-dimer values were higher (above 0.5 µg/mL) in 24 (55.8%) patients at admission. We found an association between high D-dimer and PICU admission and LOS. CONCLUSION: Although we did not observe thrombosis in our cohort, serial measurements of D-dimer and elevated FVIII bear a prognostic value in predicting the need for critical care in children with COVID-19. Further studies with larger sample size can aid in the establishment of prognostic factors for the pediatric COVID-19 population.","Saleh, Mahasen; Alkofide, Amani; Alshammari, Anfal; Siddiqui, Khawar; Owaidah, Tarek",J Blood Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34512062/; https://doi.org/10.2147/jbm.s321372,336

From asymptomatic to symptomatic, the virus causes a wide spectrum of presentations. COVID-19 patients may present with oral manifestations. In Afghanistan, where COVID-19 has severely strained the health care system, much of the population lacks proper oral hygiene. This makes the oral cavity a perfect site for SARS-CoV-2 to manifest clinical signs. CASE PRESENTATION: A 62-year-old male was evaluated in the Dentistry Teaching Clinic of Kabul University of Medical Sciences for a painful erosive lesion on dorsal surface of his tongue. He also complained of fever, cough, and taste alteration. He was referred to Afghan Japan Hospital for COVID-19 testing and tested positive. He was followed on for the treatment of SARS-CoV2. After 2 weeks, the patient tested negative and returned to the dentistry clinic for follow-up. Although there were no other signs of COVID-19, the painful erosive lesion on his tongue persisted. Oral evaluation were performed and the patient was advised to practice good hygiene. After 10 days, we observed an asymptomatic geographic tongue without fever and myalgias and the lesion of dorsal surface of tongue improved from severe condition to moderate. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 should be screened for symptoms and physical findings in the oral mucosa To prevent such an outcome, awareness programs need to be implemented for the diagnosis and management of clinical symptoms among patients.","Nejabi, Mohammad Bashir; Noor, Noor Ahmad Shah; Raufi, Nahid; Essar, Mohammad Yasir; Ehsan, Ehsanullah; Shah, Jaffer; Shah, Asghar; Nemat, Arash",BMC Oral Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34016110/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12903-021-01635-8,336

While pulmonary findings are well-described in COVID-19, the implications of cardiovascular findings are less well understood. We evaluated the impact of cardiovascular findings on chest CT on the adverse composite outcome (ACO) of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: 245 COVID-19 patients who underwent chest CT at Rush University Health System were included. DESIGN: Cardiovascular findings, including coronary artery calcification (CAC), aortic calcification, signs of right ventricular strain [right ventricular to left ventricular diameter ratio, pulmonary artery to aorta diameter ratio, interventricular septal position, and inferior vena cava (IVC) reflux], were measured by trained physicians. INTERVENTIONS/MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: These findings, along with pulmonary findings, were analyzed using univariable logistic analysis to determine the risk of ACO defined as intensive care admission, need for non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, intubation, in-hospital and 60-day mortality. Secondary endpoints included individual components of the ACO. RESULTS: Aortic calcification was independently associated with an increased risk of the ACO (odds ratio 1.86, 95% confidence interval (1.11–3.17) p < 0.05). Aortic calcification, CAC, abnormal septal position, or IVC reflux of contrast were all significantly associated with 60-day mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events. IVC reflux was associated with in-hospital mortality (p = 0.005). CONCLUSION: Incidental cardiovascular findings on chest CT are clinically important imaging markers in COVID-19. It is important to ascertain and routinely report cardiovascular findings on CT imaging of COVID-19 patients as they have potential to identify high risk patients.","Planek, Maria Isabel Camara; Ruge, Max; Du Fay de Lavallaz, Jeanne M.; Kyung, Stella B.; Gomez, Joanne Michelle D.; Suboc, Tisha M.; Williams, Kim A.; Volgman, Annabelle Santos; Simmons, J.

633818,Abstract #1042704: Effectiveness of Teleconsultations Across Middle East And Africa (MENA) and India In T2DM To Deliver Continuity of Care During The COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-06-30,"BACKGROUND: Data monitoring of clinical trials is a tool aimed at reducing the risks of random errors (e.g. clerical errors) and systematic errors, which include misinterpretation, misunderstandings, and fabrication. Traditional ‘good clinical practice data monitoring’ with on-site monitors increases trial costs and is time consuming for the local investigators. This paper aims to outline our approach of time-effective central data monitoring for the SafeBoosC-III multicentre randomised clinical trial and present the results from the first three central data monitoring meetings. METHODS: The present approach to central data monitoring was implemented for the SafeBoosC-III trial, a large, pragmatic, multicentre, randomised clinical trial evaluating the benefits and harms of treatment based on cerebral oxygenation monitoring in preterm infants during the first days of life versus monitoring and treatment as usual. We aimed to optimise completeness and quality and to minimise deviations, thereby limiting random and systematic errors. We designed an automated report which was blinded to group allocation, to ease the work of data monitoring. The central data monitoring group first reviewed the data using summary plots only, and thereafter included the results of the multivariate Mahalanobis distance of each centre from the common mean. The decisions of the group were manually added to the reports for dissemination, information, correcting errors, preventing furture errors and documentation. RESULTS: The first three central monitoring meetings identified 156 entries of interest, decided upon contacting the local investigators for 146 of these, which resulted in correction of 53 entries. Multiple systematic errors and protocol violations were identified, one of these included 103/818 randomised participants. Accordingly, the electronic participant record form (ePRF) was improved to reduce ambiguity. DISCUSSION: We present a methodology for central data monitoring to optimise quality control and quality development. The initial results included identification of random errors in data entries leading to correction of the ePRF, systematic protocol violations, and potential protocol adherence issues. Central data monitoring may optimise concurrent data completeness and may help timely detection of data deviations due to misunderstandings or fabricated data.

An RT-PCR cocktail, which included Texas Red-labeled primers, dNTP including biotin-labeled dUTP, and RNA templates of influenza A H1N1 virus, was filled in the PCR chamber through the micropump, and the RT-PCR was performed to amplify the target H1 gene (102 bp). The resultant amplicons bearing biotin moieties and Texas Red haptens were subsequently eluted to the immunochromatographic strip, in which they were first conjugated with the gold nanoparticle labeled anti-hapten antibody in the conjugation pad, and then captured on the streptavidin coated test line through the biotin–streptavidin interaction. By observing a violet color in the test line which was derived from the gold nanoparticle, we confirmed the H1N1 target virus. The entire process on the integrated microdevice consisting of a micropump, a 2 μL PCR chamber, and an immunochromatographic strip was carried out on the portable genetic analyzer within 2.5 h, enabling on-site colorimetric pathogen identification with detection sensitivity of 14.1 pg RNA templates.","Kim, Yong Tae; Chen, Yuchao; Choi, Jong Young; Kim, Won-Jung; Dae, Hyun-Mi; Jung, Jaean; Seo, Tae Seok",Biosens Bioelectron,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22265877/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0956566311008244; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956566311008244; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2011.12.024,336

Vaccine candidates based on recombinant protein subunits remain important because they can be manufactured at low costs in existing large-scale production facilities that use microbial hosts like Komagataella phaffii (Pichia pastoris). Here, we report an improved and scalable manufacturing approach for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD); this protein is a key antigen for several reported vaccine candidates. We genetically engineered a manufacturing strain of K. phaffii to obviate the requirement for methanol-induction of the recombinant gene. Methanol-free production improved the secreted titer of the RBD protein by >5x by alleviating protein folding stress. Removal of methanol from the production process enabled scale up to a 1,200 L pre-existing production facility. This engineered strain is now used to produce an RBD-based vaccine antigen that is currently in clinical trials and could be used to produce other variants of RBD as needed for future vaccines.","Dalvie, Neil C.; Biedermann, Andrew M.; Rodriguez-Aponte, Sergio A.; Naranjo, Christopher A.; Rao, Harish D.; Rajurkar, Meghraj P.; Lothe, Rakesh R.; Shaligram, Umesh S.; Johnston, Ryan S.; Crowell, Laura E.; Castelino, Seraphin; Tracey, Mary Kate; Whittaker, Charles A.; Love, J.

Site One was PEDV positive; Site Two was PEDV negative. On Site One, pen samples (feces and oral fluids) and pig samples (rectal swabs and sera) were collected both before and after the population was exposed to PEDV. RESULTS: On Site Two, pen oral fluid samples and individual pig serum samples were negative for both PEDV antibody and nucleic acid. On Site One, PEDV was detected by rRT-PCR at 6 days post exposure (DPE) in all sample types. The last rRT-PCR positives were detected in rectal swabs and oral fluids on 69 DPE. IgG and IgA were detected in oral fluids and serum samples by 13 DPE. Analysis of the PEDV serum IgG WV ELISA data showed that a sample-to-positive (S/P) cutoff of ≥ 0.80 provided a diagnostic sensitivity of 0.87 (95 % CI: 0.82, 0.91) and specificity of 0.99 (95 % CI: 0.98, 1.00). Serum IgG results declined slowly over the monitoring period, with 60 % of serum samples positive (S/P ≥ 0.80) at the final sampling on 111 DPE. Analysis of the PEDV oral fluid IgA WV ELISA found that a cutoff of S/P ≥ 0.80 provided a diagnostic sensitivity of 1.00 (95 % CI: 0.92, 1.00) and a diagnostic specificity of 1.00 (95 % CI: 0.99, 1.00). The oral fluid IgA response increased through 96 DPE and began to decline at the last sampling on 111 DPE.

637098,Sleep patterns among Norwegian nurses between the first and second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic,2021-06-21,"Objectives One-fifth of Covid-19 patients suffer a severely symptomatic, hyperinflammatory course, but specific causes remain unclear. Mast cells (MCs) are activated by SARS-CoV-2. Though only recently recognized, MC activation syndrome (MCAS), usually due to acquired MC clonality, is a chronic multisystem disorder with inflammatory and allergic themes and estimated prevalence of 17%. We describe a novel conjecture explaining how MCAS might cause propensity for severe acute Covid-19 infection and chronic post-Covid-19 illnesses. Methods Observations of Covid-19 illness in patients with/without MCAS, set against our extensive clinical experience with MCAS. Results The prevalence of MCAS is concordant with the prevalence of severe cases within the Covid-19-infected population. Much of Covid-19’s hyperinflammation is concordant with manners of inflammation which MC activation can drive. Drugs with activity against MCs or their mediators have been preliminarily observed helpful in Covid-19 patients. None of our treated MCAS patients who have endured Covid-19 infection have suffered severe courses of the infection, let alone mortality. Conclusions Hyperinflammatory cytokine storms in many severely symptomatic Covid-19 patients may be rooted in aberrant response to SARS-CoV-2 by the dysfunctional MCs of MCAS rather than normal response by normal MCs. If provable, our conjecture has significant therapeutic and prognostic implications.","Afrin, Lawrence B.; Weinstock, Leonard B.; Molderings, Gerhard J.",Int J Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32920235/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220307323?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971220307323; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.09.016,336

It contends that properly understanding the ethical dimensions of such uses of fear depends in part on a clear understanding of the dynamics of disorientation that can be involved in such uses. Section two begins with a clarification of the connections between fear, orientation, and disorientation. It suggests that experiences of fear are in some cases either orienting or disorienting, and that the disorienting aspects of fear are in need of more attention. Section three shows how experiences of fear can be tools—they can be cultivated and wielded by agents deliberately for multiple reasons, including sometimes in order to disorient or re-orient others. Section four turns to a moral evaluation of these uses of fear, attending specifically to why the dynamics of disorientation and orientation often involved in experiences of fear are important for understanding the moral status of uses of fear.","Harbin, Ami",Ethical Theory Moral Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32837255/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10677-020-10103-1,336

We assessed the perceptions of healthcare workers on the current global IPC preparedness measures for COVID-19. Methods A cross-sectional survey using an electronic survey was circulated between February 26, 2020, and March 20, 2020, to IPC professionals during COVID-19 pandemic. The survey addressed the presence of COVID-19 guidelines as well as specific IPC preparedness activities in response to the outbreak. Findings In total, 339 IPC professionals spanning 63 countries in all 6 World Health Organization (WHO) regions, mostly from tertiary care centres participated. Of all participants, 66{middle dot}6% were aware of the existence of national guidelines to prevent COVID-19. A shortage of PPE supplies was reported by 48% (ranging from 64{middle dot}2% in low-income countries to 27{middle dot}4% in high-income countries); 41{middle dot}5% of respondents considered that the media had an impact on guideline development and 63{middle dot}6% believed that guidelines were based on maximum security rather than on evidence-based analyses. 58{middle dot}5% and 72{middle dot}7% of participants believed that healthcare facilities and community settings respectively were not sufficiently prepared. Conclusion Results revealed lack of guidelines and concerns over insufficient PPE supply in both high- and low-income countries. Our findings should alert national health authorities to ramp up the implementation of IPC measures and focus on long-term preparedness and readiness for future pandemics, likely requiring government funds rather than reliance on healthcare institutions.","TARTARI, E.; Hopman, J.; Allegranzi, B.; Gao, B.; Widmer, A.; Cheng, V.

However, evidence is scarce regarding the efficacy of adjuvant corticosteroids in patients who are critically ill. We retrospectively evaluated the effects of adjuvant corticosteroid treatment on the outcome of 244 critically ill patients with COVID-19, using a risk stratification model that adjusts for potential differences between the steroid group (n=151) and the non-steroid group (n=93). We observed that adjuvant corticosteroid therapy was independent from 28-day mortality, either in multivariate logistic regression of the entire cohort after adjustment for major mortality-associated variables (age, SpO2/FiO2, and lymphocyte count) and individual propensity score (adjusted OR: 1.05; 95% CI: -1.92-2.01), or in propensity score-matched (1:1 without replacement) case-control analysis (62 patients in 31 pairs; log-rank test P=0.17). Additionally, subgroup analyses of 147 (60%) patients who had dyspnea and 87 (36%) patients who had ARDS revealed corticosteroid treatment was not associated with clinical outcome (both, P>0.3). However, increased corticosteroids dosage was significantly associated with elevated mortality risk after adjustment for administration duration (P=0.003); every ten-milligram increase in hydrocortisone-equivalent dosage was associated with additional 4% mortality risk (adjusted HR: 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01-1.07).

DESIGN: Rapid review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed/Medline, PsycInfo, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, and Google Scholar, searched up to late March 2020. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR STUDY SELECTION: Any study that described the psychological reactions of healthcare staff working with patients in an outbreak of any emerging virus in any clinical setting, irrespective of any comparison with other clinicians or the general population. RESULTS: 59 papers met the inclusion criteria: 37 were of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), eight of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), seven of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), three each of Ebola virus disease and influenza A virus subtype H1N1, and one of influenza A virus subtype H7N9. Of the 38 studies that compared psychological outcomes of healthcare workers in direct contact with affected patients, 25 contained data that could be combined in a pairwise meta-analysis comparing healthcare workers at high and low risk of exposure. Compared with lower risk controls, staff in contact with affected patients had greater levels of both acute or post-traumatic stress (odds ratio 1.71, 95% confidence interval 1.28 to 2.29) and psychological distress (1.74, 1.50 to 2.03), with similar results for continuous outcomes. These findings were the same as in the other studies not included in the meta-analysis. Risk factors for psychological distress included being younger, being more junior, being the parents of dependent children, or having an infected family member. Longer quarantine, lack of practical support, and stigma also contributed. Clear communication, access to adequate personal protection, adequate rest, and both practical and psychological support were associated with reduced morbidity. CONCLUSIONS: Effective interventions are available to help mitigate the psychological distress experienced by staff caring for patients in an emerging disease outbreak. These interventions were similar despite the wide range of settings and types of outbreaks covered in this review, and thus could be applicable to the current covid-19 outbreak.","Kisely, Steve; Warren, Nicola; McMahon, Laura; Dalais, Christine; Henry, Irene; Siskind, Dan",BMJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32371466/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.m1642,336

639003,Comments on psychological impact of COVID-19 lockdown: An online survey from India,2020-10-10,"BACKGROUND: Many new variants of SARS-CoV-2 have been termed Variants of Concern/Interest (VOC/I) because of their greater risk due to possibly: enhanced transmissibility and/or severity, immune escape, diagnostic and/or treatment failure, and reduced vaccine efficacy. OBJECTIVES: We sought to review current knowledge of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, particularly those deemed VOC/Is: B.1.351, B.1.1.7, and P.1. SOURCES: MEDLINE and BioRxiv databases, as well as the grey literature were searched for reports of SARS-CoV-2 variants since November 2020. Relevant articles and their references were screened. CONTENT: Mutations on the spike protein in particular may affect both affinity for the SARS-CoV-2 cell receptor ACEII or antibody binding. These VOC/Is often share similar mutation sets. The N501Y mutation is shared by the main three VOCs: B.1.1.7, first identified in the United Kingdom; P.1, originating from Brazil; and B.1.351, first described in South Africa. This mutation likely increases transmissibility, by increasing affinity for ACEII. The B.1.351 and P.1 variants also display the E484K mutation, which decreases binding of neutralizing antibodies, leading to partial immune escape, favoring reinfections, and decreased in vitro efficacy of some antibody therapies or vaccines. Those mutations may also have phenotypical repercussions of higher severity. Furthermore, the accumulation of mutations poses a diagnostic risk (lowered when using multiplex assays), as seen for some assays targeting the S-gene. With ongoing surveillance, many new VOC/Is have been identified. The emergence of the E484K mutation independently in different parts of the globe may reflect adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to humans in a background of increasing immunity. IMPLICATIONS: These VOC/Is are increasing in frequency globally and pose challenges to any herd immunity approach of managing the pandemic. While vaccination is ongoing, vaccine updates may be prudent. The virus continues to adapt to transmission in humans, and further divergence from the initial Wuhan sequences is expected.","Boehm, Erik; Kronig, Ilona; Neher, Richard A.; Eckerle, Isabella; Vetter, Pauline; Kaiser, Laurent",Clin Microbiol Infect,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X21002627; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X21002627?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34015535/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2021.05.022,336

This study aimed to evaluate the clinical utility of an antigen test by evaluating the time period to get positive results and by comparing the test sensitivity with that of a digital immunoassay (DIA) test. We prospectively collected additional nasopharyngeal samples from patients who had already tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription PCR. The additional swab was used for an antigen test, QuickNavi-COVID19 Ag, and the time periods to get positive results were measured. The sensitivity of QuickNavi-COVID19 Ag was also compared with that of a DIA. In 84 of 96 (87.5%) analyzed cases, the results of QuickNavi-COVID19 Ag were positive. The time to obtain positive results was 15.0 seconds in median (inter quartile range: 12.0-33.3, range 11-736), and was extended in samples with higher cycle thresholds (Ct) (p<0.001). Positive lines appeared within a minute in 85.7% of cases and within 5 minutes in 96.4%. The sensitivities of QuickNavi-COVID19 Ag and the DIA were 87.5% (95% confident interval [CI]: 79.2%-93.4%) and 88.6% (95%CI: 75.4%-96.2%), respectively. Their results were concordant in 90.9% of cases, with discrepancies present only in cases with Ct values >32. QuickNavi-COVID19 Ag immediately showed positive results in most cases, and the time to a positive reaction may have indicated the viral load. In addition, the sensitivity of the test was comparable to the DIA.","Akashi, Y.; Kiyasu, Y.; Takeuchi, Y.; Kato, D.; Kuwahara, M.; Muramatsu, S.; Ueda, A.; Notake, S.; Nakamura, K.; Ishikawa, H.; Suzuki, H.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.09.21258157; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.09.21258157v1?rss=1,336
639175,"Correction to: At the US Epicenter of the COVID-19 Pandemic, an Orthopedic Residency Program Reorganizes",2020-09-15,"Misinformation such as on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) drugs, vaccination or presentation of its treatment from untrusted sources have shown dramatic consequences on public health. Authorities have deployed several surveillance tools to detect and slow down the rapid misinformation spread online. Large quantities of unverified information are available online and at present there is no real-time tool available to alert a user about false information during online health inquiries over a web search engine. To bridge this gap, we propose a web search engine misinformation notifier extension (SEMiNExt). Natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithm have been successfully integrated into the extension. This enables SEMiNExt to read the user query from the search bar, classify the veracity of the query and notify the authenticity of the query to the user, all in real-time to prevent the spread of misinformation. Our results show that SEMiNExt under artificial neural network (ANN) works best with an accuracy of 93%, F1-score of 92%, precision of 92% and a recall of 93% when 80% of the data is trained. Moreover, ANN is able to predict with a very high accuracy even for a small training data size. This is very important for an early detection of new misinformation from a small data sample available online that can significantly reduce the spread of misinformation and maximize public health safety. The SEMiNExt approach has introduced the possibility to improve online health management system by showing misinformation notifications in real-time, enabling safer web-based searching on health-related issues.","Shams, Abdullah Bin; Hoque Apu, Ehsanul; Rahman, Ashiqur; Sarker Raihan, Md.

At baseline, postintervention (1 month), and 2-month follow-up, participants completed self-reports of primary outcomes (anxiety and depression), secondary outcomes (mindfulness and social support), and emotional suppression as a culturally relevant mechanism of change. Feasibility and acceptability were also evaluated. Using intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis, linear mixed effects models showed that compared to social support mHealth, mindfulness mHealth had a superior effect on anxiety (p = .024, between-group d = 0.72). Both conditions improved on depression (baseline-to-FU ds > 1.10, between-group difference not significant, d = 0.36 favoring mindfulness). There was an interaction of Emotional suppression reduction × Condition in the improvement of anxiety and depression. Further, mindfulness mHealth was demonstrated to be more feasible and acceptable in program engagement, evaluation, skills improvement, and perceived benefit. Retention was high in both conditions (>80%). The difference in self-reported adverse effect was nonsignificant (3.9% in mindfulness and 8.7% in social support). Results of this pilot trial suggest that both mindfulness and social support, delivered via mHealth, show promise in reducing distress among young adults in quarantine, with mindfulness being particularly effective in addressing anxiety. Successful implementation and dissemination of this mHealth intervention approach have the potential for addressing the psychological consequences of the pandemic.

COVID-19 infection, mental stress and non-availability of drugs following lockdown may worsen myasthenic symptoms. We report the impact of COVID 19, and lockdown on the physical and mental health, and quality of sleep in a cohort of MG. METHODS: Thirty-eight MG patients were telephonically interviewed 2months after the declaration of lockdown in India. The difficulty in procuring drugs, complications, and worsening in the MG Foundation of America (MGFA) stage were noted. The patients were enquired about MG Quality of Life 15 (MGQOL15), MG Activity of Daily Living (MGADL), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) using a prefixed questionnaire. Their pre-COVID parameters were retrieved from our earlier trial data, which was completed 4months back. The scores of the above mentioned parameters before and after COVID were compared. RESULTS: Their median age was 45 years, and the median duration of treatment for MG was 4.5years. Eleven (28.9 %) patients were hypertensive and 3(7.9 %) diabetic. All were on prednisolone and 18(47.4 %) received azathioprine. None developed COVID, but three had other infections. Two patients needed hospitalization because of wrong medication in one and severe anxiety-insomnia in another. Following COVID19 and lockdown, MG patients had worsening in MGQOL15, MGADL, HADS and PSQI scores. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score correlated with MGQOL15 and dose of acetylcholine esterase inhibitors. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 and lockdown were associated with anxiety, depression, poor MGQOL and sleep especially in severe MG patients.","Kalita, Jayantee; Tripathi, Abhilasha; Dongre, Nikhil; Misra, Usha K.",Clin Neurol Neurosurg,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303846721000159?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clineuro.2021.106488; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33460984/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0303846721000159,336
639556,The safety of dental care for older adults during COVID-19 pandemic era,2021-10-03,"BACKGROUND: The situation caused by COVID-19 has led to movement restrictions for the majority of the population due to the confinement established by the health authorities. This new situation has changed people’s habits and significantly affected the pregnant population. Decreased exercise and increased psychophysical stress are associated with excessive weight gain, diabetes, and gestational cardiovascular complications that affect the mother, fetus, and newborn. Recent research shows that the dynamics of maternal blood pressure is one of the most important control factors during pregnancy. Thus, prevention of these type of pathologies through interventions without maternal-fetal risks is important. OBJECTIVES: To examine the influence of a virtual exercise program on maternal blood pressure during pregnancy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A randomized clinical trial design was used (NCT04563065). Data from 72 pregnant women without obstetric contraindications under confinement conditions in the Madrid area were collected. Women were randomly assigned to the intervention (IG) or control group (CG). They previously signed informed consent forms. A moderate exercise program was performed as an intervention from 8–10 to 38–39 weeks of pregnancy. Systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) maternal blood pressure were measured during the first, second and third trimesters of pregnancy, as well as before and immediately after delivery in both study groups. RESULTS: No differences in systolic and diastolic blood pressure during the first, second and third trimesters were found between groups. Significant differences in SBP were found immediately before delivery (IG = 119.83 ± 10.16 vs. CG = 125.6 ± 10.91; p = 0.047) and immediately after delivery (IG = 115.00 ± 11.18 vs. CG = 122.24 ± 15.71; p = 0.045). CONCLUSIONS: Results show lower SBP values for the IG during delivery than CG. A virtual exercise program throughout pregnancy during COVID-19 confinement can help to control systolic blood pressure before and immediately after delivery in healthy pregnant women.","Silva-Jose, Cristina; Sánchez-Polán, Miguel; Diaz-Blanco, Ángeles; Coterón, Javier; Barakat, Ruben; Refoyo, Ignacio",Front Physiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33776798/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2021.645136,336
639663,Linked electronic health records for research on a nationwide cohort of more than 54 million people in England: data resource,2021-04-07,"BACKGROUND: Vaccination is, without doubt, one of the most outstanding health interventions in reducing unprecedented damages of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Globally, several vaccines have been produced to be effective against COVID-19. This survey aimed to assess the demand and intent towards the COVID-19 vaccine among the general population in Ethiopia. Also, factors influencing their demand, intention, and willingness to pay for the COVID-19 vaccine were described, which is poorly understood in resource-limited settings. METHODS: Subjects were 1160 individuals who completed an online questionnaire from February to March 2021. The study used the health belief model (HBM) to evaluate participants’ intention to receive and willingness to pay (WTP) regarding the COVID-19 vaccine. Chi-square and binary logistic regression were conducted to identify the prevalence and associated factors of demand and WTP. Multinomial regression was done to examine the intent to receive a vaccine. RESULTS: In total 1116 responses were collected. The results indicated a moderate level of demand and WTP among participants (64.7% and 56.0%, respectively). Further, the researchers examined participants’ readiness towards COVID-19 vaccination, where 46.6% of participants had a definite intent, and close to half of the participants are unsure (32.8%) or unwilling (20.7%) to get vaccinated. Among other factors, items under perceived susceptibility and perceived benefits constructs in the HBM have been associated with participants’ demand, willingness to vaccinate, and WTP. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the usefulness of the HBM model in evaluating the demand, intention, and willingness of participants to pay for COVID-19. Improving public awareness of the vulnerability should be a major point of attention to reduce the barriers, and improve demand and intention for COVID-19. Moreover, public health messages should be tailored to enhance vaccine literacy.","Seboka, Binyam Tariku; Yehualashet, Delelegn Emwodew; Belay, Moges Mareg; Kabthymer, Robel Hussen; Ali, Helen; Hailegebreal, Samuel; Demeke, Abel Desalegn; Amede, Endris Seid; Tesfa, Getanew Aschalew",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,https://doi.org/10.2147/rmhp.s315043; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34234590/,336

During the early phase, little was known about public knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) relating to coronavirus disease. This study was designed to determine KAP of Iranians toward COVID-19. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was carried out in Iran from February 25 to April 25 using a self-administered questionnaire on 1,480 people. COVID-19-related KAP questions were adapted from other internationally validated questionnaires specific for infectious diseases. Results: All participants were aware of COVID-19. When asked unprompted, 80% of respondents could correctly cite fever, difficulty in breathing, and cough as signs/symptoms of COVID-19. Most of our sample population knew that staying at home and isolated (95.3%) as well as constant handwashing and using disinfectants (92.5%) could prevent COVID-19. However, there were also widespread misconceptions such as the belief that COVID-19 can be transmitted by wild animals (58%) and by air (48.3%). Unprompted, self-reported actions taken to avoid COVID-19 infection included handwashing with soap and water (95.4%), avoiding crowded places (93%), cleansing hands with other disinfectants (80.), and covering mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing (76.1%). The Internet and social media (94.5%) were the main coronavirus information sources. However, the most trusted information sources on coronavirus were health and medical professionals (79.3%). The majority of participants (77.0%) wanted more information about coronavirus to be available.

The objective of this research was to understand how the learning of pharmacy students at the University of Alberta was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was distributed to 397 pharmacy students in years one through three. Students responded to three short-answer reflection questions: (1) how has the COVID-19 pandemic situation affected your learning; (2) from a pharmacy and pharmacy school perspective, what have you learned since the COVID-19 pandemic began; and (3) from a personal perspective, what have you learned about yourself since the COVID-19 pandemic began? A thematic analysis was undertaken of students' responses to these reflection questions. RESULTS: A total of 53 students responded to the survey (response rate 13%). Two major themes were identified across all three reflection questions, with several subthemes: remote learning (learning environment, knowledge transfer, knowledge retention, assessment) and mental health (appreciation, stress, extroversion, motivation). Adaptability, routine, professional identity, and the role of the pharmacist were also identified as less prevalent themes. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacy students' responses led to the identification of several themes related to their learning given the changes brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. This increased understanding of student perceptions has the potential to improve the remote delivery of education, support increased university-wide mental health resourcing, and shape pharmacy curriculum development.","Nagy, Danielle K.; Hall, Jill J.; Charrois, Theresa L.",Curr Pharm Teach Learn,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1877129721002185; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877129721002185?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34521525/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cptl.2021.07.014,336

However, there is a plethora of technical options for practitioners to choose from, and there are various challenges in the adaptation of clinical processes as well as several special considerations regarding regulatory context and patient management. Practitioners are faced with a lack of high-quality peer-reviewed resources to guide the planning and practical implementation of remote consultations. OBJECTIVES: This Clinical Update seeks to provide practical guidance for the planning and implementation of remote consultations for the management and treatment of people with musculoskeletal pain. METHODS: Recommendations are based on a brief overview of the relevant research regarding phone and video consultations for musculoskeletal practice and derived from the literature, relevant guidelines, and practical experience. RESULTS: The technical feasibility of remote consultations for musculoskeletal complaints is good, patient satisfaction is high, and a growing body of evidence supports its comparative effectiveness to in-person consultations in some circumstances for improving pain and functioning. We consider in detail practical aspects such as the choosing of hardware and software, we touch on the legal and regulatory context, and we focus on the adaptation of clinical processes and communication. CONCLUSION: This Clinical Update draws together best-practice evidence in a practically applicable format, enabling therapists who are working with people with pain to directly apply this knowledge to their individual clinical settings and the requirements of their patients.","Hohenschurz-Schmidt, David; Scott, Whitney; Park, Charlie; Christopoulos, Georgios; Vogel, Steven; Draper-Rodi, Jerry",Pain Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33344873/; https://doi.org/10.1097/pr9.0000000000000878,336
643252,Treatment of eating disorders in adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic: a case series,2021-02-10,"Arsenic (As) is widely used in the modern industry, especially in the production of pesticides, herbicides, wood preservatives, and semiconductors. The sources of As such as contaminated water, air, soil, but also food, can cause serious human diseases. The complex mechanism of As toxicity in the human body is associated with the generation of free radicals and the induction of oxidative damage in the cell. One effective strategy in reducing the toxic effects of As is the usage of chelating agents, which provide the formation of inert chelator–metal complexes with their further excretion from the body. This review discusses different aspects of the use of metal chelators, alone or in combination, in the treatment of As poisoning. Consideration is given to the therapeutic effect of thiol chelators such as meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid, sodium 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonate, 2,3-dimercaptopropanol, penicillamine, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and other recent agents against As toxicity. The review also considers the possible role of flavonoids, trace elements, and herbal drugs as promising natural chelating and detoxifying agents.","Bjørklund, Geir; Oliinyk, Petro; Lysiuk, Roman; Rahaman, Md.

Experimental evidences suggest that such morphological changes are caused by the disruption of the microtubules composing the cytoskeleton of the axon. In this paper, we develop a mathematical model of damaged axons based on the theory of continuum mechanics and nonlinear elasticity. The axon is described as a cylinder composed of an inner passive part, called axoplasm, and an outer active cortex, composed mainly of F-actin and able to contract thanks to myosin-II motors. Through a linear stability analysis we show that, as the shear modulus of the axoplasm diminishes due to the disruption of the cytoskeleton, the active contraction of the cortex makes the cylindrical configuration unstable to axisymmetric perturbations, leading to a beading pattern. Finally, the non-linear evolution of the bifurcated branches is investigated through finite element simulations.","Riccobelli, Davide",Physical review.

There is conflicting evidence regarding the effectiveness of routinely used mouthwashes and especially Chlorhexidine, to reduce the viral load in oral cavity and the aerosols during oral procedures. AIMS: Comparative evaluation of the effectiveness of the current 'gold standard' chlorhexidine and povidone iodine as a control agent, through an in-vitro analysis. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: In-vitro laboratory analysis. METHODS AND MATERIAL: All the experiments for analysis of antiviral efficacy of chlorhexidine digluconate (2%)and povidone iodine(1%), against SARS-CoV-2 virus were performed in the BSL3 facility at the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research-Institute of Microbial Technology, using the VeroE6 cell lines. The analysis of the virus inactivation was based on quantification of viral RNA (Cycle threshold (Ct) profile) present in the culture supernatant using Real-Time Quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Descriptive analysis (Statistical package for social sciences (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, version 15.0 for Windows). RESULTS: Chlorhexidine digluconate in 0.2% concentration inactivated more than 99.9% of SARS CoV 2 virus, in minimal contact time of 30 seconds, which was considered better efficacy than povidone-iodine utilized for 30 and 60 seconds. Subtle differences were observed in the activity of both the compounds in terms of percent inactivation of virus, though a greater relative change in Ct values was observed for chlorhexidine. CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of the present study, it can be concluded that Chlorhexidine digluconate in 0.2% concentration inactivated SARS CoV 2 in minimal contact time i.e 30 secs, however both compounds tested i.e Chlorhexidine and povidone-iodine were found to have antiviral activity against SARS CoV2 virus.","Jain, Ashish; Grover, Vishakha; Singh, Charandeep; Sharma, Anshul; Das, Deepjyoti Kumar; Singh, Prashant; Thakur, Krishan Gopal; Ringe, Rajesh P.",J Indian Soc Periodontol,https://doi.org/10.4103/jisp.jisp_824_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33642749/,336

While limiting super-spreading promotes more effective control when cases are growing, we find that when incidence is waning, curbing sub-spreading is more important for achieving reliable elimination of the epidemic. Controlling super-spreading in this low-transmissibility phase offers diminishing returns over non-selective, population-wide measures. By restricting sub-spreading, we efficiently dampen remaining variations among the reproduction numbers of infectious events, which minimizes the risk of premature and late end-of-epidemic declarations. Because case-ascertainment or reporting rates can be modelled in exactly the same way as control policies, we concurrently show that the under-reporting of sub-spreading events during waning phases will engender overconfident assessments of epidemic elimination. While controlling sub-spreading may not be easily realized, the likely neglecting of these events by surveillance systems could result in unexpectedly risky end-of-epidemic declarations. Super-spreading controls the size of the epidemic peak but sub-spreading mediates the variability of its tail.","Parag, Kris V.","Journal of the Royal Society, Interface",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34404230/; https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2021.0444,336

However, recent studies show evidence of complex relationships between RUNX proteins, chromatin-modifying machinery, the cytoskeleton and different transcription factors in various non-embryonic contexts, including mature T cell homeostasis, inflammation and cancer. In this review, we discuss the diversity of Runx functions in mature T helper cells, such as production of cytokines and chemokines by different CD4 T cell populations; apoptosis; and immunologic memory acquisition.

We examined whether dysfunctional grief symptoms, disrupted meaning, risk factors, and functional impairment differed between people bereaved from COVID-19 and from other natural or violent causes in this same period. A sample of 409 participants (67.73% male; M = 37.54 years) completed an online survey in June 2021. There were no statistically significant differences between the three groups on any of the outcome variables; all three groups manifested clinical levels of functional impairment equal to or greater than bereaved groups diagnosed with complicated or prolonged grief disorder prior to the pandemic. Disrupted meaning partially mediated the relationship between risk factors on the one hand and functional impairment and dysfunctional grief symptoms on the other. Findings indicate that deaths during COVID-19, rather than deaths from COVID-19, may precipitate symptoms of significant clinical concern.","Breen, Lauren J; Mancini, Vincent O; Lee, Sherman A; Pappalardo, Emily A; Neimeyer, Robert A",Death Stud,https://doi.org/10.1080/07481187.2021.1974666; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34514956/,336

The mass concentration and chemical composition of non‐refractory submicron particulate matter (NR‐PM(1)) were determined by a high‐resolution aerosol mass spectrometer during January‐March 2020. The concentration of NR‐PM(1) dropped by 50% from before to during control period. The five aerosol components (sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, chloride, and organic aerosol [OA]) all decreased during the control period with the biggest decrease observed for secondary inorganic species (70% of the total reduction). Though the mass concentration of OA decreased during the control period, its source emissions varied differently. OA from coal and biomass burning remained stable from before to during control period, while traffic and cooking related emissions were reduced by 25% and 50%, respectively. The low concentration during the control period was attributed to the lower production rate for secondary aerosols.","Xu, Jianzhong; Ge, Xinlei; Zhang, Xinghua; Zhao, Wenhui; Zhang, Ruixiong; Zhang, Yuzhong",Geophys Res Lett,https://doi.org/10.1029/2020gl089035; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33041387/,336

The upgrading of the urban food consumption structure not only puts forward higher food production requirements, but also poses a challenge to resource consumption and technological innovation. Considerable case or review studies have been conducted on UFS, but there is no bibliometric review attempting to provide an objective and comprehensive analysis of the existing articles. In this study, we selected 5360 research publications from the core Web of Science collection from 1991 to 2020, analyzing contributions of countries, institutions, and journals. In addition, based on keyword co-occurrence and clustering analyses, we evaluated the research hotspots of UFS. The results show that global research interest in UFS has increased significantly during these three decades. The USA, China, and the UK are the countries with the highest output and closest collaborations. UFS research involves multiple subject categories, with environmental disciplines becoming mainstream.

In addition to SARS, the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (AIV), H5N1, and the lower pathogenicity H9N2 AIV have expanded their host ranges to infect human beings and other mammalian species as well as birds. Even the ‘well-known’ reservoir animals for influenza virus, migratory birds, became victims of the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus. Not only the viruses, but bacteria can also expand their host range: a new disease, streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, caused by human Streptococcus suis serotype 2 infection, has been observed in China with 52 human fatalities in two separate outbreaks (1998 and 2005, respectively). Additionally, enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 infection has increased worldwide with severe disease. Several outbreaks and sporadic isolations of this pathogen in China have made it an important target for disease control. A new highly pathogenic variant of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) has been isolated in both China and Vietnam recently; although PRRSV is not a zoonotic human pathogen, its severe outbreaks have implications for food safety. All of these pathogens occur in Southeast Asia, including China, with severe consequences; therefore, we discuss the issues in this article by addressing the situation of the zoonotic threat in China.","Ma, Ying; Feng, Youjun; Liu, Di; Gao, George F.",Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19687041/; https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2009.0093; https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rstb.2009.0093,336

PURPOSE: The current evidence regarding iodine-containing compounds and iodine allergy cross-reactivity is reviewed. SUMMARY: Iodine is an essential human nutrient found in the thyroid gland. It is used in the synthesis of the thyroid hormones thyroxine and triiodothyroxine. Patients who report having adverse reactions to iodine-containing substances are often labelled as having an “iodine allergy,” which can result in delays in care or patients being denied essential ICM or other iodine-containing drugs. A literature review was conducted to evaluate the evidence regarding iodine allergy and iodine-containing drugs. Of 435 articles considered potentially appropriate for full review (plus 12 additional articles included on the basis of references from the eligible articles), 113 could not be obtained. After exclusion of 353 articles that did not meet all inclusion criteria, the remaining 81 articles were included in the review. The results of the literature review indicated that iodine has not been shown to be the allergen responsible for allergic reactions to iodinated contrast media, amiodarone, povidone-iodine, and other iodine-containing compounds. CONCLUSION: There is a lack of evidence to support cross-reactivity between iodine-containing compounds in so called iodine-allergic individuals.","Wulf, Nicole R; Schmitz, John; Choi, Amy",Am J Health Syst Pharm,https://doi.org/10.1093/ajhp/zxab033; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33547463/,336

Manifestations of this disease are heterogeneous; however, advanced cases often exhibit various acute respiratory distress syndrome-like symptoms, systemic inflammatory reactions, coagulopathy, and organ involvements. A common theme in advanced COVID-19 is unrestrained immune activation, classically referred to as a “cytokine storm”, as well as deficiencies in immune regulatory mechanisms such as T regulatory cells. While mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) themselves are objects of cytokine regulation, they can secrete cytokines to modulate immune cells by inducing anti-inflammatory regulatory Treg cells, macrophages and neutrophils; and by reducing the activation of T and B cells, dendritic and nature killer cells. Consequently, they have therapeutic potential for treating severe cases of COVID-19. Here we discuss the unique ability of MSCs, to act as a “living anti-inflammatory”, which can “rebalance” the cytokine/immune responses to restore equilibrium. We also discuss current MSC trials and present different concepts for optimization of MSC therapy in patients with COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome.","Lin, Feng; Ichim, Thomas E; Pingle, Sandeep; Jones, Lawrence D; Kesari, Santosh; Ashili, Shashaanka",World J Stem Cells,https://doi.org/10.4252/wjsc.v12.i10.1067; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33178392/,336

Thus, seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2 was 5.8%; nasopharyngeal swab was negative in all the cases. Considering the current limitations in sensitivity of nasopharyngeal swab, the uncertainty in the natural history of SARS-CoV2, and the reported prevalence of CoV-2, we think that careful preadmission triage and tests, the use of personal protective equipment and safe management of surgical smoke are mandatory also in our context of low CoV-2 incidence area.","Medas, Fabio; Cappellacci, Federico; Anedda, Giacomo; Canu, Gian Luigi; Del Giacco, Stefano; Calò, Pietro Giorgio; Firinu, Davide",Ann Med Surg (Lond),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33163178/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2049080120304325; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2049080120304325?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2020.11.006,336
648991,Epidemiological trends in notified syphilis diagnoses during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil,2021,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has implied worldwide the imposition of confinement measures and mobility restrictions, to a greater or lesser extent. It has also meant the closure of some public medical services such as reproductive care. This situation may have impacted the health-related behaviour and quality of life of women with fertility problems. Objective: The objective of this study was to analyse the effects of confinement and the suspension of reproductive medical care on the lifestyle (diet, physical exercise, and smoking habits), anxiety and depression, and quality of life of infertile women by comparing their pre- and post-confinement situations. Methods: We carried out a cross-sectional, internet-based study. Information was collected on these women's adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MEDAS questionnaire), physical exercise (IPAQ-SF), anxiety and depression (HADS), and quality of life related to fertility (FertiQol) before, during, and after confinement. The survey was conducted between 1 September and 28 October 2020. Results: A total of 85 women participated. There had been a significant increase in anxiety and depression levels (P < 0.001) and an increase in tobacco consumption among female smokers during confinement vs. pre-confinement (62.5% had increased their consumption). The participants had also increased the mean number of hours they spent sitting (P < 0.001). There had also been an increase in vigorous and moderate exercise levels by 40 and 30%, respectively (P = 0.004). However, no differences were observed in these patients' eating habits as a result of confinement (P = 0.416). When the reproduction service was resumed, the participants showed higher anxiety level scores (P = 0.001) with respect to the pre-confinement situation as well as lower mean FertiQol scale score (P = 0.008). Conclusions: Confinement had increased anxiety and depression levels among these infertile women as well as tobacco use among the participants who were smokers. The prolonged closure of reproductive care units decreased the quality of life of the participants of this study. These results suggest the need to implement online programs to improve healthy habits and quality of life of this population group.","Biviá-Roig, Gemma; Boldó-Roda, Ana; Blasco-Sanz, Ruth; Serrano-Raya, Lola; DelaFuente-Díez, Elena; Múzquiz-Barberá, Pedro; Lisón, Juan Francisco",Front Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.686115; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34350151/,336

We assessed the safety and efficacy of baloxavir in otherwise healthy children with acute influenza. METHODS: MiniSTONE-2 (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT03629184) was a double-blind, randomized, active controlled trial enrolling children 1–<12 years old with a clinical diagnosis of influenza. Children were randomized 2:1 to receive either a single dose of oral baloxavir or oral oseltamivir twice daily for 5 days. The primary endpoint was incidence, severity and timing of adverse events (AEs); efficacy was a secondary endpoint. RESULTS: In total, 173 children were randomized and dosed, 115 to the baloxavir group and 58 to the oseltamivir group. Characteristics of participants were similar between treatment groups. Overall, 122 AEs were reported in 84 (48.6%) children. Incidence of AEs was similar between baloxavir and oseltamivir groups (46.1% vs. 53.4%, respectively). The most common AEs were gastrointestinal (vomiting/diarrhea) in both groups [baloxavir: 12 children (10.4%); oseltamivir: 10 children (17.2%)]. No deaths, serious AEs or hospitalizations were reported. Median time (95% confidence interval) to alleviation of signs and symptoms of influenza was similar between groups: 138.1 (116.6–163.2) hours with baloxavir versus 150.0 (115.0–165.7) hours with oseltamivir. CONCLUSIONS: Oral baloxavir is well tolerated and effective at alleviating symptoms in otherwise healthy children with acute influenza.

Evidence from animal experiments suggests this approach is safe and effective. We are preparing to initiate a first-in-human clinical study of hiPSC-NS/PC transplantation in subacute SCI. SETTING: NS/PCs were prepared at a Good Manufacturing Practice-grade cell processing facility at Osaka National Hospital using a clinical-grade integration-free hiPSC line established by the iPSC Stock Project organized by the Kyoto University Center for iPS Cell Research and Application. After performing all quality checks, the long-term safety and efficacy of cells were confirmed using immunodeficient mouse models. METHODS: The forthcoming clinical study uses an open-label, single-arm design. The initial follow-up period is 1 year. The primary objective is to assess the safety of hiPSC-NS/PC transplantation in patients with subacute SCI. The secondary objective is to obtain preliminary evidence of its impact on neurological function and quality-of-life outcomes. Four patients with C3/4-Th10 level, complete subacute (within 24 days post-injury) SCI will be recruited. After obtaining consent, cryopreserved cells will be thawed and prepared following a multi-step process including treatment with a γ-secretase inhibitor to promote cell differentiation. A total of 2 × 10(6) cells will be transplanted into the injured spinal cord parenchyma 14–28 days post-injury. Patients will also receive transient immunosuppression.

Eleven potential ARIMA models were examined for VLH cases. Finally, the best model was selected with the lower Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) value. Then, the selected model was used to forecast frequency of monthly occurrences case. The forecasting precision was estimated by mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Data analysis was performed using Stata14 and its package time series analysis. RESULTS: ARIMA (5, 0, 1) model with AIC (25.7) and BIC (43.35) was selected. The MAPE value was 26.89% and the portmanteau test for white noise was (Q = 23.02, P = 0.98) for the residuals of the selected model showed that the data were fully modelled. The total cumulative VLH cases in the next 24 months’ in Ardabil province predicted 14 cases (95% CI: 4-54 case). CONCLUSION: The ARIMA (5, 0, 1) model can be a useful tool to predict VLH cases as early warning system and the results are helpful for policy makers and primary care physicians in the readiness of public health problems before the outbreak of the disease.","Rahmanian, Vahid; Bokaie, Saied; Haghdoost, Aliakbar; Barooni, Mohsen",J Family Med Prim Care,https://doi.org/10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_1542_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33681041/,336
653572,Anti-doping and other sport integrity challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) are highly contagious pathogens causing acute respiratory disease (ARD), among other illnesses. Of the ARD genotypes, HAdV-7 presents with more severe morbidity and higher mortality than the others. We report the isolation and identification of a genome type HAdV-7d (DG01_2011) from a recent outbreak in Southern China. Genome sequencing, phylogenetic analysis, and restriction endonuclease analysis (REA) comparisons with past pathogens indicate HAdV-7d has re-emerged in Southern China after an absence of twenty-one years. Recombination analysis reveals this genome differs from the 1950s-era prototype and vaccine strains by a lateral gene transfer, substituting the coding region for the L1 52/55 kDa DNA packaging protein from HAdV-16. DG01_2011 descends from both a strain circulating in Southwestern China (2010) and a strain from Shaanxi causing a fatality and outbreak (Northwestern China; 2009). Due to the higher morbidity and mortality rates associated with HAdV-7, the surveillance, identification, and characterization of these strains in population-dense China by REA and/or whole genome sequencing are strongly indicated. With these accurate identifications of specific HAdV types and an epidemiological database of regional HAdV pathogens, along with the HAdV genome stability noted across time and space, the development, availability, and deployment of appropriate vaccines are needed.","Zhao, Suhui; Wan, Chengsong; Ke, Changwen; Seto, Jason; Dehghan, Shoaleh; Zou, Lirong; Zhou, Jie; Cheng, Zetao; Jing, Shuping; Zeng, Zhiwei; Zhang, Jing; Wan, Xuan; Wu, Xianbo; Zhao, Wei; Zhu, Li; Seto, Donald; Zhang, Qiwei",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/srep07365; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25482188/,336
653691,Physical activity during COVID‐19 quarantine,2020-06-18,"The COVID-19 pandemic placed pregnant women at high risk, but behavioural changes have also led to lower rates of preterm births in high-income countries. The main goal of this article is to study the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on pregnancy control and outcomes; this is a joint analysis of two cohorts. The pre-pandemic cohort includes 969 pregnant women recruited in 2018. The pandemic cohort comprises 1168 pregnant women recruited in 2020. Information on demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, reproductive history, characteristics of the current pregnancy and its outcome were obtained from medical records. Birth by Caesarean section was more frequent in the pre-pandemic cohort (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.55–0.92). A birth weight lower than 2500 g and higher than 4000 g occurred more frequently in the pre-pandemic cohort (adjusted OR = 0.62, 95% CI: 0.41–0.93 for lower than 2500 g and adjusted OR = 0.30, 95% CI: 0.20–0.46 for higher than 4000 g). Exclusive breastfeeding upon hospital discharge was more frequent in the pandemic cohort than in the pre-pandemic cohort (60% vs. 54%, p = 0.005), with adjusted OR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.52–0.86 for mixed breastfeeding and infant formula. In conclusion, we report reductions in Caesarean sections and reduced numbers of low birth weight babies during the pandemic in a hospital located in northern Spain. Further analysis will clarify if these reductions are related to changes in health-related behaviour or healthcare operation.","Llorca, Javier; Lechosa-Muñiz, Carolina; Frank de Zulueta, Pelayo; López-Gómez, Sonia; Orallo, Victoria; Alonso-Molero, Jéssica; Arozamena-Llano, Barbara; Jubete, Yolanda; Paz-Zulueta, María; Cabero, María J.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18158182; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34360483/,336

The activities of these cytokines have been studied extensively in vitro and in rodents, but in vivo studies on the role of these cytokines in infectious diseases of food animals are few. This review concentrates on in vivo studies of cytokine involvement in infectious respiratory diseases of swine, with an emphasis on viral infections. First evidence for the role of early cytokines in pneumonia in swine came from experimental infections with Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae. The role of TNF-α and IL-1 in the symptoms and pathology of porcine pleuropneumonia has recently been proven by use of an adenovirus vector expressing the anti-inflammatory IL-10. In the authors’ laboratory, studies were undertaken to investigate the relationship between viral respiratory disease and bioactive lung lavage levels of IFN-α, TNF-α, IL-1 and IL-6. Out of three respiratory viruses—porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and swine influenza virus (SIV)—only SIV induced acute respiratory disease and severe lung damage by itself. Disease and lung pathology were tightly associated with the simultaneous production of IFN-α, TNF-α, IL-1 and IL-6. In challenge studies of SIV-vaccinated pigs, levels of IFN-α, TNF-α and IL-6, but not IL-1 were correlated with clinical and virological protection. Multifactorial respiratory disease was reproduced by combined inoculations with PRCV or PRRSV followed by LPS from Escherichia coli. In comparison with the respective single inoculations, which were subclinical, there was a true potentiation of disease and production of TNF-α, IL-1 and IL-6. TNF-α and IL-6 were best correlated with disease. In further studies, we will use more specific strategies to dissect the role of cytokines during viral infections.","Van Reeth, Kristien; Van Gucht, Steven; Pensaert, Maurice",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242702000478; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12072230/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242702000478,336

The apelin–APJ receptor pathway has been implicated in HF, making it a promising therapeutic target. APJ has been shown to be activated by a novel endogenous peptide ligand known as Elabela (ELA, also called Toddler or Apela), with a critical role in cardiac development and function. Activation of the ELA–APJ receptor axis exerts a wide range of physiological effects, including depressor response, positive inotropic action, diuresis, anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, and anti-remodeling, leading to its cardiovascular protection. The ELA–APJ axis is essential for diverse biological processes and has been shown to regulate fluid homeostasis, myocardial contractility, vasodilation, angiogenesis, cellular differentiation, apoptosis, oxidative stress, cardiorenal fibrosis, and dysfunction. The beneficial effects of the ELA–APJ receptor system are well-established by treating hypertension, myocardial infarction, and HF. Additionally, administration of ELA protects human embryonic stem cells against apoptosis and stress-induced cell death and promotes survival and self-renewal in an APJ-independent manner (X receptor) via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway, which may provide a new therapeutic approach for HF. Thus, targeting the ELA–APJ axis has emerged as a pre-warning biomarker and a novel therapeutic approach against progression of HF. An increased understanding of cardiovascular actions of ELA will help to develop effective interventions. This article gives an overview of the characteristics of the ELA–apelin–APJ axis and summarizes the current knowledge on its cardioprotective roles, potential mechanisms, and prospective application for acute and chronic HF.","Ma, Zheng; Song, Juan-Juan; Martin, Sara; Yang, Xin-Chun; Zhong, Jiu-Chang",Heart Fail Rev,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10741-020-09957-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32314083/,336

However, the impact on sociodemographic characteristics of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 has not been evaluated. The aim of this study was to describe the changes in sociodemographic characteristics of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 and to compare the transmission risk factors of COVID-19 before and during lockdown in France. METHODS: An observational retrospective study was conducted in a University Hospital in Paris, France. Data from patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in the Infectious Diseases Department between February 26 and May 11, 2020 were collected. The study population was divided into 2 groups: group A of patients infected before lockdown, and group B of patients infected during lockdown, considering a maximum incubation period of 14 days. Sociodemographic characteristics and transmission risk factors were compared between the 2 groups using Student’s t-test for continuous variables and Chi-2 test or Fisher exact test for categorical variables. RESULTS: Three hundred eighty-three patients were included in the study, 305 (79.6%) in group A and 78 (20.4%) in group B. Patients in group A were significantly younger (60.0 versus (vs) 66.5 years (p = 0.03)). The professionally active population was larger in group A (44.3% vs 24.4%). There were significantly more non-French-speaking people in group B (16.7% vs 6.6%, p < 0.01). Most patients from group A had individual accommodation (92.8% vs 74.4%, p < 0.01). Contact with a relative was the main transmission risk factor in both groups (24.6% vs 33.3%, p = 0.16). Recent travel and large gathering were found only in group A. The proportion of people living in disadvantaged conditions, such as homeless people or people living in social housing, was significantly higher in group B (11.5% vs 4.3%, p = 0.03) as was the proportion of institutionalized individuals (14.1% vs 3.0%, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In this study conducted in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in Paris, France, the likelihood of being infected despite the lockdown was higher for people who do not speak French, live in social housing, are homeless or institutionalized. Targeted measures have to be implemented to protect these populations.","Rahi, Mayda; Le Pluart, Diane; Beaudet, Alexandra; Ismaël, Sophie; Parisey, Marion; Poey, Nora; Tarhini, Hassan; Lescure, François-Xavier; Yazdanpanah, Yazdan; Deconinck, Laurène",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34388990/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-021-06419-7,336

Severe COVID-19 disease is associated with disordered inflammatory responses. We hypothesized that reduced plasma RNLS levels could be a marker of COVID-19 disease severity. Methods: Plasma was collected from 51 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and 15 uninfected non-hospitalized controls. Plasma RNLS and cytokine levels were measured and sociodemographic and clinical data were collected from chart review. Data were analyzed using nonparametric analyses and Kaplan Meir curve log rank analysis. Results: Plasma RNLs levels were negatively correlated with inflammatory markers, including IL-1b, IL-6, and TNFa (p = 0.04, p = 0.03, p = 0.01, respectively). Patients with COVID-19 disease had lower levels of RNLS than controls. Lower levels of RNLS were associated with more severe disease among COVID-19 patients. Low RNLS was also associated with worse survival among COVID-19 patients (HR = 4.54; 95% CI: 1.06-19.43; p = 0.005). Conclusion: Low plasma RNLS levels are associated with severe COVID-19 disease and may be a useful additional biomarker when identifying patients with severe COVID-19 disease. Given RNLS anti-inflammatory properties and negative correlation with inflammatory markers, these findings also suggest evidence of a potential pathophysiological mechanism for severe COVID-19 disease.","Wang, M.; Guo, X.; Chun, H.

Counterbalance between angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) and ACE2 activities in COVID-19 disease may be crucially involved in the thrombo-inflammatory process. Currently, no study has investigated ACE I/D polymorphism involvement in COVID-19 disease complicated by pulmonary embolism, hence the aim of the present pilot study. This is a retrospective, single-center observational case-control study, conducted at the Sub-Intensive Care Unit of A.O.R.N. Ospedali dei Colli, Cotugno Hospital, Naples (Italy). We included 68 subjects with severe/critical COVID-19 pneumonia. COVID-19 patients were divided according to occurrence of PE (PE+, n = 25) or absence of thromboembolic complications (PE−, n = 43). Assessment of ACE I/D polymorphisms showed a statistically significant difference between PE+ and PE− patients (p = 0.029). Particularly, prevalence of D/D homozygous polymorphism was significantly higher in PE+ COVID-19 patients than in PE− (72 vs. 46.5%; p = 0.048), while heterozygote I/D polymorphism was significantly lower expressed in PE+ patients than in PE− (16 vs. 48.8%; p = 0.009). Computed tomographic pulmonary angiography showed predominantly mono/bilateral sub-segmental embolisms. In conclusion, our findings let us hypothesize a genetic susceptibility to thromboembolism in COVID-19 disease.

656675,Perceived stress and anxiety during COVID-19 among psychiatry trainees,2020-07-04,"Coevolution-based contact prediction, either directly by coevolutionary couplings resulting from global statistical sequence models or using structural supervision and deep learning, has found widespread application in protein-structure prediction from sequence. However, one of the basic assumptions in global statistical modeling is that sequences form an at least approximately independent sample of an unknown probability distribution, which is to be learned from data. In the case of protein families, this assumption is obviously violated by phylogenetic relations between protein sequences. It has turned out to be notoriously difficult to take phylogenetic correlations into account in coevolutionary model learning. Here, we propose a complementary approach: we develop strategies to randomize or resample sequence data, such that conservation patterns and phylogenetic relations are preserved, while intrinsic (i.e. structure- or function-based) coevolutionary couplings are removed. A comparison between the results of Direct Coupling Analysis applied to real and to resampled data shows that the largest coevolutionary couplings, i.e. those used for contact prediction, are only weakly influenced by phylogeny. However, the phylogeny-induced spurious couplings in the resampled data are compatible in size with the first false-positive contact predictions from real data. Dissecting functional from phylogeny-induced couplings might therefore extend accurate contact predictions to the range of intermediate-size couplings.","Rodriguez Horta, Edwin; Weigt, Martin",PLoS Comput Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34029316/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008957,336

Forced lockdowns, social distancing, and restricted mobility have contributed to large scale disruptions in the supply chain network. The purpose of the paper is to identify critical factors affecting global supply chain and evaluate strategies for risk reduction in the supply chain network by making it resilient. Our study incorporates multi-criteria decision approach using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) to analyze factors that affected the supply chain networks with the onset of COVID-19. The AHP method enabled to hierarchically rank the factors based on the relative weightage while DEMATEL ascertained the inter-relationships among the factors and classified them into cause and effect groups. The findings of our study identified the cost–optimization as the most significant factor and the human resource management as the least important factor in reducing vulnerabilities of the supply chain network. Our analysis from DEMATEL approach indicate that government support is a significant causal factor which can effectively eliminate the issues plaguing supply chains during this pandemic. The results from our study aim to help policymakers in developing a risk resilient framework that can enhance performance and operational capability of the supply chain, thereby ensuring sustainability and socio-economic well-being of all the stakeholders involved in the entire network.","Das, Debashree; Datta, Avik; Kumar, Patanjal; Kazancoglu, Yigit; Ram, Mangey",Oper Manag Res,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12063-021-00200-4,336

We examined the reach, engagement and effectiveness of online delivery of lifestyle change programs (LCP) modelled after the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) in a multistate, real-world setting. METHODS: Longitudinal, non-randomized study comparing online and in-person LCP in a large multistate sample delivered over 1 year. Sample included at-risk adults (n = 26,743) referred to online (n = 9) and in-person (n = 11) CDC-recognized LCP from a multi-state registry (California, Florida and Colorado) between 2015 and 2018. The main outcome was effectiveness (proportion achieving > 5% weight loss) at one-year. Our secondary outcomes included reach (proportion enrolled among referred) and engagement (proportion ≥ 9 sessions by week 26). We used logistic regression modelling to assess the association between participant- and setting -level characteristics with meaningful weight loss. RESULTS: Online LCP effectiveness was lower, with 23% of online participants achieving > 5% weight loss, compared with 35% of in-person participants (p < 0.001). More adults referred to online programs enrolled (56% vs 51%, p < 0.001), but fewer engaged at 6-months (attendance at ≥9 sessions 46% vs 66%, p < 0.001) compared to in-person participants. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to adults referred to in-person LCP, those referred to online LCP were more likely to enroll and less likely to engage. Online participants achieved modest meaningful weight loss. Online delivery of LCP is an attractive strategy to deliver and scale DPP, particularly with social distancing measures currently in place. However, it is unclear how to optimize delivery models for maximal impact given trade-offs in reach and effectiveness.

Currently, there are no vaccines or drugs available for nCovid-19, hence early detection is crucial to help and manage the outbreak. Here, we report an in-house built biosensor device (eCovSens) and compare it with a commercial potentiostat for the detection of nCovid-19 spike antigen (nCovid-19Ag) in spiked saliva samples. A potentiostat based sensor was fabricated using fluorine doped tin oxide electrode (FTO) with gold nanoparticle (AuNPs) and immobilized with nCovid-19 monoclonal antibody (nCovid-19Ab) to measure change in the electrical conductivity. Similarly, eCovSens was used to measure change in electrical conductivity by immobilizing nCovid-19 Ab on screen printed carbon electrode (SPCE). The performances of both sensors were recorded upon interaction of nCovid-19Ab with its specific nCovid-19Ag. Under optimum conditions, the FTO based immunosensor and eCovSens displayed high sensitivity for detection of nCovid-19Ag, ranging from 1 fM to 1 μM. Our in-house developed device can successfully detect nCovid-19Ag at 10 fM concentration in standard buffer that is in close agreement with FTO/AuNPs sensor. The limit of detection (LOD) was found to be 90 fM with eCovSens and 120 fM with potentiostst in case of spiked saliva samples. The proposed portable eCovSens device can be used as a diagnostic tool for the rapid (within 10-30 s) detection of nCovid-19Ag traces directly in patient saliva in a non-invasive manner.","Mahari, Subhasis; Roberts, Akanksha; Shahdeo, Deepshikha; Gandhi, Sonu",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.24.059204,336

A bilateral continuous phrenic nerve block is a viable alternative to control refractory strong inspiratory effort leading to lung injury in cases with prolonged NMBA use.","Nakayama, Ryuichi; Iwamoto, Yusuke; Bunya, Naofumi; Sawada, Atsushi; Takahashi, Kazunobu; Goto, Yuya; Kasai, Takehiko; Kakizaki, Ryuichiro; Uemura, Shuji; Narimatsu, Eichi",Respir Med Case Rep,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2213007121001179; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34189030/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rmcr.2021.101455; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213007121001179,336
658745,Considerations for delirium screening in response to a case of COVID-19 on an inpatient geriatric psychiatric unit,2021-04-30,"Kawasaki disease is an acute, self-limiting vasculitis in children. Early treatment is necessary to prevent cardiovascular complications. The acute phase of Kawasaki disease may present with hemodynamic instability. An association between viral respiratory infections and Kawasaki disease has been reported. Studies have shown that Kawasaki and Kawasaki-like disease may be associated with and have symptoms overlapping COVID-19. Children with COVID-19 may present as Kawasaki-like disease with pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome, or macrophage activation syndrome. Clinicians need to be aware of the early diagnosis and management of Kawasaki disease to prevent the development of coronary artery aneurysms. The symptoms overlap of multisystem inflammatory disease seen in COVID-19 adds to the difficulties in timely diagnosis and treatment. Children with Kawasaki disease require regular follow-up plans for coronary artery aneurysms. This adds to the difficulties during the changed environment of COVID-19 for control and prevention. Missed diagnosis and early treatment of Kawasaki disease with immunoglobulin and aspirin results in the development of coronary artery aneurysm in up to 25% of cases, with grave consequences. Here, we briefly review the management of typical and atypical Kawasaki disease which has symptoms overlapping with the multisystem inflammatory disease as seen in COVID-19.","Wang, Linna; Zhang, Sheng; Ma, Ji; Ni, Jing; Wang, Juyan; Li, Xiaohong; Mu, Zhilong; Han, Wei; He, Gaitao; Ma, Lei; Shah, Jenifei; Shah, Jay; Jiao, Fuyong",JNMA J Nepal Med Assoc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34508537/; https://doi.org/10.31729/jnma.5698,336
658961,Knowledge and Attitude towards Dental Clinical Practice Related to COVID-19 Pandemic among Dental Interns in Saudi Arabia,2021-06-05,"BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C core protein is an attractive target for HCV vaccine aimed to exterminate HCV infected cells. However, although highly immunogenic in natural infection, core appears to have low immunogenicity in experimental settings. We aimed to design an HCV vaccine prototype based on core, and devise immunization regimens that would lead to potent anti-core immune responses which circumvent the immunogenicity limitations earlier observed. METHODS: Plasmids encoding core with no translation initiation signal (pCMVcore); with Kozak sequence (pCMVcoreKozak); and with HCV IRES (pCMVcoreIRES) were designed and expressed in a variety of eukaryotic cells. Polyproteins corresponding to HCV 1b amino acids (aa) 1–98 and 1–173 were expressed in E. coli. C57BL/6 mice were immunized with four 25-μg doses of pCMVcoreKozak, or pCMV (I). BALB/c mice were immunized with 100 μg of either pCMVcore, or pCMVcoreKozak, or pCMVcoreIRES, or empty pCMV (II). Lastly, BALB/c mice were immunized with 20 μg of core aa 1–98 in prime and boost, or with 100 μg of pCMVcoreKozak in prime and 20 μg of core aa 1–98 in boost (III). Antibody response, [(3)H]-T-incorporation, and cytokine secretion by core/core peptide-stimulated splenocytes were assessed after each immunization. RESULTS: Plasmids differed in core-expression capacity: mouse fibroblasts transfected with pCMVcore, pCMVcoreIRES and pCMVcoreKozak expressed 0.22 ± 0.18, 0.83 ± 0.5, and 13 ± 5 ng core per cell, respectively. Single immunization with highly expressing pCMVcoreKozak induced specific IFN-γ and IL-2, and weak antibody response. Single immunization with plasmids directing low levels of core expression induced similar levels of cytokines, strong T-cell proliferation (pCMVcoreIRES), and antibodies in titer 10(3)(pCMVcore). Boosting with pCMVcoreKozak induced low antibody response, core-specific T-cell proliferation and IFN-γ secretion that subsided after the 3rd plasmid injection. The latter also led to a decrease in specific IL-2 secretion. The best was the heterologous pCMVcoreKozak prime/protein boost regimen that generated mixed Th1/Th2-cellular response with core-specific antibodies in titer ≥ 3 × 10(3). CONCLUSION: Thus, administration of highly expressed HCV core gene, as one large dose or repeated injections of smaller doses, may suppress core-specific immune response. Instead, the latter is induced by a heterologous DNA prime/protein boost regimen that circumvents the negative effects of intracellular core expression.","Alekseeva, Ekaterina; Sominskaya, Irina; Skrastina, Dace; Egorova, Irina; Starodubova, Elizaveta; Kushners, Eriks; Mihailova, Marija; Petrakova, Natalia; Bruvere, Ruta; Kozlovskaya, Tatyana; Isaguliants, Maria; Pumpens, Paul",Genet Vaccines Ther,https://doi.org/10.1186/1479-0556-7-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19505299/,336
659007,COVID-19 outbreak: Challenges for Addiction services in India,2020-04-14,"INTRODUCTION: At the end of the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, more than 78 million known survivors were recorded. The long-term pulmonary sequelae of COVID-19 remain unknown. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of a post-COVID follow-up service to estimate the burden of persistent pulmonary morbidity in hospitalised COVID survivors. RESULTS: A total of 221 patients were followed-up: 44 intensive care unit (ICU) and 177 ward patients. Further investigations were planned as per British Thoracic Society Guidelines: For all ICU patients (n = 44) and for 38 of 177 (21%) ward-based patients who had persistent symptoms and/or persistent radiographic changes on CXR at their initial 8-week follow-up visit. In the ward-based cohort, statistically significant associations with persistent symptoms were being an ex- or current smoker, having pre-existing diabetes, and having a longer length of stay. In patients requiring further investigations, pulmonary function tests (PFTs; n = 67) at an average of 15 weeks post-discharge showed abnormalities in at least one PFT parameter in 79% (equating to 24% of the entire cohort). The most common abnormality was an abnormal diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (TLCO), highest in the ICU cohort (64% ICU vs. 38% non-ICU). TLCO correlated negatively with length of stay and with maximum inspired FiO(2) in the patient group as a whole. In ICU patients, TLCO correlated negatively with maximum inspired positive airway pressure. Computed tomography scans (n = 72) at an average of 18 weeks post-discharge showed evidence of persistent ground glass opacities in 44% and fibrosis in 21% (equating to 7% of the entire cohort). CONCLUSION: Our data add to the growing evidence that there will be pulmonary sequelae in a proportion of COVID survivors, providing some insight into what may become a significant chronic global health problem.

Still, much research is already going on to overcome this pandemic, and we also get succeeded to some extent. Diverse sources such as MRI, CT scanning, blood samples, X-ray image, and many more are available to detect COVID-19. Thus, it can be easily said that through image processing, the classification of COVID-19 can be done. In this study, the COVID-19 detection is done by classifying with the use of a type of convolutional neural network termed a detail-oriented capsule network. Chest CT scan imaging for the prediction of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 are classified in the present paper using a Detailed Oriented capsule network (DOCN). Accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity are parameters used for model evaluation.

Unlike other SARS viruses, SARS-CoV2 does not solely impact the respiratory system, but additionally leads to inflammation of endothelial cells, microvascular injuries and coagulopathies, thereby affecting multiple organs. Recent reports of patients that were infected with SARS-CoV2 suggest persistent health problems even months after the initial infection. In over 90 human clinical studies, the French maritime pine bark extract Pycnogenol® demonstrated anti-inflammatory, vascular and endothelium-protective effects. We propose that Pycnogenol® may be beneficial in supporting recovery and mitigating symptoms and long-term consequences resulting from a SARS-CoV2 infection in COVID-19 patients.","Weichmann, Franziska; Rohdewald, Peter",Int J Antimicrob Agents,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857920303976?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.106191; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33045354/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0924857920303976,336
659499,Smoking and E-Cigarette Use Among U.S. Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-10-06,"Cells are continually exposed to stressful events, which are overcome by the activation of a number of genetic pathways. The integrated stress response (ISR) is a large component of the overall cellular response to stress, which ultimately functions through the phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor-2 (eIF2α) to inhibit the energy-taxing process of translation. This response is instrumental in the inhibition of viral infection and contributes to evolution in viruses. Mammalian orthoreovirus (MRV), an oncolytic virus that has shown promise in over 30 phase I–III clinical trials, has been shown to induce multiple arms within the ISR pathway, but it successfully evades, modulates, or subverts each cellular attempt to inhibit viral translation. MRV has not yet received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for general use in the clinic; therefore, researchers continue to study virus interactions with host cells to identify circumstances where MRV effectiveness in tumor killing can be improved. In this review, we will discuss the ISR, MRV modulation of the ISR, and discuss ways in which MRV interaction with the ISR may increase the effectiveness of cancer therapeutics whose modes of action are altered by the ISR.","Bussiere, Luke D.; Miller, Cathy L.",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v13020200; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33525628/,336
659639,Psychological impact of ‘Lockdown’ due to COVID-19 pandemic in Nepal: An Online Survey,2020-06-20,"COVID-19 prevention strategies in resource limited settings, modelled on the earlier response in high income countries, have thus far focused on draconian containment strategies, which impose movement restrictions on a wide scale. These restrictions are unlikely to prevent cases from surging well beyond existing hospitalisation capacity; not withstanding their likely severe social and economic costs in the long term. We suggest that in low-income countries, time limited movement restrictions should be considered primarily as an opportunity to develop sustainable and resource appropriate mitigation strategies. These mitigation strategies, if focused on reducing COVID-19 transmission through a triad of prevention activities, have the potential to mitigate bed demand and mortality by a considerable extent. This triade is based on a combination of high-uptake of community led shielding of high-risk individuals, self-isolation of mild to moderately symptomatic cases, and moderate physical distancing in the community. We outline a set of principles for communities to consider how to support the protection of the most vulnerable, by shielding them from infection within and outside their homes. We further suggest three potential shielding options, with their likely applicability to different settings, for communities to consider and that would enable them to provide access to transmission-shielded arrangements for the highest risk community members. Importantly, any shielding strategy would need to be predicated on sound, locally informed behavioural science and monitored for effectiveness and evaluating its potential under realistic modelling assumptions. Perhaps, most importantly, it is essential that these strategies not be perceived as oppressive measures and be community led in their design and implementation. This is in order that they can be sustained for an extended period of time, until COVID-19 can be controlled or vaccine and treatment options become available.","Dahab, Maysoon; van Zandvoort, Kevin; Flasche, Stefan; Warsame, Abdihamid; Ratnayake, Ruwan; Favas, Caroline; Spiegel, Paul B.; Waldman, Ronald J.; Checchi, Francesco",Confl Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32754225/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13031-020-00296-8,336
659754,Fatal Underfunding? Explaining COVID-19 Mortality in Spanish Nursing Homes,2021-04-05,"BACKGROUND: SELENON (SEPN1)-related myopathy (SELENON-RM) is a rare congenital myopathy characterized by slowly progressive proximal muscle weakness, early onset spine rigidity and respiratory insufficiency. A muscular dystrophy caused by mutations in the LAMA2 gene (LAMA2-related muscular dystrophy, LAMA2-MD) has a similar clinical phenotype, with either a severe, early-onset due to complete Laminin subunit α2 deficiency (merosin-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy type 1A (MDC1A)), or a mild, childhood- or adult-onset due to partial Laminin subunit α2 deficiency. For both muscle diseases, no curative treatment options exist, yet promising preclinical studies are ongoing. Currently, there is a paucity on natural history data and appropriate clinical and functional outcome measures are needed to reach trial readiness. METHODS: LAST STRONG is a natural history study in Dutch-speaking patients of all ages diagnosed with SELENON-RM or LAMA2-MD, starting August 2020. Patients have four visits at our hospital over a period of 1.5 year. At all visits, they undergo standardized neurological examination, hand-held dynamometry (age ≥ 5 years), functional measurements, questionnaires (patient report and/or parent proxy; age ≥ 2 years), muscle ultrasound including diaphragm, pulmonary function tests (spirometry, maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressure, sniff nasal inspiratory pressure; age ≥ 5 years), and accelerometry for 8 days (age ≥ 2 years); at visit one and three, they undergo cardiac evaluation (electrocardiogram, echocardiography; age ≥ 2 years), spine X-ray (age ≥ 2 years), dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA-)scan (age ≥ 2 years) and full body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (age ≥ 10 years). All examinations are adapted to the patient’s age and functional abilities. Correlation between key parameters within and between subsequent visits will be assessed. DISCUSSION: Our study will describe the natural history of patients diagnosed with SELENON-RM or LAMA2-MD, enabling us to select relevant clinical and functional outcome measures for reaching clinical trial-readiness. Moreover, our detailed description (deep phenotyping) of the clinical features will optimize clinical management and will establish a well-characterized baseline cohort for prospective follow-up. CONCLUSION: Our natural history study is an essential step for reaching trial readiness in SELENON-RM and LAMA2-MD.

This paper describes the characteristics of an infodemic, which combines an inordinately high volume of information (leading to problems relating to locating the information, storage capacity, ensuring quality, visibility and validity) and rapid output (making it hard to assess its value, manage the gatekeeping process, apply results, track its history, and leading to a waste of effort). This is bound up with the collateral growth of misinformation, disinformation and malinformation. Solutions to the problems posed by an infodemic will be sought in improved technology and changed social and regulatory frameworks. One solution could be a new trusted top-level domain for health information. The World Health Organization has so far made two unsuccessful attempts to create such a domain, but it is suggested this could be attempted again, in the light of the COVID-19 infodemic experience. The vital role of reliable information in public health should also be explicitly recognized in the Sustainable Development Goals, with explicit targets.

Recent evidences pointing towards mutations within the viral spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 that are considered the cause for this rapid spread and currently around 200 clinical trials are running to find a treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infections. Nanomedicine, the application of nanocarriers to deliver drugs specifically to a target sites, has been applied for different diseases, such as cancer but also in viral infections. Nanocarriers can be designed to encapsulate vaccines and deliver them towards antigen presenting cells or function as antigen-presenting carriers themselves. Furthermore, drugs can be encapsulated into such carriers to directly target them to infected cells. In particular, virus-mimicking nanoparticles (NPs) such as self-assembled viral proteins, virus-like particles or liposomes, are able to replicate the infection mechanism and can not only be used as delivery system but also to study viral infections and related mechanisms. This review will provide a detailed description of the composition and replication strategy of CoVs, an overview of the therapeutics currently evaluated in clinical trials against SARS-CoV-2 and will discuss the potential of NP-based vaccines, targeted delivery of therapeutics using nanocarriers as well as using NPs to further investigate underlying biological processes in greater detail.","Heinrich, Marcel Alexander; Martina, Byron; Prakash, Jai",Nano Today,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32904707/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1748013220301304; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nantod.2020.100961; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1748013220301304?v=s5,336

Critical care bed capacity per capita in Ireland is among the lowest in Europe, thus, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has put additional strain on an over-stretched system. COVID-19 Community Assessment Hubs (CAHs) were established to mitigate unnecessary admission to acute hospitals, and reduce infection spread by supporting COVID-19 positive or suspected positive patients to isolate at home, or in isolation facilities. There is some evidence that similar assessment centres may be a successful triage strategy to reduce burden on hospital and acute care. Aim : The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 Community Assessment Hubs on service delivery in two regions in Ireland during the pandemic. Methods: A mixed-methods approach will be used, incorporating co-design to engage stakeholders and ensure informed data capture and analysis. Online surveys will assess CAH patients’ experiences of access to and quality of care. Clinical patient data from CAHs will be collected and analysed using multinomial logistic regression to check for association with patient demographics and COVID-19 symptoms, and CAH early warning scores and outcomes (Transfer to Emergency Department, Transfer to isolation unit, Sent home with care plan). Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with: patients to elicit an in-depth understanding of experiences and acceptability of attending CAHs; and staff to understand challenges, benefits, and effectiveness of CAHs. Interview data will be analysed using thematic analysis. Discussion: This study will provide valuable insights from both patient and staff perspectives on the operation of CAHs. We will evaluate the effectiveness and acceptability of CAHs and propose areas for improvement of the service.

Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study of 309 PCR confirmed COVID-19 positive adults who presented to Tulane Medical Center in New Orleans, LA, from March 9 to May 29, 2020. The primary outcomes investigated were need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and in-hospital mortality. A multivariate analysis was performed to determine socioeconomic and medical risk factors for IMV and in-hospital mortality. Results: Compared to white patients, Black patients were more likely to present younger, female, obese, unemployed, and underinsured. However, when controlled for common risk factors, Black and white patients had similar risk for IMV and mortality. Increased age (≥65 years), obesity, and increased comorbidity were associated with increased risk for IMV and mortality. Conclusions: Race and socioeconomic factors may increase risk for COVID-19 infection but did not affect health outcomes within the hospital setting. Therefore, the higher rates of COVID-19 infection and mortality in vulnerable populations may be better explained by lower socioeconomic status, with subsequent higher comorbidity, in these populations.

Another contributory component may be aerial transfer by cholera-infected chironomid insects. To contain the spread of cholera in Yemen, a nation-wide armistice should be negotiated, and national and local committees must be convened to coordinate efforts on the ground. Community isolation facilities with proper sanitation, reliable disposal systems, and a clean water supply should be set up to isolate and treat sick patients. The continuity of vaccination programmes should be ensured. Public health campaigns to educate local communities about good hygiene practices and nutrition are also necessary. The One Health paradigm emphasizes a multi-sectoral and transdisciplinary understanding and approach to prevent and mitigate the threat of communicable diseases. This paradigm is highly applicable to the ongoing cholera crisis in Yemen, as it demands a holistic and whole-of-society approach at the local, regional, and national levels. The key stakeholders and warring parties in Yemen must work towards a lasting ceasefire during these trying times, especially given the extra burden from the mounting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak worldwide.","Ng, Qin Xiang; De Deyn, Michelle Lee Zhi Qing; Loke, Wayren; Yeo, Wee Song",J Prev Med Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3961/jpmph.20.154; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32752599/,336
664769,PL09 Digital sexual health: what we know and what we need to know for effective services,2021,"PURPOSE SARS-CoV-2 has a disproportionately severe effect on men, suggesting that the androgen pathway plays a role in the disease. Studies on the effect of castration and androgen receptor (AR) blockade have been mixed, while 5α-reductase inhibitor (5ARI) use in men with COVID-19 have shown potential benefits. We assessed the association of 5ARI use on risk of community acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS 60,474 males in a prospective registry of people tested for SARS-CoV-2 between March 8, 2020-February 15, 2021 were included. Using a matched cohort design, men using 5ARIs were matched 1:1 to non-5ARI users. Independent analysis using unconditional multivariable logistic regression on the entire unmatched dataset was completed for validation. Primary outcome measures were the association of 5ARI use on rates of SARS-Cov-2 positivity and disease severity. RESULTS 1079 men (1.8%) reported 5ARI use, and 55,100 were available for matching. The final matched cohorts included 944 men each. Mean duration of use was 60.4 months (IQR 17-84 months). Absolute risk for infection was significantly lower in 5ARI users compared to nonusers, 42.3% (399/944) vs. 47.2% (446/944), respectively (absolute risk reduction (ARR) 4.9%, OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.67-0.97, p=0.026). Unconditional multivariable logistic regression analysis of the entire study cohort of 55,100 men confirmed the protective association of 5ARI use (ARR 5.3%, OR=0.877, 95% CI 0.774-0.995, p=0.042). Use of 5ARIs was not associated with disease severity. CONCLUSIONS Use of 5ARIs in men without prostate cancer was associated with a reduction in community acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Lyon, Madison; Li, Jianbo; Cullen, Jennifer; Milinovich, Alex; Kattan, Michael; Jehi, Lara; Sharifi, Nima; Klein, Eric A",The Journal of urology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34433301/; https://doi.org/10.1097/ju.0000000000002180,336

Objectives To examine longitudinal trends in hospitalizations for acute cardiovascular conditions across a tertiary care healthcare system. Methods We tracked acute cardiovascular hospitalizations between January 1st, 2019 and March 31st, 2020. We estimated daily hospitalization rates using negative binomial models. Temporal trends in hospitalization rates were compared across the first 3 months of 2020, with the first 3 months of 2019 as a reference. Results From January 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020, 6,083 patients experienced 7,187 hospitalizations for primary acute cardiovascular reasons. There was 43.4% (27.4% to 56.0%) fewer estimated daily hospitalizations in March 2020 as compared with March 2019 (P<0.001). The daily rate of hospitalizations did not change throughout 2019 (-0.01% per day [-0.04% to +0.02%], P=0.50), January 2020 (-0.5% per day [-1.6% to +0.5%], P=0.31), or February 2020 (+0.7% per day [-0.6% to +2.0%], P=0.27). There was significant daily decline in hospitalizations in March 2020 (-5.9% per day [-7.6% to -4.3%], P<0.001). Length of stay was shorter (4.8 [2.4,8.3] days vs. 6.0 [3.1,9.6] days; P=0.003) and in-hospital mortality was not significantly different (6.2% vs. 4.4%; P=0.30) in March 2020 compared with March 2019. Conclusions During the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a marked decline in acute cardiovascular hospitalizations and patients who were admitted had shorter lengths of stay. These data substantiate concerns that acute care of cardiovascular conditions may be delayed, deferred, or abbreviated during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bhatt, Ankeet S.; Moscone, Alea; McElrath, Erin E.; Varshney, Anubodh S.; Claggett, Brian L.; Bhatt, Deepak L.; Januzzi, James L.; Butler, Javed; Adler, Dale S.; Solomon, Scott D.; Vaduganathan, Muthiah",J Am Coll Cardiol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735109720353936?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32470516/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0735109720353936; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacc.2020.05.038,336
664962,Validation of the Korean Version of the Psychosis Screener to Identify Patients With Psychosis,2021-08-02,"In late 2019 and through 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic swept the world, presenting both scientific and medical challenges associated with understanding and treating a previously unknown disease. To help address the need for great understanding of COVID-19, the scientific community mobilized and banded together rapidly to characterize SARS-CoV-2 infection, pathogenesis and its distinct disease trajectories. The urgency of COVID-19 provided a pressing use-case for leveraging relatively new tools, technologies, and nascent collaborative networks. Single-cell biology is one such example that has emerged over the last decade as a powerful approach that provides unprecedented resolution to the cellular and molecular underpinnings of biological processes. Early foundational work within the single-cell community, including the Human Cell Atlas, utilized published and unpublished data to characterize the putative target cells of SARS-CoV-2 sampled from diverse organs based on expression of the viral receptor ACE2 and associated entry factors TMPRSS2 and CTSL (Muus et al., 2020; Sungnak et al., 2020; Ziegler et al., 2020). This initial characterization of reference data provided an important foundation for framing infection and pathology in the airway as well as other organs. However, initial community analysis was limited to samples derived from uninfected donors and other previously-sampled disease indications. This report provides an overview of a single-cell data resource derived from samples from COVID-19 patients along with initial observations and guidance on data reuse and exploration.","Ballestar, E.; Farber, D.

Even though a safe vaccine exists for this disease, it remains one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in infants and young children. We aimed to create a retrospective descriptive study in which to analyze the evolution of the measles epidemic at the European level. The documentation was carried out using European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) statistics. At the same time, we present the epidemic's evolution in Romania, using data provided by the Romanian National Institute of Public Health and Ministry of Health. European statistical data indicate a high number of patients diagnosed with measles both among children and adults. All European countries benefit from the measles vaccination in the form of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) trivaccine included in their National Vaccination Programme. The vaccination schedule varies from country to country. In the vaccination scheme, most European countries include two doses of the MMR vaccine among the pediatric population. Romania registered a limited number of cases of measles between 1980 and 2015 following the introduction of the measles vaccination in the National Vaccination Programme. Since 2005, the Romanian vaccination schedule includes two doses of MMR trivaccine, administered at 12 months and at 6-7 years. After 2015, as a result of a significant decrease in the number of vaccinated children, Romania is facing a major increase in the cases of measles. Consecutively, a measles epidemic was declared in 2016 and an additional dose of mandatory MMR trivaccine was introduced at the age of 9 months. After 4 years of this schedule of administration, starting with August 2020, the additional dose of MMR administered during infancy has been discontinued. We propose an analysis of the factors that influenced the downward evolution of the measles epidemic in Romania at the beginning of the third millennium. Issues related to the limitation of interpersonal contact in the context of the social distancing imposed by the Sars-CoV-2 virus pandemic are discussed. We consider necessary a detailed documentation of the percentage of new disease cases that will appear in the pediatric population in the near future, in the context of the resumption of daily activity after the reopening of nurseries, kindergartens and schools.","Davitoiu, Ana-Maria; Spatariu, Luminita; Plesca, Doina-Anca; Dimitriu, Mihai; Cirstoveanu, Catalin Gabriel; Chindris, Sorina",Exp Ther Med,https://doi.org/10.3892/etm.2021.10248; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34131439/,336

PEDV blocked the p65 activation in infected cells and suppressed the PRD II-mediated NF-κB activity. Of the total of 22 viral proteins, nine proteins were identified as NF-κB antagonists, and nsp1 was the most potent suppressor of proinflammatory cytokines. Nsp1 interfered the phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα, and thus blocked the p65 activation. Mutational studies demonstrated the essential requirements of the conserved residues of nsp1 for NF-κB suppression. Our study showed that PEDV inhibited NF-κB activity and nsp1 was a potent NF-κB antagonist for suppression of both IFN and early production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.","Zhang, Qingzhan; Ma, Jinyou; Yoo, Dongwan",Virology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682217302192; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682217302192; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2017.07.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28715653/,336

The Program 4 of the Healthy Aging in Industrial Environment study investigates whether the health and wellbeing benefits of physical activity (PA) can be fully realized in individuals living in highly polluted environments. Herein, we introduce the behavioral, psychological and neuroimaging protocol of the study. METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study of N = 1500 individuals aged 18–65 years comparing: (1) individuals living in the highly polluted, industrial region surrounding the city of Ostrava (n = 750), and (2) controls from the comparison region with relative low pollution levels in Southern Bohemia (n = 750). Quota sampling is used to obtain samples balanced on age, gender, PA status (60% active runners vs. 40% insufficiently active). Participants are screened and complete baseline assessments through online questionnaires and in-person lab-based assessments of physiological, biomechanical, neuroimaging and cognitive function parameters. Prospective 12-month intensive monitoring of air pollution and behavioral parameters (PA, inactivity, and sleep) follows, with a focus on PA-related injuries and psychological factors through fitness trackers, smartphones, and mobile apps. Subsequently, there will be a 5-year follow-up of the study cohort. DISCUSSION: The design of the study will allow for (1) the assessment of both short-term variation and long-term change in behavioral parameters, (2) evaluation of the incidence of musculoskeletal injuries and psychological factors impacting behavior and injury recovery, and (3) the impact that air pollution status (and change) has on behavior, psychological resilience, and injury recovery. Furthermore, the integration of MRI techniques and cognitive assessment in combination with data on behavioral, biological and environmental variables will provide an opportunity to examine brain structure and cognitive function in relation to health behavior and air pollution, as well as other factors affecting resilience against and vulnerability to adverse changes in brain structure and cognitive aging. This study will help inform individuals about personal risk factors and decision-makers about the impact of environmental factors on negative health outcomes and potential underlying biological, behavioral and psychological mechanisms.

The situation is similar in Switzerland, a small high-income country in Central Europe, where the first COVID-19 case was registered on the 25th of February 2020. Through literature review as well as correspondence with public health professionals and experts in mathematical modeling, this case study focuses on the outbreak’s impact on Switzerland and on the measures this country has implemented thus far. Along with the rapid spread of the virus, the political organization, economy, healthcare system, and characteristics of the country greatly influence the approach taken in facing the crisis. Switzerland appears to be structurally well-prepared, but, according to mathematical modeling predictions, in order to avoid total collapse of healthcare facilities, the measures taken by the Swiss Government need to reduce the virus transmission chain by at least 70%.

668319,Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Self-Perception of Aging Among Older Adults,2021-02-26,"BACKGROUND: The health crisis caused by COVID-19 has led many countries to opt for social quarantine of the population. During this quarantine, communication systems have been characterized by disintermediation, the acceleration of digitization and an infodemic (excess and saturation of information). The following debate arises: Do the levels related to the psychotic phenotype and pseudoscientific beliefs related to the interpretation of information vary before and after social quarantine? OBJECTIVES: This research aims to examine the psychological effects of social quarantine on the psychotic phenotype and pseudoscientific beliefs-experiences of the general nonclinical population. The following hypothesis was posed: social quarantine alters the levels of magical thinking, pseudoscientific beliefs and anomalous perceptions due to quarantine. METHODS: A pre- and posttest analysis design was applied based on the difference in means, and complementary Bayesian estimation was performed. A total of 174 Spanish subjects responded to different questionnaires that evaluated psychopathological risks based on psychotic phenotypes, pseudoscientific beliefs and experiences before and after quarantine. RESULTS: Significant differences were obtained for the variables positive psychotic symptoms, depressive symptoms, and certain perceptual alterations (e.g., cenesthetic perceptions), and a significant increase in pseudoscientific beliefs was also observed. The perceptual disturbances that increased the most after quarantine were those related to derealization and depersonalization. However, paranoid perceptions showed the highest increase, doubling the initial standard deviation. These high increases could be related to the delimitation of physical space during social quarantine and distrust towards information communicated by the government to the population. Is it possible that social alarmism generated by the excess of information and pseudoscientific information has increased paranoid perceptual alterations? CONCLUSIONS: Measures taken after quarantine indicate that perceptual disturbances, subclinical psychotic symptoms and beliefs in the pseudoscience have increased. We discuss which elements of quarantine coincide with the social marginality theory and its clinical repercussions.","Escolà-Gascón, Álex; Marín, Francesc-Xavier; Rusiñol, Jordi; Gallifa, Josep",Global Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32731864/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-020-00603-1,336

Countries like India, Bangladesh, and other developing countries are still having a slow pace in the detection of COVID-19 cases. Therefore, there is an urgent need for fast detection with clear visualization of infection is required using which a suspected patient of COVID-19 could be saved. Therefore, there is an urgent need for fast detection and clear visualization of infection is required. In the recent technological advancements, the fusion of deep learning classifiers and medical images provides more promising results corresponding to traditional RT-PCR testing while making detection and predictions about COVID-19 cases with increased accuracy. In this paper, we have proposed a deep transfer learning algorithm that accelerates the detection of COVID-19 cases by using X-ray and CT-Scan images of the chest. It is because, in COVID-19, initial screening of chest X-ray (CXR) may provide significant information in the detection of suspected COVID-19 cases. We have considered three datasets known as 1) COVID-chest X-ray, 2) SARS-COV-2 CT-scan, and 3) Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia). In the obtained results, the proposed deep learning model can detect the COVID-19 positive cases in ≤ 2 seconds which is faster than RT-PCR tests currently being used for detection of COVID-19 cases. We have also established a relationship between COVID-19 patients along with the Pneumonia patients which explores the pattern between Pneumonia and COVID-19 radiology images.

In a computational study, we proposed that ion channel activity can be explained by either of two similar ETM homopentameric transmembrane α-helical bundles, related by a ∼50° rotation of the helices. Later, we tested this prediction, using site-specific infrared dichroism of a lysine-flanked isotopically labeled ETM peptide from the virus responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome, SARS, reconstituted in lipid bilayers. However, the data were consistent with the presence of a kink at the center of the ETM α-helix, and it did not fit completely either computational model. Herein, we have used native ETM, without flanking lysines, and show that the helix orientation is now consistent with one of the predicted models. ETM only produced one oligomeric form, pentamers, in the lipid-mimic detergent dodecylphosphocholine and in perfluorooctanoic acid. We thus report the correct backbone model for the pentameric α-helical bundle of ETM. The disruptive effects caused by terminal lysines probably highlight the conformational flexibility required during ion channel function.","Parthasarathy, Krupakar; Ng, Lifang; Lin, Xin; Liu, Ding Xiang; Pervushin, Konstantin; Gong, Xiandi; Torres, Jaume",Biophysical Journal,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349508784042; https://doi.org/10.1529/biophysj.108.133041; http://www.cell.com/article/S0006349508784042/pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18658207/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006349508784042,336

The combined use of sterilizing buffers across non-invasive sample types to optimize sensitive, accessible, and biosafe sampling methods has not been directly and systematically compared.Aim. We aimed to evaluate diagnostic yield across different non-invasive samples with standard viral transport media (VTM) versus a sterilizing buffer eNAT- (Copan diagnostics Murrieta, CA) in a point-of-care diagnostic assay system.Methods. We prospectively collected 84 sets of nasal swabs, oral swabs, and saliva, from 52 COVID-19 RT-PCR-confirmed patients, and nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs from 37 patients. Nasal swabs, oral swabs, and saliva were placed in either VTM or eNAT, prior to testing with the Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 (Xpert). The sensitivity of each sampling strategy was compared using a composite positive standard.Results. Swab specimens collected in eNAT showed an overall superior sensitivity compared to swabs in VTM (70â% vs 57â%, P=0.0022). Direct saliva 90.5â%, (95â% CI: 82â%, 95â%), followed by NP swabs in VTM and saliva in eNAT, was significantly more sensitive than nasal swabs in VTM (50â%, P<0.001) or eNAT (67.8â%, P=0.0012) and oral swabs in VTM (50â%, P<0.0001) or eNAT (58â%, P<0.0001).

This prospective hospital-based study investigated the clinical role and features of hMPV in Taiwan. Methods Respiratory specimens collected from hospitalized children with acute respiratory tract infection between September 1, 2003 and April 10, 2005 were screened for metapneumovirus using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results During the study period, 930 specimens were obtained from 926 hospitalized children. After exclusion of 200 cases due to lack of clinical evidence of airway infection or diseases with known etiology, 726 were included in the analysis. Among these, 33 children had a positive result for hMPV infection. The majority of these patients were admitted during spring and early summer. Twenty-one (63.6%) were younger than 2 years of age. hMPV accounted for 13.3% of respiratory infections occurring between the ages of 18 and 24 months and was as common a respiratory pathogen as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in that age group. The 11 patients (33.3%) with underlying diseases had a similar disease course to those without underlying diseases. A co-pathogen was found in 11 patients (33.3%). Infected children between 2 and 5 years of age had significantly higher titers of hMPV in their respiratory specimens (103.88 copies/mL) than children younger than 2 years (102.26 copies/mL) (p = 0.013) and children older than 5 years (102.25 copies/mL) (p = 0.005). hMPV positive cases were significantly older than those with RSV infection (p = 0.002) and had a shorter duration of hospitalization (p = 0.001), fewer days of oxygen use (p = 0.001) and higher levels of C-reactive protein (p = 0.004). Conclusion Metapneumovirus circulates in children in northern Taiwan during spring and early summer. hMPV was the most common respiratory pathogen in children aged between 18 and 24 months hospitalized with acute respiratory tract infection. Real-time RT-PCR is a sensitive method for investigating the epidemiology and diseases associated with hMPV.

Urgent prevention and control measures have obstructed patients' access to pain treatment, and many patients with pain have been unable to receive adequate and timely medical services. Many patients with COVID-19 report painful symptoms including headache, muscle pain, and chest pain during the initial phase of the disease. Persistent pain sequela in patients with COVID-19 has a physical or mental impact and may also affect the immune, endocrine, and other systems. However, the management and treatment of neurological symptoms such as pain are often neglected for patients hospitalized with COVID-19.

Therefore anti-inflammatory therapy is a very promising strategy for the prevention and treatment of these inflammatory diseases. To overcome the shortcomings of existing anti-inflammatory agents and their traditional formulations, such as nonspecific tissue distribution and uncontrolled drug release, bioresponsive drug delivery systems have received much attention in recent years. In this review, we first provide a brief introduction of the pathogenesis of inflammation, with an emphasis on representative inflammatory cells and mediators in inflammatory microenvironments that serve as pathological fundamentals for rational design of bioresponsive carriers. Then we discuss different materials and delivery systems responsive to inflammation-associated biochemical signals, such as pH, reactive oxygen species, and specific enzymes. Also, applications of various bioresponsive drug delivery systems in the treatment of typical acute and chronic inflammatory diseases are described. Finally, crucial challenges in the future development and clinical translation of bioresponsive anti-inflammatory drug delivery systems are highlighted.","Dou, Yin; Li, Chenwen; Li, Lanlan; Guo, Jiawei; Zhang, Jianxiang",J Control Release,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2020.09.008; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168365920305150; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32911014/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168365920305150?v=s5,336

(2) Methods: Participants were recruited using Twitter(®) as a dissemination tool to reach as many respondents as possible in different parts of the Spanish territory. The participants were recruited in a cross-sectional study, which included answering an online questionnaire. Data were collected from 10 September through 23 November 2020. Respondents answered questions asking whether they intended to be vaccinated and provided the main reason for their answers. To estimate associations between vaccination hesitancy and independent variables, we fit Poisson regression models with robust variance. (3) Results: One thousand and two responses were obtained, of which only 731 were validated. One hundred and sixty-four participants stated that they would not be vaccinated (22.43%), of which 20–24% were non-health workers or unemployed, 17.5% physicians, 31.5% other health workers, and almost 35% nurses. Concerns about lack of effectiveness of the vaccination, lack of safety when vaccinating and possibly dangerous adverse effects were the main causes provided.

672738,Forecasting the SARS COVID-19 pandemic and critical care resources threshold in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries: population analysis of aggregate data,2021-05-11,"INTRODUCTION: The rapid worldwide spread of COVID-19 has caused a global health crisis. To date, symptomatic supportive care has been the most common treatment. It has been reported that the mechanism of COVID-19 is related to cytokine storms and subsequent immunogenic damage, especially damage to the endothelium and alveolar membrane. Vitamin C (VC), also known as L-ascorbic acid, has been shown to have antimicrobial and immunomodulatory properties. A high dose of intravenous VC (HIVC) was proven to block several key components of cytokine storms, and HIVC showed safety and varying degrees of efficacy in clinical trials conducted on patients with bacterial-induced sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Therefore, we hypothesise that HIVC could be added to the treatment of ARDS and multiorgan dysfunction related to COVID-19. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The investigators designed a multicentre prospective randomised placebo-controlled trial that is planned to recruit 308 adults diagnosed with COVID-19 and transferred into the intensive care unit. Participants will randomly receive HIVC diluted in sterile water or placebo for 7 days once enrolled. Patients with a history of VC allergy, end-stage pulmonary disease, advanced malignancy or glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency will be excluded. The primary outcome is ventilation-free days within 28 observational days. This is one of the first clinical trials applying HIVC to treat COVID-19, and it will provide credible efficacy and safety data. We predict that HIVC could suppress cytokine storms caused by COVID-19, help improve pulmonary function and reduce the risk of ARDS of COVID-19. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University (identifiers: Clinical Ethical Approval No. 2020001). Findings of the trial will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals and scientific conferences.

Such disruption has greatly affected hands-on training programs essential to acquire clinical competencies, particularly modes requiring physical patient encounters. While most educational content has successfully been shifted to predominantly web-conferencing platforms, the essential clinical teaching at affiliated hospitals for undergraduate medicine clerkship years has been severely disrupted due to barring of students from hospital premises to minimise spread of COVID-19, presenting a problem requiring unique solutions to ensure that quality of education and subsequent healthcare is kept sufficiently high. To this degree, technological advances increasingly present several elegant solutions which may provide the required levels of educational delivery. In this article, we briefly discuss the number of options that could be deployed to aid in acquisition of requisite skills during the clerkship years, with a focus on wearable technologies and video recording/broadcasting. Given the ongoing pandemic, application of technological advances could provide, with some global coordination, the medical education community with numerous proactive solutions rather than just educational luxuries or novelties.","Yaqinuddin, Ahmed; Kashir, Junaid; AlKattan, Wael; AlKattan, Khaled",J Med Educ Curric Dev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33195800/; https://doi.org/10.1177/2382120520963043,336

Following a methodological framework, a scoping literature review was undertaken. We searched six databases (EBSCOHOST (CINHAL plus; Education research Complete; Australia/New Zealand Reference Centre); Google Scholar; EMBASE (Ovid) [ERIC (Ovid); Medline (Ovid)]; PubMed: ProQuest Education Journals & ProQuest Nursing & Allied Health Source) for the period 2005–December 2015. Critical appraisal for critiquing qualitative and quantitative studies was undertaken, as was a thematic analysis. Twenty-eight articles were included for review, which reported nursing research (n = 23) and student experiences of blended learning in higher education (n = 5). Four key themes were identified in the literature: active learning, technological barriers, support, and communication. The results suggest that when delivered purposefully, blended learning can positively influence and impact on the achievements of students, especially when utilised to manage and support distance education.

OliveNet™ is an active directory of phytochemicals obtained from different parts of the olive tree, Olea europaea (Oleaceae). Olive oil, olive fruits containing phenolics, known for their health benefits, are indispensable in the Mediterranean and Arabian diets. Secoiridoids is the largest group of olive phenols and is exclusive to the olive fruits. Functional food like olive fruits could help prevent and alleviate viral disease at an affordable cost. A systematized virtual search of 932 conformers of 78 secoiridoids utilizing Autodock Vina, followed by precision docking using Idock and Smina indicated that Nüzhenide oleoside (NZO), Oleuropein dimer (OED), and Dihydro oleuropein (DHO) blocked the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein-ACE-2 interface; Demethyloleuropein (DMO), Neo-nüzhenide (NNZ), and Nüzhenide (NZE) blocked the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M(pro)). Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of the NZO-S-protein-ACE-2 complex by Desmond revealed stability during 50 ns. RMSD of the NZO-S-protein-ACE-2 complex converged at 2.1 Å after 20 ns. During MD, the interaction fractions confirmed multiple interactions of NZO with Lys417, a crucial residue for inhibition of S protein. MD of DMO-M(pro) complex proved its stability as the RMSD converged at 1.6 Å. Analysis of interactions during MD confirmed the interaction of Cys145 of M(pro) with DMO and, thus, its inhibition. The docking predicted IC(50) of NZO and DMO was 11.58 and 6.44 μM, respectively. Molecular docking and dynamics of inhibition of the S protein and M(pro) by NZO and DMO correlated well. Docking of the six-hit secoiridoids to IL1R, IL6R, and TNFR1, the receptors of inflammatory cytokines IL1β, IL6, and TNFα, revealed the anti-inflammatory potential except for DHO. Due to intricate structures, the secoiridoids violated Lipinski's rule of five. However, the drug scores of secoiridoids supported their use as drugs. The ADMET predictions implied that the secoiridoids are non-toxic and pose low oral absorption. Secoiridoids need further optimization and are a suitable lead for the discovery of anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics. For the moment, olive secoiridoids presents an accessible mode of prevention and therapy of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Thangavel, Neelaveni; Al Bratty, Mohammad; Al Hazmi, Hassan Ahmad; Najmi, Asim; Ali Alaqi, Reem Othman",Front Mol Biosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33490110/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmolb.2020.627767,336

Furthermore, the study highlights the possible correlation of air quality index (AQI) with the initial trend of COVID-19 issues including the vaccination cases. Based on the statistical data analysis, we observed that the long-term averages for representing the short-term pre-lockdown conditions can impose a healing effect to the observed anomalies in air pollution data. However, the reduction in air pollution during the imposed lockdown series was only a phenomenal consequence, and the trends started reversing during the later phases of partial unlocking, where the correlation showed reversing trends. Being a yearly averaged parameter, the marginal reductions in the exceedance factor (EF) alone could not dictate air quality compared to the AQI. As there is incoherent variability in the pollutant distributions among the cities during various phases of the study, the trend analysis served as a preferable criterion to choose the preferred sources of variations. Based on the results, the correlation analysis revealed that air quality expressed in terms of AQI can act as an important precursor to estimate the critical phase of COVID-19 spread and the effectiveness of various control measures taken during each phase. Based on our proposed ranking, Kolkata and Patna are ranked first in the Tier-I and Tier-II cities respectively according to their responsiveness to the various institutionalized restrictions in terms of air quality parameters.","Vasudevan, Mangottiri; Natarajan, Narayanan; Selvi, Sugashini Masillamani; Ravikumar, Kesavan; Rajendran, Arun Dharshini; Bagavathi, Anushya Banu",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34545523/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-16028-1,336

This study demonstrated that RNF90 negatively regulated RNA virus-triggered antiviral innate immune responses in RNF90-silenced PMA-THP1 cells, RNF90-deficient cells (including HaCaTs, MEFs, and BMDMs), and RNF90-deficient mice. However, RNF90 regulated RNA virus-triggered antiviral innate immune responses independent of STING.

This led us to perform a single-centre cohort review. METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of VIIth cranial nerve palsies from January to June 2020 and the findings were compared to those cases reviewed in the previous year. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 incidence of the cohort was compared with that of the Liverpool population. RESULTS: Our VIIth cranial nerve palsy incidence in the 2020 period was 3.5 per cent (30 out of 852), 2.7 higher than last year's rate of 1.3 per cent (14 out of 1081), which was a statistically significant difference (p < 0.01). Two of the 17 patients in our cohort tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (11.8 per cent), contrasting with Liverpool's severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 incidence (0.5 per cent).

Nevertheless, evidence on the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) is still limited and mixed. In this study, we estimated the pandemic impact on HAI incidence and investigated the HAI type occurring in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Patients admitted to the main ICU of the Umberto I teaching hospital of Rome from March 1st and April 4th 2020 were compared with patients hospitalized in 2019. We assessed the association of risk factors and time-to-first event through multivariable Fine and Grey’s regression models, that consider the competitive risk of death on the development of HAI (Model 1) or device related-HAI (dr-HAI, Model 2) and provide estimates of the sub-distribution hazard ratio (SHR) and its associated confidence interval (CI). A subgroup analysis was performed on the 2020 cohort. RESULTS: Data from 104 patients were retrieved. Overall, 59 HAIs were recorded, 32 of which occurred in the COVID-19 group. Patients admitted in 2020 were found to be positively associated with both HAI and dr-HAI onset (SHR: 2.66, 95% CI 1.31–5.38, and SHR: 10.0, 95% CI 1.84–54.41, respectively). Despite being not confirmed at the multivariable analysis, a greater proportion of dr-HAIs seemed to occur in COVID-19 patients, especially ventilator-associated pneumonia, and catheter-related urinary tract infections. CONCLUSIONS: We observed an increase in the incidence of patients with HAIs, especially dr-HAIs, mainly sustained by COVID-19 patients. A greater susceptibility of these patients to device-related infections was hypothesized, but further studies are needed.

680193,Preparing for the Behavioral Health Impact of COVID-19 in Michigan,2020-12-08,"Rapidly-emerging variants jeopardize antibody-based countermeasures against SARS-CoV-2. While recent cell culture experiments have demonstrated loss of potency of several anti-spike neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 variant strains1-3, the in vivo significance of these results remains uncertain. Here, using a panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) corresponding to many in advanced clinical development by Vir Biotechnology, AbbVie, AstraZeneca, Regeneron, and Lilly we report the impact on protection in animals against authentic SARS-CoV-2 variants including WA1/2020 strains, a B.1.1.7 isolate, and chimeric strains with South African (B.1.351) or Brazilian (B.1.1.28) spike genes. Although some individual mAbs showed reduced or abrogated neutralizing activity against B.1.351 and B.1.1.28 viruses with E484K spike protein mutations in cell culture, low prophylactic doses of mAb combinations protected against infection in K18-hACE2 transgenic mice, 129S2 immunocompetent mice, and hamsters without emergence of resistance. Two exceptions were mAb LY-CoV555 monotherapy which lost all protective activity in vivo, and AbbVie 2B04/47D11, which showed partial loss of activity. When administered after infection as therapy, higher doses of mAb cocktails protected in vivo against viruses displaying a B.1.351 spike gene. Thus, many, but not all, of the antibody products with Emergency Use Authorization should retain substantial efficacy against the prevailing SARS-CoV-2 variant strains.","Diamond, Michael; Chen, Rita; Winkler, Emma; Case, James; Aziati, Ishmael; Bricker, Traci; Joshi, Astha; Darling, Tamarand; Ying, Baoling; Errico, John; Shrihari, Swathi; VanBlargan, Laura; Xie, Xuping; Gilchuk, Pavlo; Zost, Seth; Droit, Lindsay; Liu, Zhuoming; Stumpf, Spencer; Wang, David; Handley, Scott; Stine, W; Shi, Pei-Yong; Garcia-Knight, Miguel; Andino, Raul; Chiu, Charles; Ellebedy, Ali; Fremont, Daved; Whelan, Sean; Crowe, James; Purcell, Lisa; Corti, Davide; Boon, Andrianus",Res Sq,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34013259/; https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-448370/v1,336

Millions of logs are generated each day which makes them important for anomaly detection. However, they are complex unstructured text messages which makes this task difficult. In this paper, a hybrid log message anomaly detection technique is proposed which employs pruning of positive and negative logs. Reliable positive log messages are first selected using a Gaussian mixture model algorithm. Then reliable negative logs are selected using the K-means, Gaussian mixture model and Dirichlet process Gaussian mixture model methods iteratively. It is shown that the precision for positive and negative logs with pruning is high. Anomaly detection is done using a deep learning long short-term memory network. The proposed model is evaluated using the well-known BGL, Openstack, and Thunderbird data sets. The results obtained indicate that the proposed model performs better than several well-known algorithms.","Farzad, Amir; Gulliver, T.

METHODS AND RESULTS: All adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection in two Italian provinces were followed for a median of 24 days. ARBs and/or ACEi treatments, and hypertension, diabetes, cancer, COPD, renal and major cardiovascular diseases (CVD) were extracted from clinical charts and electronic health records, up to two years before infection. The sample consisted of 1603 subjects (mean age 58.0y; 47.3% males): 454 (28.3%) had severe symptoms, 192 (12.0%) very severe or lethal disease (154 deaths; mean age 79.3 years; 70.8% hypertensive, 42.2% with CVD). The youngest deceased person aged 44 years. Among hypertensive subjects (n = 543), the proportion of those treated with ARBs or ACEi were 88.4%, 78.7% and 80.6% among patients with mild, severe and very severe/lethal disease, respectively. At multivariate analysis, no association was observed between therapy and disease severity (Adjusted OR for very severe/lethal COVID-19: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.50–1.49). Significant predictors of severe disease were older age (with AORs largely increasing after 70 years of age), male gender (AOR: 1.76; 1.40–2.23), diabetes (AOR: 1.52; 1.05–2.18), CVD (AOR: 1.88; 1.32–2.70) and COPD (AOR: 1.88; 1.11–3.20). Only gender, age and diabetes also predicted very severe/lethal disease. CONCLUSION: No association was found between COVID-19 severity and treatment with ARBs and/or ACEi, supporting the recommendation to continue medication for all patients unless otherwise advised by their physicians.","Bravi, Francesca; Flacco, Maria Elena; Carradori, Tiziano; Volta, Carlo Alberto; Cosenza, Giuseppe; De Togni, Aldo; Acuti Martellucci, Cecilia; Parruti, Giustino; Mantovani, Lorenzo; Manzoli, Lamberto",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0235248; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32579597/,336

This paper presents the spatial differentiation in the total number of COVID-19 cases and deaths during the full year (March 2020–March 2021) of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Poland versus green-blue spaces (green—i.a. forests, orchards, meadows and pastures, recreational and rest areas, biologically active arable land; blue—lakes and artificial water reservoirs, rivers, ecological areas and internal waters) and population density. The analysis covers 380 counties, including 66 cities. This study used daily reports on the progress of the pandemic in Poland published by the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Poland and unique, detailed data on 24 types of land use available in the Statistics Poland database. Statistical relationships were determined between the above-mentioned environmental variables and the variables characterizing COVID-19 (cases and deaths). Various basic types of regression models were analysed. The optimal model was selected, and the determination coefficient, significance level and the values of the parameters of these relationships, together with the estimation error, were calculated. The obtained results indicated that the higher the number of green-blue spaces in individual counties, the lower the total number of COVID-19 infections and deaths. These relationships were described by logarithmic and homographic models. In turn, an increase in the population density caused an increase in COVID-19 cases and deaths, according to the power model. These results can be used in the current analysis of the spread of the pandemic, including the location of potential outbreaks. In turn, the developed models can be used as a tool in forecasting the development of the pandemic and making decisions about the implementation of preventive measures.","Ciupa, Tadeusz; Suligowski, Roman",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18126636; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34203108/,336
681243,"Prevalence and predictors of depression, anxiety and stress symptoms among pregnant women during COVID-19-related lockdown in Abakaliki, Nigeria",2020-09-02,"BACKGROUND: The current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is holding the world in its grip. Epidemiologists have shown that the mortality risks are higher when the health care system is subjected to pressure from COVID-19. It is therefore of great importance to maintain the health of health care providers and prevent contamination. An important group who will be required to treat patients with COVID-19 are health care providers during semiacute surgery. There are concerns that laparoscopic surgery increases the risk of contamination more than open surgery; therefore, balancing the safety of health care providers with the benefit of laparoscopic surgery for the patient is vital. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to provide an overview of potential contamination routes and possible risks for health care providers; we also aimed to propose research questions based on current literature and expert opinions about performing laparoscopic surgery on patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a scoping review, adding five additional questions concerning possible contaminating routes. A systematic search was performed on the PubMed, CINAHL, and Embase databases, adding results from gray literature as well. The search not only included COVID-19 but was extended to virus contamination in general. We excluded society and professional association statements about COVID-19 if they did not add new insights to the available literature. RESULTS: The initial search provided 2007 records, after which 267 full-text papers were considered. Finally, we used 84 papers, of which 14 discussed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Eight papers discussed the added value of performing intubation in a low-pressure operating room, mainly based on the SARS outbreak experience in 2003. Thirteen papers elaborated on the risks of intubation for health care providers and SARS-CoV-2, and 19 papers discussed this situation with other viruses. They conclude that there is significant evidence that intubation and extubation is a high-risk aerosol-producing procedure. No papers were found on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 and surgical smoke, although 25 papers did provide conflicting evidence on the infection risk of human papillomavirus, hepatitis B, polio, and rabies. No papers were found discussing tissue extraction or the deflation risk of the pneumoperitoneum after laparoscopic surgery. CONCLUSIONS: There seems to be consensus in the literature that intubation and extubation are high-risk procedures for health care providers and that maximum protective equipment is needed. On the other hand, minimal evidence is available of the actual risk of contamination of health care providers during laparoscopy itself, nor of operating room pressure, surgical smoke, tissue extraction, or CO(2) deflation. However, new studies are being published daily from current experiences, and society statements are continuously updated. There seems to be no reason to abandon laparoscopic surgery in favor of open surgery. However, the risks should not be underestimated, surgery should be performed on patients with COVID-19 only when necessary, and health care providers should use logic and common sense to protect themselves and others by performing surgery in a safe and protected environment.","de Leeuw, Robert Adrianus; Burger, Nicole Birgit; Ceccaroni, Marcello; Zhang, Jian; Tuynman, Jurriaan; Mabrouk, Mohamed; Barri Soldevila, Pere; Bonjer, Hendrik Jaap; Ankum, Pim; Huirne, Judith",JMIR Public Health Surveill,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32406853/; https://doi.org/10.2196/18928,336
681653,Effect of the Pandemic and Lockdown on Mental Health of Children,2020-05-12,"The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically impacted lifestyle behaviour as public health initiatives aim to “flatten the curve”. This study examined changes in activity patterns (physical activity, sedentary time, sleep), recreational physical activities, diet, weight and wellbeing from before to during COVID-19 restrictions in Adelaide, Australia. This study used data from a prospective cohort of Australian adults (parents of primary school-aged children; n = 61, 66% female, aged 41±6 years). Participants wore a Fitbit Charge 3 activity monitor and weighed themselves daily using Wi-Fi scales. Activity and weight data were extracted for 14 days before (February 2020) and 14 days during (April 2020) COVID-19 restrictions. Participants reported their recreational physical activity, diet and wellbeing during these periods. Linear mixed effects models were used to examine change over time. Participants slept 27 minutes longer (95% CI 9–51), got up 38 minutes later (95% CI 25–50), and did 50 fewer minutes (95% CI -69–-29) of light physical activity during COVID-19 restrictions. Additionally, participants engaged in more cycling but less swimming, team sports and boating or sailing. Participants consumed a lower percentage of energy from protein (-0.8, 95% CI -1.5–-0.1) and a greater percentage of energy from alcohol (0.9, 95% CI 0.2–1.7). There were no changes in weight or wellbeing. Overall, the effects of COVID-19 restrictions on lifestyle were small; however, their impact on health and wellbeing may accumulate over time.

OBJECTIVES: This study evaluates qualitative outcomes with data insights from the electronic health record, to contrast satisfaction outcomes with the actual use of VC. METHODS: Healthcare providers and patients using VC during the COVID-19 pandemic at a large academic centre in the Netherlands were surveyed for user satisfaction and experiences with VC. In addition, quantitative technical assessment was performed using data related to VC from the EHR record. RESULTS: In total, 1,027/4,443 patients and 87/166 healthcare providers completed their online questionnaire. Users rated the use of VC during a pandemic with an average score of 8.3/10 and 7.6/10 respectively. Both groups believed the use of VC was a good solution to continue the provision of healthcare during this pandemic. The use of VC increased from 92 in March 2020 to 837 in April 2020. CONCLUSION: This study strongly signals that VC is an important modality in futureproofing outpatient care during and beyond pandemic times. Further development in end-user technology is needed for EHR integrated VC solutions. Guidelines needs to be developed advising both patients and healthcare providers. Such guidelines should not solely focus on technical implementation and troubleshooting, but must also consider important aspects such as digital health literacy, patient and provider authentication, privacy and ethics.","Barsom, E.Z.; Meijer, H.A.W.; Blom, J.; Schuuring, M.J.; Bemelman, W.A.; Schijven, M.P.",Int J Med Inform,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386505621000897; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2021.104463; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386505621000897?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33872824/,336

This systematic review aimed to meet the need by determining the predictive value of chronic diseases for COVID-19 severity and mortality. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Complete to identify studies published between December 1, 2019, and December 31, 2020. Two hundred and seventeen observational studies from 26 countries involving 624,986 patients were included. We assessed the risk of bias of the included studies and performed a cumulative meta-analysis. Results: We found that among COVID-19 patients, hypertension was a very common condition and was associated with higher severity, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and mortality. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was the strongest predictor for COVID-19 severity, admission to ICU, and mortality, while asthma was associated with a reduced risk of COVID-19 mortality. Patients with obesity were at a higher risk of experiencing severe symptoms of COVID-19 rather than mortality. Patients with cerebrovascular disease, chronic liver disease, chronic renal disease, or cancer were more likely to become severe COVID-19 cases and had a greater probability of mortality. Conclusions: COVID-19 patients with chronic diseases were more likely to experience severe symptoms and ICU admission and faced a higher risk of mortality. Aggressive strategies to combat the COVID-19 pandemic should target patients with chronic diseases as a priority.","Geng, JinSong; Yu, XiaoLan; Bao, HaiNi; Feng, Zhe; Yuan, XiaoYu; Zhang, JiaYing; Chen, XiaoWei; Chen, YaLan; Li, ChengLong; Yu, Hao",Front Med (Lausanne),https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2021.588013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34540855/,336

In this narrative review, we illustrate how telemedicine technologies are increasingly integrated into pediatric infectious disease programs with the aim of facilitating access to specialist care and reducing costs. There is widespread use of telemedicine for the management of acute and chronic infectious diseases, particularly in countries in which the majority of the population lives in rural areas, far from third-level hospital centers located in large urban centers. Obviously, telemedicine is also used in developed countries, and its importance has been further increased recently given the COVID-19 pandemic. It has many advantages for patients, such as saving time, money and working hours, and reducing cancelled appointments and delays, while there are also many advantages for doctors, allowing collaborations with specialists and continuous updating. Among the disadvantages are the limitation in carrying out an objective examination, which is particularly important for children under 2 years of age, and the need for cutting-edge technology and reliable connectivity. Telemedicine increasingly represents the future and the beginning of a new healthcare system that also will redefine medical care for the treatment of infectious diseases, both acute and chronic. However, the majority of the experience has involved adults, and its validation in pediatric care, as well as its application in real-life practices, are urgently needed.","Pappalardo, Marco; Fanelli, Umberto; Chiné, Vincenzo; Neglia, Cosimo; Gramegna, Andrea; Argentiero, Alberto; Esposito, Susanna",Children (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/children8040260; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33800549/,336

Here, we examined intrathrombotic expression of AQP-1 and AQP-3 using deep vein thrombosis models in mice. To perform immunohistochemical analyses, we used anti-AQP-1 and anti-AQP-3 antibodies. In thrombus samples with the post-ligation intervals of 1 to 5 days, AQP-1(+) areas were over 70%. At 7 days after the IVC ligation, AQP-1(+) areas became less than 50%, eventually decreasing to 11% at 21 days. At 3 days after the IVC ligation, AQP-3(+) cells started to appear from the peripheral area. Thereafter, the positive cell number progressively increased and reached to a peak at 10 days after the IVC ligation. When the intrathrombotic AQP-1(+) area was as large as the intrathrombotic collagen area or smaller, it would indicate a thrombus age of ≥ 10 days. AQP-3(+) cell number of > 30 would indicate a thrombus age of 10–14 days.

Le temps investi à la prise en charge des cas suspectés par les infectiologues, au centre du dispositif de classement des cas proposés par Santé Publique France (SPF), est plus difficilement quantifiable. Cette étude évalue l’impact de cette épidémie sur l’activité des infectiologues affectés à une ligne téléphonique d’avis. Matériels et méthodes Un questionnaire réalisé sur la plateforme Google Form a été proposé aux infectiologues seniors du 01/02/20 au 10/02/20 inclus via la liste de diffusion infectio-flash et la page Facebook du RéJIF. Ce questionnaire comportait 20 questions permettant de préciser le profil des participants puis d’évaluer l’impact de l’épidémie sur l’ensemble de leurs activités. Les questions étaient de type QCM, QRU, ou échelle linéaire numérique. Il s’intéressait à la période du 20 et le 31/01/2020, correspondant au début de la médiatisation de l’épidémie. Résultats Soixante-quinze réponses ont été obtenues, dont 46 de praticiens travaillant en CHU et 23 en hôpitaux publics non universitaires. Vingt-cinq participants exercent en établissement de santé de référence (ESR) pour la prise en charge des situations sanitaires exceptionnelles. La plupart des répondants participent à l’activité de conseil téléphonique en infectiologie, dont seulement un tiers (n =22) sur des plages horaires dédiées. Quarante-sept pour cent (n =35) des participants ont été sollicités par téléphone au sujet de l’épidémie moins de 6 fois au cours de la période considérée, 29 % (n =22) entre 6 et 15 fois et 24 % (n =18) plus de 15 fois. Les participants déclarent avoir reçu des appels émanant du SAMU (n =41 participants), de médecins généralistes (n =39) et de médecins hospitaliers (n =38), mais également de l’ARS (n =23), de journalistes (n =20) et du public (n =17). Les principaux motifs de sollicitation étaient des demandes d’informations sur l’épidémie (n =52), la classification de cas suspects (n =49) et des demandes d’hospitalisation pour des cas potentiels (n =26). L’impact ressenti de l’épidémie sur la charge de travail variait significativement en fonction du lieu d’exercice. Chez les participants exerçant en CHU, le score médian mesurant cet impact était de 5 sur une échelle allant de 1 à 10 (1 correspondant à une absence d’impact), contre 3 chez les autres participants (p =0,008, test de Mann–Whitney). La capacité à assurer ses missions habituelles était également significativement plus altérée en CHU (score médian à 6 contre 2, p =0,0002), en particulier dans les ESR (score médian 7 contre 2,5, p <10−4).

The rapid spread of the virus worldwide prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare COVID-19 a pandemic in March 2020. COVID-19 discontinuing’s a global health crisis. Approximately 80% of the patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 display undetectable to mild inflammation confined in the upper respiratory tract. In remaining patients, the disease turns into a severe form affecting almost all major organs predominantly due to an imbalance of innate and adaptive arms of host immunity. The purpose of the present review is to narrate the virus’s invasion through the system and the host’s reaction. A thorough discussion on disease severity is also presented regarding the behavior of the host’s immune system, which gives rise to the cytokine storm particularly in elderly patients and those with comorbidities. A multifaceted yet concise description of molecular aspects of disease progression and its repercussion on biochemical and immunological features in infected patients is tabulated. The summary of pathological, clinical, immunological, and molecular accounts discussed in this review is of theranostic importance to clinicians for early diagnosis of COVID-19 and its management.","Karmakar, Deepmala; Lahiri, Basudev; Ranjan, Piyush; Chatterjee, Jyotirmoy; Lahiri, Pooja; Sengupta, Sanghamitra",Pathogens,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33374748/; https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens10010005,336
687083,Challenges and opportunities for early intervention and neurodevelopmental follow‐up in preterm infants during COVID‐19 Pandemic,2020-09-25,"BACKGROUND: The outbreak of highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza in domestic poultry and wild birds has caused global concern over the possible evolution of a novel human strain [1]. If such a strain emerges, and is not controlled at source [2,3], a pandemic is likely to result. Health policy in most countries will then be focused on reducing morbidity and mortality. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We estimate the expected reduction in primary attack rates for different household-based interventions using a mathematical model of influenza transmission within and between households. We show that, for lower transmissibility strains [2,4], the combination of household-based quarantine, isolation of cases outside the household, and targeted prophylactic use of anti-virals will be highly effective and likely feasible across a range of plausible transmission scenarios. For example, for a basic reproductive number (the average number of people infected by a typically infectious individual in an otherwise susceptible population) of 1.8, assuming only 50% compliance, this combination could reduce the infection (symptomatic) attack rate from 74% (49%) to 40% (27%), requiring peak quarantine and isolation levels of 6.2% and 0.8% of the population, respectively, and an overall anti-viral stockpile of 3.9 doses per member of the population. Although contact tracing may be additionally effective, the resources required make it impractical in most scenarios. CONCLUSIONS: National influenza pandemic preparedness plans currently focus on reducing the impact associated with a constant attack rate, rather than on reducing transmission. Our findings suggest that the additional benefits and resource requirements of household-based interventions in reducing average levels of transmission should also be considered, even when expected levels of compliance are only moderate.","Wu, Joseph T; Riley, Steven; Fraser, Christophe; Leung, Gabriel M",PLoS Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16881729/,336
687395,COVID-19 and Dental and Dental Hygiene Students’ Career Plans,2021-01-06,"OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic has forced many people to stay at home and to maintain social distancing. This study aimed to assess the association of reduced physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic with new onset of neck pain (katakori) among a rural Japanese population living in areas damaged by the Great East Japan Earthquake (GEJE). DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective cohort study has been conducted continuously since 2011 after the GEJE. This study used longitudinal data from 1608 adults who responded to the self-reported questionnaire before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Changes in physical activity due to the COVID-19 pandemic were categorised into four groups: ‘no change’, ‘decreased by 20%–30%’, ‘decreased by half’ and ‘almost never go out’. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the OR and 95% CI of the association between COVID-19 pandemic-related physical inactivity and new-onset neck pain. RESULTS: In total, ‘no change’, ‘decreased by 20%–30%’, ‘decreased by half’, and ‘almost never go out’ were reported by 9.2%, 27.7%, 31.2% and 21.9% of respondents, respectively. Among them, 9.8% reported new-onset neck pain. A significantly higher rate of new-onset neck pain was observed in participants who reported ‘decreased by half’ (adjusted OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.04 to 3.30) and who ‘almost never go out’ (adjusted OR 2.13, 95% CI 1.16 to 3.91), compared with those who reported ‘no change.’ CONCLUSIONS: Decreased physical activity has increased due to the COVID-19 pandemic and was significantly associated with new-onset neck pain among GEJE survivors.","Sekiguchi, Takuya; Hagiwara, Yoshihiro; Yabe, Yutaka; Sugawara, Yumi; Tsuji, Ichiro; Itoi, Eiji",BMJ Open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-051751; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34426471/,336

687616,Cancer Management During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States: Results From a National Physician Cross-sectional Survey,2020-08-25,"AIMS: SARS‐CoV‐2 infection may lead to endothelial and vascular dysfunction. We investigated alterations of arterial stiffness, endothelial coronary and myocardial function markers four months after COVID‐19 infection. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a case‐control prospective study, we included 70 patients four months after COVID‐19 infection, 70 age‐ and sex‐matched untreated hypertensive patients (positive control) and 70 healthy individuals. We measured a) perfused boundary region (PBR) of the sublingual arterial microvessels (increased PBR indicates reduced endothelial glycocalyx thickness), b) flow‐mediated dilation (FMD), c) coronary Flow Reserve (CFR) by Doppler echocardiography d) pulse wave velocity (PWV) e) global left (LV) and right (RV) ventricular longitudinal strain (GLS) and f) malondialdehyde (MDA), an oxidative stress marker, thrombomodulin and von Willebrand factor (vWF) as endothelial biomarkers. COVID‐19 patients had similar CFR and FMD with hypertensives (2.48±0.41 vs 2.58±0.88, p=0.562, 5.86±2.82% vs 5.80±2.07%, p=0.872 respectively) but lower values than controls (3.42±0.65, p=0.0135, 9.06±2.11%, p=0.002 respectively). Compared to controls, both COVID‐19 and hypertensives had greater PBR5‐25 (2.07±0.15μm and 2.07±0.26μm p=0.8 vs 1.89±0.17μm, p=0.001), higher PWV (PWVc‐f 12.09±2.50 vs 11.92±2.94, p=0.7 vs 10.04±1.80m/sec, p=0.036) and impaired LV and RV GLS (‐19.50 ±2.56% vs −19.23±2.67%, p=0.864 vs −21.98±1.51%, p=0.020 and ‐16.99±3.17% vs ‐18.63±3.20%, p=0.002 vs ‐20.51±2,.28%, p<0.001). MDA and thrombomodulin were higher in COVID‐19 patients than both hypertensives and controls (10.67±2.75 vs 1.76± 0.30, p=0.003 vs 1.01±0.50nmole/L, p=0.001 and 3716.63±188.36 vs 3114.46±179.18, p=0.017 vs 2590.02±156.51pg/ml, p<0.001). Residual cardiovascular symptoms at 4 months were associated with oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction markers. CONCLUSIONS: SARS‐CoV‐2 may cause endothelial and vascular dysfunction linked to impaired cardiac performance four months after infection.","Lambadiari, Vaia; Mitrakou, Asimina; Kountouri, Aikaterini; Thymis, John; Katogiannis, Konstantinos; Korakas, Emmanouil; Varlamos, Charalampos; Andreadou, Ioanna; Tsoumani, Maria; Triantafyllidi, Helen; Bamias, Aristotelis; Thomas, Konstantinos; Kazakou, Pinelopi; Grigoropoulou, Sotiria; Kavatha, Dimitra; Antoniadou, Anastasia; Dimopoulos, Meletios A; Ikonomidis, Ignatios",Eur J Heart Fail,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34415085/; https://doi.org/10.1002/ejhf.2326,336
689097,Stakeholder efforts to mitigate antiretroviral therapy interruption among people living with HIV during the COVID‐19 pandemic in China: a qualitative study,2021-09-02,"Introduction The novel coronavirus disease has disrupted blood transfusion services worldwide. Despite blood transfusion services taking several precautionary measures to minimize the risks of COVID-19 during blood donations, donors became anxious regarding the risk of the COVID-19 infection during the donation and the blood transfusion services was facing the inevitable hazard of blood shortage. Methods The study was conducted at a tertiary care oncology hospital-based blood transfusion services and included analysis of blood donations, packed red blood cell units requirements, and packed red blood cell inventory in the pre lockdown and lockdown phase. New COVID-19 standard operating procedures with enhanced safety guidelines and donor confidence-building measures were implemented at the blood transfusion services. Results The total number of average monthly blood donations decreased in lockdown but the decrease was not statistically significant (238.5 vs. 197.8, P = 0.391). The requisitions for the packed red blood cell cross-matches (722.5 vs. 329.0, P = 0.001) and the packed red blood cell utilization (176.5 vs. 103.3, P = 0.028) for the hospital patients also decreased significantly due to the lockdown. In the lockdown phase, an expressive number of packed red blood cell units were outdated due to the unprecedented fall in the number of patients. In the post-lockdown phase, the packed red blood cell inventory was optimized with decreased outdating via a comprehensive approach. A special emphasis was given to the in-house donations. A second partial lockdown also decreased the blood donations. Conclusion Confidence-building in blood donors and the resolution of logistical issues were crucial for the efficient packed red blood cell inventory management in the lockdown. Implementation of COVID-19 preventive measures helped in the blood donor and blood transfusion services staff safety.","Gupta, Abhaykumar Malind; Ojha, Shashank; Nagaraju, P.; Poojary, Minal; SH, Sumathi; Sathyan, Vimal; Ansari, Aamir",Hematol Transfus Cell Ther,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S253113792100002X?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33521581/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.htct.2020.11.008; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S253113792100002X,336
