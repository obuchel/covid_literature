1243,1243,1243,Human Health Risk Assessment (HHRA) for Environmental Development and Transfer of Antibiotic Resistance,19.145254,2.3925507,2013-07-09,"Background: Only recently has the environment been clearly implicated in the risk of antibiotic resistance to clinical outcome, but to date there have been few documented approaches to formally assess these risks. Objective: We examined possible approaches and sought to identify research needs to enable human health risk assessments (HHRA) that focus on the role of the environment in the failure of antibiotic treatment caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Methods: The authors participated in a workshop held 4–8 March 2012 in Québec, Canada, to define the scope and objectives of an environmental assessment of antibiotic-resistance risks to human health. We focused on key elements of environmental-resistance-development “hot spots,” exposure assessment (unrelated to food), and dose response to characterize risks that may improve antibiotic-resistance management options. Discussion: Various novel aspects to traditional risk assessments were identified to enable an assessment of environmental antibiotic resistance. These include a) accounting for an added selective pressure on the environmental resistome that, over time, allows for development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB); b) identifying and describing rates of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in the relevant environmental “hot spot” compartments; and c) modifying traditional dose–response approaches to address doses of ARB for various health outcomes and pathways. Conclusions: We propose that environmental aspects of antibiotic-resistance development be included in the processes of any HHRA addressing ARB. Because of limited available data, a multicriteria decision analysis approach would be a useful way to undertake an HHRA of environmental antibiotic resistance that informs risk managers.

Concern for the environment in the United States derives from two distinct historical ideologies that we term “green” and “brown” environmentalism. We propose a modern-day synthesis of these ideologies that recognizes that environmental degradation and the emergence of zoonotic and epizootic diseases, affecting both humans and wildlife (i.e., pathogen pollution), are interconnected. This interconnection provides a compelling new reason to protect and preserve biodiversity.","Olival, Kevin J.; Hoguet, Robert L.; Daszak, Peter",Ecohealth,277,11

Objectives: We quantified potential effects of future climate change on the basic reproduction number (R(0)) of the tick vector of Lyme disease, Ixodes scapularis, and explored their importance for Lyme disease risk, and for vector-borne diseases in general. Methods: We applied observed temperature data for North America and projected temperatures using regional climate models to drive an I. scapularis population model to hindcast recent, and project future, effects of climate warming on R(0). Modeled R(0) increases were compared with R(0) ranges for pathogens and parasites associated with variations in key ecological and epidemiological factors (obtained by literature review) to assess their epidemiological importance. Results: R(0) for I. scapularis in North America increased during the years 1971–2010 in spatio-temporal patterns consistent with observations. Increased temperatures due to projected climate change increased R(0) by factors (2–5 times in Canada and 1.5–2 times in the United States), comparable to observed ranges of R(0) for pathogens and parasites due to variations in strains, geographic locations, epidemics, host and vector densities, and control efforts. Conclusions: Climate warming may have co-driven the emergence of Lyme disease in northeastern North America, and in the future may drive substantial disease spread into new geographic regions and increase tick-borne disease risk where climate is currently suitable. Our findings highlight the potential for climate change to have profound effects on vectors and vector-borne diseases, and the need to refocus efforts to understand these effects.

3585,3585,3585,Sharing health research data – the role of funders in improving the impact,19.22551,2.0936978,2018-12-24,"Recent public health emergencies with outbreaks of influenza, Ebola and Zika revealed that the mechanisms for sharing research data are neither being used, or adequate for the purpose, particularly where data needs to be shared rapidly. A review of research papers, including completed clinical trials related to priority pathogens, found only 31% (98 out of 319 published papers, excluding case studies) provided access to all the data underlying the paper - 65% of these papers give no information on how to find or access the data. Only two clinical trials out of 58 on interventions for WHO priority pathogens provided any link in their registry entry to the background data. Interviews with researchers revealed a reluctance to share data included a lack of confidence in the utility of the data; an absence of academic-incentives for rapid dissemination that prevents subsequent publication and a disconnect between those who are collecting the data and those who wish to use it quickly. The role of the funders of research needs to change to address this. Funders need to engage early with the researchers and related stakeholders to understand their concerns and work harder to define the more explicitly the benefits to all stakeholders. Secondly, there needs to be a direct benefit to sharing data that is directly relevant to those people that collect and curate the data. Thirdly more work needs to be done to realise the intent of making data sharing resources more equitable, ethical and efficient. Finally, a checklist of the issues that need to be addressed when designing new or revising existing data sharing resources should be created. This checklist would highlight the technical, cultural and ethical issues that need to be considered and point to examples of emerging good practice that can be used to address them.","Terry, Robert F.; Littler, Katherine; Olliaro, Piero L.",F1000Res,277,5

Plasmids from bla(NDM)-positive isolates were transformed into a carbapenem-susceptible A. baumannii (CS-AB) isolate to assess the role of plasmid transfer in mediating carbapenem resistance. Imipenem, meropenem, and ertapenem MIC90 values against bla(NDM)-positive isolates were 128, > 256, and 256 µg/mL, respectively. Plasmid isolation and polymerase chain reaction revealed that bla(NDM) was plasmid mediated. The plasmids were electroporated into the cells of a CS-AB isolate at an efficiency of 1.3 × 10(–8) to 2.6 × 10(–7), transforming them to bla(NDM)-positive carbapenem-resistant cells with an imipenem MIC increase of 256-fold. In addition to carbapenem resistance, the bla(NDM)-positive isolates also exhibited higher levels of cephalosporins, tetracycline, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, and colistin resistance than the bla(NDM)-negative isolates. Acquisition of bla(NDM)-carrying plasmids dramatically increased imipenem resistance among A. baumannii isolates. Intriguingly, bla(NDM)-positive isolates also showed a high degree of resistance to antibiotics of different classes. The potential co-existence of different resistance determinants on A. baumannii plasmids and their possible transfer owing to the natural competence of the pathogen are especially alarming. More effective infection control and antibiotic stewardship programs are needed to curb the spread and treat such infections in both hospital and community settings.

However, the impact of exercise on the immune responses via toll-like receptor (TLR) 7, which recognizes the common viral genomic feature, single-stranded RNA, remains unclear. To clarify the effect of stressful exercise on immune function in response to viral infection, we measured the changes in the plasma concentration of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interferon (IFN)-α, which are induced downstream from the TLR–ligand interaction, in exhaustive-exercised mice immediately after treatment with the imidazoquinoline R-848, which can bind to and activate TLR7. Both exhaustive-exercised (EX) and non-exercised (N-EX) male C3H/HeN mice were injected with R-848 (5 mg kg(−1)), and blood samples were collected. In addition, RAW264 cells, which are mouse macrophage cells, were cultured 30 min after epinephrine (10 μM) or norepinephrine (10 μM) treatments, and were then stimulated with R-848 (10 μg ml(−1)). In addition, the effect of propranolol (10 mg kg(−1)) as blockade of β-adrenergic receptors on R-848-induced TNF-α and IFN-α production in the exercised mice was examined. Both the TNF-α and IFN-α concentrations in the plasma of EX were significantly lower than those in the plasma of N-EX after R-848 injection (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively), although the R-848 treatment increased the plasma TNF-α and IFN-α concentrations in both groups (P < 0.01, respectively). The R-848-induced TNF-α production in RAW264 cells was significantly inhibited by epinephrine and norepinephrine pre-treatment, although IFN-α was not detected. The propranolol treatment completely inhibited exercise-induced TNF-α and IFN-α suppression in response to R-848 in the mice. These data suggest that EX induces a reduction in TNF-α and IFN-α production in response to R-848, and that these phenomena might be regulated by an exercise-induced elevation of the systemic catecholamines.","Yano, Hiromi; Uchida, Masataka; Nakai, Ryosuke; Ishida, Kenji; Kato, Yasuko; Kawanishi, Noriaki; Shiva, Daisuke",Eur J Appl Physiol,277,5

Traditionally, the extracts were ascribed a wide range of pharmacologic properties with corresponding medical uses, including adaptogenic, diuretic, anti-inflammatory, sedative/anxiolytic, cytotoxic, antitussive, and immunomodulatory. Since the discovery of the archetype withaferin A in 1965, approximately 900 of these naturally occurring, polyoxygenated steroidal lactones with 28-carbon ergostane skeletons have been discovered across 24 diverse structural types. Subsequently, extensive pharmacologic research has identified multiple mechanisms of action across key inflammatory pathways. In this chapter we identify and describe the major withanolides with anti-inflammatory properties, illustrate their role within essential and supportive inflammatory pathways (including NF-κB, JAK/STAT, AP-1, PPARγ, Hsp90 Nrf2, and HIF-1), and then discuss the clinical application of these withanolides in inflammation-mediated chronic diseases (including arthritis, autoimmune, cancer, neurodegenerative, and neurobehavioral). These naturally derived compounds exhibit remarkable biologic activity across these complex disease processes, while showing minimal adverse effects. As novel compounds and analogs continue to be discovered, characterized, and clinically evaluated, the interest in withanolides as a novel therapeutic only continues to grow.","White, Peter T.; Subramanian, Chitra; Motiwala, Hashim F.; Cohen, Mark S.",Anti-inflammatory Nutraceuticals and Chronic Diseases,277,1

This study presents a 5-year retrospective analysis of patients injured due to train-associated events, managed at a level-1 trauma center in India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hospital-based trauma registry data of train-associated injuries presenting between 2012 and 2016 were analyzed. Data from 726 patients were analyzed for demographics, injury events, injury regions, their management and outcomes. ISS and NISS were used to quantify the injury severity. RESULTS: Mean age was 33 years, with male-to-female ratio 86 to 14%. The majority of patients (62%) were between 20–40 years. The median ISS was 9 (IQR 4–16), median hospital stays 11 days (IQR6-23), with in-hospital mortality of 17.4%. Presence of head injury; ISS > 9 and CPR in ED were independent risk factors of mortality. Trespassers on the rail track had significantly more severe injuries compared to passengers (Median ISS 13 vs. 9, p = 0.012; Median NISS 22 vs.17, p = 0.015); however, mortality and hospital length of stay were not significantly different. Location of injury event (on platform or tracks) showed no difference between the severity of injuries, mortality and hospital length of stay. CONCLUSIONS: Current study reports comprehensive injury patterns and outcomes of train-associated injuries from a low- and middle-income country (LMIC). Apart from the mortality, there is a high incidence of permanent disabilities from extremity amputations. No significant difference was noted in the severity and outcomes among patients injured on or off train platforms, emphasizing the need for comprehensive safety measures including enforcement and promoting safe behavior not only on locations like train tracks but equally at platforms.","Bagaria, Dinesh Kumar; Banerjee, Niladri; Gupta, Amit; Kumar, Subodh; Mishra, Biplab; Choudhary, Narendra; Kumar, Abhinav; Priyadarshini, Pratyusha; Sagar, Sushma; R.M.Pandey",World J Surg,277,5

Social support is characterized by four dimensions: emotional support, tangible or instrumental support, interaction or exchange support, and community support. Physical health is measured by self-rated health and body mass index (BMI), while mental health is measured by depression, hopelessness, failure, fear, loneliness, and meaninglessness. The results indicate that different dimensions of social support have heterogeneous effects on individual physical and mental health. Specifically, the correlation between emotional support and individual physical health is not significant, but emotional support is significantly related to some mental health variables. Tangible or instrumental support is significantly related to individual self-rated physical health but not to BMI or mental health. Interaction or exchange support is significantly correlated with individual self-rated health and some mental health variables. In general, there are significant correlations between community support, and individual physical and mental health. The results also suggest that the influences of social support on physical and mental health of individuals at different ages (<60 years and ≥60 years) are heterogeneous. The results of this study provide direction for the dimension selection of social support to promote individual health.","Yang, Fan; Jiang, Yao",Int J Environ Res Public Health,277,5

A key challenge that needs to be overcome to realise the full potential of these technologies is that of precisely predicting the effect of genetic variants on molecular and organismal phenotypes. Notably, despite recent progress, there is still a lack of robust in silico tools that accurately assign clinical significance to variants. Genetic alterations in the CACNA1F gene are the commonest cause of X-linked incomplete Congenital Stationary Night Blindness (iCSNB), a condition associated with non-progressive visual impairment. We combined genetic and homology modelling data to produce CACNA1F-vp, an in silico model that differentiates disease-implicated from benign missense CACNA1F changes. CACNA1F-vp predicts variant effects on the structure of the CACNA1F encoded protein (a calcium channel) using parameters based upon changes in amino acid properties; these include size, charge, hydrophobicity, and position. The model produces an overall score for each variant that can be used to predict its pathogenicity. CACNA1F-vp outperformed four other tools in identifying disease-implicated variants (area under receiver operating characteristic and precision recall curves = 0.84; Matthews correlation coefficient = 0.52) using a tenfold cross-validation technique.

Indigenous-specific protective factors against cardiometabolic disease are also reviewed. Results. Increasing research indicates that there is a relationship between Indigenous-specific stressful and traumatic life experiences and increased cardiometabolic disease risk. Mental health and psychophysiology play an important role in this relationship. Effective interventions to reduce cardiometabolic disease risk in Indigenous communities focus on ameliorating the negative effects of these stressors through the use of culturally specific health behaviors and activities. Conclusions: There is increasing evidence that cultural connection and enculturation are protective factors for cardiometabolic disease, and may be galvanized through Indigenous-led training, research, and policy change.","Lewis, Melissa E.; Volpert-Esmond, Hannah I.; Deen, Jason F.; Modde, Elizabeth; Warne, Donald",Int J Environ Res Public Health,277,5

However, few studies have been done to elucidate their role as targets of immunity. Thus, this study evaluated the naturally-acquired immune response against VIR proteins in vivax malaria-infected individuals in the Republic of Korea (ROK). METHODS: Seven recombinant VIR proteins and two synthetic peptides previously studied in other countries that elicited a robust immune response were used to investigate the antibody and cellular immune response in 681 P. vivax-infected people in ROK. The expression of IgM, IgG, and IgG subclasses against each VIR antigen or against PvMSP1-19 was analysed by ELISA. PvMSP1-19, known as a promising vaccine candidate of P. vivax, was used as the positive control for immune response assessment. Furthermore, the cellular immune response to VIR antigens was evaluated by in vitro proliferative assay, cellular activation assay, and cytokine detection in mononuclear cells of the P. vivax-infected population. RESULTS: IgM or IgG were detected in 52.4% of the population. Among all the VIR antigens, VIR25 elicited the highest humoral immune response in the whole population with IgG and IgM prevalence of 27.8% and 29.2%, respectively, while PvMSP1-19 elicited even higher prevalence (92%) of IgG in the population. As for the cellular immune response, VIR-C2, PvLP2, and PvMSP1-19 induced high cell activation and secretion of IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, and G-CSF in mononuclear cells from the P. vivax-infected population, comparable with results from PvMSP1-19. However, no significant proliferation response to these antigens was observed between the malaria-infected and healthy groups. CONCLUSION: Moderate natural acquisition of antibody and cellular responses in P. vivax-infected Korean malaria patients presented here are similar to that in other countries. It is interesting that the immune response to VIR antigens is conserved among malaria parasites in different countries, considering that VIR genes are highly polymorphic. This thus warrants further studies to elucidate molecular mechanisms by which human elicit immune response to the malaria parasite VIR antigens.

This was confirmed by prominent dissimilarities in fish survival and histology. Based upon the profiling of the zebrafish microbiome, and the probiotic and the pathogen shared gene orthogroups (genetic niche overlaps in genomes), this consequently might have modified the probiotic metabolome as well as the virulence of the pathogen. Although it did not reshuffle the architecture of the commensal microbiome of the vertebrate host, it might have altered the probiotic-pathogen inter-genus and intra-species communications.

The volunteer sample of 64 participants included adolescents ages 13 to 17 years (34 [53%] females; 50 [78%] living in residential care; mean [SD] age, 16.34 [1.01] years) with varying incidents of self-harm in the past year (no episodes, 31 [48%]; 1-4 episodes, 12 [19%]; and ≥5 episodes, 2 [33%]). EXPOSURES: Participants were tested using a standardized QST protocol to establish baseline somatosensory function. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Associations between somatosensory sensitivity, incidence and frequency of self-harm, residential status, age, gender, and prescription medication were calculated. Secondary outcomes assessed whether self-harm was associated with specific types of tests (ie, painful or nonpainful). RESULTS: A total of 64 participants ages 13 to 17 years completed testing (mean [SD] age, 16.3 [1.0] years; 34 [53%.] females and 30 [47%] males; 50 [78%] living in group homes). Adolescents with 5 or more self-harm incidences showed significant pain hyposensitivity compared with community control participants after adjusting for age, gender, and prescription drug use (SH group with 5 or more episodes vs control: −1.03 [95% CI, −1.47 to −0.60]; P < .001). Hyposensitivity also extended to nonpainful stimuli, similarly adjusted (SH group with 5 or more episodes vs control: −1.73; 95% CI, −2.62 to −0.84; P < .001). Pressure pain threshold accounted for most of the observed variance (31.1% [95% CI, 10.5% to 44.7%]; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this study suggest that sensory hyposensitivity is a phenotype of Adolescents who self-harm and that pressure pain threshold has clinical potential as a quick, inexpensive, and easily interpreted test to identify adolescents at increased risk of repeated self-harm.","Cummins, Tatum M.; English, Oliver; Minnis, Helen; Stahl, Daniel; O’Connor, Rory C.; Bannister, Kirsty; McMahon, Stephen B.; Ougrin, Dennis",JAMA Netw Open,277,1

The impact of PVA on clinical outcomes has not been systematically evaluated. Effective interventions (except for closed-loop ventilation) for reducing PVA are not well established. METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the impact of PVA on clinical outcomes in patients undergoing MV (Part A) and the effectiveness of interventions for patients undergoing MV except for closed-loop ventilation (Part B). We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO-ICTRP until August 2020. In Part A, we defined asynchrony index (AI) ≥ 10 or ineffective triggering index (ITI) ≥ 10 as high PVA. We compared patients having high PVA with those having low PVA. RESULTS: Eight studies in Part A and eight trials in Part B fulfilled the eligibility criteria. In Part A, five studies were related to the AI and three studies were related to the ITI. High PVA may be associated with longer duration of mechanical ventilation (mean difference, 5.16 days; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.38 to 7.94; n = 8; certainty of evidence [CoE], low), higher ICU mortality (odds ratio [OR], 2.73; 95% CI 1.76 to 4.24; n = 6; CoE, low), and higher hospital mortality (OR, 1.94; 95% CI 1.14 to 3.30; n = 5; CoE, low). In Part B, interventions involving MV mode, tidal volume, and pressure-support level were associated with reduced PVA. Sedation protocol, sedation depth, and sedation with dexmedetomidine rather than propofol were also associated with reduced PVA. CONCLUSIONS: PVA may be associated with longer MV duration, higher ICU mortality, and higher hospital mortality. Physicians may consider monitoring PVA and adjusting ventilator settings and sedatives to reduce PVA. Further studies with adjustment for confounding factors are warranted to determine the impact of PVA on clinical outcomes.

Psychosocial cancer support services offer support for cancer patients and their relatives. Only a few studies have focused on associations of psychological factors within patient-relative dyads. This study aims to assess associations between the patients’ or relatives’ self-efficacy and their levels of distress and anxiety who seek help together at psychosocial cancer support centres. METHODS: Participants were recruited at two psychosocial cancer support centres in a major city in Germany. Patients with cancer and their relatives seeking support together received the questionnaire before their first support session. Self-efficacy was assessed with the Pearlin sense of mastery scale, distress with the distress thermometer and anxiety with the General Anxiety Disorder questionnaire (GAD-7). For the analysis, the actor-partner interdependence model was applied. RESULTS: The data analysis was based on 41 patient-relative dyads (patients: 39% women, mean age 53.5; relatives: 66% women, mean age 52.16). A significant actor effect from self-efficacy to distress was found for patients (r = -0.47) but not for relatives (r = -0.15). Partner effects from self-efficacy to distress were not significant (r = -0.03, r = -0.001). The actor effect from self-efficacy to anxiety for patients (r = -0.61) as well as relatives was significant (r = -0.62), whereas the partner effect was significant for patients (r = 0.16) but not for relatives (r = -0.46). CONCLUSION: The results suggest that patients’ and relatives’ self-efficacy is associated with their distress and anxiety. Partner effects were visible for patients’ self-efficacy and relatives’ anxiety. These findings suggest that self-efficacy is an important factor for the psychological well-being of patients and relatives and that it may additionally be associated with the partners’ well-being. Longitudinal research with larger samples is needed to support the findings.","Lingens, Solveigh P.; Schulz, Florian; Müller, Isabell; Schulz, Holger; Bleich, Christiane",PLoS One,277,1

This biological phenomenon is induced by wear particles and corrosion products that stimulate inflammatory biological response of surrounding tissues. The eventual responses of osteolysis are the activation of macrophages leading to bone resorption and prosthesis failure. Various factors are involved in the initiation of osteolysis from biological issues, design, material specifications, and model of the prosthesis to the health condition of the patient. Nevertheless, the factors leading to osteolysis are sometimes preventable. Changes in implant design and polyethylene manufacturing are striving to improve overall wear. Osteolysis is clinically asymptomatic and can be diagnosed and analyzed during follow-up sessions through various imaging modalities and methods, such as serial radiographic, CT scan, MRI, and image processing-based methods, especially with the use of artificial neural network algorithms. Deep learning algorithms with a variety of neural network structures such as CNN, U-Net, and Seg-UNet have proved to be efficient algorithms for medical image processing specifically in the field of orthopedics for the detection and segmentation of tumors. These deep learning algorithms can effectively detect and analyze osteolytic lesions well in advance during follow-up sessions in order to administer proper treatments before reaching a critical point. Osteolysis can be treated surgically or nonsurgically with medications. However, revision surgeries are the only solution for the progressive osteolysis. In this literature review, the underlying causes, mechanisms, and treatments of osteolysis are discussed with the main focus on the possible computer-based methods and algorithms that can be effectively employed for the detection of osteolysis.","Saadi, Soroush Baseri; Ranjbarzadeh, Ramin; Ozeir kazemi,; Amirabadi, Amir; Ghoushchi, Saeid Jafarzadeh; Kazemi, Oveis; Azadikhah, Sonya; Bendechache, Malika",Comput Intell Neurosci,277,5

While the direct impacts of natural disasters are well understood, the channels through which these shocks spread to non-affected regions, still represents an open research question. In this paper we propose modelling socioeconomic systems as spatially-explicit, multi-layer behavioral networks, where the interplay of supply-side production, and demand-side consumption decisions, can help us understand how climate shocks cascade. We apply this modelling framework to analyze the spatial-temporal evolution of vulnerability following a negative food-production shock in one part of an agriculture-dependent economy. Simulation results show that vulnerability is cyclical, and its distribution critically depends on the network density and distance from the epicenter of the shock. We also introduce a new multi-layer measure, the Vulnerability Rank (VRank), which synthesizes various location-level risks into a single index. This framework can help design policies, aimed to better understand, effectively respond, and build resilience to natural disasters. This is particularly important for poorer regions, where response time is critical and financial resources are limited.","Naqvi, Asjad; Monasterolo, Irene",Sci Rep,277,5

Various types of scaffolds have found their way into biomedical science, particularly in tissue engineering. Scaffolds with a superior tissue regenerative capacity must be biocompatible and biodegradable, and must possess excellent functionality and bioactivity. The different polymers that are used in fabricating scaffolds can influence these parameters. Polysaccharide-based polymers, such as collagen and chitosan, exhibit exceptional biocompatibility and biodegradability, while the degradability of synthetic polymers can be improved using chemical modifications. However, these modifications require multiple steps of chemical reactions to be carried out, which could potentially compromise the end product’s biosafety. At present, conducting polymers, such as poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(4-styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT: PSS), polyaniline, and polypyrrole, are often incorporated into matrix scaffolds to produce electrically conductive scaffold composites. However, this will reduce the biodegradability rate of scaffolds and, therefore, agitate their biocompatibility. This article discusses the current trends in fabricating electrically conductive scaffolds, and provides some insight regarding how their immunogenicity performance can be interlinked with their physical and biodegradability properties.","Ahmad Ruzaidi, Dania Adila; Mahat, Mohd Muzamir; Shafiee, Saiful Arifin; Mohamed Sofian, Zarif; Mohmad Sabere, Awis Sukarni; Ramli, Rosmamuhamadani; Osman, Hazwanee; Hamzah, Hairul Hisham; Zainal Ariffin, Zaidah; Sadasivuni, Kishor Kumar",Polymers (Basel),277,5

The results showed that the IgY was stable between pH 4 and pH 11. In the incubation with pepsin at pH 4 and pH 6, about 90% and 100% of the IgY activity remained, respectively. IgY activity could remain approximately 80% at 60°C for 30 min, suggesting that pasteurization can be applied to sterilizing the product.

In this paper, we present the development of an alignment-free, digital signal processing based method for pathogenic viral detection named Z-Curve Genomic Cesptral Coefficients (ZCGCC). To evaluate the method, ZCGCC were computed from twenty six pathogenic viral strains extracted from the ViPR corpus. Naïve Bayesian classifier, which is a popular machine learning method was experimentally trained and validated using the extracted ZCGCC and other alignment-free methods in the literature. Comparative results show that the proposed ZCGCC gives good accuracy (93.0385%) and improved performance to existing alignment-free methods.","Adetiba, Emmanuel; Olugbara, Oludayo O.; Taiwo, Tunmike B.; Adebiyi, Marion O.; Badejo, Joke A.; Akanle, Matthew B.; Matthews, Victor O.",Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering,277,5

Dogs in the subclinical and chronic phases can be asymptomatic, and serological tests show cross-reactivity and fail to differentiate between current and past infections. Moreover, there could be low parasitaemia, and E. canis might be found only in target organs, hence causing results to be negative by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on blood samples. METHODS: We evaluated by PCR the prevalence of E. canis in blood, liver, spleen, lymph node and bone marrow samples of 59 recently euthanised dogs that had ticks but were clinically healthy. RESULTS: In total, 52.55% of the blood PCRs for E. canis were negative, yet 61.30% yielded positive results from tissue biopsies and were as follows: 63.15% from bone marrow; 52.63% from liver; 47.36% from spleen; and 15.78% from lymph node. In addition, 33% had infection in three tissues (spleen, liver and bone marrow). CONCLUSIONS: Our results show the prevalence of E. canis from tissues of dogs that were negative by blood PCR. Ehrlichia canis DNA in tissue was 30% lower in dogs that tested negative in PCR of blood samples compared to those that were positive. However, it must be taken into account that some dogs with negative results were positive for E. canis in other tissues.

Nowadays, raw data is available in large quantities. An obstacle to manufacturing control is the short-term handling of events induced by customers and suppliers.

SUMMARY ANSWER: Despite fear and anxiety related to COVID–19 pandemic, 94.4% of infertility patients still decided to proceed with the infertility treatment. What is known already: It has been commonly acknowledged that infertility has a momentous impact on the psychological well-being of both partners. COVID–19 pandemic might significantly exacerbate the feeling of stress, anxiety and depression in patients with infertility problem. However, the concern that delaying the treatment may negatively impact the outcome has led to the continuation of infertility management during the pandemic era. In this context, social distancing and loss of social support could possibly be deepened, contributing to higher levels of distress. The patients may face a high level of uncertainty due to the inability to conceive and the spread of COVID–19 infection. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This is a cross-sectional study utilising a questionnaire distributed to infertility patient in Jakarta. All the women gave their informed consent to collect and use their data for conducting this study. An anonymous electronic survey on Google Forms web application was e-mailed to infertile couples. The purpose of this survey was explained to all participants with a brief introduction. Survey participation was voluntary. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: This study utilising a questionnaire distributed to infertility patient in Jakarta. Patients were identified, and demographic data were collected between 1 September 2020 and 25 January 2021. The survey was distributed to a total of 178 patients with phone and email reminders. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: A total of 178 patients were replied and filled the google form completely. The average age of the patients and the length of infertility were 32.6 ± 1.4 years and 60 ± 2.9 months, respectively. Most of the patients were University graduated (71.8%). Among all participants, 94.4% decided to proceed with the infertility treatment despite the COVID–19 pandemic. Ovulatory dysfunction was the most common type of infertility in women (46%). However, the percentage of the treatment delay due to hospital protocol or the patient’s decision was 39.5%. The age and the length of infertility were significantly associated with higher anxiety levels (p < 0.05). Patients knowledge regarding the COVID–19 infection was not significantly impact the level of anxiety (p > 0.05). It was demonstrated that 37.3% of the patients preferred fresh compared to frozen embryo transfer despite COVID–19 pandemic, and 33.4% of the participants admitted that they had a financial problem during the COVID–19 pandemic. However, 25.9% of the patients decided to continue the treatment during the pandemic regardless of this financial problem. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The use of a cross-sectional study may lead to limited information regarding patients’ characteristics prior to the COVID–19 pandemic. The length and implications of this pandemic are unpredictable that the outcomes of this study may not reflect sustained consequences of COVID–19 pandemic on psychological well being of women with infertility. Wider implications of the findings: It is imperative to offer emotional support to reduce stress and concerns in women with infertility. As the willingness of infertility patients to continue the treatment despite pandemic COVID–19, the risks and consequences of COVID–19 infection should be addressed in managing patients with infertility during the pandemic era.

The measurement of the Adaptive Force (AF) provides the possibility to get insights into the adaptive control of the neuromuscular system in reaction to external forces. It was hypothesized that the holding isometric AF is especially vulnerable to disturbing inputs. Here, the behavior of the AF under the influence of positive (tasty) vs. negative (disgusting) food imaginations was investigated. The AF was examined in n = 12 cases using an objectified manual muscle test of the hip flexors, elbow flexors or pectoralis major muscle, performed by one of two experienced testers while the participants imagined their most tasty or most disgusting food. The reaction force and the limb position were measured by a handheld device. While the slope of force rises and the maximal AF did not differ significantly between tasty and disgusting imaginations (p > 0.05), the maximal isometric AF was significantly lower and the AF at the onset of oscillations was significantly higher under disgusting vs. tasty imaginations (both p = 0.001). A proper length tension control of muscles seems to be a crucial functional parameter of the neuromuscular system which can be impaired instantaneously by emotionally related negative imaginations. This might be a potential approach to evaluate somatic reactions to emotions.","Schaefer, Laura V.; Dech, Silas; Bittmann, Frank N.",Heliyon,277,1

We aimed to explore the role of anti-factor Xa levels in optimizing the high-intensity anticoagulation’s safety and efficacy and finding possible associations between D-dimer levels, cytokine storm markers, and COVID-19-induced coagulopathy or thrombophilia. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study conducted on 69 critically ill COVID-19 patients who received three regimens of higher intensity anticoagulation. RESULTS: Seventeen patients (24.6%) received high-dose enoxaparin prophylaxis, 29 patients (42%) received therapeutic doses of enoxaparin, and 23 patients (33.3%) were on therapeutic unfractionated heparin infusion. Fewer than one-third of the whole cohort (n = 22; 31.8%) achieved the target range of anti-factor Xa. The patients were divided into three subgroups based on anti-factor Xa target status within each anticoagulation regimen; when compared, the only association observed among them was for interleukin-6 levels, which were significantly higher in both the “above the expected range” and “below the expected range” groups compared with the “within the expected range” group (p = 0.009). Major bleeding episodes occurred in 14 (20.3%) patients and were non-significantly more frequent in the “below the expected anti-factor Xa range group” (p = 0.415). Seven patients (10.1%) developed thrombosis. The majority of patients had anti-factor Xa levels below the expected ranges (four patients, 57.1%). CONCLUSION: Conventional anti-factor Xa ranges may not be appropriate as a predictive surrogate for bleeding in critically ill COVID-19. The clinical decision to initiate therapeutic anticoagulation preemptively may be individualized according to thrombosis and bleeding risks. Cytokine storm markers, namely, interleukin-6, may play a role in COVID-19-induced coagulopathy or thrombophilia.","Hamad, Mohammed A; Dasuqi, Shereen A; Aleem, Aamer; Omran, Rasha A; AlQahtani, Rakan M; Alhammad, Fahad A; Alzeer, Abdulaziz H",SAGE Open Med,277,1

The association between clinical characteristics of the virus and neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against this virus have not been well studied. Objective To examine the association between clinical characteristics and levels of NAbs in patients who recovered from COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants In this cohort study, a total of 175 patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19 who were hospitalized from January 24 to February 26, 2020, were followed up until March 16, 2020, at Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Shanghai, China. Exposures SARS-CoV-2 infections were diagnosed and confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction testing of nasopharyngeal samples. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2-specific NAb titers. Secondary outcomes included spike-binding antibodies, cross-reactivity against SARS-associated CoV, kinetics of NAb development, and clinical information, including age, sex, disease duration, length of stay, lymphocyte counts, and blood C-reactive protein level. Results Of the 175 patients with COVID-19, 93 were female (53%); the median age was 50 (interquartile range [IQR], 37-63) years. The median length of hospital stay was 16 (IQR, 13-21) days, and the median disease duration was 22 (IQR, 18-26) days. Variable levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs were observed at the time of discharge (50% inhibitory dose [ID50], 1076 [IQR, 448-2048]). There were 10 patients whose NAb titers were less than the detectable level of the assay (ID50, <40), and 2 patients who showed very high titers of NAbs, with ID50 levels of 15 989 and 21 567. NAbs were detected in patients from day 4 to 6 and reached peak levels from day 10 to 15 after disease onset. NAbs were unable to cross-react with SARS-associated CoV and NAb titers correlated with the spike-binding antibodies targeting S1 (r = 0.451; 95% CI, 0.320-0.564; P < .001), receptor binding domain (r = 0.484; 95% CI, 0.358-0.592; P < .001), and S2 regions (r = 0.346; 95% CI, 0.204-0.473; P < .001). NAb titers at the time of discharge were significantly higher in the 82 men (1417 [IQR, 541-2253]) than those in the 93 women (905 [IQR, 371-1687]) (median difference, 512; 95% CI, 82-688; P = .01) and at the time of follow-up in 56 male patients (1049 [IQR, 552-2454]) vs 61 female patients (751 [IQR, 216-1301]) (median difference, 298; 95% CI, 86-732; P = .009). Plasma NAb titers were significantly higher in 56 older (1537 [IQR, 877-2427) and 63 middle-aged (1291 [IQR, 504-2126]) patients than in 56 younger patients (459 [IQR, 225-998]) (older vs younger: median difference, 1078; 95% CI, 548-1287; P < .001; middle-aged vs younger: median difference, 832; 95% CI, 284-1013; P < .001). The NAb titers were correlated with plasma C-reactive protein levels (r = 0.508; 95% CI, 0.386-0.614; P < .001) but not correlated with lymphocyte counts (r = -0.427; 95% CI, -0.544 to -0.293; P < .001) at the time of admission. Conclusions and Relevance In this cohort study, among 175 patients who recovered from mild COVID-19 in Shanghai, China, NAb titers to SARS-CoV-2 appeared to vary substantially. Further research is needed to understand the clinical implications of differing NAb titers for protection against future infection.","Wu, Fan; Liu, Mei; Wang, Aojie; Lu, Lu; Wang, Qimin; Gu, Chenjian; Chen, Jun; Wu, Yang; Xia, Shuai; Ling, Yun; Zhang, Yuling; Xun, Jingna; Zhang, Rong; Xie, Youhua; Jiang, Shibo; Zhu, Tongyu; Lu, Hongzhou; Wen, Yumei; Huang, Jinghe",JAMA internal medicine,277,1

A nationally representative, longitudinal survey of 2,490 Americans showed that prosocial concern had a larger positive influence on vaccination against influenza in sparser regions, as judged by a region's nonmetropolitan status, lesser population density, and lower proportion of urban land area. Two experiments (total n = 800), one preregistered, provide causal evidence that drawing attention to prosocial (vs. individual) concerns interacted with social density to affect vaccination intentions. Specifically, prosocial concern led to stronger intentions to vaccinate against influenza and COVID-19 but only when social density was low (vs. high). Moderated mediation analyses show that, in low-density conditions, the benefits of inducing prosocial concern were due to greater perceived impact of one's vaccination on others. In this light, public health communications may reap more benefits from emphasizing the prosocial aspects of vaccination in sparser environments.","Jung, Haesung; Albarracín, Dolores",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,277,22

Polypharmacy is commonly encountered as a significant proportion of patients remain symptomatic, and the management of the depressive phase of the illness is a particular challenge. Gabapentin and pregabalin have often been prescribed off-label in spite of a paucity of evidence and clinical practice guidelines to support its use. This systematic review aimed to synthesize the available human clinical trials and inform evidence-based pharmacological approaches to BD management. A total of six randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) and 13 open-label trials involving the use of gabapentin and pregabalin in BD patients were reviewed. Overall, the studies show that gabapentin and its related drug pregabalin do not have significant clinical efficacy as either monotherapy or adjunctive therapy for BD. Gabapentin and pregabalin are probably ineffective for acute mania based on the findings of RCT, with only small open-label trials to support its potential adjunctive role. However, its effects on the long-term outcomes of BD remain to be elucidated. The evidence base was significantly limited by the generally small sample sizes and the trials also had heterogeneous designs and generally high risk of bias.","Ng, Qin Xiang; Han, Ming Xuan; Teoh, Seth En; Yaow, Clyve Yu Leon; Lim, Yu Liang; Chee, Kuan Tsee",Pharmaceuticals,277,1

The four serotypes of dengue infect 50-100 million people each year, yet the only clinical treatment is supportive care to reduce symptoms. Drugs that employ novel inhibition mechanisms and targets are urgently needed to combat the growing incidence of dengue worldwide. AREAS COVERED The authors discuss recently discovered flavivirus inhibitors with a focus on antivirals targeting non-enzymatic proteins of the dengue virus lifecycle. Specifically, the authors discuss the flaviviruses, the need for novel inhibitors and the criteria for successful antiviral drug development. Current literature describing new advances in antiviral therapy at each stage of the flavivirus lifecycle (entry, endosomal escape, viral RNA processing and replication, assembly and immune evasion) are evaluated and summarized. EXPERT OPINION Overall, the prognosis of flavivirus antiviral drug development is positive: new effective compounds have been discovered and studied. However, repurposing existing compounds and a greater translation to the clinical setting are recommended in order to combat the growing threat of flaviviruses.","Botting, Carolyn; Kuhn, Richard J",Expert opinion on drug discovery,277,5

Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests are accurate but costly, making regular testing of every individual expensive. The costs are a challenge for all countries and particularly for developing countries. Cost reductions can be achieved by pooling (or combining) subsamples and testing them in groups1-7. A balance must be struck between increasing the group size and retaining test sensitivity, since sample dilution increases the likelihood of false negatives for individuals with low viral load in the sampled region at the time of the test8. Likewise, minimising the number of tests to reduce costs must be balanced against minimising the time testing takes to reduce the spread of infection. Here we propose an algorithm for pooling subsamples based on the geometry of a hypercube that, at low prevalence, accurately identifies infected individuals in a small number of tests and rounds of testing. We discuss the optimal group size and explain why, given the highly infectious nature of the disease, largely parallel searches are preferred. We report proof of concept experiments in which a positive subsample was detected even when diluted 100-fold with negative subsamples (cf. 30-fold to 48-fold dilution in Refs. 9-11). We quantify the loss of sensitivity due to dilution and discuss how it may be mitigated by frequent re-testing of groups, for example. With the use of these methods, the cost of mass testing could be reduced by a large factor which, furthermore, increases as the prevalence falls. Field trials of our approach are under way in Rwanda and South Africa. The use of group testing on a massive scale to closely and continually monitor infection in a population, along with rapid and effective isolation of infected people, provides a promising pathway to the longterm control of COVID-19.","Mutesa, Leon; Ndishimye, Pacifique; Butera, Yvan; Souopgui, Jacob; Uwineza, Annette; Rutayisire, Robert; Ndoricimpaye, Ella Larissa; Musoni, Emile; Rujeni, Nadine; Nyatanyi, Thierry; Ntagwabira, Edouard; Semakula, Muhammed; Musanabaganwa, Clarisse; Nyamwasa, Daniel; Ndashimye, Maurice; Ujeneza, Eva; Mwikarago, Ivan Emile; Muvunyi, Claude Mambo; Mazarati, Jean Baptiste; Nsanzimana, Sabin; Turok, Neil; Ndifon, Wilfred",Nature,277,33

The developmental origin of kidney DCs has been highly debated because of the large phenotypic overlap between macrophages and DCs in this tissue. METHODS We used fate mapping, RNA sequencing, flow cytometry, confocal microscopy, and histo-cytometry to assess the origin and phenotypic and functional properties of renal DCs in healthy kidney and of DCs after cisplatin and ischemia reperfusion-induced kidney injury. RESULTS Adult kidney contains at least four subsets of MPs with prominent Clec9a-expression history indicating a DC origin. We demonstrate that these populations are phenotypically, functionally, and transcriptionally distinct from each other. We also show these kidney MPs exhibit unique age-dependent developmental heterogeneity. Kidneys from newborn mice contain a prominent population of embryonic-derived MHCIInegF4/80hiCD11blow macrophages that express T cell Ig and mucin domain containing 4 (TIM-4) and MER receptor tyrosine kinase (MERTK). These macrophages are replaced within a few weeks after birth by phenotypically similar cells that express MHCII but lack TIM-4 and MERTK. MHCII+F4/80hi cells exhibit prominent Clec9a-expression history in adulthood but not early life, indicating additional age-dependent developmental heterogeneity. In AKI, MHCIInegF4/80hi cells reappear in adult kidneys as a result of MHCII downregulation by resident MHCII+F4/80hi cells, possibly in response to prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). RNA sequencing further suggests MHCII+F4/80hi cells help coordinate the recruitment of inflammatory cells during renal injury. CONCLUSIONS Distinct developmental programs contribute to renal DC and macrophage populations throughout life, which could have important implications for therapies targeting these cells.","Salei, Natallia; Rambichler, Stephan; Salvermoser, Johanna; Papaioannou, Nikos E; Schuchert, Ronja; Pakalniškytė, Dalia; Li, Na; Marschner, Julian A; Lichtnekert, Julia; Stremmel, Christopher; Cernilogar, Filippo M; Salvermoser, Melanie; Walzog, Barbara; Straub, Tobias; Schotta, Gunnar; Anders, Hans-Joachim; Schulz, Christian; Schraml, Barbara U",Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,277,31

DESIGN Cross-sectional survey study. Participants and setting: Infection preventionists in acute care hospitals in the United States (US), the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Japan. METHODS Data collected from hospital surveys distributed between 2015 and 2017 were evaluated to determine the use of practices to prevent catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI), central-line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). Descriptive statistics were used to examine hospital characteristics and the percentage of hospitals reporting regular use of each infection prevention practice. RESULTS Survey response rates were 59% in the United States, 65% in the Netherlands, 77% in Switzerland, and 65% in Japan. Several recommended practices were used in the majority of hospitals: aseptic catheter insertion and maintenance (CAUTI), maximum sterile barrier precautions (CLABSI), semirecumbent patient positioning (VAP), and contact precautions and routine daily cleaning (CDI). Other prevention practices for CAUTI and VAP were used less frequently, particularly in Swiss and Japanese hospitals.

Data on five air pollutants, namely, PM10, SO2, CO, O3, and NO2, from five monitoring stations located in five regions in Jakarta (West, East, Central, North, and South Jakarta) were utilized. We analyzed the changes in the concentrations of outdoor air pollutants before lockdown from January 1 to April 9, 2020, and during lockdown from April 10 to June 4, 2020. Overall, the CO concentration (39.9%) demonstrated the most significant reduction during lockdown, followed by NO2 (7.5%) and then SO2 (5.7%). However, we unexpectedly found that during lockdown, the PM10 concentration in Jakarta increased by 10.9% due to the southwest monsoon during the seasonal change in Jakarta. Among the five cities in Jakarta, East and Central Jakarta experienced the maximum improvement in their air quality, whereas North Jakarta had the least air quality improvement.

Current anti-platelet therapies target the ADP-mediated signaling pathway, which displays significant pharmacogenetic variation for platelet reactivity. The focus of this study was to define underlying population differences in platelet function in an effort to identify novel molecular targets for future anti-platelet therapy. We performed deep coverage RNA-Seq to compare gene expression levels in platelets derived from a cohort of healthy volunteers defined by ancestry determination. We identified >13,000 expressed platelet genes of which 480 were significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between AAs and EAs. DEGs encoding proteins known or predicted to modulate platelet aggregation, morphology or platelet count were up-regulated in AA platelets. Numerous G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), ion channels, and pro-inflammatory cytokines not previously associated with platelet function were likewise differentially expressed. Many of the signaling proteins represent potential pharmacologic targets of intervention. Notably, we confirmed the differential expression of cytokines IL32 and PROK2 in an independent cohort by qRT-PCR, and provide functional validation of the opposing actions of these two cytokines on collagen-induced AA platelet aggregation. Using GTEx whole blood data, we identified 516 eQTLs with Fst values >0.25, suggesting that population-differentiated alleles may contribute to differences in gene expression. This study identifies gene expression differences at the population level that may affect platelet function and serve as potential biomarkers to identify CVD risk. Additionally, our analysis uncovers candidate novel druggable targets for future anti-platelet therapies.","Garofano, Kaitlin; Park, C Sehwan; Alarcon, Cristina; Avitia, Juan; Barbour, April; Diemert, David; Fraser, Claire M; Friedman, Paula N; Horvath, Anelia; Rashid, Kameron; Shaazuddin, Mohammed; Sidahmed, Alfateh; O'Brien, Travis J; Perera, Minoli A; Lee, Norman H",Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,277,1

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Hospitalized COVID-19 patients (N = 271) were subdivided based on at-admission glycemic status: 1) glucose levels <7.78 mmol/L (NG) (N = 149 [55.0%]; median glucose 5.99 mmol/L [range 5.38-6.72]), 2) known diabetes mellitus (DM) (N = 56 [20.7%]; 9.18 mmol/L [7.67-12.71]), and 3) no diabetes and glucose levels ≥7.78 mmol/L (HG) (N = 66 [24.3%]; 8.57 mmol/L [8.18-10.47]). RESULTS Neutrophils were higher and lymphocytes and PaO2/FiO2 lower in HG than in DM and NG patients. DM and HG patients had higher D-dimer and worse inflammatory profile. Mortality was greater in HG (39.4% vs. 16.8%; unadjusted hazard ratio [HR] 2.20, 95% CI 1.27-3.81, P = 0.005) than in NG (16.8%) and marginally so in DM (28.6%; 1.73, 0.92-3.25, P = 0.086) patients. Upon multiple adjustments, only HG remained an independent predictor (HR 1.80, 95% CI 1.03-3.15, P = 0.04).

Drawing on data gathered at ages 15-19 in two-three-wave longitudinal studies, we investigated cross-lagged paths between school burnout and depressive symptoms. In Study 1 the participants were 15-year-old adolescents (Time 1: N = 611, Time 2: N = 614, Time 3: N = 725) who completed the School Burnout Inventory and depressive symptoms twice during their final term of comprehensive school and once after the transition to upper secondary high school or vocational school.

Results of both studies revealed moderate stability for both school burnout and depressive symptoms. They also showed that school burnout more strongly predicted subsequent depressive symptoms later on than vice versa. Lastly, they revealed cumulative cycles between school burnout and depressive symptoms.","Salmela-Aro, Katariina; Savolainen, Hannu; Holopainen, Leena",Journal of youth and adolescence,277,16

It is contagious in humans and is the cause of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In the current analysis, we searched for SARS-CoV-2 sequences within the human genome. To compare the SARS-CoV-2 genome to the human genome, we used the blast-like alignment tool (BLAT) of the University of California, Santa Cruz Genome Browser. BLAT can align a user sequence of 25 bases or more to the genome. BLAT search results revealed a 117-base pair SARS-CoV-2 sequence in the human genome with 94.6% identity. The sequence was in chromosome 1p within an intronic region of the netrin G1 (NTNG1) gene. The sequence matched a sequence in the SARS-CoV-2 orf1b (open reading frames) gene. The SARS-CoV-2 human sequence lies within non-structural proteins 14 and 15 (NSP14 and NSP15), and is quite close to the viral spike sequence, separated only by NSP16, a 904-base pair sequence. The mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 infection is the binding of the virus spike protein to the membrane-bound form of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and internalization of the complex by the host cell. It is probably no accident that a sequence from the SARS-CoV-2 orf1b gene is found in the human NTNG1 gene, implicated in schizophrenia, and that haloperidol, used to treat schizophrenia, may also be a treatment for COVID-19. We suggest, therefore, that it is important to investigate other haloperidol analogs. Among them are benperidol, bromperidol, bromperidol decanoate, droperidol, seperidol hydrochloride, and trifluperidol. These analogs might be valuable in the treatment of COVID-19 and other coronavirus infections.","Lehrer, Steven; Rheinstein, Peter H",In vivo,277,7

METHODS This is a national survey study among OHNS residents. All OHNS residency programs were identified via the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education website. A total of 64/127 (50.3%) of OHNS programs were selected based on a random number generator. The main outcome measure was the number of OHNS residents with access to robotic surgery training and assessment of operative experience in robotic surgery among those residents. RESULTS A total of 140 OHNS residents participated in the survey, of which 59.3% (n = 83) were male. Response rate was 40.2%. Respondents came from middle 50.0% (n = 70), southern 17.8% (n = 25), western 17.8% (n = 25), and eastern sections 14.3% (n = 20). Most respondents (94.3%, n = 132) reported that their institution utilized a robot for head and neck surgery. Resident experience at the bedside increased in the junior years of training and console experience increased across the years particularly for more senior residents. However, 63.4% of residents reported no operative experience at the console. Only 11.4% of programs have a structured robotics training program. CONCLUSION This survey indicated that nearly all OHNS residencies utilize robotic surgery in their clinical practice with residents receiving little formal education in robotics or experience at the console. OHNS residencies should aim to increase access to training opportunities in order to increase resident competency.

SAMPLE 22 vials of preservative-free alfaxalone. PROCEDURES 2 storage conditions (room temperature, 22°C; refrigerated temperature, 4°C) and 3 handling techniques (closed system transfer device, nonclosed dispensing pin, and manufacturer-supplied vial stopper) comprised 6 treatment groups (3 replicates/group). An aliquot (0.5 mL) was withdrawn from each vial daily for 14 days. Samples were immediately inoculated into tryptic soy broth and incubated at 36°C for 24 hours; samples were subcultured onto 5% Columbia sheep blood agar and incubated for 48 hours. Isolated colonies were evaluated for identification. RESULTS There was no evidence of microbial contamination of vials stored for 7 days in refrigeration and handled with a protected port (closed system transfer device or nonclosed dispensing pin). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE The US FDA prohibits the use of alfaxalone beyond 6 hours after the vial stopper is broached (punctured), as mandated for a preservative-free injectable medication. Findings for the study reported here supported the use of alfaxalone for 7 days when refrigerated and handled with a single puncture of the stopper by use of a protected port (closed system transfer device or nonclosed dispensing pin). This would appear to be a practical alternative for an injectable anesthetic. It would minimize drug waste and the subsequent environmental impact for disposal of unused drug and allow standardization of storage and handling protocols for alfaxalone use in veterinary practices across the United States.","Whitehead, Michelle C; Vanetten, Chelsey L; Jacob, Megan E; Harrison, Tara M",American journal of veterinary research,277,20

The planar laser is coplanar to the two-dimensional (2D) reference. The combination of a circle on the 2D reference, a point on the 2D reference and a random point on the laser stripe is considered as the invariant, which is impervious to the projection from the laser plane to the image. Therefore, the reconstruction model is achieved by the invariant, which is generated from the projections of the above geometric features. The experiments are performed to verify the performance and reconstruction error of the method. The minimum error is 0.473 mm for the camera-reference distance of 600 mm, the scaleplate-projector distance of 100 mm and the reference length of 30 mm. Besides, the maximum error is 4.960 mm, for the camera-reference distance of 900 mm, the scaleplate-projector distance of 400 mm and the reference length of 120 mm. The reconstruction error means of 0.891 mm, 1.365 mm, 2.578 mm and 3.767 mm are observed with respect to the test conditions of 600-900 mm, which proves the applicability of the reconstruction method with the point-circle invariant.","Xu, Guan; Chen, Fang; Chen, Rong; Li, Xiaotao",Scientific reports,277,14

However, in the point-of-care (POC) setting, apical 2-chamber views are often difficult to obtain, limiting the usefulness of this approach. Since most POC physicians often rely on visual assessment of apical 4-chamber and parasternal long-axis views, our algorithm was adapted to use either one of these 3 views or any combination. This study aimed to (1) test the accuracy of these automated estimates; (2) determine whether they could be used to accurately classify LV function. METHODS Reference EF was obtained using conventional biplane measurements by experienced echocardiographers. In protocol 1, we used echocardiographic images from 166 clinical examinations. Both automated and reference EF values were used to categorize LV function as hyperdynamic (EF>73%), normal (53%-73%), mildly-to-moderately (30%-52%), or severely reduced (<30%). Additionally, LV function was visually estimated for each view by 10 experienced physicians. Accuracy of the detection of reduced LV function (EF<53%) by the automated classification and physicians' interpretation was assessed against the reference classification. In protocol 2, we tested the new machine-learning algorithm in the POC setting on images acquired by nurses using a portable imaging system. RESULTS Protocol 1: the agreement with the reference EF values was good (intraclass correlation, 0.86-0.95), with biases <2%. Machine-learning classification of LV function showed similar accuracy to that by physicians in most views, with only 10% to 15% cases where it was less accurate. Protocol 2: the agreement with the reference values was excellent (intraclass correlation=0.84) with a minimal bias of 2.5±6.4%. CONCLUSIONS The new machine-learning algorithm allows accurate automated evaluation of LV function from echocardiographic views commonly used in the POC setting. This approach will enable more POC personnel to accurately assess LV function.","Asch, Federico M; Mor-Avi, Victor; Rubenson, David; Goldstein, Steven; Saric, Muhamed; Mikati, Issam; Surette, Samuel; Chaudhry, Ali; Poilvert, Nicolas; Hong, Ha; Horowitz, Russ; Park, Daniel; Diaz-Gomez, Jose L; Boesch, Brandon; Nikravan, Sara; Liu, Rachel B; Philips, Carolyn; Thomas, James D; Martin, Randolph P; Lang, Roberto M",Circulation.

METHODS We retrospectively reviewed medical records of neurosurgical patients who underwent first-time, bilateral, 1-3 level laminectomies for degenerative lumbar disease. Patients with discectomy, complete facetectomy, and fusion were excluded. RESULTS Five hundred patients were followed for an average of 46.79 months. Following lumbar laminectomy, patients experienced statistically significant improvement in back pain, neurogenic claudication, radiculopathy, weakness, and sensory deficits. The rate of intraoperative durotomy was 10.00%; however, 1.60% experienced a postoperative cerebrospinal fluid leak. The risk of experiencing at least one postoperative complication with a lumbar laminectomy was 5.60%. Seventy-two patients (14.40%) required reoperations for progression of degenerative disease over a mean of 3.40 years. The most common symptoms prior to reoperation included back pain (54.17%), radiculopathy (47.22%), weakness (18.06%), sensory deficit (15.28%), and neurogenic claudication (19.44%). The relative risk of reoperation for patients with postoperative back pain was 6.14 times higher than those without postoperative back pain (P < 0.001). Of the 72 patients undergoing reoperations, 55.56% underwent decompression alone, while 44.44% underwent decompression and posterolateral fusions.

Primary endpoint was Local Tumor Progression-Free Survival (LTPFS) while Overall Survival (OS) was also assessed as secondary endpoint.Results: From January 2014 to June 2019, 29 patients with 117 nodules underwent RFA. Technique effectiveness 1 month after RFA was 92.3%; median LTPFS was 9.27 months. Univariate analysis and multivariate analysis showed that LTPFS was significantly related to tumor size ≥20 mm. At a median follow up of 39.9 months, median OS from the date of RFA was 27.5 months, with an OS of 89%, 45% and 11% at 1, 2 and 4 years, respectively. Number of overall lesions and the sum of their diameter at the moment of the first RFA significantly affected OS in multivariate analysis. Minor and major complication rates were 14% and 7%, respectively.Conclusion: Tumor size ≥20 mm was associated with lower LTPFS, representing a potential useful threshold value.

Adequate strategies to target inflammation in cardiovascular disease are in their infancy and remain an avenue of great interest. The purinergic receptor P2X7 is a ubiquitously expressed receptor that predominately mediates inflammation and cellular death. P2X7 is a ligand-gated cation channel that is activated in response to high concentrations of extracellular ATP, triggering the assembly and activation of the NLRP3 (nuclear oligomerization domain like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3) inflammasome and subsequent release of proinflammatory cytokines IL (interleukin)-1β and IL-18. Increased P2X7 activation and IL-1β and IL-18 concentrations have been implicated in the development of many cardiovascular conditions including hypertension, atherosclerosis, ischemia/reperfusion injury, and heart failure. P2X7 receptor KO (knockout) mice exhibit a significant attenuation of the inflammatory response, which corresponds with reduced disease severity. P2X7 antagonism blunts blood pressure elevation in hypertension and progression of atherosclerosis in animal models. IL-1β and IL-18 inhibition has shown efficacy in clinical trials reducing major adverse cardiac events, including myocardial infarction, and heart failure. With several P2X7 antagonists available with proven safety margins, P2X7 antagonism could represent an untapped potential for therapeutic intervention in cardiovascular disorders.","Shokoples, Brandon G; Paradis, Pierre; Schiffrin, Ernesto L","Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",277,1

Data from some studies suggest that HBoV may be the etiological agent responsible for respiratory tract disease, particularly in young children. HBoV, however, is frequently detected in the presence of other common respiratory viruses. HBoV is not confined to the respiratory tract as evidence of the virus has been detected in serum and stool, the significance of which remains unclear. Presence of the virus in respiratory secretions, serum and stool suggests that this virus may cause systemic illness. SUMMARY HBoV is an emerging human parvovirus. The full spectrum of disease associated with HBoV remains to be defined.","Kahn, Jeffrey",Current opinion in pediatrics,277,24

A feedback cycle between nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT) defect and TDP-43 aggregation was shown to contribute to accumulation of TDP-43 in the cytoplasm. However, little is known about cellular factors that can control the activity of NCT, thereby affecting TDP-43 accumulation in the cytoplasm. Here, we identified via FRAP and optogenetics cytosolic calcium as a key cellular factor controlling NCT of TDP-43. Dynamic and reversible changes in TDP-43 localization were observed in Drosophila sensory neurons during development. Genetic and immunohistochemical analyses identified the cytosolic calcium-Calpain-A-Importin α3 pathway as a regulatory mechanism underlying NCT of TDP-43. In C9orf72 ALS fly models, upregulation of the pathway activity by increasing cytosolic calcium reduced cytoplasmic accumulation of TDP-43 and mitigated behavioral defects. Together, these results suggest the calcium-Calpain-A-Importin α3 pathway as a potential therapeutic target of ALS.","Park, Jeong Hyang; Chung, Chang Geon; Park, Sung Soon; Lee, Davin; Kim, Kyung Min; Jeong, Yeonjin; Kim, Eun Seon; Cho, Jae Ho; Jeon, Yu-Mi; Shen, C-K James; Kim, Hyung-Jun; Hwang, Daehee; Lee, Sung Bae",eLife,277,26

Triaging supply is one proposed strategy; however, few data concerning the urgency of transfusion are available to inform planning. This study sought to determine the proportion of red blood cells (RBCs) used for clinically urgent indications. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS A total of 5132 RBC units were randomly selected at point of production and distributed into general statewide inventory over a 9-month period. These selected units carried case report forms, for completion at the point of hospital issue for transfusion. Completed forms were returned to the blood service for collation and analysis, capturing information on indication and clinical urgency of supply, including use for potentially deferrable elective surgery. RESULTS Data from 5052 RBC units indicated that 95.6% were transfused. Approximately one-third of transfused units were used to support surgery, one-third for hematology/oncology, and one-third for other medical and miscellaneous indications. Where used for surgery, 25.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 23.4%-28.0%) were for elective procedures, although urgency of surgery was unknown in 17.1% (95% CI, 15.2%-19.2%) of cases. Supply for nonurgent medical indications and elective surgery only accounted for 9.8% (95% CI, 9.0%-10.6%) of use, with 53.4% (95% CI, 52.0%-54.8%) of RBCs required within 24 hours. CONCLUSIONS The majority of RBCs are transfused with a high degree of clinical urgency, with only a minor proportion required to support elective surgery.","Shortt, Jake; Polizzotto, Mark N; Waters, Neil; Borosak, Marija; Moran, Martine; Comande, Mary; Devine, Alexandra; Jolley, Damien J; Wood, Erica M",Transfusion,277,1

Reperfusion-related injury may contribute to the observed decoupling of angiographic and clinical outcomes. Iatrogenic disruption of the endothelium during thrombectomy is potentially a key mediator of this process that requires further study. METHODS An in vitro live-cell platform was developed to study the effect of various commercially available endovascular devices on the endothelium. In vivo validation was performed using porcine subjects. RESULTS This novel in vitro platform permitted high-resolution quantification and characterization of the pattern and timing of endothelial-cell injury among endovascular thrombectomy devices and vessel diameters. Thrombectomy devices displayed heterogeneous effects on the endothelium; the device performance assessed in vitro was substantiated by in vivo findings. CONCLUSIONS In vitro live-cell artificial vessel modeling enables a detailed study of the endothelium after thrombectomy and may contribute to future device design. Large animal studies confirm the relevance of this in vitro system to investigate endothelial physiology. This artificial vessel model may represent a practical, scalable, and physiologically relevant system to assess new endovascular technologies.","Teng, Dayu; Pannell, Jeffrey Scott; Rennert, Robert C; Li, Jieying; Li, Yi-Shuan; Wong, Victor W; Chien, Shu; Khalessi, Alexander A",Stroke,277,1

During the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, quality improvement metrics at our hospital identified lower rates of CD. We sought to investigate this change and identify factors that may have contributed to the decrease. STUDY DESIGN We compared nulliparous singleton deliveries at a large academic hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic (April through July 2020 during a statewide ""stay-at-home"" order) to those in the same months 1 year prior to the pandemic (April through July 2019). The primary outcome, mode of delivery, was obtained from the electronic medical record system, along with indication for CD. RESULTS The cohort included 1,913 deliveries: 892 in 2019 and 1,021 in 2020. Patient characteristics (age, body mass index, race, ethnicity, and insurance type) did not differ between the groups. Median gestational age at delivery was the same in both groups. The CD rate decreased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with prior (28.9 vs. 33.6%; p = 0.03). There was a significant increase in the rate of labor induction (45.7 vs. 40.6%; p = 0.02), but no difference in the proportion of inductions that were elective (19.5 vs. 20.7%; p = 0.66). The rate of CD in labor was unchanged (15.9 vs. 16.3%; p = 0.82); however, more women attempted a trial of labor (87.0 vs. 82.6%; p = 0.01). Thus, the proportion of CD without a trial of labor decreased (25.1 vs. 33.0%; p = 0.04). CONCLUSION There was a statistically significant decrease in CD during the COVID-19 pandemic at our hospital, driven by a decrease in CD without a trial of labor. The increased rate of attempted trial of labor suggests the presence of patient-level factors that warrant further investigation as potential targets for decreasing CD rates. Additionally, in a diverse and medically complex population, increased rates of labor induction were not associated with increased rates of CD. KEY POINTS · Primary CD rate fell during COVID-19 pandemic.. · Decrease was driven by more women attempting labor.. · Higher rate of induction without rise in CD rate was found..","Sinnott, Colleen M; Freret, Taylor S; Clapp, Mark A; Reiff, Emily; Little, Sarah E",American journal of perinatology,277,33

Because the relevant DUBs for FLT3 are not known, we assembled a focused library of most reported small-molecule DUB inhibitors and carried out a cellular phenotypic screen to identify compounds that could induce the degradation of oncogenic FLT3. Subsequent target deconvolution efforts allowed us to identify USP10 as the critical DUB required to stabilize FLT3. Targeting of USP10 showed efficacy in preclinical models of mutant-FLT3 AML, including cell lines, primary patient specimens and mouse models of oncogenic-FLT3-driven leukemia.","Weisberg, Ellen L; Schauer, Nathan J; Yang, Jing; Lamberto, Ilaria; Doherty, Laura; Bhatt, Shruti; Nonami, Atsushi; Meng, Chengcheng; Letai, Anthony; Wright, Renee; Tiv, Hong; Gokhale, Prafulla C; Ritorto, Maria Stella; De Cesare, Virginia; Trost, Matthias; Christodoulou, Alexandra; Christie, Amanda; Weinstock, David M; Adamia, Sophia; Stone, Richard; Chauhan, Dharminder; Anderson, Kenneth C; Seo, Hyuk-Soo; Dhe-Paganon, Sirano; Sattler, Martin; Gray, Nathanael S; Griffin, James D; Buhrlage, Sara J",Nature chemical biology,277,27

Phylogeographic approaches are currently unable to disentangle the relative effects of these competing factors. We develop a spatiotemporally structured phylogenetic framework that addresses these limitations by considering individual transmission events, reconstructed across spatial scales. We apply it to geocoded dengue virus sequences from Thailand (N = 726 over 18 years). We find infected individuals spend 96% of their time in their home community compared to 76% for the susceptible population (mainly children) and 42% for adults. Dynamic pockets of local immunity make transmission more likely in places with high heterotypic immunity and less likely where high homotypic immunity exists. Age-dependent mixing of individuals and vector distributions are not important in determining spread. This approach provides previously unknown insights into one of the most complex disease systems known and will be applicable to other pathogens.","Salje, Henrik; Wesolowski, Amy; Brown, Tyler S; Kiang, Mathew V; Berry, Irina Maljkovic; Lefrancq, Noemie; Fernandez, Stefan; Jarman, Richard G; Ruchusatsawat, Kriangsak; Iamsirithaworn, Sopon; Vandepitte, Warunee P; Suntarattiwong, Piyarat; Read, Jonathan M; Klungthong, Chonticha; Thaisomboonsuk, Butsaya; Engø-Monsen, Kenth; Buckee, Caroline; Cauchemez, Simon; Cummings, Derek A T",Nature communications,277,1

The aim is to evaluate the rate of AKI, defined according to Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcome guidelines, in a series of critical COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU of a single tertiary teaching hospital. METHODS From April to May 2020, all consecutive critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU who did not meet exclusion criteria (length of ICU stay <48 h, ESRD requiring dialysis, and patients still hospitalized in ICU at the time of data analysis) were enrolled in this study. Patients were stratified according to the highest AKI stage attained during ICU stay. RESULTS Sixty-one patients were included in the analysis. AKI was observed in 35/61 patients (57.4%): 25/35 episodes (71.4%) were observed within the first 7 days. AKI was classified as follows: 17.1% stage 1, 25.7% stage 2, and 57.2% stage 3. Fourteen out of 20 stage-3 patients required continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), mostly related to persistent oliguria. The overall ICU mortality was 68.9%, and it was higher in patients developing AKI if compared to no-AKI patients (p = 0.006). Renal function recovery of any grade was observed in 14 out of 35 AKI patients (40%). Among patients undergoing CRRT, 13 patients were still dialysis dependent at the time of death. CONCLUSION In critical COVID-19 patients, ICU mortality is particularly high, especially in patients developing AKI. An accurate monitoring of renal function in early phases of respiratory failure should be ensured in order to timely apply any strategy aimed at limiting renal complications during ICU stay.","Alessandri, Francesco; Pistolesi, Valentina; Manganelli, Chiara; Ruberto, Franco; Ceccarelli, Giancarlo; Morabito, Santo; Pugliese, Francesco",Blood purification,277,16

We aimed to identify factors contributing to outcome measures in patients treated with the Surpass flow diverter for aneurysms in this location. MATERIALS AND METHODS We conducted an observational study of 53 patients who underwent flow-diverter treatment for posterior circulation aneurysms at 15 centers. Key outcome measures were mortality, complete aneurysm occlusion, and modified Rankin Scale score at follow-up. RESULTS At follow-up (median, 11.3 months; interquartile range, 5.9-12.7 months), 9 patients had died, resulting in an all-cause mortality rate of 17.3% (95% CI, 7%-27.6%); 7 deaths (14%) were directly related to the procedure and none occurred in patients with a baseline mRS score of zero. After adjusting for covariates, a baseline mRS of 3-5 was more significantly (P = .003) associated with a higher hazard ratio for death than a baseline mRS of 0-2 (hazard ratio, 17.11; 95% CI, 2.69-109.02). After adjusting for follow-up duration, a 1-point increase in the baseline mRS was significantly (P < .001) associated with higher values of mRS at follow-up (odds ratio, 2.93; 95% CI, 1.79-4.79).

The IL-1α precursor is constitutively present in nearly all cell types in health, but is released upon necrotic cell death as a bioactive mediator. IL-1α is also expressed by infiltrating myeloid cells within injured tissues. The cytokine binds the IL-1 receptor 1 (IL-1R1), as does IL-1β, and induces the same pro-inflammatory effects. Being a bioactive precursor released upon tissue damage and necrotic cell death, IL-1α is central to the pathogenesis of numerous conditions characterized by organ or tissue inflammation. These include conditions affecting the lung and respiratory tract, dermatoses and inflammatory skin disorders, systemic sclerosis, myocarditis, pericarditis, myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, inflammatory thrombosis, as well as complex multifactorial conditions such as COVID-19, vasculitis and Kawasaki disease, Behcet's syndrome, Sjogren Syndrome, as well as cancer. This review illustrates the clinical relevance of IL-1α to the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases, as well as the rationale for the targeted inhibition of this cytokine for treatment of these conditions. Three biologics are available to reduce the activities of IL-1α; the monoclonal antibody bermekimab, the IL-1 soluble receptor rilonacept, and the IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra.

Online MHGs may be particularly appealing to individuals with limited access or inclination to attend in-person MHGs. We examined engagement within the popular ""StopDrinking"" online MHG, hypothesizing that engagement would increase due to demand for virtual peer support as COVID-19 social distancing progressed. METHODS We collected publicly available engagement data for StopDrinking from February 19, 2018 through April 30, 2020 while considering March and April of 2020 as months initially impacted by voluntary or mandated COVID-19 social distancing. Using seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average models, we predicted daily engagement for this social distancing time period based on all available engagement data collected before April 2020. Kalman filtering with 95% prediction limits was employed to define significant thresholds for observed data to reside within. RESULTS All days of observed engagement in March and April 2020 were lower than corresponding predicted values. Observed engagement fell below the lower 95% prediction limit for 36% of days, with 15 days in March and 7 days in April having significantly lower than predicted engagement. CONCLUSIONS Relatively low activity on StopDrinking may signal broader population trends of problematic alcohol use and recovery disengagement during the initial COVID-19 social distancing timeframe. Continued investigation of online MHGs is needed to understand their potential for monitoring population health trends and to understand how such groups might support alcohol use recovery in contexts of crisis and isolation.","Colditz, Jason B; Rothenberger, Scott D; Liebschutz, Jane M; Rollman, Bruce L; Kraemer, Kevin L",Journal of addiction medicine,277,1

It has been reported in cases of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), as well as in morbidly obese patients with healthy lungs. The authors hypothesized that complete airway closure was highly prevalent in obese ARDS and influenced the calculation of respiratory mechanics. METHODS In a post hoc pooled analysis of two cohorts, ARDS patients were classified according to body mass index (BMI) terciles. Low-flow inflation pressure-volume curve and partitioned respiratory mechanics using esophageal manometry were recorded. The authors' primary aim was to compare the prevalence of complete airway closure according to BMI terciles. Secondary aims were to compare (1) respiratory system mechanics considering or not considering complete airway closure in their calculation, and (2) and partitioned respiratory mechanics according to BMI. RESULTS Among the 51 patients analyzed, BMI was less than 30 kg/m in 18, from 30 to less than 40 in 16, and greater than or equal to 40 in 17. Prevalence of complete airway closure was 41% overall (95% CI, 28 to 55; 21 of 51 patients), and was lower in the lowest (22% [3 to 41]; 4 of 18 patients) than in the highest BMI tercile (65% [42 to 87]; 11 of 17 patients). Driving pressure and elastances of the respiratory system and of the lung were higher when complete airway closure was not taken into account in their calculation. End-expiratory esophageal pressure (ρ = 0.69 [95% CI, 0.48 to 0.82]; P < 0.001), but not chest wall elastance, was associated with BMI, whereas elastance of the lung was negatively correlated with BMI (ρ = -0.27 [95% CI, -0.56 to -0.10]; P = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS Prevalence of complete airway closure was high in ARDS and should be taken into account when calculating respiratory mechanics, especially in the most morbidly obese patients. : WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW ABOUT THIS TOPIC: Plateau and driving pressures have been shown to correlate with mortality in adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, these static airway pressures may not always accurately reflect alveolar pressure.It has recently been recognized that in ARDS, airway closure may occur while some alveoli are still inflated. This may result in a biased estimate of mean alveolar pressure.Complete airway closure can only be measured by the inflection point on the initial portion of a low-flow inflation pressure-volume or pressure-time curve with the absence of cardiac oscillations and very low compliance, most likely in the terminal bronchioles.In 25 to 33% of patients with ARDS, airway opening pressure (the inflection point value) is greater than the total positive end-expiratory pressure measured by an end-expiratory maneuver. WHAT THIS ARTICLE TELLS US THAT IS NEW In a post hoc analysis of two cohort studies of respiratory mechanics in ARDS, the authors compared the prevalence of complete airway closure stratified by body mass index and its effects on respiratory mechanics.Complete airway closure was present in 41% of patients, increasing with body mass index tercile (65% in the highest).Driving pressure and respiratory system elastances (lung, chest wall) were higher when complete airway closure was not adjusted for.","Coudroy, Rémi; Vimpere, Damien; Aissaoui, Nadia; Younan, Romy; Bailleul, Clotilde; Couteau-Chardon, Amélie; Lancelot, Aymeric; Guerot, Emmanuel; Chen, Lu; Brochard, Laurent; Diehl, Jean-Luc",Anesthesiology,277,31

The public health systems have consequently been placed under tremendous pressure. Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are widely used in patients with cancers. Little is known about the provision of PICCs care amongst cancer patients during this pandemic. METHODS We studied 156 cancer patients with PICCs treated at the Cancer Center of the Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University between January 2020 and March 2020. Their clinical characteristics, social features, psychological characteristics, and PICCs care situations were analyzed. The chi-squared (χ2) test or Fisher's exact test were used for univariate analyses. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed using stepwise variable selection. Differences were evaluated using a two-tailed test, and P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS Of 156 patients, 57 (36.5%) experienced delays of PICCs care, and 12 (21.1%) suffered from complications including infection, thrombosis, and mechanical failure. Univariate analysis detected that the increased risk of PICCs care delay was associated with older age (≥30), lower level of education (<9 years), working, taking public transport to the hospital, anxiety about COVID-19, lower social support rating scale (SSRS) score (<30). Multivariate analysis detected level of education, being employed or not, mode of transport, and SSRS score were independent predictive factors for the delay in PICCs care. CONCLUSIONS Physical aspects, social factors, and psychological status commonly influenced patients' health care seeking behaviors such as PICCs maintenance. An increase in effort is required from patients' families and society to assure optimal care for cancer patients during this pandemic.","Hu, Liyang; Tao, Hongmei; Xu, Xiaolu; Chen, Hui; Chang, Kejie; Pei, Xiaofeng; Hao, Fen; He, Lanman; Chen, Yanni; Liang, Zibin; Luo, Tongtong; Lin, Zhong; Lv, Weize; Long, Fengjiao",Annals of palliative medicine,277,17

The development of short-acting anesthetics, advances in surgical techniques, and paradigm shifts accepting targeted hospital admission and preoperative testing have allowed the acceptance of outpatient anesthesia for a wide variety of surgical procedures, including orthognathic procedures. Furthermore, the cost savings associated with office-based surgery and the declining insurance coverage for procedures such as orthognathic surgery have helped to increase the demand for surgery in this setting. The administration of anesthesia for orthognathic surgery in an outpatient setting requires preoperative preparation, preoperative patient assessment and selection, use of short-acting anesthetic agents and techniques, presence of emergency drugs and equipment, appropriate recovery protocols and staff, and the presence of adequate caregivers upon home discharge. Anesthetic techniques and agents allowing multiple orthognathic procedures to be performed in the outpatient setting are described.","Cangemi, Charles F",Journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery : official journal of the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons,277,31

The purpose of this study is to assess patient satisfaction and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) for individuals who underwent follow-up for shoulder surgery using telemedicine compared to those who received traditional in-person clinic follow-up. METHODS Patients who underwent either rotator cuff repair or total shoulder arthroplasty during a designated pre-COVID-19 (traditional clinic follow-up) or peri-COVID-19 (telemedicine follow-up) span of time were identified. PROMs including the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons standardized assessment form, the three-level version of the EQ-5D form, the 12-Item Short Form survey, and a modified version of a published telemedicine survey were administered to participants six months post-operatively via phone call. RESULTS Sixty patients agreed to participate. There was no significant difference between the pre-COVID-19 and peri-COVID-19 groups in patient satisfaction with their follow-up visit (p = 0.289), nor was there a significant difference in PROMs between the two groups. In total, 83.33% of the telemedicine group and 70.37% of the in-person clinic group preferred traditional in-person follow-up over telemedicine. DISCUSSION In a cohort of patients who underwent telemedicine follow-up for shoulder surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic, there was no difference in patient satisfaction and PROMs compared to traditional in-person clinic follow-up. This study indicates that while the majority of participants preferred face-to-face visits, patients were relatively satisfied with their care and had similar functional outcome scores in both groups, despite the large disruption in healthcare logistics caused by COVID-19.","Sabbagh, Ramsey; Shah, Nihar; Jenkins, Sarah; Macdonald, Jacob; Foote, Austin; Matar, Robert; Steffensmeier, Andrew; Grawe, Brian",Journal of telemedicine and telecare,277,29

Macrophages (MФs) are crucial cellular components in the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment. However, the specific effects of M1 MФs or M2 MФs on regulating megakaryocytes (MKs) are largely unknown. In the current study, aberrant BM-M1/M2 MФ polarization, characterized by increased M1 MФs and decreased M2 MФs and accompanied by impaired megakaryopoiesis-supporting abilities, was found in patients with PT post-allotransplant. RNA-seq and western blot analysis showed that the PI3K-AKT pathway was downregulated in the BM MФs of PT patients. Moreover, in vitro treatment with PI3K-AKT activators restored the impaired megakaryopoiesis-supporting ability of MФs from PT patients. Furthermore, we found M1 MФs suppress, whereas M2 MФs support MK maturation and platelet formation in humans. Chemical inhibition of PI3K-AKT pathway reduced megakaryopoiesis-supporting ability of M2 MФs, as indicated by decreased MK count, colony-forming unit number, high-ploidy distribution, and platelet count. Importantly, genetic knockdown of the PI3K-AKT pathway impaired the megakaryopoiesis-supporting ability of MФs both in vitro and in a MФ-specific PI3K-knockdown murine model, indicating a critical role of PI3K-AKT pathway in regulating the megakaryopoiesis-supporting ability of M2 MФs. Furthermore, our preliminary data indicated that TGF-β released by M2 MФs may facilitate megakaryopoiesis through upregulation of the JAK2/STAT5 and MAPK/ERK pathways in MKs. Taken together, our data reveal that M1 and M2 MФs have opposing effects on MKs in a PI3K-AKT pathway-dependent manner, which may lead to new insights into the pathogenesis of thrombocytopenia and provide a potential therapeutic strategy to promote megakaryopoiesis.","Zhao, Hong-Yan; Zhang, Yuan-Yuan; Xing, Tong; Tang, Shu-Qian; Wen, Qi; Lyu, Zhong-Shi; Lv, Meng; Wang, Yu; Xu, Lan-Ping; Zhang, Xiao-Hui; Kong, Yuan; Huang, Xiao-Jun",Signal transduction and targeted therapy,277,17

Airway management in these patients is challenging and direct laryngoscopy is the standard of care. Videolaryngoscopes like the ET-View were introduced into clinical practice to provide better airway visualization and ease intubation. The ET-View is essentially a conventional endotracheal tube, but is equipped with a miniature camera on the tip. The ET-View has not been investigated in patients with immobilized cervical spine so far. The aim was to evaluate the performance of the VivaSight SL compared with Macintosh when performed in patients with immobilized cervical spine by unexperienced physicians. METHODS This was prospective, randomized, cross-over manikin trial. 50 novice physicians were randomly assigned to intubate a manikin in three airway scenarios including a normal airway and two cervical immobilization techniques. Overall and first intubation attempt success rate, time to intubation, dental compression and airway visualization according to the Cormack&Lehane graduation were assessed. RESULTS All physicians were able to intubate the manikin in all scenarios using the ETView, whereas direct laryngoscopy failed in 16 % with immobilized cervical spine using the patriot cervical extraction collar. First intubation attempt success rate was higher and airway visualization was better in all three scenarios using the ET-View compared to direct laryngoscopy. CONCLUSION The ET-View offered much better 62 airway visualization and provided higher overall and first intubation attempt success rates. Therefore, the ET-View is a valuable alternative in patients with difficult intubation due to immobilized cervical spine. Further clinical trials are indicated to confirm these findings.

We therefore adapted the (123)I-MIBG imaging procedure in small animals to allow quantification of both global and regional uptake and wash-out rate using high specific activity (123)I-MIBG in the myocardium of rats. After evaluation of the image procedure in normal animals, we then applied our imaging protocol to visualize the regional dysinnervation in cardiac autonomic neuropathy occurring in streptozotocin-induced diabetes. METHODS Seven normal Lewis rats underwent (123)I-MIBG pinhole SPECT with low specific activity (123)I-MIBG (lsa MIBG) and high specific activity (123)I-MIBG (hsa MIBG) with a 2 week interval. Twelve normal rats and 12 rats 8 weeks after streptozotocin injection underwent the same hsa MIBG imaging protocol. The imaging protocol consisted of two SPECT acquisitions for every animal. The imaging sequence started at 20 min after tracer injection. The percentage of injected activity (%IA) and the wash-out rate in the global myocardium were measured. Left ventricular regional MIBG kinetics were analyzed in the six midventricular segments of the 17 segment model. RESULTS Compared with lsa MIBG, the wash-out rate of hsa MIBG was significantly slower, in association with a higher cardiac uptake. Regional analysis showed a maximal uptake in the anterolateral segment, without significant differences between segments. We noted a significantly higher global wash-out rate in the streptozotocin group compared to controls (p < 0.05). Regional analysis confirmed the increased wash-out rate, reaching statistical significance in the inferior and the inferoseptal walls. CONCLUSION High-quality (123)I-MIBG images and accurate measurements can be obtained using hsa (123)I-MIBG with image acquisitions performed at relatively early time points. Small animal MIBG SPECT imaging allows for regional analysis of the myocardium. In the streptozotocin group, wash-out of MIBG is globally increased, compatible with a higher sympathetic tonus or decreased reuptake of MIBG. The highest increase is located in the inferior, inferoseptal and anteroseptal walls. These findings further suggest the occurrence of diabetic cardiomyopthy after streptozotocin injection.","Goethals, Lode R; Weytjens, Caroline D; De Geeter, Frank; Droogmans, Steven; Caveliers, Vicky; Keyaerts, Marleen; Vanhove, Chris; Van Camp, Guy; Bossuyt, Axel; Lahoutte, Tony",Contrast media & molecular imaging,277,32

This paper examines specific ethical criteria that would permit union action, including a desire to ameliorate patient care as well as the goal of improving the conditions of working physicians. We posit that traditional rebuttals to physician unionisation often lean on an infinite conception of a doctor's energies and obligations, one that promotes burnout and serves to advance the financial motives of hospital management and administration. Furthermore, this paper explores the empirical justifications for collective action, which include substantial reductions in medical error. Finally, we address the free-rider problem posed by non-union physicians who might benefit from working improvements garnered through union action. We conclude that in order to maintain a notion of justice as fairness, resident physicians who benefit from union deliberations are impelled to acquire union membership or make a commensurate donation and that the healthcare organisations for which they work ought to share in the responsibility to improve patient care.","Byju, Arjun S; Mayo, Kajsa",Journal of medical ethics,277,31

The laboratory processing of biopsied testicular tissues needs to be performed meticulously to acquire a high yield of cells. In this study, the effectiveness of mincing the tissues after testicular biopsy was assessed using histological evaluation, as was the possible adverse effect of residual tissue on the migration of spermatogenic cells during density gradient centrifugation. Our results indicate that testicular residual tissue, when laid on the density gradient medium along with the sperm wash, hinders the spermatogenic cells' forming a pellet during centrifugation, and therefore impairs the intracytoplasmic sperm injection procedure. Whereas the mean number of recovered cells from the sperm wash medium (SWM) with residual tissue is 39.435 ± 24.849, it was notably higher (60.189 ± 28.214 cells) in the SWM without minced tissues. The remaining tissue contained no functional seminiferous tubules or spermatogenic cells in histological sections. In conclusion, the remaining residual tissue after mincing biopsied testicular tissue does not add any functional or cellular contribution to spermatogenic cell retrieval; in fact, it may block the cellular elements in the accompanying cell suspension from migrating through the gradient layers to form a pellet during centrifugation and cause loss of spermatogenic cells.","Ozkavukcu, Sinan; Ibis, Ebru; Kizil, Sule; Isbacar, Suheyla; Aydos, Kaan",Asian journal of andrology,277,33

Models have focused primarily on the reproductive numbers of the disease that represent the average number of secondary infections produced by a random infectious individual. However, these population-level estimates may conflate important systematic variation in the number of cases generated by infected individuals, particularly found in spatially localized transmission and superspreading events. Although superspreading features prominently in first-hand narratives of Ebola transmission, its dynamics have not been systematically characterized, hindering refinements of future epidemic predictions and explorations of targeted interventions. We used Bayesian model inference to integrate individual-level spatial information with other epidemiological data of community-based (undetected within clinical-care systems) cases and to explicitly infer distribution of the cases generated by each infected individual. Our results show that superspreaders play a key role in sustaining onward transmission of the epidemic, and they are responsible for a significant proportion ([Formula: see text]61%) of the infections. Our results also suggest age as a key demographic predictor for superspreading. We also show that community-based cases may have progressed more rapidly than those notified within clinical-care systems, and most transmission events occurred in a relatively short distance (with median value of 2.51 km). Our results stress the importance of characterizing superspreading of Ebola, enhance our current understanding of its spatiotemporal dynamics, and highlight the potential importance of targeted control measures.","Lau, Max S Y; Dalziel, Benjamin Douglas; Funk, Sebastian; McClelland, Amanda; Tiffany, Amanda; Riley, Steven; Metcalf, C Jessica E; Grenfell, Bryan T",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,277,11

However, bone mineral density does not account for all the fragility fractures, being a part of them attributable to impairment in bone quality. Aim of this study is to assess the usefulness of DXA-derived geometry and structural indexes in the assessment of bone status in mastocytosis. Ninety-six consecutive patients (46 women and 50 men) affected by cutaneous (CM) or systemic (SM) mastocytosis were studied. Mean age (± SD) was 53.3 ± 14.23. Spine lateral X-rays for Genant's scale, DXA for lumbar (L) and femoral (F) bone mineral density (BMD), bone strain index (BSI), lumbar trabecular bone score (TBS), and hip structural analysis (HSA) were performed. Among the laboratory variables, data of serum tryptase were reported. Tryptase was higher in SM (p = 0.035), inversely correlated with LBMD (r = - 0.232; p = 0.022) and TBS (r = - 0.280; p = 0.005), and directly with L-BSI (r = 0.276; p = 0.006). L-BSI remained statistically significant (p = 0.006; adjusted R2 = 0.101) together with mastocytosis (SM or CM: p = 0.034) in the multivariate regression model with tryptase as dependent variable, being LBMD and TBS not statistically significant (p = 0.887, and p = 0.245, respectively). Tryptase increased about 22 units for each unit increase of L-BSI and about 18 units for SM against CM. L-BSI was lower (p = 0.012), while FN-BSI and FT-BSI were higher in women (p < 0.001) than in men. HSA indexes were significantly higher in men, particularly with SM. SM is a risk factor for reduced bone mass, texture and strength. Since mean L-BSI and Z-modulus of all the femoral sites are statistically higher in men than in female, it could be argued that men have a better femoral bone resistance to bending forces than women, but a worse lumbar bone resistance to compressive loads. DXA indexes of bone quality are useful in mastocytosis' bone assessment and its clinical management.","Ulivieri, Fabio Massimo; Rinaudo, Luca; Piodi, Luca Petruccio; Barbieri, Valentina; Marotta, Giorgio; Sciumè, Mariarita; Grifoni, Federica Irene; Cesana, Bruno Mario",Calcified tissue international,277,1

Otolaryngologists caring for children commonly depend on physical examination, laboratory data, and ambulatory surgical procedures. Limiting patient care, mindful allocation of resources, and concern for safety have challenged all aspects of our health care system. This evidence-based clinical consensus is designed to guide practitioners of pediatric otolaryngology for common scenarios during this time. DATA SOURCES Peer-reviewed literature, published reports, institutional guidelines, and expert consensus. REVIEW METHODS A clinical consensus on 6 common scenarios in pediatric otolaryngology developed with evidence-based strategies. CONCLUSIONS Providers should suspend all in-person nonessential office visits and elective surgical procedures. An emphasis on medical management and caregiver education will provide reasonable approaches to many of the common outpatient concerns. Surgery for chronic otitis media, obstructive sleep apnea, and acute rhinosinusitis should occur only in response to severe complications or failure of medical regimens. The approach to the pediatric neck mass focuses on timely management for oncologic etiologies and cautious surgical intervention for abscess drainage or tissue sampling. Finally, epistaxis and otorrhea must be triaged and addressed without the usual ambulatory procedures. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE Adaptation of practice patterns during this unprecedented moment for our health care system requires thoughtful planning. The strategies described allow for safe handling of common pediatric otolaryngology diagnoses. Ultimately, otolaryngologists must be stewards of our global health community while advocating for the care of individual pediatric patients.","Chorney, Stephen R; Elden, Lisa M; Giordano, Terri; Kazahaya, Ken; Rizzi, Mark D; Zur, Karen B; Dedhia, Kavita",Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,277,16

We have previously developed a novel electrospun bilayered vascular scaffold that provides proper biological and biomechanical properties as well as structural configuration. In this study, we investigated the clinical feasibility of a cellularized vascular scaffold in a preclinical large animal model. We fabricated the cellularized vascular construct with autologous endothelial progenitor cell (EPC)-derived endothelial cells (ECs) and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) followed by a pulsatile bioreactor preconditioning. This fully cellularized vascular construct was tested in a sheep carotid arterial interposition model. After preconditioning, confluent and mature EC and SMC layers in the scaffold were achieved. The cellularized constructs sustained the structural integrity with a high degree of graft patency without eliciting an inflammatory response over the course of the 6-month period in sheep. Moreover, the matured EC coverage on the lumen and a thick smooth muscle layer were formed at 6months after transplantation. We demonstrated that electrospun bilayered vascular scaffolds in conjunction with autologous vascular cells may be a clinically applicable alternative to traditional prosthetic vascular graft substitutes. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE This study demonstrates the utility of tissue engineering to provide platform technologies for rehabilitation of patients recovering from severe, devastating cardiovascular diseases. The long-term goal is to provide alternatives to vascular grafting using bioengineered blood vessels derived from an autologous cell source with a functionalized vascular scaffold. This novel bilayered vascular construct for engineering blood vessels is designed to offer ""off-the-shelf"" availability for clinical translation.","Ju, Young Min; Ahn, Hyunhee; Arenas-Herrera, Juan; Kim, Cheil; Abolbashari, Mehran; Atala, Anthony; Yoo, James J; Lee, Sang Jin",Acta biomaterialia,277,1

Standardized submission data and test results were used. Historical data (2015-2017) composed of the weekly percentage of PCR-positive submissions were used to fit a cyclic robust regression model. The findings were used to forecast the expected weekly percentage of PCR-positive submissions, with a 95% confidence interval (CI), for 2018. During 2018, the proportion of PRRSV-positive submissions crossed 95% CI boundaries at week 2, 14-25, and 48. The relatively higher detection on week 2 and 48 were mostly from submissions containing samples from wean-to-market pigs, and for week 14-25 originated mostly from samples from adult/sow farms. There was a recurring yearly pattern of detection, wherein an increased proportion of PRRSV RNA detection in submissions originating from wean-to-finish farms was followed by increased detection in samples from adult/sow farms. Results from the model described herein confirm the seasonal cyclic pattern of PRRSV detection using test results consolidated from 4 VDLs. Wave crests occurred consistently during winter, and wave troughs occurred consistently during the summer months. Our model was able to correctly identify statistically significant outbreak signals in PRRSV RNA detection at 3 instances during 2018.","Trevisan, Giovani; Linhares, Leticia C M; Crim, Bret; Dubey, Poonam; Schwartz, Kent J; Burrough, Eric R; Wang, Chong; Main, Rodger G; Sundberg, Paul; Thurn, Mary; Lages, Paulo T F; Corzo, Cesar A; Torrison, Jerry; Henningson, Jamie; Herrman, Eric; Hanzlicek, Gregg A; Raghavan, Ram; Marthaler, Douglas; Greseth, Jon; Clement, Travis; Christopher-Hennings, Jane; Muscatello, David; Linhares, Daniel C L","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",277,5

Their administration is well accepted by the majority of patients because ODF dissolve upon in contact with the saliva in the oral cavity without need of water intake. ODF application in personalized pharmacotherapy is currently being exploited. Moreover, innovative preparation methods and characterization technologies have been evolving in recent years, highlighting promising future both from the technological and clinical standpoints. However, the key obstacles to the attainment of full potentials of ODF in the pharmaceutical field is the lack of harmonized and well-defined quality characterization procedures, standard evaluation parameters, guidance on appropriate final product properties and specifications. This review provides an appraisal on the ODF characterization methods from slurries to the finished medicinal products with a specific focus on the technologies suitable for identification, quantification, and quality evaluation of extemporaneously prepared ODF on small batches in individualized pharmacotherapy. Generally, there is a paradigm shift from the use of the conventional quality evaluation tools and/or protocols for oral solid dosage forms to characterize ODF to more specific equipment and procedures that suit the peculiarities of the ODF.","Khalid, Garba M; Selmin, Francesca; Musazzi, Umberto M; Gennari, Chiara G M; Minghetti, Paola; Cilurzo, Francesco",Current drug delivery,277,14

RNA interference (RNAi) induced by small interfering RNA (siRNA) has become a powerful new means to inhibit viral infection in a gene-specific manner. However, the efficacy of the siRNA delivery platform and the relatively high cost of administration have hindered widespread application of siRNA. In this study, we developed a microRNA (miRNA)-30-based lentivirus delivery system by embedding a synthetic short hairpin RNA (shRNA) stem into the context of endogenous precursor of miRNA-30 (shRNAmir) to express a silencer of the influenza gene. We showed that the miRNA-based lentivirus vector was able to express and process a single nucleoprotein (NP)-targeting shRNAmir, which could potently inhibit IAV replication. We further showed that miRNA-based lentivirus vector carrying tandemly linked NP and polymerase PB1 shRNAmirs could express and process double shRNAmirs. Despite the relatively low levels of NP and PB1 miRNAs produced in the stably transduced cells, the combination of two miRNAs exerted a great degree of inhibition on influenza infection. Given the advantage of combinatorial RNAi in preventing emergence of mutant virus, miRNA-based lentiviral vectors are valuable tools for anitiviral activities. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating that a miRNA-based RNAi strategy can be applied for better control of influenza virus infection.","Xu, Fang; Liu, Guanqun; Liu, Qiang; Zhou, Yan",The Journal of general virology,277,1

The current mixed-methods study takes a new look at the topic, combining qualitative and quantitative strategies to identify the social representations of media reception in a sector of the Colombian population during social isolation in the COVID-19 pandemic. The results indicate that these representations vary and are associated with the media channel and the effect the reception produces on mood and mental health. A total of 80 interviews and 1,068 online survey forms were applied in different regions of Colombia. The qualitative phase showed that the programs or messages received were represented positively when they came from audiovisual entertainment and contributed to the family unit and reduced stress during the lockdown. Meanwhile, media reception was represented negatively when the messages or news came from journalism or social networks and increased the misinformation, anxiety, and fear of contagion. The quantitative phase found that media reception decreased as the lockdown continued, due to information saturation and the proliferation of news emphasizing the risks of COVID-19. The results reveal the need to focus health communication on the development of information skills that allow people to learn and assess the veracity and relevance of information received during the pandemic.","Garcés-Prettel, Miguel; Navarro-Díaz, Luis Ricardo; Jaramillo-Echeverri, Luis Guillermo; Santoya-Montes, Yanin",Cadernos de saude publica,277,19

The incidence of the pathology increases with growing age after 65 years. Conventional surgical aortic valve replacement through median sternotomy has been the gold standard of patient care for symptomatic aortic valve stenosis. However, as the risk profile of patients worsens, other therapeutic strategies have been introduced in an attempt to maintain the excellent results obtained by the established surgical treatment. One of these approaches is represented by transcatheter aortic valve implantation. Although the outcomes of high-risk patients undergoing treatment for symptomatic aortic valve stenosis have improved with transcatheter aortic valve replacement, many patients with this condition remain candidates for surgical aortic valve replacement. In order to reduce the surgical trauma in patients who are candidates for surgical aortic valve replacement, minimally invasive approaches have garnered interest during the past decade. Since the introduction of right anterior thoracotomy for aortic valve replacement in 1993, right anterior mini-thoracotomy and upper hemi-sternotomy have become the predominant incisional approaches among cardiac surgeons performing minimal access aortic valve replacement. Beside the location of the incision, the arterial cannulation site represents the second major landmark of minimal access techniques for aortic valve replacement. The two most frequently used arterial cannulation sites include central aortic and peripheral femoral approaches. With the purpose of reducing surgical trauma in these patients, we have opted for a right anterior mini-thoracotomy approach with a central aortic cannulation site. This protocol describes in detail a technique for minimally invasive aortic valve replacement and provides recommendations for patient selection criteria, including cardiac computer tomography measurements. The indications and limitations of this technique, as well as its alternatives, are discussed.","Tavakoli, Reza; Leprince, Pascal; Gassmann, Max; Jamshidi, Peiman; Yamani, Nassrin; Amour, Julien; Lebreton, Guillaume",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,277,1

This study aimed to investigate the safety and the effectiveness of the anastomosis created with the Niti CAR 27 in a laparoscopic anterior resection for sigmoid colon cancer. METHODS In a single-center study, 157 consecutive patients who received an operation between March 2010 and December 2011 were retrospectively assessed. The Niti CAR 27 (CAR group, 63 patients) colorectal anastomoses were compared with the conventional double-stapled (CDS group, 94 patients) colorectal anastomoses. Intraoperative, immediate postoperative and 6-month follow-up data were recorded. RESULTS There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in terms of age, gender, tumor location and other clinical characteristics. One patient (1.6%) in the CAR group and 2 patients (2.1%) in the CDS group experienced complications of anastomotic leakage (P = 0.647). These three patients underwent a diverting loop ileostomy. There were 2 cases (2.1%) of bleeding at the anastomosis site in the CDS group. All patients underwent a follow-up colonoscopy (median, 6 months). One patient in the CAR group experienced anastomotic stricture (1.6% vs. 0%; P = 0.401). This complication was solved by using balloon dilatation. CONCLUSION Anastomosis using the Niti CAR 27 device in a laparoscopic anterior resection for sigmoid colon cancer is safe and feasible.

Most recently, we have developed a RABV-based ebolavirus (EBOV) vaccine that is efficacious in nonhuman primates. One safety feature of this vaccine is the utilization of a live but replication-deficient RABV construct. In this construct, the RABV glycoprotein (G) has been deleted from the genome, requiring G trans complementation in order for new infectious viruses to be released from the initial infected cell. Here we analyze this safety feature of the bivalent RABV-based EBOV vaccine comprised of the G-deleted RABV backbone expressing EBOV glycoprotein (GP). We found that, while the level of RABV genome in infected cells is equivalent regardless of G supplementation, the production of infectious virus is indeed restricted by the lack of G, and most importantly, that the presence of EBOV GP does not substitute for G. These findings further support the safety profile of this replication-deficient RABV-EBOV bivalent vaccine.","Papaneri, Amy B; Bernbaum, John G; Blaney, Joseph E; Jahrling, Peter B; Schnell, Matthias J; Johnson, Reed F",Virus research,277,26

Suture or tack fixation can be technically difficult, and serious cardiovascular complications have been reported. Fibrin sealant (FS) offers a potential solution to this problem. We hypothesized that FS provides comparable mesh fixation to suture repair during laparoscopic mesh hiatoplasty. STUDY DESIGN Using a porcine model, laparoscopic hiatal hernia repair was performed with suture reapproximation of the crura and reinforcement with an acellular porcine dermal matrix. Prior to repair, animals were randomized to mesh fixation with sutures (S) or FS. After 30-day survival, an esophagram was performed, the diaphragm harvested, and mesh position, fixation, and incorporation were evaluated histologically and biomechanically using a T-peel test. RESULTS Twenty (10 S and 10 FS) laparoscopic hiatal hernia repairs were performed. Total operative time was significantly less in the FS group (74.7 versus 127.0 min, p < 0.01). There were no instances of mesh migration in any animal. Mean peel force did not differ significantly between the S and FS groups (0.21 vs. 0.18 N/mm, respectively; p = 0.49). There was no significant difference in cellular repopularization or inflammatory changes around the mesh. CONCLUSIONS Fibrin sealant offers a reasonable alternative to suturing biologic mesh during laparoscopic hiatal hernia repair with equivalent mesh fixation. At 30 days it provides adhesive strength similar to suture fixation, while significantly reducing operative time.","Krpata, David M; Blatnik, Jeffrey A; Harth, Karem C; Phillips, Melissa S; Novitsky, Yuri W; Rosen, Michael J",Surgical endoscopy,277,1

Methods. Forty patients were intubated using tracheal tubes with either HVLP (n = 20; HVLP group) or taper-shaped (n = 20; Taper group) cuffs. Initial cuff pressure was adjusted to 15, 20, or 25 cmH2O in the neutral position. Cuff pressure was evaluated after changing the head and neck positions to flexion, extension, and rotation. Results. Cuff pressure significantly increased with flexion in both HVLP and Taper groups at all initial cuff pressures. It significantly increased with extension in the HVLP group, but not in the Taper group. Cuff pressure did not significantly differ with rotation in either group and was significantly smaller in the Taper group during flexion and extension than in the HVLP group, regardless of initial cuff pressure. Conclusion. Cuff pressure changes with head and neck flexion and extension were smaller in the Taper group than in the HVLP group. Our results highlight the potential for taper cuffs to prevent excessive cuff pressure increases with positional changes in the head and neck.

Whereas this longstanding viewpoint has its genesis in the discovery of the original namesake prions as causative agents of several complex diseases, the underlying assumption of a strict disease basis for prions could not be further from the truth. Prions and the spectrum of functions they comprise, likely represent one of the largest paradigm shifts concerning molecular-encoded phenotypic diversity since identification of DNA as the principle molecule of heredity. The ability of prions to recruit similar proteins to alternate conformations may engender a reservoir of diversity supplementing the genetic diversity resulting from stochastic mutations of DNA and subsequent natural selection. Here we present several currently known prions and how many of their functions as well as modes of transmission are intricately linked to adaptation from an evolutionary perspective. Further, the stability of some prion conformations across generations indicates that heritable prion-based adaptation is a reality.","Dixson, Jamie D; Azad, Rajeev K",Journal of molecular evolution,277,5

Nitrous oxide (N(2)O) has the advantages of being a sedative agent that does not require a painful injection and that offers shallower levels of sedation and a rapid recovery of mental state. We evaluated the clinical usefulness of N(2)O compared with intravenous ketamine when used for the repair of lacerations in children in the ED. METHODS From January to December 2009, we performed a prospective, randomized study at a single academic ED enrolling pediatric patients aged 3 to 10 years who needed primary repair of a laceration wound. The primary outcome was recovery time, which was defined as the time from completion of procedure to recovery of mental state. Other outcomes were sedation depth, pain scale, adverse effects, and satisfaction with sedation. RESULTS There were 32 children who were randomly assigned. Recovery times were shorter in the N(2)O group compared with those in the ketamine group (median [interquartile range (IQR)], 0.0 minutes, [0.0-4.0 minutes] vs 21.5 minutes [12.5-37.5 minutes], P < 0.05). Sedation levels were deeper in the ketamine group than in the N2O group, but pain scales were comparable between groups. No difference was observed in the satisfaction scores by physicians, parents, or nurses. CONCLUSIONS Nitrous oxide inhalation was preferable to injectable ketamine for pediatric patients because it is safe, allows for a faster recovery, maintains sufficient sedation time, and does not induce unnecessarily deep sedation.","Lee, Jin Hee; Kim, Kyuseok; Kim, Tae Yun; Jo, You Hwan; Kim, Seung Ho; Rhee, Joong Eui; Heo, Chan Yeong; Eun, Seok-Chan",Pediatric emergency care,277,26

We measured the interactions of [(99m)Tc(CO)(3)-ibogaine](+) and (99m)Tc-tricarbonyl with the main BBB efflux transporters P-gp and BCRP in vitro and in vivo. Ibogaine was radiolabeled (yield: over 95%).

The CNS tracer [(99m)Tc-HMPAO](0) entered the brain approximately 70-times higher than [(99m)Tc(CO)(3)-ibogaine](+). In vitro studies revealed that neither [(99m)Tc(CO)(3)-ibogaine](+) nor (99m)Tc-tricarbonyl ion were substrates for P-gp or BCRP. But lowering the membrane dipole potential barrier with phloretin enhanced the brain transport of [(99m)Tc(OH(2))(3)(CO)(3)](+) approximately 3-fold. Thus, ibogaine directly labeled with (99m)Tc-tricarbonyl is not suitable for CNS imaging because of its poor uptake. Brain transport is not restricted by efflux transporters but is reduced by its lipophilicity and interaction with the membrane-positive dipole potential.","Tournier, Nicolas; André, Pascal; Blondeel, Sandy; Rizzo-Padoin, Nathalie; du Moulinet d'Hardemarre, Amaury; Declèves, Xavier; Scherrmann, Jean-Michel; Cisternino, Salvatore",Journal of pharmaceutical sciences,277,1

Although this tool does not replace a medical examination, during Covid-19 pandemic, it reduces the spread of infection and avoids the need for a patient's visit. It is useful in the management of chronic disorders or for patients undergoing palliative treatment. The University Hospital of Palermo has applied this in cases of chronic illness caring for patients who cannot stop their treatment, such as Department of Onco-Haematology, Internal Medicine, Dermatology, etc. The Department of Legal Medicine of Palermo, in particular, is also using telemedicine to manage medico-legal sudden natural death investigations and dealing with the Public Prosecutor's office of Palermo. Even after the Covid-19 emergency, telemedicine will be essential to streamline outpatient visits, while at the same time limiting costs, with significant benefits for the Italian National Public Health Service budget. In conclusion, telemedicine can offer a valuable support to the doctor's activity by streamlining and facilitating their work. In this sense, the Covid-19 pandemic represents a positive input for the acceleration and enhancement of these tools.","Perrone, Giuseppe; Zerbo, Stefania; Bilotta, Clio; Malta, Ginevra; Argo, Antonella",The Medico-legal journal,277,22

Here, we show that the twist angle can be used to control the spin-valley properties of transition metal dichalcogenide bilayers by changing the momentum alignment of the valleys in the two layers. Specifically, we observe that the interlayer excitons in twisted WSe_{2}/WSe_{2} bilayers exhibit a high (>60%) degree of circular polarization (DOCP) and long valley lifetimes (>40 ns) at zero electric and magnetic fields. The valley lifetime can be tuned by more than 3 orders of magnitude via electrostatic doping, enabling switching of the DOCP from ∼80% in the n-doped regime to <5% in the p-doped regime. These results open up new avenues for tunable chiral light-matter interactions, enabling novel device schemes that exploit the valley degree of freedom.","Scuri, Giovanni; Andersen, Trond I; Zhou, You; Wild, Dominik S; Sung, Jiho; Gelly, Ryan J; Bérubé, Damien; Heo, Hoseok; Shao, Linbo; Joe, Andrew Y; Mier Valdivia, Andrés M; Taniguchi, Takashi; Watanabe, Kenji; Lončar, Marko; Kim, Philip; Lukin, Mikhail D; Park, Hongkun",Physical review letters,277,19

Here, we report a newly developed LFA-NanoSuit method (LNSM) combined with a desktop scanning electron microscope (SEM) for the direct observation of immunocomplexes labeled with a colloidal metal instead of signal enhancement strategies, such as using color, electrochemical signals, silver enhancement, magnetic properties, luminescent, and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). The proposed LNSM suppresses cellulose deformity, thereby allowing the acquisition of high-resolution images of gold/platinum-labeled immunocomplexed pathogens such as influenza A, without conductive treatment as in conventional SEM. Electron microscopy-based diagnosis of influenza A exhibited 94 % clinical sensitivity (29/31; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 79.3-98.2 %) and 100 % clinical specificity (95 % CI: 98.1-100 %), which was more sensitive (71.4 %) than visual detection (14.3 %), especially in the lower influenza A-RNA copy number group. The detection ability of our method was nearly comparable to that of real-time reverse transcription-PCR. This is the first report on the diagnosis of clinical diseases using LFA equipped with a desktop SEM. This simple and highly sensitive quantitative analysis method involving LFA can be used to diagnose various diseases in humans and livestock, including highly infectious diseases such as COVID-19.","Kawasaki, Hideya; Suzuki, Hiromi; Maekawa, Masato; Hariyama, Takahiko",Journal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis,277,16

The complexity arises from the dioxin and furan molecules with substitutions at positions 2, 3, 7, and 8, which are toxicologically relevant but are not easily separated from the other non-/less toxic congeners. Many regulatory methods require the use of two columns with different polarities or selectivity for dioxin analysis. The most common confirmation column pair is a (5% phenyl)-methylpolysiloxane and a (biscyanopropyl-/ cyanopropylphenyl)-methylpolysiloxane. These phases are required in USEPA-1613 for 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzofuran specificity. However, other column phases, such as the Rxi-17SilMS and the Rtx-Dioxin2, offer alternatives to the traditional column pairing and provide a similar or better separation of 2,3,7,8-substituted congeners. This study compares four columns for dioxin analysis: the Rtx-Dioxin2, Rxi-17SilMS, Rxi-5SilMS, and Rtx-2330. All columns used in this study are capable of meeting the requirements for dioxin analysis required by USEPA-1613.

They are often unaddressed due to underreporting, the inability of peer reviewers and editors to detect them, and editors' reluctance to publish corrections about them. In this paper, we propose a new tool that could be used to tackle their circulation. Methods We provide a review of available data about inaccurate citations and analytically explore current ways of reporting and dealing with these inaccuracies. Consequently, we make a distinction between publication (i.e., first occurrence) and circulation (i.e., reuse) of inaccurate citations. Sloppy reading of published items, literature ambiguity and insufficient quality control in the editorial process are identified as factors that contribute to the publication of inaccurate citations. However, reiteration or copy-pasting without checking the validity of citations, paralleled with lack of resources/motivation to report/correct inaccurate citations contribute to their circulation. Results and discussion We propose the development of an online annotation tool called ""MyCites"" as means with which to mark and map inaccurate citations. This tool allows ORCID users to annotate citations and alert authors (of the cited and citing articles) and also editors of journals where inaccurate citations are published. Each marked citation would travel with the digital version of the document (persistent identifiers) and be visible on websites that host peer-reviewed articles (journals' websites, Pubmed, etc.). In the future development of MyCites, challenges such as the conditions of correct/incorrect-ness and parties that should adjudicate that, and, the issue of dealing with incorrect reports need to be addressed.","Hosseini, Mohammad; Eve, Martin Paul; Gordijn, Bert; Neylon, Cameron",Research integrity and peer review,277,11

Concussion or traumatic brain injury is a challenging condition where preinjury factors may interact to affect recovery. The association between ACEs and traumatic brain injury/concussion is not well mapped in any previous reviews of the literature. Using a scoping review methodology, the research question that will be addressed is: what is known from the existing literature about the association between ACEs and traumatic brain injury/concussion in adults? METHODS AND ANALYSIS The methodological frameworks outlined by Arksey and O'Malley and Levac et al will be used. All original studies in English published since 2007 investigating ACEs and traumatic brain injury/concussion outcomes will be included with no limitations on study type. Literature search strategies will be developed using medical subject headings and text words related to ACEs and traumatic brain injury/concussions. Multiple electronic databases will be searched. Two independent reviewers will screen titles and abstracts for full-text review and full texts for final inclusion. Two independent reviewers will extract data on study characteristics for ACE exposure and traumatic brain injury/concussion outcomes. Extracted data will be summarised quantitatively using numerical counts and qualitatively using thematic analysis.

METHODS We enrolled 303 consecutive patients of a single naïve HCC that had been treated by RFA at The University of Tokyo Hospital from 1999 to 2004. Recurrence was categorized as either intra- or extra-subsegmental as according to the Couinaud's segment of the original nodule. To assess the relationship between the subsegments of the original and recurrent nodules, we calculated the kappa coefficient. We assessed the risk factors for intra- and extra-subsegmental recurrence independently using univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression. We also assessed the impact of the mode of recurrence on the survival outcome. RESULTS During the follow-up period, 201 patients in our cohort showed tumor recurrence distributed in a total of 340 subsegments. Recurrence was categorized as exclusively intra-subsegmental, exclusively extra-subsegmental, and simultaneously intra- and extra-subsegmental in 40 (20%), 110 (55%), and 51 (25%) patients, respectively. The kappa coefficient was measured at 0.135 (95% CI, 0.079-0.190; P<0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that of the tumor size, AFP value and platelet count were all risk factors for both intra- and extra-subsegmental recurrence. Of the patients in whom recurrent HCC was found to be exclusively intra-subsegmental, extra-subsegmental, and simultaneously intra- and extra-subsegmental, 37 (92.5%), 99 (90.8%) and 42 (82.3%), respectively, were treated using RFA. The survival outcomes after recurrence were similar between patients with an exclusively intra- or extra-subsegmental recurrence.

Few data are available comparing the cost and clinical and angiographic outcomes associated with available techniques. The aim of this study is to compare the cost and efficacy of current endovascular stroke therapies. METHODS A single-center retrospective review was performed of the medical record and hospital financial database of all ischemic stroke cases admitted from 2009 to 2013. Three discrete treatment methodologies used during this time were compared: traditional Penumbra System (PS), stent retriever with local aspiration (SRLA) and A Direct Aspiration first Pass Technique (ADAPT). Statistical analyses of clinical and angiographic outcomes and costs for each group were performed. RESULTS 222 patients (45% men) underwent mechanical thrombectomy. Successful revascularization was defined as Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction (TICI) 2b/3 flow, which was achieved in 79% of cases with PS, 83% of cases with SRLA, and 95% of cases with ADAPT. The average total cost of hospitalization for patients was $51,599 with PS, $54,700 with SRLA, and $33 ,11 with ADAPT (p<0.0001). Average times to recanalization were 88 min with PS, 47 min with SRLA, and 37 min with ADAPT (p<0.0001). Similar rates of good functional outcomes were seen in the three groups (PS 36% vs SRLA 43% vs ADAPT 47%; p=0.4).

We found landscape variables and host gene flow explained significant amounts of variation of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) spread in the WUI, but not in the unbounded region. The most important predictors of viral spread also differed; host spatial proximity, host relatedness, and mountain ranges played a role in FIV spread in the WUI, whereas roads might have facilitated viral spread in the unbounded region.

METHOD Forty patients were randomly divided into two groups: group A (control) and group B (treated with DEX). Plasma concentrations of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were determined in blood samples using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays at five time points: T1 (baseline), T2 (15 minutes after intubation and before the surgery was started), T3 (the end of surgery), T4 (10 minutes after extubation in the post-anesthesia care unit), and T5 (24 hours after the surgery). Changes in bispect (BIS) index, heart rates, and doses of anesthetics used for induction were also recorded. RESULTS Baseline plasma concentrations of BDNF did not differ between group A and group B; 15 minutes after induction, concentrations of plasma BDNF were significantly reduced in group A. Twenty-four hours after surgery, the concentration was still higher in group B than in group A. In contrast, plasma concentrations of BDNF at other time points tested did not differ between the two groups.

Its objective and subjective dimensions are important to distinguish as each stands in a different relation with health. The first aim of the present study is the validation of three scales measuring objective and subjective isolation in an Italian elderly population. The second aim is to analyze subjective and objective social isolation and to appraise their association with health among seniors. METHODS This cross-sectional survey collected data from 306 over 65 s participants. Questionnaires were administered face-to-face by one author and encompassed: social disconnectedness scale; perceived isolation scale; abbreviated Lubben Social Network Scale; measures of general and mental health, and depression. RESULTS The three scales measuring social isolation demonstrated acceptable psychometric properties and validity. Objective and subjective social isolation were not directly associated with physical health, whereas subjective isolation is strongly linked to worse mental health and depression. Higher level of subjective isolation was associated with lower level of physical health through the mediation of mental health. Subjective isolation served as a mediator in the relation between objective isolation and health. Moderation analysis demonstrated that low values of objective isolation predicted high values of mental health but only when subjective isolation was low. None of these relations were moderated by socio-demographic variables. CONCLUSION Subjective and objective isolation are clearly two separate dimensions and the scales validated in this paper showed to be potentially culturally invariant.

Such support may manifest itself via biased recognition of hate crimes. Psychological surveys were conducted in the wakes of mass shootings in the United States, New Zealand, and the Netherlands (total n = 2,332), to test whether factors that typically predict endorsement of violent extremism also predict biased hate crime perceptions. Path analyses indicated a consistent pattern of motivated judgment: hate crime perceptions were directly biased by prejudicial attitudes and indirectly biased by an aggrieved sense of disempowerment and White/Christian nationalism. After the shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, disempowerment-fueled anti-Semitism predicted lower perceptions that the gunman was motivated by hatred and prejudice (study 1). After the shootings that occurred at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, disempowerment-fueled Islamoprejudice similarly predicted lower hate crime perceptions (study 2a). Conversely, after the tram shooting in Utrecht, Netherlands (which was perpetrated by a Turkish-born immigrant), disempowerment-fueled Islamoprejudice predicted higher hate crime perceptions (study 2b). Finally, after the Walmart shooting in El Paso, Texas, hate crime perceptions were specifically biased by an ethnonationalist view of Hispanic immigrants as a symbolic (rather than realistic) threat to America; that is, disempowered individuals deemphasized likely hate crimes due to symbolic concerns about cultural supremacy rather than material concerns about jobs or crime (study 3).

Within the generally favourable TP53wtbas group, detection of TP53 mutations at progression defined a ""converted"" subgroup (TP53mutconv, n = 9) with inferior OS, similar to that of TP53mutbas and shorter than that of patients remaining TP53 wild-type (TP53wtprogr, 45 vs. 94 months, p = 0.043). Progression-free survival (PFS) under treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) for TP53mutconv was comparable to that of TP53mutbas and also shorter than that of TP53wtprogr cases (5 and 8 vs. 13 months, p = 0.0039). Fewer TP53wtprogr than TP53mutbas or TP53mutconv cases presented with metastatic disease at diagnosis (67% vs. 91% or 100%, p < 0.05). Thus, acquisition of TP53 mutations at progression is associated with more aggressive disease, shorter TKI responses and inferior OS in ALK+ NSCLC, comparable to primary TP53 mutated cases.","Christopoulos, Petros; Dietz, Steffen; Kirchner, Martina; Volckmar, Anna-Lena; Endris, Volker; Neumann, Olaf; Ogrodnik, Simon; Heussel, Claus-Peter; Herth, Felix J; Eichhorn, Martin; Meister, Michael; Budczies, Jan; Allgäuer, Michael; Leichsenring, Jonas; Zemojtel, Tomasz; Bischoff, Helge; Schirmacher, Peter; Thomas, Michael; Sültmann, Holger; Stenzinger, Albrecht",Cancers,277,32

PBNP biodistribution was determined by using SPECT and MRI following intravenous administration into C57BL6 mice. Activity concentrations (MBq/cm3) were calculated from the SPECT scans for each dedicated volume of interest (VOI) of liver, kidneys, salivary glands, heart, lungs, and brain. Results PBNP accumulation peaked at 2 hours after injection predominantly in the kidneys and the liver followed by a gradual decrease in activity in later time points.

Infection-associated inflammation and coagulation promote the progression of adverse outcomes in sepsis. Here, we report that phospho-Tyr705 of STAT3 (pY-STAT3), not total STAT3, contributes to systemic inflammation and coagulopathy in sepsis. METHODS Cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced septic mice were treated with BP-1-102, Napabucasin, or vehicle control respectively and then assessed for systemic inflammation, coagulation response, lung function and survival. Human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs) and Raw264.7 cells were exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with pharmacological or genetic inhibition of pY-STAT3. Cells were assessed for inflammatory and coagulant factor expression, cell function and signaling. RESULTS Pharmacological inhibition of pY-STAT3 expression by BP-1-102 reduced the proinflammatory factors, suppressed coagulation activation, attenuated lung injury, alleviated vascular leakage and improved the survival rate in septic mice. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of pY-STAT3 diminished LPS-induced cytokine production in macrophages and protected pulmonary endothelial cells via the IL-6/JAK2/STAT3, NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways. Moreover, the increase in procoagulant indicators induced by sepsis such as tissue factor (TF), the thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT) and D-Dimer were down-regulated by pY-STAT3 inhibition. CONCLUSIONS Our results revealed a therapeutic role of pY-STAT3 in modulating the inflammatory response and defective coagulation during sepsis.

Here, we present the first usage of near-infrared (NIR) photoacoustic remote sensing (PARS) to achieve imaging contrast from lipids without the need for exogenous stains or labels. In our system, the facile production of 1225 nm excitation pulses is achieved by the stimulated Raman scattering of a 1064 nm source propagating through an optical fiber. PARS-based detection is achieved by monitoring the change in the scattering profile of a co-aligned 1550 nm continuous-wave interrogation beam in response to absorption of the 1225 nm light by lipids. Our non-contact, reflection-mode approach can achieve a FWHM resolution of up to 0.96 µm and signal-to-noise ratios as high as 45 dB from carbon fibers and 9.7 dB from a lipid phantom. NIR-PARS offers a promising approach to image lipid-rich samples with a simplified workflow.","Kedarisetti, Pradyumna; Haven, Nathaniel J M; Restall, Brendon S; Martell, Matthew T; Zemp, Roger J",Optics letters,277,27

Due to individual variations and visual similarities of lesions in shapes, colors, and textures, current clinical methods remain subject to potential high-risk and time-consumption issues. In this paper, we propose an Esophageal Lesion Network (ELNet) for automatic esophageal lesion classification and segmentation using deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs). The underlying method automatically integrates dual-view contextual lesion information to extract global features and local features for esophageal lesion classification and lesion-specific segmentation network is proposed for automatic esophageal lesion annotation at pixel level. For the established clinical large-scale database of 1051 white-light endoscopic images, ten-fold cross-validation is used in method validation. Experiment results show that the proposed framework achieves classification with sensitivity of 0.9034, specificity of 0.9718, and accuracy of 0.9628, and the segmentation with sensitivity of 0.8018, specificity of 0.9655, and accuracy of 0.9462.

It has been found that the amount of abdominal fat may predict grade C postoperative pancreatic fistula. In this study, we analysed the value of retrorenal fat thickness in the prediction of grade C pancreatic fistula. METHODS A total of 140 patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy were retrospectively analysed. Retrorenal fat thickness and intra-abdominal fat, expressed as total fat area, visceral fat area and subcutaneous fat area, were determined from computed tomography slices using the known range of attenuation values (-190 to -30). Blood loss, operating time, pancreatic texture and main pancreatic duct diameter as well as body mass index were also analysed. RESULTS Retrorenal fat thickness (P = 0.0004), duct diameter (P = 0.0008), subcutaneous fat area (P = 0.023) and total fat area (P = 0.014) were found to be significant predictors of grade C pancreatic fistula. CONCLUSION Although retrorenal fat tissue thickness may seem robust, it is a simple measure that can be used to predict the most severe grade of pancreatic fistula after pancreaticoduodenectomy.","Kopljar, Mario; Čoklo, Miran; Krstačić, Antonija; Krstačić, Goran; Jeleč, Vjekoslav; Zovak, Mario; Pavić, Roman; Kondža, Goran",ANZ journal of surgery,277,1

Clinical trial data available thus far have been obtained primarily in patients with resistant hypertension, defined as standardized systolic clinic blood pressure ≥ 160 mm Hg (or ≥ 150 mm Hg in patients with type 2 diabetes) despite appropriate pharmacologic treatment with at least 3 antihypertensive drugs, including a diuretic agent. Accordingly, these criteria and blood pressure thresholds should be borne in mind when selecting patients for renal nerve ablation. Secondary forms of hypertension and pseudoresistance, such as nonadherence to medication, intolerance of medication, and white coat hypertension, should have been ruled out, and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is mandatory in this context. Because there are theoretical concerns with regard to renal safety, selected patients should have preserved renal function, with an estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥ 45 ml/min/1.73 m(2). Optimal periprocedural management of volume status and medication regimens at specialized and experienced centers equipped with adequate infrastructure to cope with potential procedural complications will minimize potential patient risks. Long-term safety and efficacy data are limited to 3 years of follow-up in small patient cohorts, so efforts to monitor treated patients are crucial to define the long-term performance of the procedure. Although renal nerve ablation could have beneficial effects in other conditions characterized by elevated renal sympathetic nerve activity, its potential use for such indications should currently be limited to formal research studies of its safety and efficacy.","Schlaich, Markus P; Schmieder, Roland E; Bakris, George; Blankestijn, Peter J; Böhm, Michael; Campese, Vito M; Francis, Darrel P; Grassi, Guido; Hering, Dagmara; Katholi, Richard; Kjeldsen, Sverre; Krum, Henry; Mahfoud, Felix; Mancia, Giuseppe; Messerli, Franz H; Narkiewicz, Krzysztof; Parati, Gianfranco; Rocha-Singh, Krishna J; Ruilope, Luis M; Rump, Lars C; Sica, Domenic A; Sobotka, Paul A; Tsioufis, Costas; Vonend, Oliver; Weber, Michael A; Williams, Bryan; Zeller, Thomas; Esler, Murray D",Journal of the American College of Cardiology,277,4

The aim of our study is to verify the safety and feasibility of SPES TEP hernia repair and report our initial clinical outcome. METHODS We prospectively collected data of all patients who underwent SPES TEP repair from May 2009 to December 2010. Data regarding patient demographics, type, size and location of hernia, port devices used, type of mesh and fixation, operative time, complications, length of stay and cosmetic results were collected and analyzed. RESULTS A total of 47 patients (36 M, 11 F) underwent 70 SPES TEP hernia repairs; median age was 53 years (range 22-80). 60 % had indirect hernia, 27.5 % direct, 8.5 % pantaloon, 2 % femoral and 2 % recurrent hernias. Mean hernia size was 1.91 ± 0.67 cm. Port devices used include 33 Triport, 12 SILS and 2 SSL. We used anatomical mesh in 20; flat polypropylene in 10 and titanium-coated polypropylene mesh in 17 patients. Fixation of mesh was achieved in 18 patients with absorbable tacks, 8 with titanium tacks, 1 with fibrin glue, and no tack in 20 with anatomical mesh. No conversions occurred and small seroma was reported in 3 (6.3 %) patients. Mean operative time was 96.48 min (range: 50-150). Average hospital stay was 11.8 h (range: 9-26). Median follow-up was 11 months (range 6-18), and no recurrence was noted. 82.6 % patients were very satisfied, and 17.4 % were satisfied with the procedure. CONCLUSION SPES TEP repair is a safe and feasible technique with good patient satisfaction.","Fuentes, M B; Goel, R; Lee-Ong, A C; Cabrera, E B; Lawenko, M; Lopez-Gutierrez, J; Lomanto, D",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,277,1

The optimal stent porosity to achieve aneurysm obliteration would allow clinicians to treat aneurysms more effectively. We sought to determine the optimal porosity threshold in an in vitro flow model that would lead to stagnation of flow in an aneurysm. METHODS Using a 3-dimensional (3-D) sidewall aneurysm glass model and a 2-dimensional (2-D) cavity model, we measured the total kinetic energy (TKE) in the cavity and aneurysm using digital particle image velocimetry by adjusting for the surface area of a metal mesh across the cavity. Additionally, we assessed how a gap between the mesh and 2-D cavity impacted circulatory patterns within a cavity. RESULTS In the 3-D aneurysm model, we noted a 90.4% reduction in TKE after placement of a stent. In the 2-D cavity model, we adjusted the porosity between 39.1% and 64.8% and noted a reduction in the TKE by 99.75% and 93.9%, respectively. When there was a gap between the mesh and entry into the cavity, unfavorable circulatory conditions occurred with the development of counterclockwise flow that had increased TKE within the cavity. CONCLUSIONS The current model demonstrates a method to evaluate the optimal porosity threshold to achieve thrombosis of an aneurysm as a primary modality. Moreover, a gap may occur between the stent and the aneurysm that may create unfavorable circulatory conditions by increasing flow into the aneurysm.","Rayepalli, Sagar; Gupta, Rishi; Lum, Chee; Majid, Arshad; Koochesfahani, Manoochehr",Journal of neuroimaging : official journal of the American Society of Neuroimaging,277,1

We retrospectively reviewed the charts of eligible patients who underwent multimodal IAT including intra-arterial thrombolysis, mechanical thrombectomy, balloon and/or stent angioplasty (IAT group) or IVT alone (IVT group). Outcomes included the revascularization rate 24 hours postprocedure, the frequency of survival at 7, 90, and 180 days postonset, and a measure of functional outcomes using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). The IAT group included 62 patients and the IVT group included 31 patients. Multimodal IAT increased the revascularization rate at 24 hours (p<0.001) and the frequency of survival and functional independence (mRS ≤2) at 7 days (p<0.001 and p=0.018, respectively), 90 days (both p<0.001), and 180 days (both p<0.001). Independent predictors of longer survival were treatment with multimodal IAT (HR 0.1; 95% CI 0.0 to 0.4; p<0.001) and revascularization (HR 0.1; 95% CI 0.0 to 0.4; p<0.001), whereas a longer duration from onset to treatment was a risk factor for death (HR 1.4; 95% CI 1.2 to 1.8; p<0.001). There was no significant between-group difference for symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation. This study found that for patients with severe hypertensive ACI with large vessel occlusions, multimodal IAT improved the outcomes, including early revascularization, survival, and functional outcome.","Tian, Zuojun; Liao, Geng; Li, Shaoming; Shen, Yuechun; Chen, Changbing; Liu, Lei; Li, Yiheng",Journal of investigative medicine : the official publication of the American Federation for Clinical Research,277,16

This article discusses relevant mechanistic underpinnings of this novel paradigm. It also addresses how such knowledge may be leveraged to develop novel electroceutical solutions to manage biofilms in the context of surgical infection. Recent Advances: Systematic review and meta-analysis of several hundred wound studies reported a 78.2% prevalence of biofilms in chronic wounds. Biofilm infection is a major cause of delayed wound healing. In the host-microbe microenvironment, bioelectrical factors influence microbial, host as well as host-microbe interactions. CRITICAL ISSUES Rapid biological responses are driven by electrical signals generated by minute currents of ions moving across cell membranes. Bacterial life, growth and function relies on a bioelectrical milieu which when perturbed impairs their ability to form biofilm, a major threat to healthcare. Viral stability depends on electrostatic forces. Weak electrical field strength, otherwise safe for humans, can achieve such benefit. In the host, electric field enhanced keratinocyte migration, bolstered immune defenses, improved mitochondrial function and demonstrated multiple other effects consistent with supporting wound healing. Deeper mechanistic understanding of electrical principles will inform the design of next generation electroceuticals. FUTURE DIRECTIONS This is an opportune moment in time as there is a surge of interest in electroceuticals in medicine. Projected to reach $35.5 billion by 2025, electroceuticals are becoming a cynosure in the global market. WHO reports that more than 50% of surgical site infections can be antibiotic resistant.

DESIGN Retrospective cohort study of SNF patients using 100% Medicare inpatient claims and Minimum Data Set resident assessment data. Linear probability models were used to estimate the probability of successful discharge based on patient and staff beliefs about the patient's ability to improve in function and patients and staff beliefs together. Estimates were adjusted for demographic, health status, functional characteristics, and SNF fixed effects. PARTICIPANTS Fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries aged ≥66 years who were discharged to a SNF following hospitalization for stroke, hip fracture or TBI. INTERVENTIONS Not Applicable MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Successful community discharge (discharged alive within 90 days of SNF admission and remaining in the community for ≥ 30 days without dying or health care facility readmission). RESULTS Patients with positive beliefs about their capability to increase independence with ADLs had a higher adjusted probability of successful discharge than patients with negative beliefs (positive: 63.8%, negative: 57.8%, difference: 6.0%, 95%CI=5.4, 6.6%). This remained true regardless of staff beliefs, but the difference in successful discharge probability between patients with positive and negative beliefs was larger when staff had positive beliefs. Conversely, the association between staff beliefs and successful discharge varied based on patient beliefs: if patients had positive beliefs, the difference in the probability of successful discharge between positive and negative staff beliefs was 2.5% (95%CI=1.0, 4.0). If patients had negative beliefs, the difference between positive and negative staff beliefs was -4.6% (95%CI=-6.0, -3.2). CONCLUSIONS Patients' beliefs have a significant association with the probability of successful discharge.

Median Cmax in the rifampin and rifabutin arms were 2.14 and 3.35 mg/liter, while median AUC0-24h were 30.1 and 59.5 mg·h/liter, respectively. Though pretomanid exposure in APT was significantly reduced with rifampin, AUC0-24 values were similar to those associated with effective treatment in registrational trials, likely because APT participants were fed with dosing, enhancing pretomanid relative bioavailability and exposures. Pretomanid concentrations with rifabutin were high, but in range with prior observations. While pretomanid exposures with rifampin are unlikely to impair efficacy, our data suggest that pretomanid should be taken with food if prescribed with rifampin.","Ignatius, Elisa H; Abdelwahab, Mahmoud Tareq; Hendricks, Bronwyn; Gupte, Nikhil; Narunsky, Kim; Wiesner, Lubbe; Barnes, Grace; Dawson, Rodney; Dooley, Kelly E; Denti, Paolo",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,277,19

Identifying such mechanisms is therefore a critical step for efforts aiming to reduce the high individual and societal burdens associated with substance use globally. OBJECTIVE This study aims to systematically identify and synthesize evidence on the modifiable mediators and moderators of the relationship between adverse childhood experiences and substance use outcomes in young people (age 10-24 years). METHODS A systematic review will be conducted using PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and CINAHL databases to determine the modifiable mediators and moderators of the relationship between adverse childhood experiences and substance use in young people. Data from the review will be qualitatively synthesized, unless we identify a sufficient number of studies (at least five) that examine the same type of adversity (eg, physical or sexual abuse) and the same mediator/moderator, in which case a quantitative synthesis (meta-analysis) will be conducted. If a quantitative synthesis is warranted, standardized effect estimates of the indirect (mediated) effect between adverse childhood experiences and substance use outcomes will be combined using a random-effects meta-analysis. Mediators/moderators will be grouped according to a socioecological perspective, using the four levels of individual, interpersonal, community, and public policy/culture. RESULTS Electronic searches were completed in August 2019. A total of 4004 studies were included for screening after removing duplicates. After evaluating titles and abstracts against eligibility criteria, a further 3590 studies were excluded, leaving 415 studies for full-text screening. The results of the review are expected to be available by December 2020. CONCLUSIONS The mechanisms linking adverse childhood experiences and substance use outcomes in young people are vital targets for substance use prevention efforts. This review will provide evidence to inform the development of prevention strategies in order to interrupt the negative life trajectory that can begin with childhood adversity.

In tracing these effects through recent changes in amputation protocols and less spectacular conditions such as posttraumatic stress disorder, I show that the prevalent model of ""veteran therapeutics,"" which posits cure as the aim of post-war, has perverse and cruel effects. Drawing on disability theory, I explore alternative ways to read the frictions that soldiers and veterans experience, stretched between the medical model of veteran therapeutics and an emergent sense that cure may be an impossible goal. Alternatively, the article turns to moments when veterans learn to live with disability, rather than living in anticipation of its end. Though small, such moments contain possibilities for a less cruel mode of inhabiting disability, offering incipient signs of what we might call a crip art of failure.","Wool, Zoë H",Medical anthropology quarterly,277,12

METHODS Between March and July 2020, when C-AMs were not available because of the COVID-19 pandemic, 28 corneal ulcers underwent FD-AM overlay transplantation and were retrospectively compared with 22 corneal ulcers treated with C-AM during the same period in 2018. All patients had at least 3 months of follow-up, and those who underwent combined surgeries were excluded. Ulcers were assessed at baseline and then at 72 hours, 1 month, and 3 months. Population demographics, follow-up time, ulcer etiologies, epithelial defect size, ulcer depth, and complications were also recorded. RESULTS Baseline characteristics and clinical features of both groups were comparable. There was no statistically significant difference in the number of overlay AM transplantations (P = 0.52) or early detachments (P = 0.57). At 3 months, the corneal healing rate was almost the same in both groups (89% and 91% for FD-AM and C-AM, respectively; P = 0.87). Complications were equally uncommon (11% and 9%, respectively; P = 0.92). In logistic regression, the type of the membrane did not influence corneal healing at 1 month (P = 0.42) or 3 months (P = 0.99), regardless of the depth of the ulcer. However, whatever the type of AM used, the deeper the ulcer was, the less likely it was to heal at 3 months (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS This is the first study that provides positive insight into the effectiveness of FD-AM compared with C-AM when used as overlay transplantation for treating corneal ulcers.","Memmi, Benjamin; Leveziel, Loïc; Knoeri, Juliette; Leclère, Amélie; Ribes, Olivier; Despiaux, Marie-Claire; Bouheraoua, Nacim; Nordmann, Jean-Philippe; Baudouin, Christophe; Borderie, Vincent",Cornea,277,9

In medical education, wellness has been proposed as a physician competency. In this article, the authors review the history of the ""wellness as a competency"" concept within U.S. and Canadian residency programs and medical schools. Drawing from literature on the discourses of wellness and competence in medical education, they argue that operationalizing wellness as a physician competency holds profound implications for curricula, admissions, evaluation, and licensure. While many definitions of ""wellness"" and ""competency"" are used within medical training environments, the authors argue that the definitions institutions ultimately use will have significant impacts for trainees who are considered ""unwell."" In particular, medical learners with disabilities--including those with mental health, chronic health, learning, sensory, and mobility disabilities--may not conform to dominant conceptions of ""wellness,"" and there is a risk they will become further stigmatized or even be considered unsuitable to practice in the profession. The authors conclude that framing wellness as a competency has the potential to legitimize support-seeking and prioritize physician health, yet it may also have the potential unintended effect of excluding certain learners from the profession. They propose a universal design approach to understand wellness at a systems level and to remove barriers to wellness for all medical learners.","Stergiopoulos, Erene; Hodges, Brian; Martimianakis, Maria Athina Tina",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,277,31

METHODS A retrospective study was conducted. The clinical data of 72 patients with COVID-19 admitted to intensive unit of Tongji Guanggu Hospital Affiliated to Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, Hubei Province from February 10th to 29th in 2020 were collected, including their general information, routine blood test, coagulation function, inflammatory parameters, cytokines, and organ function related laboratory parameters at admission. The patients were divided into two groups, namely D-dimer normal group (< 0.5 mg/L) and D-dimer elevated group (≥ 0.5 mg/L). The differences of general data, inflammatory parameters and cytokines between the two groups were compared. Besides, the correlation between D-dimer and organ function was analyzed by linear regression. The change in sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) between the first visit after the onset of the disease and admission to intensive unit ≥ 2 was defined as being combined with organ damage. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was drawn to evaluate the predictive value of D-dimer on organ damage in patients with COVID-19. RESULTS 65.3% of the 72 patients had abnormal coagulation. The D-dimer level of COVID-19 patients gradually increased with the aggravation of the disease, and the levels of ordinary type (n = 14), severe type (n = 49), and critical type (n = 9) were 0.43 (0.22, 0.89), 0.66 (0.26, 1.36), and 2.65 (0.68, 15.45) mg/L, respectively, with statistically significant difference (P < 0.05). Thirty-two patients (44.4%) had normal D-dimer, and 40 (55.6%) had elevated D-dimer. Compared with the normal D-dimer group, the patients in the D-dimer elevated group were older (years old: 67.7±11.6 vs. 54.0±13.1), and the levels of white blood cell count (WBC), neutrophil count (NEU), procalcitonin (PCT), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukins (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10), IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) at admission were significantly higher [WBC (×109/L): 7.16 (5.55, 9.75) vs. 5.25 (4.59, 6.98), NEU (×109/L): 7.11±5.46 vs. 3.33±1.58, PCT (μg/L): 0.08 (0.06, 0.21) vs. 0.05 (0.04, 0.06), hs-CRP (mg/L): 27.9 (3.4, 58.8) vs. 1.3 (0.8, 6.6), IL-6 (ng/L): 11.80 (2.97, 30.61) vs. 1.98 (1.50, 4.73), IL-8 (ng/L): 19.90 (13.33, 42.28) vs. 9.40 (12.35, 15.30), IL-10 (ng/L): 5.00 (5.00, 8.38) vs. 5.00 (5.00, 5.00), IL-2R (kU/L): 907.90±458.42 vs. 572.13±274.55, TNF-α (ng/L): 10.94±5.95 vs. 7.77±3.67], while lymphocyte (LYM) and monocyte (MON) counts were lower [LYM (×109/L): 1.14±0.49 vs. 1.46±0.42, MON (×109/L): 0.63±0.25 vs. 0.87±0.21], with significant differences (all P < 0.05). Linear regression analysis showed that D-dimer level was negatively related with pulse oxygen saturation (SpO2), oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2) and platelet count (PLT) with β values of -0.493, -11.615, and -0.018, respectively (all P < 0.05). However, D-dimer level was positively related with respiratory rate (RR), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin (TBil) and direct bilirubin (DBil) with β values of 0.485, 0.107, 0.291, and 0.404 (all P < 0.05). ROC curve analysis showed that the area under ROC curve (AUC) of D-dimer for predicting organ injury in COVID-19 patients was 0.889, and the 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 0.753-1.000. When the optimal cut-off value was 2.36 mg/L, the sensitivity was 85.7%, and the specificity was 78.1%. CONCLUSIONS D-dimer levels in COVID-19 patients are correlated with inflammatory factors and organ function, and it can be used to predict organ injury.","Xu, Ying; Qian, Yajun; Gu, Qin; Tang, Jian",Zhonghua wei zhong bing ji jiu yi xue,277,1

We investigated these differences to inform prevention and control programmes. METHODS We extracted TB notifications from the Portuguese National TB Surveillance System (SVIG-TB) in 2010-2017, disaggregated by region, age group, country of birth and HIV status. We calculated notification rates using denominators from the Portuguese National Institute of Statistics and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS and performed stratified time series analysis. We estimated interannual decline percentages and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using Poisson and binomial negative regression models. RESULTS The overall TB notification rate decreased from 25.7 to 17.5/100,000 population from 2010 to 2017 (5.2%/year) in Portugal. Interannual decline did not differ significantly between regions, but it was smaller amongst non-Portuguese nationals (-1.57% [CI: -4.79%, 1.75%] vs -5.85% [CI: -6.98%, -4.70%] in Portuguese nationals); children under five years of age (+1.77% [CI: -4.61%, 8.58%] vs -5.38% [CI: -6.33%, -4.42%] in other age groups); and HIV-negative people (-6.47% [CI: -9.10%, -3.77%] vs -11.29% [CI; -17.51%, -4.60%] in HIV-positive). CONCLUSIONS The decline in TB notification rates in Portugal during the study period has been steady. However, the decline amongst non-Portuguese nationals, children under five years of age and non-infected-HIV patients was lower. No significant differences were observed between regions. Changes in TB epidemiology in specific risk groups and geographical areas should be closely monitored to achieve the objectives of the End TB Strategy. We recommend intensifying screening of TB in the subpopulations identified.","Sentís, A; Prats-Uribe, A; Peixoto, V R; Caylà, J A; Gomes, M D; Sousa, S; Duarte, R; Carvalho, I; Carvalho, C",Pulmonology,277,17

BACKGROUND AA patients are at higher risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes after PCI and may derive greater benefit from the use of potent antiplatelet therapy. METHODS Using the multicenter PROMETHEUS observational registry of ACS patients treated with PCI, we grouped patients by self-reported AA or other races. Clinical outcomes at 90-day and 1-year included non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), major adverse cardiac events (composite of death, MI, stroke, or unplanned revascularization) and major bleeding. RESULTS The study population included 2,125 (11%) AA and 17,707 (89%) non-AA patients. AA patients were younger, more often female (46% vs. 30%) with a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and prior coronary intervention than non-AA patients. Although AA patients more often presented with troponin (+) ACS, prasugrel use was much less common in AA vs. non-AA (11.9% vs. 21.4%, respectively, P = 0.001). In addition, the use of prasugrel increased with the severity of presentation in non-AA but not in AA patients. Multivariable logistic regression showed AA race was an independent predictor of reduced use of prasugrel (0.42 [0.37-0.49], P < 0.0001). AA race was independently associated with a significantly higher risk of MI at 90-days and 1 year after PCI. CONCLUSIONS Despite higher risk clinical presentation and worse 1-year ischemic outcomes, AA race was an independent predictor of lower prasugrel prescription in a contemporary population of ACS patients undergoing PCI.","Faggioni, Michela; Baber, Usman; Chandrasekhar, Jaya; Sartori, Samantha; Weintraub, William; Rao, Sunil V; Vogel, Birgit; Claessen, Bimmer; Kini, Annapoorna; Effron, Mark; Ge, Zhen; Keller, Stuart; Strauss, Craig; Snyder, Clayton; Toma, Catalin; Weiss, Sandra; Aquino, Melissa; Baker, Brian; Defranco, Anthony; Bansilal, Sameer; Muhlestein, Brent; Kapadia, Samir; Pocock, Stuart; Poddar, Kanhaiya L; Henry, Timothy D; Mehran, Roxana",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,277,5

This is in addition to its anti-mutagenic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, hypoglycemic, anti-estrogenic, and anti-platelet aggregating activities. In this study, an approximate 6-fold increase in the production of PHBA was achieved via biotransformation of caffeic acid by C. albicans. The improvement was performed in two steps: first, through mutation by gamma irradiation (5 KGy dose), resulting in the recovery of a mutant (CI-24), which produced approximately triple the amount of PHBA produced by the wild-type isolate. Then, biotransformation by this mutant was further optimized via response surface methodology model-based optimization. The maximum PHBA production (7.47 mg/ml) was obtained in a fermentation medium composed of 1% w/v yeast extract as a nitrogen source, with an initial pH of 6.6, incubated at 28°C at an agitation rate of 250 rpm. To further enhance the performance and economics of the process, cells of the CI-24 mutant were immobilized in calcium alginate beads and could retain an equivalent biotransformation capacity after three successive biotransformation cycles.

OBJECTIVE We explored the clinical management of inpatients with COVID-19 in Italy. METHODS A self-administered survey was sent by email to Italian physicians caring for adult patients with COVID-19. A panel of experts was selected according to their clinical curricula and their responses were analyzed. RESULTS A total of 1,215 physicians completed the survey questionnaire (17.4% response rate). Of these, 188 (15.5%) were COVID-19 experts. Chest computed tomography was the most used method to detect and monitor COVID-19 pneumonia. Most of the experts managed acute respiratory failure with CPAP (56.4%), high flow nasal cannula (18.6%), and non-invasive mechanical ventilation (8%), while an intensivist referral for early intubation was requested in 17% of the cases. Hydroxychloroquine was prescribed as an antiviral in 90% of cases, both as monotherapy (11.7%), and combined with protease inhibitors (43.6%) or azithromycin (36.2%). The experts unanimously prescribed low-molecular-weight heparin to patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, and half of them (51.6%) used a dose higher than standard. The respiratory burden in patients who survived the acute phase was estimated as relevant in 28.2% of the cases, modest in 39.4%, and negligible in 9%. CONCLUSIONS In our survey some major topics, such as the role of non-invasive respiratory support and drug treatments, show disagreement between experts, likely reflecting the absence of high-quality evidence studies.

Unexpectedly, we have uncovered a previously undescribed pathway promoting mucous metaplasia that involves VEGFa and its receptor KDR. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis coupled with genetic mouse modeling demonstrates that loss of epithelial VEGFa, KDR, or MEK/ERK kinase promotes excessive club-to-goblet transdifferentiation during development and regeneration. Sox9 is required for goblet cell differentiation following Kdr inhibition in both mouse and human club cells. Significantly, airway mucous metaplasia in asthmatic and CF patients is also associated with reduced KDR signaling and increased SOX9 expression.

This is the first study to focus on highly time-resolved chemical speciation and source apportionment of PM2.5 to assess the impact of the lockdown and subsequent relaxations on the sources of ambient PM2.5 in Delhi, India. The elemental, organic, and black carbon fractions of PM2.5 were measured at the IIT Delhi campus from February 2020 to May 2020. We report source apportionment results using positive matrix factorization (PMF) of organic and elemental fractions of PM2.5 during the different phases of the lockdown. The resolved sources such as vehicular emissions, domestic coal combustion, and semi-volatile oxygenated organic aerosol (SVOOA) were found to decrease by 96%, 95%, and 86%, respectively, during lockdown phase-1 as compared to pre-lockdown. An unforeseen rise in O3 concentrations with declining NOx levels was observed, similar to other parts of the globe, leading to the low-volatility oxygenated organic aerosols (LVOOA) increasing to almost double the pre-lockdown concentrations during the last phase of the lockdown. The effect of the lockdown was found to be less pronounced on other resolved sources like secondary chloride, power plants, dust-related, hydrocarbon-like organic aerosols (HOA), and biomass burning related emissions, which were also swayed by the changing meteorological conditions during the four lockdown phases. The results presented in this study provide a basis for future emission control strategies, quantifying the extent to which constraining certain anthropogenic activities can ameliorate the ambient air. These results have direct relevance to not only Delhi but the entire Indo-Gangetic plain (IGP), citing similar geographical and meteorological conditions common to the region along with overlapping regional emission sources. SUMMARY OF MAIN FINDINGS: We identify sources like vehicular emissions, domestic coal combustion, and semi-volatile oxygenated organic aerosol (SVOOA) to be severely impacted by the lockdown, whereas ozone levels and, in turn, low-volatility oxygenated organic aerosols (LVOOA) rise by more than 95% compared to the pre-lockdown concentrations during the last phase of the lockdown. However, other sources resolved in this study, like secondary chloride, power plants, dust-related, hydrocarbon-like organic aerosols (HOA), and biomass burning related emissions, were mainly driven by the changes in the meteorological conditions rather than the lockdown.","Manchanda, Chirag; Kumar, Mayank; Singh, Vikram; Faisal, Mohd; Hazarika, Naba; Shukla, Ashutosh; Lalchandani, Vipul; Goel, Vikas; Thamban, Navaneeth; Ganguly, Dilip; Tripathi, Sachchida Nand",Environment international,277,1

Maine, a high Lyme disease incidence state, has been experiencing warmer and shorter winter seasons, and relatively more so in its northern tier. Maine served as a case study to investigate the interacting impacts of deer and seasonal climatology on the spatial and temporal distribution of I. scapularis. A passive tick surveillance dataset indexed abundance of I. scapularis nymphs for the state, 1990-2013. With Maine's wildlife management districts as the spatial unit, we used a generalized additive model to assess linear and nonlinear relationships between I. scapularis nymph abundance and predictors. Nymph submission rate increased with increasing deer densities up to ~5 deer/km2 (13 deer/mi2), but beyond this threshold did not vary with deer density. This corroborated the idea of a saturating relationship between I. scapularis and deer density. Nymphs also were associated with warmer minimum winter temperatures, earlier degree-day accumulation, and higher relative humidity. However, nymph abundance only increased with warmer winters and degree-day accumulation where deer density exceeded ~2 deer/km2 (~6/mi2). Anticipated increases in I. scapularis in the northern tier could be partially mitigated through deer herd management.","Elias, Susan P; Gardner, Allison M; Maasch, Kirk A; Birkel, Sean D; Anderson, Norman T; Rand, Peter W; Lubelczyk, Charles B; Smith, Robert P",Journal of medical entomology,277,26

Many clinical trials over the last 20 years have used measurements of carotid artery stenosis as a means to risk stratify patients. However, with improvements in vascular imaging techniques such as CT angiography and MR angiography, ultrasonography, and PET/CT, it is now possible to risk stratify patients, not just on the degree of carotid artery stenosis but also on how vulnerable the plaque is to rupture, resulting in ischemic stroke. These imaging techniques are ushering in an emerging paradigm shift that allows for risk stratifications based on the presence of imaging features such as intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH), plaque ulceration, plaque neovascularity, fibrous cap thickness, and presence of a lipid-rich necrotic core (LRNC). It is important for the neurosurgeon to be aware of these new imaging techniques that allow for improved patient risk stratification and outcomes. For example, a patient with a low-grade stenosis but an ulcerated plaque may benefit more from a revascularization procedure than a patient with a stable 70% asymptomatic stenosis with a thick fibrous cap. This review summarizes the current state-of-the-art advances in carotid plaque imaging. Currently, MRI is the gold standard in carotid plaque imaging, with its high resolution and high sensitivity for identifying IPH, ulceration, LRNC, and inflammation. However, MRI is limited due to time constraints. CT also allows for high-resolution imaging and can accurately detect ulceration and calcification, but cannot reliably differentiate LRNC from IPH. PET/CT is an effective technique to identify active inflammation within the plaque, but it does not allow for assessment of anatomy, ulceration, IPH, or LRNC. Ultrasonography, with the aid of contrast enhancement, is a cost-effective technique to assess plaque morphology and characteristics, but it is limited in sensitivity and specificity for detecting LRNC, plaque hemorrhage, and ulceration compared with MRI. Also summarized is how these advanced imaging techniques are being used in clinical practice to risk stratify patients with low- and high-grade carotid artery stenosis. For example, identification of IPH on MRI in patients with low-grade carotid artery stenosis is a risk factor for failure of medical therapy, and studies have shown that such patients may fair better with carotid endarterectomy (CEA). MR plaque imaging has also been found to be useful in identifying revascularization candidates who would be better candidates for CEA than carotid artery stenting (CAS), as high intraplaque signal on time of flight imaging is associated with vulnerable plaque and increased rates of adverse events in patients undergoing CAS but not CEA.","Brinjikji, Waleed; Huston, John; Rabinstein, Alejandro A; Kim, Gyeong-Moon; Lerman, Amir; Lanzino, Giuseppe",Journal of neurosurgery,277,1

From this point of view, this review aims to summarize both the socio-economic and public health implications of these parallel outbreaks along with their best possible management approaches. Online databases (PubMed/PMC/Medline, Publons, ResearchGate, Scopus, Google Scholar, etc.) were used to collect the necessary information regarding these outbreaks. Based on the reports published and analyses performed so far, the long-lasting impacts caused by these simultaneous outbreaks on global socio-economical and public health status can be conceived from the past experiences of outbreaks, especially the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, prolonged restrictions by the local government may lead to food insecurity, global recession, and an enormous impact on the mental health of people of all ages, specifically in developing countries. Such overwhelming effects have already been reported to be declining the national growth of the economy as well as increasing political insecurity and shortage of basic needs. Although various actions have already been taken, including vaccination, clinical management and further research, social distancing, lockdown, etc., to improve the situation, the emerging variants and associated genetic mutations may make containment difficult, worsening the situation again. So, considering the current mutational dynamics of the pathogens and past experiences, perpetual preparedness along with updated clinical management backed by epidemiological studies and innovative scientific effort are inevitable to combat the simultaneous waves of multiple infectious diseases.","Khan, Afroza Ema Nayeema Talukder Rakhi Nadira Naznin Saha Otun Ahamed Tamer Rahaman Md.

MIS-C combines features of Kawasaki disease and Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS). MethodsChildren with suspected MIS-C were included within the first week of diagnosis and a large scale immunoassay was performed to determein the immunologic signature of these patients. ResultsWe characterized the immunological profile of 27 MIS-C cases in comparison with 4 KD and 4 TSS cases. Similarly to TSS, an increase of serum inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-a, CD25s) was observed in MIS-C contrasting with low expression of HLA-DR monocytes, a feature often associated with immune paralysis. Expansions of T cells expressing the V{beta}21.3 T cell receptor {beta} chain variable region were detected in both CD4 and CD8 subsets in almost 50% of patients and V{beta}21.3-positive T cells expressed high level of HLA-DR highlighting their specific activation. TCR sequencing uncovered the polyclonal nature of the V{beta} 21.3+ population. SARS-CoV2 antigene-specific production of interferon gamma in T cells was not increased in MIS-C T cells compared to COVID-19 patients suggesting the antigen-specific immune response in MIS-C patients is not pivotal to the manifestation. ConclusionsOur findings argue in favor of a strong activation of the immune system related to a superantigenic immune response in MIS-C with a specific polyclonal V{beta}21.3 T cell expansion. Key messagesWhat is already known about this subject ? MIS-C occurs 3-5 weeks after acute SARS-CoV2 infection and overlap features of Toxic Shock syndrome and Kawasaki disease. MIS-C appears different in term of cytokine and autoantibodies generation from KD with subtle signs of T cells activation What does this study add? This study demonstrates that V{beta}21.3+ CD4 and CD8 T cells are highly increased in about 50% of MIS-C and distinctive of the V{beta}2+ expansion observed in toxic shock syndrome in This reflects a specific T cell activation and cytokine release syndrome similar to toxic shock syndrome How mich this impact on clinical practice or future developments? V{beta}21.3+ signature can be available on a short term basis by flowcytometry and represents a signature of the MIS-C. As for TSS, immunomodulating therapies may revert the superantigenic activation and resolve this life threatening pediatric condition.","Moreews, M.; Le Gouge, K.; Bellomo, A.; Malcus, C.; Pescarmona, R.; Khaldi-Plassart, S.; Djebali, S.; Mathieu, A.-L.; Perret, M.; Villard, M.; Chopin, E.; Rouvet, I.; Vandenesh, F.; Dupieux, C.; Pouyau, R.; Teyssedre, S.; Guerder, M.; Louazon, T.; Anne-Moulin-Zinsch,; Duperril, M.; Patural, H.; Giovannini-Chami, L.; Portefaix, A.; Kassai, B.; Venet, F.; Monneret, G.; Lombard, C.; Flodrops, H.; Bastard, P.; Zhang, S.-Y.; Dubois, V.; Thaunat, O.; Richard, J.-C.; Mezidi, M.; Abel, L.; Casanova, J.

In this context, the need to conciliate the safety of the visitors and the protection of artworks represents a challenging task. The possibility that accumulation of vapour coming from the sanitizing solutions or from accidental spills, potentially caused also by visitors, should be considered. The study focuses specifically on the possible interactions between sanitizing alcohol-based products and silk, since this material is present in many cultural sites all over the world on upholsteries and tapestries.

Chemical and morphological variations on the silk have been evaluated with Scanning Electron Microscopy - SEM, Atomic Force Microscopy - AFM and portable instruments (contact microscope, colorimeter, Infrared and Raman spectroscopy). IR and Raman analyses did not detect significant chemical changes in silk. However, Raman spectra showed, after immersion treatments, minor variations in the intensity of peaks attributed to dyes.

In recent years, risk scholars have increasingly focused their energies on climate change, and as pandemic coronavirus has swept the globe many of these scholars are comparing the coronavirus pandemic with climate change to inform risk management. Risk communication research and the best practices developed from it are predicated on findings from the 1970’s to the present showing that there are structural similarities in how people think about widely divergent risks. Consequently, these lessons from risk communication of climate change (and from the canon of best practices) apply to the coronavirus pandemic. In the empirical comparison of student perceptions reported here, we replicate these structural similarity findings, but also find that moral concerns in particular deserve attention as a potentially distinct dimension of risk perception, on which different risks may also differ, as pandemic risks appear to evoke less moral concern than climate change. The need for communications to be timely, honest, credible, empathetic, and informative for useful individual actions is fundamental and essential for communicating effectively about the coronavirus epidemic. Some countries have heeded risk sciences, and are coping more successfully with pandemic coronavirus. Others have failed to implement these old lessons, which our data suggest still apply. While these failures may reinforce cynicism about political and public enthusiasm for accepting science, comparisons between the coronavirus pandemic and climate change may also foster greater aspirations for collective action.","Bostrom, Ann; Böhm, Gisela; O’Connor, Robert E.; Hanss, Daniel; Bodi-Fernandez, Otto; Halder, Pradipta",J.

This study begins by describing how screening for disease has historically been performed. It proposes four measurement characteristics of an ideal screening solution: non-contact, effective, rapid and low-cost measurements. Next, it reviews the existing literature on fever-screening using non-contact infrared thermometer (NCIT) devices as well as infrared thermography (IRT) devices, as these are two technologies which have experienced increasing use. For this review, 185 research papers were identified, 21 research studies were included after inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied. A total of 35 experiments were identified for analysis and their results tabulated. Of these studies, 66% are IRT and 34% are NCIT, with a median sample size of 430 subjects. 26 experiments involve febrile participants, with a median febrile percentage of 11.22 % of population. The reported sensitivity of febrile detection using NCIT varies from 3.7% to 97% and when using IRT it varies from 15% to 100%. Both indoor and outdoor studies are investigated, as well as those conducted in acute and non-acute settings. The results of this review show a clear lack of consensus on the effectiveness of these systems. Overall, these results indicate that sensitivity and specificity are reduced when using IRT and NCIT technologies compared to other thermometers used in medical practice. Their use should be carefully assessed based on the risks present in each particular measurement scenario. CCBY","Adams, S. D.; Valentine, A.; Bucknall, T.; Kouzani, A. Z.",IEEE Sensors Journal,277,1

Data were collected via a questionnaire survey. The survey was administered between January and April 2021 and the total number of properly completed questionnaires was 786. The findings show that, first, almost all of the Social Resilience Indicators (SRIs) have experienced negative and unfavorable changes during the pandemic in Tehran. This is remarkably the case for social coping style, social capital, social relationship, and social adaptability. Second, no significant difference in the state of SRIs was observed among different SDGs, except for the age group of 17–20, educational groups with diploma and post-diploma education, and the educational occupational group. Third, testing the impact of the state of SRIs on SDGs indicated a positive and statistically significant impact in four paths, namely SRIs with gender, SRIs with age, SRIs with Job, and SRIs with education. Our results can shed more light on SRIs that can be used to measure the state of social resilience in communities affected by the pandemic, like Tehran. They can also provide insights into actions that should be taken by planners and policy makers to enhance resilience in other communities with similar conditions.","Alizadeh, Hadi Sharifi Ayyoob",International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction,277,15

This is an unprecedented event, which is influencing the health care, political, economic, and social welfare systems. Among Western countries, Italy has been one of the first severely hit by the pandemic in terms of number of cases and mortality rates. On March 8, 2020, the Italian Prime Minister issued restrictive measures in order to limit the spread of the disease. During this period known as “Phase one” of the national health emergency, all not necessary activities have been closed, more than 29,000 people have died and almost 100,000 people have been home-isolated, with strict lockdown measures. The COvid Mental hEalth Trial (COMET) network, including ten university Italian sites and the National Institute of Health, has promoted a national online survey in order to evaluate the impact of lockdown measures on the mental health of the Italian general population. The COMET survey reports data from a large sample of more than 20.000 people from Italian general population, showing that lockdown has had a detrimental impact on mental health, in terms of worsening of anxiety, depressive and stress symptoms.

We described time trends in social contacts for the pre-pandemic and pandemic periods in Quebec, Canada. Methods: CONNECT is a population-based study of social contacts conducted shortly before (2018/2019) and during the Covid-19 pandemic (April 2020 to February 2021), using the same methodology for both periods. We recruited participants by random-digit-dialing and collected data by self-administered web-based questionnaires. Questionnaires documented socio-demographic characteristics and social contacts for two assigned days. A contact was defined as a two-way conversation at a distance [≤]2 meters or as a physical contact, irrespective of masking. We used weighted generalized linear models with a Poisson distribution and robust variance (taking possible overdispersion into account) to compare the mean number of social contacts over time by characteristics. Results: A total of 1291 and 5516 Quebecers completed the study before and during the pandemic, respectively. Contacts significantly decreased from a mean of 8 contacts/day prior to the pandemic to 3 contacts/day during the spring 2020 lockdown. Contacts remained lower than the pre-Covid period thereafter (lowest=3 contacts/day during the Christmas 2020/2021 holidays, highest=5 in September 2020). Contacts at work, during leisure activities/other locations, and at home with visitors showed the greatest decreases since the beginning of the pandemic. All sociodemographic subgroups showed significant decreases of contacts since the beginning of the pandemic. Conclusion: Physical distancing measures in Quebec significantly decreased social contacts, which most likely mitigated the spread of Covid-19.","Drolet, M.; Godbout, A.; Mondor, M.; Drolet-Roy, L.; Beraud, G.; Lemmieux-Mellouki, P.; Demers, E.; Boily, M.-C.; Sauvageau, C.; De Serres, G.; Hens, N.; Beutels, P.; Dervaux, B.; Brisson, M.",,277,1

We seek to analyze the criteria, conditions and principles of their transfer and the international legal framework and interstate practice. We seek to investigate the international legal regulation of the development and transfer of marine technologies in legal research. The authors consider the importance of facilitating the transfer of marine technology in relation to promoting marine scientific research which is reaffirmed by international agreements, including the Rio+20 outcome document: The future we want, and the outcome document of the third International Conference on Small Island Developing States as well as discussions on the Sustainable Development Goals, numerous UN General Assembly resolutions. Methodology: The research uses general scientific and special cognitive techniques wherein legal analysis and synthesis, systemic, formal-legal, comparative-legal, historical-legal and dialectical methods are applied. Results: We found out that despite the fact that the UNESCO IOC Guidelines have clarified a number of provisions of the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea concerning the development and transfer of marine technologies, this document needs revision. In particular, it is necessary to specify the criteria and terms for the transfer of marine technologies to both developed and developing states. It is not clear from the text of the document which technologies should be transferred free of charge or at a reduced cost to developing states and states with an unfavorable geographical position. We also point out the as part of the implementation of SDG 14, the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission is charged with elaborating research capacity in marine scientific research and optimizing the transfer of marine technology to developing and least developed states. The research indicates that the modern international legal framework needs a revision. Contributions: Following a review of the content, we raised possible problems, strategies, suggestions and guidelines for the marine technologies.The authors come to the conclusion that promoting the development and transfer of marine technologies to developing states and states with an unfavorable geographical position is not only consonant with the SDGs, but is also one of the mechanisms for their implementation.

However, uncertainty obtained by approximate inference techniques, such as variational inference, cannot guarantee optimal predictions to represent the model error and is prone to miscalibration (and often poor calibration) due to the assumption of the constant cost of misclassification, which is not realistic in medical diagnosis. Knowing how much confidence there is in a prediction is essential for gaining clinicians' trust in the technology. Bayesian decision theory provides a principled approach for optimal decision making under uncertainty, given a utility function over actions. We propose a variational inference with Monte Carlo Drop-weights based Bayesian neural networks model, which means cost-sensitive calibrated predictive uncertainty can be estimated while minimising asymmetric cost as an expected utility function with improved accuracy. We measured bias-corrected uncertainty using Jackknife resampling technique and propose uncertainty estimation performance metrics, including risk coverage curve, which directly corresponds to well-calibrated estimated uncertainty performance. We have highlighted potential issues in commonly used performance metrics, calibration measures, the quality of the estimated uncertainty and proposed revised metrics to mitigate them.

Phylogenetic analysis was performed to further characterize the viruses and to evaluate species association and geographic patterns. Astroviruses were identified in samples from 86% of the chicken flocks and from 100% of the turkey flocks. Both chicken astrovirus and avian nephritis virus (ANV) were identified in chicken samples, and often both viruses were detected in the same flock.

Rotaviruses were present in 46.5% of the chicken flocks tested and in 69.7% of the turkey flocks tested. Based upon the rotavirus NSP4 gene sequence, the chicken and turkey origin rotaviruses assorted in a species-specific manner. The turkey origin rotaviruses also assorted based upon geographical location. Reoviruses were identified in 62.8% and 45.5% of chicken and turkey flocks, respectively.

INTERVENTION An encapsulated mixture of unrefined Echinacea purpurea herb (25%) and root (25%) and E. angustifolia root (50%) taken in 1-g doses six times on the first day of illness and three times on each subsequent day of illness for a maximum of 10 days. MEASUREMENTS Severity and duration of self-reported symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection. RESULTS No statistically significant differences were detected between the echinacea and placebo groups for any of the measured outcomes. Trajectories of severity over time were nearly identical in the two groups. Mean cold duration was 6.01 days in both groups as a whole, 5.75 days in the placebo group, and 6.27 days in the echinacea group (between-group difference, -0.52 day [95% CI, -1.09 to 0.22 days]).

To help address this gap, we convened a Summit of academic and practice experts to develop a set of principles for legally and ethically sound public health resource triage decision-making in emergencies. METHODS The invitation-only Summit, held in Washington, D.C., on June 29, 2006, assembled 20 experts from a combination of academic institutions and nonacademic leadership, policy, and practice settings. The Summit featured a tabletop exercise designed to highlight resource scarcity challenges in a public health infectious disease emergency. This exercise served as a springboard for Summit participants' subsequent identification of 10 public health emergency resource allocation principles through an iterative process. RESULTS The final product of the Summit was a set of 10 principles to guide allocation decisions involving scarce resources in public health emergencies. The principles are grouped into three categories: obligations to community; balancing personal autonomy and community well-being/benefit; and good preparedness practice. CONCLUSIONS The 10 Summit-derived principles represent an attempt to link law, ethics, and real-world public health emergency resource allocation practices, and can serve as a useful starting framework to guide further systematic approaches and future research on addressing public health resource scarcity in an all-hazards context.","Barnett, Daniel J; Taylor, Holly A; Hodge, James G; Links, Jonathan M",Public health reports,277,5

Prescribing optimal nutrient doses is challenging because of the involvement of many variables including weather, soils, land management, genotypes, and severity of pests and diseases. Where sufficient data are available, machine learning algorithms can be used to predict crop performance. The objective of this study was to determine an optimal model predicting nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium requirements for high tuber yield and quality (size and specific gravity) as impacted by weather, soils and land management variables. We exploited a data set of 273 field experiments conducted from 1979 to 2017 in Quebec (Canada). We developed, evaluated and compared predictions from a hierarchical Mitscherlich model, k-nearest neighbors, random forest, neural networks and Gaussian processes. Machine learning models returned R2 values of 0.49-0.59 for tuber marketable yield prediction, which were higher than the Mitscherlich model R2 (0.37). The models were more likely to predict medium-size tubers (R2 = 0.60-0.69) and tuber specific gravity (R2 = 0.58-0.67) than large-size tubers (R2 = 0.55-0.64) and marketable yield. Response surfaces from the Mitscherlich model, neural networks and Gaussian processes returned smooth responses that agreed more with actual evidence than discontinuous curves derived from k-nearest neighbors and random forest models. When conditioned to obtain optimal dosages from dose-response surfaces given constant weather, soil and land management conditions, some disagreements occurred between models. Due to their built-in ability to develop recommendations within a probabilistic risk-assessment framework, Gaussian processes stood out as the most promising algorithm to support decisions that minimize economic or agronomic risks.","Coulibali, Zonlehoua; Cambouris, Athyna Nancy; Parent, Serge-Étienne",PLoS One,277,16

However, naked mRNA is rapidly degraded by the body and cannot effectively penetrate cells. Vectors capable of addressing these issues while allowing endosomal escape are therefore needed. To date, the most widely used vectors for this purpose have been lipid-based vectors. Thus, we have designed an innovative vector called LipoParticles (LP) consisting of poly(lactic) acid (PLA) nanoparticles coated with a 15/85 mol/mol DSPC/DOTAP lipid membrane. An in vitro investigation was carried out to examine whether the incorporation of a solid core offered added value compared to liposomes alone. To that end, a formulation strategy that we have named particulate layer-by-layer (pLbL) was used. This method permitted the adsorption of nucleic acids on the surface of LP (mainly by means of electrostatic interactions through the addition of LAH4-L1 peptide), allowing both cellular penetration and endosomal escape. After a thorough characterization of size, size distribution, and surface charge- and a complexation assessment of each vector-their transfection capacity and cytotoxicity (on antigenic presenting cells, namely DC2.4, and epithelial HeLa cells) were compared. LP have been shown to be significantly better transfecting agents than liposomes through pLbL formulation on both HeLa and DC 2.4 cells. These data illustrate the added value of a solid particulate core inside a lipid membrane, which is expected to rigidify the final assemblies and makes them less prone to early loss of mRNA. In addition, this assembly promoted not only efficient delivery of mRNA, but also of plasmid DNA, making it a versatile nucleic acid carrier that could be used for various vaccine applications. Finally, if the addition of the LAH4-L1 peptide systematically leads to toxicity of the pLbL formulation on DC 2.4 cells, the optimization of the nucleic acid/LAH4-L1 peptide mass ratio becomes an interesting strategy-essentially reducing the peptide intake to limit its cytotoxicity while maintaining a relevant transfection efficiency.","Ayad, Camille; Libeau, Pierre; Lacroix-Gimon, Céline; Ladavière, Catherine; Verrier, Bernard",,277,16

METHODS: We retrospectively collected data on non-operating room (OR) intubations from February 1-April 23, 2020. All patients undergoing emergency intubation outside the OR were eligible for inclusion. Data were entered using an airway procedure note integrated within the electronic health record. Variables included level of training and specialty of the laryngoscopist, the patient's indication for intubation, methods of intubation, induction and paralytic agents, grade of view, use of video laryngoscopy, number of attempts, and adverse events. We performed a descriptive analysis comparing intubations with an available positive COVID-19 test result with cases that had either a negative or unavailable test result. RESULTS: We obtained 406 independent procedure notes filed between February 1-April 23, 2020, and of these, 123 cases had a positive COVID-19 test result. Residents performed fewer tracheal intubations in COVID-19 cases when compared to nurse anesthetists (26.0% vs 37.4%). Video laryngoscopy was used significantly more in COVID-19 cases (91.1% vs 56.8%). No difference in first-pass success was observed between COVID-19 positive cases and controls (89.4% vs. 89.0%, p = 1.0). An increased rate of oxygen desaturation was observed in COVID-19 cases (20.3% vs. 9.9%) while there was no difference in the rate of other recorded complications and first-pass success. DISCUSSION: An average twofold increase in the rate of tracheal intubation was observed after March 24, 2020, corresponding with an influx of COVID-19 positive cases. We observed adherence to society guidelines regarding performance of tracheal intubation by an expert laryngoscopist and the use of video laryngoscopy.","Hawkins, Andrew; Stapleton, Stephanie; Rodriguez, Gerardo; Gonzalez, R Mauricio; Baker, William E",West J Emerg Med,277,1

However, the subjective assessment of radiographic examination is a time-consuming task and demands expert radiologists. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have enhanced the diagnostic power of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tools and assisted medical specialists in making efficient diagnostic decisions. In this work, we propose an optimal multilevel deep-aggregated boosted network to recognize COVID-19 infection from heterogeneous radiographic data, including X-ray and CT images. Our method leverages multilevel deep-aggregated features and multistage training via a mutually beneficial approach to maximize the overall CAD performance. To improve the interpretation of CAD predictions, these multilevel deep features are visualized as additional outputs that can assist radiologists in validating the CAD results. A total of six publicly available datasets were fused to build a single large-scale heterogeneous radiographic collection that was used to analyze the performance of the proposed technique and other baseline methods. To preserve generality of our method, we selected different patient data for training, validation, and testing, and consequently, the data of same patient were not included in training, validation, and testing subsets.

Therefore monitoring pollen levels in ambient air is an important tool in research and health care. Most European monitoring stations collect airborne pollen at rooftop levels for measurements in the larger surrounding of the sampling station, and not in the direct environment of sensitized subjects. Here we present the development and evaluation of a portable pollen sampler, called ""Pollensniffer"", that was designed to collect pollen in the immediate environment of allergic subjects. Validation of the Pollensniffer against the standard volumetric pollen sampler showed for most pollen types high correlations between the number of pollen collected by those two devices (Spearman's Correlation Coefficient > 0.8); the Pollensniffer appeared to collect on average 5.8 times more pollen per hour than the static sampler. Pollen monitoring was performed using this Pollensniffer at street level at 3 different locations in the city of Leiden during 22 weeks in 2017 and 21 weeks in 2018, during three 15-min periods a day and at one day in the week. The results showed that the pollen levels for birch and grass pollen can significantly differ from location to location and per time of day. Furthermore, the Pollensniffer measurements at street level showed that birch and grass pollen grains were detected 1 1/2 and 2-3 weeks, respectively, before detection at rooftop level. The street measurements show that allergic subjects can encounter varying pollen levels throughout the city and that they can be exposed to grass and birch pollen and may experience hay fever symptoms, even before the sampler at rooftop level registers these pollen.","de Weger, Letty A; Molster, Frank; de Raat, Kevin; den Haan, Jeffrey; Romein, Johan; van Leeuwen, Willem; de Groot, Hans; Mostert, Marijke; Hiemstra, Pieter S",Sci Total Environ,277,24

Using the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemiological model we establish that under some mild assumptions the growth rate of COVID-19 deaths is a time-delayed approximation of the growth rate of COVID-19 infections. We then hypothesize that the growth rate of COVID-19 infections is a function of population mobility, which leads to a statistical model that predicts the growth rate of COVID-19 deaths as a delayed function of population mobility. The parameters of the statistical model directly reveal the growth rate of infections, the mobility-dependent transmission rate, the mobility-independent recovery rate, and the critical mobility, below which COVID-19 growth rate becomes negative. We fitted the proposed statistical model on publicly available data from 14 countries where daily death counts exceeded 100 for more than 3 days as of May 6th, 2020. The publicly available Google Mobility Index (GMI) was used as a measure of population mobility at the country level. Our results show that the growth rate of COVID-19 deaths can be accurately estimated 20 days ahead as a quadratic function of the transit category of GMI (adjusted R-squared = 0.784). The estimated 95% confidence interval for the critical mobility is in the range between 36.1% and 47.6% of the pre-COVID-19 mobility. This result indicates that a significant reduction in population mobility is needed to reverse the growth of COVID-19 epidemic. Moreover, the quantitative relationship established herein suggests that a readily available, population-level metric such as GMI can be a useful indicator of the course of COVID-19 epidemic.","Seibold, Benjamin; Vucetic, Zivjena; Vucetic, Slobodan",,277,27

In adjusted analyses, patients with a history of cancer had 1.33 (95% CI = 1.05, 1.69) times the odds of death compared to those without cancer and this appeared to be driven by lung cancer (odds ratio (OR) = 2.44, 95% CI= 1.05, 4.39). Patients with a history of genitourinary cancer were not at higher risk of mortality compared to those without cancer (OR=0.99, 95% CI= 0.61, 1.62). History of cancer was not associated with ICU admission or AKI in overall and subgroup analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a history of cancer who are hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection are not at greater risk for AKI, though they are at higher risk for mortality as compared to patients without a history of cancer. The increased risk in mortality appears driven by patients with pulmonary neoplasms. Patients with a history of genitourinary malignancies do not appear to be at higher risk for AKI or for mortality compared to the general population.","Khusid, Johnathan A; Becerra, Adan Z; Gallante, Blair; Sadiq, Areeba S; Atallah, William M; Badani, Ketan K; Gupta, Mantu",Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,277,20

The literature on previous coronavirus infections reports that patients may experience persistent impairment in respiratory function after being discharged. Our objective was to determine the prevalence of restrictive pattern, obstructive pattern and altered diffusion in patients post-COVID-19 infection and to describe the different evaluations of respiratory function used with these patients. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted in five databases. Studies that used lung function testing to assess post-infection COVID-19 patients were included for review. Two independent reviewers analysed the studies, extracted the data and assessed the quality of evidence. RESULTS: Of the 1973 reports returned by the initial search, seven articles reporting on 380 patients were included in the data synthesis. In the sensitivity analysis, we found a prevalence of 0.39 (CI 0.24-0.56, pâ¯<â¯0.01, I2â¯=â¯86%), 0.15 (CI 0.09-0.22, pâ¯=â¯0.03, I2â¯=â¯59%), and 0.07 (CI 0.04-0.11, pâ¯=â¯0.31, I2â¯=â¯16%) for altered diffusion capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO), restrictive pattern and obstructive pattern, respectively. CONCLUSION: Post-infection COVID-19 patients showed impaired lung function; the most important of the pulmonary function tests affected was the diffusion capacity.","Torres-Castro, R; Vasconcello-Castillo, L; Alsina-Restoy, X; Solis-Navarro, L; Burgos, F; Puppo, H; Vilaró, J","Pulmonology (Barc., Print)",277,13

METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of 313 consecutive hospitalized adult patients (18 years or older) with confirmed COVID-19. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to assess the discriminatory power of the qCSI score and BCRSS prediction rule compared to the CURB-65 score for predicting mortality and intensive care unit admission. RESULTS: The overall in-hospital fatality rate was 32.3%, and the ICU admission rate was 31.3%. The CURB-65 score had the highest numerical AUC to predict in-hospital mortality (AUC 0.781) compared to the qCSI score (AUC 0.711) and the BCRSS prediction rule (AUC 0.663). For ICU admission, the qCSI score had the highest numerical AUC (AUC 0.761) compared to the BCRSS prediction rule (AUC 0.735) and the CURB-65 score (AUC 0.629).

We sought to investigate the balance between procoagulant factors and natural coagulation inhibitors in the critically ill COVID-19 patient and to evaluate the usefulness of hemostasis parameters to identify patients at risk of venous thromboembolic event (VTE). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted an observational study recording VTEs defined as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism using lower limb ultrasound (92% of the patients), computed tomography pulmonary angiography (6%) and both tests (2%). We developed a comprehensive analysis of hemostasis. RESULTS: Ninety-two consecutive mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients (age, 62 years [53-69] (median [25th-75th percentiles]); M/F sex ratio, 2.5; body-mass index, 28 kg/m2 [25-32]; past hypertension (52%) and diabetes mellitus (30%)) admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) from 03/11/2020 to 5/05/2020, were included. When tested, patients were receiving prophylactic (74%) or therapeutic (26%) anticoagulation. Forty patients (43%) were diagnosed with VTE. Patients displayed inflammatory and prothrombotic profile including markedly elevated plasma fibrinogen (7.7 g/L [6.1-8.6]), D-dimer (3,360 ng/mL [1668-7575]), factor V (166 IU/dL [136-195]) and factor VIII activities (294 IU/dL [223-362]). We evidenced significant discrepant protein C anticoagulant and chromogenic activities, combined with slightly decreased protein S activity.

Therefore, this study aimed to determine the overuse of water while scrubbing hands with soap for handwashing when the tap is on amid the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh. Sociodemographic data were collected using a web-based survey tool among 1980 participants and an experiment was conducted among 126 participants to estimate the overuse of water during hand scrubbing while the tap is on. A total of 80% of the participants washed their hands regularly after returning home from outside. About 57.27% of participants did not turn off their tap throughout the handwashing process. A single participant, who kept his tap on throughout the handwashing process, overused approximately 1.7L of water per handwash and 14.9L of water per day. Hand scrubbing with soap keeping the tap on, raised the overuse of water 13-fold during this pandemic compared to the non-pandemic situation which cost an extra 224.95 BDT (2.65$) per day for 1980 participants. Minimize the speed of tap, using automatic taps, and using taps operated by legs might be an effective solution to reduce the water overuse.

CIN was defined as an increase of either 25% or 0.5 mg/dL (44.2 µmol/L) in serum creatinine within 72 hours after contrast infusion. A simple CIN risk score based on independent predictors was established. Four variables were identified for our risk score model: LVEF < 40%, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), eGFR < 60, and contrast volume > 300 mL. Based on this new CIN risk score, the incidence of CIN had a significant trend with increased predicting score values of 5.9%, 32.9%, and 60.0%, corresponding to low, moderate, and high-risk groups, respectively. The novel risk assessment exhibited moderate discrimination ability for predicting CIN, with an AUC of 0.759 [95% CI 0.668-0.852, P = 0.001] in the validation cohort. It also had similar prognostic values for one-year follow-up MACE (C-statistic: 0.705 and 0.606 for new risk score and Mehran score, respectively). This novel risk-prediction model could be effective for preventing nephropathy in diabetic patients receiving contrast media during surgical procedures.","Yao, Zhi-Feng; Shen, Hong; Tang, Min-Na; Yan, Yan; Ge, Jun-Bo",Basic clin. pharmacol. toxicol,277,29

Statistics showed that Ephedra and Glycyrrhiza were frequently used in the treatment of COVID-19. We hypothesized that the Ephedra-Glycyrrhiza drug pair is a potential choice for the treatment of COVID-19. Here, 112 active compounds were identified from Ephedra-Glycyrrhiza via network pharmacology approach. Ephedra-Glycyrrhiza pair enrichment analysis demonstrated that these compounds might participate in the cAMP, PI3K-Akt, JAK-STAT and chemokine signaling pathways, which had a high correlation with respiratory, nervous, blood circulation and digestive system-related diseases. Pathway analysis between Ephedra-Glycyrrhiza and COVID-19 showed that the key targets were TNF-&#945;, IL2, FOS, ALB, and PTGS2. They might control PI3K-Akt signaling pathway to exert immune regulation, organ protection and antiviral effects. Molecular docking results showed that the active compounds from the Ephedra-Glycyrrhiza pair bound well to COVID-19 related targets, including the main protease (Mpro, also called 3CLpro), the spike protein (S protein), and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).

During current COVID19 outbreak, in-person teaching in our institution was held thus creating a unique challenge for clinical skills' teaching. A Case-Based E-Learning activity was designed to replace traditional in-person teaching of renal semiology. E-Learning activities were shown to be effective for knowledge retention and increasing novice learners' performance. However, major knowledge gaps exist concerning the satisfaction of learners with E-Learning activities as a sole mean of teaching, specifically for undergraduate clinical skills education. OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to prospectively assess undergraduate medical students' perceptions and satisfaction from an E-Learning activity teaching renal semiology. METHODS: All second-year medical students (Novice Learners) from the medical faculty of the University undertook the E-Learning activity and were invited to participate in a non-mandatory validated web-based survey using a 1-10 Likert-Scale rating ending with a qualitative open-ended question. Seventeen fourth to sixth year students (Advanced learners) were as well prospectively recruited and undertook both E-Learning activity and evaluation. Mixed-methods analysis was performed. RESULTS: Eighty-eight out of 141 (63%) novice learners and all of advanced learners (100%) responded to the evaluation survey. Advanced learners reported significantly higher satisfaction (8.7 ± 1.0 Vs. 7.3 ± 1.8), p < 0.01), objectives clarity (9.6 ± 0.8 Vs. 7.7 ± 1.7, p < 0.01) and objectives attainability (9.8 ± 0.5 Vs. 7.3 ± 1.3, p < 0.01) from the e-learning activity. Both groups showed high interest in the inclusion of the activity as part of blended learning however low interest in the activity as a sole mean of teaching. CONCLUSIONS: Case-Based E-Learning activities might be better suited for advanced learners and could increase learners' satisfaction within blended teaching instructional design. More research concerning students' satisfaction from E-Learning activities in the field of clinical skills education should be done. Moreover, more effort should be put in finding alternative teaching tools for clinical skills education in light of ongoing and future pandemics.","Zamberg, Ido; Schiffer, Eduardo; Stoermann-Chopard, Catherine",,277,16

We call it Semi-VCAM in which the response could be a functional/longitudinal variable, and the explanatory variables could be a mixture of functional/longitudinal and scalar variables. Notably some of the scalar variables could be categorical variables as well. The Semi-VCAM simultaneously allows for both substantial flexibility and the maintaining of one-dimensional rates of convergence. A local linear smoothing with the aid of an initial B spline series approximation is developed to estimate the unknown functional effects in the model. To avoid the subjective choice between the sparse and dense cases of the data, we establish the asymptotic theories of the resultant Pilot Estimation Based Local Linear Estimators (PEBLLE) on a unified framework of sparse, dense and ultra-dense cases of the data. Moreover, we construct unified consistent tests to justify whether a parsimony submodel is sufficient or not. These test methods also avoid the subjective choice between the sparse, dense and ultra dense cases of the data. Extensive Monte Carlo simulation studies investigating the finite sample performance of the proposed methodologies confirm our asymptotic results. We further illustrate our methodologies via analyzing the COVID-19 data from China and the CD4 data.","Hu, Lixia; Huang, Tao; You, Jinhong",,277,5

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to characterize how mental health practitioners have changed their practices during the pandemic. The authors hypothesize that mental health practitioners would increase tele-mental health services and that certain provider types would be better able to adapt to tele-mental health than others. METHODS: The study surveyed 903 practitioners, primarily psychologists/doctoral-level (Psych/DL) providers, social workers/master's-level (SW/ML) providers, and neuropsychologists employed in academic medical centers or private practices. Differences among providers were examined using Bonferroni-adjusted chi-square tests and one-way Bonferroni-adjusted analyses of covariance. RESULTS: The majority of the 903 mental health practitioners surveyed rapidly adjusted their practices, predominantly by shifting to tele-mental health appointments (n=729, 80.82%). Whereas 80.44% (n=625) were not using tele-mental health in December 2019, only 22.07% (n=188) were not by late March or early April 2020.

Low-wage and minority workers are more likely to work in hazardous industries and are thus at greater risk. Within the small business sector, in particular, the health of low-wage and minority workers is threatened by a multitude of complex and interrelated factors that increase their risk for injuries, death, and even chronic disease. The COVID-19 pandemic has amplified these concerns, as many low-wage and minority workers are essential workers, and many small businesses are reopening with little to no guidance. The article describes work-related health risks and reviews current research on occupational and social ecological approaches to improving the health of minority and low-wage workers primarily employed by small businesses. We propose a conceptual framework that integrates the social ecological model with the hierarchy of controls to address work-related health among low-wage and minority workers specifically in the small business sector. Community-based strategies are recommended to engage small business owners and workers in efforts to address their immediate needs, while building towards sustainable policy change over time.

Existing prognostic models mostly consider the impact of biomarkers at presentation on the risk of a single patient outcome at a single follow up time. We collected data for 553 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)-positive COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital whose eventual outcomes were known. The data collected for the patients included demographics, comorbidities and laboratory values taken at admission and throughout the course of hospitalization. We trained multivariate Markov prognostic models to identify high-risk patients at admission along with a dynamic measure of risk incorporating time-dependent changes in patients' laboratory values. From the set of factors available upon admission, the Markov model determined that age >80 years, history of coronary artery disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease increased mortality risk. The lab values upon admission most associated with mortality included neutrophil percentage, red blood cells (RBC), red cell distribution width (RDW), protein levels, platelets count, albumin levels and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC). Incorporating dynamic changes in lab values throughout hospitalization lead to dramatic gains in the predictive accuracy of the model and indicated a catalogue of variables for determining high-risk patients including eosinophil percentage, white blood cells (WBC), platelets, pCO2, RDW, large unstained cells (LUC) count, alkaline phosphatase and albumin. Our prognostic model highlights the nuance of determining risk for COVID-19 patients and indicates that, rather than a single variable, a range of factors (at different points in hospitalization) are needed for effective risk stratification.","Momeni-Boroujeni, Amir; Mendoza, Rachelle; Stopard, Isaac J; Lambert, Ben; Zuretti, Alejandro",Infect Dis Rep,277,23

Two causes are identified and qualitatively distinguished: morphological similarity and non-essential information interference. The former cause is not model dependent, whereas the latter is inconsistent across all six models. To reduce the misclassifications caused by non-essential information interference, this study erases the pixels within the bonding boxes anchored at the top 5% pixels of the saliency map. This method first verifies the cause; then by directly modifying the cause it reduces the misclassification. Future studies will focus on quantitatively differentiating the two causes of misclassifications, generalizing the anchor-box based inference modification method to reduce misclassification, exploring the interactions of the two causes in misclassifications.","Min, Yan; Bennett, Miles",,277,1

An online survey was created using Google Forms. It was implemented between April 4th and April 17th, 2020. Athletes were consulted about their body mass before starting the quarantine and after 20 ± 5 days of quarantine. RESULTS: athletes in all combat sports were heavier during quarantine as compared to pre-quarantine (p < 0.001, d = 0.12). CONCLUSIONS: combat sports athletes experienced an increase in body mass during the COVID-19 quarantine.","Herrera-Valenzuela, Tomás; Narrea Vargas, José Jairo; Merlo, Rodrigo; Valdés-Badilla, Pablo Antonio; Pardo-Tamayo, Carolina; Franchini, Emerson",Nutr. hosp,277,5

National representative samples were collected from 24 countries (N = 25,435). The main predictors were (1) perceived risk to contract coronavirus, (2) perceived risk to suffer economic losses due to coronavirus, and (3) their interaction effect. Individual and country-level variables were added as covariates in multilevel regression models. We examined compliance with various preventive health behaviors and support for strict containment policies. Results show that perceived economic risk consistently predicted mitigation behavior and policy support-and its effects were positive. Perceived health risk had mixed effects. Only two significant interactions between health and economic risk were identified-both positive.","Nisa, Claudia F; Bélanger, Jocelyn J; Faller, Daiane G; Buttrick, Nicholas R; Mierau, Jochen O; Austin, Maura M K; Schumpe, Birga M; Sasin, Edyta M; Agostini, Maximilian; Gützkow, Ben; Kreienkamp, Jannis; Abakoumkin, Georgios; Abdul Khaiyom, Jamilah Hanum; Ahmedi, Vjollca; Akkas, Handan; Almenara, Carlos A; Atta, Mohsin; Bagci, Sabahat Cigdem; Basel, Sima; Kida, Edona Berisha; Bernardo, Allan B I; Chobthamkit, Phatthanakit; Choi, Hoon-Seok; Cristea, Mioara; Csaba, Sára; Damnjanovic, Kaja; Danyliuk, Ivan; Dash, Arobindu; Di Santo, Daniela; Douglas, Karen M; Enea, Violeta; Fitzsimons, Gavan; Gheorghiu, Alexandra; Gómez, Ángel; Grzymala-Moszczynska, Joanna; Hamaidia, Ali; Han, Qing; Helmy, Mai; Hudiyana, Joevarian; Jeronimus, Bertus F; Jiang, Ding-Yu; Jovanovic, Veljko; Kamenov, Zeljka; Kende, Anna; Keng, Shian-Ling; Kieu, Tra Thi Thanh; Koc, Yasin; Kovyazina, Kamila; Kozytska, Inna; Krause, Joshua",Sci Rep,277,24

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of endostatin on Wnt signaling pathway of stem-like cells in bladder cancer in tumor microenvironment. The qRT-PCR assay and western blot were conducted to evaluate related factors expressions of Wnt signaling pathway in both bladder cancer 5637 cells and stem cells. Loss of function assays were carried out to detect the influence of endostatin on the proliferation, migration, cell proliferation and apoptosis of bladder cancer cells. We demonstrated that endostatin triggered the degradation of ß-catenin, a key mediator of Wnt signaling. The activation of the endostatin blocked ß-catenin function and inhibited cell growth and migration of bladder cancer. In order to verify that the Wnt/ß-catenin signaling pathway was inhibited by endostain in 5637 bladder cancer cells and stem cells, the Wnt/ß-catenin signaling pathway-associated molecules, including DKK1, LRP5, TCF4, ß-catenin, cyclin D1, and c-Myc, were evaluated in 5637 bladder cancer cells and stem cells. The western blotting results showed that expressions of these molecules were remarkably increased in the 5637 bladder cancer cells and stem cells compared to the control group. In summary, our study demonstrated that endostatin inhibited angiogenesis. The downregulation of the Wnt/ß-catenin pathway may be engaged in the suppression of angiogenesis by endostatin in bladder cancer cells and cancer stem cells.","Wu, Tao; Duan, Xi; Hu, Tinghui; Mu, Xiaoxi; Jiang, Guo; Cui, Shu",Mol.

MAIN TEXT: We review the current data on the epidemiology, the possible underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms, and the therapeutic implications of PE in relation to COVID-19. The incidence of PE is reported to be around 2.6-8.9% of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients and up to one-third of those requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission, despite standard prophylactic anticoagulation. This may be explained by direct and indirect pathologic consequences of COVID-19, complement activation, cytokine release, endothelial dysfunction, and interactions between different types of blood cells. CONCLUSION: Thromboprophylaxis should be started in all patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 admitted to the hospital. The use of an intermediate therapeutic dose of low molecular weight (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin can be considered on an individual basis in patients with multiple risk factors for venous thromboembolism, including critically ill patients admitted to the ICU. Decisions about extending prophylaxis with LMWH after hospital discharge should be made after balancing the reduced risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) with the risk of increased bleeding events and should be continued for 7-14 days after hospital discharge or in the pre-hospital phase in case of pre-existing or persisting VTE risk factors. Therapeutic anticoagulation is the cornerstone in the management of patients with PE. Selection of an appropriate agent and correct dosing requires consideration of underlying comorbidities.","Sakr, Yasser; Giovini, Manuela; Leone, Marc; Pizzilli, Giacinto; Kortgen, Andreas; Bauer, Michael; Tonetti, Tommaso; Duclos, Gary; Zieleskiewicz, Laurent; Buschbeck, Samuel; Ranieri, V Marco; Antonucci, Elio",Ann Intensive Care,277,5

The first step in PR is assessment of patient's exercise capacity which allows individualized prescription of safe and effective exercise program. With COVID-19 pandemics assessment of patients in PR centers has been limited resulting in significant reduction of patients undergoing life-saving PR. The goal of this pilot study was to introduce approaches for remote assessment of exercise capacity using videoconferencing platforms and provide initial usability assessment of this approach by conducing cognitive walkthrough testing. We developed a remote assessment system that supports comprehensive physical therapy assessment necessary for prescription of a personalized exercise program tailored to individual fitness level and limitations in gait and balance of the patient under evaluation. Usability was assessed by conducting cognitive walkthrough and system usability surveys. The usability inspection of the remote exercise assessment demonstrated overall high acceptance by all study participants. Our next steps in developing user-centered interface should include usability evaluation in different subgroups of patients with varying socio-economic background, different age groups, computer skills, literacy and numeracy.","Finkelstein, Joseph; Jeong, In Cheol; Doerstling, Mackenzie; Shen, Yichao; Wei, Chenhao; Karpatkin, Herbert",Stud Health Technol Inform,277,16

Mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) therapies, which have been explored for decades as a treatment for inflammatory diseases, are now being called into action to combat the cytokine storm induced by COVID-19. The severity of COVID-19 may be due in part to the patient's response to the infection. In some patients, the virus induces an outpouring of inflammatory mediators that leads to swelling, inflammatory infiltration, and reduced gas exchange in the alveoli of the lungs. To combat this cytokine storm, over 20 clinical trials aiming to treat COVID-19 with MSCs have been registered with ClinicalTrials.gov. Leng et al. recently conducted a pilot study of MSC transplantation in 10 patients in China. All patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction and had fever, shortness of breath, cough, and oxygen saturation at rest &lt;95%. Seven of the patients received intravenous infusions of allogeneic MSCs while three received saline as a placebo control. All seven MSC treated patients experienced resolution of symptoms while one of the placebo-treated patients went on to develop ARDS and another died. The response of the most severely ill patient treated with MSCs was monitored throughout recovery. Of note, C-reactive protein levels dropped 10-fold after MSC treatment, suggesting a drop in systemic inflammation. Analysis of cytokine levels before and after treatment revealed that MSC treatment, but not placebo, was associated with a halt in the increase of serum tumor necrosis factor–α and an increase in anti-inflammatory interleukin-10 concentrations in the serum. Although this study is not designed to make definitive claims regarding the efficacy of MSC therapy for COVID-19 or the mechanisms by which MSCs may function to prevent or treat cytokine storm, it does provide important safety data and hints of efficacy that have motivated further exploration of MSCs as a treatment for COVID-19. Of particular note is a randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled, Phase 2/3 trial enrolling 240 patients being conducted through a public-private partnership between the U.S. National Institutes of Health–funded Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network and Mesoblast. As multiple clinical trials are launched around the world, we should not have to wait long to determine if MSCs are a viable and effective treatment option for severe COVID-19.","Ankrum, James",Sci.

Numerous observational studies have reported an association between the A blood group and an increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our objective was to investigate the frequency and clinical course of COVID-19 in a large sample of patients who had undergone TAVR and to determine the associations of the ABO blood group with disease occurrence and outcomes. Patients who had undergone TAVR between 2010 and 2019 were included in this study and followed-up through the recent COVID-19 outbreak. The occurrence and severity (hospitalization and/or death) of COVID-19 and their associations with the ABO blood group served as the main outcome measures. Of the 1125 patients who had undergone TAVR, 403 (36%) died before 1 January 2020, and 20 (1.8%) were lost to follow-up. The study sample therefore consisted of 702 patients. Of them, we identified 22 cases (3.1%) with COVID-19. Fourteen patients (63.6%) were hospitalized or died of disease. Multivariable analysis identified the A blood group (vs. others) as the only independent predictor of COVID-19 in patients who had undergone TAVR (odds ratio (OR) = 6.32; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.11-18.92; p = 0.001). The A blood group (vs. others; OR = 8.27; 95% CI = 1.83-37.43, p = 0.006) and a history of cancer (OR = 4.99; 95% CI = 1.64-15.27, p = 0.005) were significantly and independently associated with disease severity (hospitalization and/or death). We conclude that patients who have undergone TAVR frequently have a number of cardiovascular comorbidities that may work to increase the risk of COVID-19. The subgroup with the A blood group was especially prone to developing the disease and showed unfavorable outcomes.","Kibler, Marion; Dietrich, Laurent; Kanso, Mohamad; Carmona, Adrien; Marchandot, Benjamin; Matsushita, Kensuke; Trimaille, Antonin; How-Choong, Cécile; Odier, Albane; Gennesseaux, Gabrielle; Schramm, Ophélie; Reydel, Antje; Hess, Sébastien; Sato, Chisato; Caillard, Sophie; Jesel, Laurence; Morel, Olivier; Ohlmann, Patrick",,277,16

Therefore, promoting industry and business to resume work safely has become an important step to be taken by all countries in overcoming the economic recession and restarting growth. Objective: This study aims to elaborate on epidemic prevention measures a Chinese company (Company C) took during work resumption. Methods: In this study, we used a case study design, with field research method applied to data collection and analysis. Results: It has been identified that Company C took a range of measures to prevent the outbreak of COVID-19 inside the company, which involve work resumption preparation (information survey, health training, work resumption plan, epidemic prevention plan), facilities management, materials management, employee activity management, and so on. Conclusion: When the COVID-19 epidemic was initially controlled in February, the Chinese government allowed enterprises to resume work voluntarily, which did not bring about a rebound in the epidemic. One important reason is that Chinese enterprises have taken multiple measures to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Company C's practices could shed some light on how companies in Western countries resume their work during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Zhang, Quan; Wu, Yijin; Li, Meiyu; Li, Linzi",Front Public Health,277,20

Effective social distancing, unless enforced as drastic lockdowns and mandatory cordon sanitaire, requires consistent strict collective adherence. However, it remains unknown what the determinants for the resultant compliance of social distancing and their impact on disease mitigation are. Here, we incorporate into the epidemiological process with an evolutionary game theory model that governs the evolution of social distancing behavior. In our model, we assume an individual acts in their best interest and their decisions are driven by adaptive social learning of the real-time risk of infection in comparison with the cost of social distancing. We find interesting oscillatory dynamics of social distancing accompanied with waves of infection. Moreover, the oscillatory dynamics are dampened with a nontrivial dependence on model parameters governing decision-makings and gradually cease when the cumulative infections exceed the herd immunity. Compared to the scenario without social distancing, we quantify the degree to which social distancing mitigates the epidemic and its dependence on individuals' responsiveness and rationality in their behavior changes. Our work offers new insights into leveraging human behavior in support of pandemic response.","Glaubitz, Alina; Fu, Feng",,277,16

This study aimed to examine the acute mental health impacts of the COVID-19 crisis as well as coping strategies employed by disadvantaged community members in North India. METHODS: We used an intersectional lens for this qualitative study set in rural Tehri Garwhal and urban Dehradun districts of Uttarakhand, India. In-depth interviews were conducted in May 2020 during lockdown, by phone and in person using purposive selection, with people with disabilities, people living in slums with psychosocial disabilities and widows (total n = 24). We used the framework method for analysis following steps of transcription and translation, familiarisation, coding, developing and then applying a framework, charting and then interpreting data. FINDINGS: The participants with compounded disadvantage had almost no access to mobile phones, health messaging or health care and experienced extreme mental distress and despair, alongside hunger and loss of income. Under the realms of intrapersonal, interpersonal and social, six themes related to mental distress emerged: feeling overwhelmed and bewildered, feeling distressed and despairing, feeling socially isolated, increased events of othering and discrimination, and experiencing intersectional disadvantage. The six themes summarising coping strategies in the COVID-19 crisis were: finding sense and meaning, connecting with others, looking for positive ways forward, innovating with new practices, supporting others individually and collectively, and engaging with the natural world. CONCLUSIONS: People intersectionally disadvantaged by their social identity experienced high levels of mental distress during the COVID-19 crisis, yet did not collapse, and instead described diverse and innovative strategies which enabled them to cope through the COVID-19 lockdown. This study illustrates that research using an intersectional lens is valuable to design equitable policy such as the need for access to digital resources, and that disaggregated data is needed to address social inequities at the intersection of poverty, disability, caste, religious discrimination and gender inherent in the COVID-19 pandemic in India.","Mathias, Kaaren; Rawat, Meenal; Philip, Sharad; Grills, Nathan",Int J Equity Health,277,16

Both direct and indirect consequences from COVID-19 infection are recognized to give rise to cardio- and cerebrovascular complications. Despite current limited knowledge on COVID-19 pathogenesis, inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and coagulopathy appear to play critical roles in COVID-19-associated cerebrovascular disease (CVD). One of the major subtypes of CVD is cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) which represents a spectrum of pathological processes of various etiologies affecting the brain microcirculation that can trigger subsequent neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Prevalent with aging, CSVD is a recognized risk factor for stroke, vascular dementia, and Alzheimer's disease. In the background of COVID-19 infection, the heightened cellular activations from inflammations and oxidative stress may result in elevated levels of microthrombogenic extracellular-derived circulating microparticles (MPs). Consequently, MPs could act as pro-coagulant risk factor that may serve as microthrombi for the vulnerable microcirculation in the brain leading to CSVD manifestations. This review aims to appraise the accumulating body of evidence on the plausible impact of COVID-19 infection on the formation of microthrombogenic MPs that could lead to microthrombosis in CSVD manifestations, including occult CSVD which may last well beyond the pandemic era.","Che Mohd Nassir, Che Mohd Nasril; Hashim, Sabarisah; Wong, Kah Keng; Abdul Halim, Sanihah; Idris, Nur Suhaila; Jayabalan, Nanthini; Guo, Dazhi; Mustapha, Muzaimi",Mol Neurobiol,277,29

We take on this task by converting the symptom onset time distribution, which we calibrated, into the percentage of the latent, pre-symptomatic and symptomatic groups through a novel mathematical procedure. We then estimate the reduction of the basic reproduction number $R_0$ under specific disease control practices such as contact tracing, testing, social distancing, wearing masks and staying at home. When these measures are implemented in parallel, their effects on $R_0$ multiply. For example, if 70% of the general public wear masks and contact tracing is conducted at 60% efficiency within a 4-day time frame, epidemic growth will be flattened in the hardest hit countries. Finally, we analyze the bell-shaped curves of epidemic evolution from various affected regions and point out the significance of a universal decay rate of -0.32/day in the final eradication of the disease.","Tian, Liang; Li, Xuefei; Qi, Fei; Tang, Qian-Yuan; Tang, Viola; Liu, Jiang; Li, Zhiyuan; Cheng, Xingye; Li, Xuanxuan; Shi, Yingchen; Liu, Haiguang; Tang, Lei-Han",,277,20

Increasing attention is being paid to ridehailing platforms and connections between demand and continuous innovation in service features; one of these features is dynamic ride-pooling. To disentangle how ridehailing impacts existing transportation networks and its ability to support economic vitality and community livability it is essential to consider the distribution of demand across diverse communities. In this paper we expand the literature on ridehailing demand by exploring community variation and spatial dependence in ridehailing use. Specifically, we investigate the diffusion and role of solo requests versus ride-pooling to shed light on how different mobility services, with different environmental and accessibility implications, are used by diverse communities. This paper employs a Social Disadvantage Index, Transit Access Analysis, and a Spatial Durbin Model to investigate the influence of both local and spatial spillover effects on the demand for shared and solo ridehailing. The analysis of 127 million ridehailing rides, of which 15% are pooled, confirms the presence of spatial effects. Results indicate that density and vibrancy variables have analogue effects, both direct and indirect, on demand for solo vs pooled rides. Instead, our analysis reveals significant contrasting effects for socio-economic disadvantage, which is positively correlated with ride-pooling and negatively with solo rides. Additionally, we find that higher rail transit access is associated with higher demand for both solo and pooled ridehailing along with substantial spatial spillovers. We discuss implications for policy, operations and research related to the novel insight on how pooled ridesourcing relate to geography, living conditions, and transit interactions.","Soria, Jason; Stathopoulos, Amanda",,277,16

The number of measures used, and the range of measures applied, have far exceeded previous public health emergencies of international concern. However, efforts to advance research, policy and practice to support their effective use has been hindered by a lack of clear and consistent definition. RESULTS: Based on a review of existing datasets for cross-border health measures, such as the Oxford Coronavirus Government Response Tracker and World Health Organization Public Health and Social Measures, along with analysis of secondary and grey literature, we propose six categories to define measures more clearly and consistently - policy goal, type of movement (travel and trade), adopted by public or private sector, level of jurisdiction applied, stage of journey, and degree of restrictiveness. These categories are then brought together into a proposed typology that can support research with generalizable findings and comparative analyses across jurisdictions. Addressing the current gaps in evidence about travel measures, including how different jurisdictions apply such measures with varying effects, in turn, enhances the potential for evidence-informed decision-making based on fuller understanding of policy trade-offs and externalities. Finally, through the adoption of standardized terminology and creation of an agreed evidentiary base recognized across jurisdictions, the typology can support efforts to strengthen coordinated global responses to outbreaks and inform future efforts to revise the WHO International Health Regulations (2005). CONCLUSIONS: The widespread use of cross-border health measures during the COVID-19 pandemic has prompted significant reflection on available evidence, previous practice and existing legal frameworks. The typology put forth in this paper aims to provide a starting point for strengthening research, policy and practice.","Lee, Kelley; Grépin, Karen A; Worsnop, Catherine; Marion, Summer; Piper, Julianne; Song, Mingqi",Global Health,277,1

We estimated the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection and outbreaks among staff and students in educational settings during the summer half-term (June-July, 2020) in England. METHODS: In this prospective, cross-sectional analysis, Public Health England initiated enhanced national surveillance in educational settings in England that had reopened after the first national lockdown, from June 1 to July 17, 2020. Educational settings were categorised as early years settings (<5-year-olds), primary schools (5-11-year-olds; only years 1 and 6 allowed to return), secondary schools (11-18-year-olds; only years 10 and 12), or mixed-age settings (spanning a combination of the above). Further education colleges were excluded. Data were recorded in HPZone, an online national database for events that require public health management. RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 event rates and case rates were calculated for staff and students, and direction of transmission was inferred on the basis of symptom onset and testing dates. Events were classified as single cases, coprimary cases (at least two confirmed cases within 48 h, typically within the same household), and outbreaks (at least two epidemiologically linked cases, with sequential cases diagnosed within 14 days in the same educational setting). All events were followed up for 28 days after educational settings closed for the summer holidays. Negative binomial regression was used to correlate educational setting events with regional population, population density, and community incidence. FINDINGS: A median of 38â000 early years settings (IQR 35â500-41â500), 15â600 primary schools (13â450-17â300), and 4000 secondary schools (3700-4200) were open each day, with a median daily attendance of 928â000 students (630â000-1â230â000) overall. There were 113 single cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection, nine coprimary cases, and 55 outbreaks. The risk of an outbreak increased by 72% (95% CI 28-130) for every five cases per 100â000 population increase in community incidence (p<0·0001). Staff had higher incidence than students (27 cases [95% CI 23-32] per 100â000 per day among staff compared with 18 cases [14-24] in early years students, 6·0 cases [4·3-8·2] in primary schools students, and 6·8 cases [2·7-14] in secondary school students]), and most cases linked to outbreaks were in staff members (154 [73%] staff vs 56 [27%] children of 210 total cases). Probable direction of transmission was staff to staff in 26 outbreaks, staff to student in eight outbreaks, student to staff in 16 outbreaks, and student to student in five outbreaks. The median number of secondary cases in outbreaks was one (IQR 1-2) for student index cases and one (1-5) for staff index cases. INTERPRETATION: SARS-CoV-2 infections and outbreaks were uncommon in educational settings during the summer half-term in England. The strong association with regional COVID-19 incidence emphasises the importance of controlling community transmission to protect educational settings. Interventions should focus on reducing transmission in and among staff.

The SARS-CoV-2 novel coronavirus has high transmission rate, is more aggressive and virulent in comparison to previously known coronaviruses. It primarily attacks the respiratory system by inducing cytokine storm that causes systemic inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis. Decorin is a pluripotent molecule belonging to a leucine rich proteoglycan group that exerts critical role in extracellular matrix (ECM) assembly and regulates cell growth, adhesion, proliferation, inflammation, and fibrogenesis. Interestingly, decorin has potent anti-inflammatory, cytokine inhibitory, and anti-fibrillogenesis effects which make it a potential drug candidate against the COVID-19 related complications especially in the context of lung fibrosis. Herein, we postulate that owing to its distinctive pharmacological actions and immunomodulatory effect, decorin can be a promising preclinical therapeutic agent for the therapy of COVID-19.","Allawadhi, Prince; Singh, Vishakha; Khurana, Isha; Rawat, Pushkar Singh; Renushe, Akshata Patangrao; Khurana, Amit; Navik, Umashanker; Allwadhi, Sachin; Kumar Karlapudi, Satish; Banothu, Anil Kumar; Bharani, Kala Kumar",Med Hypotheses,277,21

Here, we use deep learning for feature extraction based on a bi-path network (B-Net). After training, the B-Net acquires the prototypical pulses and the ability of both pulse recognition and feature extraction without a priori assigned parameters. The B-Net performance is evaluated on generated datasets and further applied to experimental data of DNA and protein translocation. The B-Net results show remarkably small relative errors and stable trends. The B-Net is further shown capable of processing data with a signal-to-noise ratio equal to one, an impossibility for threshold-based algorithms. The developed B-Net is generic for pulse-like signals beyond pulsed nanopore currents.","Dematties, Dario; Wen, Chenyu; P'erez, Mauricio David; Zhou, Dian; Zhang, Shi-Li",,277,24

However, if collected over country or regional scales, these metrics hide important smaller-scale, local dynamics. We examine how commonly used epidemiological metrics differ for each individual state within the United States during the initial COVID-19 outbreak. We found that the detected case number and trajectory of early detected cases differ considerably between states. We then test for correlations with testing protocols, interventions and population characteristics. We find that epidemic dynamics were most strongly associated with non-pharmaceutical government actions during the early phase of the epidemic. In particular, early social distancing restrictions, particularly on restaurant operations, was correlated with increased doubling times. Interestingly, we also found that states with little tolerance for deviance from enforced rules saw faster early epidemic growth. Together with other correlates such as population density, our results highlight the different factors involved in the heterogeneity in the early spread of COVID-19 throughout the United States. Although individual states are clearly not independent, they can serve as small, natural experiments in how different demographic patterns and government responses can impact the course of an epidemic.","White, Easton R; Hébert-Dufresne, Laurent",PLoS One,277,1

Rapid and innovative advances in digital media offer opportunities for health education, which could result in increased preventive behaviors. This study assessed preventive behaviors against contracting COVID-19 and tested mediation pathways linking four types of digital media consumption (social media, mobile social networking apps [MSNs], online news media, and social live steaming services [SLSSs]) to preventive behaviors, mediated by worry. Results from an online survey (N = 511) revealed that the vast majority (>90 percent) of respondents had very often or always practiced preventive behaviors against contracting COVID-19 such as washing their hands more regularly with soap and water, staying away from crowded places, and wearing face masks out in public. In addition, COVID-19 information seeking through the four types of digital media was a salient parameter that encouraged people to practice preventive behaviors either directly or indirectly. Specifically, seeking COVID-19-related information on MSNs, SLSSs, and online news media was directly associated with preventive behaviors. Whereas COVID-19 information consumption on social media, MSNs, and SLSSs during the infectious disease outbreak could elicit intense worry and, in turn, increase preventive behaviors. The reasons for and implications of the results are discussed.","Liu, Piper Liping",Cyberpsychology behav. soc. netw. (Print),277,13

METHODS: In a cross-sectional, observational study all consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis at the central referral center of these patients in northeast of Iran were included. Ocular examinations (external and slit) were randomly performed for the patients who were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and six COVID wards of the hospital. Moreover, Chart records and serum chemistry results were collected. RESULTS: A total of 142 patients with the mean age of 62.6 ± 15 years (range: 23-96 years) and almost equal gender distribution (male: N = 77, 54.2%) were included in the study. During the initial external examination by the ophthalmologist, 44 (31%) patients were found to have conjunctival hyperemia and 22 (15.5%) patients had chemosis. Consecutive slit examination showed 41 (28.9%) conjunctival hyperemia, 22 (15.5%) chemosis, 11 (7.7%) cataract, and 9 (6.3%) diabetic retinopathy. The patients with at least one ocular manifestation had significantly higher blood urea levels at the time of admission compared to those with no obvious ocular involvement (median: 41.5, IQR: 28-66.3 vs. median: 33, IQR: 23.8-51.8, P = .023). Moreover, a significant difference was observed in the total white blood cell count, lymphocyte percent, neutrophil count, Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), and blood urea level between patients with positive and negative Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 virus. None of the patients reported ocular symptoms prior to systemic involvement. The proportion of patients with at least one ocular manifestation was significantly higher in those admitted in the ICU compared to the non-ICU wards. wards. While conjunctival hyperemia was the most prevalent ocular finding in all patients, chemosis was the most common ocular manifestation in ICU admitted patients. CONCLUSION: Ocular manifestation was observed in more than half of our COVID-19 patients. Hence, it seems important to involve ophthalmologist in the diagnosis and management of these patients.","Abrishami, Mojtaba; Tohidinezhad, Fariba; Daneshvar, Ramin; Omidtabrizi, Arash; Amini, Mahnaz; Sedaghat, Alireza; Amini, Shahram; Reihani, Hamidreza; Allahyari, Abolghasem; Seddigh-Shamsi, Mohsen; Tayyebi, Mohammad; Naderi, Hamidreza; Bojdy, Amin; Khodashahi, Rozita; Eslami, Saeid",Ocul Immunol Inflamm,277,1

With different control policies from local and state government, the COVID-19 outbreak has dramatically changed mobility behavior in affected cities. This study has been investigating the impact of COVID-19 on the number of people involved in crashes accounting for the intensity of different control measures using Negative Binomial (NB) method. Based on a comprehensive dataset of people involved in crashes aggregated in New York City during January 1, 2020 to May 24, 2020, people involved in crashes with respect to travel behavior, traffic characteristics and socio-demographic characteristics are found. The results show that the average person miles traveled on the main traffic mode per person per day, percentage of work trip have positive effect on person involved in crashes. On the contrary, unemployment rate and inflation rate have negative effects on person involved in crashes. Interestingly, different level of control policies during COVID-19 outbreak are closely associated with safety awareness, driving and travel behavior, and thus has an indirect influence on the frequency of crashes. Comparing to other three control policies including emergence declare, limits on mass gatherings, and ban on all nonessential gathering, the negative relationship between stay-at-home policy implemented in New York City from March 20, 2020 and the number of people involved crashes is found in our study.","Zhang, Jie; Feng, Baoheng; Wu, Yina; Xu, Pengpeng; Ke, Ruimin; Dong, Ni",PLoS One,277,26

Yet, establishing the causal effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) is difficult because they do not occur arbitrarily. We exploit a quasi-random source of variation for identification purposes -namely, regional differences in the placement on the pandemic curve following an unexpected and nationwide lockdown. Our results reveal that regions where the outbreak had just started when the lockdown was implemented had 1.62 fewer daily deaths per 100,000 inhabitants when compared to regions for which the lockdown arrived 10+ days after the pandemic's outbreak. As a result, a total of 4,642 total deaths (232 deaths/daily) could have been avoided by the end of our period of study -a figure representing 23% of registered deaths in Spain at the time. We rule out differential pre-COVID mortality trends and self-distancing behaviors across the compared regions prior to the swift lockdown, which was also uniformly observed nationwide. In addition, we provide supporting evidence for contagion deceleration as the main mechanism behind the effectiveness of the early adoption of NPIs in lowering the death rate, rather than an increased healthcare capacity.","Amuedo-Dorantes, Catalina; Borra, Cristina; Rivera-Garrido, Noelia; Sevilla, Almudena",Econ Hum Biol,277,21

Though complete lockdown is epidemiologically effective, because it eliminates infectious contacts, it comes with significant costs. Several recent studies have suggested that a plausible compromise strategy for minimizing epidemic risk is periodic closure, in which populations oscillate between wide-spread social restrictions and relaxation. However, no underlying theory has been proposed to predict and explain optimal closure periods as a function of epidemiological and social parameters. In this work we develop such an analytical theory for SEIR-like model diseases, showing how characteristic closure periods emerge that minimize the total outbreak, and increase predictably with the reproductive number and incubation periods of a disease, as long as both are within predictable limits. Using our approach we demonstrate a sweet-spot effect in which optimal periodic closure is maximally effective for diseases with similar incubation and recovery periods. Our results compare well to numerical simulations, including in COVID-19 models where infectivity and recovery show significant variability.","Hindes, Jason; Bianco, Simone; Schwartz, Ira B.",,277,24

Researchers and experts recommended the development of a community online and in remote instruction, but most teachers felt overwhelmed and unable to rise to the challenge. Juvenile delinquents responded by most students disappearing from school attendance rolls. A grand theme, to shift the nature of online learning, is offered based upon the convergence of the research findings.

However, its protective effects against aristolochic acid (AA)-induced renal injury have not been elucidated yet. The present study was undertaken to elucidate the renoprotective effect of PX on Wistar male rats via activating Keap1-Nrf2/ARE pathway. Experimental animals were randomized into four groups, such as control group, I/R group, AA (5 mg/kg/d; ip for 10 days), and AA-induced rats treated with PX (10 and 20 mg/kg/d; po for 20 days). At the end of the experimental period, the rats were killed, and the biochemical parameters denoting renal functions were evaluated; histological analysis displaying the renal tissue architecture, real-time quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis of Keap1-Nrf2/ARE genes were elucidated. The results demonstrated that the rats administered with AA displayed a significant increase in the blood urea nitrogen level with an increased urine creatinine and protein excretion. Also, the serum levels of urea, uric acid, and albumin levels were increased. Furthermore, the histological evaluation denoted the cellular degeneration with increased tissue lipid peroxidation levels. In contrast, rats administered with PX significantly prevented the tissue degeneration with improved antioxidant levels. Conversely, PX treatment increased the messenger RNA expression of Nrf2, NQO1, HO-1 with an attenuated expression of 4HNE and NOX-4 levels in IHC analysis. Thus, the results of the present study suggest that PX could suppress AA-induced renal failure by suppressing oxidative stress through the activation of Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway.","Guo, Yinxue; Hu, Maorong; Ma, Juan; Chinnathambi, Arunachalam; Alharbi, Sulaiman Ali; Shair, Omar H M; Ge, Pingyu",J Biochem Mol Toxicol,277,33

Even if we know part of the biological aspects of SARS-CoV-2, (viral replication cycle, parameters and dynamics of transmissibility), in the absence of specific treatment, this paucy-symptomatic respiratory infection in the vast majority of cases, leads to mortality in about 1% of the cases and a morbidity of 10%. This resulted in a deep tension of our healthcare system. The diagnosis is based on the association of clinical signs of low respiratory infection and direct detection of the virus by PCR or indirect radiological pulmonary lesions. Very symptomatic and severe forms most often require hospital treatment. Once the diagnosis has been made, management is based on the recognition of severe cases and on symptomatic therapeutic measures: oxygenation, antibiotic therapy to prevent secondary infection, anticoagulation and hydration. Anti-viral treatments and immune-modulators for the second phase of the disease linked to a cytokine storm are being evaluated. Prevention is an essential element using specific patient path, protection of patients and caregivers by “droplets” and “contact” isolation (mask, personal hygiene, hydro-alcoholic solution) and physical and social distancing.

Severely symptomatic COVID-19 is associated with lung inflammation, pneumonia, and respiratory failure, thereby raising concerns of elevated risk of COVID-19-associated mortality among lung cancer patients. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the major receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry into lung cells. The single-cell expression landscape of ACE2 and other SARS-CoV-2-related genes in pulmonary tissues of lung cancer patients remains unknown. We sought to delineate single-cell expression profiles of ACE2 and other SARS-CoV-2-related genes in pulmonary tissues of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients. We examined the expression levels and cellular distribution of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2-priming proteases TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4 in 5 LUADs and 14 matched normal tissues by single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis. scRNA-seq of 186,916 cells revealed epithelial-specific expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and TMPRSS4. Analysis of 70,030 LUAD- and normal-derived epithelial cells showed that ACE2 levels were highest in normal alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells and that TMPRSS2 was expressed in 65% of normal AT2 cells. Conversely, the expression of TMPRSS4 was highest and most frequently detected (75%) in lung cells with malignant features. ACE2-positive cells co-expressed genes implicated in lung pathobiology, including COPD-associated HHIP, and the scavengers CD36 and DMBT1. Notably, the viral scavenger DMBT1 was significantly positively correlated with ACE2 expression in AT2 cells. We describe normal and tumor lung epithelial populations that express SARS-CoV-2 receptor and proteases, as well as major host defense genes, thus comprising potential treatment targets for COVID-19 particularly among lung cancer patients.","Han, Guangchun; Sinjab, Ansam; Hara, Kieko; Treekitkarnmongkol, Warapen; Brennan, Patrick; Chang, Kyle; Bogatenkova, Elena; Sanchez-Espiridion, Beatriz; Behrens, Carmen; Solis, Luisa M; Gao, Boning; Girard, Luc; Zhang, Jianjun; Sepesi, Boris; Cascone, Tina; Byers, Lauren A; Gibbons, Don L; Chen, Jichao; Moghaddam, Seyed Javad; Ostrin, Edwin J; Scheet, Paul; Fujimoto, Junya; Shay, Jerry; Heymach, John V; Minna, John D; Dubinett, Steven; Wistuba, Ignacio I; Stevenson, Christopher S; Spira, Avrum E; Wang, Linghua; Kadara, Humam",,277,1

Here, we present a case study from Auckland, New Zealand, an isolated Southern Hemisphere city, which is largely unaffected by long-range pollution transport or industrial sources of air pollution. In this city, traffic flows reduced by 60-80% as a result of a government-led initiative to contain the virus by limiting all transport to only essential services. In this paper, ambient pollutant concentrations of NO2, O3, BC, PM2.5, and PM10 are compared between the lockdown period and comparable periods in the historical air pollution record, while taking into account changes in the local meteorology. We show that this 'natural experiment' in source emission reductions had significant but non-linear impacts on air quality. While emission inventories and receptor modelling approaches confirm the dominance of traffic sources for NOx (86%), and BC (72%) across the city, observations suggest a consequent reduction in NO2 of only 34-57% and a reduction in BC of 55-75%. The observed reductions in PM2.5 (still likely to be dominated by traffic emissions), and PM10 (dominated by sea salt, traffic emissions to a lesser extent, and affected by seasonality) were found to be significantly less (8-17% for PM2.5 and 7-20% for PM10). The impact of this unplanned controlled intervention shows the importance of establishing accurate, local-scale emission inventories, and the potential of the local atmospheric chemistry and meteorology in limiting their accuracy.","Patel, Hamesh; Talbot, Nick; Salmond, Jennifer; Dirks, Kim; Xie, Shanju; Davy, Perry",Sci Total Environ,277,29

This supralinear synaptic integration is subject to modulation by inhibition. However, the specific rules by which different subtypes of interneurons affect the modulation have remained largely elusive. To examine how inhibition influences active synaptic integration, we optogenetically manipulated the activity of two subtypes of interneurons: dendrite-targeting somatostatin-expressing (SST) interneurons and perisomatic-targeting parvalbumin-expressing (PV) interneurons. In acute slices of mouse primary visual cortex, electrical stimulation evoked nonlinear synaptic integration that depended on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Optogenetic activation of SST interneurons in conjunction with electrical stimulation resulted in predominantly divisive inhibitory gain control, reducing the magnitude of the supralinear response without affecting its threshold. PV interneuron activation, on the other hand, had a minimal effect on the supralinear response. Taken together, these results delineate the roles for SST and PV neurons in active synaptic integration. Differential effects of inhibition by SST and PV interneurons likely increase the computational capacity of the pyramidal neurons in modulating the nonlinear integration of synaptic output.Significance StatementThe principal function of neurons is to integrate a barrage of synaptic inputs and convert them into spike output. Such integration of inputs in the sensory neocortex ensures the transformation of environmental stimuli into a meaningful perception of the outside world. Synaptic integration in neuronal dendrites is shaped by passive electrical properties, active voltage-gated mechanisms, and inhibition from interneurons.

Decontamination is mandatory to avoid harm and contain hazardous materials, but can delay care. Therefore, the stabilization of patients in the warm zone seems reasonable, but research is limited. Moreover, subjects involved in biological events are considered infectious even after decontamination and need to be managed while wearing personal protective equipment (PPE), as seen with Ebola and COVID-19 pandemic. With this simulation mannequin trial, we assessed the impact of CBRNe PPE on cardiopulmonary resuscitation and combat casualty care procedures. METHODS: We compared procedures performed by emergency medicine and anesthesiology senior residents, randomized in 2 groups (CBRNe PPE vs. no PPE). Chest compression (CC) depth was defined as the primary outcome. Time to completion was calculated for the following: tourniquet application; tension pneumothorax needle decompression; peripheral venous access (PVA) and intraosseous access positioning; and drug preparation and administration. A questionnaire was delivered to evaluate participants' perception. RESULTS: Thirty-six residents participated. No significant difference between the groups in CC depth (mean difference = 0.26 cm [95% confidence interval = -0.26 to 0.77 cm, P = 0.318]), as well as for CC rate, CC complete release, and time for drugs preparation and administration was detected. The PPE contributed to significantly higher times for tourniquet application, tension pneumothorax decompression, peripheral venous access, and intraosseous access positioning. The residents found simulation relevant to the residencies' core curriculum. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that cardiopulmonary resuscitation can be performed while wearing PPE without impacting quality, whereas other tasks requiring higher dexterity can be significantly impaired by PPE.Trial Registration Number: NCT04367454, April 29, 2020 (retrospectively registered).","Mormando, Giulia; Paganini, Matteo; Alexopoulos, Chiara; Savino, Sandro; Bortoli, Nicola; Pomiato, Daniele; Graziano, Alessandro; Navalesi, Paolo; Fabris, Fabrizio",Simul. healthc,277,22

We collected the data of 88 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Further, the patients were divided into a non-severe group and a critical group (including critically ill cases). Univariate analysis showed that the absolute lymphocyte count, albumin level, albumin/globulin ratio, lactate dehydrogenase level, interleukin-6 (IL-6) level, erythrocyte count, globulin level, blood glucose level, and age were significantly correlated with the severity of COVID-19. The multivariate binary logistic regression model revealed that age, absolute lymphocyte count, and IL-6 level were independent risk factors in patients with COVID-19. The receiver operating characteristic curve revealed that the combination of IL-6 level, absolute lymphocyte count, and age is superior to a single factor as predictors for severe COVID-19, regardless of whether it is in terms of the area under the curve or the prediction sensitivity and specificity. Early application is beneficial to early identification of critically ill patients and timing individual treatments to reduce mortality.","Liu, Xiaohui; Shi, Si; Xiao, Jinling; Wang, Hongwei; Chen, Liyan; Li, Jianing; Han, Kaiyu",Jpn J Infect Dis,277,26

All patients received the biological agent tocilizumab (TCZ), an interleukin (IL)-6 antagonist, as an experimental treatment for COVID-19 before developing PI. COVID-19 and TCZ have been independently linked to PI risk, yet the cause of this relationship is unknown and under speculation. PI is a rare condition, defined as the presence of gas in the intestinal wall, and although its pathogenesis is poorly understood, intestinal ischemia is one of its causative agents. Based on COVID-19's association with vasculopathic and ischemic insults, and IL-6's protective role in intestinal epithelial ischemia-reperfusion injury, an adverse synergistic association of COVID-19 and TCZ can be proposed in the setting of PI.

Using a cross-sectional survey, the current paper aimed to examine self-reported changes in eating patterns and behaviour during the lockdown in the UK, and associations with BMI, demographic variables, eating styles, health anxiety, food insecurity and coping strategies. Participants (N = 620) were recruited online through social media advertising. The results showed that there were self-reported changes to food consumption during the lockdown across the sample. Increases in consumption of HED (high energy density) snack foods during the lockdown was associated with sex, pre-lockdown eating behaviour (emotional eating and uncontrolled eating), and Covid-specific health anxiety. Increases in positive eating practices such as eating more home prepared foods, and fruits and vegetables, were associated with adaptive coping strategies. Higher emotional eating (EE) during the lockdown was associated with a higher BMI, higher pre-lockdown EE and maladaptive coping strategies. Maladaptive coping strategies moderated the relationship between BMI and EE during the lockdown. In particular a higher BMI was associated with higher EE during the lockdown if an individual also had higher maladaptive coping strategies. These findings suggest that changes to eating behaviour may be part of a wider style of maladaptive or adaptive coping, particularly in those with a history of EE or uncontrolled eating. Preparing individuals to adopt more adaptive coping strategies during lockdown situations may be crucial to improving health during subsequent the lockdown events.","Coulthard, Helen; Sharps, Maxine; Cunliffe, Louise; van den Tol, Annemieke",Appetite,277,20

We aimed to identify the prevalence, etiologies, and mortality rates associated with TME in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-positive patients. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, multicenter, observational cohort study among patients with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection hospitalized at four New York City hospitals in the same health network between March 1, 2020, and May 20, 2020. TME was diagnosed in patients with altered mental status off sedation or after an adequate sedation washout. Patients with structural brain disease, seizures, or primary neurological diagnoses were excluded. The coprimary outcomes were the prevalence of TME stratified by etiology and in-hospital mortality (excluding comfort care only patients) assessed by using a multivariable time-dependent Cox proportional hazards models with adjustment for age, race, sex, intubation, intensive care unit requirement, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores, hospital location, and date of admission. RESULTS: Among 4491 patients with COVID-19, 559 (12%) were diagnosed with TME, of whom 435 of 559 (78%) developed encephalopathy immediately prior to hospital admission. The most common etiologies were septic encephalopathy (n = 247 of 559 [62%]), hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) (n = 331 of 559 [59%]), and uremia (n = 156 of 559 [28%]). Multiple etiologies were present in 435 (78%) patients. Compared with those without TME (n = 3932), patients with TME were older (76 vs. 62 years), had dementia (27% vs. 3%) or psychiatric history (20% vs. 10%), were more often intubated (37% vs. 20%), had a longer hospital length of stay (7.9 vs. 6.0 days), and were less often discharged home (25% vs. 66% [all P < 0.001]). Excluding comfort care patients (n = 267 of 4491 [6%]) and after adjustment for confounders, TME remained associated with increased risk of in-hospital death (n = 128 of 425 [30%] patients with TME died, compared with n = 600 of 3799 [16%] patients without TME; adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.52, P = 0.031), and TME due to hypoxemia conferred the highest risk (n = 97 of 233 [42%] patients with HIE died, compared with n = 631 of 3991 [16%] patients without HIE; aHR 1.56, 95% CI 1.21-2.00, P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: TME occurred in one in eight hospitalized patients with COVID-19, was typically multifactorial, and was most often due to hypoxemia, sepsis, and uremia. After we adjustment for confounding factors, TME was associated with a 24% increased risk of in-hospital mortality.","Frontera, Jennifer A; Melmed, Kara; Fang, Taolin; Granger, Andre; Lin, Jessica; Yaghi, Shadi; Zhou, Ting; Lewis, Ariane; Kurz, Sebastian; Kahn, D Ethan; de Havenon, Adam; Huang, Joshua; Czeisler, Barry M; Lord, Aaron; Meropol, Sharon B; Troxel, Andrea B; Wisniewski, Thomas; Balcer, Laura; Galetta, Steven",Neurocritical care,277,24

Therefore, the discovery of novel antiviral compounds is needed; in this context, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) like temporins hold great promise. Here, we discovered that the harmless temporin G (TG) significantly inhibited the early life-cycle phases of influenza virus. The in vitro hemagglutinating test revealed the existence of TG interaction with the viral hemagglutinin (HA) protein. Furthermore, the hemolysis inhibition assay and the molecular docking studies confirmed a TG/HA complex formation at the level of the conserved hydrophobic stem groove of HA. Remarkably, these findings highlight the ability of TG to block the conformational rearrangements of HA2 subunit, which are essential for the viral envelope fusion with intracellular endocytic vesicles, thereby neutralizing the virus entry into the host cell. In comparison, in the case of parainfluenza virus, which penetrates host cells upon a membrane-fusion process, addition of TG to infected cells provoked ~1.2 log reduction of viral titer released in the supernatant. Nevertheless, at the same condition, an immunofluorescent assay showed that the expression of viral hemagglutinin/neuraminidase protein was not significantly reduced. This suggested a peptide-mediated block of some late steps of viral replication and therefore the impairment of the extracellular release of viral particles. Overall, our results are the first demonstration of the ability of an AMP to interfere with the replication of respiratory viruses with a different mechanism of cell entry and will open a new avenue for the development of novel therapeutic approaches against a large variety of respiratory viruses, including the recent SARS-CoV2.","De Angelis, M; Casciaro, B; Genovese, A; Brancaccio, D; Marcocci, M E; Novellino, E; Carotenuto, A; Palamara, A T; Mangoni, M L; Nencioni, L",FASEB J,277,16

We compared inflammatory markers pre and post treatment including D-dimer and ferritin. RESULTS: We identified a total of 17 patients who received IV vitamin C for COVID-19. The inpatient mortality rate in this series was 12% with 17.6% rates of intubation and mechanical ventilation. We noted a significant decrease in inflammatory markers, including ferritin and D-dimer, and a trend to decreasing FiO2 requirements, after vitamin C administration. CONCLUSION: The use of IV vitamin C in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 disease may be feasible.","Hiedra, Raul; Lo, Kevin Bryan; Elbashabsheh, Mohammad; Gul, Fahad; Wright, Robert Matthew; Albano, Jeri; Azmaiparashvili, Zurab; Patarroyo Aponte, Gabriel",Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther,277,24

As the most reliable epidemic diagnosis, we propose the PCR test positive rate. Examining the COVID-19 epidemic in Tokyo shows that the positive rate follows the epidemic accurately, without being affected by medical institution closures or the psychology of people. By comparing with the change of the positive rate, we argue that the psychology of people was the cause of the observed asymmetry and shallow valleys in the number of confirmed cases. We discuss that the positive rate as large as 1-5% in the valleys of the epidemic implies that many people are already infected and immune. The observed fact that the positive rate followed the number of positives accurately and the value lower than those reported in the test-negative design studies of influenza are attributable to the governments policy of finding as many patients as possible. We mention three possibilities as the causes of the repeated COVID-19 epidemic in Japan.","Tomie, Toshihisa",,277,16

We take the position that marketing managers' distinctive functional influence on radical change is in driving product and service innovations that are new-to-the-firm We then argue that crisis situations present an opportunity for top and middle managers to rethink assumptions about ‘who does what’ in radical change initiatives from the marketing function, focusing on the underemphasized possibility of MMMs initiating change and CMOs implementing Building on recent findings on ‘change role reversal’, we unpack the notion that change initiatives may be most effective when middle managers initiate, while top managers implement This unconventional change route would see CMOs taking a deliberate and supportive back seat in navigating crisis, while MMMs take the wheel in driving radical change initiatives We identify duties and hurdles to a change role reversal— approach faced by MMMs throughout three stages of innovation-enabled radical change proposed by Burgelman (1991;variation-selection-retention) and chart corresponding roles that CMOs can play to support MMMs: advisor, judge, and guardian Three tangible final questions addressed to CMOs guide managerial applications, while considerations outside scope are also discussed © 2020 Elsevier Inc","Heyden, M.

They recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) using membrane-bound receptors, as well as cytosolic receptors such as inflammasomes. Inflammasomes activate inflammatory caspases, which in turn process and release the inflammatory cytokines IL-1ß and IL-18. Additionally, inflammasomes trigger a form of lytic cell death termed pyroptosis. One of the most important inflammasomes at the host-pathogen interface is the non-canonical caspase-11 inflammasome that responds to LPS in the cytosol. Caspase-11 is important in defense against Gram-negative pathogens, and can drive inflammatory diseases such as LPS-induced sepsis. However, pathogens can employ evasive strategies to minimize or evade host caspase-11 detection. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of the function of the non-canonical caspase-11 inflammasome in sensing of cytosolic LPS, and its mechanism of action with particular emphasis in the role of caspase-11 in the lung. We also explore some of the strategies pathogens use to evade caspase-11.","Oh, Changhoon; Verma, Ambika; Aachoui, Youssef",Front Immunol,277,20

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there have been more than 100 million confirmed cases of COVID-19, including more than 2.4 million deaths. It is extremely important the early detection of the disease, and the use of medical imaging such as chest X-ray (CXR) and chest Computed Tomography (CCT) have proved to be an excellent solution. However, this process requires clinicians to do it within a manual and time-consuming task, which is not ideal when trying to speed up the diagnosis. In this work, we propose an ensemble classifier based on probabilistic Support Vector Machine (SVM) in order to identify pneumonia patterns while providing information about the reliability of the classification. Specifically, each CCT scan is divided into cubic patches and features contained in each one of them are extracted by applying kernel PCA. The use of base classifiers within an ensemble allows our system to identify the pneumonia patterns regardless of their size or location. Decisions of each individual patch are then combined into a global one according to the reliability of each individual classification: the lower the uncertainty, the higher the contribution. Performance is evaluated in a real scenario, yielding an accuracy of 97.86%. The large performance obtained and the simplicity of the system (use of deep learning in CCT images would result in a huge computational cost) evidence the applicability of our proposal in a real-world environment.","Arco, Juan E.; Ortiz, Andr'es; Ram'irez, Javier; Mart'inez-Murcia, Francisco J.; Zhang, Yu-Dong; Broncano, Jordi; Berb'is, M.

Under these unique circumstances, urologists continue to provide essential healthcare services and support healthcare systems, by participating in the treatment of COVID-19(+) patients and sparing vital equipment and hospital beds. However, delivering medical care during the pandemic requires strategic planning for all surgical and outpatient activities. Proposed measures include rescheduling elective non-oncological surgeries and using a prioritization protocol for oncological surgeries according to hospital capacity. Following that, outpatient clinics could be partly replaced by telemedicine. Additionally, urologists should be trained in screening and treating patients with COVID-19 during their daily routine. In order to efficiently provide their services, a management protocol for suspected or known COVID-19 urological patients should be implemented. Furthermore, preventive measures for the nosocomial dispersion of the virus and training on self-protective equipment is mandatory for all physicians. Finally, organizational planning for the best utilization of the staff is of utmost importance.

In recent years an increasing number of infections and human-to-human transmission is creating a distressing situation. In this short communication, we have focused on the biology, pathogenesis, immunology, epidemiology and future perspective of the Hantaviruses. Our understandings of hantavirus related pandemics and syndrome are limited, the contributing environmental factors, the cellular and viral dynamics in transmission from natural reservoirs to humans and finally, the virology in humans is quite intricate. Priorities for future research suggest that setting up scientific collaboration, the funding, and encouragement of health ministries and the research institutes should take admirable steps to build an understanding of this virus. Discovering new drugs or other therapeutic molecules such as vaccines takes a longer time. Thus with the recent artificial intelligence (AI) technology, the rifle for impending new medicines should be hastened.

METHODS: This is a single center, retrospective, observational study. All consecutive patients admitted with primary diagnosis of ischemic/ hemorrhagic stroke between March1st -May10th 2020 were included and compared with the same time period in 2019. RESULTS: There was a 41.9% increase in stroke admissions in 2020 (148 vs 210,P = .001). When comparing all ischemic strokes, higher rate of large vessel occlusion (LVO) (18.3% vs 33.8%,P = .008) and significant delay in initiation of mechanical thrombectomy after hospital arrival (67.75 vs 104.30 minutes,P = .001) was observed in 2020. When comparing all hemorrhagic strokes, there were no differences between the two years. Among 591 COVID-19 admissions, 31 (5.24%) patients with stroke including 19 with ischemic (3.21%) and 12 with hemorrhagic stroke (2.03%) were identified. Patients with COVID-19 and ischemic stroke were significantly younger (58.74 vs 48.11 years,P = .002), predominantly male (68.18% vs 94.74%,P = .016), had lesser vascular risk factors, had more severe clinical presentation (NIHSS 7.01 vs 17.05,P < .001), and higher rate of LVO (23.6% vs. 63.1%,P = .006). There was no difference in the rate of endovascular thrombectomy, but time to groin puncture was significantly longer in COVID-19 patients (83.41 vs 129.50 minutes,P = .003). For hemorrhagic stroke, COVID-19 patients did not differ from non-COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Stroke continues to occur during this pandemic and stroke pathways have been affected by the pandemic. Stroke occurs in approximately 5% of patients with COVID-19. COVID-19 associated ischemic stroke occurs in predominantly male patients who are younger, with fewer vascular risk factors, can be more severe, and have higher rates of LVO.

Each country was affected but with a varying number of infected cases and mortality rates. Africa was hit late by the pandemic but the number of cases rose sharply. In this study, we investigated 224 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) in the early part of the outbreak, of which 69 were from Africa. We analyzed a total of 550 mutations by comparing them with the reference SARS-CoV-2 sequence from Wuhan. We classified the mutations observed based on country and region, and afterwards analyzed common and unique mutations on the African continent as a whole. Correlation analyses showed that the duo variants ORF1ab/RdRp 4715L and S protein 614G variants, which are strongly linked to fatality rate, were not significantly and positively correlated with fatality rates (r = -0.03757, P = 0.5331 and r = -0.2876, P = 0.6389, respectively), although increased number of cases correlated with number of deaths (r = 0.997, P = 0.0002). Furthermore, most cases in Africa were mainly imported from American and European countries, except one isolate with no mutation and was similar to the original isolate from Wuhan. Moreover, unique mutations specific to countries were identified in the early phase of the outbreak but these mutations were not regional-specific. There were common mutations in all isolates across the continent as well as similar isolate-specific mutations in different regions. Our findings suggest that mutation is rapid in SARS-CoV-2 in Africa and although these mutations spread across the continent, the duo variants could not possibly be the sole cause of COVID-19 deaths in Africa in the early phase of the outbreak.","Lamptey, Jones; Oyelami, Favour Oluwapelumi; Owusu, Michael; Nkrumah, Bernard; Idowu, Paul Oluwagbenga; Adu-Gyamfi, Enoch Appiah; Czika, Armin; El-Duah, Philip; Yeboah, Richmond; Sylverken, Augustina; Olasunkanmi, Oluwatayo Israel; Owusu-Dabo, Ellis; Drosten, Christian; Adu-Sarkodie, Yaw",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,277,11

Such loss could be prevented if there were a serologic assay for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies for serological surveillance of its infection at the early stage of disease. METHODS: Using Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) cell-expressed full-length SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein as capturing antigen, a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)/SARS-CoV-2 S1 serology enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit was developed and validated with negative samples collected prior to the outbreak or during the outbreak and positive samples from patients confirmed with COVID-19. RESULTS: The specificity of the ELISA kit was 97.5%, as examined against total 412 normal human samples. The sensitivity was 97.1% by testing against 69 samples from hospitalized and/or recovered COVID-19 patients. The overall accuracy rate reached 97.3%. The assay was able to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibody on day 1 after the onset of COVID-19 disease. The average antibody levels increased during hospitalization and 14 days after discharge. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected in 28 of 276 asymptomatic medical staff and 1 of 5 nucleic acid test-negative ""close contacts"" of COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: With the assays developed here, we can screen medical staff, incoming patients, passengers, and people who are in close contact with the confirmed patients to identify the ""innocent viral spreaders,"" protect the medical staff, and stop further spread of the virus.","Rongqing, Zhao; Li, Maohua; Song, Hao; Chen, Jianxin; Ren, Wenlin; Feng, Yingmei; Gao, George F; Song, Jinwen; Peng, Ya; Su, Bin; Guo, Xianghua; Wang, Yanjun; Chen, Jingong; Li, Jianli; Sun, Hunter; Bai, Zhonghu; Cao, Wenjing; Zhu, Jin; Zhang, Qinlu; Sun, Yufei; Sun, Sean; Mao, Xinkun; Su, Junchi; Chen, Xiang; He, Ailiang; Gao, Wen; Jin, Ronghua; Jiang, Yongzhong; Sun, Le",Clin Infect Dis,277,20

In patients and neonates who are showing symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019, real-time polymerase chain reaction of nasal and throat swabs, sputum, and feces is performed to detect the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. In addition, real-time polymerase chain reaction of vaginal swabs, amniotic fluid, placenta, cord blood, neonatal blood, or breast milk for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 did not show substantial results. Viremia was present in 1% of adult patients who were showing symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019. Here, we reviewed 12 articles published between Feb. 10, 2020, and April 4, 2020, that reported on 68 deliveries and 71 neonates with maternal infection in the third trimester of pregnancy. To determine whether infection occurred congenitally or perinatally, perinatal exposure, mode of delivery, and time interval from delivery to the diagnosis of neonatal infection were considered. Neonates with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection are usually asymptomatic. In 4 cases, a diagnostic test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection was performed within 48 hours of life. Furthermore, detection rates of real-time polymerase chain reaction and the interpretation of immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G antibodies levels in cord and neonatal blood were discussed in relation with the immaturity of the fetal and neonatal immune system.","Lamouroux, Audrey; Attie-Bitach, Tania; Martinovic, Jelena; Leruez-Ville, Marianne; Ville, Yves",Am J Obstet Gynecol,277,14

DESIGN: We examined the reliability and internal validity of the ELCSA scale in three repeated waves of cross-sectional surveys with Rasch models. We estimated the monthly prevalence of food insecurity in the general population and in households with and without children and compared them with a national 2018 survey. We tested concurrent validity by testing associations of food insecurity with socio-economic status and anxiety. SETTING: ENCOVID-19 is a monthly telephone cross-sectional survey collecting information on the well-being of Mexican households during the pandemic lockdown. Surveys used probabilistic samples, and we used data from April (n 833), May (n 850) and June 2020 (n 1674). PARTICIPANTS: Mexicans 18 years or older who had a mobile telephone. RESULTS: ELCSA had an adequate model fit and food insecurity was associated, within each wave, with more poverty and anxiety. The COVID-19 lockdown was associated with an important reduction in food security, decreasing stepwise from 38·9 % in 2018 to 24·9 % in June 2020 in households with children. CONCLUSIONS: Telephone surveys were a feasible strategy to monitor reductions in food security during the COVID-19 lockdown.","Gaitán-Rossi, Pablo; Vilar-Compte, Mireya; Teruel, Graciela; Pérez-Escamilla, Rafael",Public Health Nutr,277,5

This task is challenging to achieve without the inclusion of a strong and safe mucosal adjuvant. Previously, inulin acetate (InAc), a plant-based polymer, is shown to activate toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) and elicit a robust systemic immune response as a vaccine adjuvant. This study investigates the potential of nanoparticles prepared with InAc (InAc-NPs) as an intranasal vaccine delivery system to generate both mucosal and systemic immune responses. InAc-NPs (â¼250 nm in diameter) activated wild-type (WT) macrophages but failed to activate macrophages from TLR4 knockout mice or WT macrophages when pretreated with a TLR4 antagonist (lipopolysaccharide-RS (LPS-RS)), which indicates the selective nature of a InAc-based nanodelivery system as a TLR4 agonist. Intranasal immunization using antigen-loaded InAc-NPs generated â¼65-fold and 19-fold higher serum IgG1 and IgG2a titers against the antigen, respectively, as compared to PLGA-NPs as a delivery system. InAc-NPs have also stimulated the secretion of sIgA at various mucosal sites, including nasal-associated lymphoid tissues (NALTs), lungs, and intestine, and produced a strong memory response indicative of both humoral and cellular immune activation. Overall, by stimulating both systemic and mucosal immunity, InAc-NPs laid a basis for a potential intranasal delivery system for mucosal vaccination.","Bakkari, Mohammed Ali; Valiveti, Chaitanya K; Kaushik, Radhey S; Tummala, Hemachand",Mol Pharm,277,20

Quantification of IgA and IgG antibodies in saliva allows studies of the mucosal and systemic immune response after natural infection or vaccination. We developed and validated an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) to detect and quantify salivary IgA and IgG antibodies against the prefusion-stabilized form of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Normalization against total antibody isotype was performed to account for specimen differences, such as collection time and sample volume. Saliva samples collected from 187 SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases enrolled in 2 cohorts and 373 pre-pandemic saliva samples were tested. The sensitivity of both EIAs was high (IgA: 95.5%; IgG: 89.7%) without compromising specificity (IgA: 99%; IgG: 97%). No cross reactivity with seasonal coronaviruses was observed. The limit of detection for SARS-CoV-2 salivary IgA and IgG assays were 1.98 ng/mL and 0.30 ng/mL, respectively. Salivary IgA and IgG antibodies were detected earlier in patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms than in severe cases. However, severe cases showed higher salivary antibody titers than those with a mild infection. Salivary IgA titers quickly decreased after 6 weeks in mild cases but remained detectable until at least week 10 in severe cases. Salivary IgG titers remained high for all patients, regardless of disease severity. In conclusion, EIAs for both IgA and IgG had high specificity and sensitivity for the confirmation of current or recent SARS-CoV-2 infections and evaluation of the IgA and IgG immune response.","Costantini, Veronica; Nguyen, Kenny; Lyski, Zoe; Novosad, Shannon; Bardossy, Ana C; Lyons, Amanda K; Gable, Paige; Kutty, Preeta K; Lutgring, Joseph D; Brunton, Amanda; Thornburg, Natalie J.; Brown, Allison C; McDonald, L.

METHODS: We analysed data of COVID-19 patients treated in nine hospitals in the Netherlands. Inclusion dates ranged from 27 February to 15 May 2020, when the Dutch national guidelines no longer supported the use of (hydroxy)chloroquine. Seven hospitals routinely treated patients with (hydroxy)chloroquine, two hospitals did not. Primary outcome was 21-day all-cause mortality. We performed a survival analysis using log-rank test and Cox regression with adjustment for age, sex and covariates based on premorbid health, disease severity and the use of steroids for adult respiratory distress syndrome, including dexamethasone. RESULTS: Among 1949 individuals, 21-day mortality was 21.5% in 1596 patients treated in hospitals that routinely prescribed (hydroxy)chloroquine, and 15.0% in 353 patients treated in hospitals that did not. In the adjusted Cox regression models this difference disappeared, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.09 (95% CI 0.81-1.47). When stratified by treatment actually received in individual patients, the use of (hydroxy)chloroquine was associated with an increased 21-day mortality (HR 1.58; 95% CI 1.24-2.02) in the full model. CONCLUSIONS: After adjustment for confounders, mortality was not significantly different in hospitals that routinely treated patients with (hydroxy)chloroquine compared with hospitals that did not. We compared outcomes of hospital strategies rather than outcomes of individual patients to reduce the chance of indication bias.

METHODS: In this study a retrospective cohort of 264 COVID-19 cases admitted at Macarena University was used for development and internal validation of a risk score to predict the occurrence of critical illness in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Backward stepwise logistic regression was used to derive the model, including clinical and laboratory variables predictive of critical illness. Internal validation of the final model used bootstrapped samples and the model scoring derived from the coefficients. External validation was performed in a cohort of 154 cases admitted at Valme and Virgen del Rocio University Hospital. RESULTS: A total of 62 (23.5%) patients developed a critical illness during their hospitalization stay, 21 (8.0%) patients needed invasive ventilation, 34 (12.9%) were admitted at the ICU and the overall mortality was of 14.8% (39 cases). 5 variables were included in the final model: age >59.5 years (OR: 3.11;95%CI 1.39-6.97), abnormal CRP results (OR: 5.76;95%CI 2.32-14.30), abnormal lymphocytes count (OR: 3.252;95%CI 1.56-6.77), abnormal CK results (OR: 3.38;95%CI 1.59-7.20) and abnormal creatinine (OR: 3.30;95%CI 1.42-7.68).

Methods: This is a single-center, hospital-based observational study that included autopsied testicular and epididymal specimens of deceased COVID-19 male patients (n=6) and recruited recovering COVID-19 inpatients (n=23) with an equal number of age-matched controls, respectively. We performed histopathological examinations on testicular and epididymal specimens, and also performed TUNEL assay and immunohistochemistry. Whereas, we investigated the semen specimen for sperm parameters and immune factors. Findings: Autopsied testicular and epididymal specimens of COVID-19 showed the presence of interstitial edema, congestion, red blood cell exudation in testes, and epididymides. Thinning of seminiferous tubules was observed. The number of apoptotic cells within seminiferous tubules was significantly higher in COVID-19 compared to control cases. It also showed an increased concentration of CD3+ and CD68+ in the interstitial cells of testicular tissue and the presence of IgG within seminiferous tubules. Semen from COVID-19 inpatients showed that 39.1% (n=9) of them have oligozoospermia, and 60.9% (n=14) showed a significant increase in leucocytes in semen. Decreased sperm concentration, and increased seminal levels of IL-6, TNF-&#945;, and MCP-1 compared to control males were observed. Interpretation: Impairment of spermatogenesis was observed in COVID-19 patients, which could be partially explained as a result of an elevated immune response in testis. Additionally, autoimmune orchitis occurred in some COVID-19 patients. Further research on the reversibility of impairment and developing treatment are warranted.

We used a nonhuman primate model (the macaque), that recapitulates mild COVID-19 symptoms, to analyze the effects of a SARS-CoV-2 infection on dynamic changes of the gut microbiota. 16S rRNA gene profiling and analysis of ß diversity indicated significant changes in the composition of the gut microbiota with a peak at 10-13 days post-infection (dpi). Analysis of bacterial abundance correlation networks confirmed disruption of the bacterial community at 10-13 dpi. Some alterations in microbiota persisted after the resolution of the infection until day 26. Some changes in the relative bacterial taxon abundance associated with infectious parameters. Interestingly, the relative abundance of Acinetobacter (Proteobacteria) and some genera of the Ruminococcaceae family (Firmicutes) was positively correlated with the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the upper respiratory tract. Targeted quantitative metabolomics indicated a drop in short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and changes in several bile acids and tryptophan metabolites in infected animals. The relative abundance of several taxa known to be SCFA producers (mostly from the Ruminococcaceae family) was negatively correlated with systemic inflammatory markers while the opposite correlation was seen with several members of the genus Streptococcus. Collectively, SARS-CoV-2 infection in a nonhuman primate is associated with changes in the gut microbiota's composition and functional activity.","Sokol, Harry; Contreras, Vanessa; Maisonnasse, Pauline; Desmons, Aurore; Delache, Benoit; Sencio, Valentin; Machelart, Arnaud; Brisebarre, Angela; Humbert, Lydie; Deryuter, Lucie; Gauliard, Emilie; Heumel, Severine; Rainteau, Dominique; Dereuddre-Bosquet, Nathalie; Menu, Elisabeth; Ho Tsong Fang, Raphael; Lamaziere, Antonin; Brot, Loic; Wahl, Celine; Oeuvray, Cyriane; Rolhion, Nathalie; Van Der Werf, Sylvie; Ferreira, Stéphanie; Le Grand, Roger; Trottein, François",Gut Microbes,277,1

We collected clinical data of 155 test-positive COVID-19 pregnant women at Stony Brook University Hospital. Many of these collected data are of multivariate categorical type, where the number of possible outcomes grows exponentially as the dimension of data increases. We modeled the data within the unsupervised Bayesian framework and mapped them into a lower-dimensional space using latent Gaussian processes. The latent features in the lower dimensional space were further used for predicting if a pregnant woman would be admitted to a hospital due to COVID-19 or would remain with mild symptoms. We compared the prediction accuracy with the dummy/one-hot encoding of categorical data and found that the latent Gaussian process had better accuracy.","Ajirak, Marzieh; Heiselman, Cassandra; Fuchs, Anna; Heiligenstein, Mia; Herrera, Kimberly; Garretto, Diana; Djuric, Petar",,277,1

Many cancer departments globally have brought in changes to their daily practice. This article is about our experience of evolving ""COVID 19 PROTOCOL"" devised in our department and taking a shape to suit a health care system with limited budget. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All the patient census & details of department of surgical oncology, Royapettah cancer hospital, from month of March 2020 to July 2020, who were subjected to COVID protocol were compared to patient census of similar duration in immediate past five months of October 2019 to February 2020. The data from out-patient department, ward in-patient census and healthcare personnel data was analyzed. RESULTS: There was a drop to 63.5% in OP census and 61.6% in IP census. There was a drop to 64.5% in number of major cases operated during initial phases of COVID pandemic. Health care workers were also infected with the COVID but cross infectivity can be checked if proper steps to adhere to an institutional protocol based on general measures of cleanliness are taken. CONCLUSION: Adherence to an institutional protocol based on compliance to general measures of masking, hand washing and social distancing plays a major role in minimizing disease spread. The Royapettah COVID protocol, though in process of evolution, can be recommended for any health care center with limited resources.","Subbiah, Shanmugam; Hussain, Syed Afroze; Samanth Kumar, M",Eur. j. surg. oncol,277,16

Here, we describe a comprehensive transcriptome profile of lncRNA in PDCoV-infected swine testicular (ST) cells. In total, 1,308 annotated and 1,190 novel lncRNA candidate sequences were identified. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis revealed that these lncRNAs might be involved in numerous biological processes. Clustering analysis of differentially expressed lncRNAs showed that 454 annotated and 376 novel lncRNAs were regulated after PDCoV infection. Furthermore, we constructed a lncRNA-protein-coding gene co-expression interaction network. The KEGG analysis of the co-expressed genes showed that these differentially expressed lncRNAs were enriched in pathways related to metabolism and TNF signaling. Our study provided comprehensive information about lncRNAs that would be a useful resource for studying the pathogenesis of and designing antiviral therapy for PDCoV infection.","Liu, Junli; Wang, Fangfang; Du, Liuyang; Li, Juan; Yu, Tianqi; Jin, Yulan; Yan, Yan; Zhou, Jiyong; Gu, Jinyan",Front.

Understanding the immune cell states shared between COVID-19 and other inflammatory diseases with established therapies may help nominate immunomodulatory therapies. METHODS: To identify cellular phenotypes that may be shared across tissues affected by disparate inflammatory diseases, we developed a meta-analysis and integration pipeline that models and removes the effects of technology, tissue of origin, and donor that confound cell-type identification. Using this approach, we integrated > 300,000 single-cell transcriptomic profiles from COVID-19-affected lungs and tissues from healthy subjects and patients with five inflammatory diseases: rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and interstitial lung disease. We tested the association of shared immune states with severe/inflamed status compared to healthy control using mixed-effects modeling. To define environmental factors within these tissues that shape shared macrophage phenotypes, we stimulated human blood-derived macrophages with defined combinations of inflammatory factors, emphasizing in particular antiviral interferons IFN-beta (IFN-ß) and IFN-gamma (IFN-Î³), and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF. RESULTS: We built an immune cell reference consisting of > 300,000 single-cell profiles from 125 healthy or disease-affected donors from COVID-19 and five inflammatory diseases. We observed a CXCL10+ CCL2+ inflammatory macrophage state that is shared and strikingly abundant in severe COVID-19 bronchoalveolar lavage samples, inflamed RA synovium, inflamed CD ileum, and UC colon. These cells exhibited a distinct arrangement of pro-inflammatory and interferon response genes, including elevated levels of CXCL10, CXCL9, CCL2, CCL3, GBP1, STAT1, and IL1B. Further, we found this macrophage phenotype is induced upon co-stimulation by IFN-Î³ and TNF-&#945;. CONCLUSIONS: Our integrative analysis identified immune cell states shared across inflamed tissues affected by inflammatory diseases and COVID-19. Our study supports a key role for IFN-Î³ together with TNF-&#945; in driving an abundant inflammatory macrophage phenotype in severe COVID-19-affected lungs, as well as inflamed RA synovium, CD ileum, and UC colon, which may be targeted by existing immunomodulatory therapies.","Zhang, Fan; Mears, Joseph R; Shakib, Lorien; Beynor, Jessica I; Shanaj, Sara; Korsunsky, Ilya; Nathan, Aparna; Donlin, Laura T; Raychaudhuri, Soumya",Genome Med,277,1

Objective: To describe the feasibility, clinical and process outcomes associated with a multidisciplinary telemedicine surveillance model to triage and manage obstetric patients with known exposures and/or symptoms concerning for COVID-19. Study Design: We implemented a multidisciplinary telemedicine surveillance model with obstetric physicians and nurses to standardize ambulatory care for obstetric patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 based on symptoms or exposures at an urban academic tertiary care center with multiple hospital and community-based affiliated practices. All pregnant or postpartum patients with COVID-19 symptoms, exposures or hospitalization were eligible for inclusion in the program. Patients were assessed via regular nursing phone calls and were managed according to illness severity. Patient characteristics, clinical and process outcomes were abstracted from the electronic medical record. Results: A total of 135 patients were enrolled in the multidisciplinary telemedicine model from March 17-April 19, 2020, of whom 130 were pregnant and 5 recently postpartum. The majority (N=116, 86%) were managed solely in the outpatient setting and did not require in-person evaluation; 9 were ultimately admitted after ambulatory or urgent evaluation and 10 patients were followed after hospital discharge. Although only 50% of the patients were tested secondary to limitations in ambulatory testing, 1 in 3 of those was PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2 (N=22, 16% of entire cohort). Patients were enrolled in the telemedicine model for a median of 7 days (IQR 4-8) and averaged one phone call daily, resulting in 891 nursing calls and 20 physician calls over 1 month. Conclusion: A multidisciplinary telemedicine surveillance model for outpatient management of obstetric patients with COVID-19 symptoms and/or exposures is feasible and resulted in rates of ambulatory management similar to those seen in non-pregnant patients. A centralized model for telemedicine surveillance of obstetric patients with COVID-19 symptoms may preserve inpatient resources and prevent avoidable staff and patient exposures, particularly in centers with multiple ambulatory practice settings.","Reforma, Liberty G; Duffy, Cassandra; Collier, Ai-Ris Y; Wylie, Blair J; Shainker, Scott A; Golen, Toni H; Herlihy, Mary; Lydeard, Aisling; Zera, Chloe A",Am J Obstet Gynecol MFM,277,26

In light of the pandemic linked to Covid-19, although there is no clear scientific evidence in the literature, it is necessary to identify protections with regard to clothing, operating protocols, disinfection of environments and management of waiting rooms and front offices. This paper is a basis for operative indications for dentists and other health care professionals in phase 2 post lock-down for both private and public structures.","Enrico, Gherlone; Elisabetta, Polizzi; Giulia, Tetè; Paolo, Capparè",New microbiol,277,20

The Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) was recently developed to assess the fear of COVID-19. Although many studies found that the FCV-19S is psychometrically sound, it is unclear whether the FCV-19S is invariant across countries. The present study aimed to examine the measurement invariance of the FCV-19S across eleven countries. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: Using data collected from prior research on Bangladesh (N = 8,550), United Kingdom (N = 344), Brazil (N = 1,843), Taiwan (N = 539), Italy (N = 249), New Zealand (N = 317), Iran (N = 717), Cuba (N = 772), Pakistan (N = 937), Japan (N = 1,079) and France (N = 316), comprising a total 15,663 participants, the present study used the multigroup confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and Rasch differential item functioning (DIF) to examine the measurement invariance of the FCV-19S across country, gender and age (children aged below 18 years, young to middle-aged adults aged between 18 and 60 years, and older people aged above 60 years). RESULTS: The unidimensional structure of the FCV-19S was confirmed. Multigroup CFA showed that FCV-19S was partially invariant across country and fully invariant across gender and age. DIF findings were consistent with the findings from multigroup CFA. Many DIF items were displayed for country, few DIF items were displayed for age, and no DIF items were displayed for gender. CONCLUSION: Based on the results of the present study, the FCV-19S is a good psychometric instrument to assess fear of COVID-19 during the pandemic period. Moreover, the use of FCV-19S is supported in at least ten countries with satisfactory psychometric properties.","Lin, Chung-Ying; Hou, Wen-Li; Mamun, Mohammed A; Aparecido da Silva, José; Broche-Pérez, Yunier; Ullah, Irfan; Masuyama, Akihiro; Wakashima, Koubun; Mailliez, Mélody; Carre, Arnaud; Chen, Yu-Pin; Chang, Kun-Chia; Kuo, Yi-Jie; Soraci, Paolo; Scarf, Damian; Broström, Anders; Griffiths, Mark D; Pakpour, Amir H",,277,16

We describe a patient with early-onset multi-organ immune dysregulation resulting from a mosaic, gain-of-function mutation (S703I) in JAK1, encoding a kinase essential for signaling downstream of >25 cytokines. By custom single-cell RNA sequencing, we examine mosaicism with single-cell resolution. We find that JAK1 transcription was predominantly restricted to a single allele across different cells, introducing the concept of a mutational ""transcriptotype"" that differs from the genotype. Functionally, the mutation increases JAK1 activity and transactivates partnering JAKs, independent of its catalytic domain. S703I JAK1 is not only hypermorphic for cytokine signaling but also neomorphic, as it enables signaling cascades not canonically mediated by JAK1. Given these results, the patient was treated with tofacitinib, a JAK inhibitor, leading to the rapid resolution of clinical disease. These findings offer a platform for personalized medicine with the concurrent discovery of fundamental biological principles.","Gruber, Conor N; Calis, Jorg J A; Buta, Sofija; Evrony, Gilad; Martin, Jerome C; Uhl, Skyler A; Caron, Rachel; Jarchin, Lauren; Dunkin, David; Phelps, Robert; Webb, Bryn D; Saland, Jeffrey M; Merad, Miriam; Orange, Jordan S; Mace, Emily M; Rosenberg, Brad R; Gelb, Bruce D; Bogunovic, Dusan",Immunity,277,24

This article provides background on and explores ""telepresence"" in healthcare literature. Telepresence strongly impacts the patient experience, but it is poorly defined in current research. The aim was to conceptually define telepresence using qualitative methods. DESIGN: Dimensional analysis was used to analyze telepresence in clinical literature and create a clearer definition of telepresence as a concept. Multiple databases were searched for articles related to telepresence. Thirteen international articles related to telepresence were selected for analysis. METHODS: Dimensional analysis allowed for multiple viewpoints to be explored within each distinct context and perspective. FINDINGS: Twenty-five dimensions were discovered within the articles, which were synthesized to seven core dimensions of telepresence: connection, technological mediation, experienced realism, trust, being supportive, collaboration, and emotional consequence. CONCLUSIONS: Telepresence is highly impactful on the patient's experience of telehealth care visits. The conceptual map produced by this dimensional analysis provides direction for clinicians to improve their ability to be present with patients during telehealth care. Potential implications include a starting point for future qualitative research, and the use of this dimensional analysis to inform clinical guidelines, improve clinician training, and assist in the development of new care models. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: A telepresence definition brings clarity to an ill-defined concept. COVID-19 magnifies the need for a better understanding of telepresence, which allows clinicians to improve telehealth encounters.","Groom, Lisa L; Brody, Abraham A; Squires, Allison P",J. nurs. scholarsh,277,15

We analysed tumours with pl and evaluated the relationship between the PLC status and pl. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 428 surgically treated patients who had been diagnosed with non-small-cell lung cancer with pl and had their PLC status examined between 2000 and 2016. We investigated the influence of a PLC-positive status on the prognosis and searched for the factors predictive of a PLC-positive status. RESULTS: Seventy-eight (18%) patients were PLC positive. The recurrence-free survival of PLC-positive patients was significantly worse than that of PLC-negative patients in pl1 and pl2, but not in pl3 (5-year recurrence-free survival rate, PLC positive versus PLC negative: pl1, 22.0% vs 60.0%, P = 0.002; pl2, 30.4% vs 59.7%, P = 0.015; pl3, 50.0% vs 59.6%, P = 0.427). A multivariable analysis showed that the degree of pl (pl2-3 versus pl1) [odds ratio (OR) 5.34, P < 0.001] was an independent predictive factor for PLC positivity. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation positivity (OR 5.48, P = 0.042) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) &#8805;5 ng/ml (OR 3.78, P = 0.042) were associated with a PLC-positive status in patients with pl2-3. We found that the PLC-positive rate in patients with pl2-3 was 35.6%; however, if the tumour was EGFR mutation positive and had CEA &#8805;5 ng/ml, the PLC-positive rate increased to 77%.

The aim is to keep patient safety as the priority, besides, continuing to provide essential healthcare services. METHODS: Situational audit was performed for the services rendered before and during COVID-19 pandemic and the elevation of the disease alert status, and a retrospective analysis of the attendance and procedures performed in the service. RESULTS: We present a methodology for performing a situational audit and generating service modification for hand and reconstructive microsurgery unit in a pandemic. There was no significant difference between the number of patients seen at outpatient clinics. However, there was a reduction in the numbers of total surgeries performed, with a 40% drop in the number of elective surgeries performed. There was also a reduction of cases seen in the emergency department hand clinic. DISCUSSION: COVID-19 pandemic is currently affecting not only the health service but also, other vital services all over the world. The pandemic puts significant challenges to acute surgical services in a hospital system involved in the management of the pandemic. Surgeons need to take proactive and a systematic approach in managing the available resources while maintaining essential surgical services. This paper provides the tools and methodology for doctors to plan their services in a pandemic situation. CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to maintain essential surgical services in a pandemic situation through rapid situational audits and generating localised strategies while considering the constraints imposed during the pandemics while maintaining patient and staff safety.","Omar, Usama Farghaly; Pei Yein, Tong; Rajaratnam, Vaikunthan",Postgrad Med J,277,20

This indicates that CoVs developed effective mechanisms to overcome the host innate immune response and promote viral replication and pathogenesis.

A meta-analysis was conducted to determine the correlation between these MTTP polymorphisms and NAFLD. Materials and Methods: : A systematic search was carried out using PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library to retrieve English studies that reported the relationship between MTTP polymorphisms (rs1800591 and rs3816873) and NAFLD published before February 18, 2020. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to appraise the risk of MTTP polymorphism in NAFLD. Results: : A total of 10 case-control studies, including 1388 cases and 1690 healthy subjects, were included. No significant correlation between the rs1800591 (G vs. T: OR = 1.08, 95% CI = 0.68-1.70, P = 0.76) and rs3816873 (CT + CC vs. TT: OR = 1.23, 95% CI = 0.76-2.01, P = 0.398) polymorphisms of MTTP and NAFLD was found in any of the models. However, when NASH patients confirmed by liver biopsy were extracted alone for rs1800591 polymorphism analysis, it was found that the G allele significantly increased the risk of NASH under the heterozygote model (GT vs. TT: OR = 3.16, 95% CI = 1.13-8.83, P = 0.028) and dominant model (GT + GG vs. TT: OR = 3.03, 95% CI = 1.13-8.09, P = 0.027). Conclusion: The present meta-analysis revealed that the rs1800591 and rs3816873 polymorphisms of the MTTP gene are uncommon in NAFLD.

Such a policy’s success is crucial to address the new challenges for planning brought to light by the COVID-19 pandemic. In this sense, there is a need to adequately support its implementation by providing handy decision support tools, understanding the power balances among municipalities, and defining proper interventions. The Indicator Grid, already used by the SNAI for project areas selection, can answer this need. However, the Grid’s application to support public policy at the municipality level requires reviewing some of its features, such as the indicators’ large number and the impossibility of defining some of them at the municipal scale. Based on these premises, this paper aims at supporting inner areas policies by carrying out a critical analysis of the current SNAI Grid, aimed at improving its effectiveness. It relies on a hybrid methodology that merges qualitative data interpretations and statistical analyses.

METHODS: Surfaces of objects were routinely wiped with 1000mg/L chlorine containing disinfectant. Air and sewage disinfection was proceeded routinely and strictly. Hospital environmental surfaces and PPE of staffs in isolation wards were sampled using swabs. The sewage from various inlet and outlets were sampled. The respiratory and stool specimens of patients were collected. The respiratory specimens of staffs in the isolation wards were also sampled once a week. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) methods were used to confirm the existence of SARS-Cov-2 RNA. Viral culture was done for the samples positive for SARS-Cov-2 RNA. RESULTS: During the study period, 33 laboratory-confirmed patients were hospitalized in isolation wards in the hospital. None of SARS-Cov-2 RNA was detected among the 36 objects surface samples and 9 staffs PPE samples in isolation wards. Though the 3 sewage samples from the inlet of preprocessing disinfection pool were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and the sample from the outlet of preprocessing disinfection pool was weakly positive, the sewage sample from the outlet of the last disinfection pool was negative. All of the 5 sewage samples from various points were negative by viral culture of SARS-Cov-2. None of the respiratory specimens of staffs in the isolation wards were positive. CONCLUSIONS: Though SARS-Cov-2 RNA of the sewage samples were positive from inlets of the sewage disinfection pool and negative from the outlet of the last sewage disinfection pool, no viable virus was detected by culture. The monitoring data in this study suggested that the strict disinfection and hand hygiene could decrease the hospital-associated COVID-19 infection risk of the staffs in isolation wards.","Wang, Jie; Feng, Haiting; Zhang, Sheng; Ni, Zuowei; Ni, Lingmei; Chen, Yu; Zhuo, Lixin; Zhong, Zifeng; Qu, Tingting",Int J Infect Dis,277,20

Music preferences and listening strategies have been shown to be associated with the psychological well-being of listeners including internalized symptomatology and depression. However, till date no studies exist that examine time-varying music consumption, in terms of acoustic content, and its association with users' well-being. In the current study, we aim at unearthing static and dynamic patterns prevalent in active listening behavior of individuals which may be used as indicators of risk for depression. Mental well-being scores and listening histories of 541 Last.fm users were examined. Static and dynamic acoustic and emotion-related features were extracted from each user's listening history and correlated with their mental well-being scores. Results revealed that individuals with greater depression risk resort to higher dependency on music with greater repetitiveness in their listening activity. Furthermore, the affinity of depressed individuals towards music that can be perceived as sad was found to be resistant to change over time. This study has large implications for future work in the area of assessing mental illness risk by exploiting digital footprints of users via online music streaming platforms.","Surana, Aayush; Goyal, Yash; Alluri, Vinoo",,277,7

Background: Protective measures to combat the COVID-19 pandemic are associated with isolation among people in need of elderly care. Due to the known adverse effects of social isolation on health, discussions have been held about the ethical legitimacy and commensurability of these measures. AIM: The article aims to show in which format the discourse in scientific publication on protective measures against COVID-19 took place and which contents have been addressed. METHODS: A mapping review in PubMed has been conducted. All publication types of scientific papers on nursing care of older people were considered. The results were synthesized in form of a quantitative content analysis of key aspects. RESULTS: The 38 articles included in the synthesis show that only a small part of the scientific publications on the COVID-19 pandemic deals with people living in nursing homes. Although critical aspects related to the isolation caused by the protective measures against the COVID-19 pandemic are named in half of the contributions, specific measures to address the negative effects of the isolation are rarely mentioned. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for further activities in research and nursing practice in order to meet the demand and desiderata of those in need of care and to enable personal responsibility and self-determination even in a special situation such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Fischer, Florian; Raiber, Lea; Boscher, Claudia; Winter, Maik H-J",Pflege,277,16

MATERIALS: We evaluated trends in patient encounters and laboratory testing for DM in a pediatric healthcare system from March to September 2019 and during the same period in 2020. RESULTS: Evaluation of 17,367 patient encounters illustrated that the pandemic was associated with significantly fewer in-person office visits and point-of-care HbA1c tests for patients with DM in 2020 relative to 2019. A separate analysis of 7,193 HbA1c results measured by point-of-care testing in the general population found a significant increase in the number of measured HbA1c >14 % in May 2020 relative to 2019, but other measured HbA1c values did not differ. As a means to address lapses in the monitoring of HbA1c due to the pandemic, we evaluated the use of the dried blood spot (DBS) matrix for measurement of HbA1c by the Vitros 5600 chemistry analyzer. DBS HbA1c was well correlated to whole blood (r=0.9889) and exhibited intra- and inter-assay precision from 0.5-3.5%. CONCLUSION: DBS measurement of HbA1c presents a viable alternative to routine in-person laboratory monitoring of DM. © 2021 by the Association of Clinical Scientists, Inc.","Garnett, E.

Thirteen healthcare workers from Italian and Austrian hospitals specifically dealing with COVID-19 patients during the first phase of the pandemic were interviewed. Data was analysed using grounded theory methodology. Psychosocial effects on stress experience, stressors and resilience factors were identified. We generated three hypotheses. Hypothesis one is that moral distress and moral injury are main stressors experienced by healthcare workers. Hypothesis two states that organisational resilience plays an important part in how healthcare workers experience the crisis. Organisational justice and decentralized decision making are essential elements of staff wellbeing. Hypothesis three refers to effective psychosocial support: Basic on scene psychosocial support based on the Hobfoll principles given by trusted and well-known mental health professionals and peers in an integrated approach works best during the pandemic.","Kreh, Alexander; Brancaleoni, Rachele; Magalini, Sabina Chiara; Chieffo, Daniela Pia Rosaria; Flad, Barbara; Ellebrecht, Nils; Juen, Barbara",PLoS One,277,26

In turn, this situation is leading to the decline of certain mainstream business formats and, simultaneously, the emergence of others. Based on a review of recent crisis recovery processes, the tourism sector is likely to rebound from this sudden market shock, primarily because of various forms of government interventions. Nevertheless, although policymakers seek to strengthen the resilience of post-pandemic tourism, their subsidies and other initiatives serve to maintain a fundamentally flawed market logic. The crisis has, therefore, brought us to a fork in the road–giving us the perfect opportunity to select a new direction and move forward by adopting a more sustainable path. Specifically, COVID-19 offers public, private, and academic actors a unique opportunity to design and consolidate the transition towards a greener and more balanced tourism.

Potentially Preventable Hospitalisations (PPH) for physical health conditions are an indicator of health service access, integration and effectiveness, and are elevated in long term studies of people with MH conditions. We aimed to examine whether PPH rates were elevated in MH service users over a 12-month follow-up period more suitable for routine health indicator reporting. We also examined whether MH service users had increased PPH rates at a younger age, potentially reflecting the younger onset of chronic physical conditions. METHODS: A population-wide data linkage in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, population 7.8 million. PPH rates in 178 009 people using community MH services in 2016-2017 were compared to population rates. Primary outcomes were crude and age- and disadvantage-standardised annual PPH episode rate (episodes per 100 000 population), PPH day rate (hospital days per 100 000) and adjusted incidence rate ratios (AIRR). RESULTS: MH service users had higher rates of PPH admission (AIRR 3.6, 95% CI 3.5-3.6) and a larger number of hospital days (AIRR 5.2, 95% CI 5.2-5.3) than other NSW residents due to increased likelihood of admission, more admissions per person and longer length of stay. Increases were greatest for vaccine-preventable conditions (AIRR 4.7, 95% CI 4.5-5.0), and chronic conditions (AIRR 3.7, 95% CI 3.6-3.7). The highest number of admissions and relative risks were for respiratory and metabolic conditions, including chronic obstructive airways disease (AIRR 5.8, 95% CI 5.5-6.0) and diabetic complications (AIRR 5.4, 95% CI 5.1-5.8). One-quarter of excess potentially preventable bed days in MH service users were due to vaccine-related conditions, including vaccine-preventable respiratory illness. Age-related increases in risk occurred earlier in MH service users, particularly for chronic and vaccine-preventable conditions. PPH rates in MH service users aged 20-29 were similar to population rates of people aged 60 and over. These substantial differences were not explained by socio-economic disadvantage. CONCLUSIONS: PPHs for physical health conditions are substantially increased in people with MH conditions. Short term (12-month) PPH rates may be a useful lead indicator of increased physical morbidity and less accessible, integrated or effective health care. High hospitalisation rates for vaccine-preventable respiratory infections and hepatitis underline the importance of vaccination in MH service users and suggests potential benefits of prioritising this group for COVID-19 vaccination.","Sara, G; Chen, W; Large, M; Ramanuj, P; Curtis, J; McMillan, F; Mulder, C L; Currow, D; Burgess, P",Epidemiol Psychiatr Sci,277,32

We argue that epidemics are 'fire objects', using a term coined by Law and Singleton: They generate locative fears through encounters that focus attention on entities that are unknown or imprecisely known, transforming spaces and humans into indeterminate dangers, alternating appearance and absence. The Ebola epidemic of 2014 had more complex impacts than the number of infections would suggest. We employ multi-sited qualitative interviews to argue that locative fear is the essence of modern global epidemics. In the discussion we contrast Ebola with both the Zika epidemic that followed and the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.","Shrum, Wesley; Aggrey, John; Campos, Andre; Pamplona da Costa, Janaina; Joseph, Jan; Kreimer, Pablo; Kroeger, Rhiannon; Rodriguez Medina, Leandro; Miller, Paige; Palackal, Antony; Pandal de la Peza, Ana; Traore, Abou",Soc Stud Sci,277,14

We aimed to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on psychological status, self-management behaviors, and diabetes care maintenance among Saudi adults with T1DM using insulin pump therapy. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used a web survey to collect data on Saudi adults with T1DM who were treated in the specialized insulin pump clinic at King Abdulaziz Medical City-Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. We used the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and General Anxiety Disorder-7 scales to measure depression and anxiety. RESULTS: Of the 70 patients who received the survey, 65 completed it. Overall, 23.1% and 29.2% of the patients reported moderate to severe and mild depression, respectively; 18.5% and 24.6% reported moderate to severe and mild anxiety, respectively. Compared with pre-lockdown, adherence to a healthy diet and regular physical activity decreased in 67.7% and 41.5% of the patients, respectively. Most patients maintained their adherence to insulin pump behaviors; frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose increased in 47% of glucometer users. Most patients benefited from phone visits or virtual education sessions, but 66.2% of the patients reported difficulty obtaining at least one type of insulin pump supply. CONCLUSIONS: Promoting self-management behaviors and psychological wellbeing of patients with T1DM using insulin pump therapy is crucial during a lockdown. Telemedicine is a useful alternative to in-person appointments, but strategies to ensure that patients have access to adequate resources during lockdown must be developed.","Magliah, Sultan F; Zarif, Hawazen A; Althubaiti, Alaa; Sabban, Mahmoud F",Diabetes Metab Syndr,277,6

Patients with hematologic malignancies typically are known to have higher levels of immunosuppression and may develop more severe respiratory viral infections than patients with solid tumors. Data on COVID-19 in patients with hematologic malignancies are limited. Here we characterize disease severity and mortality and evaluate potential prognostic factors for mortality. METHODS: In this population-based registry study, we collected de-identified data on clinical characteristics, treatment and outcomes in adult patients with hematologic malignancies and confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection within the Madrid region of Spain. Our case series included all patients admitted to 22 regional health service hospitals and 5 private healthcare centers between February 28 and May 25, 2020. The primary study outcome was all-cause mortality. We assessed the association between mortality and potential prognostic factors using Cox regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, comorbidities, hematologic malignancy and recent active cancer therapy. RESULTS: Of 833 patients reported, 697 were included in the analyses. Median age was 72 years (IQR 60-79), 413 (60%) patients were male and 479 (69%) and 218 (31%) had lymphoid and myeloid malignancies, respectively. Clinical severity of COVID-19 was severe/critical in 429 (62%) patients. At data cutoff, 230 (33%) patients had died. Age &#8805; 60 years (hazard ratios 3.17-10.1 vs < 50 years), > 2 comorbidities (1.41 vs &#8804; 2), acute myeloid leukemia (2.22 vs non-Hodgkin lymphoma) and active antineoplastic treatment with monoclonal antibodies (2·02) were associated with increased mortality; conventional chemotherapy showed borderline significance (1.50 vs no active therapy). Conversely, Ph-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (0.33) and active treatment with hypomethylating agents (0.47) were associated with lower mortality. Overall, 574 (82%) patients received antiviral therapy. Mortality with severe/critical COVID-19 was higher with no therapy vs any antiviral combination therapy (2.20). CONCLUSIONS: In this series of patients with hematologic malignancies and COVID-19, mortality was associated with higher age, more comorbidities, type of hematological malignancy and type of antineoplastic therapy. Further studies and long-term follow-up are required to validate these criteria for risk stratification.","García-Suárez, Julio; de la Cruz, Javier; Cedillo, Ángel; Llamas, Pilar; Duarte, Rafael; Jiménez-Yuste, Víctor; Hernández-Rivas, José Ángel; Gil-Manso, Rodrigo; Kwon, Mi; Sánchez-Godoy, Pedro; Martínez-Barranco, Pilar; Colás-Lahuerta, Blanca; Herrera, Pilar; Benito-Parra, Laurentino; Alegre, Adrián; Velasco, Alberto; Matilla, Arturo; Aláez-Usón, María Concepción; Martos-Martínez, Rafael; Martínez-Chamorro, Carmen; Susana-Quiroz, Keina; Del Campo, Juan Francisco; de la Fuente, Adolfo; Herráez, Regina; Pascual, Adriana; Gómez, Elvira; Pérez-Oteyza, Jaime; Ruiz, Elena; Alonso, Arancha; González-Medina, José; Martín-Buitrago, Lucía Núñez; Canales, Miguel; González-Gascón, Isabel; Vicente-Ayuso, María Carmen; Valenciano, Susana; Roa, María García; Monteliu, Pablo Estival; López-Jiménez, Javier; Escobar, Cristián Escolano; Ortiz-Martín, Javier; Diez-Martin, José Luis; Martinez-Lopez, Joaquín",J Hematol Oncol,277,20

Quantitative structure-activity relationships for SARS-CoV are developed and proposed in this study. The statistical quality of these models is quite good. Mechanistic interpretation of developed models is based on the statistical and probability quality of molecular alerts extracted from SMILES. The novel, designed structures of molecules able to possess anti-SARS activities are suggested.

For low values of the initial virus density (lower than the critical value) it is proved that the virus-diffusion behavior is safe and quantitatively similar to usual real epidemical data. However, it is revealed that very close to the critical point, the critical slowing-down (CSD) phenomenon, introduced by the theory of critical phenomena, emerges, leading to a tremendous increase of both the percentage of active carriers and the duration of the epidemic. A behavior of the epidemic obeying to a second order phase transition, also occurs. For virus density values higher than the critical value, the epidemic duration becomes extremely prolonged. Additionally, the effect of the closed system population size revealed interesting properties. All these results, together with an investigation of the effectiveness of applying physical contact restriction measures, document scientifically their worthiness, while they also demonstrate the limits for which herd immunity holds safely. Finally, the model has been compared against real epidemic data in the case of Greece, which imposed restrictive measures consistently and in time.","Contoyiannis, Y.; Stavrinides, S. G.; Hanias, M.

The hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a long-neglected RNA virus and the major causative agent of acute viral hepatitis in humans worldwide. However, the mechanisms of liver pathology and clinical disease remain poorly understood for HEV infection. This review summarizes our current understanding of HEV-host cell interactions and highlights experimental strategies and techniques to identify novel host components required for the viral life cycle as well as restriction factors. Understanding these interactions will provide insight into the viral life cycle of HEV and might further help to devise novel therapeutic strategies and antiviral targets.","Wißing, Michael H; Brüggemann, Yannick; Steinmann, Eike; Todt, Daniel",Trends microbiol,277,1

The gravity model is a widely-used approach for estimating and predicting population flows in urban mobility networks, assuming the scale-free property. Prior studies have reported good performance results for the gravity model at certain levels of aggregation. However, the characteristics of urban mobility networks might vary depending on the spatial and temporal resolutions of data. Hence, the sensitivity of gravity model performance to variation in the level of aggregation of data and the temporal and spatial scale of urban mobility networks needs to be examined. The basic gravity model is tested on urban mobility networks on an hourly and daily scale using fine-grained location-based human mobility data for multiple US metropolitan counties to address this gap. The findings suggest that: (1) finer-scale urban mobility networks do not demonstrate a scale-free property; (2) the performance of the basic gravity model decays for predicting population flow in the finer-scale urban mobility networks; (3) the variations in population density distribution and mobility network structure and properties across counties do not significantly influence the performance of gravity models. Hence, gravity models may not be suitable for modeling urban mobility networks with daily or hourly aggregation of census tract to census tract movements. The findings highlight the need for new urban mobility network models or machine learning approaches to predict fine-scale and high temporal-resolution urban mobility networks better.","Hsu, Chiawei; Fan, Chao; Mostafavi, Ali",,277,25

However, many report that they lack the knowledge and confidence to do so, and few mental health training programs available for educators are evidence based. To address this gap, the Black Dog Institute (BDI) developed a web-based training program (Building Educators' Skills in Adolescent Mental Health [BEAM]) that aims to improve mental health knowledge, confidence, and helping behaviors among secondary school educators in leadership positions. A pilot study of the training program found it to be positively associated with increased confidence and helping behaviors among educators and reduced personal psychological distress. An adequately powered randomized controlled trial (RCT) is needed. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this cluster RCT is to evaluate the effectiveness of the BEAM program for improving educators' confidence in managing student mental health. The trial will also evaluate the effect of the BEAM program in increasing educators' frequency of providing help to students and improving their mental health knowledge and reducing educators' psychological distress and stigma toward students with mental health issues. METHODS: The target sample size is 234 educators from 47 secondary schools across New South Wales, Australia. Four waves of recruitment and enrollment into the trial are planned. Schools will participate in one wave only and will be randomized to the intervention or waitlist control conditions. Participants from the same school will be assigned to the same condition. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, posttest (10 weeks after baseline), and follow-up (22 weeks after baseline) using the BDI eHealth research platform. Intervention participants will receive access to the BEAM program for 10 weeks upon completion of baseline, and the control condition will receive access for 10 weeks upon completion of the follow-up assessment. RESULTS: Recruitment for this trial began on July 21, 2020, with the first baseline assessments occurring on August 17, 2020. To date, 295 participants from 71 schools have completed baseline. Due to the unexpected success of recruitment in the first 3 waves, the final fourth wave has been abandoned. Intervention participants are currently receiving the program, with follow-up due for completion in March 2021. CONCLUSIONS: This is one of the first RCTs to examine the effectiveness of a web-based adolescent mental health training program for Australian secondary school educators in leadership positions. If found to be effective, this training program will offer a sustainable and scalable delivery method for upskilling educators in caring for students' mental health.

Improved infection prevention and control (IPC) programmes can protect HCWs, especially in resource-limited settings where the health workforce is scarcest, and ensure patient safety and continuity of essential health services. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we collaborated with ministries of health and development partners to implement an emergency initiative for HCWs at the primary health facility level in 22 African countries. Between April 2020 and January 2021, the initiative trained 42 058 front-line HCWs from 8444 health facilities, supported longitudinal supervision and monitoring visits guided by a standardised monitoring tool, and provided resources including personal protective equipment (PPE). We documented significant short-term improvements in IPC performance, but gaps remain. Suspected HCW infections peaked at 41.5% among HCWs screened at monitored facilities in July 2020 during the first wave of the pandemic in Africa. Disease-specific emergency responses are not the optimal approach. Comprehensive, sustainable IPC programmes are needed. IPC needs to be incorporated into all HCW training programmes and combined with supportive supervision and mentorship. Strengthened data systems on IPC are needed to guide improvements at the health facility level and to inform policy development at the national level, along with investments in infrastructure and sustainable supplies of PPE. Multimodal strategies to improve IPC are critical to make health facilities safer and to protect HCWs and the communities they serve.","Patel, Leena N; Kozikott, Samantha; Ilboudo, Rodrigue; Kamateeka, Moreen; Lamorde, Mohammed; Subah, Marion; Tsiouris, Fatima; Vorndran, Anna; Lee, Christopher T",,277,16

Methods • A total of 320 patients admitted to Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center from January to March 2020 and diagnosed as having coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) were selected. Clinical data of the patients were collected to analyze their characteristics. Using the statistical operation formula of R language, the correlation analysis of hospitalization days, days of increased hypersensitive C-reactive protein concentration (allergic days), days of lung CT improvement (CT days), and days required for nucleic acid turning negative with the main clinical manifestations and laboratory data was carried out. The correlation factors affecting the above four variables were analyzed. Results • Among the 320 patients, the proportions of mild type, moderate type, serious type and critical type were 6.25%, 83.44%, 6.88% and 3.44%, respectively; 91.25% of them had a history of exposure to Hubei. The proportions of fever, cough, sputum and fatigue were 79.06%, 46.56%, 21.56% and 15.31%, respectively. Spearman correlation analysis showed that the concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase, interleukin-2(IL-2) and IL-6 were positively correlated with the above four variables, respectively (all P&lt;0.05), albumin concentration was negatively correlated with allergic days (P=0.018), and CD4+ cell count was negatively correlated with CT days and days required for nucleic acid turning negative (both P&lt;0.05).

METHODOLOGY: This was a cross-sectional, descriptive study. The data were collected prospectively. Our study covered the period from March to May 2020. All consenting patients seen at the IOTA Teaching Hospital for ocular trauma regardless of gender, age, circumstances in which the trauma occurred or the nature of the injuries were included by non-probability sampling.

RESULTS: There were a total of 138 cases, of which 84 were male and 54 female, for a gender ratio of M/F=1.5. Children aged 0 to 5 years represented more than 3/4 (79.14%) of our sample. Trauma occurred in 45.83% of cases during leisure activities and 3.60% of cases involved domestic violence. DISCUSSION: According to the authors, measures aimed at limiting public movement, particularly the curfews introduced by the Malian government to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, may actually result in trauma. CONCLUSION: Raising public awareness of the social and psychological consequences of lock-down through audiovisual means might significantly reduce the frequency of these ocular traumas.","Sissoko, M; Guirou, N; Romuald Elien G Y, R; Saye, G; Simaga, A; Diallo, H; Bakozo Tatangba, A; Sylla, F",J Fr Ophtalmol,277,22

Therefore, health systems should make strategic shifts to ensure that limited resources provide the highest benefit for COVID-19 patients. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe the risk factors associated with poor in-hospital outcomes to help clinicians make better patient care decisions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective observational study enrolled 176 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients. Demographic characteristics, clinical data, lymphocyte count, CT imaging findings on admission, and clinical outcomes were collected and compared. Two radiologists evaluated the distribution and CT features of the lesions and also scored the extent of lung involvement. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine the optimum cutoff point for possible effective variables on patients' outcomes. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine the risk factors associated with ICU admission and in-hospital death. RESULT: Thirty-eight (21.5%) patients were either died or admitted to ICU from a total of 176 enrolled ones. The mean age of the patients was 57.5 ± 16.1 years (males: 61%). The best cutoff point for predicting poor outcomes based on age, CT score, and O2 saturation was 60 years (sensitivity: 71%, specificity: 62%), 10.5 (sensitivity: 73%, specificity: 58%), and 90.5% (sensitivity: 73%, specificity: 59%), respectively. CT score cutoff point was rounded to 11 since this score contains only integer numbers. Multivariable-adjusted regression models revealed that ages of &#8805; 60 years, CT score of &#8805; 11, and O2 saturation of &#8804; 90.5% were associated with higher worse outcomes among study population (odds ratio (OR): 3.62, 95%CI: 1.35-9.67, P = 0.019; OR: 4.38, 95%CI: 1.69-11.35, P = 0.002; and OR: 2.78, 95%CI: 1.03-7.47, P = 0.042, respectively). CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that older age, higher CT score, and lower O2 saturation could be categorized as predictors of poor outcome among COVID-19-infected patients. Other studies are required to prove these associations.","Shayganfar, Azin; Sami, Ramin; Sadeghi, Somayeh; Dehghan, Mehrnegar; Khademi, Nilufar; Rikhtegaran, Reyhaneh; Basiratnia, Reza; Ferdosi, Felora; Hajiahmadi, Somayeh",Emerg. radiol,277,26

Efficacy of treatments for retinal vascular diseases such as wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD) depend on strict adherence to regimens of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injections. The purpose of this study is to describe and compare the number of bevacizumab injections administered in 2019 and 2020 to determine if the COVID-19 pandemic may have affected usage. Methods : We conducted a single-center, retrospective observational study which compared the number of bevacizumab injections in January through November 2020 with the number of bevacizumab injections in 2019. The total number of injections for each month and year were compared.Results : The total number of bevacizumab injections in 2020 (Jan-Nov) was 683 compared to 801 in 2019 (Jan-Nov), a 14.7% reduction (p = 0.02). Significantly fewer injections were administered in March, April, and May 2020 (p < 0.01), and from August to November (p < 0.01). The fewest number of injections for 2020 were administered in April (n = 45) and May (n = 45). Conclusions : In this patient population, a significant reduction in bevacizumab injections occurred during the COVID pandemic, and the drop in injections was first seen in March 2020 which coincided with stay-at-home orders within the catchment area. These data suggest that the Covid-19 pandemic likely affected the number of patients coming to the retina clinic. Additional data is needed to determine if other factors may have contributed to this decline, and if these missed visits has adversely affected visual acuity outcomes.","Perlroth, A.; Mishra, K.; Do, D.

Surgeries have been triaged according to their level of urgencies and arteriovenous fistula (AVF) operations were among elective surgeries. This study aimed to analyze the effect of vascular access on the outcomes of hemodialysis patients who had COVID-19. METHODS: One hundred four hemodialysis patients who had COVID-19 were retrospectively analyzed. Seventy-two of them had AVF as the vascular access while 32 of them had tunneled catheters. Inflammatory markers and outcomes of patients with AVFs and catheters were compared. A logistic regression analysis was performed in order to define factors that contribute to better outcomes in hemodialysis patients. RESULTS: COVID-19 had high mortality rate in hemodialysis patients (36.5%). Patients with catheters have higher peak ferritin levels (p = 0.02) and longer hospital stay (p = 0.00). Having AVF as the vascular access (OR = 3.36; 95% CI: 1.05-10.72; p = 0.041) and using medium cut-off dialyzers (OR = 7.99; 95% CI: 1.53-41.65; p = 0.014) were related to higher survival of the patients. COVID severity was inversely proportional to the survival (p = 0.000). CONCLUSIONS: AVFs contribute to higher survival of hemodialysis patients with COVID-19. Even in the pandemic era, end stage renal disease patients should be given the opportunity to have their vascular access properly created.","Murt, Ahmet; Yadigar, Serap; Yalin, Serkan Feyyaz; Dincer, Mevlut Tamer; Parmaksiz, Ergun; Altiparmak, Mehmet Riza",J Vasc Access,277,1

In pythons, nidovirus (recently reclassified as serpentovirus) infection induces an inflammation of the upper respiratory and alimentary tract which can develop into a severe, often fatal proliferative pneumonia. We observed pyogranulomatous and fibrinonecrotic lesions in organ systems other than the respiratory tract during full postmortem examinations on 30 serpentovirus reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR)-positive pythons of varying species originating from Switzerland and Spain. The observations prompted us to study whether this not yet reported wider distribution of lesions is associated with previously unknown serpentoviruses or changes in the serpentovirus genome. RT-PCR and inoculation of Morelia viridis cell cultures served to recruit the cases and obtain virus isolates. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining against serpentovirus nucleoprotein demonstrated that the virus infects not only a broad spectrum of epithelia (respiratory and alimentary epithelium, hepatocytes, renal tubules, pancreatic ducts, etc.), but also intravascular monocytes, intralesional macrophages, and endothelial cells. With next-generation sequencing we obtained a full-length genome for a novel serpentovirus species circulating in Switzerland. Analysis of viral genomes recovered from pythons showing serpentovirus infection-associated respiratory or systemic disease did not reveal sequence association to phenotypes; however, functional studies with different strains are needed to confirm this observation. The results indicate that serpentoviruses have a broad cell and tissue tropism, further suggesting that the course of infection could vary and involve lesions in a broad spectrum of tissues and organ systems as a consequence of monocyte-mediated viral systemic spread.IMPORTANCE During the last years, python nidoviruses (now reclassified as serpentoviruses) have become a primary cause of fatal disease in pythons. Serpentoviruses represent a threat to captive snake collections, as they spread rapidly and can be associated with high morbidity and mortality. Our study indicates that, different from previous evidence, the viruses do not only affect the respiratory tract, but can spread in the entire body with blood monocytes, have a broad spectrum of target cells, and can induce a variety of lesions. Nidovirales is an order of animal and human viruses that comprises important zoonotic pathogens such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2. Serpentoviruses belong to the same order as the above-mentioned human viruses and show similar characteristics (rapid spread, respiratory and gastrointestinal tropism, etc.). The present study confirms the relevance of natural animal diseases to better understand the complexity of viruses of the order Nidovirales.","Dervas, Eva; Hepojoki, Jussi; Smura, Teemu; Prähauser, Barbara; Windbichler, Katharina; Blümich, Sandra; Ramis, Antonio; Hetzel, Udo; Kipar, Anja",J. virol,277,16

To answer these questions, decision makers need to be able to determine the location of the required resources over time based on emerging hot spot locations. Hot spots are defined as concentrated areas with sharp increases in COVID19 cases. Hot spots place stress on existing healthcare resources, resulting in demand for resources potentially exceeding current capacity. This research will describe a value based resource allocation approach that seeks to coordinate demand, as defined by uncertain epidemiological forecasts, with the value of adding additional resources such as hospital beds. Value is framed as a function of the expected usage of a marginal resource (bed, ventilator, etc). Subject to certain constraints, allocation decisions are operationalized using a nonlinear programming model, allocating new hospital beds over time and across a number of geographical locations. The results of the research show a need for a value based approach to assist decision makers at all levels in making the best possible decisions in the current highly uncertain and dynamic COVID environment.","Collier, Zachary A.; Keisler, Jeffrey M.; Trump, Benjamin D.; Cegan, Jeffrey C.; Wolberg, Sarah; Linkov, Igor",,277,24

BACKGROUND: This review is the first qualitative systematic review of nurses' experiences since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Understanding nurses' experiences with COVID-19 is important because nurses are among the most vital of healthcare workers. METHODS: This study used a qualitative systematic review methodology with thematic synthesis to analyse the included studies. Five databases (CINAHL, PubMed, Ovid, Web of Science, and PsycINFO) were searched from January to mid-August 2020, and 25 abstracts were screened. Based on inclusion criteria, this qualitative systematic review included nine studies. RESULTS: Five themes were identified as barriers to COVID-19 care by 133 hospital-based nurses: limited information about COVID-19, unpredictable tasks and challenging practices, insufficient support, concerns about family, and emotional and psychological stress. CONCLUSIONS: The five barriers identified in this review should be overcome to improve nurses' experiences and, in turn, the quality of care patients with COVID-19 receive. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING AND HEALTH POLICY: The findings from this review can be used to reform current healthcare and hospital-support systems for populations with COVID-19. They can also be used to point towards areas of research interested in improving frontline nursing. Finally, nursing leaders, healthcare policymakers and governments should use these findings to better support the nursing workforce in the current or a future pandemic.","Joo, Jee Young; Liu, Megan F",Int. nurs. rev,277,5

DESIGN: Community-based retrospective cohort. SETTING: Primary Health Care Tarragona region. PARTICIPANTS: 282 community-dwelling symptomatic patients &#8805;50 years with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (hospitalised and/or outpatient) during March-June 2020 in Tarragona (Southern Catalonia, Spain). MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Relationship between demographics, pre-existing comorbidities and early symptomatology (first 5-days) and risk of suffering critical outcome (ICU-admission/death) across clinical course was evaluated by logistic regression analyses, and simple predictive models were developed. RESULTS: Of the 282 cases (mean age: 65.9 years; 140 men), 154 (54.6%) were hospitalised (30 ICU-admitted) and 45 (16%) deceased. Median time follow-up in clinical course was 31 days (range: 30-150) for survivors and 14 days (range: 1-81) for deceased patients. In crude analyses, increasing age, male sex, some comorbidities (renal, respiratory or cardiac disease, diabetes and hypertension) and symptoms (confusion, dyspnoea) were associated with an increased risk to suffer critical outcome, whereas other symptoms (rinorrhea, myalgias, headache, anosmia/disgeusia) were related with reduced risk. After multivariable-adjustment only age/years (OR: 1.04; 95% CI: 1.01-1.07; p=0.004), confusion (OR: 5.33; 95% CI: 1.54-18.48; p=0.008), dyspnoea (OR: 5.41; 95% CI: 2.74-10.69; p<0.001) and myalgias (OR: 0.30; 95% CI: 0.10-0.93; p=0.038) remained significantly associated with increased or reduced risk.

METHODS: Using a lentiviral-vector-based SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay to measure Nabs, we characterised 150 patients randomly selected from a cohort of 509 patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. We analysed Nab response according to the presence of diabetes or hyperglycaemia, at the time of hospitalisation and during the post discharge follow-up, i.e., 1, 3 and 6 months outpatient visits. RESULTS: Among 150 randomly selected patients 40 (26.6%) had diabetes. Diabetes (HR 8.9, p < 0.001), glucose levels (HR 1.25 x 1.1 mmol/L, p < 0.001) and glucose variability (HR 1.17 x 0.6 mmol/L, p < 0.001) were independently associated with an increased risk of mortality. The neutralizing activity of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in patients with diabetes was superimposable, as for kinetics and extent, to that of patients without diabetes. It was similar across glucose levels and correlated with the humoral response against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Positivity for Nabs at the time of hospital admission conferred protection on mortality, both in the presence (HR 0.28, p=0.046) or absence of diabetes (HR 0.26, p=0.030). The longevity of the Nab response was not affected by diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes and hyperglycaemia do not affect the kinetics and durability of the neutralizing antibody response to SARS-CoV-2.

Spike glycan processing and cleavage, which occur in the Golgi network, are important for fusion at the plasma membrane, promoting both virion infectivity and cell-to-cell viral spreading. We show that a KxHxx motif in the cytosolic tail of spike weakly binds the COPß' subunit of COPI coatomer, which facilitates some recycling of spike within the Golgi, while releasing the remainder to the cell surface. Although histidine (KxHxx) has been proposed to be equivalent to lysine within di-lysine endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retrieval sequences, we show that histidine-to-lysine substitution (KxKxx) retains spike at the ER and prevents glycan processing, protease cleavage, and transport to the plasma membrane.","Jennings, Benjamin C; Kornfeld, Stuart; Doray, Balraj",FEBS Lett,277,33

However, the underlying neural mechanisms of persistence and the methods that enhance the neuroplasticity underlying persistence, remain unclear. We here demonstrate that the structural properties of the frontal pole cortex (FPC) before tasks contain information that can classify Achievers and Non-achievers (goal-directed persistence) participating in three tasks that differ in time scale (hours to months) and task domains (cognitive, language, and motor learning). We also found that most Achievers exhibit experience-dependent neuroplastic changes in the FPC after completing language and motor learning tasks. Moreover, we confirmed that a coaching strategy that used subgoals modified goal-directed persistence and increased the likelihood of becoming an Achiever. Notably, we discovered that neuroplastic changes in the FPC were facilitated by the subgoal strategy, suggesting that goal-striving, using effective coaching, optimizes the FPC for goal persistence.","Hosoda, Chihiro; Tsujimoto, Satoshi; Tatekawa, Masaru; Honda, Manabu; Osu, Rieko; Hanakawa, Takashi",Commun Biol,277,14

Design/methodology/approach: The methodologies used in this study include triangulation of Google search engine, survey and post hoc case study analysis. Findings: The analysis indicates a decline both in procuring office space and its price per square meter. Employee productivity while teleworking remains relatively high despite home distractions. Interestingly, the survey results forecast a continuous shift to hybrid work mode after the pandemic. Practical implications: The study introduces the development of numerous innovative Israeli technologies to allow a gradual return to work in public places. Social implications: As the coronavirus outburst, business sectors were forced by government regulations to change the way of employment extensively, specifically, teleworking has become an integral part of the routine to accommodate social distance. The study provides insights into the impact of teleworking on gender and ethnic diversity in the Israeli workplace. Originality/value: Israel provides a unique bedrock for investigation because of its status as a start-up nation with both high skilled workforce and advanced information technology infrastructure. The study enlightens an Israeli perspective on how a small size country with a high-density population succeeds to deal with coronavirus by teleworking coupled with strict government enforcement of social distance. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Naor, M.; Pinto, G.

It is unclear whether this caused a shift towards more complicated cases of acute appendicitis. We compared a cohort of patients diagnosed with acute appendicitis during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic with a 2019 control cohort. METHODS: We retrospectively included consecutive adult patients in 21 hospitals presenting with acute appendicitis in a COVID-19 pandemic cohort (March 15 - April 30, 2020) and a control cohort (March 15 - April 30, 2019). Primary outcome was the proportion of complicated appendicitis. Secondary outcomes included prehospital delay, appendicitis severity, and postoperative complication rates. RESULTS: The COVID-19 pandemic cohort comprised 607 patients vs. 642 patients in the control cohort. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a higher proportion of complicated appendicitis was seen (46.9% vs. 38.5%; p = 0.003). More patients had symptoms exceeding 24 h (61.1% vs. 56.2%, respectively, p = 0.048). After correction for prehospital delay, presentation during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic was still associated with a higher rate of complicated appendicitis. Patients presenting > 24 h after onset of symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic were older (median 45 vs. 37 years; p = 0.001) and had more postoperative complications (15.3% vs. 6.7%; p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Although the incidence of acute appendicitis was slightly lower during the first wave of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, more patients presented with a delay and with complicated appendicitis than in a corresponding period in 2019. Spontaneous resolution of mild appendicitis may have contributed to the increased proportion of patients with complicated appendicitis. Late presenting patients were older and experienced more postoperative complications compared to the control cohort.","Scheijmans, Jochem C G; Borgstein, Alexander B J; Puylaert, Carl A J; Bom, Wouter J; Bachiri, Said; van Bodegraven, Eduard A; Brandsma, Amarins T A; Ter Brugge, Floor M; de Castro, Steve M M; Couvreur, Roy; Franken, Lotte C; Gaspersz, Marcia P; de Graaff, Michelle R; Groenen, Hannah; Kleipool, Suzanne C; Kuypers, Toon J L; Martens, Milou H; Mens, David M; Orsini, Ricardo G; Reneerkens, Nando J M M; Schok, Thomas; Sedee, Wouter J A; Tavakoli Rad, Shahzad; Volders, José H; Weeder, Pepijn D; Prins, Jan M; Gietema, Hester A; Stoker, Jaap; Gisbertz, Suzanne S; Besselink, Marc G H; Boermeester, Marja A",BMC Emerg Med,277,33

Yet, many US adults expressed reluctance. AIMS: The aim of this study was to compare persons willing and unwilling to be vaccinated against COVID-19 and to estimate the effects of vaccination attributes on uptake: proof of vaccination, vaccination setting, effectiveness, duration of immunity, and risk of severe side effects. METHOD: Between 9 and 11 November 2020, 1153 US adults completed a discrete choice experiment (DCE) on Phase 2 of the CDC Vaccination Program (August 2021). Each of its eight choice tasks had three vaccination alternatives and ""no vaccination for 6 months."" An opt-out inflated logit model was estimated to test for respondent differences and attribute effects. RESULTS: Respondent demographics were unrelated to one's willingness to be vaccinated (p value 0.533), but those with less education were more likely to be unwilling (p < 0.001). Among those willing, uptake ranged from 61.70 to 97.75%, depending on the vaccination attributes. Effectiveness and safety had the largest effects. Offering proof of vaccination and a choice of setting increased uptake as much as increasing immunity from 3 to 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: To maximize uptake, the CDC Program should standardize proof of vaccination and offer a choice of setting, instead of a one-size-fits-all approach. If the first-generation vaccines are efficacious, widely available, and free, overall predicted uptake is 68.81% by the end of Phase 2 (August 2021), which is well below the 75-90% needed for herd immunity. Further health preference research is necessary to uncover and address unwillingness and reluctance to vaccinate against COVID-19.","Craig, Benjamin Matthew",Patient,277,10

Current sampling practice risks loss of sample to the attached negative flow, aerosolisation, or spillage, due to repeated circuit breaks, when replacing sample containers. Such concerns were highlighted during the recent coronavirus pandemic. OBJECTIVES: Evaluation of an alternative integrated sampling solution, with the Ambu Bronchosampler with aScope 4, by an experienced bronchoscopist in ICU. METHODS: An observational study of 20 sequential bronchoscopic diagnostic sampling procedures was performed on mechanically ventilated patients with suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia. Mixed methods assessment was done. The predefined outcome measures were (1) ease of set up, (2) ease of specimen collection, (3) ease of protecting specimen from loss or spillage, and (4) overall workflow. The duration of the procedure and the % volume of sample retrieved were recorded. RESULTS: The mean (±standard deviation [SD]) time for collecting 1 sample was 2.5 ± 0.8 min. The mean (±SD) specimen yield for instilled miniBAL was 54.2 ± 17.9%. Compared with standard sampling, the set-up was much easier in 18 (90%), or easier in 2 (10%) of procedures, reducing the connection steps. It was much more intuitive to use in 14 (70%), more intuitive in 4 (20%), and no more intuitive to use in 2 (10%). The overall set-up and workflow was much easier in 69% of the 13 intraprocedural connections and easier or as easy in the remaining 31% procedures. All procedures where pre connection was established were much easier (7, 100%). The Ambu Bronchosampler remained upright in all procedures with no loss or spillage of sample. Obtaining a sample was much easier in 60%, easier in 10%, no different in 20%, and worse in 10%. The ability to protect a sample from start to finish compared to standard procedures was much easier in 80%, easier in 15%, and no different in 5% of procedures. Overall workflow was much easier in 14 (70%), easier in 4 (20%), and no different in 2 (10%) of procedures. CONCLUSIONS: The Ambu Bronchosampler unit was a reliable, effective, and possibly safer technique for diagnostic sampling in ICU. It may improve safety standards during the coronavirus pandemic.

Data were obtained on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs of patients with COVID-19 and asymptomatic carriers. The developed reagent kits provided 100% sensitivity and a detection limit of 103 GE / ml for qPCR, and at least 200 copies / ml of viral RNA when performing digital PCR. These methods were tested using a panel of 1,328 samples collected from patients with suspected COVID-19 at the beginning of 2020 in the Russian Federation. It has been shown that dPCR is more sensitive and can be used to analyze samples with low viral load, including those from patients without clinical symptoms. dPCR significantly improves the accuracy of laboratory research and significantly reduces the number of false negative results in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. Determination of the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in patients with different clinical course of the disease showed that the concentration of viral RNA can sharply decrease in the first days of the disease. A low concentration of viral RNA in samples from patients is also characteristic of asymptomatic disease. Digital PCR provides a higher detection rate for asymptomatic cases, which is approximately 75% of those infected, as opposed to 45% for real-time PCR. The results obtained on the use of the digital PCR method for detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA showed that this method is especially suitable for detecting RNA in case of its low concentration in contacts, as well as for monitoring changes in viral load in convalescent patients.","Ternovoi, V A; Lutkovsky, R Yu; Ponomareva, E P; Gladysheva, A V; Chub, E V; Tupota, N L; Smirnova, A M; Nazarenko, A A; Loktev, V B; Gavrilova, E V; Agafonov, A P; Maksyutov, R A",Klin Lab Diagn,277,27

We show that our model generates highly accurate forecasts up to seven days ahead and use estimated model components to cluster countries based on recent events. We introduce statistical novelty in terms of modelling the autoregressive parameter as a function of time, increasing predictive power and flexibility to adapt to each country. Our model can also be used to forecast the number of deaths, study the effects of covariates (such as lockdown policies), and generate forecasts for smaller regions within countries. Consequently, it has substantial implications for global planning and decision making. We present forecasts and make all results freely available to any country in the world through an online Shiny dashboard.","Oliveira, Thiago de Paula; Moral, Rafael de Andrade",Sci Rep,277,19

While travel restrictions and control measures have been shown to limit the spread of the disease, the effectiveness of the enforcement of those measures should depend on the strength of the government. Whether, and how, the government plays a role in fighting the disease, however, has not been investigated. Here, we show that government management capacities are critical to the containment of the disease. SETTING: We conducted a statistical analysis based on cross-city comparisons within China. China has undergone almost the entire cycle of the anticoronavirus campaign, which allows us to trace the full dynamics of the outbreak, with homogeneity in standards for statistics recording. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcome measures include city-specific COVID-19 case incidence and recoveries in China. RESULTS: The containment of COVID-19 depends on the effectiveness of the enforcement of control measures, which in turn depends on the local government's management capacities. Specifically, government efficiency, capacity for law enforcement, and the transparency of laws and policies significantly reduce COVID-19 prevalence and increase the likelihood of recoveries. The organisation size of the government, which is not closely related to its capacity for management, has a limited role.","Li, Wenchao; Li, Jing; Yi, Junjian",BMJ Open,277,24

Since this disease is highly contagious and 33% of cases are asymptomatic, it is crucial to develop methods to predict its course. We developed a predictive model for Covid-19 infection in Spanish provinces. METHODS: We applied main components analysis to epidemiological data for Spanish provinces obtained from the National Centre of Epidemiology, based on the epidemiological curve between 24 February and 8 June 2020. Using this method, we classified provinces according to their epidemiological progress (worst, intermediate, and good). RESULTS: We identified 2 components that explained 99% of variability in the 52 epidemiological curves. The first component can be interpreted as the crude incidence rate trend and the second component as the speed of increase or decrease in the incidence rate during the period analysed. We identified 10 provinces in the group with the worst progress and 17 in the intermediate group. The threshold values for the 7-day incidence rate for an alert 1 (intermediate) were 134 cases/100,000 inhabitants, and 167 for alert 2 (high), respectively, showing a high discriminative power between provinces. CONCLUSIONS: These alert levels might be useful for deciding which measures may affect population mobility and other public health decisions when considering community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in a given geographical area. This information would also facilitate intercomparison between healthcare areas and Autonomous Communities.","Santiago Pérez, María Isolina; López-Vizcaíno, Esther; Ruano-Ravina, Alberto; Pérez-Ríos, Mónica",Arch. bronconeumol.

We aimed to quantify potential drivers of this change and identify groups of patients who remain at high risk of dying in hospital. METHODS: In this multicentre prospective observational cohort study, the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infections Consortium WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol UK recruited a prospective cohort of patients with COVID-19 admitted to 247 acute hospitals in England, Scotland, and Wales during the first wave of the pandemic (between March 9 and Aug 2, 2020). We included all patients aged 18 years and older with clinical signs and symptoms of COVID-19 or confirmed COVID-19 (by RT-PCR test) from assumed community-acquired infection. We did a three-way decomposition mediation analysis using natural effects models to explore associations between week of admission and in-hospital mortality, adjusting for confounders (demographics, comorbidities, and severity of illness) and quantifying potential mediators (level of respiratory support and steroid treatment). The primary outcome was weekly in-hospital mortality at 28 days, defined as the proportion of patients who had died within 28 days of admission of all patients admitted in the observed week, and it was assessed in all patients with an outcome. This study is registered with the ISRCTN Registry, ISRCTN66726260. FINDINGS: Between March 9, and Aug 2, 2020, we recruited 80 713 patients, of whom 63 972 were eligible and included in the study. Unadjusted weekly in-hospital mortality declined from 32·3% (95% CI 31·8-32·7) in March 9 to April 26, 2020, to 16·4% (15·0-17·8) in June 15 to Aug 2, 2020. Reductions in mortality were observed in all age groups, in all ethnic groups, for both sexes, and in patients with and without comorbidities. After adjustment, there was a 32% reduction in the risk of mortality per 7-week period (odds ratio [OR] 0·68 [95% CI 0·65-0·71]). The higher proportions of patients with severe disease and comorbidities earlier in the first wave (March and April) than in June and July accounted for 10·2% of this reduction. The use of respiratory support changed during the first wave, with gradually increased use of non-invasive ventilation over the first wave. Changes in respiratory support and use of steroids accounted for 22·2%, OR 0·95 (0·94-0·95) of the reduction in in-hospital mortality. INTERPRETATION: The reduction in in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19 during the first wave in the UK was partly accounted for by changes in the case-mix and illness severity. A significant reduction in in-hospital mortality was associated with differences in respiratory support and critical care use, which could partly reflect accrual of clinical knowledge. The remaining improvement in in-hospital mortality is not explained by these factors, and could be associated with changes in community behaviour, inoculum dose, and hospital capacity strain.

Nurse staffing level is an important indicator of the quality of care. This study aimed to identify any changes in the nurse staffing levels in the general wards of hospitals in Korea during the COVID-19 pandemic. The unit of analysis was the hospitals. This longitudinal study observed the quarterly change of the nurse staffing grades in 969 hospitals in 2020. The nurse staffing grades ranged from 1 to 7 according to the nurse-patient ratio measured by the number of patients (or beds) per nurse. The major dependent and independent variables were the change of nurse staffing grades and three quarterly observation points being compared with those during the 1st quarter (1Q) of 2020, respectively. A generalized linear model was used. Unexpectedly, the nurse staffing grades significantly improved (2Q: RR, 27.2%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 15.1-27.6; p < 0.001; 3Q: RR, 95% CI, 20.2%; 16.9-21.6; p < 0.001; 4Q: RR, 26.6%; 95% CI, 17.8-39.6; p < 0.001) quarterly, indicating that the nurse staffing levels increased. In the comparison of grades at 2Q, 3Q, and 4Q with those at 1Q, most figures improved in tertiary, general, and small hospitals (p < 0.05), except at 3Q and 4Q of general hospitals. In conclusion, the nurse staffing levels did not decrease, but nursing shortage might occur.","Park, Young-Taek; Park, JeongYun; Jeon, Ji Soo; Kim, Young Jae; Kim, Kwang Gi",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),277,24

METHODS: Compressed movie clip ultrasound images (obstetric sweep protocol) obtained by minimally trained personnel were read and interpreted by physicians with training in obstetric ultrasound. Observed findings were compared among readers and between each reader and the gold standard ultrasound scan report. Descriptive statistics were used for the analysis. RESULTS: The agreements among readers and between readers and the gold standard, for the anterior and posterior variables of the placental location were excellent, with Cohen &#954; values of 0.81 to 0.88 and 0.77 to 0.9, respectively. Cohen &#954; values were slight or slight/fair for other placental locations (left, right, fundal, and low), and the sensitivity and specificity ranged widely. The agreement among readers and between readers and the gold standard for fetal number comparisons was also excellent, with Cohen &#954; values ranging from 0.82 to 1, sensitivity from 0.83 to 1, and specificity from 0.99 to 1. The agreement among readers for fetal presentation comparisons, according to the Cohen &#954;, ranged from 0.79 to 0.85 and between readers and the gold standard had values of 0.43 to 0.49. For biometric parameters and estimated gestational age calculations based on these parameters, inter-reader reliability ranged from 0.79 to 0.85 for all parameters except femur length. Greater than 94% of obstetric sweep protocol ultrasound ages were within 7 days of the corresponding gold standard age. CONCLUSIONS: Movie clip ultrasound images provided adequate information for remote readers to reliably determine the placental location, fetal number, fetal presentation, and pregnancy dating.","Dougherty, Anne; Kasten, Miriam; DeSarno, Michael; Badger, Gary; Streeter, Mary; Jones, David C; Sussman, Betsy; DeStigter, Kristen",J. ultrasound med,277,16

Hypothalamic lesion could cause neuroendocrine obesity. Hypothalamic obesity could be reproduced through ventromedial hypothalamic lesion in animals and attenuated that by subdiafragmatic vagotomy (VT). VT decreased food intake and insulinemia. Injection of monosodium glutamate (MSG) neonatally in rats produces adiposity, hyperphagia, without weight gain because it injures arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, site of growth hormone releasing hormone production. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the MSG effect on weight, stature, Lee index (3 square root body weight/nasoanal length), gonadal fat (GF) and food intake in rats and the VT effect on these parameters. Fifty-two male Wistar rats were used, divided into two groups of twenty-six animals each. SALINA group was subcutaneously injected with saline solution 12.5% (1.25 mg/g body weight/dayly/5days) and MSG group was injected with MSG solution 24% (4 mg/g body weight/dayly/5 days), after the rats were born, in the posterior cervical region without adverse reaction. On the 30th day of life, the animals were divided into four groups and submitted to operation, sham operated groups (LAPSAL and LAPMSG) and vagotomized groups (VTSAL and VTMSG). On operation day, weight, nasoanal length (NAL) and Lee index were obtained. Food intake were obtained from the 30th day until 90th day. On 90th day, the animals were sacrificed and weight, NAL, Lee index and GF were obtained. Statistic analysis was performed by the Students t test. NAL was smaller and Lee index was greater in MSG group than in SALINA group on the 30th day. Weight gain and NAL were smaller and Lee index and GF were greater on the 90th day, and food intake from the 30th to 90th day period was greater in LAPMSG group than in LAPSAL group. Weight gain, Lee index and GF were smaller and NAL trended smaller in VTMSG group than in LAPMSG group on the 90th day. Food intake from the 30th to 60th day period was smaller and trended greater from the 60th to 90th day period in VTMSG group than in LAPMSG. Vagal regeneration could explain that food intake inversion. These results suggest that MSG injected neonatally increases food intake and adiposity, and decreases stature and weight gain from the 30th to 90th day period. VT performed on the 30th day decreases food intake in first 30 days and decreases weight gain, Lee index and GF in MSG injected rats.","de Souza, Fernando; Batista Marchesini, João; Carlos L.

Older adults are known to experience loneliness, age discrimination, and excessive worry. It is therefore reasonable to anticipate that they would experience greater negative outcomes related to the COVID-19 pandemic given their increased isolation and risk for complications than younger adults. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to synthesize the existing research on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and associated isolation and protective measures, on older adults. The secondary objective is to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and associated isolation and protective measures, on older adults with Alzheimer disease and related dementias. METHODS: A rapid review of the published literature was conducted on October 6, 2020, through a search of 6 online databases to synthesize results from published original studies regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on older adults. The Human Development Model conceptual framework-Disability Creation Process was used to describe and understand interactions between personal factors, environmental factors, and life habits. Methods and results are reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses Statement. RESULTS: A total of 135 records were included from the initial search strategy of 13,452 individual studies. Of these, 113 (83.7%) studies were determined to be of level 4 according to the levels of evidence classification by the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine. The presence of psychological symptoms, exacerbation of ageism, and physical deterioration of aged populations were reported in the included studies. Decreased social life and fewer in-person social interactions reported during the COVID-19 pandemic were occasionally associated with reduced quality of life and increased depression. Difficulties accessing services, sleep disturbances, and a reduction of physical activity were also noted. CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the need for adequate isolation and protective measures. Older adults represent a heterogeneous group, which could explain the contradictory results found in the literature. Individual, organizational, and institutional strategies should be established to ensure that older adults are able to maintain social contacts, preserve family ties, and maintain the ability to give or receive help during the current pandemic. Future studies should focus on specific consequences and needs of more at-risk older adults to ensure their inclusion, both in public health recommendations and considerations made by policy makers.","Lebrasseur, Audrey; Fortin-Bédard, Noémie; Lettre, Josiane; Raymond, Emilie; Bussières, Eve-Line; Lapierre, Nolwenn; Faieta, Julie; Vincent, Claude; Duchesne, Louise; Ouellet, Marie-Christine; Gagnon, Eric; Tourigny, André; Lamontagne, Marie-Ève; Routhier, François",JMIR Aging,277,20

The authors first partitioned the census enumeration process into five operation phases. Within each phase, one or more activities considered to be critical to census data quality were identified. Operational data from each activity were then analyzed to assess the risk of error, particularly as they related to similar activities in the 2010 census. Overall, the evaluation found that census operations relied on higher risk activities at a higher rate in 2020 than in 2010, suggesting that the risk of error may be higher in 2020 than in 2010.

The early detection of infected individuals is a pre-requisite to contain the virus. Currently, purification of RNA from patient samples followed by RT-PCR is the gold standard to assess the presence of this single-strand RNA virus. However, these procedures are time consuming, require continuous supply of specialized reagents, and are prohibitively expensive in resource-poor settings. Here, we report an improved nucleic-acid-based approach to detect SARS-CoV-2 with the ability to detect as little as five viral genome equivalents. The approach delivers results without the need to purify RNA, reduces handling steps, minimizes costs, and allows evaluation by non-specialized equipment. The use of unprocessed swap samples is enabled by employing a heat-stable RNA- and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase, which performs the double task of stringent reverse transcription of RNA at elevated temperatures as well as PCR amplification of a SARS-CoV-2 specific target gene. As results are obtained within 2 hours and can be read-out by a hand-held LED-screen, this novel protocol will be of particular importance for large-scale virus surveillance in economically constrained settings.","Kuiper, Johannes W P; Baade, Timo; Kremer, Marcel; Kranaster, Ramon; Irmisch, Linda; Schuchmann, Marcus; Zander, Johannes; Marx, Andreas; Hauck, Christof R",PLoS One,277,22

This model is particularly suitable for identifying febrile and infectious diseases like COVID-19. Based on this model, features of cytokine storm and pathogenesis of COVID-19 have been proposed to be a consequence of the disequilibrated cytokine network resulting from increased biological activity of transforming growth factor-ß (TGF-ß), which induces certain clinical manifestations such as fatigue, fever, dry cough, pneumonia, abatement and losing of olfactory, and taste senses in some patients. Research and clarification of the pathogenesis of COVID-19 will contribute to precision treatment. Various anti-TGF-ß therapies may be explored as potential COVID-19 treatment.

The empirical evidence based on the connectedness methods of Diebold and Yilmaz (2012) and Baruník and Křehlík (2018) shows that the COVID-19 epidemic significantly increases the risk contagion effects in international stock markets. Besides, the risk spillovers from stock markets in European and American regions increase rapidly but those in Asian markets decrease obviously after the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, the risk contagion among international stock markets caused by the pandemic can last for about 6 to 8 months. These results provide important implications regarding to financial risk management and macroprudential design.","Liu, Yuntong Wei Yu Wang Qian Liu Yi",Finance Research Letters,277,26

Methods: We report a case of a 34-year-old with COVID-19 pneumonia receiving an IL-6 receptor antagonist (IL-6Ra) who developed spontaneous colonic perforation. This perforation occurred despite a benign abdominal exam and in the absence of other known risk factors associated with colonic perforation. Results: Examination of the colon by electron microscopy revealed numerous intact severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virions abutting the microvilli of the colonic mucosa. Multiplex immunofluorescent staining revealed the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein on the brush borders of colonic enterocytes that expressed angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. However, no viral particles were observed within the enterocytes to suggest direct viral injury as the cause of colonic perforation. Conclusions: These data and absence of known risk factors for spontaneous colonic perforation implicate IL-6Ra therapy as the potential mediator of colonic injury in this case. Furthermore, this report provides the first in situ visual evidence of the virus in the colon of a patient presenting with colonic perforation adding to growing evidence that intact infectious virus can be present in the stool.","Schwab, Kristin; Hamidi, Sepehr; Chung, Augustine; Lim, Raymond J; Khanlou, Negar; Hoesterey, Daniel; Dumitras, Camelia; Adeyiga, Oladunni B; Phan-Tang, Michelle; Wang, Tisha S; Saggar, Rajan; Goldstein, Jeffrey; Belperio, John A; Dubinett, Steven M; Kim, Jocelyn T; Salehi-Rad, Ramin",Open Forum Infect Dis,277,20

Public information created awareness as well as concern in the general population. There has been a reported decrease in the number of patients attending emergency departments (ED) during the pandemic. This is the first study to determine differences in the types of presenting illnesses, severity, and rate of resultant surgical intervention during the pandemic. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We carried out a retrospective, observational cohort study comparing two groups of patients attending the ED at our tertiary-care academic hospital. A historical comparison cohort was obtained by reviewing the number of patients referred by the ED for abdominal CT between March 15 and April 15, 2020, compared with March 15 and April 15, 2019. CT reports were reviewed; primary pathologies, complications, and subsequent surgical intervention were documented and compared between the two groups. RESULTS: In all, 733 patients were included in the 2019 cohort, and 422 patients were included in the 2020 cohort. In 2019, 32.7% had positive CT findings, increasing to 50.5% in 2020. The number of complications increased from 7.9% to 19.7%. The rate requiring surgical intervention increased from 26.3% to 47.6% in 2020. CONCLUSION: To date, there is little published data regarding the presentation and severity of illnesses during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. This information has important public health implications, highlighting the need to educate patients to continue to present to hospital services during such crises, including if a purported second wave of COVID-19 arises.","O039,; Brien, Ciara M; Jung, Katherine; Dang, Wilfred; Jang, Hyun-Jung; Kielar, Ania Z",J Am Coll Radiol,277,16

The serum IgA was tested with chemiluminescence method. Autoregressive moving average model was used to extrapolate the IgA levels before hospital admission. The positive rate of IgA and IgG in our cohort was 97% and 79.0%, respectively. In this study, the IgA levels peaks within 10-15 days after admission, while the IgG levels peaks at admission. We found that the time difference between their peaks was about 10 days. Viral RNA detection results showed that the positive rate in sputum and feces were the highest. Blood gas analysis showed that deterioration of hypoxia with the enlargement of pulmonary exudation area. And alveolar-arterial oxygen difference and oxygenation index were correlated with IgA and IgG. The results of biopsy showed that the epithelium of lung was exfoliated and the mucosa was edematous. In severe COVID-19 patients, the combination of IgA and IgG can predict the progress of pulmonary lesions and is closely related to hypoxemia and both also play an important defense role in invasion and destruction of bronchial and alveolar epithelium by SARS-CoV-2.","Xue, Mingshan; Zhang, Teng; Hu, Haisheng; Huang, Zhifeng; Zhen, Yingjie; Liang, Yueting; Zeng, Yifeng; Jin, Tengchuan; Zhou, Luqian; Zhang, Xiaohua D; Sun, Baoqing",J. med. virol,277,26

Many people are in psychological and existential despair for the loss of their jobs and the isolation that they are experiencing.

The study is examining approximately 11,875 youth from 21 sites from age 9 to 10 for approximately ten years into young adulthood. The ABCD Study® has completed recruitment for the baseline sample generally using a multi-stage probability sample including a stratified random sample of schools. The dataset has a wealth of measured attributes of youths and their environment, including neuroimaging, cognitive, biospecimen, behavioral, youth self-report and parent self-report metrics, and environmental measures. The initial goal of the ABCD Study was to examine risk and resiliency factors associated with the development of substance use, but the project has expanded far beyond this initial set of questions and will also greatly inform our understanding of the contributions of biospecimens (e.g., pubertal hormones), neural alterations, and environmental factors to the development of both healthy behavior and brain function as well as risk for poor mental and physical outcomes. This review outlines how the ABCD Study was designed to elucidate factors associated with the development of negative mental and physical health outcomes and will provide a selective overview of results emerging from the ABCD Study. Such emerging data includes initial validation of new instruments, important new information about the prevalence and correlates of mental health challenges in middle childhood, and promising data regarding neural correlates of both healthy and disordered behavior. In addition, we will discuss the challenges and opportunities to understanding both healthy development and the emergence of risk from ABCD Study data.

We aimed to compare the CFR and its predictors of COVID-19 and SARS patients using a territory-wide cohort in Hong Kong. METHODS: This was a territory-wide retrospective cohort study using data captured from all public hospitals in Hong Kong. Laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and SARS patients were identified. The primary endpoint was a composite endpoint of intensive care unit admission, use of mechanical ventilation, and/or death. RESULTS: We identified 1013 COVID-19 patients (mean age, 38.4 years; 53.9% male) diagnosed from 23 January to 14 April 2020 and 1670 SARS patients (mean age, 44.4 years; 44.0% male) from March to June 2003.

The objective of this study was to use an educational vignette to discuss issues of stigma around substance use and mental disorders within undergraduate Doctor of Medicine in Dentistry (DMD) and Bachelor of Dental Science in Dental Hygiene (BDSc-DH) students at the University of British Columbia, Canada. Our research question was “how can an educational vignette, depicting a fictitious patient with a history of substance use and mental health disorders accessing dental care, promote an open dialogue about stigma?” METHODS: An educational vignette was developed based on individuals’ lived-experiences with a variety of substance use and/or mental health disorders. This vignette was used to generate in-class discussion involving all the DMD and BDSc-DH undergraduate students enrolled between 2015/16 and 2018/19 who attended a mandatory 2.5 h didactic session using an inverted classroom approach. Students were also encouraged to provide a post-class voluntary written reflection, between 200 and 300 words, around stigma. The authors took written field notes on students’ response to the vignette and used excerpts from students’ de-identified reflections to illustrate the impact of such an educational tool. RESULTS: A total of 323 DMD and BDSc-DH students attended the didactic sessions between 2015/16 and 2018/19, and 148 reflections were submitted over the same time period. The inverted classroom approached showed to be engaging and collaborative. The vignette promoted open dialogue and was determined to be a conducive tool to generate in-class discussion and reflection. Major themes from the textual data included ‘exploring power relations’ and ‘patient-centered care approach to counteract stigma’. The vignette also enabled the discussion of positive experiences characterized by empathy, reassurance and communication, although it might not have prompted all students to participate in class or in writing the reflections. CONCLUSION: The inverted classroom approach and the vignette seemed to be an effective way to facilitate dialogue and reflection for most students. This study highlighted the need to explore innovative ways in which to continuously prepare current and future oral health care providers to professionally address the needs of patients with a history of substance use and/or mental health disorders.","Brondani, Mario; Alan, Rana; Donnelly, Leeann",BMC Med Educ,277,16

ARF has been shown to be frequently lost through CpG island promoter methylation in a wide spectrum of human malignancies, such as colorectal, prostate, breast, and gastric cancers, while point mutations and deletions in the p14ARF locus have been linked with various forms of melanomas and glioblastomas. Although ARF has been mostly studied in the context of tumorigenesis, it has been also implicated in purely developmental processes, such as spermatogenesis, and mammary gland and ocular development, while it has been additionally involved in the regulation of angiogenesis. Moreover, ARF has been found to hold important roles in stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. As is often the case with tumor suppressors, ARF functions as a pleiotropic protein regulating a number of different mechanisms at the crossroad of development and tumorigenesis. Here, we provide an overview of the non-canonical functions of ARF in cancer and developmental biology, by dissecting the crosstalk of ARF signaling with key oncogenic and developmental pathways.","Lagopati, Nefeli; Belogiannis, Konstantinos; Angelopoulou, Andriani; Papaspyropoulos, Angelos; Gorgoulis, Vassilis",Biomolecules,277,26

Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) is an endogenous fatty acid amide proposed to promote better sleep via potential interaction with the endocannabinoid system. METHODS: This double-blind, randomised study on 103 adults compared the efficacy and tolerability of 8 weeks of daily supplemented PEA formulation (350 mg Levagen + ®) to a placebo. Sleep quality and quantity were measured using wrist actigraphy, a sleep diary and questionnaires. RESULTS: At week 8, PEA supplementation reduced sleep onset latency, time to feel completely awake and improved cognition on waking. After 8 weeks, both groups improved their sleep quality and quantity scores similarly. There was no difference between groups at baseline or week 8 for sleep quantity or quality as measured from actigraphy or sleep diaries.

Objective Structured Teaching Exercises (OSTEs) are a simulation-based session we previously implemented in our in-person pediatric curriculum. We aimed to assess feasibility of and resident satisfaction with the transition to virtual learning for simulation-based OSTEs. METHODS: The pediatrics residency program at our hospital has a weekly academic half-day for residents where the OSTEs were held annually in person 2018 to 2019 and virtually in 2020. Surveys were collected from participating residents and faculty to compare teaching experience, feedback quality, and satisfaction with the session. RESULTS: Over 3 academic years, there were 159 total teaching sessions, 3 of which were OSTEs. The OSTE session was highly rated each year and was the second highest rated virtual session. Residents felt the OSTEs improved their teaching regardless of the virtual versus in-person platform (P = .77), and the quality of feedback as rated by the resident teacher was higher for virtual sessions (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Transitioning the OSTE to a virtual platform was both feasible and effective when compared to the in-person OSTE. In the transition to virtual learning, educators should consider opportunities for simulation-based teaching such as OSTEs.","Matthiesen, Madeleine I.; Hiserodt, Julia; Naureckas Li, Caitlin; Frey-Vogel, Ariel S.; Johnson, Jacob H.",Acad Pediatr,277,24

The purpose of this article is to describe the impact of clinical nurse specialist practice on COVID-19 preparation at a military hospital. ENVIRONMENT OF CARE CHANGES: The pandemic required facilities to develop expansion plans to facilitate a potential surge of COVID-19 patients. Clinical nurse specialists collaborated to develop a plan to expand care capacity and streamline testing while designating specific critical care and medical-surgical areas for COVID-19 patients. STAFFING CONSIDERATIONS: To capitalize on the expanded bed capacity, clinical nurse specialists identified and trained outpatient nursing staff to serve as nurse extenders. DISCUSSION: Early in the pandemic, a lack of strong evidence-based interventions to mitigate transmission and treatment necessitated the development of innovative solutions. The clinical nurse specialist team established designated transport routes for COVID-19 patients, leveraged technology to improve methods of care, and cultivated a culture of innovation by providing on-the-spot meaningful recognition to staff. CONCLUSION: As leaders in healthcare, clinical nurse specialists are change agents that work to maintain high-quality, safe patient care even during a global pandemic.","Lucciola, Megan E.; Nelson, Nicole M.; Rea, Jessica M.; Boudreaux, Allan J.; Fedderson, Daniel J.; Hodge, Nancy S.",Clin Nurse Spec,277,6

Currently, COVID‐19 vaccine rollouts are finally upon us carrying the hope of herd immunity once a sufficient proportion of the population has been vaccinated or infected, as a new horizon. However, the emergence of SARS‐CoV‐2 variants brought concerns since, as the virus is exposed to environmental selection pressures, it can mutate and evolve, generating variants that may possess enhanced virulence. Codon usage analysis is a strategy to elucidate the evolutionary pressure of the viral genome suffered by different hosts, as possible cause of the emergence of new variants. Therefore, to get a better picture of the SARS‐CoV‐2 codon bias, we first identified the relative codon usage rate of all Betacoronaviruses lineages. Subsequently, we correlated putative cognate transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNAs) to reveal how those viruses adapt to hosts in relation to their preferred codon usage. Our analysis revealed seven preferred codons located in three different open reading frame which appear preferentially used by SARS‐CoV‐2. In addition, the tRNA adaptation analysis indicates a wide strategy of competition between the virus and mammalian as principal hosts highlighting the importance to reinforce the genomic monitoring to prompt identify any potential adaptation of the virus into new potential hosts which appear to be crucial to prevent and mitigate the pandemic.","Lopes, Elisson N.; Fonseca, Vagner; Frias, Diego; Tosta, Stephane; Salgado, Álvaro; Assunção Vialle, Ricardo; Paulo Eduardo, Toscano S.; Barreto, Fernanda K.; Ariston de Azevedo, Vasco; Guarino, Michele; Angeletti, Silvia; Ciccozzi, Massimo; Junior Alcantara, Luiz C.; Giovanetti, Marta",J Med Virol,277,14

Methods: A cross-sectional study on pediatric emergency department consultations before and during the current COVID-19 pandemic (March–May 2019 vs. March–May 2020) was performed in two hospitals in the Campania region (Southern Italy) [i.e., Salerno University Hospital (Salerno) and Pediatric Regional Referral Emergency Hub “AORN Santobono-Pausillipon” (Naples)]. Results: 29,368 consecutive ED pediatric patients (13,430 females; mean age ± SD = 5.4 ± 4.7 years) were seen in March–May 2019 and 9,133 (4,494 females; mean age ± SD = 5.9 ± 4.2 years) in March–May 2020. Resuscitation/emergency and urgent care pediatric ED consultations were 1,388 (4.7%, 95% CI 4.5–4.9) in the 2019 trimester, while they were 648 (7.1%, 95% CI 6.6–7.6) in the 2020 trimester (p < 0.01). Mean pediatric ED daily consultations were 326.3 (95% CI 299.9–352.7) in the considered period of 2019 and 101.4 (95%CI 77.9–124.9) in the same period of 2020 (p < 0.001). COVID-19 nasal swabs were performed for 385 children; of those, six resulted positive and four of them were hospitalized. Conclusions: This work provides a unique snapshot of the pediatric EDs demands in the era of COVID-19. We witnessed a significant reduction of non-urgent health care demands during the pandemic but an increase of more severe urgent cases. The COVID-19 pandemic and the following lockdown unveiled the inappropriateness of the majority of pediatric ED consultations. Nevertheless, the current scenario highlighted the need for appropriate and timely clinical evaluations in the pediatric primary care to tackle late and more severe diagnoses in EDs.","Valitutti, Francesco; Zenzeri, Letizia; Mauro, Angela; Pacifico, Rosario; Borrelli, Micaela; Muzzica, Stefania; Boccia, Giovanni; Tipo, Vincenzo; Vajro, Pietro",Front Pediatr,277,24

Scalable, non-clinic-based strategies to control BP are needed. We therefore conducted a pilot trial of a text-messaging intervention in a national network of retail outlet health kiosks with BP devices. All study procedures were conducted remotely. METHODS Eligible individuals (N=140), based on average BP >140/90 mmHg at kiosks during the prior year, were randomized to intervention vs. usual care. Intervention consisted of tailored text messages providing educational information with embedded links to educational videos on topics related to BP control. BP measurements were obtained at kiosks at 3, 6, and 12 months following randomization; control was defined as BP <140/90 mmHg. Follow-up at 12 months was curtailed due to SARS-CoV-2. We therefore combined 12-month (N=62) or carried forward 6-month (N=61) data as the primary endpoint. RESULTS Participants were 51.4% male, 70.7% white/Caucasian, had mean age of 52.1 years, and mean baseline BP 145.5/91.8 mmHg. At the endpoint, 37.7% intervention vs. 27.4% usual care subjects achieved BP control (difference, 10.3%, 95% CI -6.2%, 26.8%). In an intention-to-treat analysis with multiple imputation of missing data, 12-month BP control was 29.0% vs. 19.8% favoring intervention (difference, 9.2%. 95% CI -7.3%, 25.7%); intervention vs. control differences in adjusted mean BP levels were SBP: -5.4 mmHg (95% CI: -13.5, 2.7) and DBP: +0.6 mmHg (95% CI: -4.2, 5.4).

The PHT at 700, 800, and 900 °C was conducted to modify the microstructure and mechanical properties of the composite. The results showed that the as-deposited composite had a weak flexural strength and plasticity due to the brittle nature of the eutectic phase. The eutectic phase consisted of M(7)C(3), M(2)C, and a small amount of the γ phase. However, after PHT at a certain temperature (e.g., 700 or 800 °C), the eutectic phase gradually disappeared, and carbides, such as M(7)C(3) and M(2)C, tended to be distributed uniformly in the γ matrix, which improved the flexural strength of the composite. Nevertheless, after the PHT at 900 °C, the flexural strength of the composite displayed a downward trend, which was mainly because of the severe softening of the γ phase. In addition, the plasticity of this composite continuously improved as the eutectic phase disappeared and the γ phase softened. Based on the above results, we proposed a PHT at 800 °C for 1 h as an optimal process for this WxC + Ni-based composite.","Chen, Chen; Du, Chengchao; Pan, Qiuhong; Chen, Qin",J Mater Eng Perform,277,20

However, a period of relative stagnation in leprosy control followed this achievement, and only limited further declines in the global number of new cases reported have been achieved over the past decade. MAIN TEXT: In 2016, major stakeholders called for the development of an innovative and comprehensive leprosy strategy aimed at reducing the incidence of leprosy, lowering the burden of disability and discrimination, and interrupting transmission. This led to the establishment of the Global Partnership for Zero Leprosy (GPZL) in 2018, with partners aligned around a shared Action Framework committed to achieving the WHO targets by 2030 through national leprosy program capacity-building, resource mobilisation and an enabling research agenda. GPZL convened over 140 experts from more than 20 countries to develop a research agenda to achieve zero leprosy. The result is a detailed research agenda focusing on diagnostics, mapping, digital technology and innovation, disability, epidemiological modelling and investment case, implementation research, stigma, post exposure prophylaxis and transmission, and vaccines. This research agenda is aligned with the research priorities identified by other stakeholders. CONCLUSIONS: Developing and achieving consensus on the research agenda for zero leprosy is a significant step forward for the leprosy community. In a next step, research programmes must be developed, with individual components of the research agenda requiring distinct expertise, varying in resource needs, and operating over different timescales. Moving toward zero leprosy now requires partner alignment and new investments at all stages of the research process, from discovery to implementation.","Steinmann, Peter; Dusenbury, Courtenay; Addiss, David; Mirza, Fareed; Smith, W.

However, barriers prevent non-epidemiologists from cultivating interests in epidemiology or undertaking epidemiologic work. In this study, we evaluated changes in the diversity of research topics in an epidemiologic journal over time. We aimed to understand how epidemiologists and non-epidemiologists communicate about epidemiologic data and how this impacts innovation in the field. Methods: We categorized the topics of articles published in the Journal of Epidemiology during the early and late 2010s based on their titles. We calculated the Shannon–Weaver diversity index (H′) to measure changes in the diversity of topics addressed by published articles. Results: Comparing 2011–2013 with 2017–2019, there was no significant change in the diversity of article topics (H′ = 4.25 and 4.21, respectively) published in the Journal of Epidemiology. Conclusion: To encourage healthcare providers and public administrators to conduct or comment on epidemiologic studies, epidemiologists should present their findings in easily understood language with appropriate and relevant statistical indicators and useful illustrations. Bringing experience from other specialties into epidemiology may yield new findings from epidemiologic data because of the exposure of non-epidemiologists to different values, workplaces, and occupations.

Recently, the usefulness of curdlan has been further explored by the pharmaceutical industry for its potential therapeutic applications. Curdlan has exhibited immunoregulatory and antitumor activity in preclinical settings. It was observed that curdlan can prevent the proliferation of malarial merozoites in vivo; therefore, it may be considered as a promising therapy for the treatment of end-stage malaria. In addition, curdlan has demonstrated potent antiviral effects against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Aedes aegypti virus. It has been suggested that the virucidal properties of curdlans should be extended further for other deadly viruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and the current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19). The prebiotic property of curdlan would confer beneficial effects on the host by promoting the growth of healthy microbiota in the gut and consequently help to reduce gastrointestinal disorders. Therefore, curdlan can be employed in the manufacture of prebiotics for the management of various gastrointestinal dysbiosis problems. Studies on the mechanism of action of curdlan-induced suppression in microbial and tumor cells at the cellular and molecular levels would not only enhance our understanding regarding the therapeutic effectiveness of curdlan but also help in the discovery of new drugs and dietary supplements.

Sequence analysis revealed that the 41 ORF3 genes and 29 S1 genes identified in our study exhibited nucleotide homologies of 98.2%–100% and 96.6%–100%, respectively; these two genes exhibited low nucleotide sequence similarities with classical CV777 strain and early Chinese strain LZC. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the identified PEDV strains belonged to global non S-INDEL strains, and exhibited genetic diversity; S1 gene of the HLJ2015/DP1-1 strain harbored an unique deletion of 12 nucleotides (A(1130)CAACTCCACTG(1141)); while the Chinese PEDV S-INDEL reference strains included two types of the “CV777” S-INDEL as well as the “US” S-INDEL, and all co-circulated with Chinese non S-INDEL strains. Of 29 identified S1 genes, the SS2 epitope (Y(748)SNIGVCK(755)) was highly conserved, while the SS6 epitope (L(764)QDGQVKI(771)) and pAPN receptor-binding region (aa 490–615) exhibited amino substitutions.

Information technology (IT) and electronic immunization can be effective in accelerating and improving vaccine coverage. The aim of this paper is to develop multi-dimensional framework of e-health roadmap to response Covod-19 pandemic and examine the role of IT for improving vaccine distribution in Iran. METHODS: The study methodology was based on a two-stage Delphi method which included literature studies at the beginning. Key steps in creating a roadmap in this study include definition, development and evaluation. The initial conceptual model was developed after literature review. Proposed roadmap was reviewed and evaluated in two stages based on the Delphi method by experts in the fields of E-health. RESULTS: In the e-health roadmap model, 14 stages of vaccine distribution were presented in three phases of vaccination and then were determined the type of technology in each phase. The 4 conceptual models were approved based on the two stages Delphi approach in a survey of 14 e-health experts.

We aimed at analyzing if and how does the pandemic affect sleep and related behaviors. METHODS: We reviewed 48,047 nights recorded in the US with the Sleeprate application by 3,381 users during a period of 2 years, December 2018-November 2020. Nightly data included perceived and measured sleep parameters. In addition, users reported their perceived daytime stress and sleepiness. We analyzed the monthly variability of the studied parameters and compared their values during the COVID-19 period of March-November 2020 (CP) with those in the previous corresponding period in 2019, the pre-COVID-19 period (PCP). RESULTS: Starting March 2020, wake-up time (WUT) was significantly delayed relative to PCP. WUT in April 2020 was the latest (8:06AM±2:12hours, mean±SD, p<.000), being an hour later than in April 2019. This delay started to diminish in June 2020, reaching 7:27AM±2:10 hours by November 2020, which was not significantly higher than during PCP. Bedtime (BT) exhibited similar behavior, yet it returned to PCP times faster. Delayed BT and WUT on weekends were observed during CP as well as PCP. No consistent differences in sleep duration or sleep efficiency were detected between CP and PCP. Subjective sleep satisfaction was higher in CP relative to PCP. However, daytime sleepiness and daytime stress were also higher during most of CP compared to PCP. CONCLUSION: Our data, based on digital in-app sleep diaries coupled with perceived sleep parameters, demonstrate the pandemic’s effects on sleep behavior in the US. Users in this study adapted to the new circumstances with delayed sleep schedule, while not reducing the sleep opportunity. The higher sleep satisfaction may be connected to later sleep schedules, allowing a wake-up time that fits better human biological clocks. The reported increased stress and sleepiness further portray the uncertainty and turbulence characterizing the pandemic’s effects on populations life during the pandemic. As good sleep is linked with immune response efficacy, higher quality of life, and improved mood, the importance of sleep must not be overlooked, especially during the pandemic.

To compare the virological and clinical responses to lopinavir-ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine treatment in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included patients with COVID-19 treated with lopinavir-ritonavir or hydroxychloroquine at a single center in Korea from February 17 to March 31, 2020. Patients treated with lopinavir-ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine concurrently and those treated with lopinavir-ritonavir or hydroxychloroquine for less than 7 days were excluded. Time to negative conversion of viral RNA, time to clinical improvement, and safety outcomes were assessed after 6 weeks of follow-up. RESULTS: Of 65 patients (mean age, 64.3 years; 25 men [38.5%]), 31 were treated with lopinavir-ritonavir and 34 were treated with hydroxychloroquine. The median duration of symptoms before treatment was 7 days and 26 patients (40%) required oxygen support at baseline. Patients treated with lopinavir-ritonavir had a significantly shorter time to negative conversion of viral RNA than those treated with hydroxychloroquine (median, 21 days vs. 28 days). Treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 2.28; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.24 to 4.21) and younger age (aHR, 2.64; 95% CI 1.43 to 4.87) was associated with negative conversion of viral RNA. There was no significant difference in time to clinical improvement between lopinavir-ritonavir- and hydroxychloroquine-treated patients (median, 18 days vs. 21 days). Lymphopenia and hyperbilirubinemia were more frequent in lopinavir-ritonavir-treated patients compared with hydroxychloroquine-treated patients. CONCLUSIONS: Lopinavir-ritonavir was associated with more rapid viral clearance than hydroxychloroquine in mild to moderate COVID-19, despite comparable clinical responses. These findings should be confirmed in randomized, controlled trials.","Kim, Ji-Won; Kim, Eun Jin; Kwon, Hyun Hee; Jung, Chi Young; Kim, Kyung Chan; Choe, Jung-Yoon; Hong, Hyo-Lim",Korean J Intern Med,277,20

Popular discontent with the health system has led to major reforms. To help inform these reforms, we did a comprehensive assessment of disease burden in China, how it changed between 1990 and 2010, and how China's health burden compares with other nations. METHODS: We used results of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2010 (GBD 2010) for 1990 and 2010 for China and 18 other countries in the G20 to assess rates and trends in mortality, causes of death, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), and healthy life expectancy (HALE). We present results for 231 diseases and injuries and for 67 risk factors or clusters of risk factors relevant to China. We assessed relative performance of China against G20 countries (significantly better, worse, or indistinguishable from the G20 mean) with age-standardised rates and 95% uncertainty intervals. FINDINGS: The leading causes of death in China in 2010 were stroke (1·7 million deaths, 95% UI 1·5–1·8 million), ischaemic heart disease (948 700 deaths, 774 500–1 024 600), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (934 000 deaths, 846 600–1 032 300). Age-standardised YLLs in China were lower in 2010 than all emerging economies in the G20, and only slightly higher than noted in the USA. China had the lowest age-standardised YLD rate in the G20 in 2010. China also ranked tenth (95% UI eighth to tenth) for HALE and 12th (11th to 13th) for life expectancy. YLLs from neonatal causes, infectious diseases, and injuries in children declined substantially between 1990 and 2010. Mental and behavioural disorders, substance use disorders, and musculoskeletal disorders were responsible for almost half of all YLDs. The fraction of DALYs from YLDs rose from 28·1% (95% UI 24·2–32·5) in 1990 to 39·4% (34·9–43·8) in 2010. Leading causes of DALYs in 2010 were cardiovascular diseases (stroke and ischaemic heart disease), cancers (lung and liver cancer), low back pain, and depression. Dietary risk factors, high blood pressure, and tobacco exposure are the risk factors that constituted the largest number of attributable DALYs in China. Ambient air pollution ranked fourth (third to fifth; the second highest in the G20) and household air pollution ranked fifth (fourth to sixth; the third highest in the G20) in terms of the age-standardised DALY rate in 2010. INTERPRETATION: The rapid rise of non-communicable diseases driven by urbanisation, rising incomes, and ageing poses major challenges for China's health system, as does a shift to chronic disability. Reduction of population exposures from poor diet, high blood pressure, tobacco use, cholesterol, and fasting blood glucose are public policy priorities for China, as are the control of ambient and household air pollution. These changes will require an integrated government response to improve primary care and undertake required multisectoral action to tackle key risks. Analyses of disease burden provide a useful framework to guide policy responses to the changing disease spectrum in China.

Pregnant and postpartum people are a particularly vulnerable subgroup to consider when studying healthcare access. Not only are perinatal people likely at higher risk for illness, mortality, and morbidity from COVID-19 infection, they are also at higher risk for negative outcomes due to delayed or inadequate access to routine care. METHODS: We surveyed 820 pregnant people in California over two waves of the COVID-19 pandemic: (1) a ‘non-surge’ wave (June 2020, n = 433), and (2) during a ‘surge’ in cases (December 2020, n = 387) to describe current access to perinatal healthcare, as well as concerns and decision-making regarding childbirth, over time. We also examined whether existing structural vulnerabilities – including acute financial insecurity and racial/ethnic minoritization – are associated with access, concerns, and decision-making over these two waves. RESULTS: Pregnant Californians generally enjoyed more access to, and fewer concerns about, perinatal healthcare during the winter of 2020–2021, despite surging COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations, as compared to those surveyed during the COVID-19 ‘lull’ in the summer of 2020. However, across ‘surge’ and ‘non-surge’ pandemic circumstances, marginalized pregnant people continued to fare worse – especially those facing acute financial difficulty, and racially minoritized individuals identifying as Black or Indigenous. CONCLUSIONS: It is important for clinicians, researchers, and policymakers to understand whether and how shifting community transmission and infection rates may impact access to perinatal healthcare. Targeting minoritized and financially insecure communities for increased upstream perinatal healthcare supports are promising avenues to blunt the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on pregnant people in California.

Although an experimental vaccine has successfully protected non-human primates against disease(1), more than six months was required to complete the immunizations, making it impractical to limit an acute epidemic. Here, we report the development of accelerated vaccination against Ebola virus in non-human primates. The antibody response to immunization with an adenoviral (ADV) vector encoding the Ebola glycoprotein (GP) was induced more rapidly than with DNA priming and ADV boosting, but it was of lower magnitude. To determine whether this earlier immune response could nonetheless protect against disease, cynomolgus macaques were challenged with Ebola virus after vaccination with ADV–GP and nucleoprotein (NP) vectors. Protection was highly effective and correlated with the generation of Ebola-specific CD8(+) T-cell and antibody responses. Even when animals were immunized once with ADV–GP/NP and challenged 28 days later, they remained resistant to challenge with either low or high doses of virus. This accelerated vaccine provides an intervention that may help to limit the epidemic spread of Ebola, and is applicable to other viruses.

The initial treatment is conservative, but if the symptoms persist, necrosis and distal amputation can occur. In selected patients, neuromodulation with spinal cord stimulation (SCS) can be an effective treatment by reducing pain and amputation rate. Recent evidence suggests that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can cause endotheliopathy with microvascular and macrovascular thrombotic events and can present as a systemic inflammatory vascular disease.

METHODS: We used pseudonymised data on 902 813 individuals employed by 191 National Health Service trusts to explore demographic and occupational risk factors for sickness absence ascribed to COVID-19 (n=92 880). We estimated ORs by multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: With adjustment for employing trust, demographic characteristics and previous frequency of sickness absence, risk relative to administrative/clerical occupations was highest in ‘additional clinical services’ (care assistants and other occupations directly supporting those in clinical roles) (OR 2.31 (2.25 to 2.37)), registered nursing and midwifery professionals (OR 2.28 (2.23 to 2.34)) and allied health professionals (OR 1.94 (1.88 to 2.01)) and intermediate in doctors and dentists (OR 1.55 (1.50 to 1.61)). Differences in risk were higher after the employing trust had started to care for documented patients with COVID-19, and were reduced, but not eliminated, following additional adjustment for exposure to infected patients or materials, assessed by a job-exposure matrix. For prolonged COVID-19 sickness absence (episodes lasting >14 days), the variation in risk by staff group was somewhat greater. CONCLUSIONS: After allowance for possible bias and confounding by non-occupational exposures, we estimated that relative risks for COVID-19 among most patient-facing occupations were between 1.5 and 2.5. The highest risks were in those working in additional clinical services, nursing and midwifery and in allied health professions. Better protective measures for these staff groups should be a priority. COVID-19 may meet criteria for compensation as an occupational disease in some healthcare occupations.

Although kidney transplant recipients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have higher mortality than the general population, data on their risk of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are unknown. SUBJECT OF REVIEW: A recent single-center screening study from the UK (Transplantation. 2021 Jan 1;105(1):151–7) showed that 89 (10.4%) of 855 consecutive kidney transplant recipients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Risk factors for infection included a nonwhite background, diabetes, and a history of allograft rejection. Risk factors for mortality in individuals who developed COVID-19 were older age and receiving steroids. SECOND OPINION: This study shows that the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in kidney transplant recipients is similar to the one observed in the general population in the same area (13%), indicating that transplant recipients are not at increased risk of COVID-19. However, the investigators raise the interesting point that since transplant individuals were advised to shelter earlier than the general population, they may be in fact more susceptible. This statement is hard to substantiate, but the identification of specific risk factors for infection and poor outcomes is crucial to tailor strategies to prevent spread of the infection.

Planning for a return to normality or the new normal is a complex, multi-agency task for which healthcare scientists may not be prepared. This paper introduces a widely used military planning framework known as the Joint Military Appreciation Process, and outlines how it can be applied to deal with the next phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Recognition of SARS-CoV-2's critical attributes, targetable vulnerabilities, and its most likely and most dangerous effects is a necessary precursor to scoping, framing and mission analysis. From this flows course of action development, analysis, concept of operations development, and an eventual decision to act on the plan. The same planning technique is applicable to the larger scale task of setting a microbiology-centric plan in the broader context of social and economic recovery.","Inglis, Timothy J.

This case-series study was conducted at Phoebe Putney Health System. Participants were confirmed Covid-19 patients admitted to our health system between March 2, 2020 and June 7, 2020. Data were collected from electronic medical records. Patients were divided into 2 groups: with and without elevated cTnI. The cTnI were further divided in 4 tertiles. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to adjust for demographics, baseline comorbidities, and laboratory parameters including D-dimer, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, procalcitonin and C-reactive protein. Out of 309 patients, 116 (37.5%) had elevated cTnI. Those with elevated cTnI were older (59.9 vs. 68.2 years, p<0.001), and more likely to be males (53.5% vs. 36.3%, p=0.003). Elevated cTnI group had higher baseline comorbidities. After multivariable adjustment, overall mortality was significantly higher in elevated cTnI group (37.9% v 11.4%, odds ratio:4.45; confidence interval:1.78-11.14, p<0.001). Need for intubation, dialysis, and intensive care unit (ICU) transfer was higher in elevated cTnI group. Among those with elevated cTnI, mortality was 23.2% for 50(th) percentile, 48.4% for 75(th) percentile, and 55.2% for 100(th) percentile. Similarly, further increase in cTnI was associated with a higher need for intubation, dialysis, and ICU transfer. In conclusion, myocardial injury occurs in significant proportion of hospitalized Covid-19 patients and is an independent predictor of clinical outcomes, with higher values associated with worse outcomes.","Shah, Priyank; Doshi, Rajkumar; Chenna, Avantika; Owens, Robin; Cobb, Abigail; Ivey, Holley; Newton, Sarah; Mccarley, Kelly",Am J Cardiol,277,30

METHODS: : We report three representative case-scenarios on patients with psychiatric disorders and COVID-19 to provide a practical approach based on the existing literature and the clinical experience of an expert team in consultation-liaison psychiatry. CASE-CENTERED RECOMMENDATIONS: : Psychopharmacological ongoing treatments should be prioritized and most doses should be reduced 25–50% of original dose if the patient receives lopinavir/ritonavir, with some exceptions including quetiapine, asenapine, olanzapine, sertraline, lamotrigine, bupropion, and methadone. If the psychopharmacological usual doses are in the low-to-median range levels, a dose change during COVID-19 drugs co-administration is not recommended, but only ECG and clinical monitoring of adverse effects and drug levels if required. Furthermore, when introducing a psychopharmacological drug, dose titration should be progressive, with ECG monitoring if cardiotoxic interactions are present. (A) In agitated delirium, olanzapine is recommended as first-line antipsychotic and quetiapine should be avoided. (B) In severe mental illness (SMI), essential treatments should be maintained. (C) In non-SMI with depressive/anxiety symptoms, psychological support should be provided and symptoms identified and treated. LIMITATIONS: : Most recommendations on pharmacological interactions provide only a limited qualitative approach and quantitative recommendations are lacking. CONCLUSIONS: : Patients with psychiatric disorders and COVID-19 should be managed on a personalized basis considering several clinical criteria and, should not be excluded from receiving COVID-19 treatments. Risks of pharmacological interaction are not absolute and should be contextualized, and most psychopharmacological treatments should include an ECG with special attention to QTc interval.","Anmella, G.; Arbelo, N.; Fico, G.; Murru, A.; Llach, C.D.; Madero, S.; Gomes-da-Costa, S.; Imaz, M.L.; López-Pelayo, H.; Vieta, E.; Pintor, L.",J Affect Disord,277,15

However, the obscurity of this syndrome remains a hurdle in making decisive treatment choices. Therefore, an attempt to characterize shared biological mechanisms between ARDS and thrombosis using comprehensive transcriptomics meta-analysis is made. We conducted an integrated gene expression meta-analysis of two independently publicly available datasets of ARDS and venous thromboembolism (VTE). Datasets GSE76293 and GSE19151 derived from National Centre for Biotechnology Information–Gene Expression Omnibus (NCBI-GEO) database were used for ARDS and VTE, respectively.

Engineered RBCs expressing CD4 and CCR5 were efficiently infected by HIV-1, but CD4 or CD4-GpA expression in the absence of CCR5 was sufficient to potently neutralize HIV-1 in vitro. To facilitate continuous large-scale production of engineered RBCs, we generated erythroblast cell lines stably expressing CD4-GpA or ACE2-GpA fusion proteins, which produced potent RBC viral traps against HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2.

The amount of epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) may have relevant implications given its proximity to the heart and lungs. Here, we explored the role of EAT in increasing the risk for COVID-19 adverse outcomes. METHODS: We included 748 patients with COVID-19 attending a reference centre in Mexico City. EAT thickness, sub-thoracic and pericardial fat were measured using thoracic CT scans. We explored the association of each thoracic adipose tissue compartment with critical COVID-19 and mortality according to the presence or absence of obesity. Mediation analyses evaluated the role of EAT in facilitating the effect of age, body mass index and cardiac troponin levels with adverse COVID-19 outcomes. RESULTS: EAT thickness was associated with increased risk of COVID-19 mortality (HR 1.18, 95%CI 1.01-1.39) independent of age, gender, comorbid conditions and BMI. Increased EAT was associated with lower SpO2 and PaFi index and higher levels of cardiac troponins, D-dimer, C-reactive protein, and 4C severity score, independent of obesity. EAT mediated 13.1% (95%CI 3.67-28.0%) and 5.1% (95%CI 0.19-14.0%) of the effect of age and 19.4% (95%CI 4.67-63.0%) and 12.8% (95%CI 0.03-46.0%) of the effect of BMI on requirement for intubation and mortality, respectively. EAT also mediated the effect of increased cardiac troponins on myocardial infarction during COVID-19. CONCLUSION: EAT is an independent risk factor for severe COVID-19 and mortality independent of obesity. EAT partly mediates the effect of age and BMI and increased cardiac troponins on adverse COVID-19 outcomes.","Mehta, R.; Bello-Chavolla, O.

The current study seeks to elucidate the mechanisms involved in summoning macrophages to the cochlear lateral wall and the role macrophages play in noise-induced injury or repair. CCL2 and its primary receptor, CCR2, are the most widely validated effectors of monocyte chemotaxis in vivo. CCL2(−/−) and CCR2(−/−) mice have been used extensively in studies of monocyte activation in neuronal injury. However, the function of CCL2 and CCR2 in the cochlea has not been studied. The present study examines the role of CCL2 and CCR2 in acoustic injury. CCL2(−/−) and CCR2(−/−) mice on a CX3CR1(+/GFP) background were exposed to octave band noise (8–16 kHz) for 2 h to determine the effect of CCL2 and CCR2 on monocyte migration into the cochlea, threshold shift, and cell survival. We found that threshold shift was unchanged in the two knockout mouse strains when compared to the background strain (CX3CR1(+/GFP)). Surprisingly, we found that monocyte migration was also unchanged, despite the absence of CCL2 or CCR2. However, there was a dramatic increase in noise-induced hair cell death in the CCR2(−/−) strain. This observation suggests that CCR2, independent of CCL2, plays a protective role in the cochlea after noise, and neither ligand nor receptor is necessary for monocyte migration. Possible mechanisms of neuroprotection by CCR2 are discussed.","Sautter, Nathan B.; Shick, Elizabeth H.; Ransohoff, Richard M.; Charo, Israel F.; Hirose, Keiko",Journal of the Association for Research in Otolaryngology,277,5

Clinical information, laboratory examinations, immunological function, and treatment outcomes were retrospectively analyzed. Our study revealed that severe COVID-19 patients with comorbidities had higher levels of inflammatory indices, including blood interferon-γ, interleukin (IL)-6 and c-reactive protein levels as well as the erythrocyte sedimentation rate. These were accompanied by lymphopenia, hypokalemia, hypoalbuminemia, a decrease in either CD4+ T cells or lymphocyte count, and coagulation disorders, which were closely related to poor prognosis. Patients with comorbidities also had longer disease remission times (27 ± 6.7 days) than those without comorbidities (20 ± 6.5 days). Cox multivariate analysis indicated that glucocorticoid therapy and IL-6 were independent prognostic factors. Our findings suggest that coexisting comorbidities aggravate COVID-19 through the excessive release of inflammatory factors and that glucocorticoid therapy may be beneficial.","Han, Dan; Peng, Chunfen; Meng, Rui; Yao, Jing; Zhou, Qiong; Xiao, Yong; Ma, Hong",Aging (Albany NY),277,26

Subjects: We set the lung model with three conditions of resistance and linear compliance for mimicking different respiratory mechanics of representative intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Interventions: The performance of the device was tested using the ASL5000 lung model. Measurements and Main Results: Twenty-seven conditions were tested. All the measurements fell within the ±10% limits for the tidal volume (V(T)). The volume error was influenced by the mechanical condition (p = 5.9 × 10(−15)) and the PEEP level (P = 1.1 × 10(−12)) but the clinical significance of this finding is likely meaningless (maximum −34 mL in the error). The PEEP error was not influenced by the mechanical condition (p = 0.25).

Results: 92/211 (43.6%) samples were positive for BAstV, at a rate of 46.10% (71/154) in cattle and 36.84% (21/57) in water buffalo. Phylogenetic analysis based on the partial and full-length of 25 ORF2 amino acid sequences obtained in this study classified the Guangxi BAstVs isolates into five subgroups under the genus of Mamastrovirus, genotype MAstV33, which suggested that the water buffalo was a new host of this genogroup that previously included only cattle and roe deer. Despite the origin of the host, the Guangxi BAstV isolates were closely related to the BAstV Hong Kong isolates (B18/HK and B76-2/HK), but highly divergent from the BAstV NeuroS1 isolate previously associated with neurologic disease in cattle in the U.S.A. Nucleotide sequence-based characterization of the ORF1b/ORF2 junction and corresponding overlapping regions showed distinctive properties, which may be common to BAstVs. Our results suggested that cattle and water buffalo are prone to infection of closely related astroviruses, which probably evolved from the same ancestor. The current study described astroviruses in water buffalo for the first time and is thus far among the largest epidemiological investigations of BAstV infection in cattle conducted in China.","ALFRED, Niyokwishimira; LIU, Huan; LI, Mu Lan; HONG, Shao Feng; TANG, Hai Bo; WEI, Zu Zhang; CHEN, Ying; LI, Fa Kai; ZHONG, Yi Zhi; HUANG, Wei Jian",J Vet Med Sci,277,16

BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has resulted in unprecedented challenges to workplace safety and health for workers and managers in essential businesses, including healthcare workers, grocery stores, delivery services, warehouses, and distribution centers. Essential workers need protection, accurate information, and a supportive work environment with an unwavering focus on effective infection control. METHOD: The investigators reviewed emerging workplace recommendations for reducing workers’ exposures to the novel coronavirus and the challenges to workers in protecting their health. Using a theoretical framework and guidelines for integrating safety and health management systems into an organization for TWH, the investigators adapted the framework’s key characteristics to meet the specific worker safety and health issues for effective infection control, providing supports for increasing psychological demands while ensuring a safe work environment. RESULTS: The recommended approach includes six key characteristics: focusing on working conditions for infection control and supportive environments for increased psychological demands; utilizing participatory approaches involving workers in identifying daily challenges and unique solutions; employing comprehensive and collaborative efforts to increase system efficiencies; committing as leaders to supporting workers through action and communications; adhering to ethical and legal standards; and using data to guide actions and evaluate progress. CONCLUSION: Applying an integrative TWH approach for worker safety, health, and well-being provides a framework to help managers systematically organize and protect themselves, essential workers, and the public during the COVID-19 pandemic. APPLICATION: By using the systems approach provided by the six implementation characteristics, employers of essential workers can organize their own efforts to improve system performance and worker well-being during these unprecedented times.","Dennerlein, Jack T.; Burke, Lisa; Sabbath, Erika L.; Williams, Jessica A.

Only three cases in Bangladesh were reported on March 8, 2020. Here, we aim to predict the epidemic progression for 1 year under different scenarios in Bangladesh. We extracted the number of daily confirmed cases from March 8 to July 20, 2020. We considered the suspected-infected-removed (SIR) model and performed a maximum likelihood-based grid search to determine the removal rate (ɣ). The transmission was modeled as a stochastic random walk process, and sequential Monte Carlo simulation was run 100 times with bootstrap fits to infer the transmission rate (β) and R(t). According to the simulation, the (real) peak daily incidence of 3,600 would be followed by a steady decline, reaching below 1,000 in late January 2021. Thus, the model predicted that there would still be more than 300 cases/day even after a year. However, with proper interventions, a much steeper decline would be achieved following the peak. If we apply a combined (0.8β, 1.2ɣ) intervention, there would be less than 100 cases by mid-October, only around five odd cases at the beginning of the year 2021, and zero cases in early March 2021. The predicted total number of deaths (in status quo) after 1 year would be 8,533 which would reduce to 3,577 if combined (0.8β, 1.2ɣ) intervention is applied. We have also predicted the ideal number of tests that Bangladesh should perform and based on that redid the whole simulation. The outcome, though worse, would be manageable with interventions according to the simulation.","Khan, Irtesam Mahmud; Haque, Ubydul; Kaisar, Samiha; Rahman, Mohammad Sohel",Am J Trop Med Hyg,277,21

Firstly, viruses appear to be polyphyletic in origin, with several sets of viruses arising by different, independent routes at different times. Secondly, subsequent virus adaptation for survival in different host/vector combinations has involved the selective acquisition of additional genes by a process of cassette or modular evolution, with these additional gene modules coming from other viruses or host genetic material. Thus, depending on the gene product used for comparison, different phylogenetic relationships can be deduced. Further virus adaptation can arise by reassortment of segmented genomes, gene duplication, deletions, frameshift mutations, point mutations or de novo development of new gene products from existing, unused reading frames. The solution to the first objection is to place all viruses in a separate kingdom and assign the current viruses to several phyla that reflect these diverse origins. The solution to the second objection is to consider the core module of replication machinery as the major criterion on which to make the initial assignments to classes and orders. For RNA viruses, the major criterion is the sequence identity of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Using this criterion, the positive strand RNA viruses can be assigned to five classes that correspond to the recently recognized supergroups of RNA viruses. These five classes contain four, three, three, three and one order(s) respectively. These fourteen orders contain 31 virus families (including 17 families of plant viruses) and 48 genera (including 30 genera of plant viruses). This approach confirms the separation of the alphaviruses and flaviviruses into two families, the Togaviridae and Flaviridae, but suggests that several other current taxonomic assignments, such as the pestiviruses, hepatitis C virus, rubiviruses, hepatitis E virus and arteriviruses, may be wrong. The coronaviruses and toroviruses appear to be distinct families in distinct orders, not distinct genera of the same family as currently classified. In addition, the luteoviruses are split into two families and apple chlorotic leaf spot virus appears not to be a closterovirus but a new genus of the Potexviridae. From an analysis of the polymerase dendrograms of the dsRNA viruses, it appears that they are not closely related to each other, but belong to four additional classes (Partitiviridae, Reoviridae, Birnaviridae and Cystoviridae) and one additional order (Totiviridae) of one of the classes of positive ssRNA viruses in the same subphylum as the positive strand RNA viruses. The negative strand virus polymerase relationships confirm the assignment of the negative strand viruses to two orders in a single class in a separate subphylum of the RNA viruses. This review includes preliminary data suggesting that the DNA viruses can also be assigned to higher taxa on the basis of the sequence identities of their highly conserved DNA polymerases. The suggested use of viral polymerases to establish higher order relationships is similar in principle to the use of highly conserved ribosomal RNA gene sequences in prokaryotic and eukaryotic taxonomy. This review also discusses the assignment of 33 of the 35 groups of plant viruses into genera of 25 families based on the nature of the genome and its arrangement, the level of sequence identity and, to a lesser extent, particle morphology.","Ward, C.

Methods From the database of the diabetes units of Piedmont-Italy we extracted records of T2DM patients, which were linked with the swab-testing-database, and the database of hospital discharges. Five outcomes (PCR testing, PCR testing positivity, hospitalization, Intensive Care Unit (ICU), death) were evaluated using robust Poisson models. Results Among 125,021 T2DM patients, 1,882 had a positive PCR test. Of these patients, 49.4% were hospitalized within 30 days, 11.8% were admitted to an ICU, and 27.1% died. Greater probability of death was associated with age, male sex, liver and renal impairment, Hba1c above 8%, and former smoking. Hospitalization and ICU admission were mainly affected by age, male sex, hypertension, and metabolic control. Notably, ICU admissions were reduced in very elderly people. No outcomes were associated with educational level. Conclusions Hospitalization and ICU admission are heavily affected by age and local triage policy.

Here, a novel strategy for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 variants using multiplex PCR coupled with MALDI-TOF MS was developed. Methods Plasmids carrying gene sequences containing 9 mutation types in 7 mutated sites (HV6970del, N501Y, K417N, P681H, D614G, E484K, L452R, E484Q and P681R) in the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 variants were synthesized. Using the nucleic acid sequence of SARS-CoV-2 nonvariant and a synthetic SARS-CoV-2 variant-carrying plasmid, a MALDI-TOF MS method based on the single-base mass probe extension of multiplex PCR amplification products was established to detect the above nine mutation types. The detection limit of this method was determined via the concentration gradient method. Twenty-one respiratory tract pathogens (9 bacteria, 11 respiratory viruses) and pharyngeal swab nucleic acid samples from healthy people were selected for specific validation. Sixteen samples from COVID-19 patients were used to verify the accuracy of this method. Results The 9 mutation types could be detected simultaneously by triple PCR amplification coupled with MALDI-TOF MS. SARS-CoV-2 and all six variants (B.1.1.7, B.1.351, B.1.429, B.1.526, P.1 and B.1.617) could be identified. The detection limit for all 9 sites was 1560 copies. The specificity of this method was 100%, and the accuracy of real-time PCR CT values less than 30 among positive samples was 100%. This method is open and extensible, and can be used in a high-throughput manner, easily allowing the addition of new mutation sites as needed to identify and track new SARS-CoV-2 variants as they emerge. Conclusions Multiplex PCR-MALDI-TOF MS provides a new detection option with practical application value for SARS-CoV-2 and its variant infection.","Zhao, F.; Zhang, J.; Wang, X.; Hou, X.; Qin, T.; Meng, F.; Xu, X.; Li, T.; Zhou, H.; Kan, B.; Lu, J.; Xiao, D.",,277,3

We estimate the premature mortality productivity costs associated with COVID-19 across Europe. METHODS: We calculated excess deaths between the date the cumulative total of COVID-19 deaths reached 10 in a country to 15th May 2020 for nine countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland). Gender- and age-specific excess deaths and Years of Potential Productive Life Lost (YPPLL) between 30 and 74 years were calculated and converted into premature mortality productivity costs €2020 for paid and unpaid work using the Human Capital and the Proxy Good Approaches. Costs were discounted at 3.5%. RESULTS: Total estimated excess deaths across the nine countries were 18,614 (77% in men) and YPPLL were 134,190 (77% male). Total paid premature mortality costs were €1.07 billion (87% male) with Spain (€0.35 billion, 33.0% of total), Italy (€0.22 billion; 20.6%) and The Netherlands (€0.19 billion; 17.5%) ranking highest. Total paid and unpaid premature mortality costs were €2.89 billion (77% male). Premature mortality costs per death ranged between €40,382 (France) and €350,325 (Switzerland). Spain experienced the highest premature mortality cost as a proportion of Gross Domestic Product (0.11%). CONCLUSION: Even in the initial period of the pandemic in Europe, COVID-19-related premature mortality costs were significant across Europe.

The threats of the COVID-19 pandemic require the mobilization of scientists, including mathematicians. To understand how the number of cases increases versus time, various models based on direct observations of a random number of new cases and differential equations can be used. Complex mathematical models contain many unknown parameters, the values of which must be determined using a limited number of observations of the disease over time. Even long-term monitoring of the epidemic may not provide reliable estimates of its parameters due to the constant change of testing conditions, isolation of infected and quarantine. Therefore, simpler approaches should also be used, for example, some smoothing of the dependence of the number of cases on time and the known SIR (susceptible-infected-removed) model. These approaches allowed to detect the waves of pandemic in different countries and regions and to make adequate predictions of the duration, hidden periods, reproduction numbers, and final sizes of its waves. In particular, seven waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ukraine were investigated. Objective. We will detect new epidemic waves in Ukraine that occurred after September 1, 2020 and estimate the epidemic characteristics with the use of generalized SIR model. Some predictions of the epidemic dynamics will be presented. Methods. In this study we use the smoothing method for the dependence of the number of cases on time; the generalized SIR model for the dynamics of any epidemic wave, the exact solution of the linear differential equations and statistical approach developed before. Results. Seventh and eights epidemic waves in Ukraine were detected and the reasons of their appearance were discussed. The optimal values of the SIR model parameters were calculated. The prediction for the COVID-19 epidemic dynamics in Ukraine is not very optimistic: new cases will not stop appearing until June 2021. Only mass vaccination and social distancing can change this trend. Conclusions. New waves of COVID-19 pandemic can be detected, calculated and predicted with the use of rather simple mathematical simulations. The expected long duration of the pandemic forces us to be careful and in solidarity.The government and all Ukrainians must strictly adhere to quarantine measures in order to avoid fatal consequences.","Nesteruk, I.",,277,1

The viable removal efficiency by and relative survivability on the biocidal filters prepared with dialdehyde starch compared to untreated filters were investigated using MS2 bacteriophage at high relative humidity (80–90%) and room temperature. Experimental results showed no significant difference in viable removal efficiency and pressure drop between the treated and untreated filters for polypropylene filtering facepiece respirators. The pressure drop of DAS treated cellulose filters significantly decreased although there was no significant change in viable removal efficiency; the combination of these two factors resulted in an increase of filter quality. All biocidal filters showed a significantly lower relative survivability than untreated filters, and the relative survivability decreased as the concentration of DAS increased. The biocidal filter treated with 4% DAS presented an average of 30% survivability compared to the baseline of untreated filters.

Understanding the Immunopathogenesis of COVID-19 is essential for interrupting viral infectivity and preventing aberrant immune responses before a vaccine can be developed. In this review, we provide the latest insights into the roles of angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) and Ang II receptor-1 (AT1-R) in this disease. Novel therapeutic strategies, including recombinant ACE2, ACE inhibitors, AT1-R blockers, and Ang 1–7 peptides, may prevent or reduce viruses-induced pulmonary, cardiac, and renal injuries. However, more studies are needed to clarify the efficacy of these therapeutics. Furthermore, considering the common role of the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway in AT1-R expressed on peripheral tissues and cytokine receptors on the surface of immune cells, potential targeting of this pathway using JAK inhibitors (JAKinibs) is suggested as a promising approach in patients with COVID-19 who are admitted to hospitals. In addition to antiviral therapy, potential ACE2- and AT1-R-inhibiting strategies, and other supportive care, we suggest other potential JAKinibs and novel anti-inflammatory combination therapies that affect the JAK-STAT pathway in patients with COVID-19. Since the combination of MTX and baricitinib leads to outstanding clinical outcomes, the addition of baricitinib to MTX might be a potential strategy.","Seif, Farhad; Aazami, Hossein; Khoshmirsafa, Majid; Kamali, Monireh; Mohsenzadegan, Monireh; Pornour, Majid; Mansouri, Davood",Int Arch Allergy Immunol,277,2

We aimed to comprehensively evaluate the efficacy of Internet- and mobile-based interventions (IMIs) for different psychological and disease-related outcomes in children and adolescents with CC. METHOD: Studies were identified by systematic searches in CENTRAL, Embase, MEDLINE/PubMed and PsycINFO, complemented by searches in reference lists of eligible studies and other reviews. We included studies, when they were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the efficacy of an IMI to control conditions in improving psychological and disease-related outcomes in youth (mean age ≤ 18 years) with CC. Study selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessment were conducted independently by two reviewers. Meta-analyses were performed within a random-effects model, and Hedges' g (with 95% confidence intervals) was calculated as effect size measure. Primary outcomes were comorbid mental health symptoms (i.e., depression, anxiety and stress), as well as quality of life and self-efficacy. RESULTS: A total of 19 randomized controlled trials (2410 patients) were included in this meta-analysis. IMIs were associated with improvements in self-efficacy (g = 0.38; 95% CI, 0.15 to 0.61; I(2) = 0) and combined disease-related outcomes (g = −0.13; 95% CI, −0.25 to −0.01; I(2) = 21). Meta-analyses on other outcomes were non-significant, and some pre-planned analyses were not feasible because of a shortage of studies. CONCLUSION: The available evidence on IMIs for improving mental and health-related outcomes in youth with CC is limited. Our findings point to a rather small benefit and limited efficacy. Future research is needed, to comprehensively assess the potential of IMIs to extend collaborative care, and to identify factors contributing to improved user-centered interventions with better treatment outcomes.","Domhardt, Matthias; Schröder, Annalena; Geirhos, Agnes; Steubl, Lena; Baumeister, Harald",Internet Interv,277,1

Importantly, some of these treatments are associated with cognitive and language changes. Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator and is a common endocrine therapy treatment for breast cancer. The current review examines the specific domains of cognition and language affected by the use of tamoxifen in women with breast cancer. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search that examined cognitive and/or language functions in chemotherapy-naïve women with breast cancer taking tamoxifen. PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, CINAHL Complete, PsycINFO, Scopus, EMBASE, and the Grey Literature Report (greylit.org) were searched. Covidence Systematic Review software (covidence.org) was used to manage the screening process of study titles and abstracts as well as full texts. A total of 17 studies were included in the review. RESULTS: A range of cognitive and language domains were reported. These were grouped into seven broad domains: attention, memory, speed, executive functioning, verbal abilities, visual abilities, and language abilities. Results showed that there is compelling evidence that specific domains of memory and speed are negatively affected by the use of tamoxifen. In addition, there was a pattern of change in domains of executive functions and verbal abilities. CONCLUSIONS: Tamoxifen affects specific cognitive and language domains. Language domains beyond semantics have not been studied and thus conclusions related to these domains, and language in general, could not be made. Studies exploring the effects of tamoxifen on the different domains of language are recommended.","Jebahi, Fatima; Sharma, Saryu; Bloss, Jamie E; Wright, Heather H",Psychooncology,277,26

METHODS: A survey was devised using a 5-point Likert scale for questions related to ISBCS, which patients undertook during their cataract outpatient appointment pre-COVID-19 lockdown and by telephone during the lockdown. RESULTS: Questionnaires were completed for 267 patients. Most respondents were aged over 71 (51%) and were female individuals (60%). Forty-five per cent agreed/strongly agreed with opting for ISBCS. A positive correlation was identified between opting for ISBCS and convenience to the patient (r=0.76, p<0.01) and family/carer/partner (r=0.71, p<0.01) and wanting to limit numbers of hospital visits (r=0.57, p<0.01). Fifty per cent agreed/strongly agreed that they were worried about the risk of simultaneous bilateral ocular complications, with this correlating with being less likely to opt for ISBCS (r=−0.49, p<0.01) and being scared of ISBCS (r=0.67, p<0.01). During COVID-19 lockdown, patients were less likely to want to minimise the time taken off work (p<0.05) and less intolerant of a prolonged hospital visit (p<0.05). Only 23% of respondents agreed/strongly agreed that they had familiarity with ISBCS. CONCLUSIONS: ISBCS was acceptable to 45% of our sampled population, suggesting limited routine implementation in the NHS is possible. Convenience and reduction in hospital visits appeared to contribute to this acceptance. Half of the patients expressed concern regarding bilateral complications and such concerns need addressing. Some attitudes did appear to change during the COVID-19 lockdown period. The familiarity of the concept of ISBCS is low suggesting the need for patient education.","Shah, Vishal; Naderi, Khayam; Maubon, Laura; Jameel, Ashmal; Patel, Darshak S; Gormley, Jack; Heemraz, Sanjeev; Azan, Elodie; Verma, Seema; Low, Sancy; O'Brart, David",BMJ Open Ophthalmol,277,16

The aim of this repeated cross-sectional study was to describe movement behaviours in Canadian children and youth six months into the pandemic (T2; October 2020) compared with the start of the pandemic (T1, April 2020). An online survey was distributed to parents (N=1568) of children and/or youth (5-17 years; 58% girls) in October 2020.

Next, the Vector Autoregressive (VAR) approach was applied in a case study at European level to prove the three hypothesis we consider. By analyzing the connection between the major variables, a positive and long- lasting impulse response function was revealed, followed by an ascending trend. This suggests that a self-multiplying effect is being generated; and it reasonable to assume that the more individuals use the Internet, the more electronic acquisitions occur.

The notes, entitled Observations after an Operation, act as a case study of the intersection of psychical, material and social relations as they play out in the immediate aftermath of surgical intervention. Using a close reading method, the article contextualises an analysis of Observations after an Operation by linking it to Klein’s wider corpus of theoretical work. It deals in turn with the representation of anxiety mechanisms in the patient experience, drawing upon Klein’s notes on the similarity with ‘anxiety-situations’ in early childhood; with Klein’s changed relation with both external objects and their counterparts in the individual’s mental landscape; with the role of sensation in phantasy, and the connection to bodily pain; with the doctor-patient relationship and the way this is perceived as being embodied in material objects, played out across two dreams experienced by Klein during her recovery; with the emphasis on illness as a form of mourning; and with the creative potential that the experience offers for a renewed structure of object relations. The article concludes that a greater attention to the role and representation of material objects, using psychoanalytic object relations theory as a starting point, can enhance how we collectively understand and assess the psychical impact of healthcare settings upon the patient.

Presence of liver injury was commonly reported in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, reports on severe liver dysfunction (SLD) in critically ill with COVID-19 are lacking. We evaluated the occurrence, clinical characteristics and outcome of SLD in critically ill patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Clinical course and laboratory was analyzed from all patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to ICU of the university hospital. SLD was defined as: bilirubin ≥ 2 mg/dl or elevation of aminotransferase levels (> 20-fold ULN). RESULTS: 72 critically ill patients were identified, 22 (31%) patients developed SLD. Presenting characteristics including age, gender, comorbidities as well as clinical presentation regarding COVID-19 overlapped substantially in both groups. Patients with SLD had more severe respiratory failure (paO(2)/FiO(2:) 82 (58–114) vs. 117 (83–155); p < 0.05). Thus, required more frequently mechanical ventilation (95% vs. 64%; p < 0.01), rescue therapies (ECMO) (27% vs. 12%; p = 0.106), vasopressor (95% vs. 72%; p < 0.05) and renal replacement therapy (86% vs. 30%; p < 0.001).

Occurrence of SLD was independently associated with presence of viremia [OR 6.359; 95% CI 1.336–30.253; p < 0.05] and severity of illness (SAPS II) [OR 1.078; 95% CI 1.004–1.157; p < 0.05]. Mortality was high in patients with SLD compared to other patients (68% vs. 16%, p < 0.001). After adjustment for confounders, SLD was independently associated with mortality [HR3.347; 95% CI 1.401–7.999; p < 0.01].

In addition, grass carp autophagy-related gene 5 (CiATG5)-induced autophagy, as well as rapamycin, showed effects on GCRV replication in CIK cells. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the total number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in CiATG5 overexpression groups was less than that of the control during GCRV infection. Enrichment analysis showed that CiATG5 overexpression induced the enhancement of autophagy, lysosome, phagosome, and apoptosis in the early stage of GCRV infection, which led to the clearance of viruses. In the late stage, steroid biosynthesis, DNA replication, terpenoid backbone biosynthesis, and carbon metabolism were upregulated, which contributed to cell survival. Moreover, signaling pathways involved in the immune response and cell death were downregulated in CiATG5 overexpression groups. Further study showed that CiATG5 repressed the expression of inflammatory response genes, including cytokines and type I interferons. Taken together, the results demonstrate that autophagy represses virus replication and attenuates acute inflammatory responses to protect cells.","Chu, Pengfei; He, Libo; Huang, Rong; Liao, Lanjie; Li, Yongming; Zhu, Zuoyan; Hu, Wei; Wang, Yaping",Biomolecules,277,29

We examined the impacts of extending the interval between two doses of mRNA vaccines in Canada in order to inform deliberations of Canada's National Advisory Committee on Immunization. Methods: We developed an age-stratified, deterministic, compartmental model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and disease to reproduce the epidemiologic features of the epidemic in Canada. Simulated vaccination comprised mRNA vaccines with explicit examination of effectiveness against disease (67% [first dose], 94% [second dose]), hospitalization (80% [first dose], 96% [second dose]), and death (85% [first dose], 96% [second dose]) in adults aged 20 years and older. Effectiveness against infection was assumed to be 90% relative to the effectiveness against disease. We used a 6-week mRNA dose interval as our base case (consistent with early program rollout across Canadian and international jurisdictions) and compared extended intervals of 12 weeks, 16 weeks, and 24 weeks. We began vaccinations on January 1, 2021 and simulated a third wave beginning on April 1, 2021. Results: Extending mRNA dose intervals were projected to result in 12.1-18.9% fewer symptomatic cases, 9.5-13.5% fewer hospitalizations, and 7.5-9.7% fewer deaths in the population over a 12-month time horizon. The largest reductions in hospitalizations and deaths were observed in the longest interval of 24 weeks, though benefits were diminishing as intervals extended. Benefits of extended intervals stemmed largely from the ability to accelerate coverage in individuals aged 20-74 years as older individuals were already prioritized for early vaccination. Conditions under which mRNA dose extensions led to worse outcomes included: first-dose effectiveness < 65% against death; or protection following first dose waning to 0% by month three before the scheduled 2nd dose at 24-weeks. Probabilistic simulations from a range of likely vaccine effectiveness values did not result in worse outcomes with extended intervals. Conclusion: Under real-world effectiveness conditions, our results support a strategy of extending mRNA dose intervals across all age groups to minimize symptomatic cases, hospitalizations, and deaths while vaccine supply is constrained.","Nam, A.; Ximenes, R.; Yeung, M.

The molecular details of how the virus navigates through diverse cellular environments and establishes replication are poorly defined. Here, we performed global proteomic analysis of the virus-host interface in a newly established panel of phenotypically diverse, SARS-CoV-2-infectable human cell lines representing different body organs. This revealed universal inhibition of interferon signaling across cell types following SARS-CoV-2 infection. We performed systematic analyses of the JAK-STAT pathway in a broad range of cellular systems, including immortalized cell lines and primary-like cardiomyocytes, and found that several pathway components were targeted by SARS-CoV-2 leading to cellular desensitization to interferon. These findings indicate that the suppression of interferon signaling is a mechanism widely used by SARS-CoV-2 in diverse tissues to evade antiviral innate immunity, and that targeting the viral mediators of immune evasion may help block virus replication in patients with COVID-19.","Chen, Da-Yuan; Khan, Nazimuddin; Close, Brianna J.; Goel, Raghuveera K.; Blum, Benjamin; Tavares, Alexander H.; Kenney, Devin; Conway, Hasahn L.; Ewoldt, Jourdan K.; Kapell, Sebastian; Chitalia, Vipul C.; Crossland, Nicholas A.; Chen, Christopher S.; Kotton, Darrell N.; Baker, Susan C.; Connor, John H.; Douam, Florian; Emili, Andrew; Saeed, Mohsan",bioRxiv,277,1

The concept of value-based healthcare has been proposed as one such approach. Since unsafe care hinders patient experience and contributes to waste, the purpose of this paper is to investigate how the value-based approach can help broaden the existing concept of patient safety culture and thus, improve patient safety and healthcare value. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: In the arguments, the authors use the triple value model which consists of personal, technical and allocative value. These three aspects together promote healthcare in which the experience of care is improved through the involvement of patients, while also considering the optimal utilisation and allocation of finite healthcare resources. FINDINGS: While the idea that patient involvement should be integrated into patient safety culture has already been suggested, there is a lack of emphasis that economic considerations can play an important role as well. Patient safety should be perceived as an investment, thus, relevant questions need to be addressed such as how much resources should be invested into patient safety, how the finite resources should be allocated to maximise health benefits at a population level and how resources should be utilised to get the best cost-benefit ratio. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: Thus far, both the importance of patient safety culture and value-based healthcare have been advocated; this paper emphasizes the need to consider these two approaches together.","Dombrádi, Viktor; Bíró, Klára; Jonitz, Guenther; Gray, Muir; Jani, Anant",J. health organ. manag,277,5

Review of documents and the Ministry of Health’s updates was carried out, followed by a series of discussions with stakeholders. Based on the steps in the outbreak investigation tasks, the flow of activities from January to May 2020 was listed in line with the phases of the country’s National Movement Control Order 2020. Results show that the activities can be classified into three different sections—namely, the main action areas, category of cases, and level of care. The main process flow of activities comprised the case management and support activities. Case management flow was split into tasks for patients under investigation and persons under surveillance, while the support services existed throughout the phases. The pathways illustrate that the progression of the pandemic translated directly to changes in the pattern of activities, with additional subgroups of activities in accordance with all imposed guidelines.","Khamis, Noraziani; Saimy, Intan Syafinaz; Ibrahim, Nor Hayati; Badaruddin, Nur Khairah; Mohd Hassan, Nor Zam Azihan; Kusnin, Faridah; Sandhu, Sukhvinder Singh; Mohamed, Masitah",Int J Environ Res Public Health,277,29

The study was aimed to explore the association between ivermectin prophylaxis and development of COVID-19 infection among healthcare workers. Methods: A hospital-based matched case-control study was conducted among healthcare workers of AIIMS Bhubaneswar, India, from September to October 2020. Profession, gender, age and date of diagnosis were matched for 186 case-control pairs. Cases and controls were healthcare workers who tested positive and negative, respectively, for COVID-19 by RT-PCR. Exposure was defined as the intake of ivermectin and/or hydroxychloroquine and/or vitamin-C and/or other prophylaxis for COVID-19. Data collection and entry was done in Epicollect5, and analysis was performed using STATA version 13. Conditional logistic regression models were used to describe the associated factors for COVID-19 infection. Results: Ivermectin prophylaxis was taken by 77 controls and 38 cases. Two-dose ivermectin prophylaxis (0.27, 95% CI, 0.15-0.51) was associated with 73% reduction of COVID-19 infection among healthcare workers for the following one month, those who were involved in physical activity (3.06 95% CI, 1.18-7.93) for more than an hour/day were more likely to contract COVID-19 infection. Type of household, COVID duty, single-dose ivermectin prophylaxis, vitamin-C prophylaxis and hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis were not associated with COVID-19 infection. Conclusion: Two-dose ivermectin prophylaxis at a dose of 300 g/kg with a gap of 72 hours was associated 73% reduction of COVID-19 infection among healthcare workers for the following one-month.

METHODS AND RESULTS: We enrolled 696 consecutive patients (mean age 67.4 ± 13.2 years, 69.7% males) admitted for COVID-19 in 13 Italian cardiology centres between 1 March and 9 April 2020. One hundred and six patients (15%) had a history of AF and the median hospitalization length was 14 days (interquartile range 9–24). Patients with a history of AF were older and with a higher burden of cardiovascular risk factors. Compared to patients without AF, they showed a higher rate of in-hospital death (38.7% vs. 20.8%; P < 0.001). History of AF was associated with an increased risk of death after adjustment for clinical confounders related to COVID-19 severity and cardiovascular comorbidities, including history of heart failure (HF) and increased plasma troponin [adjusted hazard ratio (HR): 1.73; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06–2.84; P = 0.029]. Patients with a history of AF also had more in-hospital clinical events including new-onset AF (36.8% vs. 7.9%; P < 0.001), acute HF (25.3% vs. 6.3%; P < 0.001), and multiorgan failure (13.9% vs. 5.8%; P = 0.010). The association between AF and worse outcome was not modified by previous or concomitant use of anticoagulants or steroid therapy (P for interaction >0.05 for both) and was not related to stroke or bleeding events. CONCLUSION: Among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, a history of AF contributes to worse clinical course with a higher mortality and in-hospital events including new-onset AF, acute HF, and multiorgan failure. The mortality risk remains significant after adjustment for variables associated with COVID-19 severity and comorbidities.","Paris, Sara; Inciardi, Riccardo M; Lombardi, Carlo Mario; Tomasoni, Daniela; Ameri, Pietro; Carubelli, Valentina; Agostoni, Piergiuseppe; Canale, Claudia; Carugo, Stefano; Danzi, Giambattista; Di Pasquale, Mattia; Sarullo, Filippo; La Rovere, Maria Teresa; Mortara, Andrea; Piepoli, Massimo; Porto, Italo; Sinagra, Gianfranco; Volterrani, Maurizio; Gnecchi, Massimiliano; Leonardi, Sergio; Merlo, Marco; Iorio, Annamaria; Giovinazzo, Stefano; Bellasi, Antonio; Zaccone, Gregorio; Camporotondo, Rita; Catagnano, Francesco; Dalla Vecchia, Laura; Maccagni, Gloria; Mapelli, Massimo; Margonato, Davide; Monzo, Luca; Nuzzi, Vincenzo; Pozzi, Andrea; Provenzale, Giovanni; Specchia, Claudia; Tedino, Chiara; Guazzi, Marco; Senni, Michele; Metra, Marco",Europace,277,2

Consequently, India's response to the global COVID‐19 pandemic was to impose a very severe countrywide lockdown using the mandate of the Union (federal) government. This centralized one‐size‐fits‐all diktat was imposed despite high variations across states in resources, healthcare capacity, and incidence of COVID‐19 cases. We argue that India's dysfunctional federalism is the reason for the centralized lockdown, preventing state and local governments from tailoring a policy response to suit local needs. Using mobility data, we demonstrate the high variation in curtailing mobility in different states through the centralized lockdown. We find that India's centralized lockdown was at best a partial success in a handful of states, while imposing enormous economic costs even in areas where few were affected by the pandemic.","Choutagunta, Abishek; Manish, G.

Fortunately, changes to legislation and regulation in response to the pandemic allowed Emory Healthcare to rapidly implement telehealth care. Beginning in early March 2020 and continuing through the initial 2-month implementation period (when data collection stopped), clinicians received telehealth training and certification. Standard workflows created by means of a hub-and-spoke operational model enabled rapid sharing and deployment of best practices throughout the system’s physician group practice. Lean process huddles facilitated successful implementation. In total, 2,374 healthcare professionals, including 986 attending physicians, 416 residents and fellows, and 555 advanced practice providers, were trained and certified for telehealth; 53,751 new- and established-patient audio–video telehealth visits and 10,539 established-patient telephone visits were performed in 8 weeks for a total of 64,290 virtual visits. This initiative included a new COVID-19 virtual patient clinic that saw 705 patients in a 6-week period. A total of $14,662,967 was charged during this time; collection rates were similar to in-person visits. Initial patient satisfaction scores were equivalent to in-person visits. We conclude that rapid deployment of virtual visits can be accomplished through a structured, organized approach including training, certification, and Lean principles. A hub-and-spoke model enables bidirectional feedback and timely improvements, thus facilitating swifter implementation and a quick rise in patient volume. Financial sustainability is achievable, but to sustain that, telehealth requires the support of continued deregulation by legislative and regulatory bodies.","Esper, Gregory J.; Sweeney, Robert L.; Winchell, Emmeline; Duffell, J.

METHODS: The Bureau of Labor Statistics Current Population Survey data was analyzed in a cross-sectional study. Percent change in number employed was tabulated quarterly for groups by race and ethnicity (Black or African American, Asian American, or Hispanic or Latinx compared to White or non-Hispanic or Latinx) and frontline occupation status between January 1 and June 30, 2020. Two-tailed two-sample tests of proportions were used to compare groups statistically. RESULTS: More dramatic declines in number employed occurred in the Black or African American, Asian American, and Hispanic or Latinx groups. When stratified by sector, greater declines were noted in the Hispanic or Latinx and Asian American frontline, and Black or African American non-frontline groups when compared to the referent groups. CONCLUSIONS: Structural racism has further affected people of Color through differential employment loss during the onset of the pandemic, both overall and by sector. However, the effect of sector varies dramatically across racial and ethnic groups.
