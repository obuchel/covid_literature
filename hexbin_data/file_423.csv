3743,3743,3743,"Age-Specific Excess Mortality Patterns During the 1918–1920 Influenza Pandemic in Madrid, Spain",17.728832,3.4030569,2018-08-14,"Although much progress has been made to uncover age-specific mortality patterns of the 1918 influenza pandemic in populations around the world, more studies in different populations are needed to make sense of the heterogeneous death impact of this pandemic. We assessed the absolute and relative magnitudes of 3 pandemic waves in the city of Madrid, Spain, between 1918 and 1920, on the basis of age-specific all-cause and respiratory excess death rates. Excess death rates were estimated using a Serfling model with a parametric bootstrapping approach to calibrate baseline death levels with quantified uncertainty. Excess all-cause and pneumonia and influenza mortality rates were estimated for different pandemic waves and age groups. The youngest and oldest persons experienced the highest excess mortality rates, and young adults faced the highest standardized mortality risk. Waves differed in strength; the peak standardized mortality risk occurred during the herald wave in spring 1918, but the highest excess rates occurred during the fall and winter of 1918/1919. Little evidence was found to support a “W”-shaped, age-specific excess mortality curve. Acquired immunity may have tempered a protracted fall wave, but recrudescent waves following the initial 2 outbreaks heightened the total pandemic mortality impact.","Cilek, Laura; Chowell, Gerardo; Ramiro Fariñas, Diego",Am J Epidemiol,423,22

The aim was to identify new predictors for ARDS patient prognosis, including those with clinical, pathophysiological, and atypical immunodeficiency. METHODS: ARDS patients were retrospectively included. The patients were grouped and analysed according to different oxygenation index grades and prognosis, and factors influencing prognosis and survival were examined. Adolescent patients, patients with typical immunodeficiency and patients who died within 24 h after being diagnosed with ARDS were excluded. The predictive value for mortality was determined by Cox proportional hazard analysis. RESULTS: In total, 201 patients who fulfilled the Berlin definition of ARDS were included. The severity of critical illness on the day of enrolment, as measured by the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score (P = 0.016), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (P = 0.027), and PaO(2)/FiO(2) (P = 0.000), worsened from mild to severe ARDS cases. Compared with survivors, non-survivors were significantly older and had higher APACHE II and SOFA scores. Moreover, significantly lower lymphocyte/neutrophil ratios and leukocyte counts were found among non-survivors than survivors (P = 0.008, P = 0.012). A moderate positive correlation between the lymphocyte/neutrophil and PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratios (P = 0.023) was observed. In predicting 100-day survival in patients with ARDS, the area under the curve (AUC) for the lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio was significantly higher than those for the PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio alone, body mass index (BMI) alone, and the lymphocyte count alone (P = 0.0062, 0.0001, and 0.0154). Age (per log(10) years), BMI < 24, SOFA score, leukocyte count, and the lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio were independent predictors of 28-day mortality in ARDS patients. Additionally, ARDS patients with a lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio < 0.0537 had increased 28-day mortality rates (P = 0.0283). Old age affected both 28-day and 100-day mortality rates (P = 0.0064,0.0057). CONCLUSIONS: Age (per log(10) years), BMI < 24, SOFA score, lymphocytes, and the lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio were independent predictors of 100-day mortality in patients with ARDS. The lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio may represent a potential molecular marker to evaluate atypical immunosuppression or impairment in patients with ARDS.","Song, Min; Liu, Yijie; Lu, Zhiwen; Luo, Hong; Peng, Hong; Chen, Ping",BMC Pulm Med,423,24

We tested this claim by comparing estimates of the vaccine-mortality association during the 2009/2010 influenza year, when there was essentially no circulation of seasonal influenza in the United States, and 2007/2008, a typical influenza year. We pooled data on seniors (adults aged ≥65 years) from 7 US managed care organizations that participated in the Vaccine Safety Datalink Project. We defined influenza vaccination, all-cause mortality, and potential confounders from administrative databases. We quantified the vaccine-mortality association using Cox regression. During 2007/2008, the adjusted hazard ratio was 0.44 prior to influenza season, 0.62 during influenza season, and 0.71 after influenza season. A similar pattern was observed during 2009/2010, when any effect of seasonal influenza vaccine observed during all time periods must have resulted from confounding: 0.65 during the autumn, 0.80 during the winter, and 0.84 during the summer. In a year with minimal seasonal influenza, we found no evidence that confounding in autumn preinfluenza periods is qualitatively different from confounding in winter. This supports the use of preinfluenza periods as control time periods in studies of influenza vaccine effectiveness.","Jackson, Michael L.; Yu, Onchee; Nelson, Jennifer C.; Naleway, Allison; Belongia, Edward A.; Baxter, Roger; Narwaney, Komal; Jacobsen, Steven J.; Shay, David K.; Jackson, Lisa A.",Am J Epidemiol,423,22

Many approaches are available for estimating the causal effect of an exposure. In this manuscript, we demonstrate the advantages associated with using inverse probability weighting (IPW) and doubly robust estimation of the odds ratio in terms of reduced bias. IPW approach can be used to adjust for confounding variables and provide unbiased estimates of the exposure’s causal effect. For cluster-structured data, as is common in animal populations, inverse conditional probability weighting (ICPW) approach can provide a robust estimation of the causal effect. Doubly robust estimation can provide a robust method even when the specification of the model form is uncertain. In this paper, the usage of IPW, ICPW, and doubly robust approaches are illustrated with a subset of data with complete covariates from the Australian-based National Bovine Respiratory Disease Initiative as well as simulated data. We evaluate the causal effect of prior bovine viral diarrhea exposure on bovine respiratory disease in feedlot cattle. The results show that the IPW, ICPW and doubly robust approaches would provide a more accurate estimation of the exposure effect than the traditional outcome regression model, and doubly robust approaches are the most preferable overall.","Ji, Ju; Wang, Chong; He, Zhulin; Hay, Karen E.; Barnes, Tamsin S.; O’Connor, Annette M.",PLoS One,423,22

However, previous investigations were limited to less than 6 h, and control groups did not follow clinical standards. We hypothesised that 24 h of mechanical ventilation with variable V(T) reduces pulmonary inflammation (as reflected by neutrophil infiltration), compared with standard protective, nonvariable ventilation. METHODS: Experimental ARDS was induced in 14 anaesthetised pigs with saline lung lavage followed by injurious mechanical ventilation. Pigs (n=7 per group) were randomly assigned to using variable V(T) or nonvariable V(T) modes of mechanical ventilation for 24 h. In both groups, ventilator settings including positive end-expiratory pressure and oxygen inspiratory fraction were adjusted according to the ARDS Network protocol. Pulmonary inflammation (primary endpoint) and perfusion were assessed by positron emission tomography using 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]fluoro-d-glucose and (68)Gallium ((68)Ga)-labelled microspheres, respectively. Gas exchange, respiratory mechanics, and haemodynamics were quantified. Lung aeration was determined using CT. RESULTS: The specific global uptake rate of (18)F-FDG increased to a similar extent regardless of mode of mechanical ventilation (median uptake for variable V(T)=0.016 min(−1) [inter-quartile range, 0.012–0.029] compared with median uptake for nonvariable V(T)=0.037 min(−1) [0.008–0.053]; P=0.406). Gas exchange, respiratory mechanics, haemodynamics, and lung aeration and perfusion were similar in both variable and nonvariable V(T) ventilatory modes. CONCLUSION: In a porcine model of ARDS, 24 h of mechanical ventilation with variable V(T) did not attenuate pulmonary inflammation compared with standard protective mechanical ventilation with nonvariable V(T).","Wittenstein, Jakob; Scharffenberg, Martin; Braune, Anja; Huhle, Robert; Bluth, Thomas; Herzog, Moritz; Güldner, Andreas; Ball, Lorenzo; Simonassi, Francesca; Zeidler-Rentzsch, Ines; Vidal Melo, Marcos F.; Koch, Thea; Rocco, Patricia R.M.; Pelosi, Paolo; Kotzerke, Jörg; Gama de Abreu, Marcelo; Kiss, Thomas",Br J Anaesth,423,5

NTCP-reconstituted human hepatoma cells support HBV infection, but the infection is suboptimal and no apparent HBV spread has been observed in this system. RESULTS: We found that NTCP-reconstituted HepG2 cells were highly susceptible to HBV infection after cells were cultured in a commercial human inducible pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived hepatocyte maintenance medium (HMM). The enhanced HBV infection coincided with increased NTCP expression, and was observed in six different clones of HepG2-NTCP cells. Promoter assays indicated that HMM activated the cytomegalovirus immediate-early (IE) promoter that drives the NTCP expression in the HepG2-NTCP cells. RNA-Seq analysis revealed that HMM upregulated multiple metabolic pathways. Despite highly upregulated NTCP expression by HMM, no obvious HBV spread was observed even in the presence of PEG 8000. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that this particular medium could be used to enhance HBV infection in NTCP-reconstituted hepatocytes in vitro.

The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of a combined rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and electrocardiographic (ECG) screening in a remote rural village of the Bolivian Chaco, with a high prevalence of CChC. Methods: Consecutive healthy volunteers > 15 years were enrolled in the community of Palmarito (municipality of Gutierrez, Santa Cruz Department, Bolivia) in February 2019. All patients performed an RDT with Chagas Stat-Pak(®) (CSP, Chembio Diagnostic System, Medford, NY, USA) and an ECG by D-Heart(®) technology, a low-cost, user-friendly smartphone-based 8-lead Bluetooth ECG. RDTs were read locally while ECGs were sent to a cardiology clinic which transmitted reports within 24 h from recording. Results: Among 140 people (54 men, median age 38(interquartile range 23–54) years), 98 (70%) were positive for Trypanosoma cruzi infection, with a linear, age-dependent, increasing trend (p < 0.001). Twenty-five (18%) individuals showed ECG abnormalities compatible with CD. Prevalence of ECG abnormalities was higher in infected individuals and was associated with higher systolic blood pressure and smoking. Following screening, 22 (16%) individuals underwent clinical evaluation and chest X-ray and two were referred for further evaluation. At multivariate analysis, positive CSP results (OR = 4.75, 95%CI 1.08–20.96, p = 0.039) and smoking (OR = 4.20, 95%CI 1.18–14.92, p = 0.027) were independent predictors of ECG abnormalities.

The present study was carried out to demonstrate the molecular and epidemiological characterization of HAdV Infections among children in Shandong province in China between July 2017 and June 2018. METHODS: Fecal specimens were collected from children under 5 years old with acute diarrhea. DNA was extracted from the stool specimens and adenovirus DNA was detected by PCR amplification with specific primers. The amplification products were subjected to electrophoresis and visualized on a UV transilluminator. All positive RT-PCR amplification products were sequenced and the obtained sequences analyzed by MEGA (version 7.0). Demographic information and clinical manifestation data were also analyzed. RESULTS: In total, 656 fecal specimens were collected and the overall positive rate of HAdV was 7.47%. HAdV infections were detected in all age groups, in which children aged 13–24 months presented the highest positive rate. Seasonal pattern could be observed with a peak in December, January and February. Diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration and fever were the main clinical manifestations, in which vomiting was the most common accompanied symptom. By phylogenetic analysis, four species (A, B, C, and F) were detected and seven different serotypes were identified. HAdV-41 (48.98%, 24/49) was the most common serotype followed by HAdV-3 (18.37%, 9/49), HAdV-31 (14.29%, 7/49), HAdV-7 (8.16%, 4/49), HAdV-40 (4.08%, 2/49), HAdV-1 (4.08%, 2/49) and HAdV-2 (2.04%, 1/49). CONCLUSION: This study indicated that HAdV infection was an important cause of acute diarrhea among children under 5 years old in Shandong province. The results will contribute to (a) increase understanding of the role of HAdV in diarrheal children and enhance identification of the predominant diarrhea pathogen for diagnosis; (b) avoid abuse of antibiotics; (c) monitor the change of prevalent HAdV serotypes and promote vaccine development and vaccination.","Huang, Deyu; Wang, Zheng; Zhang, Guanyou; Sai, Lintao",Virol J,423,1

The main objective of the research presented here was to identify a psychological mindset of individuals with low SES and to investigate whether this mindset mediates the relationship between low SES and symptoms of depression. Towards these goals, a series of four studies was conducted: Study 1 identified a set of ten statements reflecting a psychological mindset associated with low SES using a population-based sample from Germany (N = 1,969). Study 2 cross-validated a psychometric scale (S-Scale) that was created based on these statements in a population-based sample from Germany (N = 3,907). Study 3 introduced a longitudinal perspective and showed that the S-Scale mediated the relationship between low SES and symptoms of depression assessed one year later in a German student sample (N = 1,275). Study 4 supported unidimensionality and construct validity of a unified version of the S-Scale and confirmed the mediation effect of the S-Scale for SES and depression while controlling for confounding variables (e.g., socially desirable responding) in a U.S. American convenience sample (N = 1,000). Evidence from four studies supported the reliability and validity of the S-Scale. Controlling for a psychological mindset as measured with this scale, low SES was no longer a predictor of depressive symptoms. The S-Scale can be used in clinical and research settings to assess a psychological mindset that puts individuals at risk for depression. Overall strengths of this series of studies include the use of population-based and longitudinal datasets and the application of findings to different operationalizations of SES. Future studies should investigate whether this mindset can be modified by psychological interventions and whether changes in this mindset predict improvements in depressive symptoms.","Velten, Julia; Scholten, Saskia; Brailovskaia, Julia; Margraf, Jürgen",PLoS One,423,22

Traditional methods using microscopy and chemical or immunological stains, test cultures with selective media or target cells, or serological assays have been used effectively to identify infectious agents in biological specimens or environmental samples. However, due to increasing veterinary, medical, and public health concerns, faster and more accurate diagnostic tools have been sought. Multiplex array-based assays allow for a range of biomarkers to be rapidly and simultaneously measured within specimens (Robertson and Nicholson, 2005).

However, existing solutions suffer from slow convergence because of hand-crafted topologies. The question arises, “for decentralized parallel SGD, is it possible to learn a topology that provides faster model averaging compared to the hand-crafted counterparts?”. By leveraging spectral properties of the graph, we formulate the objective function for finding the topology that provides fast model averaging. Since direct optimization of the objective function is infeasible, we employ a local search algorithm guided by the objective function. We show through extensive empirical evaluation on image classification tasks that the model averaging based on learned topologies leads to fast convergence. An equally important aspect of the decentralized parallel SGD is the link weights for sparse model averaging. In contrast to setting weights via Metropolis-Hastings, we propose to use Laplacian link weights on the learned topologies, which provide a significant lift in performance.","Jameel, Mohsan; Jawed, Shayan; Schmidt-Thieme, Lars",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,423,24

Phase I marks the period when the concept of bioethics that originated in the West came to Japan. It was also when Japanese society faced its first difficult bioethical issues: namely brain-death and organ transplantation. Other issues emerged during this period, particularly pertaining to death, such as end-of-life medical care and euthanasia. In Phase II, the problems shifted to those pertaining to the beginning of life, such as the moral status of the human embryo. As well, during this period the government implemented ethical guidelines for research ethics. During this period, social awareness of bioethics increased, and bioethics education began to appear not only medical education, but also within high school curricula. In Phase III, Japan began to tackle its own ethical issues, such as enhancement, regenerative medicine, neuroethics, public health ethics, and precision medicine.

We explored these questions in Decimal Point, a digital learning game that teaches decimal numbers and decimal operations to middle school students. In this work, we conducted a classroom study with two versions of the game, one that encourages students to play to learn and one that encourages students to play for enjoyment. We compared these two conditions to a control condition that is neutral regarding learning and enjoyment. Our results indicated that the enjoyment-focused group learned more efficiently than the control group, and that females had higher learning gains than males across all conditions, particularly on the near and middle transfer learning items. Post hoc analyses also revealed that the learning-focused group engaged in re-practicing the same mini-games, while the enjoyment-focused group demonstrated more exploration of different mini-games. These findings suggest that emphasizing learning or enjoyment can result in distinctive gameplay behaviors from students, and that our game can help bridge the typical gender gap in math education.","Hou, Xinying; Nguyen, Huy A.; Richey, J.

The combination of confinement and protectionist measures including export bans, import tariffs and border closures that were introduced in response to the COVID-19 pandemic affect MNEs by increasing trade costs and amplifying the costs of communicating tacit knowledge. In this editorial, we draw specific attention to how these policies impact the heart of MNEs’ activities – the knowledge-intensive intangibles. Physical distancing limits the face-to-face meetings that undergird the production of intangibles in large urban hotspots. At the same time, travel restrictions constrain MNEs’ abilities to connect to and source knowledge from their foreign partners. Virtual conferencing has helped MNEs to cope with these challenges but it remains an imperfect substitute. A protracted public health crisis that would require limiting social interactions in the medium term might push MNEs to reconfigure their knowledge management strategies both locally and globally.","Van Assche, Ari; Lundan, Sarianna",J Int Bus Policy,423,24

The CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein plays essential roles both in the viral genomic RNA packaging and the regulation of host cellular machinery. Here, to contribute to the structural information of the N protein, we describe the 2.0 Å crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein C-terminal domain (N-CTD). The structure indicates an extensive interaction dimer in a domain-swapped manner. The interface of this dimer was first thoroughly illustrated. Also, the SARS-CoV-2 N-CTD dimerization form was verified in solution using size-exclusion chromatography. Based on the structural comparison of the N-CTDs from alpha-, beta-, and gamma-CoVs, we demonstrate the common and specific characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 N-CTD. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 N-CTD possesses the binding ability to single-stranded RNA, single-stranded DNA as well as double-stranded DNA in vitro. In conclusion, this study could potentially accelerate research to understand the complete biological functions of the new CoV N protein.","Zhou, Renjie; Zeng, Rui; von Brunn, Albrecht; Lei, Jian",Mol Biomed,423,24

While disinfection is recommended for maintaining a safe environment during the COVID-19 pandemic, the increased use of QACs is concerning as exposure to these compounds has been associated with adverse effects on reproductive and respiratory systems. We have determined the occurrence of 19 QACs in residential dust collected before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. QACs were detected in >90% of the samples collected during the pandemic at concentrations ranging from 1.95 to 531 μg/g (n = 40; median of 58.9 μg/g). The total QAC concentrations in these samples were significantly higher than in samples collected before the COVID-19 pandemic (p < 0.05; n = 21; median of 36.3 μg/g). Higher QAC concentrations were found in households that generally disinfected more frequently (p < 0.05). Disinfecting products commonly used in these homes were analyzed, and the QAC profiles in dust and in products were similar, suggesting that these products can be a significant source of QACs. Our findings indicate that indoor exposure to QACs is widespread and has increased during the pandemic.","Zheng, Guomao; Filippelli, Gabriel M.; Salamova, Amina",Environ Sci Technol Lett,423,16

Ensuring clients’ satisfaction with PMTCT services is one of the bases to scale up service utilization and mitigate MTCT of HIV. However, in Ethiopia, particularly in the study area, evidence related to clients’ satisfaction with PMTCT services is scanty. METHODS: A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted among women attending antenatal care in Diredawa city. Systematic random sampling was used to select 517 study participants. Interviewer-administered structured and pretested questionnaires were used to collect data. Statistical significance was regarded as P≤0.05 with a 95% CI. RESULTS: Client satisfaction with PMTCT services was 82.2% (95% CI 66.4%–94.3). Receiving the service from a hospital (AOR 2.34; 95% CI 1.5, 3.98), no formal education (AOR 2.53, 95% CI 1.52–4.2), primary education (AOR 2.17 95% CI 1.17–4.04), receiving pre- and post-HIV test counseling from the same provider (AOR 4.93, 95% CI 2.98–7.17), gestational age above first trimester (AOR 1.74, 95% CI 1.12–2.71), and waiting time ≤15 minutes (AOR 2.31, 95% CI 1.28–4.16) were positively associated with client satisfaction with PMTCT services. CONCLUSION: Client satisfaction with PMTCT services is relatively high. Receiving the service from a hospital, no formal education or only primary education, gestational age above first trimester, getting pre- and post-HIV test counseling from the same provider, and waiting time ≤15 minutes to receive services were factors associated with client satisfaction. A greater number of skilled PMTCT-service providers would improve service quality and hasten its delivery. Furthermore, providing mentoring and supportive supervision of health centers with PMTCT programs and keeping the same provider in posttest counseling is also mandatory.","Abayneh, Kinfe; Mengistie, Bizatu; Oljira, Lemessa; Tiruye, Getahun",HIV AIDS (Auckl),423,1

METHODS: We sampled gravid female Culex pipiens L. and Culex restuans Theobald from the field, allowed them to oviposit in the laboratory, and characterized the bacterial communities associated with their egg rafts and midguts for comparison through MiSeq sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. RESULTS: Bacterial richness was higher in egg rafts than in midguts for both species, and higher in Cx pipiens than Cx. restuans. The midgut samples of Cx. pipiens and Cx. restuans were dominated by Providencia. Culex pipiens and Cx. restuans egg rafts samples were dominated by Ralstonia and Novosphingobium, respectively. NMDS ordination based on Bray-Curtis distance matrix revealed that egg-raft samples, or midgut tissues harbored similar bacterial communities regardless of the mosquito species. Within each mosquito species, there was a distinct clustering of bacterial communities between egg raft and midgut tissues. CONCLUSION: These findings expand the list of described bacterial communities associated with Cx. pipiens and Cx. restuans and the additional characterization of the egg raft bacterial communities facilitates comparative analysis of mosquito host tissues, providing a basis for future studies seeking to understand any functional role of the bacterial communities in mosquito biology.

There have been isolated reports of adults developing PIMS-TS, a rare inflammatory multisystem syndrome seen in children with COVID-19 which shares common features with Kawasaki disease, toxic shock syndrome and macrophage activation syndrome / sHLH. Here we present a case of COVID-19-associated PIMS-TS in an adult complicated by frank sHLH (COV-HLH) which, after a protracted course, responded to combination immunotherapy including the IL-1 antagonist anakinra. CASE REPORT - CASE DESCRIPTION: A 22-year-old female of Nigerian-descent with sickle cell trait presented with fever, headache, sore throat, arthralgia, abdominal pain, diarrhoea/vomiting, swollen feet/legs, and macular rash on hands/forearms. A 3-day flu-like illness occurred 8 weeks earlier. Persistent pyrexia, tachycardia and hypotension required ICU admission for inotropic support. Although she briefly required oxygen, hypoxaemia was not a prominent feature. Bloods revealed CRP>200mg/L, ferritin>14,000ng/mL, raised D-Dimer, procalcitonin, Troponin-T and ALT, anaemia, lymphopenia, and neutrophilia. Computed-tomography showed mild bibasilar subpleural ground-glass changes, pelvic free fluid, and peritoneal enhancement. As treatment for suspected COV-HLH, or connective tissue disorder, intra-venous hydrocortisone 100mg QDS was given; fever resolved and blood parameters transiently improved. Second nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was positive and screen for other infection and autoimmune disease negative. Echocardiography and CTA excluded coronary aneurysms although Troponin-T peak was 330ng/L. Rapidly rising ferritin and triglycerides, falling cell counts and fibrinogen, led to a diagnosis of COV-HLH. Intra-venous anakinra 70mg (1mg/kg) BD was initiated. When pyrexia remained >40 °C, inotrope requirement persisted, cell counts fell and ferritin rose to 45,861ng/ml, anakinra was increased over 48h to 200mg BD with intra-venous methylprednisolone 1g OD x2. After 7 days anakinra was weaned to 100mg subcutaneous BD enabling discharge. Outpatient bone marrow aspirate/trephine showed reactive hyperplasia, no leukaemia or haemophagocytosis. Genomic testing showed no primary genetic cause. A week later she was readmitted with fatigue, arthralgia, pyrexia, tachycardia, haematuria, and ferritin of 23,000ng/mL (nadir 4,000ng/mL). FDG-PET showed hepatosplenomegaly with no lymphoma. Anakinra was increased to 200mg IV BD with IVIG 1mg/kg OD x2 and methylprednisolone 1g IV OD x3, then cyclosporine 1mg/kg IV BD. Fevers and haemoproteinuria resolved within 1 week and inflammatory markers fell allowing discharge on a reducing regime of subcutaneous anakinra, oral prednisolone and cyclosporine. She remained well; ferritin and FBC finally normalised >2 months after presentation. CASE REPORT - DISCUSSION: Through the UK HLH across speciality collaboration (HASC) we are aware of only a handful of UK cases of adult presentation PIMS-TS and even fewer with frank sHLH. Our patient’s ethnic background and presentation were typical for paediatric PIMS-TS. Hence, we actively excluded coronary artery aneurysms, a key feature of the Kawasaki-type variant of PIMS-TS. Initial COVID-19 swabs were negative as was extensive investigation for other sepsis triggers. A high clinical suspicion of COVID-19 led to the second positive swab and early recognition of sHLH. Diagnosis of HLH can be challenging due to its non-specific features and was even more difficult in critically ill patients during the peak of the pandemic, where bone marrow biopsy and cross-sectional imaging (key components of diagnostic scoring systems such as the HScore) were difficult to obtain. Persistent pyrexia, hyperferritinaemia and recognition of worsening trends in all relevant domains raised suspicion of sHLH. On initiation of anakinra, her HScore was only 118, although her illness peak was 162, well above the HASC agreed threshold of 132 for HLH diagnosis during the pandemic. She subsequently had a negative bone marrow biopsy in line with >50% of critical care patients with sHLH; a demonstration that biopsy proven haemophagocytosis is not necessary for a clinical diagnosis of sHLH. No other sHLH trigger was found. Early recognition and intensive treatment may have contributed to the positive outcome; sHLH mortality in ICU patients can reach nearly 70%. These decisions were facilitated by early discussion with MDT members of HASC. The initial dose of 70mg IV BD and speed of wean after an effective dose was achieved were insufficient. A longer period on 400mg anakinra daily, a slower wean, plus addition of methylprednisolone, IVIG and cyclosporin appeared to aid the resolution of her relapse. Case report - Key learning points: 1. COVID-19 infection is complicated by hyperinflammatory syndromes (cytokine storm, PIMS-TS, sHLH) in a significant minority of patients. In the absence of a treatment for COVID-19, early recognition of treatable complications should be a clinical priority. 2. Adult clinicians should be aware of PIMS-TS which may rarely occur in young adults, especially those of African descent. The CDC definition extends to those aged up to 21. Cardiac aneurysms should be actively excluded in this group. 3. The challenges associated with sHLH diagnosis became more apparent during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic where key tests were difficult to obtain. Current scoring systems are insensitive for evolving sHLH. A high index of clinical suspicion and a multidisciplinary team approach, in which rheumatologists are key, is important for early recognition and treatment. . 4. Although no other sHLH trigger was found in this case, we have seen COV-HLH patients with underlying connective tissue disorder, haematological malignancy or a primary genetic defect, which should be considered if COV-HLH patients do not respond to treatment. 5. Optimal treatment for sHLH and the hyperinflammatory syndromes associated with COVID-19 is not supported by randomised controlled trials but there is accumulating evidence for anakinra. Whilst its use in sHLH remains off-license, UK guidelines have been developed, with an emphasis on early and high dose treatment. Careful anakinra weaning regimens should be considered and patient progress regularly reviewed to avoid relapse of sHLH and subsequent readmission. Our patient also appeared to have a favourable response to corticosteroid and other combined immunosuppressive treatments including IVIG and cyclosporine. It remains to be seen if the incidence of adult-onset PIMS-TS and COV-HLH will reduce now that Dexamethasone is standard of care in adult patients with COVID-19. .","Flower, Luke; Gale, Aislinn; Elfar, Eman; Manson, Jessica; Tattersal, Rachel; Quick, Vanessa",Rheumatol Adv Pract,423,1

In an effort to limit the patient and healthcare provider exposure, telemedicine has been an essential platform. As neurosurgical providers interact with patients in the operating room, intensive care unit, emergency department, and outpatient clinics each day, they place themselves as well as their patients at an increased risk of exposure. There is a widespread need for further implementation of telemedicine to reduce viral exposure. METHODS: A single-center retrospective cohort study of patients who received neurosurgical care at a single-center tertiary academic center from February to April 2020 was conducted. Patients evaluated from March to April 2019 were included for comparison. A total of 10,746 patients were included: 1247 patients underwent surgery, 8,742 were seen in clinic via an in-person outpatient visit and 757 were assessed via telemedicine during the study period. RESULTS: A 36-fold increase in the use of telemedicine was noted after the shelter-in-place measures were initiated with a significant increase in the mean number of patients evaluated via telemedicine per week across all divisions of neurosurgery (3.9 ± 3.0 to 141.4 ± 19.8, P < .001). The majority of telemedicine appointments were established patient visits (61.2%), but the proportion of new patient visits also significantly increased to an average of 8.2 ± 5.3 per week across all divisions during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Experience with telemedicine prior to the COVID-19 pandemic allowed for rapid expansion of our program to meet the needs of our patients once the shelter-in-place measures were ordered. We provide a detailed account of the lessons learned and discuss the anticipated role of telemedicine in surgical practices once the shelter-in-place measures are lifted.","Mouchtouris, Nikolaos; Lavergne, Pascal; Montenegro, Thiago; Gonzalez, Glenn A; Baldassari, Michael P; Ghosh, Ritam; Sharan, Ashwini D; Jabbour, Pascal; Harrop, James S; Rosenwasser, Robert H; Evans, James J",Neurosurgery,423,1

This review aims to clarify the role of TLRs in the innate immunity defense against herpesviridae, and systematically describes the processes of TLR actions and herpesviridae recognition as well as the signal transduction pathways involved. CONCLUSIONS: Future studies of the interactions between TLRs and herpesviridae infections, especially the subsequent signaling pathways, will not only contribute to the planning of effective antiviral therapies but also provide new molecular targets for the development of antiviral drugs.","Zheng, Wenjin; Xu, Qing; Zhang, Yiyuan; Xiaofei, E.; Gao, Wei; Zhang, Mogen; Zhai, Weijie; Rajkumar, Ronaldjit Singh; Liu, Zhijun",Virol J,423,4

Our study aimed to identify the effects of low-dose corticosteroids on the recovery of children with MPP. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, pediatric inpatients with MPP were included from the Shanghai Children's Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia cohort study between August 2014 and July 2019. The multivariable logistic regression and propensity-score matching were used to investigate the effects of low-dose corticosteroid treatment on fever duration after admission, total fever duration, length of hospital stay, C-reactive protein recovery time, and imaging recovery time with the stratification of severe pneumonia, refractory pneumonia, inflammatory biomarkers, pulmonary images, and timing of corticosteroids. Results: There were 548 patients in the corticosteroid group and 337 in the no-corticosteroid group. The corticosteroid group showed severe clinical parameters such as more severe and refractory cases, higher laboratory values, and more abnormal imaging manifestations. The corticosteroid group also showed longer fever duration after admission [odds ratio (OR) = 1.9 (95% CI, 1.2–3.1), P = 0.008], longer total fever duration [OR = 1.6 (95% CI, 1.1–2.3), P = 0.011], longer hospital stay [OR = 2.8 (95% CI, 1.9–4.0), P < 0.001], and longer C-reactive protein (CRP) recovery time [OR = 2.1 (95% CI, 1.1–3.9), P = 0.021] in the regression model after the adjustment for severity. Although low-dose corticosteroids were associated with shortened imaging recovery time in patients with high level laboratory values, pulmonary imaging could be completely recovered in both groups.

COVID-19 caregivers face pandemic-specific challenges such as not being at patient bedside throughout the hospital stay and managing social distancing post-discharge. The current study aims to explore the unique experiences of family caregivers of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) COVID-19 patients. In-depth qualitative interviews were conducted by web conference with 13 dyads of adults who were in an ICU for COVID-19 between March and August 2020 and their primary caregiver (n=26). Participants were interviewed about the care recipient’s hospitalization and recovery journey, supports received, challenges experienced, and gaps in the system of care. Thematic qualitative analysis was conducted utilizing Watkins’ (2017) rigorous and accelerated data reduction (RADaR) technique. Caregivers played a critical role in patient admission, discharge, and recovery. Themes of caregiving challenges included self-management of COVID-19 infection, knowledge deficits of available resources and post-discharge care needs, post-infection stigma, separation guilt, deprioritized self-care, financial challenges, and lengthy recoveries with some ongoing health needs. While receipt of emotional support was considered an advantage, some caregivers expressed contact fatigue. Understanding how COVID caregivers experience illness management across the recovery journey can aid our understanding of the COVID caregiving process and identify intervention targets to improve overall health and well-being of the care dyad.","Leggett, Amanda; Carmichael, Alicia; Leonard, Natalie; Robinson-Lane, Sheria; Li, Sophia; Oxford, Grace; Wisniewski, Maren; Gonzalez, Richard",Innov Aging,423,16

However, it was found that with commercial Ni-Al composite powders with a large particle size, it is difficult to ignite the self-propagating reaction between Ni and Al to form Ni-Al intermetallics by plasma spraying. In this study, Ni-Al composite powder particles of different sizes were used to prepare Ni-Al intermetallics-based coatings by plasma spraying. The dependencies of the exothermic reaction between Ni and Al and the coating microstructure on powder particle size and spray parameters were investigated. The phase composition, microstructure, porosity and oxide content of the coatings were characterized by x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope and image analyzing. The results show that particle size of Ni-Al composite powders is the dominant factor controlling the exothermic reaction for the formation of Ni-Al intermetallics during plasma spraying. When the powders larger than about 50 μm are used, the reaction forming aluminide cannot complete even by heating of plasma flame generated at high plasma arc power. However, when smaller powders less than 50 μm are used, the exothermic reaction can completely occur rapidly in plasma spraying, contributing to heating of Ni-Al droplets to the highest temperature for development of the self-bonding effect. The positive relationship between molten droplet temperature and tensile adhesive strength of the resultant coatings is recognized to confirm the contribution of high droplet temperature to the adhesive or cohesive strength.","Zhang, Li; Liao, Xian-Jin; Zhang, Shan-Lin; Luo, Xiao-Tao; Li, Chang-Jiu",J Therm Spray Tech,423,1

Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is 1 of the fatal side effects of EGFR-TKIs. However, such type of side effect has not been observed in the follow-up during the treatment of the third-generation EGFR-TKI Almonertinib (also called HS-10296). Here, we first report an Almonertinib-induced ILD in an elderly female patient. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 70-year-old female diagnosed with “ lung adenocarcinoma with intracranial metastasis” harboring a mutation of EGFR 19DEL was administrated with Almonertinib 110 mg orally as the first-line treatment. However, she presented with chest tightness, and shortness of breath, accompanying with paroxysmal dry cough 3 months after the initiation of Almonertinib. DIAGNOSES: Extensive relevant examinations did not provide conclusive results and the chest computed tomography showed a diffuse ILD in bilateral pulmonary. INTERVENTIONS: The patient was diagnosed with Almonertinib-induced ILD in the absence of no other potential causes. She discontinued Almonertinib and was treated with oxygen uptaken and methylprednisolone. OUTCOMES: The whole symptoms were eliminated and the chest computed tomography showed ILD got remission after the prescription of methylprednisolone. LESSONS: Almonertinib has potential to cause the rare but severe interstitial lung disease. Clinicians should keep cautious of this when prescribing Almonertinib.","Jiang, Ting; Luo, Yiyang; Wang, Binbin",Medicine (Baltimore),423,1

This article provides insights into the steps for biocomposites to become a product that is ready to use by the construction industry in a structural role. The development and the adoption of such a material is tackled with the use of two concepts, i.e., technology readiness level and roadmapping, and explored in a case study on the “liquid wood”. Furthermore, interviews in the construction industry are carried out to identify the industry’s take on biocomposites.

The mathematical model describes animal-mosquito interactions in each city and the agent based-model describes the migrations of animals between cities. The coupled model allows to compute at each time the number of infected animals in all cities and to study the impact of host migrations on the dynamics of infections. The obtained results showed that quarantining certain cities can reduce the number of infected hosts. It is also observed that when the density of animal migrations increases, the number of infection cases increases. The developed model brings solutions to both models (mathematical model and agent-based model) limits.

This critique concerns a superficial understanding of internationalization as copying what globally successful universities do, thus ignoring local or national needs. But it is also related to the danger of confusing internationalization with Anglo-Americanization, in general and in various fields such as music education. Therefore, an investigation of what internationalization is with regard to music education and how it could look differently is much needed. This chapter critically analyzes internationalization in music education. At the core is the question of how internationalizing music education can be shaped in a way that overcomes hidden structures of hegemony. This chapter envisions a culturally sensitive internationalization of music education which acknowledges various teaching and research cultures. A framework, suggesting conceptual categories such as educational transfer or global knowledge production, can facilitate the formation of a united, yet diverse, global music education community. Additionally, selected concepts of community are presented that can be models for what a culturally sensitive international music education community could look like.","Kertz-Welzel, Alexandra",The Politics of Diversity in Music Education,423,7

This approach is often termed as “social,” but it neglects to consider the cultural commitment to ensuring quality, safety, and equity in health services. Our aim in this chapter is to highlight the role of culture and traditions which influence regulatory practices of the state. For South Asia, a region greatly dominated by informal social control, studying this area is critical to understanding the sociocultural obstacles to optimal health regulation and policy. We discuss in detail the types of regulatory practices and the diverse challenges to effectiveness in context to the health sectors of South Asia. Many cultural and traditional customs of the region sustain regressive and inefficient regulatory policies, including the dual practice of practitioners and commercialization of providers. Secondary data has been used from the Demographic Health Surveys to analyze the shortfalls of maternal health in South Asia, in order to highlight the role of state and society in improving protective regulatory policies for women’s health. We believe that if the regulation of the existing maternal and reproductive health services in South Asia is improved, it will help to improve the regulatory challenge for gender equity across the health sector. Thus, we suggest a 20-point agenda to improve regulation in a way that would reduce maternal and child mortality risks. We conclude finally about the utility of co-regulation in a decentralized manner but with the state at the apex for management of a regulatory system to other actors in co-governance. The decentralized approach of engaging with non-state sectors, using information exchange systems and standard setting can provide a useful way of thinking through regulatory reforms and implementing them purposefully.","Momina, Ainul; Jafree, Sara Rizvi",The Sociology of South Asian Women&#x02019;s Health,423,24

To test our assumptions, we use survey data from 155 top managers of Croatian SMEs operating in business-to-business industries. We find that an SME’s proactivity positively (negatively) influences the emergence of positive (negative) emotions. Also, we find that top managers charged with positive (negative) emotions are more prone to engage in investment (divestment) as a response to economic crisis.

The current study examined the dual language beliefs and knowledge of parents of Spanish-English preschool DLLs (n = 32). We further asked how socioeconomic and sociocultural factors were associated with parental beliefs and knowledge, and how parental beliefs and knowledge related to DLLs’ home dual language experiences and school readiness skills as rated by their teachers. Results suggested both strengths and opportunities for growth in parental beliefs and knowledge.

However, similar studies in developing countries like Nigeria are few despite the stability of schizophrenia prevalence across cultures. AIM: The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and correlates of poor premorbid adjustment amongst outpatients with schizophrenia. SETTING: The Neuropsychiatric Hospital, Abeokuta in Ogun State, Nigeria. METHODS: The premorbid adjustment of 300 outpatients with schizophrenia was assessed using the premorbid adjustment scale. Pattern and severity of psychosis, overall illness severity, global assessment of functioning and socio-demographic factors were investigated as correlates of premorbid functioning. RESULTS: About half (53.3%) of the respondents had poor premorbid adjustment and most of them were males (56.9%). Poor premorbid adjustment was associated with male gender (χ(2) = 7.81, p = 0.005) whilst good premorbid adjustment was associated with no or borderline illness severity (χ(2) = 8.26, p = 0.016) as well as no or mild impairment in functioning (χ(2) = 7.01, p = 0.029) amongst the respondents. Positive, negative and general symptomatology were predicted by premorbid adjustment at different developmental stages. CONCLUSION: Consistent with existing literature, poor premorbid adjustment was prevalent amongst patients with schizophrenia in this study and was associated with male gender, poorer clinical outcomes and greater illness severity.

A complete shutdown keeps adding fresh problems for students to learn and also for educators to effectively manage the class, likely to result in the conversion of such an offline education system into a virtual class. This study investigated and described various online learning platforms, as well as teaching resource distribution technology and modern technologies used to ensure that students can study. Overall, this relates to channels that can be used to create a confidential environment in order to prevent copying in online tests. This also outlines so many difficulties in managing online teaching methods, like learners' perceptions of e-learning being more traumatic and having a negative impact on general wellbeing and social relationships.

Therefore, the aim of this research was to describe the self-reported Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) and disease control of patients with IBD from the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and measures in The Netherlands. METHODS: This was a prospective study initiated on March 17, 2020 until July 1(st), 2020. All patients aged 18 years and older with IBD that visited the Erasmus MC (Rotterdam, The Netherlands) outpatient clinic between March 2019 to February 2020 received up to date information on COVID-19. Patients were invited to complete online questionnaires at week 0, 2, 6 and 12. The Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ), the Inflammatory Bowel Disease control-8 (IBD-control-8 and the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) on fatigue were used. The evolution of the different outcomes over time was measured using mixed models. RESULTS: Of 1151 invited patients, 851 participants (67% had CD and 33% UC or IBD-U) completed one or more questionnaires (response rate 74%). Median age of the participants was 41 years, with 57% being female. No relevant changes in total scores were found over time for the IBDQ (effect estimate 0.006, 95% CI [-0.003–0.015]) and IBD-control-8 (effect estimate 0.004, 95% CI [0.998–1.011]). There was a slight, increasing trend in fatigue scores over time (effect estimate 0.011, 95% CI [0.004, 0.019]). CONCLUSION: This first lock down due to the COVID-19 pandemic in The Netherlands did not impact on the HRQoL and disease control of patients with IBD. Up to date information may have contributed to a stable HRQoL in IBD patients even in an extreme period with restrictions and insecurities.","Paulides, E; Pasma, A; Erler, N S; van Eijk, R L A; de Vries, A C; van der Woude, C J",J Crohns Colitis,423,1

It results in serious clinical complications in humans with a high case facility rate. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to estimate the pooled prevalence of Listeria species in Ethiopia. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted on PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, Google Scholar and the Cochrane Library. All identified observational studies reporting the prevalence of Listeria species in different food items of animal and plant origin in Ethiopia were included. Three authors independently extracted data and analyzed them using STATA Version 13 statistical software. A random effects model was computed to estimate the pooled prevalence of Listeria species in Ethiopia. RESULTS: After reviewing 122 studies, five studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria were included in the meta-analysis. The findings from the five studies revealed that the pooled prevalence of Listeria species in different food items of animal and plant origin in Ethiopia was 27% (95% CI 25, 29). The highest prevalence of Listeria species was reported in beef meat followed by ice cream with prevalence rates of 62% (95% CI 50, 75) and 43% (95% CI 33, 53), respectively. CONCLUSION: The presence of Listeria species in different food items of animal and plant origin in Ethiopia is an indicator of the presence of public health hazards to the consumer, particularly to the high-risk groups. Hence, awareness creation on food safety and implementation of regulations is strongly recommended.","Diriba, Kuma; Awulachew, Ephrem; Diribsa, Kuma",Eur J Med Res,423,10

By recognizing and attaching to human cells, these spike proteins spearhead the process of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in the body. Thus, understanding their architecture and mechanics is critical to pinpointing the vulnerabilities of this coronavirus and guiding therapeutic development. To that end, here we present a review of the latest discoveries in the spike proteins’ structure and function alongside a physical model of the spike protein, highlighting features of clinical interest in antibody, small‐molecule drug, and vaccine development. The spike protein is comprised of two functional domains. The outer S1 domain includes the receptor binding domain, which recognizes and binds to an angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on the surface of a lung, heart, kidney, or intestinal cell. Then, facilitated by the highly flexible inner S2 domain, the spike protein folds in on itself and fuses the viral envelope with the plasma membrane of the human cell. In doing so, the spike protein opens the doors for SARS‐CoV‐2 to release its viral genome inside the cell. Because spike proteins are glycoproteins, meaning their ectodomain is covered with sugar chains, the virus can evade the detection of the immune system and spread quickly throughout vital organs The spike protein's position on the outer surface of SARS‐CoV‐2 and its critical role in the virus's function makes it one of the most promising targets for a coronavirus therapeutic. One novel approach to targeting spike proteins is the design of Anti‐S1 antibodies, which disarm the virus's ability to bind to the cell by attaching to the S1 subunit. The current challenge to antibody development is the flexibility of the S1 domain, which makes fusion highly effective. Further research is needed to stabilize the spike protein and maximize the efficacy of antibodies in inhibiting the virus's function. Another intriguing approach to coronavirus therapeutics is small‐molecule drug development. When linoleic acid (LA), an essential fatty acid molecule that maintains lung cell membranes, nestles into a newly discovered druggable pocket of the spike protein, the spike protein is locked into a less flexible, less infectious form. This new pocket is a putative binding site for even more potent small‐molecule inhibitors, which may be able to trap the spike protein in a completely non‐infectious form. With each new discovery surrounding the structure of the spike proteins at the heart of the COVID‐19 pandemic, we advance one step closer to developing novel therapeutics that trap SARS‐CoV‐2 in a virtually non‐infectious state.","Kohli, Khushi; Liu, Samuel; Garapaty, Arjun",FASEB J,423,1

Research on SARS‐CoV‐2, as well as the closely related SARS‐CoV‐1 and MERS coronaviruses is restricted to BSL‐3 facilities. Such BSL‐3 classification makes SARS‐CoV‐2 research inaccessible to the majority of functioning research laboratories in the US; this becomes problematic when the collective scientific effort needs to be focused on such in the face of a pandemic. However, a minimal system capable of recapitulating different steps of the viral life cycle without using the virus' genetic material could increase accessibility. In this work, we assessed the four structural proteins from SARS‐CoV‐2 for their ability to form virus‐like particles (VLPs) from human cells to form a competent system for BSL‐2 studies of SARS‐CoV‐2. After establishing the minimal system requirements for VLP production, we examined their morphological relevance with transmission electron microscopy (TEM). VLPs produced with all four viral structural proteins were approximately 100 nm in diameter and bared the characteristic coronavirus crown or ‘corona’. We next sought to evaluate the entry competency of our VLPs. GFP‐tagged VLPs were generated by fluorescently tagging one of the four structural proteins used to produce VLPs. Once incorporation of the GFP‐tagged protein into VLPs was confirmed, we used these GFP‐VLPs to infect HEK293 cells. GFP‐VLPs indeed did enter HEK293 cells and properly colocalized with endocytic markers Rab5 and LAMP1 in accordance with live virus data. To further evaluate viral entry, we made the VLP entry assay accessible to TEM analysis by replacing the GFP tag with an ascorbate peroxidase (APEX2) tag, which when oxidized produces a dark brown precipitate visible on micrographs. APEX2‐VLPs were found to be entry‐competent as well. In addition to entry, APEX2‐VLPs yield the ability to visualize VLP assembly at the ER‐Golgi intermediary complex (ERGIC) and for the first time we show localization of the structural proteins during SARS‐CoV‐2 VLP assembly, budding, and egress. In total, this research provides ample resources for other BSL‐2 laboratories interested in joining the growing field to try and understand SARS‐CoV‐2 assembly, budding, and entry dynamics, biochemical and biophysical questions on the four structural proteins, and drug screening of viral assembly, budding, and/or entry inhibitors.","Plescia, Caroline; David, Emily; Patra, Dhabaleswar; Sengupta, Ranjan; Amiar, Souad; Su, Yuan; Stahelin, Robert",FASEB J,423,24

Taking the case of Covid‐19 in the UK, we explore how voters’ assessments of the government’s handling of the economy and health were affected by four events: the first UK Covid‐19 death; the national lockdown; Boris Johnson’s hospitalisation; and Cummings’ scandal. Using a large representative weekly survey in the last year totalling over around 30’000 respondents, our results show that Labour voters had the worst assessments of government handling. The first death deteriorated perceptions of government handling of health among both Labour and Conservative voters, while Boris Johnson’s hospitalisation improved perceptions among most voters. Lockdown improved the perception of health handling but at the cost of more negative perceptions of its handling of the economy. The Cummings scandal had a negative effect on perceptions of government handling of economy but surprisingly improved perceptions of its handling of health.","Vlandas, Tim; Klymak, Margaryta",,423,16

Methods: We present here a 58 year-old PD patient with DBS, whose IPG replacement surgery was complicated by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and we report management of this patient along with recommendations for patients with similar situation. Results: As the newly-emerged coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is now announced to be pandemic, new protocols and specific measures for each individual group of patients with chronic diseases seem obligatory. Regarding our recent experience with a patient suffering from PD, on DBS treatment, who needed hospitalization, we felt useful to share our experience as a recommended protocol for similar patients in the time of current pandemic. Conclusion: Close monitoring of laboratory and clinical signs should be warranted in patients with PD awaiting IPG replacement in order to be prepared in these novel conditions that may precipitate an akinetic crisis/dystonic storm and to prevent life-threatening complications during the current pandemic.","Habibi, Seyed Amir Hassan; Romito, Luigi; Aloosh, Oldooz; Rohani, Mohammad; Moghadas, Fatemeh; Parvaresh, Mansour; Shahidi, Gholamali; Moghaddasi, Mehdi; Ziayi, Ehsan; Emamikhah, Maziar",Curr J Neurol,423,1

METHODS: The active components and target genes of JOL were screened by the TCMSP database. The targets of RSV pneumonia were obtained from the GeneCards, OMIM, DrugBank, and PharmGKB database. Then, we constructed the active component-target network and screened the core genes. The overlaps were screened for PPI network analysis, GO analysis, and KEGG analysis. Finally, result validation was performed by molecular docking. RESULTS: According to the screening criteria of the ADME, 74 active compounds of JOL were obtained; after removing redundant targets, we selected 180 potential targets. By screening the online database, 893 RSV pneumonia-related targets were obtained. A total of 82 overlapping genes were chosen by looking for the intersection. The STRING online database was used to acquire PPI relationships, and 16 core genes were obtained. GO and KEGG analyses showed that the main pathways of JOL in treating RSV pneumonia include TNF signaling pathway and IL17 signaling pathway. The molecular docking results showed that the active compounds of JOL had a good affinity with the core genes. CONCLUSION: In this study, we preliminarily discussed the main active ingredients, related targets, and pathways of JOL and predicted the pharmacodynamic basis and the potential therapeutic mechanisms of RSV pneumonia. In summary, the network pharmacology strategy may be helpful for the discovery of multitarget drugs against complex diseases.","Shen, Li; Jiang, Yiguo; Lu, Jinmiao; Wang, Guangfei; Zhang, Xiaolan; He, Sumei; Wang, Cheng; Li, Zhiping",Biomed Res Int,423,1

Government is no different. The financial health of the Government is critically dependent on the efficiency with which its banking needs are managed. The Central Bank is generally the banker to the Governments. In India, Reserve Bank of India and Government have been in the forefront of implementing various reforms to strengthen and streamline the processes involved in tax collections and transfer payments. Despite these reforms, some issues still persist and are having detrimental effect on overall efficiency of Government banking. One important factor for existence of these issues is the fact that every government transaction has to pass through a long chain of stakeholders before it is accounted with finality. Blockchain technology is an emerging technology that promises to facilitate speedy and efficient collaboration among all the stakeholders and also facilitates disintermediation to the extent possible. Further, during the crisis like situations (floods, earthquakes or COVID 19 like pandemics), immediate relief is of utmost importance and government aid should reach the vulnerable/affected citizens at a very high speed. However, it is during these stress times that physical access to banking channel gets restricted. Blockchain can facilitate decentralization of last mile delivery channel, by enabling peer-to-peer and cashless transactions even among the unbanked population.

It set out to explore the following primary questions; (a) what are the most important changes that the YC services made to YCs and their families? (b) what is it about the services that creates those changes? Semi-structured interviews were carried out in 2017, with YCs aged 9–17 (n = 8), their parents (n = 5), HYCA staff (n = 6) and professionals from other stakeholder organisations (n = 5) and a thematic analysis was undertaken. Reflecting previous research that YCs and their families have a broad range of needs, findings also reveal how YC services support them through a diverse range of interventions. Support led to a diverse range of positive changes for YCs and their families. A number of service features that facilitate change for YCs, as well as ‘key dynamics’ important in facilitating change were identified. These findings have led to a conceptual framework of how YC services facilitate change for YCs and are important for understanding the impact these dedicated services can make to the lives of YCs and how they facilitate change. Together they have implications for the development and commissioning of interventions for YCs and families and how service providers promote their support provision.","Phelps, Daniel",Child Adolesc Social Work J,423,29

We presented the SIR deterministic model and we also showed a more realistic application of this model applying a stochastic approach in complex networks. Nowadays, computational tools, such as big data and complex networks, in addition to mathematical modeling and statistical analysis, have been shown to be essential to understand the developing of the disease and the scale of the emerging outbreak. These issues are fundamental concerns to guide public health policies. Lately, the current pandemic caused by the new coronavirus further enlightened the importance of mathematical modeling associated with computational and statistical tools.

The aim of this study is not only to address this literature gap but also to explore whether problematic use and well-being differ between Facebook and Instagram users in relation to the number of received “likes” and Facebook friends/Instagram followers, as well as the importance of these “likes” and friends/followers. Sixty-nine Facebook users and 66 Instagram users completed an online questionnaire, including self-esteem, loneliness, depression, and problematic Internet use items. Overall, Instagram users exhibited significantly higher problematic use behaviour compared to Facebook users. Age and importance of “followers” were negatively associated with problematic use of Instagram, whilst only the importance of “likes” was negatively associated with Facebook. The number of Facebook “friends” was positively associated with depressive symptoms, but this was not the case for the number of Instagram “followers”. It is important to note that the number of “likes” was only negatively associated with self-esteem, but there was no association with loneliness. A potential explanation between the differences in the two platforms and well-being might be related to their different functionalities, for example, Instagram is an image-oriented platform that may boost users’ self-esteem through post “likes” but only when the users are strongly connected.","Limniou, Maria; Ascroft, Yasmin; McLean, Sarah",J Technol Behav Sci,423,27

The primary composite outcome was stroke, transient ischemic attack, or death; the secondary outcome was stroke. We used log-rank tests and unadjusted and covariate-adjusted Cox regression models to compare device closure versus medical therapy. RESULTS Among 2,303 patients, closure was not significantly associated with the primary composite outcome. The difference became significant after covariate adjustment (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.68; p = 0.049). For the outcome of stroke, all comparisons were statistically significant, with unadjusted and adjusted HRs of 0.58 (p = 0.043) and 0.58 (p = 0.044), respectively. In analyses limited to the 2 disc occluder device trials, the effect of closure was not significant for the composite outcome, but was for the stroke outcome (unadjusted HR: 0.39; p = 0.013). Subgroup analyses did not identify significant heterogeneity of treatment effects. Atrial fibrillation was more common among closure patients. CONCLUSIONS Among patients with PFO and cryptogenic stroke, closure reduced recurrent stroke and had a statistically significant effect on the composite of stroke, transient ischemic attack, and death in adjusted but not unadjusted analyses.","Kent, David M; Dahabreh, Issa J; Ruthazer, Robin; Furlan, Anthony J; Reisman, Mark; Carroll, John D; Saver, Jeffrey L; Smalling, Richard W; Jüni, Peter; Mattle, Heinrich P; Meier, Bernhard; Thaler, David E",Journal of the American College of Cardiology,423,1

The old model consisted of Standard Biopsy (SBx), that is random sampling of the prostate gland under ultrasound guidance (TRUS), in subjects with clinical suspicion of PCa. This involves the risk of not diagnosing a high percentage of tumors (up to 30%) and of an incorrect risk stratification. Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (mpMRI) has transformed the diagnostic pathway of PCa, not only as an imaging method for detecting suspicious lesions, but also as an intraprocedural guidance for Target Biopsy (MRI-TBx), thus bridging the diagnostic gap. Several single and multicenter randomized trials, such as PROMIS, MRI first, PRECISION and that reported by Van der Leest et al. have confirmed the superiority of the ""MRI pathway"", consisting of mpMRI and MRI-TBx of suspicious lesions, over the ""standard pathway"" of SBx in all patients with elevated PSA and/or positive DRE. MRI-TBx appears to be advantageous in reducing the overall number of biopsies performed, as well as in reducing the diagnosis of clinically insignificant disease while maintaining or improving the diagnosis of clinically significant PCa (cs-PCa). Moreover, it shows a reduction in the diagnosis of ins-PCa, and therefore, of overdiagnosis, when using MRI-TBx without sacrificing performance in the diagnosis of cs-PCa.","Gurgitano, Martina; Ancona, Eleonora; Maresca, Duilia; Summers, Paul Eugene; Alessi, Sarah; Maggioni, Roberta; Liguori, Alessandro; Pandolfi, Marco; Rodà, Giovanni Maria; De Filippo, Massimo; Paolucci, Aldo; Petralia, Giuseppe",Acta bio-medica : Atenei Parmensis,423,26

Cefixime (CEF) is a cephalosporin antibiotic that is used against bacterial infections. In the present study, Raman spectroscopy has been applied for the identification and quantification of Raman spectral features of cefixime with different concentrations of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) and excipients in solid dosage forms. The changes in Raman spectral features of API and excipients in the solid dosage forms of cefixime were studied and Raman peaks were assigned based on the literature. Multivariate data analysis techniques including the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Partial Least Squares Regression analysis (PLSR) have been performed for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of solid dosage forms of cefixime. PCA was found helpful in differentiating all the Raman spectral data associated with the different solid dosage forms of cefixime.

It describes the origin and development of One Health and then identifies five potential areas where One Health can add value and reduce costs. These are: (1) sharing health resources between the medical and veterinary sectors; (2) controlling zoonoses in animal reservoirs; (3) early detection and response to emerging diseases; (4) prevention of pandemics; and (5) generating insights and adding value to health research and development. Examples are given for each category along with preliminary estimates of the potential savings from adopting the One Health approach. The literature reviewed suggests that one dollar invested in One Health can generate five dollars worth of benefits and a global investment of US$25 billion over 10 years could generate benefits worth at least US$125 billion.

RECENT FINDINGS Patients with de novo acute respiratory failure should be managed with HFOT rather than NIV. Indeed, the vast majority of patients with de novo respiratory failure meet the criteria for ARDS, and NIV does not seem protective, as patients generate overly high tidal volume that may worsen underlying lung injury. However, NIV remains the first-line oxygenation strategy in postoperative patients and those with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure when pH is equal to or below 7.35. During preoxygenation, NIV also seems to be more efficient than standard oxygen using valve-bag mask to prevent profound oxygen desaturation. In postoperative cardiothoracic patients, HFOT could be an alternative to NIV in the management of acute respiratory failure. SUMMARY Recent recommendations for managing patients with acute respiratory failure have been established on the basis of studies comparing NIV with standard oxygen. Growing use of HFOT will lead to new studies comparing NIV versus HFOT in view of more precisely defining the appropriate indications for each treatment.","Frat, Jean-Pierre; Joly, Florent; Thille, Arnaud W",Current opinion in anaesthesiology,423,1

RECENT FINDINGS A few recent studies showed that a multidiscipliary approach in specialized centers can improve the outcome of AMI. Such approach incorporates current knowledge in pathophysiology, early diagnosis with triphasic computed tomography (CT)-angiography, immediate endovascular or surgical restoration of mesenteric perfusion, and damage control surgery if transmural bowel infarction is present. No specific biomarkers are available to detect early mucosal injury in clinical setting. Nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia presents particular challenges, as the diagnosis based on CT-findings as well as vascular management is more difficult; some recent evidence suggests a possible role of potentially treatable stenosis of superior mesenteric artery and beneficial effect of vasodilator therapy (intravenous or local intra-arterial). Medical management of AMI is supportive, including aiming of euvolemia and balanced systemic oxygen demand/delivery. Enteral nutrition should be withheld during ongoing ischemia-reperfusion injury and be started at low rate after revascularization of the (remaining) bowel is convincingly achieved. SUMMARY Clinical suspicion leading to tri-phasic CT-angiography is a mainstay for diagnosis. Diagnosis of nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia and early intestinal injury remains challenging.

METHODS Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor null (LDLr-/-) mice were fed Western diet with or without D-4F. We then measured atherosclerotic lesion formation, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) phosphorylation and its association with heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide anion (O2•-) production, and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) and GTP-cyclohydrolase 1 (GCH-1) concentration in the aorta. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and aortas were treated with oxidized LDL (oxLDL) with or without D-4F; subsequently, BH4 and GCH-1 concentration, NO and O2•- production, eNOS association with HSP90, and endothelium-dependent vasodilation were measured. RESULTS Unexpectedly, eNOS phosphorylation, eNOS-HSP90 association, and O2•- production were increased, whereas BH4 and GCH-1 concentration and NO production were reduced in atherosclerosis. D-4F significantly inhibited atherosclerosis, eNOS phosphorylation, eNOS-HSP90 association, and O2•- generation but increased NO production and BH4 and GCH-1 concentration. OxLDL reduced NO production and BH4 and GCH-1 concentration but enhanced O2•- generation and eNOS association with HSP90, and impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation. D-4F inhibited the overall effects of oxLDL. CONCLUSIONS Hypercholesterolemia enhanced uncoupled eNOS activity by decreasing GCH-1 concentration, thereby reducing BH4 levels. D-4F reduced uncoupled eNOS activity by increasing BH4 levels through GCH-1 expression and decreasing eNOS phosphorylation and eNOS-HSP90 association. Our findings elucidate a novel mechanism by which hypercholesterolemia induces atherosclerosis and D-4F inhibits it, providing a potential therapeutic approach.","Ning, Da-Sheng; Ma, Jian; Peng, Yue-Ming; Li, Yan; Chen, Ya-Ting; Li, Shang-Xuan; Liu, Zui; Li, Yu-Quan; Zhang, Yi-Xin; Jian, Yu-Peng; Ou, Zhi-Jun; Ou, Jing-Song",Atherosclerosis,423,1

Sterile inflammation can occur after necrotic cell death due to the release of endogenous ligands [such as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and alarmins], which perpetuate inflammation and ongoing cellular injury via various signaling cascades. Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is a significant contributor to sterile inflammation after organ transplantation and is associated with detrimental short- and long-term outcomes. While the vicious cycle of sterile inflammation and cellular injury is remarkably consistent amongst different organs and even species, we have begun understanding its mechanistic basis only over the last few decades. This understanding has resulted in the developments of novel, yet non-specific therapies for mitigating IRI-induced graft damage, albeit with moderate results. Thus, further understanding of the mechanisms underlying sterile inflammation after transplantation is critical for identifying personalized therapies to prevent or interrupt this vicious cycle and mitigating allograft dysfunction. In this review, we identify common and distinct pathways of post-transplant sterile inflammation across both heart and lung transplantation that can potentially be targeted.","Frye, C Corbin; Bery, Amit I; Kreisel, Daniel; Kulkarni, Hrishikesh S",Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,423,5

We examined the association between hypertension, obesity, and diabetes, individually and clustered as metabolic syndrome (MetS), and COVID-19 outcomes in patients hospitalized in New Orleans during the peak of the outbreak. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Data were collected from 287 consecutive patients with COVID-19 hospitalized at two hospitals in New Orleans, LA from 30 March to 5 April 2020. MetS was identified per World Health Organization criteria. RESULTS Among 287 patients (mean age 61.5 years; female, 56.8%; non-Hispanic black, 85.4%), MetS was present in 188 (66%). MetS was significantly associated with mortality (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.42 [95% CI 1.52-7.69]), intensive care unit (ICU) (aOR 4.59 [CI 2.53-8.32]), invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) (aOR 4.71 [CI 2.50-8.87]), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (aOR 4.70 [CI 2.25-9.82]) compared with non-MetS. Multivariable analyses of hypertension, obesity, and diabetes individually showed no association with mortality. Obesity was associated with ICU (aOR 2.18 [CI, 1.25-3.81]), ARDS (aOR 2.44 [CI 1.28-4.65]), and IMV (aOR 2.36 [CI 1.33-4.21]). Diabetes was associated with ICU (aOR 2.22 [CI 1.24-3.98]) and IMV (aOR 2.12 [CI 1.16-3.89]). Hypertension was not significantly associated with any outcome. Inflammatory biomarkers associated with MetS, CRP, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were associated with mortality (CRP [aOR 3.66] [CI 1.22-10.97] and LDH [aOR 3.49] [CI 1.78-6.83]).

This study aims to uncouple inflammatory from fibrotic disease activity in fibroinflammatory diseases such as IgG4-related disease. METHODS In this cross-sectional clinical study, 27 patients with inflammatory, fibrotic and overlapping manifestations of IgG4-related disease underwent positron emission tomography (PET) scanning with tracers specific for fibroblast activation protein (FAP; 68Ga-FAP inhibitor (FAPI)-04), 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), MRI and histopathological assessment. In a longitudinal approach, 18F-FDG and 68Ga-FAPI-04 PET/CT data were evaluated before and after immunosuppressive treatment and correlated to clinical and MRI data. RESULTS Using combination of 68Ga-FAPI-04 and 18F-FDG-PET, we demonstrate that non-invasive functional tracking of IgG4-related disease evolution from inflammatory towards a fibrotic outcome becomes feasible. 18F-FDG-PET positive lesions showed dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltration of IgG4 + cells in histology, while 68Ga-FAPI-04 PET positive lesions showed abundant activated fibroblasts expressing FAP according to results from RNA-sequencing of activated fibroblasts. The responsiveness of fibrotic lesions to anti-inflammatory treatment was far less pronounced than that of inflammatory lesions. CONCLUSION FAP-specific PET/CT permits the discrimination between inflammatory and fibrotic activity in IgG4-related disease. This finding may profoundly change the management of certain forms of immune-mediated disease, such as IgG4-related disease, as subtypes dominated by fibrosis may require different approaches to control disease progression, for example, specific antifibrotic agents rather than broad spectrum anti-inflammatory treatments such as glucocorticoids.","Schmidkonz, Christian; Rauber, Simon; Atzinger, Armin; Agarwal, Rahul; Götz, Theresa Ida; Soare, Alina; Cordes, Michael; Prante, Olaf; Bergmann, Christina; Kleyer, Arnd; Ritt, Philipp; Maschauer, Simone; Hennig, Peter; Toms, Johannes; Köhner, Markus; Manger, Bernhard; Stone, John H; Haberkorn, Uwe; Baeuerle, Tobias; Distler, Jörg H W; Agaimy, Abbas; Kuwert, Torsten; Schett, Georg; Ramming, Andreas",Annals of the rheumatic diseases,423,11

Whether PCT can detect secondary bacterial infections or reflect target tissue injury in this setting is still unclear. Here we performed a meta-analysis to review the prognostic value of PCT for severe disease and adverse outcome events in COVID-19.Methods: We searched relevant publications in online databases. Studies were included if they reported categorical data according to disease severity and/or outcomes. We analysed extracted data using fixed or random-effects meta-analysis models, as appropriate, depending on the presence of significant heterogeneity. Results: Data from 14 studies (3492 patients) were included in the analysis. Overall, 163 of 256 patients with elevated PCT had severe disease (63.7%) compared with 553 of 2047 with negative PCT (27.0%) (OR: 5.92; 95% CI: 3.20 to 10.94). Elevated PCT was also associated with adverse outcomes (OR: 13.1; 95% CI: 7.37 to 23.1). PCT was increased in 22.8% and 30.6% of patients with the severe course and adverse outcome, respectively. Rates of secondary bacterial infections ranged from 4.7% to 19.5% and were associated with increased risk of severe course or fatal outcomes (OR: 20.8; 95% CI: 11.6 to 37.4). Conclusions: Elevated PCT levels could identify a subset of COVID-19 patients at increased risk of severe disease and adverse outcome. Its limitations include low sensitivity and undefined cost-utility ratio. Whether PCT may be used for detecting secondary bacterial infections and guiding antibiotic therapy in COVID-19 is still undefined.","Vazzana, Natale; Dipaola, Francesco; Ognibene, Silvia",Acta clinica Belgica,423,1

TECHNIQUE The technique is demonstrated in a 69-year-old man who underwent fenestrated stent-graft repair of a 6-cm type III TAAA. The main fenestrated stent-graft was positioned without difficulty, and the renal and superior mesenteric arteries were stented. A stent-graft was placed in the CA, but angiography showed the vessel to be occluded by dissection beyond the stent-graft. Wire manipulations to regain access to the true lumen culminated in perforation. At this point, the gastroduodenal artery was catheterized with a 0.035-inch guidewire, which was advanced in retrograde fashion into the CA true lumen and then snared back to the left brachial artery forming a loop. After exchange for a 0.014-inch system, self-expanding stents were deployed into the hepatic artery. Postoperative recovery was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on day 6. At 1-year follow-up, the patient was doing very well. Imaging demonstrated no endoleak, no graft migration, and sac shrinkage to a diameter of 5.1 cm. CONCLUSION The ""loop technique"" can be a very useful and effective bailout maneuver in regaining access to the true lumen of a dissected CA in patients undergoing branched/fenestrated thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair.","Erben, Young; Oderich, Gustavo S; Gloviczki, Peter",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,423,1

Researchers in China and around the world have conducted many clinical studies on the scientific response to infectious diseases. Here, we review and summarize the registration protocols for clinical research of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Methods We searched all the registered studies in all platforms under the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) of the World Health Organization (WHO) before March 11, 2020, screened the registration scheme for novel coronavirus, extracted the basic research information, research quality, feasibility information, and described the scientificity and feasibility of interventional research. Results From January 23, 2020 to March 11, 2020, 379 clinical studies were registered, 260 were therapeutic studies among them, and 96.8% studies were conducted in China by Chinese researchers. Some studies were registered 2 weeks just after the virus was identified, and up to 22 studies registered for one day. The number of interventional studies was greater than observational studies (263 vs. 116). Among the interventional studies, nearly 50% studies were funded, 87.7% were randomized, and 79.4% of the primary outcome indicators were objective. However, the sample size of the studies ranged from 60 to 200, with the total sample size accounting for 40% of the confirmed infected population. More than 60% studies might face the problem of insufficient sample size. Conclusions COVID-19 clinical study registration has been considerable, rapid, and high quality in study design. However, the feasibility of these studies may still be problematic, especially in such as insufficient sample size, poor coordination among multidisciplinary teams, and weak quality control in the research process.","Tao, Liyuan; Zhang, Hua; Zhuo, Lin; Liu, Yuqiang; Qiao, Rui; Zhao, Yiming; Zhan, Siyan",Annals of translational medicine,423,24

Compared to standard care, continuous glucose monitoring can provide detailed information about glycaemic variability in an internationally standardised ambulatory glucose profile, enabling more informed user and clinician decision-making. We aimed to review the evidence, user experience, and cost-effectiveness of continuous glucose monitoring. METHODS A literature search was conducted by combining subject headings ""continuous glucose monitoring"" and ""flash glucose monitoring"", with key words ""type 1 diabetes"" and ""type 2 diabetes"", limited to ""1999 to current"". Further evidence was obtained from relevant references of retrieved articles. RESULTS There is strong evidence for continuous glucose monitoring use in people with type 1 diabetes, with benefits of reduced glycated haemoglobin and hypoglycaemia, and increased time in range. While the evidence for continuous glucose monitoring use in type 2 diabetes is less robust, similar benefits have been demonstrated. Continuous glucose monitoring can improve diabetes-related satisfaction in people with diabetes and parents of children with diabetes, as well as the clinician experience. However, continuous glucose monitoring does have limitations including cost, accuracy and perceived inconvenience. Cost-effectiveness analyses have indicated that continuous glucose monitoring is a cost-effective adjunct to type 1 diabetes management that is associated with reduced diabetes-related complications and hospitalisation. CONCLUSIONS Continuous glucose monitoring is revolutionising diabetes management. It is a cost-effective adjunct to diabetes management that has the potential to improve glycaemic outcomes and quality of life in people with diabetes, especially type 1 diabetes.","Lin, Rose; Brown, Fran; James, Steven; Jones, Jessica; Ekinci, Elif",Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association,423,30

IFIT proteins do not have any known enzyme activity. Instead, they inhibit virus replication by binding and regulating the functions of cellular and viral proteins and RNAs. Although all IFITs are comprised of multiple copies of the degenerate tetratricopeptide repeats, their distinct tertiary structures enable them to bind different partners and affect host-virus interactions differently. The recent use of Ifit knockout mouse models has revealed novel antiviral functions of these proteins and new insights into the specificities of ISG actions. This article focuses on human and murine IFIT1 and IFIT2 by reviewing their mechanisms of action, their critical roles in protecting mice from viral pathogenesis, and viral strategies to evade IFIT action.","Fensterl, Volker; Sen, Ganes C",Journal of virology,423,10

The authors conducted a systematic literature review and network meta-analysis (NMA) to compare the efficacy of chemoimmunotherapy versus ICI. METHODS MEDLINE, Excerpta Medica dataBASE (EMBASE), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched from inception to April 2020. Phase 3 trials evaluating the efficacy of first-line ICI or chemoimmunotherapy and reporting efficacy outcomes (OS, progression-free survival [PFS], and the overall response rate [ORR]) stratified by programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) status were included. NMA with a Bayesian random effects model was performed. RESULTS A total of 12 eligible trials comprising 7845 patients were included. In patients who were negative for PD-L1 (tumor proportion score [TPS] <1%), NMA comparing chemoimmunotherapy with dual-agent ICI failed to demonstrate a statistically significant difference with regard to OS, PFS, or the ORR. In patients with low PD-L1 (TPS 1%-49%), there was no statistically significant difference observed between chemoimmunotherapy compared with either single-agent ICI or dual-agent ICI with regard to OS or the ORR. In patients with high PD-L1 (TPS ≥50%), chemoimmunotherapy was found to be associated with an improved PFS and ORR compared with single-agent ICI, but not with dual-agent ICI. No differences in OS were observed with chemoimmunotherapy when compared with either single-agent or dual-agent ICIs. CONCLUSIONS Although chemoimmunotherapy appears to improve the ORR and PFS in patients with PD-L1-high tumors when compared with single-agent ICI, it does not appear to confer an OS benefit over single-agent or dual-agent ICI for patients with advanced NSCLC regardless of PD-L1 status. Prospective trials are needed to validate these findings.","Pathak, Ranjan; De Lima Lopes, Gilberto; Yu, Han; Aryal, Madan Raj; Ji, Wenyan; Frumento, Katherine Stemmer; Wallis, Christopher J D; Klaassen, Zachary; Park, Henry S; Goldberg, Sarah B",Cancer,423,1

Despite the great potential of this knowledge to improve biodiversity science, conservation, and policy, evolutionary biologists have generally devoted limited attention to these broader implications. Likewise, many workers in biodiversity science have underappreciated the fundamental relevance of evolutionary biology. The aim of this article is to summarize and illustrate some ways in which evolutionary biology is directly relevant. We do so in the context of four broad areas: (1) discovering and documenting biodiversity, (2) understanding the causes of diversification, (3) evaluating evolutionary responses to human disturbances, and (4) implications for ecological communities, ecosystems, and humans. We also introduce bioGENESIS, a new project within DIVERSITAS launched to explore the potential practical contributions of evolutionary biology. In addition to fostering the integration of evolutionary thinking into biodiversity science, bioGENESIS provides practical recommendations to policy makers for incorporating evolutionary perspectives into biodiversity agendas and conservation.

However, these areas also decrease visualization of target tumors, making it difficult to assess whether they completely cover the tumors. To estimate the effects of RFA more precisely, we used an image fusion system (IFS). PATIENTS AND METHODS We enrolled patients with a single HCC who received RFA with or without the IFS. In the IFS group, we drew a spherical marker along the contour of a target tumor on reference images immediately after administering RFA so that the synchronized spherical marker represented the contour of the target tumor on real-time ultrasound images. When the high echoic area completely covered the marker, we considered the ablation to be complete. We compared outcomes between the IFS and control groups. RESULTS We enrolled 25 patients and 20 controls, and the baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups. The complete ablation rates during the first RFA session were significantly higher in the IFS group compared with those in the control group (88.0% vs. 60.0%, P = 0.041). The number of RFA sessions was significantly smaller in the IFS group compared with that in the control group (1.1 ± 0.3 vs. 1.5 ± 0.7, P = 0.016). CONCLUSIONS The study suggested that the IFS enables a more precise estimation of the effects of RFA on HCC, contributing to enhanced treatment efficacy and minimized patient burden.","Toshikuni, Nobuyuki; Matsue, Yasuhiro; Ozaki, Kazuaki; Yamada, Kaho; Hayashi, Nobuhiko; Tsuchishima, Mutsumi; Tsutsumi, Mikihiro",Radiology and oncology,423,1

However, the branching of this artery and the drainage patterns of this vein vary among individuals, and the characteristics and perfusion region of this artery in elderly patients remain unclear. AIM To evaluate the characteristics and perfusion region of the IMA in elderly patients using angiography. METHODS We enrolled 154 patients (> 65 years old) who underwent digital subtraction angiography of the IMA. The characteristics, bifurcation, and distribution of the IMA and termination of the anastomotic perfusion of the left colon and rectum were examined using digital subtraction angiography. Collateral arterial arches and the IMA hemoperfusion region were also recorded. Perfusion regions were cross-referenced with clinical and anatomical features by the univariate analysis. RESULTS Of 154 patients, 25 (16.2%) had IMA lesions. The left colic artery arose independently from the IMA in 44.2% of patients, shared a trunk with the sigmoid artery in 35.1%, shared an opening with the sigmoid and superior rectal arteries in 16.9%, and was absent in 5.1%. The IMA perfusion region stopped at the splenic flexure in 50 (32.5%) patients. The collateral circulation existed in the colonic perfusion region, including the marginal artery (Drummond's artery), the ascending branch of the left colonic artery to supply the transverse colon, and the arc of Riolan with a frequency of 100%, 22.7%, and 1.9%, respectively. The IMA perfusion region was independently associated with the comorbidity of atherosclerosis, IMA atherosclerotic lesion, branching pattern, collateral circulation, and marginal artery integrity. CONCLUSION The IMA and its branches are prone to arteriosclerosis, and IMA perfusion may be interrupted at the splenic flexure in elderly patients. The applicability and precision of preoperative angiography for evaluating the IMA branching and perfusion patterns could facilitate geriatric laparoscopic left-sided colorectal cancer surgery with suspicion of poor IMA perfusion.","Zhang, Chao; Li, Ang; Luo, Tao; Li, Yu; Li, Fei; Li, Jia",World journal of gastroenterology,423,25

Many prior studies of the epidemiology of asthma exacerbations have relied upon data from hospital care. OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to determine US patterns of geographic and seasonal variations of asthma exacerbations being defined as asthma episodes requiring hospital care and/or a prescription for oral steroid. METHODS The study was a retrospective observational cohort study using administrative claims data for insured individuals from the HealthCore Integrated Research Database, including around 43 million members in the United States. Analyses examined 3 age groups, 6-17, 18-64, and ≥65 years and four US regions, Northeast, Southeast, Central, and Western. RESULTS Monthly rates of asthma exacerbations showed the greatest variation over the year in children, less so in adults and in the elderly. Clinically important differences in rates of asthma exacerbation were observed between regions with the Western Region having the lowest in all three age groups followed by the Northeast, Central, and Southeast regions. Peaks in children occurred in the early fall following troughs in the summer months, and peaks at year-end occurred in adults, particularly in those over 65 years. CONCLUSIONS There is a striking seasonal variation in asthma exacerbations in the United States.

Careful attention to closure can lead to virtually ""scarless"" surgery. In this article, we present our first experiences with SILS appendicectomy and cholecystectomy. METHOD SILS appendicectomy and cholecystectomy was performed in 12 and 14 patients, respectively. Data were collected prospectively and analyzed retrospectively from case notes and the theater database. RESULTS The average operating times were 61.3 and 142.9 minutes for SILS appendicectomy and SILS cholecystectomy, respectively. There was a good correlation between increasing experience and a reduction in operative time with Pearson's coefficient being -1 for appendicectomy and -0.56 for cholecystectomy. There were no postoperative complications in the SILS appendicectomy group. One patient in the SILS cholecystectomy group suffered a postoperative biliary leak from an accessory duct of Lushka. CONCLUSIONS In our series, we have demonstrated SILS to be a safe and efficacious method for appendicectomy and cholecystectomy.

Building on a grounded cognition framework, we investigated AAT effects on the visual representation of stimuli (here, neutral faces). We formulated specific predictions regarding the facial features that should be the most biased and the conditions under which the effect should be the strongest. We tested these predictions in five preregistered experiments using a reverse correlation paradigm. In Experiments 1-2, the facial representations resulting from an AAT looked more ""approachable"" and ""avoidable,"" respectively. Specifically, we observed more bias on facial traits related to approach/avoidance (e.g., trustworthiness) than on traits less relevant for these actions (e.g., cleverness). Experiment 2 additionally tested the unique contribution of both approach and avoidance as compared to control actions. Experiments 3A-4 showed that this effect depends on experiencing the AAT (compared to the mere instructions of approach/avoidance) and on the sensory aspects of approach/avoidance that are mimicked in the AAT. Finally, Experiment 5 supported the idea that the AAT effect still emerges in the absence of explicit instructions of approach/avoidance (i.e., by only leaving the sensory aspects of approach/avoidance). The present research enriches the literature by revealing AAT effects that extend beyond mere evaluative consequences to the visual representation of the target stimuli. Our results also inform existing theoretical views on AAT effects.

METHODS Fifty male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 10 groups (n=5 in each group) and orally treated with 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg body weight each of methanol, aqueous ethanol (H-EtOH) and chloroform extracts of A. djalonensis. Corn oil was used as vehicle (2 mL/kg). After 60 days of treatment, testosterone (T) and cholesterol (CHOL) concentrations, catalase (CAT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities in the testes along with myeloperoxidase (MPO) activities and nitrite concentrations (NO) in the serum and testes as well as sperm quality were measured. RESULTS T and CHOL concentrations along with 3β-HSD activity were significantly higher in the animals treated with the low dose than in those treated with the high dose of the chloroform extract (P<0.05). Furthermore, the chloroform extract was more effective than the methanol extract that had the most marginal effect on T level at the high dose and the H-EtOH extract that was only effective at the medium dose. LDH activity was dose-dependently increased by the extracts in all groups. The CAT-SOD antioxidant system was increased in the treated animals at all doses compared to the control values, but the increase in glutathione level reached significant level in those treated with the low dose H-EtOH aqueous ethanol extract (P<0.05). Only the high dose of chloroform extract had significant inhibitory effects on MPO activity (P<0.05). Serum NO concentration was decreased at all doses of the extracts. The inhibitory effects of the extracts on testicular NO concentrations follow this order, chloroform extract > H-EtOH > methanol. Although all extracts at all doses showed excellent stimulatory effects on sperm quality (count, motility and morphology), the methanol extract at the high dose was the most effective on sperm count (P<0.05). CONCLUSION The chloroform extract of A. djalonensis has better androgen-like and anti-inflammatory effects whereas the methanol extract has the best effect on sperm count.","Ezirim, Chioma Yvonne; Abarikwu, Sunny O; Mgbudom-Okah, Chidimma J; Uwakwe, Augustine A; Njoku, Rex-Clovis C; Ogunlaja, Aemere",Chinese journal of integrative medicine,423,22

Choice of the hypnotic agent could impact on that. This study investigated the differences between recoveries after remifentanil-propofol and remifentanil-desflurane anesthesias guided by bispectral index (BIS®). METHODS Forty patients were randomly assigned into 2 groups according to the anesthesia technique applied: remifentanil-propofol (REM-PRO) and remifentanil-desflurane (REM-DES). After the discontinuation of the anesthetics, the times to extubation, to obey commands and to recover the airway protection reflex were recorted. In the post-anesthetic recovery room (PACU) it was recorded the occurrence of nausea and vomiting (PONV), scores of Ramsay sedation scale and of numeric pain scale (NPS), morphine dose and length of stay in the unit. RESULTS Data from 38 patients were analyzed: 18 from REM-PRO and 20 from REM-DES group. Anesthesia times were similar (REM-PRO=193min, SD 79.9 vs. 175.7min, SD 87.9 REM-DES; p=0.5). REM-DES had shorter times than REM-PRO group: time to follow command (8.5min; SD 3.0 vs. 5.6min; SD 2.5; p=0.0) and extubation time (6.2 minutes; 3.1-8.5 vs. 9.5 minutes; 4.9-14.4; p=0.0). Times to recover airway protective reflex were similar: 16 patients from REM-PRO (88.9%) restored the airway protective reflex 2min after extubation vs. 17 from REM-DES (89.5%); and 2 patients from REM-PRO (11.1%) vs. 2 from REM-DES (10.5%) 6min after extubation, p=1. Ramsay sedation score, NPS, PONV incidents, morphine dose and PACU stay of length PACU were also similar.

We aimed to describe 3DARM values in asymptomatic volunteers and those with fecal incontinence (FI) or chronic constipation (CC), and identify which variables differentiate best these groups. METHODS Asymptomatic subjects were stratified by sex, age, and parity. Those with FI or CC were included according to anorectal symptom questionnaires. Endoanal ultrasound examination and 3DARM were performed the same day. Anal pressures were analyzed at rest, during voluntary squeeze, and during push maneuver, and compared between the 3 groups. Anal pressure defects were defined and compared to ultrasound defects. KEY RESULTS A total of 126 subjects (113 female, mean age 52 years, range 18-83) were included; 36 asymptomatic, 38 FI, 42 CC. Anal resting and squeeze pressures, and rectal sensitivity values were lower in FI women than in the other groups. Typical anal sphincter asymmetry during squeezing was less frequently observed in FI women. A dyssynergic pattern during push maneuver was found in 70% of asymptomatic subjects, and with a similar frequency in the 2 symptomatic groups. There was slight concordance between 3D-pressure defects and ultrasound defects.

MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 56 patients who underwent 67 lung RF sessions were analyzed. Post-ablation fever (≥ 37.0°C) was graded according to the common toxicity criteria of adverse events v. 4.0. Fever ≥ 37.0°C and <38.0°C was defined as grade 0 fever. The 67 RF sessions were divided into two groups according to the presence of post-ablation fever, and the factors associated with fever were determined using univariate and multivariate analyses. Subsequently, the RF sessions accompanied by post-ablation fever were further divided into two groups according to the grade of fever (grade 0 vs. grade ≥ 1), and the factors associated with the grade of fever were determined. RESULTS Grade 0, 1, and 2 fever accompanied 36 (54%), 11 (16%), and 2 (3%) sessions, respectively. Post-ablation fever was significantly associated with larger ablated parenchymal volume (P=0.001) and development of pulmonary infiltration (P=0.004). Additionally, development of pulmonary infiltration (P=0.048) was also significantly and independently associated with higher grade of fever in the multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS The incidences of grade 0, 1, and 2 post-ablation fever were 54%, 16%, and 3%, respectively. Larger ablated parenchymal volume and development of pulmonary infiltration were found to be associated with the development of post-ablation fever, with the latter being an independent factor associated with higher grade of fever.","Masaoka, Yoshihisa; Hiraki, Takao; Gobara, Hideo; Iguchi, Toshihiro; Fujiwara, Hiroyasu; Matsui, Yusuke; Toyooka, Shinichi; Soh, Junichi; Kiura, Katsuyuki; Kanazawa, Susumu",European journal of radiology,423,13

AIM To assess and investigate the risk of exposure to COVID-19 in nurses working in the Italian prison system. METHODS A multicenter observational descriptive study was conducted, enrolling a convenience sample composed of nurses registered with SIMSPE onlus (Italian Society of Penitentiary Medicine and Health), working in any Italian prison facility at the time of the survey. RESULTS 204 nurses participating in the survey (response rate 49.27%). Most nurses working in prisons (92.65%) were exposed to the risk of Covid-19 virus infection, since they came directly into contact with positive patients (90.69%) and in situations where they were exposed during care procedures in which aerosol was produced by the patient (56.21%). The number of nurses who ""always"" complied with safety rules for prevention of infection did not differ significantly (p >0.05 for each comparison) in situations involving or not involving aerosol exposure. CONCLUSIONS The results highlight the relevance of these issues in the Italian prison context and the need for further investigation. The knowledge of the dimension of this phenomenon, unexplored before this study in this context, represents the first step to be able to identify organizational strategies to manage it effectively or, if possible, to prevent it.","Delli Poggi, Alessandro; Pintus, Giulia; Meani, Luca; Ruta, Federico; Batta, Manuela; Brai, Emanuele; Terzoni, Stefano; Ferrara, Paolo",Professioni infermieristiche,423,29

Concurrent social media posts reflected a wider range of symptoms of COVID-19 besides these three symptoms. Because social media data have a potential application in the early identification novel virus symptoms, this study aimed to explore what symptoms mentioned in COVID-19-related social media posts during the early stages of the pandemic. METHODS We collected COVID-19-related Twitter tweets posted in English language between March 30, 2020 and April 19, 2020 using search terms of COVID-19 synonyms and three common COVID-19 symptoms suggested by the CDC in March. Only unique tweets were extracted for analysis of symptom terms. RESULTS A total of 36 symptoms were extracted from 30,732 unique tweets. All the symptoms suggested by the CDC for COVID-19 screening in March, April, and May were mentioned in tweets posted during the early stages of the pandemic. DISCUSSION The findings of this study revealed that many COVID-19-related symptoms mentioned in Twitter tweets earlier than the announcement by the CDC.

During April 2021, the city became overwhelmed by COVID-19 cases and fatalities, as a new variant B.1.617.2 (Delta) replaced B.1.1.7 (Alpha). A Bayesian model explains the growth advantage of Delta through a combination of increased transmissibility and reduced sensitivity to immune responses generated against earlier variants (median estimates; ×1.5-fold, 20% reduction). Seropositivity of an employee and family cohort increased from 42% to 87.5% between March and July 2021, with 27% reinfections, as judged by increased antibody concentration after a previous decline.

METHODS Fifty consecutive patients who received TLH for large uterine myomas and/or adenomyoses weighing 500 g or more between February 2009 and December 2012 were retrospectively reviewed. SPA and conventional TLH were each performed in 25 patients. Surgical outcomes, including operation time, estimated blood loss, postoperative hemoglobin change, postoperative hospital stay, postoperative pain, and perioperative complications, were compared between the two groups. RESULTS There were no significant demographic differences between the two groups. All operations were completed laparoscopically with no conversion to laparotomy. Total operation time, uterus weight, estimated blood loss, and postoperative hemoglobin change did not significantly differ between the two groups. Postoperative hospital stay was significantly shorter for the SPA-TLH group compared to that of the conventional TLH group (median [range], 3 [2.0-6.0] vs. 4 [3-7] days; P=0.004]. There were no inter-group differences in postoperative pain at 6, 24, and 72 hours after surgery. There was only one complicated case in each group. CONCLUSION SPA-TLH in patients with large uteri weighing 500 g or more is as feasible as conventional TLH.

METHODS Retrospective study of 182 consecutive patients who underwent transcatheter retrograde varicocele embolization from July 2011 to May 2015 with glue (Glubran(®)2) (group 1, n=63), mechanical agents (coils and/or plugs) (group 2, n=53) or a sclerosing agent (polidocanol) (group 3, n=66). Patients were asked by telephone interview to evaluate pain during embolization and at 1, 7 and 30 days using a quantitative pain scale ranging from 0 to 10. Duration of scopy, kinetic energy released per unit mass (kerma) and dose area product (DAP) were assessed as radiation parameters during embolization procedures. Recurrence rates after treatment were also evaluated. Statistical analyses were performed using parametric and non-parametric tests. RESULTS Patients in the three study groups were comparable for age, clinical indication and embolization side. No difference was noted for significant pain (pain score ≥3) during embolization and at 1, 7 and 30 days after treatment. Discomfort (pain score <3) was more frequent in group 1 than in groups 2 and 3 at 7 days after the procedure (P=0.049). No difference in discomfort was noted during embolization or at 1 and 30 days. Duration of scopy was shorter (P<0.0001) and kerma was lower (P=0.0087) in group 1 than in groups 2 and 3. DAP was lower in group 1 than in group 2 (P=0.04) but no difference was noted between groups 1 and 3, and groups 2 and 3. The recurrence rate at a mean follow-up of 24.4 months (range, 2-53 months) was significantly lower in group 1 than in the two other groups (P=0.032). CONCLUSIONS The use of Glubran(®)2 acrylic glue for varicocele embolization is safe and leads to less radiation and lower recurrence rates than is the case for other embolic materials without any more significant pain.","Favard, Nicolas; Moulin, Morgan; Fauque, Patricia; Bertaut, Aurélie; Favelier, Sylvain; Estivalet, Louis; Michel, Frédéric; Cormier, Luc; Sagot, Paul; Loffroy, Romaric",Quantitative imaging in medicine and surgery,423,13

This process involves a discontinuous step during the synthesis of minus-sense RNA that is modulated by transcription-regulating sequences located at the 3' end of the leader (TRS-L) and also preceding each viral gene (TRS-Bs). TRSs include a highly conserved core sequence (CS) (5'-CUAAAC-3') and variable flanking sequences. It has been previously proposed that TRS-Bs act as attenuation or stop signals during the synthesis of minus-sense RNAs. The nascent minus-stranded RNA would then be transferred by a template switch process to the TRS-L, which acts as the acceptor RNA. To study whether the TRS-L is structured and to determine whether this structure has a functional impact on genomic and subgenomic viral RNA synthesis, we have used a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and UV thermal denaturation approaches together with site-directed mutagenesis and in vivo transcriptional analyses. The results indicated that a 36-nucleotide oligomer encompassing the wild-type TRS-L forms a structured hairpin closed by an apical AACUAAA heptaloop. This loop contains most of the CS and is isolated from a nearby internal loop by a short Watson-Crick base-paired stem. TRS-L mutations altering the structure and the stability of the TRS-L hairpin affected replication and transcription, indicating the requirement of a functional RNA hairpin structure in these processes.","Dufour, David; Mateos-Gomez, Pedro A; Enjuanes, Luis; Gallego, José; Sola, Isabel",Journal of virology,423,31

The neuroplasticity mechanisms supporting this effect are, however, still unknown. Using data from a three-arm single-blind randomized controlled trial including acute stroke patients (N=38) and a 3-month follow-up, we set out to compare the neuroplasticity effects of daily listening to self-selected vocal music, instrumental music, and audiobooks on both brain activity and structural connectivity of the language network. Using deterministic tractography we show that the 3-month intervention induced an enhancement of the microstructural properties of the left frontal aslant tract (FAT) for the vocal music group as compared to the audiobook group. Importantly, this increase in the strength of the structural connectivity of the left FAT correlated with improved language skills. Analyses of stimulus-specific activation changes showed that the vocal music group exhibited increased activations in the frontal termination points of the left FAT during vocal music listening as compared to the audiobook group from acute to 3-month post-stroke stage. The increased activity correlated with the structural neuroplasticity changes in the left FAT. These results suggest that the beneficial effects of vocal music listening on post-stroke language recovery are underpinned by structural neuroplasticity changes within the language network and extend our understanding of music-based interventions in stroke rehabilitation.Significance statementPost-stroke language deficits have a devastating effect on patients and their families. Current treatments yield highly variable outcomes and the evidence for their long-term effects is limited. Patients often receive insufficient treatment that are predominantly given outside the optimal time window for brain plasticity. Post-stroke vocal music listening improves language outcome which is underpinned by neuroplasticity changes within the language network. Vocal music listening provides a complementary rehabilitation strategy which could be safely implemented in the early stages of stroke rehabilitation and seems to specifically target language symptoms and recovering language network.","Sihvonen, Aleksi J; Ripollés, Pablo; Leo, Vera; Saunavaara, Jani; Parkkola, Riitta; Rodríguez-Fornells, Antoni; Soinila, Seppo; Särkämö, Teppo",eNeuro,423,1

However, neither the patient selection criteria nor the long-term results of this technique have been reported. Our objective is to discuss our experience with five patients who received a TLAWR. METHODS All patients with a midline incisional hernia who underwent a TLAWR from September 2008 to October 2009 were retrospectively reviewed for early and late postoperative complications. RESULTS A total of five patients underwent the procedure, with a mean age of 48.6 ± 7.9 years. The mean length of stay was 9.2 ± 5.4 days, and follow-up was 12.3 ± 6.8 months. The mean defect size was 175.8 ± 56.2 cm(2). There were no early or late wound complications. Two patients had an early respiratory complication, and one patient developed a port site hernia and small bowel obstruction early after procedure, which required a re-operation. Three patients (60 %) experienced a recurrence. Possible risk factors for recurrence include previous failed hernia repair, loss of domain, large hernias and close proximity to bony structures. CONCLUSIONS Although TLAWR is feasible and improves wound complications, it may be associated with higher recurrence.

Stress thereby plays a decisive role in the etiology and progression of overweight and obesity, leading to several chronic diseases such as diabetes, and mental health disorders. The interplay of biological and psychometric correlates of stress, anthropometric, immunological and metabolic parameters and psychosocial factors such as gender roles, however, remains poorly understood. METHODS In this exploratory study, 43 healthy women were assessed for glucose metabolism by an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and computation of functional parameters for insulin secretion, sensitivity and resistance. Further, the fatty liver index and anthropometric parameters body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), body fat and lean mass were assessed. Psychological stress assessment included the ""brief symptom inventory"" (BSI), the ""burn-out dimensions inventory"" (BODI) and perceived stress scale (PSS). Biological stress response was evaluated with heart rate variability (HRV) and cortisol levels. Finally, gender role self-identification was assessed with the ""Bem sex role inventory"" (BSRI). Generalized linear models were computed for exploratory association with psychometric outcome. Uncorrected p-values are reported. RESULTS Burn-out and perceived stress scores were associated with insulin secretion, sputum cortisol, TSH, anthropometric measures and gender role. BSI ratings for psychiatric symptom dimensions were associated with insulin resistance, sex hormones, anthropometric measures and gender role. Female self-identification was associated with higher BMI as well as body fat and a higher fatty liver index. CONCLUSION Considering the increased risk of unfavorable metabolic, cardiovascular and also mental health outcome in obese women, a higher BMI in women with predominant female gender self-identification may be relevant for clinical risk assessment. The broad range of interacting biological, psychological and gender-related parameters calls for an integrative management of both mental and endocrinological health. However, the exploratory nature of the study calls for replication in larger samples before definite conclusion can be drawn.","Kautzky, Alexander; Heneis, Kathrin; Stengg, Karin; Fröhlich, Sabine; Kautzky-Willer, Alexandra",Neuroendocrinology,423,1

The proposed PTB7-Th/H2O2 system without any sensitizer could surmount defect of the poor photoelectric conversion efficiency of PTB7-Th, leading to the unexpected 10-fold photocurrent enhancement compared to the common PTB7-Th/PBS system. The strong enhancement effect might originate from the special function of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) towards PTB7-Th. On the one hand, H2O2 as electron acceptor could continuously capture photogenerated electrons located at acceptor part of PTB7-Th, which would visibly improve the charge separation efficiency of PTB7-Th and the electron-receiving property of electrolyte solution, thus leading to the obviously enhanced photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE). More importantly, H2O2 as oxidant could oxidize PTB7-Th to obtain oxidation product of PTB7-Th (OPP) with carbonyl group and carboxyl group, and the electron cloud density in donor part of the OPP was higher than that of PTB7-Th, therefrom producing the stronger electron-donating property and higher photoelectrochemical (PEC) reaction efficiency. As a proof of concept, the proposed PTB7-Th/H2O2 system was successfully applied in the construction of a label-free PEC aptasensor for sensitive analysis of CRP, which performed a wide detection range from 1 pM to 1000 nM with a low detection limit of 0.33 pM. This study demonstrated a novel approach to the rational design of photoelectric conversion system with high PEC performance and provided an inspired tack for the construction of high-efficiency photoelectric devices.","Li, Meng-Jie; Wang, Hai-Jun; Yuan, Ruo; Chai, Ya-Qin",Biosensors & bioelectronics,423,7

Frequency analysis parameters from the total shear stress versus time response to translational 1 Hz sinusoidal shear deformation over 50 cycles measure the interaction with respect to the three factors: tissue type, sinusoidal deformation amplitude and direction of the shear deformation. Significant 1, 3, and 5 Hz components exist in this order of descending magnitude for shear deformation amplitudes of either 25% or 50% of the specimen length. Evaporation tests indicate that the amount of free water in both aneurysmal and non-pathological tissue is nearly the same. The interstitial fluid-solid interaction under shear deformation is visible in the shoulders of the total shear stress versus time response curve that are caused by the 3 Hz component. During a single deformation cycle, the ratio of the amplitudes of the 3 Hz and the 1 Hz components measures the normalized amount of interaction. Under translational sinusoidal shear deformation at 25% amplitude, this interaction ratio is statistically smaller in non-pathologic than in aneurysmal human ascending aortic tissue in the circumferential direction. The frequency analysis parameters provide evidence that the structural changes in aneurysmal tissue induce an increase in the interstitial fluid-medial solid interaction shear force which contributes to the propensity for aneurysmal rupture.","Haslach, Henry W; Gipple, Jenna; Harwerth, Jason; Rabin, Joseph",Acta biomaterialia,423,13

Breathing discomfort due to increased breathing resistance is known to be a problem with the use of N95 respirators but there is a lack of scientific data to quantify this effect. The purpose of this study was to assess objectively the impact of wearing N95 face masks on breathing resistance. A total of 14 normal adult volunteers (seven males and seven females) were recruited in this study. Nasal airflow resistance during inspiration and expiration was measured using a standard rhinomanometry and nasal spirometry. A modified full face mask was produced in-house in order to measure nasal resistance with the use of N95 (3M 8210) respirators. The results showed a mean increment of 126 and 122% in inspiratory and expiratory flow resistances, respectively, with the use of N95 respirators. There was also an average reduction of 37% in air exchange volume with the use of N95 respirators. This is the first reported study that demonstrates quantitatively and objectively the substantial impairment of nasal airflow in terms of increased breathing resistance with the use of N95 respirators on actual human subjects.","Lee, Heow Pueh; Wang, De Yun",The Annals of occupational hygiene,423,12

In those cases, deployment of the second stent through interstices of the first stent could be troublesome because of untoward angular changes in the vascular bifurcation prompted by angular changes resulting from placement of the first stent. Here, we describe a novel application of the buddy wire technique to facilitate Y-configured stenting in middle cerebral artery (MCA) bifurcation aneurysms with unfavorable anatomic configuration. CLINICAL PRESENTATION A 60-year-old man with a left-sided MCA bifurcation aneurysm was treated using the buddy wire technique. In addition to the standard Y-configured stenting procedure, we also inserted a 0.014-inch exchange microguidewire into the superior daughter branch, which more acutely emanated from the sac, to attain a favorable bifurcation configuration before deployment of the stents in the Y configuration. The new technique was successful, and the postprocedural course of the treatment was uneventful. CONCLUSION Use of a buddy wire in MCA bifurcation aneurysms with unfavorable anatomic configurations may be a promising method to facilitate Y-configured stent placement.","Islak, Civan; Kizilkilic, Osman; Kocak, Burak; Saglam, Muzaffer; Yildiz, Bulent; Kocer, Naci",Neurosurgery,423,1

In this study, we aimed to identify the causative pathogens of sepsis in southeast Asia. METHODS In this multinational multicentre cross-sectional study of community-acquired sepsis and severe sepsis, we prospectively recruited children (age ≥30 days and <18 years) and adults (age ≥18 years) at 13 public hospitals in Indonesia (n=3), Thailand (n=4), and Vietnam (n=6). Hospitalised patients with suspected or documented community-acquired infection, with at least three diagnostic criteria for sepsis according to the Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2012, and within 24 h of admission were enrolled. Blood from every patient, and nasopharyngeal swab, urine, stool, and cerebrospinal fluid, if indicated, were collected for reference diagnostic tests to identify causative pathogens. We report causative pathogens of sepsis and 28-day mortality. We also estimate mortality associated with enrolment with severe sepsis. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02157259. FINDINGS From Dec 16, 2013, to Dec 14, 2015, 4736 patients were screened and 1578 patients (763 children and 815 adults) were enrolled. Dengue viruses (n=122 [8%]), Leptospira spp (n=95 [6%]), rickettsial pathogens (n=96 [6%]), Escherichia coli (n=76 [5%]), and influenza viruses (n=65 [4%]) were commonly identified in both age groups; whereas Plasmodium spp (n=12 [1%]) and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (n=3 [0·2%]) were rarely observed. Emerging pathogens identified included hantaviruses (n=28 [2%]), non-typhoidal Salmonella spp (n=21 [1%]), Streptococcus suis (n=18 [1%]), Acinetobacter spp (n=12 [1%]), and Burkholderia pseudomallei (n=5 [<1%]). 28-day mortality occurred in 14 (2%) of 731 children with known statuses and 108 (13%) of 804 adults. Severe sepsis was identified on enrolment in 194 (28%) of 731 children and 546 (68%) of 804 adults, and was associated with increased mortality (adjusted odds ratio 5·3, 95% CI 2·7-10·4; p<0·001).

The only treatment that reduces the mortality rate associated with this syndrome is lung protective ventilation, which requires sedation of patients. Sedation in critical care units is usually induced intravenously, although there is reason to believe that inhaled anaesthetics are a suitable alternative. Sevoflurane has recently been shown to modulate the lung inflammatory response in a model of lung injury more favourably than propofol. OBJECTIVE The goal of this study was to confirm whether or not sevoflurane is more effective than propofol in ameliorating the inflammatory response in an animal model of acute respiratory distress syndrome. DESIGN A prospective, randomised, controlled study. SETTING Research foundation laboratory at the Hospital Clínico Universitario, Valencia, Spain. EXPERIMENTAL ANIMALS Sixteen Landrace/large white crossbred pigs weighing 30 to 45 kg. INTERVENTIONS Animals were allocated randomly to one of two groups: one sedated with intravenous propofol 5 to 7 mg kg h (group P) and the other with sevoflurane, administered using an AnaConDa device to obtain an end-tidal concentration of 1.5% (group S). Monitoring, lung protective ventilation and anaesthetic management were identical in both groups. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The PaO2/FiO2 ratio and cytokine concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavage specimens were determined at 10, 150 and 240 min after confirmation of acute respiratory distress syndrome (PaO2/FiO2 <26.7 kPa). RESULTS At 240 min, median and interquartile range (IQR) concentrations of cytokines in bronchial lavage specimens in group S were lower than those in group P [interleukin-1β (IL-1β) 53, IQR 16-140 vs. 311, IQR 183-637 pg ml, P = 0.04; tumour necrosis factor-α 347, IQR 161-433 vs. 552, IQR 475-649 pg ml, P = 0.04; and IL-6 101, IQR 76-282 vs. 580, IQR 369-701 pg ml, P = 0.03]. The polymorphonuclear neutrophil count was also lower in group S (P = 0.007), which also had a higher PaO2/FiO2 ratio. TRIAL REGISTRATION GE-015/09. CONCLUSION In an animal model of acute respiratory distress syndrome, sevoflurane ameliorates the lung inflammatory response and improves oxygenation to a greater extent than propofol.","Ferrando, Carlos; Aguilar, Gerardo; Piqueras, Laura; Soro, Marina; Moreno, Joaquin; Belda, Francisco J",European journal of anaesthesiology,423,1

Several single-center studies have reported worse outcomes, but no state-level data is available. We aimed to determine the statewide effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the presentation and management of pediatric appendicitis patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients < 18 years old with acute appendicitis at four tertiary pediatric hospitals in California between March 19, 2020 to September 19, 2020 (COVID-era) were compared to a pre-COVID cohort (March 19, 2019 to September 19, 2019). The primary outcome was the rate of perforated appendicitis. Secondary outcomes were symptom duration prior to presentation, and rates of non-operative management. RESULTS Rates of perforated appendicitis were unchanged (40.4% of 592 patients pre-COVID versus 42.1% of 606 patients COVID-era, P = 0.17). The median symptom duration was 2 days in both cohorts (P = 0.90). Computed tomography (CT) use rose from 39.8% pre-COVID to 49.4% during COVID (P = 0.002). Non-operative management increased during the pandemic (8.8% pre-COVID versus 16.2% COVID-era, P < 0.0001). Hospital length of stay (LOS) was longer (2 days pre-COVID versus 3 days during COVID, P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS Pediatric perforated appendicitis rates did not rise during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic in California in this multicenter study, and there were no delays in presentation noted. There was a higher rate of CT scans, non-operative management, and longer hospital lengths of stay.","Theodorou, Christina M; Beres, Alana L; Nguyen, Michelle; Castle, Shannon L; Faltermeier, Claire; Shekherdimian, Shant; Tung, Christine; DeUgarte, Daniel A; Brown, Erin G",The Journal of surgical research,423,5

Early and fast detection of COVID-19 from infected individuals is critical to limit its spreading. Here, we report an innovative approach to detect the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleocapsid (N) protein by combining DNA/RNA oligomers as aptamers and a graphene oxide (GO) coated optical microfiber as a sensor system. The DNA/RNA aptamers can effectively capture the SARS-CoV-2 N protein in vitro, with the GO coated optical microfiber aptasensor for real-time monitoring of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein. Due to the extremely high surface-to-volume ratio and excellent optical and biochemical properties of the GO surface layer, the fixing effect of the microfiber surface is significantly improved and the lowest limit of detection (LOD) is 6.25 × 10-19 M. Furthermore, in order to prove the feasibility of this sensing method in clinical applications, we use this sensor to detect the N protein mixed in fetal bovine serum (FBS) samples. The experimental results show that the biosensor can quickly and effectively detect the N protein (1 × 10-9 M) in a complex sample matrix within 3 minutes. These findings suggest that this approach can be utilized for quantitative monitoring of coronavirus particles due to its high sensitivity, which can help to quickly exclude patients who do not have the infection. Collectively, the optical microfiber sensor system could be expected to become an important platform for the diagnosis of coronavirus due to its simple detection scheme and easy miniaturization.","Jia, Hao; Zhang, Ao; Yang, Yuquan; Cui, Yaqi; Xu, Jianrong; Jiang, Hewei; Tao, Shengce; Zhang, Dawei; Zeng, Heping; Hou, Zhaoyuan; Feng, Jijun",Lab on a chip,423,30

It is singularly true for wide-neck bifurcation aneurysms (WNBA) as bifurcation branches often arise from the aneurysm neck. To overcome these difficulties, several approaches are available to treat both ruptured and unruptured aneurysms (balloon-assisted coiling and intra-aneurysmal flow disruption), while some techniques are essentially restricted to unruptured aneurysms due to the need of concomitant use of antiplatelet medications (stent-assisted coiling and flow diversion). Several ways of performing balloon-assisted coiling have been proposed for WNBA. Two stent-assisted techniques are available for WNBA (Y-stenting and the waffle-cone technique), but these techniques have yet to be evaluated in large, prospective series. Off-label use of flow diverters in WNBA has been proposed but efficacy has still to be established, and the technique presents unique potential safety issues (the potential modifications of bifurcation branches covered by the flow diverter) that has to be assessed. Intrasaccular flow disruption devices are promising tools for the endovascular treatment of WNBA.

STUDY DESIGN Case series with chart review. SETTING A single tertiary care institution. SUBJECTS AND METHODS A chart review was performed for patients aged ≤5 years who underwent tracheostomy. Extracted data included demographic data, indication for tracheostomy, age at tracheostomy and decannulation, comorbidities, and surgical complications. Records were searched for documentation of early decannulation failure (within 1 month of decannulation) or late failure (within 1 year). RESULTS Forty patients with a tracheostomy aged ≤5 years underwent attempted decannulation during the 11-year study period. Seventeen patients were excluded from the study for documentation of nonprotocol decannulation. The final study population of 23 patients underwent a total of 27 decannulations, 26 of which were performed by protocol. Of the 26 protocol decannulations, 22 were successful, for a failure rate of 15%. CONCLUSION Twenty-six protocol decannulations were attempted among 23 patients, 4 of which were unsuccessful for an overall failure rate of 15%. This result is consistent with rates reported in other published decannulation protocols.

Patients with HAIs have prolonged hospital stays, and have high morbidity and mortality, thus adding economic burden on the healthcare system. For various reasons, in low-to-middle income countries (LMICs), the scale of the problem is huge; each year, many people die from HAIs. In this review, epidemiology of HAIs and infection prevention and control measures in ICUs is discussed, with especial emphasis on LMICs. High rates of HAIs caused by multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) are serious problems in ICUs in LMICs. In view of increasing prevalence of MDROs, LMICs should establish effective IPC infrastructure, appoint IPC teams, and provide adequate training and resources. These resources to establish and appoint IPC teams can be released by avoiding ritualistic, wasteful, and unsafe IPC practices, and by diverting resources to implement basic IPC measures, including early detection of infection, isolation of patients, application of appropriate IPC precautions, adherence to hand hygiene, and implementation of HAIs care bundles and basic evidence-based practices.","Alp, Emine; Damani, Nizam",Journal of infection in developing countries,423,28

Maintaining the integrity and barrier function of the lung epithelium requires complex interactions of multiple cell lineages. Elucidating the cellular players and their regulation mechanisms provides fundamental information to deepen understanding about the responses and contributions of lung stem cells. This Review focuses on advances in our understanding of mammalian alveolar epithelial stem cell subpopulations and discusses insights about the regeneration-specific cell status of alveolar epithelial stem cells. We also consider how these advances can inform our understanding of post-injury lung repair processes and lung diseases.,"Wu, Huijuan; Tang, Nan",Development,423,23

We sought to ascertain the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare delivery for pediatric patients with IF. METHODS A 20-question survey was administered to members of the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition Intestinal Rehabilitation (IR) Special Interest Group. Input values were ""yes"" and ""no,"" along with a free-text response. Following a 10-day open survey period, data were divided into cohorts based on patient population size and disease burden by state. Analysis was then performed using the χ2 test application. RESULTS Responses from 29 centers were included in analysis. Centers that followed >50 patients on parenteral nutrition (PN) were more likely to have social workers present in telemedicine visits and observed more central line difficulties among families. Centers located in states with <40,000 reported cases of COVID-19 saw patients less frequently and were more likely to withhold changes to PN prescriptions. Additionally, the survey revealed a significant degree of financial hardship and food insecurity among families. CONCLUSION Many aspects of pediatric IF healthcare delivery have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, both for care providers and caregivers. Despite the availability of telemedicine, IR centers should remain attentive to the global needs of the pediatric IF patient, as well as their families.","Galloway, David P; Mathis, Michelle S; Wilkinson, Linda T; Venick, Robert S; Wendel, Danielle; Cole, Conrad R; Martin, Colin A",JPEN.

This study aimed to assess the use of DNase and RNase coupled to qPCR and RT-qPCR, respectively, to detect intact particles of human adenoviruses (HAdVs), HNoV GI and GII and HAV in fresh produce. Different concentrations of DNase and RNase were tested to optimize the degradation of free DNA and RNA from inactivated HAdV and murine norovirus (MNV), respectively. Results indicated that 10 µg/ml of RNase was able to degrade more than 4 log10 (99.99%) of free RNA, and 1 U of DNase degraded the range of 0.84-2.5 log10 of free DNA depending on the fresh produce analysed. The treatment with nucleases coupled to (RT)-qPCR was applied to detect potential infectious virus in organic lettuce, green onions and strawberries collected in different seasons. As a result, no intact particles of HNoV GI and GII were detected in the 36 samples analysed, HAdV was found in one sample and HAV was present in 33.3% of the samples, without any reasonable distribution pattern among seasons. In conclusion, RT-qPCR preceded by RNase treatment of eluted samples from fresh produce is a good alternative to detect undamaged RNA viruses and therefore, potential infectious viruses. Moreover, this study provides data about the prevalence of enteric viruses in organic fresh produce from Brazil.","Marti, Elisabet; Ferrary-Américo, Monique; Barardi, Célia Regina Monte",Food and environmental virology,423,29

Numerous disaster-type ventilators are available, but few evaluations have been performed. OBJECTIVE To compare simple, lightweight, and handy ventilators that could be used in the initial care of patients with respiratory distress. METHODS We bench-tested 4 volume-cycled ventilators (Carevent ALS, EPV100, Pneupac VR1, and Medumat Easy) and 2 pressure-cycled ventilators (Oxylator EMX and VAR-Plus). We studied their general physical characteristics, sonometry, gas consumption, technical performance, ergonomy, and user-friendliness. With a test lung we assessed performance at F(IO(2)) of 0.50 and 1.0, set compliance of 30, 70, and 120 mL/cm H(2)O, and set resistance of 5, 10, and 20 cm H(2)O/L/s. To study user-friendliness and ergonomy we conducted, in randomized order, 7 or 8 objective, quantitative tests and 2 subjective tests. RESULTS Compliance and resistance strongly affected tidal volume with the pressure-cycled ventilators (from 418 ± 49 mL to 1,377 ± 444 mL with the VAR-Plus, at the lowest pressure level), whereas the volume-cycled ventilators provided a consistent tidal volume in the face of changing test lung characteristics. CONCLUSIONS We are concerned that the pressure-cycled ventilators did not provide a consistent tidal volume, and under certain conditions the volume delivered would be unsafe (too large or too small). Most of the volume-cycled ventilators proved to be technically efficient and reliable. Their reliability, portability, and ease of use could make them valuable in natural disasters and mass-casualty events.","L'Her, Erwan; Roy, Annie",Respiratory care,423,1

General anesthesia was induced in eight healthy adult male Beagles. A Swan-Ganz catheter was placed in the pulmonary artery via the jugular vein for cardiac output measurements. A Foley urethral catheter was placed to monitor transvesical IAP. A 10 mm balloon blunt-tip trocar was inserted into the retroperitoneal space. With a fixed respiratory rate and tidal volume by mechanical ventilation, insufflation pressure was sequentially increased from 0 to 10 mmHg in 5 mmHg increments, followed by desufflation. All variables were measured before insufflation, 5 min after the establishment of each insufflation pressure, and after desufflation. At 10 mmHg, the IAP was nearly equal to insufflation pressure. Cardiopulmonary function was not compromised at any point, although the cardiac index (CI), heart rate, mean arterial pressure (MAP), and mean pulmonary arterial pressure increased within normal ranges. End-tidal CO2 concentration, arterial CO2 partial pressure, and oxygen delivery index (DO2I) increased, whereas pH decreased, at 10 mmHg. CI, MAP, and DO2I did not recover to baseline after decompression. Thus, retroperitoneal CO2 insufflation up to 10 mmHg is well tolerated by mechanically ventilated dogs positioned in sternal recumbency with the abdomen unsupported, although sympathetic changes may occur with an insufflation pressure increase.","Son, Hyunglak; Ko, Jonghyeok; Jeong, Junemoe; Lee, Sungin; Sihn, Dongmin; Kweon, Oh-Kyeong; Kim, Wan Hee",The Journal of veterinary medical science,423,1

The role of minimally invasive surgical techniques in recurrent CDH remains undefined. The purpose of this study was to evaluate our early experience with thoracoscopic repair compared with traditional open repair in children with recurrent CDH. SUBJECTS AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed all recurrent Bochdalek CDH cases (n=24) managed at a single tertiary-care referral center between January 1990 and March 2011. Children who underwent thoracoscopic repair for recurrent CDH were identified, and their data were compared by the unpaired t test and the two-sided Fisher's exact test, as appropriate, with those of children who underwent open repair. Significance was defined as P<.05. RESULTS Thoracoscopic repair was attempted in 6 (25%) children with recurrent CDH. Four (67%) repairs were successfully completed without conversion to an open procedure. The mean age at thoracoscopic repair was 11.5 months (range, 8.1-16.1 months). The mean operative time was 191 minutes (range, 94-296 minutes), and all children were extubated within 24 hours. The mean hospital length of stay was 3.75 days (range, 1-6 days). There were no deaths or subsequent recurrences after a mean follow-up of 26.5 months (range, 14.3-41.3 months). There were no statistical differences in any of the measured outcome variables when compared with the open repair group. CONCLUSIONS Our initial experience suggests that thoracoscopic repair is a feasible alternative to open repair in selected children with recurrent Bochdalek diaphragmatic hernias.","Kunisaki, Shaun M; Powelson, Ian A; Bruch, Steven W; Jarboe, Marcus D; Geiger, James D; Mychaliska, George B",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

We sought to assess the accuracy of HAS as a marker of arterial obstruction by thrombus. METHODS The Third International Stroke Trial (IST-3) was a randomized controlled trial testing the use of intravenous thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke in patients who did not clearly meet the prevailing license criteria. Some participating IST-3 centers routinely performed CT or MR angiography at baseline. One reader assessed all relevant scans independently, blinded to all other data; we checked observer reliability. We combined IST-3 data with a systematic review and meta-analysis of all studies that assessed the accuracy of HAS using angiography (any modality). RESULTS IST-3 had 273 patients with baseline CT or MR angiography and was the largest study of HAS accuracy. The meta-analysis (n=902+273=1175, including IST-3) found sensitivity and specificity of HAS for arterial obstruction on angiography to be 52% and 95%, respectively. HAS was more commonly identified in proximal than distal arteries (47% versus 37%; P=0.015), and its sensitivity increased with thinner CT slices (r=-0.73; P=0.001). Neither extent of obstruction nor time after stroke influenced HAS accuracy. CONCLUSIONS When present in acute ischemic stroke, HAS indicates a high likelihood of arterial obstruction, but its absence indicates only a 50/50 chance of normal arterial patency. Thin-slice CT improves sensitivity of HAS detection. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION URL http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN25765518.

This study aimed to compare 6-month changes in the FR-10 vs. IDEAL score among young adults with BMI ≥25 to <40kg/m(2) enrolled in a behavioral weight loss intervention at the University of Pittsburgh (2010-12). Medians [25th, 75th percentiles] are reported. Weight decreased by 8kg [-12, -4] among 335 participants. Of 7 possible points, IDEAL score was 4 [3, 4] at baseline, improved (i.e., increased) by 1 [0, 2] over 6months, and improved in 64.2% and worsened in 6.6% of participants (p<0.001). IDEAL classification of BMI, physical activity, total cholesterol, blood pressure and glucose improved (all p<0.001), but not of smoking or diet (both p≥0.05). FR-10 was <1% at baseline for 88.1% of participants and changed in few participants (improved, i.e. decreased, in 7.5%, worsened in 1.8%, p<0.001). Among young adults with overweight or obesity enrolled in a weight loss intervention, IDEAL detected positive changes in a majority of participants while the FR-10 did not.

However, the molecular causes behind FF remain largely unknown. Mass spectrometry is a powerful technique to identify and quantify proteins across samples; however, no study so far has used it to dissect the proteomic signature of sperm with FF after ICSI. OBJECTIVE To investigate whether sperm samples from patients suffering repetitive FF after ICSI display alterations in their protein content. MATERIAL AND METHODS Seventeen infertile men were included: 5 patients presented FF in ≥3 consecutive ICSI cycles, while 12 patients had a fertilization rate >75% (controls). Individual sperm samples were subjected to 2D-LC-MS/MS. Both conventional and novel statistical approaches were used to identify differentially abundant proteins. Additionally, analysis of mitochondrial and proteasomal abundance and activity were performed, using western blot, FACS analysis of JC-1 staining and AMC-peptide fluorometric assay. RESULTS Four proteins presented lower abundance (FMR1NB, FAM209B, RAB2B, PSMA1) in the FF group compared to controls, while five mitochondrial proteins presented higher abundance in FF (DLAT, ATP5H, SLC25A3, SLC25A6, FH) (p<0.05). The altered abundance of mitochondrial DLAT and proteasomal PSMA1 was corroborated by Western-Blot. Of relevance, novel stable-protein pair analysis identified 73 correlations comprising 28 proteins within controls, while different mitochondrial proteins (i.e. PDHA2, PHB2, ATP5F1D) lost >50% of these correlations in specific FF samples pointing out specific mitochondrial deregulations. DISCUSSION This is the first proteomic analysis of sperm from patients who resulted in fertilization failure after ICSI. The altered proteins, most of them related to mitochondrial function, could help to identify diagnostic/prognostic markers of fertilization failure and could further dissect the molecular paternal contribution to reach successful fertilization. CONCLUSION Sperm samples from patients with FF after ICSI present altered abundance of different proteins, including mainly mitochondrial proteins.","Torra-Massana, Marc; Jodar, Meritxell; Barragán, Montserrat; Soler-Ventura, Ada; Delgado-Dueñas, David; Rodríguez, Amelia; Oliva, Rafael; Vassena, Rita",Andrology,423,19

Image-based computational fluid dynamics models have suggested associations between hemodynamics and intracranial aneurysm rupture, albeit with conflicting findings regarding wall shear stress. We propose that the ""high-versus-low wall shear stress"" controversy is a manifestation of the complexity of aneurysm pathophysiology, and both high and low wall shear stress can drive intracranial aneurysm growth and rupture. Low wall shear stress and high oscillatory shear index trigger an inflammatory-cell-mediated pathway, which could be associated with the growth and rupture of large, atherosclerotic aneurysm phenotypes, while high wall shear stress combined with a positive wall shear stress gradient trigger a mural-cell-mediated pathway, which could be associated with the growth and rupture of small or secondary bleb aneurysm phenotypes. This hypothesis correlates disparate intracranial aneurysm pathophysiology with the results of computational fluid dynamics in search of more reliable risk predictors.","Meng, H; Tutino, V M; Xiang, J; Siddiqui, A",AJNR.

DESIGN Single-center, retrospective review (Canadian Task Force classification II-3). SETTING University hospital. PATIENTS Thirty-eight women diagnosed with interstitial pregnancy, which developed after 10,143 ET cycles, managed in our center between April 2011 and April 2014. INTERVENTIONS All 38 cases of interstitial pregnancy were managed by laparoscopic cornuostomy or cornual repair. No patient was converted to laparotomy. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Of 43 cases of interstitial pregnancy, 38 were managed in our department. The overall incidence of interstitial pregnancy was .4% per ET cycle (43/10 143), or .8% per pregnancy (43/5297), but comprising 35.5% of all ectopic pregnancy cases. The risk factors for interstitial pregnancy included tubal infertility, cleavage ET, and frozen ET. Twenty-seven subjects (71.1%) had undergone bilateral salpingectomy. Among the 38 cases, 27 were intact, with no persistent ectopic pregnancy after surgery, but there were 3 cases (28.3%) of persistent pregnancy in the 11 ruptured cases. Among the 38 subjects, 15 conceived again with 14 live births and 1 ongoing pregnancy, without uterine rupture. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic cornuostomy or cornual repair appears to be an effective treatment in intact cases, although it sometimes needs to be combined with methotrexate therapy in ruptured cases complicated by persistent disease.","Wang, Jieyu; Huang, Dong; Lin, Xiaona; Saravelos, Sotiris H; Chen, Jianmin; Zhang, Xiao; Li, TinChiu; Zhang, Songying",Journal of minimally invasive gynecology,423,31

Treatment with AnxA12-26, once a day, from day 3-60 after scaffold implantation improved the take of the implant, induced vessels formation, enhanced gene and protein levels of the vascular growth factor-A (VEGF-A) and fibroblast influx into allograft tissue. It also decreased pro- while increasing anti-inflammatory cytokines. The pro-angiogenic activity of AnxA12-26 was corroborated by topical application of AnxA12-26 on the subcutaneous tissue of mice. Moreover, treatment of human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs) with AnxA12-26 improved proliferation, shortened cycle, increased migration and actin polymerization similarly to those evoked by VEGF-A. The peptide treatment instead only potentiated the tube formation induced by VEGF-A. Collectively, our data showed that AnxA12-26 treatment favors the tissue regeneration after skin grafting by avoiding exacerbated inflammation and improving the angiogenesis process.","Lacerda, Jéssica Zani; Drewes, Carine Cristiane; Mimura, Kallyne Kioko Oliveira; Zanon, Caroline de Freitas; Ansari, Tahera; Gil, Cristiane Damas; Greco, Karin Vicente; Farsky, Sandra Helena Poliselli; Oliani, Sonia Maria",Frontiers in pharmacology,423,29

Under the more than extraordinary conditions of the ongoing worldwide coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, a total of 161,817 procedures were submitted to the registry. A total of 92,809 of these operations are summarized as heart surgery procedures in a classical sense. The unadjusted in-hospital survival rate for the 29,444 isolated coronary artery bypass grafting procedures (relationship on-/off-pump 3.6:1) was 97.2%. For the 35,469 isolated heart valve procedures, (17,471 transcatheter interventions included), the survival rate was 96.7%. Concerning short- and long-term circulatory support, a total of 2,852 extracorporeal life support/extracorporeal membrane oxygenation implantations, respectively, 843 assist device implantations (left/right/biventricular assist device, total artificial device), were registered.

A concise synthetic route to access tricepyridinium analogs was thus designed and four N-alkyl compounds were generated in addition to the natural product. Biological analysis of these compounds revealed that they display remarkable selectivity towards clinically-relevant Gram-positive bacteria exceeding that of commercially-available QACs such as cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) and benzalkonium chloride (BAC) while having little to no hemolytic activity. Molecular modeling studies revealed that tricepyridinium and shorter-chain N-alkyl analogs may preferentially bind to the QacR transcription factor leading to potential activation of the QAC resistance pathway found in MRSA; however, our newly synthesized analogs are able to overcome this liability.","Garrison, Michelle A; Mahoney, Andrew R; Wuest, William M",ChemMedChem,423,31

We explore a potential misinterpretation of trivariate scatterplots, which we call the weighted average illusion, where locations of larger and darker points are given more weight toward x- and y-mean estimates. This systematic bias is sensitive to a designer's choice of size or lightness ranges mapped onto the data. In this paper, we quantify this bias against varying size/lightness ranges and data correlations. We discuss possible explanations for its cause by measuring attention given to individual data points using a vision science technique called the centroid method. Our work illustrates how ensemble processing mechanisms and mental shortcuts can significantly distort visual summaries of data, and can lead to misjudgments like the demonstrated weighted average illusion.","Hong, Matt-Heun; Witt, Jessica K; Szafir, Danielle Albers",IEEE transactions on visualization and computer graphics,423,1

The primary aim of this study was to determine whether vaccine-related side effects following COVID-19 vaccination were associated with an adverse impact on breastfeeding. Secondarily, we sought to determine perceived symptoms in breastfed children and maternal opinion about COVID-19 vaccination. Materials and Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of breastfeeding mothers who underwent COVID-19 vaccination >2 days before the survey. Subjects were recruited through social media and websites. Data included sociodemographic information, vaccine history, maternal and child symptoms, and impact on lactation/breastfeeding. Bivariate statistics (chi-square, Wilcoxon rank sum, and t tests) and multivariable logistic regression models examined the association of vaccine side effects with lactation, symptoms in breastfed children, and maternal opinion on vaccination. Results: Analysis included 4,455 breastfeeding mothers. Maternal postvaccination symptoms were more common after the second dose (p < 0.001). Overall, 77 (1.7%) respondents reported a negative impact on breastfeeding postvaccination, and these mothers were more likely to have experienced fatigue, headache, muscle pain, injection site pain, chills, fever, or allergic reactions. After adjusting for confounding variables, higher odds of an adverse impact on lactation were associated with lower breastfeeding intensity, dose of vaccine, and child symptoms. Even among mothers who reported an adverse impact on breastfeeding, maternal opinion about vaccination and confidence in their decision to receive the COVID-19 vaccine were high. Conclusions: COVID-19 vaccination among breastfeeding mothers resulted in minimal disruption of lactation or adverse impact on the breastfed child. These findings may be considered in vaccination decision-making.","McLaurin-Jiang, Skyler; Garner, Christine D; Krutsch, Kaytlin; Hale, Thomas W",Breastfeeding medicine : the official journal of the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine,423,14

A majority of tumor-promoting kinase signaling pathways feed into the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) extracellular regulated kinase (ERK1/2) pathway. The activation status of ERK1/2 during invasion of MB cells is not known and its implication in invasion control unclear. We established a synthetic kinase activation relocation sensor (SKARS) for the MAPK ERK1/2 pathway in MB cells for real-time measuring of drug response. We used 3D invasion assays and organotypic cerebellum slice culture to test drug effects in a physiologically relevant tissue environment. We found that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), or basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) caused rapid nuclear ERK1/2 activation in MB cells, which persisted for several hours. Concomitant treatment with the BCR/ABL kinase inhibitor dasatinib completely repressed nuclear ERK1/2 activity induced by HGF and EGF but not by bFGF. Increased nuclear ERK1/2 activity correlated positively with speed of invasion. Dasatinib blocked ERK-associated invasion in the majority of cells, but we also observed fast-invading cells with low ERK1/2 activity. These ERK1/2-low, fast-moving cells displayed a rounded morphology, while ERK-high fast-moving cells displayed a mesenchymal morphology. Dasatinib effectively blocked EGF-induced proliferation while it only moderately repressed tissue invasion, indicating that a subset of cells may evade invasion repression by dasatinib through non-mesenchymal motility. Thus, growth factor-induced nuclear activation of ERK1/2 is associated with mesenchymal motility and proliferation in MB cells and can be blocked with the BCR/ABL kinase inhibitor dasatinib.","Schönholzer, Marc Thomas; Migliavacca, Jessica; Alvarez, Elena; Santhana Kumar, Karthiga; Neve, Anuja; Gries, Alexandre; Ma, Min; Grotzer, Michael A; Baumgartner, Martin",Neoplasia,423,20

This makes them more vulnerable to danger and hazards, and they thus have a higher risk of injury. Safety education such as teaching safety rules and tips is vital to prevent children from injuries. Although game-based approaches have the potential to capture children's attention and sustain their interest in learning, whether these new instructional approaches are more effective than traditional approaches in delivering safety messages to children remains uncertain. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study is to test the effectiveness of a game-based intervention in promoting safety knowledge and behaviors among Hong Kong school children in Grades 4-6. It will also examine the potential effect of the game-based intervention on these children's functioning and psychosocial difficulties. METHODS This study comprises the development of a city-based role-playing game Safe City, where players are immersed as safety inspectors to prevent dangerous situations and promote safety behavior in a virtual city environment. The usability and acceptability tests will be conducted with children in Grades 4-6 who will trial the gameplay on a mobile phone. Adjustments will be made based on their feedback. A 4-week randomized controlled trial with children studying in Grades 4-6 in Hong Kong elementary schools will be conducted to assess the effectiveness of the Safe City game-based intervention. In this trial, 504 children will play Safe City, and 504 children will receive traditional instructional materials (electronic and printed safety information). The evaluation will be conducted using both child self-report and parent proxy-report data. Specifically, child safety knowledge and behaviors will be assessed by a questionnaire involving items on knowledge and behaviors, respectively, for home safety, road safety, and sport-related safety; child functioning will be assessed by PedsQL Generic Core Scales; and psychosocial difficulties will be assessed by the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire. These questionnaires will be administered at 3 time points: before, 1 month, and 3 months after the intervention. Game usage statistics will also be reviewed. RESULTS This project was funded in September 2019. The design and development of the Safe City game are currently under way. Recruitment and data collection will begin from September 2020 and will continue up to March 1, 2021. Full analysis will be conducted after the end of the data collection period. CONCLUSIONS If the Safe City game is found to be an effective tool to deliver safety education, it could be used to promote safety in children in the community and upgraded to incorporate more health-related topics to support education and empowerment for the larger public.

Recent studies have shown improvement of survival and quality of life when radiopharmaceuticals were given repeatedly or in combination with chemotherapy. We designed a phase I study combining docetaxel and (186)Re-labelled hydroxyethylidene diphosphonate (HEDP) in men with CRPC and bone metastases to evaluate toxicity. METHODS A dose escalation schedule was designed consisting of four dose levels with a standard dosage of docetaxel (75 mg/m(2) 3-weekly). (186)Re-HEDP was given in increasing activities (1,250 MBq up to 2,500 MBq) after the third and sixth cycle of docetaxel. Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as any grade 4 toxicity lasting more than 7 days or any grade 3 toxicity that did not recover within 10 days. Three patients were planned for each dose level expanding to six if a DLT occurred. RESULTS Fourteen patients were recruited with a median age of 64.6 years. One DLT, grade 3 thrombocytopenia lasting >10 days, occurred at dose level 3 leading to expansion of this group to six. One of these patients had an episode of acute renal failure which resolved. Because of production problems of (186)Re-HEDP dose level 4 was not started. CONCLUSION Combined therapy with docetaxel and (186)Re-HEDP is generally well tolerated in patients with CRPC metastatic to bone. We will conduct a randomized phase II study using three cycles of docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) 3-weekly followed by (188)Re-HEDP 40 MBq/kg body weight, followed by another three cycles of docetaxel 75 mg/m(2), followed by (188)Re-HEDP 20 MBq/kg body weight.","van Dodewaard-de Jong, Joyce M; de Klerk, John M H; Bloemendal, Haiko J; van Bezooijen, Bart P J; de Haas, Marie J; Wilson, Richard H; O'Sullivan, Joe M",European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,423,10

In this context, using NMR spectroscopy, we studied the conformation of dimeric 3CLp from the SARS-CoV-2 and monitored ligand binding, based on NMR signal assignments. We performed a fragment-based screening that led to the identification of 38 fragment hits. Their binding sites showed three hotspots on 3CLp, two in the substrate binding pocket and one at the dimer interface. F01 is a non-covalent inhibitor of the 3CLp and has antiviral activity in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. This study sheds light on the complex structure-function relationships of 3CLp, and constitutes a strong basis to assist in developing potent 3CLp inhibitors.","Cantrelle, François-Xavier; Boll, Emmanuelle; Brier, Lucile; Moschidi, Danai; Belouzard, Sandrine; Landry, Valérie; Leroux, Florence; Dewitte, Frédérique; Landrieu, Isabelle; Dubuisson, Jean; Deprez, Benoit; Charton, Julie; Hanoulle, Xavier",Angewandte Chemie,423,1

Doxorubicin is a common intra-venous chemotherapy used for peritoneal carcinomatosis and for PIPAC. This study evaluated the impact of increased PIPAC intraperitoneal pressure on the distribution and cell penetration of doxorubicin in a sheep model. METHODS Doxorubicin was aerosolized using PIPAC into the peritoneal cavity of 6 ewes (pre-alpes breed): N = 3 with 12 mmHg intraperitoneal pressure (""group 12"") and N = 3 with 20 mmHg (""group 20""). Samples from peritoneum (N = 6), ovarian (N = 1), omentum (N = 1) and caecum (N = 1) were collected for each ewe. The number of doxorubicin positive cells was determined using the ratio between doxorubicine fluorescence-positive cell nuclei (DOXO+) over total number of DAPI positive cell nuclei (DAPI+). Penetration depth (μm) was defined as the distance between the luminal surface and the location of the deepest DOXO+ nuclei over the total number of cell nuclei that were stained with DAPI. Penetration depth (μm) was defined as the distance between the luminal surface and the location of the deepest DOXO+ nuclei. RESULTS DOXO+ nuclei were identified in 87% of samples. All omental samples, directly localized in front of the nebulizer head, had 100% DOXO+ nuclei whereas very few nuclei were DOXO+ for caecum. Distribution patterns were not different between the two groups but penetration depth in ovary and caecum samples was significantly deeper in group 20. CONCLUSIONS This study showed that applying a higher intra-peritoneal pressure during PIPAC treatment leads to a deeper penetration of doxorubicin in ovarian and caecum but does not affect distribution patterns.","Mimouni, Myriam; Richard, Christophe; Adenot, Pierre; Letheule, Martine; Tarrade, Anne; Sandra, Olivier; Dahirel, Michèle; Lilin, Thomas; Lecuelle, Benoit; Gélin, Valérie; Cohen, Julien; Fauconnier, Arnaud; Vialard, François; Huchon, Cyrille; Chavatte-Palmer, Pascale",BMC cancer,423,16

In order to achieve best practices in telemedicine, a platform must be effective and both patients and providers must be satisfied with the use of technology. As telemedicine becomes more widely used in otolaryngology clinics, particularly in the face of the current COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to assess its applicability in this field. The goal of this study was to evaluate existing literature on telemedicine and assess overall image quality, diagnostic concordance, and patient and provider satisfaction with telemedicine technologies. METHODS A systematic review was conducted on PubMed and MEDLINE according to the PRISMA 2009 guidelines for articles from 1982 to 2019 relating to telemedicine in otolaryngology. English language studies with primary or secondary endpoints pertaining to image quality, diagnostic concordance, or patient or provider satisfaction were included. Descriptive studies, editorials, and literature reviews were excluded. RESULTS A total of 32 studies were included in our review. Studies assessing imaging quality and diagnostic concordance reported adequate results but with some heterogeneity. Patient and provider satisfaction were consistently high. CONCLUSIONS The literature supports telemedicine delivery of otorhinolaryngologic care as having achieved high rates of patient and provider satisfaction with adequate image quality and heterogeneity in diagnostic concordance. Variability in diagnostic accuracy was reported, but appears improved given proper clinical context. More standardized studies are needed specific to telemedicine in the field of otolaryngology.","Ning, Anne Y; Cabrera, Claudia I; D'Anza, Brian","The Annals of otology, rhinology, and laryngology",423,23

AIM To evaluate effectiveness, safety and use of tofacitinib in daily practice. METHODS UC patients initiating tofacitinib were prospectively enrolled in 15 hospitals in the Netherlands. Corticosteroid-free clinical remission (short clinical colitis activity index [SCCAI] ≤2), biochemical remission (faecal calprotectin level ≤250 µg/g), combined corticosteroid-free clinical and biochemical remission, predictors of remission, safety outcomes, treatment dose and effect on lipids were determined at weeks 12 and 24. Endoscopic outcomes were evaluated in centres with routine endoscopic evaluation. RESULTS In total, 123 UC patients (95% anti-TNF, 62% vedolizumab and 3% ustekinumab experienced) were followed for a median duration of 24 weeks (interquartile range 12-26). The proportion of patients in corticosteroid-free clinical, biochemical, and combined corticosteroid-free clinical and biochemical remission rate at week 24 was 29% (n: 22/77), 25% (n: 14/57), and 19% (n: 11/57) respectively. Endoscopic remission (Mayo = 0) was achieved in 21% of patients at week 12 (n: 7/33). Prior vedolizumab exposure was associated with reduced clinical remission (odds ratio 0.33, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.11-0.94). At week 24, 33% (n: 14/42) of patients still on tofacitinib treatment used 10 mg twice daily. In total, 33 tofacitinib-related adverse events (89 per 100 patient years) occurred, 7 (6% of total cohort) resulted in discontinuation. Cholesterol, HDL and LDL levels increased during induction treatment by 18% (95% CI 9-26), 18% (95% CI 8-28) and 21% (95% CI 14-39) respectively. CONCLUSION Tofacitinib is an effective treatment for UC after anti-TNF and vedolizumab failure.

This study aimed to provide the epidemiological characteristics of children with COVID-19 throughout China (outside of Hubei Province) based on public data. Methods This was an observational, cross-sectional study. We included a total of 279 diagnosed children based on the data of children infected with SARS-CoV-2 reported by the Health Commission in each province, autonomous region, municipality, or special administrative region in China (outside of Hubei Province) from January 24, 2020 to February 16, 2020. Results The number of newborns (0 days ≤ age ≤28 days), infants (28 days < age ≤1 year), children (1 year < age ≤5 years), and children (5 years < age ≤18 years) accounted for 0.7%, 6.5%, 23.7%, and 69.2% of the total number of infected children, respectively. We found that from January 23, 2020, to January 31, 2020, infected children mainly came from Wuhan, China. After February 3, 2020, family clustering transmission became the main mode of transmission. Conclusions Family clustering transmission is currently the main model of transmission in children.

Entire households were placed in isolation, permitted only to travel locally to access food or medical supplies. The media messaging was resoundingly clear: stay at home. This contemporary context contributes to an analysis of sculptor Michael Parekowhai's The Lighthouse: Tu Whenua-a-Kura (2017), a full-scale model of a State House building typology. State Houses have been lauded as symbols of Aotearoa's ongoing commitment to the principles of egalitarianism. First produced in the 1930s under the leadership of Michael Joseph Savage's Labour government, they were intended to house those unable to afford their own homes. However, in recent years this form of social housing and, in particular, those who have access to it have been the subject of vociferous political debate. A current housing shortage has exacerbated matters as exponential increases in accommodation costs have coincided with increases in homeless numbers in the city. These developments make Parekowhai's public sculpture particularly timely. Sited at the terminus of Queens Wharf on the Waitemata Harbour in Tamaki Makaurau (Auckland), the sculpture contains a single room and a single man: the eighteenth-century English explorer Captain James Cook. He is larger than life-size and adopts a penitent deportment. Cook's heroic legacy has been questioned by revisionist historians and Maori scholars who have identified a plethora of negative impacts colonization had and continues to have on indigenous communities. Cook is now under house arrest, quarantined in a prototypical State House, appearing to reflect on his actions. This paper examines how the artist assiduously reinvents this housing typology as a beacon on a prime piece of real estate. The familiarity of the exterior form is belied by the sculpture's provocative interior contents, where the artist manipulates an elaborate suite of figurative and abstract forms rendered in an array of dazzling surface treatments to shed light, both literally and metaphorically on troubling aspects of our colonial history and access to the provision of land and housing in Aotearoa. Here, at the end of the wharf, we lose our footing;we have to consider where we stand in relation to our colonial past and our contemporary relationship to whenua (land). As calamitous events unfold on the global stage that make us all turn toward our domestic interiors, the conceptual ideas that underpin The Lighthouse: Tu Whenua-a-Kura make one consider what it means to stay at home now in Aotearoa.","Carley, R.",Interiors-Design Architecture Culture,423,2

Given the time limitations (due to their heavy workloads) and need to minimize face-to-face interventions (in order to avoid contagions), psychological interventions for FHCWs should be as brief and remote as possible. Objective To evaluate the usability and clarity of evidence-based psycho-educational videos to prevent B&CF, to deal with uncooperative, hostile, and anxious patients and relatives, and to use personal protective equipment (PPE), from the perspective of Mexican FLHCWs. Method Based on a convenience sampling by intensity approach, videos were distributed requesting feedback based on specific questions through WhatsApp to FLHCWs. Field notes were used to triangulate the information. Results Content analysis of feedback from a final sample of 24 participants ‒75% women, 42 ± 8.4 years old‒ yielded three general thematic categories and seven subthemes: 1. content evaluation, which included three subthemes: utility, pertinence, and practicality; 2. dissemination and other needs, with two subcategories: willingness to share and receive more videos (other needs); and 3. format aspects, also comprising two subthemes: attractiveness and duration. All participants found the videos content very beneficial, relevant, and applicable to the workplace and even in their everyday personal and family life, and were willing to share them and to receive more videos on other issues, including strategies to manage problems related to isolation.

The spectrum of severity ranged from standard hospitalization to pediatric intensive care unit management. There is no specific activity score that predicts whether this hyperinflammatory state will be severe or result in mortality in pediatric patients. There are activity scores used in KD and other vasculitis such as Kobayashi score (KS) and Pediatric Vasculitis Activity Score (PVAS) that determine the severity of the disease in children. Objectives: Based on the clinical similarity of MIS-C to these disease groups, we wanted to evaluate the performance of these disease activity scores. Also, we aimed to identify the factors associated with the disease severity of patients with MISC Methods: We retrospectively enrolled a single-center cohort of 45 consecutive pediatric patients with MISC admitted to Umraniye Training and Resrach Hospital, Pediatric Rheumatology Clinic, Istanbul, Turkey, from April 20 to December 31, 2020. Medical information of each patient including demographic data, clinical characteristics, laboratory results, and outcomes was extracted retrospectively through review of electronic medical records. We analyzed all score systems including KS, PVAS, NLR, cHIS, and C-reactive protein/albumin ratio (CAR) as assessment factors for diagnosis for severe disease and evaluation of disease activity in MISC. All scores were compared between two groups and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to evaluate diagnostic utility. Results: We reported 45 patients (10 female, 35male) with MISC. Their mean age was 9.65±4.93 years (7 months-18 years). All patients had fever (median 4 days), 71 % patients had acute gastrointestinal symptoms, 37.8 % of patient's conjunctivitis and only 5 patients had respiratory findings at admission. Twenty-four (46.7%) patients met criteria for classic KD. Macrophage activation syndrome and myocardial dysfunction with or without cardiogenic shock were seen 14 and 10 patients respectively. All the patients had positive serology for SARSCoV-2, abnormal complete blood counts and coagulation tests, and elevated inflammatory markers. We divided the disease severity into a moderate or severe group based on admission on intensive care unit (ICU). There were 15 patients with severe illness (33%). The median age of these patients was significantly older (11.3 years vs 9.16 years, p=0.05). The median hospital stay period was 10 days. The median need for intensive care was on the first day (1-14th days), and the median lasted 5 (1-9) days. The majority of MISC patients were on Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) (89%), and corticosteroid (73.3%). A total of 12 patients received anakinra. In the severe group, all patients had higher values of KD, PVAS, NLR, cHIS, and CAR than the patients in moderate group. For severe MISC, the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.864 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.729-1) for the PVAS, 0.911 (95% CI, 0.827-0.995) for the NLR, and 0.853 (95% CI, 0.744-0.963) for the CAR, with optimal cut-off values of 3.5, 9.05, and 4.86, respectively. Thirty-eight (84.4%) of the 45 patients met two or more cHIS criteria at the time of their hospitalization;39% of these patients were identified as severe group (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.27-2.13, p=0.04). At the time of diagnosis, 29 patients with a Kobayashi score greater than 4 were detected, of which 15 required intensive care (OR 2.07, 95% CI 1.42-3.0, p=0.00). Conclusion: This study demonstrated that both inflammatory scores (CAR and NLR) and disease activity scores (KS, PVAS and cHIS) can be used to aid the assessment for severity of MISC.","Sözeri, B.; Çaǧlayan, Ş Akyol A.; Ulu, K.; Coşkuner, T.; Hasbal Akkuş, C.; Demir, F.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,423,6

During COVID‐19 pandemic, school leaders faced challenges to prioritise and balance ever‐changing government policy advice with the limitations of school buildings, the welfare of students and staff, and the needs of communities, a task made complicated by the methods of communication used by government. By surveying and interviewing headteachers, senior leaders and governors, this article identifies the reactions and responses of school leaders who construct and enact policy in the context of COVID‐19 pandemic. The article addresses the nature of, and factors affecting, pressures school leaders feel in authoring and implementing policy. These pressures are non‐trivial and increase tension in already highly stressful work. The report draws on data collected from a randomised, stratified sample of primary and secondary school leaders from across England in early June 2020, during the time of national lockdown and remote learning. Findings suggest quality, quantity and frequency of top‐down communication contributed to school leader stress, while horizontal communication and collaboration between school leaders and across school communities supported leaders during rapid change. We recommend that government and the Department of Education strengthen and streamline stressful communication systems while building cooperative communities, mitigating against the challenges identified by school leaders during the COVID‐19 pandemic.

In this case, the analysis focused on the use of natural light in buildings with all façades made of glass. Buildings designed with the criterion of regenerative sustainability, such as glass buildings, consider not only energy efficiency and the use of renewable and/or alternative energies, but also the improvement of the health and well-being of users—very important factors during an era in which the time spent at home has been increased due to the COVID-19 pandemic (disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus). This experimental research was based on the analysis of data collected during a full year of monitoring of two scale models of Farnsworth House, a house with glass façades in all of its orientations. The results allowed us to conclude that these passive elements must be taken into account in the initial design of a building;a solar control sheet is also advisable in this type of glass building because it greatly reduces the illuminance inside the spaces, and the use of overhangs distributes the illuminance inside the rooms more evenly. In addition, the use of scale models provides a more accurate view of the parameters related to light energy.","Aguilera-Benito, Patricia Piña-Ramírez Carolina Varela-Lujan Sheila",Sustainability,423,1

The vast spreading of COVID-19 has already challenged the healthcare system and economy of the world. Every country is now putting the best efforts to develop its standards, strategies, and policies to fight against this pandemic. Therefore, a huge amount of research grants is allocated for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 globally. Objective: Scientists/researchers around the world are working in different fields, i.e., biological, physical, and chemical sciences, and have collaborated for an effective outcome to combat this pandemic. In light of the above-mentioned challenges, the researchers of the nanotechnology community can also contribute significantly in this direction. Results: As team members of the nanotechnology community, we suggest various research targets that can be designed/improved, optimized, and developed by nanotechnologists. These research targets include Point-of-care diagnostics (POCD), Surveillance and monitoring, Therapeutics, Vaccine development, Improving existing drugs with potential therapeutic applications, Developing antiviral nanocoating/antimicrobial spray-based coating for PPE, Magnetic nanoparticles and viral RNA (Ribonucleic acid), and Rapid detection kits. Conclusion: It can be concluded that multiple areas, such as the development of nano-biosensor based diagnostic technology (capable to produce fast and accurate results), development of nano encapsulated drugs/vaccines or other efficient systems, testing/improving existing drugs with potential therapeutic applications, developing antiviral nanocoating/antimicrobial spray-based coating for PPE, etc., need immediate attention.","Tyagi, P.

The authors investigated how students experienced programming and the role of students' perceptions of parental support in their self-reported engagement in HE and PA. Methods: PA and HE curricula were provided across 15 schools over 12 weeks. Students (N = 879, M-age = 12.12 years, 63% female) completed a survey evaluating the value and perceptions around programmatic aspects as well as their self-reported engagement in HE and PA. Results: Multiple regression analyses revealed positive relationships between parental support for PA and student engagement, as well as positive relationships between students' self-efficacy and HE behaviors. Conclusion: Findings indicate that students utilized virtual HE and PA programming and that parent support helped to facilitate engagement in PA and HE behaviors beyond the school setting.","Barcelona, J.; Centeio, E.; Arvidson, P.; Hijazi, K.",Journal of Teaching in Physical Education,423,1

In this study, participants immunized 6-8 months earlier with a primary series of two doses of 50 or 100 g of mRNA-1273 were administered a booster injection of 50 g of mRNA-1273. Neutralizing antibody levels at one month after the booster were 1.7-fold higher than those one-month post primary series second injection meeting the prespecified criteria for noninferiority, and indicating an immune memory response. The reactogenicity after the booster dose was similar to that after the second dose in the primary series of two doses of mRNA-1273 (50 or 100 g) with no serious adverse events reported in the one-month follow-up period.

The new situation is an occasion to reflect on the value of life and health. While adjusting to functioning in the era of the epidemic, health decisions began to emerge, which had been considered unimaginable before. Information about the lack of access to basic protective and emergency equipment, cancelled procedures, overcrowded hospitals, and making it impossible to say goodbye to relatives dying in the hospital dominated the media. While the new reality may be confusing and overwhelming to many people, it is a good time to reflect on human and patient rights. Patients' rights are defined in the Constitution of the Republic of Poland and in the Act of 6 November 2008 on Patients' Rights and Patients' Rights Ombudsman (Ustawa o praw pacjentów i Rzecznik Praw Pacjenta, UoPP). Among the rights listed in the AoPP, we can distinguish: The right to health services, the right to information, the right to medical documentation, the right to consent to health services, the right to information secrecy, the right to report adverse effects of medicinal products, the right to object to a doctor's opinion or ruling, the right to respect for intimacy and dignity, the right to respect private and family life. In the event of violation of rights, the patient may seek compensation before a civil court. Medical facilities, supported limiting patient's rights during pandemic with article 5 of UoPP, which points, that ""the head of the healthcare provider or the medical doctor delegated by him may limit the exercise of patient rights in the event of an epidemic risk or for reasons of patient safety"". It seems, that epidemic limited the right to health services the most. At the beginning of the pandemic outbreak, there were closures of health facilities, making registration and access to doctors impossible. The problem was partly solved by providing services to patients in the form of phone call consultation. The ongoing epidemic has highlighted the condition of the Polish health care system and has contributed to the exposure of problems that previously seemed to have been overlooked. The legislator should pay special attention to this clear message and try to work out the best solutions for the future. © 2021 Polish Pharmaceutical Society.

The results showed that nearly 80% of the respondents engaged in e-shopping more frequently than they did before the outbreak of COVID-19. As regards shopping online more frequently in general (i.e., for at least one product type), females were more likely to do so. In-store shopping enjoyment and a decrease in income were a facilitator and a deterrent, respectively. Regarding specific product types, completely working from home had a positive association with more frequent e-purchasing for electronics. Fear of disease encouraged higher frequencies of e-shopping for food and medical products. Notably, the shortage of physical supply was not a determinant of buying any product type online more frequently. As for the implications of our findings, supporting and encouraging low-income shoppers, older persons, and females to engage in e-shopping is necessary to limit the detrimental effects of the pandemic on their lives. The growth of internet purchasing expresses a need to manage the development of urban delivery services, to limit the uncontrolled proliferation of motorcycles. E-shopping requires delivery to complete the online-to-offline process;therefore, protecting the health of delivery drivers to ensure the safety of the whole online shopping process would be necessary.","Nguyen, Minh Hieu Armoogum Jimmy Nguyen Thi Binh",Sustainability,423,25

Thus, if we can accurately forecast the trend of cases globally, the spread of the pandemic can be controlled. In this study, a hybrid CNN-LSTM model was developed on a time-series dataset to forecast the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19. The proposed model was evaluated and compared with 17 baseline models on test and forecast data. The primary finding of this research is that the proposed CNN-LSTM model outperformed them all, with the lowest average MAPE, RMSE, and RRMSE values on both test and forecast data. Conclusively, our experimental results show that, while standalone CNN and LSTM models provide acceptable and efficient forecasting performance for the confirmed COVID-19 cases time series, combining both models in the proposed CNN-LSTM encoder-decoder structure provides a significant boost in forecasting performance. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the suggested model produced satisfactory predicting results even with a small amount of data.","Zain, Zuhaira M.; Alturki, Nazik M.",Journal of Control Science and Engineering,423,25

The prevention of recurrent events is important to patients, clinicians and payers. In this post-hoc analysis, we evaluated the effect of canagliflozin on total HHF events. Methods: The CREDENCE trial compared canagliflozin or matching placebo and followed patients for a median of 2.6 years. The study included 4401 participants with type 2 diabetes, substantial albuminuria and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 30 to <90 ml/min/1.73 m2 receiving renin-angiotensin system blockade. Negative binomial regression models were performed to assess the effect of canagliflozin on the total number of HHF events. Results: The mean age of participants was 63 years, with a mean eGFR of 56.3 ml/min/1.73 m2, while 50% had a history of previous cardiovascular disease and 15% had a history of heart failure. During the trial, 230 people experienced 326 total HHF events, with 166 having 1 event, 43 having 2 events, 15 having 3 events, and 6 having ≥4 events;thus, 42% of those experiencing at least 1 event went on to suffer a recurrent event during the follow up. Canagliflozin reduced first HHF events by 39% (hazard ratio [HR], 0.61;95% confidence interval [CI] 0.47-0.80;P <0.001;number needed to treat [NNT], 46;95% CI 29-124) and total HHF events by 36% (event rates of 22.0 and 34.8 participants with an event/1000 patient-years with canagliflozin and placebo, respectively;incidence rate ratio [RR], 0.64;95% CI 0.56-0.73;P <0.001). Conclusions: Canagliflozin significantly reduced first and recurrent HHF events. These findings provide further support for the benefit of continuing canagliflozin therapy after an index heart failure presentation to prevent recurrent HHF events. Disclosure: J.

Here, we synthesised a photoactivatable N-4HCS derivative, probe 2, to identify the N-4HCS cellular target. Using probe 2 in photo-affinity labelling coupled with mass spectrometry, we identified the 16 kDa Plasmodium falciparum parasitophorous vacuole membrane protein Pfs16 as the likely cellular target of the N-4HCS series. Further validating Pfs16 as the cellular target of the N-4HCS series, the Cellular Thermal Shift Assay (CETSA) confirmed DDD01035881 stabilised Pfs16 in lysate from activated mature gametocytes. Additionally, photo-affinity labelling combined with in-gel fluorescence and immunoblot analysis confirmed the N-4HCS series interacted with Pfs16. High-resolution, widefield fluorescence and electron microscopy of N-4HCS-inhibited parasites was found to result in a cell morphology entirely consistent with targeted gene disruption of Pfs16. Taken together, these data strongly implicate Pfs16 as the target of DDD01035881 and establish the N-4HCS scaffold family as a powerful starting point from which future transmission-blocking antimalarials can be developed.","Yahiya, Sabrina; Saunders, Charlie N.; Straschil, Ursula; Fischer, Oliver J.; Rueda-Zubiaurre, Ainoa; Haase, Silvia; Vizcay-Barrena, Gema; Jordan, Sarah; Hassan, Sarah; Delves, Michael J.; Tate, Edward W.; Barnard, Anna; Fuchter, Matthew J.; Baum, Jake",bioRxiv,423,16

We present two models. The first one is a model of predictive control with receding horizon and discontinuous actions of unknown costs for the implementation of adaptive triggering policies during the disease. This model is based on a periodic assessment of the peak of the pandemic (and, thus, of the health care demand) utilizing the latest data about the transmission and recovery rate of the disease. Consequently, the model seems to be suitable for discontinuous, non-mechanical (i.e. human) actions with unknown effectiveness, like those applied in the case of COVID-19. Secondly, we consider a feedback control problem in order to contain the pandemic at the capacity of the NHS (National Health System). As input parameter we consider the value p that reflects the intensity-effectiveness of the measures applied and as output the predicted maximum of infected people to be treated by NHS. The feedback control regulates p so that the number of infected people is manageable. Based on this approach, we address the following questions: (a) the limits of improvement of this approach;(b) the effectiveness of this approach;(c) the time horizon and timing of the application. © American Institute of Mathematical Sciences","Leventides, J.; Poulios, C.; Tsiatsios, G.

This finding has been associated with viral-induced olfactory neuron dysfunction rather than the nasal congestion typically found in cold- or flu-like states. In literature, the prevalence of anosmia varies from 15% to 85%, and the studies, in general, were based on the subjective evaluation of patients self-reports of loss of smell (yes or no question). In the present study, we quantitatively evaluated olfactory dysfunction and the prevalence of fever in symptomatic patients suspected of having COVID-19 using a scratch-and-sniff olfactory test and infrared temperature testing with RT-PCR as the gold-standard comparator method to diagnose COVID-19 infection. MethodsOutpatients had their forehead temperature checked with an infrared non-contact thermometer (temperature guns). After that, they received two olfactory smell identification test (SIT) cards (u-Smell-it; CT, USA) that each had 5 scent windows and were asked to scratch with a pencil and sniff each of the 10 small circles containing the microencapsulated fragrances and mark the best option on a response card. Nasopharyngeal swabs were then collected for Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) to determine if the patients were positive or negative for COVID-19 infection. We considered the number of hits (correct answers) [â¤] 5 as positive for loss of smell (LOS) in the olfactory test; [â¥] 6 hits was considered negative for LOS (i.e. normal olfactory function). All data were analyzed using Excel and Matlab software. ResultsIn the present study, 165 patients were eligible for the olfactory test and nasopharyngeal swab collection RT-PCR. Five patients were excluded because of inconclusive PCR results (n=2) and missing data (n=3). A total of 160 patients completed all the protocols. The RT-PCR positivity rate for COVID-19 was 27.5% (n=44), and PCR+ patients scored significantly worse in the olfactory test (5.5{+/-}3.5) compared to RT-PCR-patients (8.2{+/-}1.8, p<0.001). 0/44 PCR+ patients presented with a fever ([â¥]37.8{degrees}C). In contrast an olfactory SIT had a specificity of 94.8% (95% CI, 89.1 - 98.1), sensitivity of 47.7% (95% CI, 32.7 - 63.3), accuracy of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.75 - 0.87), positive predictive value of 77.8% (95% CI, 59.6 - 88.8), negative predictive value of 82.7% (85% CI, 78.7 - 86.7), and odds ratio of 16.7.

According to the research findings, MB has potential as a direct antiviral drug for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 in the first stages of the disease. However, the MB accumulation by various types of tissues, as well as by immune cells, has not been previously studied. Therefore, the objective of this study was to obtain spectral data on the interstitial distribution of the administered drug in endothelial tissues in primates. The data on interstitial MB distribution obtained by spectroscopic measurement at both macro-and microlevels during oral administration to Hamadryas baboon individuals demonstrate that MB accumulates in mucous membranes of gastrointestinal tract and the tissues of the respiratory, cardiovascular, immune, and nervous systems. Additionally, it was found that MB was present in lung and brain myeloid cells in significant concentrations, which makes it potentially useful for protection from autoimmune response (cytokine storm) and as a tool for the correction of immunocompetent cells’ functional state during laser irradiation. Since the cytokine storm starts from monocytic cells during SARS-CoV-2 cellular damage and since tumor-associated macrophages can significantly alter tumor metabolism, accumulation of MB in these cells provides a reason to conclude that the immune response correction in COVID-19 patients and change in macrophages phenotype can be achieved by deactivation of inflammatory macrophages in tissues with MB using laser radiation of red spectral range. © 2021 by the authors.

These were bringing it closer to grid parity. However, massive rooftop PVs without storage at medium and low voltages will cause power quality problems, namely increased voltage fluctuation, unbalanced voltage, and harmonics, in addition to active load fluctuations and power factor on nearby buses. The use of an inverter to convert DC to AC will increase the number of non-linear loads on the network so that it will increase the presence of harmonics. In early 2020 the Coronavirus pandemic was spread over the world and brought people to have activities from home. This condition shifts the portion of power consumption for each sector and increases the probability of rooftop PVs usage. This paper analysed the comparison of the use of two inverters with different harmonic characteristics with various levels of rooftop PV penetration in the distribution network. From the simulation results, it can be concluded that the existing harmonic characteristics of the inverter used has a more significant impact than the PV rooftop penetration level on the increase of harmonics in the distribution network.","Jintaka, D.

Public Health England initiated prospective, longitudinal SARS-CoV-2 sero-surveillance in schools across England after the first national lockdown, which allowed comparison of child and adult responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection over time. Methods Staff and students had venepuncture for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in school during June, July and December 2020. Blood samples were tested for nucleocapsid (Abbott) and receptor binding domain (RBD) antibodies (in-house assay), and student samples were additionally assessed for live virus neutralising activity. Results In June 2020, 1,344 staff and 835 students were tested. Overall, 11.5% (95% CI: 9.4-13.9) and 11.3% (95% CI: 9.2-13.6; p=0.88) of students had nucleoprotein and RBD antibodies, compared to 15.6% (95% CI: 13.7-17.6) and 15.3% (95% CI: 13.4-17.3; p=0.83) of staff. Live virus neutralising activity was detected in 79.8% (n=71/89) of nucleocapsid and 85.5% (71/83) of RBD antibody positive children. RBD antibodies correlated more strongly with neutralising antibodies (rs=0.7527; p<0.0001) than nucleocapsid antibodies (rs=0.3698; p<0.0001). A median of 24.4 weeks later, 58.2% (107/184) participants had nucleocapsid antibody seroreversion, compared to 20.9% (33/158) for RBD (p<0.001). Similar seroreversion rates were observed between staff and students for nucleocapsid (p=0.26) and RBD-antibodies (p=0.43). Nucleocapsid and RBD antibody quantitative results were significantly lower in staff compared to students (p=0.028 and <0.0001 respectively) at baseline, but not at 24 weeks (p=0.16 and p=0.37, respectively). Conclusion RBD antibodies correlated more strongly with live virus neutralising activity.

We examined the influence of age, race, sex, database, time-at-risk start event and duration, season and year, prior observation and clean window. For binary comparisons we calculated incidence rate ratios and performed random-effect model meta-analysis. Results We observed a wide variation of background rates. The population characteristics had the largest impact with rates varying up to a factor of 1,000 across age groups. Even after adjusting for age and sex, the study showed residual bias due to the other parameters. Anchoring on any type of healthcare encounter yielded higher incidence when compared to anchoring on a random date, especially for short time-at-risk. The rates were highly variable across databases. Conclusion Background rates were highly sensitive to demographic characteristics of population, so comparing background to observed rates requires age, sex and race adjustment, and even with these adjustments, variability remains high among databases.

Thus, this study aimed to assess the status of HTP use among pregnant women in Japan and explore the risk of HDP and LBW associated with HTP use. Methods: Using data from the Japan ""COVID-19 and Society"" Internet Survey (JACSIS) study, a web-based nationwide survey, we investigated 558 post-delivery and 365 currently pregnant women in October 2020. We assessed the prevalence of ever HTP smokers (defined as ever experiencing HTP use) in post-delivery and currently pregnant women. Among post-delivery women, we collected the information regarding HDP and LBW based on their Maternal and Child Health Handbooks (maternal and newborn records). In the multivariable regression analysis, we estimated the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of ever HTP smokers for HDP and LBW compared with those of never HTP smokers using logistic regression. A stratified analysis with respect to combustible cigarette smoking (never/ever) was also performed. Results: The prevalence of ever HTP use were 11.7% and 12.6% in post-delivery and currently pregnant women, respectively. Among post-delivery women, ever HTP smokers had higher HDP incidence (13.8% vs. 6.5%, P=0.03), with an OR of 2.78 (95% CI 0.84--9.15) and higher LBW incidence (18.5% versus 8.9%, P=0.02), with an elevated OR of 2.08 (95% CI 0.80--5.39). A similar tendency was observed among never and ever combustible cigarette smokers. Conclusion: In Japan, the incidence of HTP use has exceeded 10% among pregnant women, and HTP smoking may be associated with increased maternal and neonatal risks.

Less is known about whether and under what circumstances elderly will switch to OGS. Building on the theory of planned behavior (TPB), this study examined how decision making, online shopping habits for edible and non-edible items, and active and motorized mobility limitations are associated with elderly’s OGS behaviour. An online survey of 560 older individuals from two metropolitan regions in Quebec, Canada was conducted. We collected data on online shopping habits, difficulties walking, intentions to cease driving, and current frequency of grocery trips, together with related TPB constructs (intentions, self-reported OGS behavior, behavioral, normative and control beliefs, attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioral control). After verifying the basic TPB model, difficulties walking, driving cessation, frequency of grocery trips and online shopping habits for edible and non-edible items were integrated in structural equation models. Results support physical and motorized mobility loss and acquired OGS habits as decisive conditions for future OGS, along with attitudes and subjective norms as strong drivers of OGS intention formation. Shopping online for non-edible items did not predict OGS behavior. Getting past a first trial seemed much more important than technological difficulties in transitioning to OGS in our sample. OGS can successfully replace grocery trips as mobility declines. The recent COVID-19 related surges in forced OGS might trigger wider longer-term adoption in this population segment. Driving cessation programs should consider integrating OGS training to replace grocery trips prior to mobility loss.","Bezirgani, Ana Lachapelle Ugo",Travel Behaviour and Society,423,7

Functional studies and molecular dynamics simulations of coding variants of GLP1R, a well-established type 2 diabetes treatment target, provided a genetic framework for optimal selection of GLP-1R agonist therapy. We also provided new evidence from Mendelian randomisation that lung function is modulated by blood glucose and that pulmonary dysfunction is a diabetes complication. Thus, our approach based on RG GWAS provided wide-ranging insights into the biology of glucose regulation, diabetes complications and the potential for treatment stratification.","Lagou, V.; Jiang, L.; Ulrich, A.; Zudina, L.; Gutierrez Gonzalez, K.

The current pandemic has aggravated preexisting prejudices and shed light on long-standing social, economic, and health inequities that have been and continue to be perpetuated by systems of oppression. Psychologists are in a unique position to collaboratively work with marginalized individuals navigating pandemic threat, discrimination, and oppressive systems. This paper presents best practice recommendations for U.S.-based psychologists working with marginalized populations impacted by COVID-19. Psychologists are encouraged to synchronously develop the following three areas of evidence-based practice, as they relate to the impacts of COVID-19: (a) self-reflection and self-awareness in a COVID-19 context (i.e., reflecting on one's identities and one's knowledge and attitudes toward sociohistorical inequities), (b) knowledge acquisition (i.e., adopting an attitude of cultural humility, identifying ""emotional contagion,"" identifying impacts of systemic injustice that may be compounded by COVID-19, and recognizing racial trauma in clients of color), and (c) collaboration with clients (i.e., identify the mental health toll of oppressive systems, explore COVID-19 relevant and culturally responsive methods of healing, encourage virtual community engagement, and incorporate ethnic and racial identity development in personal and professional work). Engaging with these best practice recommendations should result in the psychologist's improved ability to identify and address the consequences of systemic oppression that have been highlighted and exacerbated by COVID-19 on their own behavior and their clients' mental health. Furthermore, psychologists engaged with these best practice recommendations should find themselves better prepared to utilize culturally responsive interventions despite barriers created by COVID-19.

Given their high sensitivity, low-frequency large radio facilities may already be able to detect signatures of this extended radio emission from the region in between two close and massive galaxy clusters. In this work we exploit the non-detection of such diffuse emission by deep observations of two pairs of relatively close ($\simeq 10$ Mpc) and massive ($M_{500}\geq 10^{14}M_\odot$) galaxy clusters using the LOw-Frequency ARray (LOFAR). By combining the results from the two putative inter-cluster filaments, we derive new independent constraints on the median strength of inter-galactic magnetic fields: $B_{\rm 10 Mpc}<2.5\times 10^2\,\rm nG\,(95\%\, \rm CL)$. Based on cosmological simulations and assuming a primordial origin of the B-fields, these estimates can be used to limit the amplitude of primordial seed magnetic fields: $B_0\leq10\,\rm nG$. We advise the observation of similar cluster pairs as a powerful tool to set tight constraints on the amplitude of extragalactic magnetic fields.","Locatelli, Nicola; Vazza, Franco; Bonafede, Annalisa; Banfi, Serena; Bernardi, Gianni; Gheller, Claudio; Botteon, Andrea; Shimwell, Timothy",,423,13

Helpful involvement from care partners (CPs) has positive impacts on diabetes self-management. Less is known regarding the relationship between the number of CPs and the level of helpful and harmful involvement. We examined the relationship between the number of in and out-of-home CPs and helpful and harmful involvement in patients' diabetes self-management. Methods: Adults with type 2 diabetes (N=369) were recruited from a web-based panel. Participants completed the Family and Friend Involvement in Adults' Diabetes (FIAD) scale and reported the number of in and out-of-home CPs who provide help with their diabetes self-management. A two-step hierarchical linear regression was used to examine the linear and quadratic trends between number of in and out-of-home CPs and helpful and harmful involvement in diabetes self-care, controlling for age, sex, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Results: There was a positive linear relationship between the number of in and out-of-home CPs, and helpful and harmful involvement (p's;range < .001 to .003). The addition of quadratic terms accounted for a significant increase in explained variance in helpful and harmful involvement (p's < .001). There was a positive trend between the number of in and out-of-home CPs and helpful and harmful involvement among adults with up to approximately 5 CPs. In contrast, there was a negative trend between these variables among individuals with 5 or more CPs. Conclusions: Patients with a relatively small or large number of CPs, receive less helpful and harmful support. Large CP networks are not necessarily indicative of high levels of helpful involvement in patients' diabetes self-care. CP interventions should attempt to enhance helpful involvement while minimizing harmful involvement in these populations.","Kim, Min Jung Park Chang G.; Fritschi, Cynthia",Diabetes,423,20

The general hypothesis of signature based drug repurposing is that drugs with inverse similarity to a disease signature can reverse disease phenotype and thus be effective against it. However, in the case of viral infection diseases, like SARS-CoV-2, infected cells also activate adaptive, antiviral pathways, so that the relationship between effective drug and disease signature can be more ambiguous. To address this question, we analysed gene expression data from in vitro SARS-CoV-2 infected cell lines, and gene expression signatures of drugs showing anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Our extensive functional genomic analysis showed that both infection and treatment with in vitro effective drugs leads to activation of antiviral pathways like NFkB and JAK-STAT. Based on the similarity - and not inverse similarity - between drug and infection-induced gene expression signatures, we were able to predict the in vitro antiviral activity of drugs. We also identified SREBF1/2, key regulators of lipid metabolising enzymes, as the most activated transcription factors by several in vitro effective antiviral drugs. Using a fluorescently labeled cholesterol sensor, we showed that these drugs decrease the cholesterol levels of plasma-membrane. Supplementing drug-treated cells with cholesterol reversed the in vitro antiviral effect, suggesting the depleting plasma-membrane cholesterol plays a key role in virus inhibitory mechanism. Our results can help to more effectively repurpose approved drugs against SARS-CoV-2, and also highlights key mechanisms behind their antiviral effect.","Barsi, Szilvia; Papp, Henrietta; Urbelz, Alberto Valdeolivas; Tóth, Dániel J.; Kuczmog, Anett; Madai, Mónika; Hunyady, László; Várnai, Péter; Saez-Rodriguez, Julio; Jakab, Ferenc; Szalai, Bence",bioRxiv,423,13

The spike protein of Kappa contains four mutations E154K, L452R, E484Q and P681R, and Delta contains L452R, T478K and P681R, while B.1.618 spike harbors mutations Δ145-146 and E484K. However, it remains unknown whether these variants have altered in their entry efficiency, host tropism, and sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies as well as entry inhibitors. In this study, we found that Kappa, Delta or B.1.618 spike uses human ACE2 with no or slightly increased efficiency, while gains a significantly increased binding affinity with mouse, marmoset and koala ACE2 orthologs, which exhibits limited binding with WT spike. Furthermore, the P618R mutation leads to enhanced spike cleavage, which could facilitate viral entry. In addition, Kappa, Delta and B.1.618 exhibits a reduced sensitivity to neutralization by convalescent sera owning to the mutation of E484Q, T478K, Δ145-146 or E484K, but remains sensitive to entry inhibitors-ACE2-lg decoy receptor. Collectively, our study revealed that enhanced human and mouse ACE2 receptor engagement, increased spike cleavage and reduced sensitivity to neutralization antibodies of Kappa, Delta and B.1.618 may contribute to the rapid spread of these variants and expanded host range. Furthermore, our result also highlighted that ACE2-lg could be developed as broad-spectrum antiviral strategy against SARS-CoV-2 variants.","Ren, Wenlin; Ju, Xiaohui; Gong, Mingli; Lan, Jun; Yu, Yanying; Long, Quanxin; Zhang, Yu; Zhong, Jin; Zhong, Guocai; Wang, Xinquan; Huang, Ailong; Zhang, Rong; Ding, Qiang",bioRxiv,423,1

The lockdown disrupted the employment and practices of many journalists in ways that may reveal the contemporary tensions between professional identity and working conditions more clearly than in average news cycles. In order to understand what the Belgian French-speaking journalists went through during the first lockdown, we conducted a survey about the implications of the crisis for their employment status and work practices. This survey also covered their perceptions concerning their social role, their journalistic skills and the quality of their work covering the COVID-19 crisis. The responses show a sharp contrast between challenging working conditions (isolation, lack of expertise and job losses in worst cases) and the satisfaction that comes from the social contribution of their reporting.

The rising global burden from multimorbidity is well-documented, but trial evidence for effective interventions in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is limited. Selection of appropriate outcomes is fundamental to trial design to ensure cross-study comparability, but there is currently no agreement on a core outcome set (COS) to include in trials investigating multimorbidity specifically in LMIC. Our aim is to develop international consensus on two COS for trials of interventions to prevent and treat multimorbidity in LMIC settings. Methods and Analysis Following methods recommended by the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET initiative), the development of these two COS will occur in three stages: (1) generation of a long list of potential outcomes for inclusion; (2) two-round online Delphi surveys; and (3) consensus meetings. First, to generate an initial list of outcomes, we will conduct a systematic review of multimorbidity intervention and prevention trials and interviews with people living with multimorbidity and their caregivers in LMICs. Outcomes will be classified using an outcome taxonomy. Two-round Delphi surveys will be used to elicit importance scores for these outcomes from people living with multimorbidity, caregivers, healthcare professionals, policy makers, and researchers in LMICs. Finally, consensus meetings will be held to discuss the Delphi survey results and agree outcomes for inclusion in the two COS.

To evaluate the potential antiviral activity of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD proteins, we determined the RBD residues of SARS-CoV-2 using a homology search with RBD of SARS-CoV. For efficient expression and purification, the signal peptide of spike protein was identified and used to generate constructs expressing recombinant RBD proteins. Highly purified RBD protein fused with the Fc domain of human IgG showed potent anti-viral efficacy, which was better than that of a protein fused with a histidine tag.

Women were invited to participate via e-mail or invitations posted on the Facebook page for MyEndometriosisTeam (a social network support group for women living with the disease) between December 9, 2020, to January 31, 2021. Setting United States (US). Patients or Participants 155 women with a self-reported history of endometriosis, 21yrs or older, living in the US completed the survey. Interventions None. This was an observational study. Measurements and Main Results Most women (76%) were 30-49 years old, 51% had daily pain symptoms, 25% experiencing pain a few times a week. Of a separate group of women who reported that that their endometriosis-associated pain worsened since the beginning of the pandemic (52%), the most common triggers for worsening pain were stress (80%), fatigue (74%), depression/anxiety (71%), financial concerns (45%), inability to undergo surgery (40%) and inability to exercise (38%). More than a third of women conveyed (38%) challenges with obtaining prescription medications and scheduling surgeries. Of the 17% for whom surgery was postponed, 50% of the women reported this as indefinite. Women's concerns about their endometriosis in relation to COVID-19 included whether it makes COVID-19 symptoms worst (53%), whether they are at a greater risk of acquiring COVID-19 (44%), and whether it is safe to visit a doctor/hospital (28%). Only 32% spoke with their doctor about treating their pain and 35% had no interaction with their doctor during the pandemic.

However, sensitive and specific detection of ST and SPA in environmental samples has been challenging. In this study, we developed and validated two methods for concentrating and detecting ST/SPA from wastewater: the Moore swab trap method for qualitative results, and ultrafiltration (UF) for sensitive quantitative detection, coupled with qPCR. We then applied these methods for ST and SPA wastewater surveillance in Kolkata, India and Dhaka, Bangladesh, two enteric fever endemic areas. The qPCR assays had a limit of detection of 17 equivalent genome copies (EGC) for ST and 25 EGC for SPA with good reproducibility. In seeded trials, the Moore swab method had a limit of detection of approximately 0.05-0.005 cfu/mL for both ST and SPA. In 53 Moore swab samples collected from three Kolkata pumping stations between September 2019 to March 2020, ST was detected in 69.8% and SPA was detected in 20.8%. Analysis of sewage samples seeded with known amount of ST and SPA and concentrated via the UF method, followed by polyethylene glycol precipitation and qPCR detection demonstrated that UF can effectively recover approximately 8 log10 cfu, 5 log10 cfu, and 3 log10 cfu of seeded ST and SPA in 5 L, 10 L, and 20 L of wastewater. Using the UF method in Dhaka, ST was detected in 26.7% (8/30) of 20 L drain samples with a range of 0.11- 2.10 log10 EGC per 100 mL and 100% (4/4) of 20 L canal samples with a range of 1.02 - 2.02 log10 EGC per 100 mL. These results indicate that the Moore swab and UF methods provide sensitive presence/absence and quantitative detection of ST/SPA in wastewater samples, and these two methods can be used jointly or separately for Salmonella Typhi environmental surveillance.","Liu, P.; Ibaraki, M.; Kapoor, R.; Amin, N.; Das, A.; Miah, M.

Drawing from the concept of ontological security, it will be discussed how different services' levels of ""housing adequacy"" shaped remarkably different experiences of the pandemic for homeless people and social workers in terms of health protection and agency. Design/methodology/approach This paper focuses on a case study concerning homeless services for people during the COVID-19 pandemic in the metropolitan and suburban area of Turin, in Northern Italy. In-depth interviews with social workers and participant observation during online meetings of workers from the shelters constitute the empirical data that have been collected during the first wave of the pandemic in Italy. Findings According to the findings, the pandemic showed shelters as unsafe places that reduce homeless people's decision power and separate them from the rest of the citizenship. Instead, Housing First projects emerged as imore inclusive and safermore inclusive and safer spaces, able to enhance people's power over their own lives. The pandemic did not create emerging issues in the homeless services system or discontinuities: rather, it amplified pre-existing problematic aspects. Originality/value The case study presented provides empirical insights to recognise at the political and organisational level the importance of housing as a measure of individual and collective security, calling for an intervention to tackle homelessness in terms of housing policies rather than exclusively social and emergency treatment.","Leonardi, D.; Stefani, S.",Housing Care and Support,423,1

Bacteriophage T7 recruits the small protein thioredoxin of the E. coli host as an essential processivity factor for the viral DNA polymerase. We challenged the phage to propagate in a host in which thioredoxin had been extensively modified to hamper its recruitment. The virus adapted to the engineered host without losing the capability to propagate in the original host, but no genetic mutations were fixed in the thioredoxin binding domain of the viral DNA polymerase. Virus adaptation correlated with mutations in the viral RNA polymerase, supporting that promiscuous thioredoxin recruitment was enabled by phenotypic mutations caused by transcription errors. These results point to a hitherto unknown mechanism of virus adaptation that may play a role in crossspecies transmission. We propose that phenotypic mutations may generally contribute to the capability of viruses to evade antiviral strategies.","Luzon-Hidalgo, Raquel; Risso, Valeria A.; Delgado, Asuncion; Andrés-Leon, Eduardo; Ibarra-Molero, Beatriz; Sanchez-Ruiz, Jose M.",bioRxiv,423,1

Irish philosopher-poet John Moriarty described it as ‘a teeming word … a haunted word … a word to conjure with’. The most celebrated and culturally enduring nostos is that of Homer’s Odysseus who spent ten years returning home after the fall of Troy. His journey back involved many obstacles, temptations, and fantastical adventures and even a katabasis, a rare descent by the living into the realm of the dead. All the while he was sustained and propelled by his memories of Ithaca (‘His native home deep imag’d in his soul’, as Pope’s translation has it). From Virgil’s Aeneid to James Joyce’s Ulysses, from MGM’s The Wizard of Oz to the Coen Brothers’ O Brother, Where Art Thou?, and from Derek Walcott’s Omeros to Margaret Atwood’s Penelopiad, the Odyssean paradigm of nostos and nostalgia has been continually summoned and reimagined by writers and filmmakers. At the same time, ‘Ithaca’ has proved to be an evocative and versatile abstraction. It is as much about possibility as it is about the past;it is a vision of Arcadia or a haunting, an object of longing, a repository of memory, ‘a sleep and a forgetting’. In essence it is about seeking what is absent. Imagining Ithaca explores the idea of nostos, and its attendant pain (algos), in an excitingly eclectic range of sources: from Rebecca West’s The Return of the Soldier and Remarque’s All Quiet on the Western Front, through the exilic memoirs of Nabokov and the time-travelling fantasies of Woody Allen, to Seamus Heaney’s Virgilian descent into the London Underground and Michael Portillo’s Telemachan railway journey to Salamanca. This kaleidoscopic exploration spans the end of the Great War, when the world at large was experiencing the complexities of homecoming, to the era of Brexit and COVID-19 which has put the notion of nostalgia firmly under the microscope. © Kathleen Riley 2021.","Riley, K.",Imagining Ithaca: Nostos and Nostalgia Since the Great War,423,16

Real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) is accounted for the perfect point of reference in detecting this virus. The notion that this virus also invades the male reproductive tract requires further investigation to prove the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the semen. This investigation was designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 survivors semen. This study design was a cross-sectional examination and conducted between November 2020 and March 2021 in the Andrology Unit of Dr. Soetomo General Hospital and Professor Nidom Foundation, both located in the City of Surabaya, Indonesia. The sample was 34 male participants aged above 18 years old and had been confirmed COVID-19 by nasopharyngeal swab PCR test. Part of the semen was taken for real-time PCR testing with the QuantStudio 5 Applied Biosystem (AB) PCR machine and the kits utilized were the STANDARD M nCOV Real-Time Detection Kit and mBioCov-19 RT-PCR Kit. Furthermore, the mean of participants ages was 35.74 years old with 25% of them had had a history of primary infertility and 21.8% of secondary infertility. From the real-time PCR COVID-19 of the semen examination, this investigation found that 27 participants had been negatives (74.4%), six inconclusive (17.6%), and one positive (3%) of SARS CoV-2.

Increased hospital visits to receive treatment as well as interaction with healthcare personnel (HCP), represent a potential risk factor for acquiring COVID-19. Our objective was to analyze the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate in patients (pts) with cancer and HCP of a chemoradiotherapy unit localized in a center designated as a COVID-19 priority facility in Mexico City. Methods: We invited HCP and pts with solid tumors attending the chemoradiotherapy unit to participate in a prospective follow-up cohort to early detect asymptomatic COVID-19 infection. Only participants who gave informed consent were included. A RT-PCR test for SARS-COV-2 from nasopharyngeal swab samples was performed every 2 weeks, and daily electronic clinical questionnaires were sent. Recruitment started on June 12, 2020. Participants entered the study in different moments and they were followed until a positive test for COVID-19 was found, or pts finished treatment or, HCP changed work area or, withdrawal of inform consent, or follow up completion, which ever occurred first. The last day of follow up was September 30, 2020. The general infection rate during all the period of follow-up was calculated, as well as the infection rate per month. Results: We included 130 asymptomatic participants, 44.6% (n = 58) were HCP and 55.4% (n = 72) were cancer pts, 45.9% (n = 61) were men, and 54.1% (n = 72) were women. During a median follow-up of 85 days (IQR 48-103) we performed 634 nasopharyngeal swabs for SARSCoV- 2 RT-PCR, with a median number per participant of 5 (IQR 3-7). Within this period, 18 (13.5%) participants tested positive for SARS-CoV- 2 infection. 12 were asymptomatic and 6 developed symptoms. None of them had a severe form of COVID-19 and we did not register any death associated to COVID-19. Table shows the infection rate per month. Conclusions: In our center, during the time period of follow up, the overall rate of COVID-19 infection was higher than that reported in a study from asymptomatic HCP and office workers in Mexico City (13.5 vs 8.4%). We also observed a monthly variation that was consistent with the months with the highest number of cases detected in Mexico City during the first wave. With careful implementation, it is feasible to continue to safely deliver systemic oncologic treatments during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Medina, M. I. M.; Hernandez-Felix, J. H.; Camargo, V. R.

Methods: Data from the Mortality Information System were used. Expected deaths for 2020 were estimated from 2015 to 2019 data using a negative binomial log-linear model. Results: Excess deaths in Brazil in 2020 amounted to 13.7%, and the ratio of excess deaths to COVID-19 deaths was 0.90. Reductions in deaths from cardiovascular diseases (CVD), respiratory diseases, and external causes, and an increase in ill-defined causes were all noted. Excess deaths were also found to be heterogeneous, being higher in the Northern, Center-Western, and Northeastern states. In some states, the number of COVID-19 deaths was lower than that of excess deaths, whereas the opposite occurred in others. Moreover, excess deaths were higher in men, in those aged 20 to 59, and in black, yellow, or indigenous individuals. Meanwhile, excess mortality was lower in women, individuals aged 80 years or older, and in whites. Additionally, deaths among those aged 0 to 19 were 7.2% lower than expected, with reduction in mortality from respiratory diseases and external causes. There was also a drop in mortality due to external causes in men and in those aged 20 to 39 years. Furthermore, reductions in deaths from CVD and neoplasms were noted in some states and groups. Conclusion: There is evidence of underreporting of COVID-19 deaths and of the possible impact of restrictive measures in the reduction of deaths from external causes and respiratory diseases. The impacts of COVID-19 on mortality were heterogeneous among the states and groups, revealing that regional, demographic, socioeconomic, and racial differences expose individuals in distinct ways to the risk of death from both COVID-19 and other causes.

This is the reason, ""flexibility"" is becoming an inherent part of an employer's support to its employees. Due to the unprecedented outbreak of novel corona virus (COVID-19), most companies have adopted flexibility of working from anywhere, for their employees. This digital transformation took place almost instantaneously. Hence, neither the employees, nor the employers were fully prepared for this situation. This definitely makes our lives convenient. But there exists another side of the coin which is concerned with the security issues pertaining to use of personal networks and devices. The home network devices have not been configured to be secure in line with the employer's requirements. That is the reason, attackers have a larger surface to get their hands dirty on.

Adjuncts minimising exposure of healthcare workers to hazardous pathogens released during AGP may be beneficial. We used state-of-the-art Computational Fluid Dynamics modelling to optimise the performance of a custom-designed shield. Methods We modelled airflow patterns and trajectories of particles (size range 1-500{micro}m) emitted during a typical cough using Computational Fluid Dynamics (ANSYS Fluent software), in the presence and absence of a protective shield enclosing the head of a patient. We modelled the effect of different shield designs, suction tube position, and suction flow rate on particle escape from the shield. Results Use of the shield prevented escape of 99.1-100% of particles, which were either trapped on the shield walls (16-21%) or extracted via suction (79-82%). At most, 0.9% particles remained floating inside the shield. Suction flow rates (40-160L min-1) had no effect on the final location of particles in a closed system. Particle removal from within the shield was optimal when a suction catheter was placed vertically next to the head of the patient. Addition of multiple openings in the shield reduced the purging performance from 99% at 160 L min-1 to 67% at 40 L min-1. Conclusion Computational fluid dynamics modelling provides information to guide optimisation of the efficient removal of hazardous pathogens released during AGP from a custom-designed shield.

Infection rates for the first 30 days post CAR T range from 23% (Hill et al, Blood 2018) to 42% (Park et al, Clin Infect Dis 2018) with a predominance of early bacterial infections. Infection etiology is multifactorial, including pre-existing immunosuppression, poor marrow reserve, concomitant disease, delayed cytopenias and lymphodepletion. CRS has been shown to be an independent risk factor and associated treatment (Tocilizumab, steroids) may contribute. Risk assessment is limited by heterogenous cohorts in published reports and practice variations in use of prophylactic antibiotics and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). To determine incidence and outcome of infection with licensed CAR T-cell products, we conducted a retrospective review at UCLH, London, UK. Methods: Electronic medical records were used to collect data on patients treated with Tisagen/Axicel from May 2019 to July 2020. Infections at ≤28 days and >28days following infusion were recorded. Infections were defined as a positive microbiological/virology result in conjunction with clinical symptoms. Invasive fungal infections were classified according to revised EORTC criteria. Infections were graded as severe (requiring systemic treatment) or life threatening (hypotension/organ support). Results: Sixty adults with B-NHL received Tisagen (n=19) or Axicel (n=41). Patients did not receive prophylactic antibiotics. IVIG was given for hypogammaglobulinaemia with recurrent infections (n=4). Within 28 days of infusion, 44 episodes of infection occurred in 28 patients (47%). Post day 28 (range 29-452), 19 episodes occurred in 9 patients (15%). Severe (n=9) and life-threatening (n=7) infection occurred in 15% and 12% of patients respectively, with two infections resulting or contributing to death (3.3%). Infections were bacterial (56%), respiratory viral (24%), other viral (14%) and fungal (6%). Six (10%) developed viral reactivations;CMV (n=1), BK virus in blood or urine (n=2), HHV6 (n=1) or AdV (n=2). PCR proven JC virus causing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy was reported in 1 patient at day 116. Only one late COVID-19 infection occurred despite the program remaining operational throughout lockdown. There was no association between early infection and CRS severity (p=0.43), or use (p=0.94) and dose of Tocilizumab (p=0.54). With regard to pre-treatment variables, advanced disease at time of infusion (≥stage 3) was associated with higher risk of any infection (OR 4.2, 95% CI 1.3- 13.4, p=0.016) and lines of prior therapy (≥3) with higher risk of early infection (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.0-8.9, p=0.048). Steroid treatment was associated with a higher risk of early (and overall) infection (OR 3.0. 95% CI 1.0-8.6, p=0.048). A diagnosis of ICANS was associated with infection beyond day 30 (p=0.021). In multivariate analyses, steroid use (p=0.03) and ≥3 lines of prior therapy (p=0.021) were associated with infection ≤28 days of infusion. Steroid use (p= 0.049) and stage pre infusion (p=0.023) were associated with higher risk of any infection. Conclusion: In this real world analysis of B-NHL patients treated with Tisagen or Axicel, 47% developed early infection at ≤28 days. Severe or life-threatening infection occurred in 27% of patients. Multivariate analysis confirms significant association with (1) steroid exposure (2) ≥stage 3 disease and (3) ≥3 lines of previous therapy. There was no overt association with Tocilizumab use or CRS severity. Unlike other centers, our cohort did not receive prophylactic antibiotics or IVIG. Patients with advanced disease are high risk for CRS, ICANS and infectious complications. Risk modification strategies include bridging optimization to reduce disease burden pre CAR T with infectious prophylaxis from referral until at least 3-6 months post-infusion. In this analysis, steroids represent a significant ri k and efforts should be made to wean doses swiftly. The use of steroid sparing agents such as Anakinra may be important (clinical trial results awaited). In ≥ stage 3 disease or heavily pre-treated patients, there may be a role for prophylactic antibiotics but this should be explored within a clinical study with consideration of local antimicrobial resistance patterns.

Mann–Whitney analysis was used to determine the difference of eosinophil counts in COVID-19 patients who require treatment in ICU and non-ICU. Receiver operating curve analysis was used to determine the diagnostic value of eosinophil count to predict the need of COVID-19 patients for treatment in ICU. RESULTS: There is a significant difference in the absolute and percentage eosinophil count in COVID-19 patients who need treatment in ICU and non-ICU. The area under the curve of absolute and percentage eosinophil count to predict the need of COVID-19 patients for treatment in ICU is 0.659 and 0.738, respectively. The best cutoff value, sensitivity and specificity of absolute and percentage eosinophil count is <0.025 × 103 µL and <0.25%;77.7% and 78.3%;and 50.0% and 57.1%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The eosinophil count can be used as a biomarker to predict the need of COVID-19 patients for treatment in ICU. © 2021 Ngakan Ketut Wira Suastika, Ketut Suega.","Suastika, N. K.

The unique technology which meets the current requirement of highly secured sensitive data available to all authorized person is Blockchain Technology. Blockchain is expounded as distributed decentralized ledger, maintains the non-modifiable ledger at all nodes in the network. In this paper, we proposed blockchain technology-based framework that can be deployed for generating and issuing the epass to improve the availability of sensitive data to the authorized person for effective controlled movement between the country.

Doxycycline, with its pleiotropic effects, including anti-viral activity, has been proposed as a therapeutic candidate for COVID-19 and about twenty clinical trials have started since the beginning of the pandemic. To gain information on the activity of doxycycline against SARS-CoV-2 infection and clarify some of the conflicting clinical data published, we designed in vitro binding tests and infection studies with a pseudotyped virus expressing the spike protein, as well as a clinically isolated SARS-CoV-2 strain. Doxycycline inhibited the transduction of the pseudotyped virus in Vero E6 and HEK-293 T cells stably expressing human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 but did not affect the entry and replication of SARS-CoV-2. Although this conclusion is apparently disappointing, it is paradigmatic of an experimental approach aimed at developing an integrated multidisciplinary platform. To avoid wasting precious time and resources we believe very stringent experimental criteria are needed in the preclinical phase, including infectious studies with SARS-CoV-2 in the platform before moving on to [failed] clinical trials. Author Summary The pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has created a completely unusual situation in rapidly searching for compounds able to interfere with the biological processes exploited by the virus. This new scenario has substantially changed the timing of drug development which has also resulted in the generation of controversial results, proving that the transition from computational screening to the clinical application requires great caution and careful studies. It is therefore necessary to establish new paradigms for evaluating the efficacy of a potential active molecule. We set up a preclinical platform aimed at identifying molecules active against SARS-CoV-2 infection developing a multidisciplinary approach based on very stringent experimental criteria, comprising in-silico studies, in vitro binding tests and infection studies with pseudovirus expressing the spike protein as well as clinically isolated SARS-CoV-2 strains. We focused our attention on doxycycline which has been suggested as potential therapeutic candidate for treating COVID-19 and is currently employed in about twenty clinical trials. Doxycycline resulted effective in inhibiting the transduction of pseudovirus but it did not affect the entry and replication of SARS-CoV-2. The results obtained underline the need to define more stringent and controlled pharmacological approaches before wasting precious time and resources with clinical trials.","Diomede, Luisa; Baroni, Sara; De Luigi, Ada; Piotti, Arianna; Lucchetti, Jacopo; Fracasso, Claudia; Russo, Luca; Bonaldo, Valerio; Panini, Nicolò; Filippini, Federica; Fiordaliso, Fabio; Corbelli, Alessandro; Beeg, Marten; Pizzato, Massimo; Caccuri, Francesca; Gobbi, Marco; Biasini, Emiliano; Caruso, Arnaldo; Salmona, Mario",bioRxiv,423,20

Promoting the adaptive abilities of socio-economic systems becomes an urgent task. We propose to use the experience of various countries in combating the pandemic to analyze the conditions that help to respond effectively to various unforeseen challenges, which are often referred to as ""black swans"" in modern literature. We present a brief review of the literature that analyzes the differences between countries, which affect their economic development amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. We prove that, contrary to popular belief, the continued growth of GDP can be combined with relatively low COVID-19 mortality rates. This conclusion is based on data from 30 countries for the year 2020. We note that the share of the service sector in the economy has a significant impact on the dynamics of GDP in the context of the pandemic. We focus on the relationship between changes in GDP in 2020 and institutional circumstances. We find that it is possible to curb the decline in GDP growth rates primarily in those countries where the population trusts the government. The decline in GDP in some countries under consideration occurs against the background of relatively high information and personal freedom that contributes to a decline in the level of trust in the government in the context of the pandemic. The regression analysis confirms that almost half of the differences between countries in GDP dynamics in 2020 are negatively related to two factors: COVID-19 mortality and information freedom. If the people have no trust in the government, then the efforts it undertakes to adapt to an emergency situation may prove ineffective, and social activity can become destructive. In the future, it would be useful to compare the adaptive capacity of countries in terms of the rate of recovery of their economies after the pandemic.","Dementiev, V.

In tackling the COVID-19 pandemic, there is an implicit trade-off between the economy and the reduction in the number of cases and deaths by the virus. If governmental restrictions to combat the pandemic are very strong, the economy could be seriously damaged. Conversely, if restrictions are very mild to minimize economic losses, it would be very difficult to stop the spread of the virus. It is necessary to find an optimization model to support government decisions balancing the impacts of COVID-19 in health and economic aspects. In this paper, we propose a methodology to find out the optimal number of days per contingency phase, in such a way that public health is prioritized and the damage to the economic impact is reduced. Then, our methodology is applied to one of the most densely populated areas in the world, Mexico City. Our methodology uses an SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed) model to simulate the evolution of the pandemic, and it can be implemented utilizing either a genetic algorithm or a Deep Q-Learning algorithm. For the experiments, we propose two scenarios in which the number of days for each phase is predicted within a 120-day period. The first experiment guarantees that the number of beds is not exceeded, considering the economic impact less relevant. By contrast, the second experiment reduces the number of days in which beds are exceeded as long as the economic losses are not higher than 20%, prioritizing the economy. According to the experiments, the implementation based on genetic algorithms has a higher performance.","Miralles-Pechuan, L.; Ponce, H.; Martinez-Villasenor, L.",Ieee Latin America Transactions,423,22

We investigated the association between preoperative suPAR levels and intraoperative sublingual microvascular perfusion in patients undergoing elective major non-cardiac surgery. Methods: This study included 100 patients undergoing major non-cardiac surgery between February 2019 and September 2020. The primary objective was to investigate the association between preoperative suPAR and intraoperative sublingual De Backer score, Consensus Proportion of Perfused Vessels (Consensus PPV), and Consensus PPV (small). Secondary objectives were to investigate the associations between these sublingual microcirculatory variables and (1) complications and (2) mean arterial pressure. EDTA blood was collected before induction of anesthesia and plasma suPAR levels were determined using the suPARnostic quick triage lateral flow assay. Sublingual microcirculation was monitored with Sidestream DarkField (SDF+) imaging technique at 20 minutes after induction of anesthesia before surgical incision (baseline) and then every 30 minutes until emergence from anesthesia. Results: A decrease of 0.7 mm-1 in the De Backer score, 2.5% in the Consensus PPV, and 2.8% in the Consensus PPV (small) from baseline measurement was observed for every 1 ng/ml increase of suPAR or 1 additional minute of intraoperative time. De Baker score did not change significantly from baseline (p=0.404), while Consensus PPV and Consensus PPV (small) decreased significantly from baseline (p<0.001 in both cases). The De Backer score, the Consensus PPV, and the Consensus PPV (small) correlated with postoperative complications. Mean arterial pressure correlated with De Backer score (p=0.487) but not with Consensus PPV (p=0.506) or Consensus PPV (small) (p=0.697) during the intraoperative period.

Out of 550 surveys filled, we analysed 545 valid surveys. The mean age of the respondents was 21.66 (+or-2.55) years, with 81.7% female (445) and 18.3% male (100). 91.6% of the respondents declared that they were never diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder. Coffee was used on a daily basis by 53.8% of the students, with tobacco coming in second in 19.4%. Female students perceived a higher level of stress and showed a higher level of burnout. Female students scored higher for the anxiety and fear related to Covid-19. Medical students with mental health history scored higher on perceived stress, burnout, anxiety and fear related to COVID-19. Perceived stress indicated a level of moderate stress regardless of the mental history status. For all students, the burnout value indicated that some attention was needed, as they might had been candidates to burnout. Moreover, students diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder during the pandemic showed signs that they were on the road to burnout, with changes needed to be done at the time. There were statistically significant positive correlation, of various degrees between perceived stress, burnout, anxiety and fear related to COVID-19, with the strongest one observed for the perceived stress and burnout, in Romanian medical students.","Armean, K.

Publicly available data and news reports were used to gauge the general public's reaction to these policies and how the Philippines' responses fare with its Southeast Asian neighbors. The paper observes that despite the innovations made by Philippine HEIs in terms of alternative learning modes and technologies for delivering education, there are still gaps and challenges in their responses. It recommends that policy-responses and learning innovations should be grounded on a deeper understanding of distance education and should be sensitive to the call of the times.","Joaquin, J. J.

In our study, we aimed to compare the numbers and demographic data of patients who were treated and followed up during the pandemic period in our burn intensive care center with the data of patients in the same period one year prior. Methods: The patients who were admitted to our tertiary pediatric burn center were divided into two groups: pandemic period (March 10-September 30, 2020) and pre-pandemic period (March 10-September 30, 2019). The groups were compared in terms of age, gender, city of origin, means of transport to the hospital, total burn surface area, burn etiology, duration of hospitalization, intubation status, and mortality from their medical records. Results: In the pandemic period group, 414 children were admitted to the pediatric burn unit and 126 (30.4%) were hospitalized;however, in the pre-pandemic period group, 728 children were admitted to the pediatric burn unit and 98 (13.4%) were hospitalized (p<0.01).

Hence, identifying the molecular basis of processes that reinforce host defensive strategies to eliminate intracellular pathogens is of utmost significance. Pathogenic intrusion activates autophagy and phagocytic pathways that culminate in the lysosome, a vital organelle responsible for pathogen clearance. The transcription factor TFEB plays a pivotal role in autophagy-lysosomal function. Although TFEB is an emerging transcription factor in the field of immune signaling pathways, its role in infectious diseases remains contentious. Recent evidence suggests that infection with certain bacterial and viral pathogens causes TFEB, which is normally located in the cytoplasm, to translocate to the nucleus. There, it activates the transcription of genes that trigger the autophagy-lysosomal and inflammatory pathways to target intracellular pathogens. It is known that some pathogens modulate TFEB to establish themselves inside the host;in some cases, pathogens restrict TFEB to the cytoplasm, whereas in others, functional TFEB fuels pathogen survival and replication. However, the key regulators and molecular mechanisms that decide the outcome of TFEB function during intracellular infection are not clear. In this Review, we attempt to dissect the complex functions of TFEB in host-pathogen interactions and explore the suitability of TFEB as a therapeutic target of clinical relevance.","Keerti, Pant A.; Manjithaya, R.",Journal of Cell Science,423,1

The FLIR temperature scanner has long been used in public places, such as airports, train terminals, business establishments, factories, and skin surface measurements, as an effective tool and Elevated Body Temperature (EBT) Is helpful in identifying individuals. Affected by the global outbreak of Corona virus disease (COVID-19), it has been officially identified as an epidemic. Society is deeply concerned about the spread of infection, and is eventually looking for tools to stop the spread of the virus. The FLIR camera can be used as a screening tool to detect the increased skin temperature in the highest traffic public places through rapid individual screening. If the skin temperature is found above the average temperature in major body locations, such as the corner of the eye, and forehead, then the individual may be selected for additional screening. It is necessary to identify individuals with EBT, who should then be sent to a virus-specific diagnostic testing center for examination. This may help in reducing the spread of viruses, and infections. All the methods available to measure body temperature are all based on edge detection. These methods are very sensitive to noise, and in these the system of noise reduction is quite complex. Therefore, an automated method is being introduced to measure the temperature of the corner of the Eye and Forehead using the ""salt and pepper"" and ""colormap"" method, which is less complex, and still has high accuracy.","Tiwari, S.; Parsai, M.

Objective: To assess the course of illness and final outcome in patients who received RDV at various stages of illness, and compare it to the non-RDV group. Methods: This is a retrospective data analysis of 1262 COVID-19 patients hospitalized from May5, 2020 to August 31, 2020. The primary outcomes were progression to mechanical ventilation (MV) or death. Kaplan Meier survival analysis and log rank test were used for evaluating primary outcomes. Results: 398 patients comprised the RDV group and 260 patients comprised the non-RDV group. 2/3rd of patients were above 50 years of age in both the groups and 3/4th patients were male. Mortality rate was 5.8% in RDV group (10.4% in non-RDV group). Mortality rate was 3.6%, 4% and 16.7% when RDV was started within 5 days, 5 to 10 days and after 10 days of symptom onset respectively. Fewer patients in RDV group progressed to MV (4.0% v/s 8.2%). Earlier discharge occurred in RDV group. Use of supplemental oxygen was observed in 44.7% patients in RDV group (54.2% in non-RDV group).

To evaluate the level and persistence of NAbs induced by two inactivated COVID-19 vaccines in China. Methods and findings Serum samples were collected from 1,335 people aged 18 and over who were vaccinated with COVID-19 inactivated vaccine in Peking University People's Hospital from January 19 to June 23, 2021, for detection of COVID-19 antibodies. The WHO standard of SARS-CoV-2 NAbs was detected. The coefficients of variation between the detection results and the true values of the NAbs detected by the WHO standard were all lower than the WHO international standard 3% after the dilution of the original and the dilution of the theoretical concentrations of 500 IU/mL, 250 IU/mL, 125 IU/mL, 72.5 IU/mL, 36.25 IU/mL and 18.125 IU/mL. On day 11-70, the positive rate of NAbs against COVID-19 was 82% to 100%; From day 71 to 332, the positive rate of NAbs decreased to 27%. The level of NAbs was significantly higher at 3-8 Weeks than at 0-3 Weeks. There was a high linear correlation between NAbs and IgG antibodies in 1335 vaccinated patients. NAbs levels were decreased in 31 of 38 people (81.6%) at two time points after the second dose of vaccine. There was no significant difference in age between the group with increased and decreased neutralizing antibody levels (x2 =-0.034, P>0.05). The positive rate of NAbs in the two-dose vaccine group (77.3%) was significantly higher than that in the one-dose group (18.1%), with statistical difference (x2=312.590, P<0.001). A total of 206 people who were 11-70 days after receiving the second dose were tested and divided into three groups: 18-40 years old, 41-60 years old and >60 years old. The positive rates of NAbs in three groups (18-40 years old, 41-60 years old and >60 years old) were 95.14%, 78.43% and 81.8%, respectively. The positive rate of NAbs was significantly higher in 18-40 years old than in 41-60 years old (x2=12.547, P <0.01). The titer of NAbs in 18-40 years old group was significantly higher than that in 41-60 years old group (t=-0.222, P <0.01). The positive rate of NAbs in male group (89.32%) was lower than in female (91.26%), but there was no significant difference (x2=0.222, P >0.05). Conclusions The positive rate of NAbs was the highest from 10 to 70 days after the second dose of vaccine, and the positive rate gradually decreased as time went by. There was a high linear correlation between COVID-19 NAbs and IgM/IgG antibodies in vaccinators, suggesting that in cases where NAbs cannot be detected, IgM/IgG antibodies can be detected instead. The level of NAbs produced after vaccination was affected by age, but not by gender. The highest levels of NAbs were produced between shots 21 to 56 days apart, suggesting that 21 to 56 days between shots is suitable for vaccination.","Zhang, H.; Jia, Y.; Ji, Y.; Cong, X.; Liu, Y.; Yang, R.; Kong, X.; Shi, Y.; Zhu, L.; Wang, Z.; Wang, W.; Fei, R.; Liu, F.; Lu, F.; Chen, H.; Rao, H.",,423,6

One of the crucial areas in the international community's response relates to accelerating research and knowledge sharing. The aim of this article is to map and characterise the existing empirical research related to COVID-19 in LAC countries and contribute to identify opportunities for strengthening future research. Methods In this scoping review, articles published between December 2019 and 11 November 2020 were selected if they included an empirical component (explicit scientific methods to collect and analyse primary data), LAC population was researched, and the research was about the COVID-19 pandemic, regardless of publication status or language. MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, Scielo, CENTRAL and Epistemonikos were searched. All titles and abstracts, and full texts were screened by two independent reviewers. Data from included studies was extracted by one reviewer and checked by a second independent reviewer. Results 14,406 records were found. After removing duplicates, 5,458 titles and abstracts were screened, of which 2,323 full texts were revised to finally include 1,626 empirical studies. The largest portion of research came from people/population of Brazil (54.6%), Mexico (19.1%), Colombia (11.2%), Argentina (10.4%), Peru (10.3%) and Chile (10%), while Caribbean countries concentrated 15.3%. The methodologies most used were cross-sectional studies (34.7%), simulation models (17.5%) and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (13.6%). Using a modified version of WHO's COVID-19 Coordinated Global Research Roadmap classification, 54.2% were epidemiological studies, followed by clinical management (22.3%) and candidate therapeutics (12.2%). Government and public funds support were reported in 19.2% of studies, followed by universities or research centres (9%), but 47.5% did not include any funding statement. Conclusion During the first part of the COVID-19 pandemic, LAC countries have contributed to the global research effort primarily with epidemiological studies, with little participation on vaccines research, meaning that this type of knowledge would be imported from elsewhere. Research agendas could be further coordinated aiming to enhance shared self-sufficiency regarding knowledge needs in the region.","Mansilla, C.; Herrera, C. A.; Boeira, L.; Yearwood, A.; Lopez, A.

To help policymakers interested in further enhancing primary care delivery of COVID-19 vaccines, it is important to estimate the absolute number of vaccination opportunities, and identify how these opportunities may fall disproportionately among different communities given the unequal way that COVID-19 falls upon communities of color, low-income, and rural communities. To quantify the potential benefits of greater primary care engagement in vaccination efforts, we estimated the number of potential vaccination opportunities (PVOs) in primary care in the remaining calendar months of year 2021, and the possible uptake if we supplied enough vaccine to primary care practices to fulfill their opportunities. To estimate how many potential vaccination opportunities (PVOs) may occur in primary care, we used three sets of data, analyzing the latest available waves of the following: (i) the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS, 2016, N = 677 providers); (ii) the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS, 2018, N = 29,839 individuals in 29,839 households); and (iii) the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS, 2018, N = 40,025 individuals in 14,500 households). Per the NAMCS data, which provide a nationally-representative sample of ambulatory care visits, primary care physicians normally provide 40.2 million primary care visits per month. The majority of the primary care utilization is absorbed by those aged 16 to 64 years old who are not otherwise priority groups (i.e., not having chronic diseases as defined by ACIP) but the second large group of visits are those with a chronic disease (27.2% of all visits). As compared to the NAMCS data providing an estimate of care from the perspective of providers, the overall sample in NHIS provides a view of primary care access and utilization from a population perspective. Per NHIS, 34% of the civilian US population saw a generalist physician in the prior calendar year, or 109.8 million people. Overall, we would estimate that over the latter half of calendar year 2021, approximately 15 million potential vaccine opportunities would be available through US primary care practices.","Basu, S.; Weintraub, R.; Ganguli, I.; Phillips, R.; Bitton, A.",,423,23

We performed a systems biology analysis of samples from the Immunization by Mosquito with Radiation Attenuated Sporozoites IMRAS) trial, which comprised P. falciparum RAS-immunized (PfRAS), malaria-naive participants whose protection from malaria infection was subsequently assessed by controlled human malaria infection (CHMI). Blood samples collected after initial PfRAS immunization were analyzed to compare immune responses between protected and non-protected volunteers leveraging integrative analysis of whole blood RNA-seq, high parameter flow cytometry, and single cell CITEseq of PBMCs. This analysis revealed differences in early innate immune responses indicating divergent paths associated with protection. In particular, elevated levels of inflammatory responses early after the initial immunization were detrimental for the development of protective adaptive immunity. Specifically, non-classical monocytes and early type I interferon responses induced within 1 day of PfRAS vaccination correlated with impaired immunity. Non-protected individuals also showed an increase in Th2 polarized T cell responses whereas we observed a trend towards increased Th1 and T-bet+ CD8 T cell responses in protected individuals. Temporal differences in genes associated with natural killer cells suggest an important role in immune regulation by these cells. These findings give insight into the immune responses that confer protection against malaria and may guide further malaria vaccine development.","Du, Ying; Hertoghs, Nina; Duffy, Fergal J.; Carnes, Jason; McDermott, Suzanne M.; Neal, Maxwell L.; Schwedhelm, Katharine V.; McElrath, M.

Each component of f represents the fraction of time in which an individual spends engaging in the corresponding behavior. The evolution equation is an integro-differential equation on the D-simplex. The model is capable of describing the ""superspreader"" phenomenon in terms of behavior spread rates, as opposed to terms of individual infectivity.

Mexico leads worldwide childhood-obesity rankings representing an epidemic problem for public health. To this date, it is still unclear how the gut phageome, the bacteriophage component of the virome, influences childhood obesity and obesity with metabolic syndrome. We characterized the gut phageome of 28 school-age children with healthy normal-weight (NW), obese (O), and obese with metabolic syndrome (OMS) profiles, using metagenomic sequencing of virus-like particles (VLPs) from fecal samples. Viromes derived from VLPs were mainly dominated by Caudovirales, and only Inoviridae family was significantly increased in obesity. The three groups showed a similar number of VLPs, while a significant increase in phage richness and diversity was found in obesity groups compared NW. Few phage contigs dominated the phageome composition in NW, being increased in obesity groups. Interestingly, the majority of the phageome was shared among all individuals, establishing a core and common phageome, which abundances correlated with anthropometric and biochemical traits and bacteria previously associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome. We also established a healthy core phageome shared in >80% of NW samples, with a decreased prevalence in the O and OMS groups. Our data support that changes in the gut phageome may contribute to obesity and metabolic syndrome development via bacterial dysbiosis.

The same clinic templates which existed for face-to-face encounters have been retrospectively adapted, without consideration of any potential difference in duration of consultations. Rheumatology practitioners from a variety of clinical backgrounds work alongside the rheumatology consultants, providing clinical care to patients with both inflammatory arthritis and connective tissue disease. Objectives: To record the duration of all scheduled telephone consultations carried out by advances rheumatology practitioners in a 4-week period. Methods: All scheduled telephone clinic encounters over a 4-week period were timed and the duration recorded in a spreadsheet. Data was collected in real time by all 8 rheumatology advanced practitioners working within the rheumatology department of a district general hospital, following each clinic episode. Results: Data was recorded from a total of 337 clinic appointments. Of these, 317 (94%) were booked as routine, 3 (0.9%) as urgent, 4 (1.2%) were expedited following an advice line contact, and 13 (3.9%) no data was recorded. 28 (8%) of the patients did not answer when contacted. 80 (24%) clinic appointments lasted 15 minutes or less, 186 (55%) lasted 16 -30 minutes, 37 (11%) lasted 31 -45 minutes, and 6 (2%) lasted 46 -60 minutes. The average duration was 22 minutes. Conclusion: Within this department, remote consultations appear to have a similar duration when compared against the traditional clinic template for a fully faceto-face clinic, with some encounters lasting significantly longer than the planned duration. This would appear to differ to telephone consultations used in other settings, such as general practice where the duration is reportedly shorter1. This may be representative of the additional complexity and co-morbidity of a typical rheumatology patient, or due to the multi-faceted nature of a rheumatology follow-up appointment2. Although remote consultations are effective in limiting risk of exposure to Covid-19, they may not offer a quicker or more efficient service compared with the face-to-face model. Further study in this field is required to evaluate this widely adopted new pattern of working.","Parker, L.; Coldstream, F.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,423,16

Various techniques have been used together with convolution neural network to prepare voice data before the training process in developing the classification model. However, not all model can produce good classification accuracy as there are many types of voice or speech. Classification of Arabic alphabet pronunciation is a one of the types of voice and accurate pronunciation is required in the learning of the Qur'an reading. Thus, the technique to process the pronunciation and training of the processed data requires specific approach. To overcome this issue, a method based on padding and deep learning convolution neural network is proposed to evaluate the pronunciation of the Arabic alphabet. Voice data from six school children are recorded and used to test the performance of the proposed method. The padding technique has been used to augment the voice data before feeding the data to the CNN structure to developed the classification model. In addition, three other feature extraction techniques have been introduced to enable the comparison of the proposed method which employs padding technique. The performance of the proposed method with padding technique is at par with the spectrogram but better than mel-spectrogram and mel-frequency cepstral coefficients. Results also show that the proposed method was able to distinguish the Arabic alphabets that are difficult to pronounce. The proposed method with padding technique may be extended to address other voice pronunciation ability other than the Arabic alphabets. © 2021 University of Baghdad.

Aim To develop and test a smartphone-based algorithm for diagnosing CAP without need for clinical examination or radiology inputs. Design and Setting A prospective cohort study using data from subjects aged over 12 years presenting with acute respiratory symptoms to a hospital in Western Australia. Method Five cough audio-segments were recorded and four patient-reported symptoms (fever, acute cough, productive cough, age) were analysed by the smartphone-based algorithm to generate an immediate diagnostic output for CAP. We recruited independent cohorts to train and test the accuracy of the algorithm. Diagnostic agreement was calculated against the confirmed discharge diagnosis of CAP by specialist physicians. Specialist radiologists reported medical imaging. Results The algorithm had high percent agreement (PA) with the clinical diagnosis of CAP in the total cohort (n=322, Positive PA=86%, Negative PA=86%, AUC=0.95); in subjects 22-65 years (n=192, PPA=86%, NPA=87%, AUC=0.94) and in subjects >65 years (n=86, PPA=86%, NPA=87.5%, AUC=0.94). Agreement was preserved across CAP severity: 85% (80/94) of subjects with CRB-65 scores 1-2, and 87% (57/65) with a score of 0, were correctly diagnosed by the algorithm. Conclusion The algorithm provides rapid and accurate diagnosis of CAP. It offers improved accuracy over current protocols when clinical evaluation is difficult. It provides increased capabilities for primary and acute care, including telehealth services, required during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Porter, P.; Brisbane, J.; Abetratne, U.; Bear, N.; Wood, J.; Peltonen, V.; Della, P.; Smith, C.; Claxton, S.",,423,1

In this paper we present the following new results on the Erd\H{o}s-Selfridge function $g(k)$: We present a new algorithm to compute the value of $g(k)$, and use it to both verify previous work and compute new values of $g(k)$, with our current limit being $$ g(323)= 1\ 69829\ 77104\ 46041\ 21145\ 63251\ 22499. $$ We define a new function $\hat{g}(k)$, and under the assumption of our Uniform Distribution Heuristic we show that $$ \log g(k) = \log \hat{g}(k) + O(\log k) $$ with high""probability"". We also provide computational evidence to support our claim that $\hat{g}(k)$ estimates $g(k)$ reasonably well in practice. There are several open conjectures on the behavior of $g(k)$ which we are able to prove for $\hat{g}(k)$, namely that $$ 0.525\ldots +o(1) \quad \le \quad \frac{\log \hat{g}(k)}{k/\log k} \quad \le \quad 1+o(1), $$ and that $$ \limsup_{k\rightarrow\infty} \frac{\hat{g}(k+1)}{\hat{g}(k)}=\infty.$$ Let $G(x,k)$ count the number of integers $n\le x$ such that $p(\binom{n}{k})>k$. Unconditionally, we prove that for large $x$, $G(x,k)$ is asymptotic to $x/\hat{g}(k)$.

A complete solution having all variety of applications was essentially needed through which students can attend lectures from their home as well in this pandemic era. A cost-effective solution was developed named as automated class lecture recording system, utilizing a low-cost minimal effort card, single sized board PC. The proposed research provides a platform through which students can attend and revise high quality lectures in their preferred time. The proposed research comprises of raspberry pi, operating system (noobs), pi-cam and framework. Videos were recorded and streamed using Pi cam. Raspberry pi was programmed in such a way that it is capable to process all data i.e., video frames and audio packets in an asynchronous way and at the end videos and audio are merged. After completion of lecture, recording the sound and video documents can be combined and sent to the referred/desired storage device from where instructor can upload it to location or on dedicated site from where students can access it. Thus, the proposed system, provided benefit to students if someone is absent or not attending lecture due to illness or some other reasons. The proposed research also provides the solution of increasing number of expenses for students as it can save travel expenses and accommodation costs. Although there are so many competitive solutions are available for the class lecture recording system but these systems cannot be acknowledged as cost-effective solution. Moreover, some free solutions are there but they don't provide high quality and merging mechanism with the video of the instructor and lecture as well. Therefore, the proposed research can be considered as the most cost effective and efficient solution for traditional class room teachings.

The statistical models are developed with a view to the autoregressive distributed lag co-integration technique for estimation. The findings of the study conclude that fiscal decentralization has a direct and indirect impact in eradicating poverty. We thus conclude that the government should provide autonomy to the provinces in Pakistan, as the central government alone cannot tackle and understand the local problems. Therefore, the government must adopt a fiscal decentralization policy.

Objectives: We present an analysis of the COVID-19 incidence and outcomes in 126 AAV pts treated with rituximab (RTX) from one rheumatology center registry. Methods: Data were collected with telephone/online surveying between 11-15th November 2020 from all 126 AAV pts (58-granulomatosis with polyangiitis, GPA;38-microscopic polyangiitis, MPA;22-eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, EGPA (54% ANCA-negative);and 8-uncertain AAV). Pts age was 51 (20-81) yr, 62% women. Due to AAV activity or risk of relapse, during the pandemic RTX was prescribed in 48% pts. Results: The incidence of COVID-19 in AAV pts was 3.5% during the first 3 months of the pandemic, the course was uneventful, and all pts recovered. Since September 2020 a 4-fold increase in the incidence alongside with more severe course of COVID-19 were reported. After 8 months of the pandemic, COVID-19 was diagnosed in 21 (16.6%) pts with median age 55 yr, 57% women. COVID-19 incidence was lower in GPA (15.5%) vs MPA (21.1%) or EGPA (27.7%). The mortality rate was 14.3% (2-MPA, 1-GPA). When analyzing the 5-year survival rate of AAV pts treated with RTX, prognosis worsening was noted;in 2020 there were 3 deaths due to COVID-19, in the previous 5 years-only 2 deaths. Conclusion: Taking into account the fact the mechanisms of AAV and severe COVID-19 are largely synergistic (Table 1), primarily in the context of obstructive thromboinflammation as manifestation of acute inflammatory syndrome in COVID-19 [1], AAV can potentially contribute to the severe course of COVID-19. Anti-CD20 therapy seems to have a protective effect against severe COVID-19 [2], which, however, can be insufficient in AAV pts with active disease and multiple organ damage.

This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of laboratory parameters in predicting cases with positive RT-PCR for COVID-19. METHODS: This diagnostic accuracy study was conducted on suspected COVID-19 patients, who presented to Behpooyan Clinic Medical center in Tehran (Iran) from 22 February to 14 March, 2020. Patients were divided into two groups based on the results of real time reverse transcriptase‐polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for COVID-19, and the accuracy of different laboratory parameters in predicting cases with positive RT-PCR was evaluated using area under the ROC curve (AUC). RESULTS: Two hundred cases with the mean age of 41.3± 14.6 (range: 19-78) years were studied (0.53% male). The result of RT-PCR for COVID-19 was positive in 70 (35%) cases. Patients with positive RT-PCR had significantly higher neutrophil (NEU) count (p = 0.0001), and C-reactive protein (CRP) (p = 0.04), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (p = 0.0001), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (p = 0.001), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (p = 0.0001), and Urea (p = 0.001) levels in serum. In addition, patients with positive RT-PCR had lower white blood cell (WBC) count (p = 0.0001) and serum albumin level (p = 0.0001) compared to others.

A total of 41 samples from 37 patients were positive by this method. During the winter months of 2001, up to 8% of specimens submitted for respiratory virus testing were hMPV positive. Sequencing data of the hMPV M gene revealed that two genogroups of the virus, each of which can be divided into two subgroups, cocirculated during this time period. A case-controlled study was conducted to compare the symptoms associated with hMPV infection with those involving other etiologic agents causing ARTI. Symptoms most frequently observed in hMPV-positive patients were cough, wheezing, and dyspnea, although the symptomatology could differ substantially from patient to patient. No distinct symptom profile could be associated with hMPV. Three nosocomial cases of hMPV infection were identified.

Proteolytic processing of the RV NSP ORF translation product p200 is essential for viral replication. Processing of p200 to two mature products (p150 and p90) in the order NH(2)-p150-p90-COOH is carried out by an RV-encoded protease residing in the C-terminal region of p150. The RV nonstructural protease (NS-pro) belongs to a viral papain-like protease family that cleaves the polyprotein both in trans and in cis. A conserved X domain of unknown function was found from previous sequence analysis to be associated with NS-pro. To define the domains responsible for cis- and trans-cleavage activities and the function of the X domain in terms of protease activity, an in vitro translation system was employed. We demonstrated that the NSP region from residue 920 to 1296 is necessary for trans-cleavage activity. The domain from residue 920 to 1020 is not required for cis-cleavage activity. The X domain located between residues 834 and 940, outside the regions responsible for both cis- and trans-cleavage activities of NS-pro, was found to be important for NS-pro trans-cleavage activity but not for cis-cleavage activity. Analysis of sequence homology and secondary structure of the RV NS-pro catalytic region reveals a folding structure similar to that of papain.","Liang, Y; Yao, J; Gillam, S",Journal of virology,423,16

Rapid reductions in the time to diagnosis and effective facilities for the isolation of cases are essential to ensure that there will not be a large outbreak, and each week of delay in responding to imported infection approximately doubles the total number of cases.

The objectives of this study were to establish whether alcohol risk consumption varied during COVID-19 confinement, and how these variations manifested as a function of different sociodemographic variables. METHODS The study was conducted during confinement with 3,779 participants in Spain. We used an online survey with sociodemographic variables (sex, age and employment situation) and AUDIT-C. Frequency and mean difference analysis were performed (Student t, ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis) to establish intra-group variations before the pandemic compared to during confinement, and intergroup for each time period, reporting effect size. RESULTS Alcohol risky consumption presented high prevalence rates before confinement (25,9% of alcohol consumers), showing a general decrease during confinement (15,1%), both in men (X2=224,829; p<0,001) and women (X2=214,324; p<0,001). Women had higher risk consumption rates both before the pandemic (X2=13,124; p<0,001; d=1,067) and during confinement (X2=26,316; p<0,001; d=2,85); however, men reported higher score in AUDIT-C before the pandemic (t(2343)=-7,887; p<0,001; d=0,322) and during confinement (t(2343)=-5,664; p<0,001; d=0,231). Considering age, significant differences in prevalence among groups were found before the pandemic (X2=22,889; p<0,001) and during confinement (X2=38,302; p<0,001), with the age range 18-24 showing less prevalence. Differences among age groups were also found in the risky consumption scores during confinement (F(5,2338)=43,849; p=0,001), increasing with age. With regards to the employment situation, differences before the pandemic (KW(5,2933)=13,467; p=0,019; E2R=0,44), and during confinement (KW(5,2933)=149,818; p<0,001; E2R=0,51) were also found. Self-employed workers showed a higher score in alcohol risky consumption with respect to full-time employees (p=0,047). CONCLUSIONS The alcohol risky consumption decreased in a generalized way during the confinement by COVID-19, but the changes in prevalence and risk index were dependent on sociodemographic variables. It is recommended that these findings are considered in the design of public health policies and strategies.","Villanueva, Víctor J; Motos, Patricia; Isorna, Manuel; Villanueva, Verónica; Blay, Pere; Vázquez-Martínez, Andrea",Revista espanola de salud publica,423,1

The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of minimum and maximum rise time and inspiratory cycling criteria settings on 6 new generation ventilators. Our hypothesis was there would be a difference in the exhaled tidal volume, inspiratory time, and peak flow among 6 different ventilators, based, on change in rise time and cycling criteria. METHODS The research utilized a breathing simulator and 4 different ventilator models. All mechanical ventilators were set to a spontaneous mode of ventilation with settings of pressure support 8 cm H2O and PEEP of 5 cm H2O. A minimum and maximum setting for rise time and cycling criteria were examined. Exhaled tidal volume, inspiratory time, and peak flow measurements were recorded for each simulation. RESULTS Significant (P < .001) differences were found when comparing minimum and maximum rise time and minimum and maximum cycling criteria for each ventilator. CONCLUSIONS Significant differences in exhaled tidal volume, inspiratory time, and peak flow were observed by adjusting rise time and cycling criteria. This research demonstrates that during pressure support ventilation strategy, adjustments in rise time and/or cycling criteria can produce changes in inspiratory parameters. Obviously, this finding has important implications for practitioners who utilize a similar pressure support strategy when conducting a ventilator wean. Additionally, this study outlines major differences among ventilator manufacturers when considering inspiratory rise time and cycling criteria.","Gonzales, Joshua F; Russian, Christopher J; Gregg Marshall, S; Collins, Kevin P",Respiratory care,423,9

DESIGN Prospective observational study. ANIMALS 275 purebred cats from 6 private catteries and 40 specific-pathogen-free (SPF) laboratory-reared cats. PROCEDURE 40 SPF cats were experimentally inoculated with crude fecal extract containing feline enteric coronavirus (FECV). Fecal and plasma samples were collected every 4 days and evaluated by use of RT-PCR and indirect immunofluorescence assays, respectively, to correlate RT-PCR results with fecal infectivity and to determine patterns of FECV shedding and anti-FECV IgG production in acutely infected cats. The 275 cats in private catteries were monitored for 1 year. Fecal and blood samples were collected every 1 to 3 months and assayed by use of RT-PCR and serologic tests to determine patterns of coronavirus shedding and cofactors for high frequency shedding. RESULTS Results of the RT-PCR test in SPF cats were directly correlated with fecal extract infectivity. Overall, 370 of 894 (41%) fecal samples collected from cattery and shelter cats contained infectious levels of coronavirus. Of 121 cats from which multiple samples were collected, 11 never shed virus and 35, 65, and 10, respectively, shed virus with low, moderate, and high frequency. High frequency shedding was associated with age and cattery of origin, but not with sex or concurrent disease. Stress associated with parturition and lactation did not induce shedding in queens. Kittens did not shed coronavirus before they were 10 weeks old, even when nursed by shedding mothers. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS A large proportion of cats in multiple-cat environments shed coronavirus at any given time, but most undergo cycles of infection and shedding, recovery, and reinfection. Infection is acquired from chronically shedding cats and from infectious cats undergoing transient primary infection. Chronically shedding cats cannot be identified on the basis of antibody titer or signalment, but must be identified on the basis of the results of serial fecal RT-PCR tests.","Foley, J E; Poland, A; Carlson, J; Pedersen, N C",Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,423,1

Death from SARS is most often due to rapidly progressive respiratory compromise (acute respiratory distress syndrome, ARDS) and subsequent multi-organ dysfunction. However, the mechanisms evoking respiratory distress and a fulminant systemic response remain unclear. In order to elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms of SARS, we analyzed clinical manifestations and levels of serum cytokines of SARS patients. METHODS Fourteen hospitalized patients with a diagnosis of SARS-associated coronavirus infection at National Taiwan University Hospital from March to May 2003 were included. Data on clinical manifestations, parameters of laboratory tests, complications and final outcomes of patients were collected retrospectively. Serial plasma inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) of preserved serum were measured by enzyme immunoassay. RESULTS All 14 patients had fever, dry cough and dyspnea. Twelve were intubated during hospitalization. The median duration from onset of fever to the nadir level or most severe condition was 9 days for hypoxia, 7 days for lymphocytopenia, 6.5 days for thrombocytopenia, 9.5 days for maximal pulmonary infiltrates; to peak serum levels was 9 days for C-reactive protein (CRP), 10.5 days for IL-6, 13.5 days for IL-8 and 12 days for TNF-alpha; to defervescence was 13 days. There was no significant elevation of serum IL-1beta levels in any of the 14 patients. There were no significant differences in peak levels of IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha between patients with and without ARDS. The 8 patients who died tended to have higher peak levels of serum TNF-alpha compared to those who survived (14 vs 9.1 pg/mL; p = 0.06). CONCLUSION Rapid elevation of inflammatory cytokines-IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha might play a role in the development of SARS-related ARDS. The timing of elevations in inflammatory cytokines and CRP is correlated with progression of pulmonary infiltrates of SARS patients. The peak level of serum TNF-alpha tends to be higher in patients who die of SARS than in those who survive. Our results indicate that CRP and TNF-alpha might be used as prognostic markers of SARS.","Sheng, Wang-Huei; Chiang, Bor-Luen; Chang, Shan-Chwen; Ho, Hung-Nern; Wang, Jann-Tay; Chen, Yee-Chun; Hsiao, Cheng-Hsiang; Hseuh, Po-Ren; Chie, Wei-Chu; Yang, Pan-Chyr",Journal of the Formosan Medical Association = Taiwan yi zhi,423,1

An additional 22 virus sequences were retrieved from GenBank. Fragments of the glycoprotein G(L) and the replicase genes were amplified by RT-PCR, prior to sequencing and construction of phylogenetic trees. The trees revealed many distinctive lineages, consistent with prolonged diversification within geographically separated host populations. Two large groups and five subgroups were distinguished. Group I consisted mainly of viruses from North America, whilst group II consisted mainly of European isolates. In most instances, where the geographic origin of the viruses appeared to be at variance with the phylogenetically predicted relationships, the horses from which the viruses were recovered had been transported between Europe and America or vice versa. Analysis of the replicase gene revealed similar phylogenetic relationships although not all of the groups were as clearly defined. Virus strains CH1 (Switzerland, 1964) and S1 (Sweden, 1989) represented separate 'outgroups' based on analysis of both genomic regions. The results of this study confirm the value of the G(L) gene of EAV for estimating virus genetic diversity and as a useful tool for tracing routes by which EAV is spread.

Conformational neutralizing epitopes of group A and group B monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) have previously been mapped to two domains at amino acids 351 to 403 (domain I) and amino acids 517 to 621 (domain II). To further map antigenic sites, neutralization escape mutants of BCV were selected with a group A MAb which has both in vitro and in vivo virus-neutralizing ability. The escape mutants were demonstrated to be neutralization resistant to the selecting group A MAb and remained sensitive to neutralization by a group B MAb. In radioimmunoprecipitation assays, the spike proteins of neutralization escape mutants were shown to have lost their reactivities with the selecting group A MAb. Sequence analysis of the spike protein genes of the escape mutants identified a single nucleotide substitution of C to T at position 1583, resulting in the change of alanine to valine at amino acid position 528 (A528V). The mutation occurs in domain II and in a location which corresponds to the hypervariable region of the spike protein of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus. Experimental introduction of the A528V mutation into the wild-type spike protein resulted in the loss of MAb binding of the mutant protein, confirming that the single point mutation was responsible for the escape of BCV from immunological selective pressure.","Yoo, D; Deregt, D",Clinical and diagnostic laboratory immunology,423,21

As a result, there is little practical guidance for healthcare institutions that are forced to weigh whether or when to exclude healthcare providers from providing care or allow them to opt out from providing care to protect themselves.

The stress axis and production of stress hormones (corticosteroids) regulates ESD in fish, but evidence of a similar influence in reptiles is sparse and conflicting. The central bearded dragon (Pogona vitticeps) has a system of sex determination involving the interplay between sex chromosomes (ZZ/ZW female heterogamety) and the thermal environment. High egg incubation temperatures induce sex reversal of the ZZ genotype, feminizing chromosomally male individuals. Here we show that corticosterone elevation is not associated with sex reversal in the central bearded dragon, either during embryonic development or adulthood. We also demonstrate experimentally that sex determination is not affected by corticosterone injection into the yolk. This strongly suggests that stress axis upregulation by high temperature during incubation does not cause sex reversal in P. vitticeps. Our work is in general agreement with other research in reptiles, which suggests that the stress axis does not mediate sex in reptiles with ESD.

Currently, the standard paradigm for HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) is based on central air systems that tie delivery of heating and cooling to delivery of fresh air. To prevent heat loss, the delivery of fresh air must be tightly controlled and often limited through recirculation of already heated air. Buildings are designed with air-tight envelopes, which do not allow for natural ventilation, and depend on energy-intensive central-air systems. As closed environments, buildings have become sites of rapid COVID-19 transmission. In this research, we demonstrate the energy cost of increasing outdoor air supply with standard systems per COVID-19 recommendations and introduce an alternative HVAC paradigm that maximizes the decoupling of ventilation and thermal control. We first consider a novel analysis of the energy costs of increasing the amount of conditioned fresh air using standard HVAC systems to address COVID-19 concerns. We then present an alternative that includes a novel membrane-assisted radiant system we have studied for cooling in humid climates, in place of an air conditioning system. The proposed system can work in conjunction with natural ventilation and thus decreases the risk of indoor spread of infectious diseases and significantly lowers energy consumption in buildings. Our results modeling HVAC energy in different climates show increased outdoor air in standard HVAC systems can double cooling costs, while increasing natural ventilation with radiant systems can halve HVAC costs. More specifically it is possible to add up to 100 days' worth of natural ventilation while saving energy, when coupling natural ventilation and radiant systems. This combination decreases energy cost by 10-45% in 60 major cities globally, while increasing fresh air intake.","Aviv, Dorit; Wee Chen, Kian; Teitelbaum, Eric; Sheppard, Denon; Pantelic, Jovan; Rysanek, Adam; Meggers, Forrest",Appl Energy,423,24

We sought to elucidate the effect of empagliflozin as an add-on therapy on decongestion and renal function in patients with type 2 diabetes admitted for acute decompensated heart failure. METHODS: The study was terminated early due to COVID-19 pandemic. We enrolled 59 consecutive patients with type 2 diabetes admitted for acute decompensated heart failure. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either empagliflozin add-on (n=30) or conventional glucose-lowering therapy (n=29). We performed laboratory tests at baseline and 1, 2, 3, and 7 days after randomization. Percent change in plasma volume between admission and subsequent time points was calculated using the Strauss formula. RESULTS: There were no significant baseline differences in left ventricular ejection fraction and serum NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide), hematocrit, or serum creatinine levels between the 2 groups. Seven days after randomization, NT-proBNP level was significantly lower in the empagliflozin group than in the conventional group (P=0.040), and hemoconcentration (&#8805;3% absolute increase in hematocrit) was more frequently observed in the empagliflozin group than in the conventional group (P=0.020). The decrease in percent change in plasma volume between baseline and subsequent time points was significantly larger in the empagliflozin group than in the conventional group 7 days after randomization (P=0.017). The incidence of worsening renal function (an increase in serum creatinine &#8805;0.3 mg/dL) did not significantly differ between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: In this exploratory analysis, empagliflozin achieved effective decongestion without an increased risk of worsening renal function as an add-on therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes with acute decompensated heart failure.

In contexts of collective adversity, health care providers who are also members of these communities share and interdependently affect the range of responses their patients have. We aim to conceptualize this spectrum, termed shared trauma, shared resilience, and shared growth. Method: In this metasynthesis, we review the literature on these underacknowledged dynamics globally. We include prior conceptualizations of direct and indirect trauma, collective trauma, cultural context, and the COVID-19 pandemic toward clearer conceptualization of shared mental health in global collective stressor contexts. Results: Most trauma and resilience research focuses on prevailing concepts and measures with questionable cross-cultural applicability. These works usually center on acute, highly distressing threats to physical safety at the individual level. The scarce literature on shared trauma describes it as a rare phenomenon, entailing conflicting messages of narrative accounts within contexts of few cultures with medium to high degrees of individualism. There has been little consideration of other non-Western and indigenous communities with more collectivist values and collective trauma histories. There is limited understanding of these concepts as they pertain to the vast majority of cultures. As a result, shared trauma, resilience, and growth have been poorly conceptualized, differentiated, or empirically researched. Conclusions: We propose uniquely inclusive models of shared trauma, resilience, and growth. These models reflect the cumulative effects and interplay of direct to indirect, acute to chronic, individual to collective, and historic to transgenerational factors influenced by cultural context.

These electret layers are essential for the efficient filtration of difficult-to-capture small particles, yet the exact nature of electrostatic capture with respect to the charge on both the particles and the electret fibres as well as the effect of the immediate environment remain unclear. Here, we explore in detail the electrostatic interactions between the surface of a single charged electret fibre and a model of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Using Poisson-Boltzmann electrostatics coupled to a detailed spike protein charge regulation model, we show how pH and salt concentration drastically change both the scale and the sign of the interaction. Furthermore, the configuration of the few spike proteins closest to the electret fibre turns out to be as important for the strength of the interaction as their total number on the virus envelope, a direct consequence of spike protein charge regulation. The results of our work elucidate the details of virus electrostatics and contribute to the general understanding of efficient virus filtration mechanisms.","Javidpour, Leili; BoZic, AnZe; Naji, Ali; Podgornik, Rudolf",Soft Matter,423,10

In this study, we investigated the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on stroke care across China. METHODS: Data from the Big Data Observatory Platform for Stroke of China consisting of 280 hospitals across China demonstrated a significant drop in the number of cases of thrombolysis and thrombectomy. We designed a survey to investigate the major changes during the COVID-19 outbreak and potential causes of these changes. The survey was distributed to the leaders of stroke centers in these 280 hospitals. RESULTS: From the data of Big Data Observatory Platform for Stroke of China, the total number of thrombolysis and thrombectomy cases dropped 26.7% (P<0.0001) and 25.3% (P<0.0001), respectively, in February 2020 as compared with February 2019. We retrieved 227 valid complete datasets from the 280 stroke centers. Nearly 50% of these hospitals were designated hospitals for COVID-19. The capacity for stroke care was reduced in the majority of the hospitals. Most of the stroke centers stopped or reduced their efforts in stroke education for the public. Hospital admissions related to stroke dropped &#8776;40%; thrombolysis and thrombectomy cases dropped &#8776;25%, which is similar to the results from the Big Data Observatory Platform for Stroke of China as compared with the same period in 2019. Many factors contributed to the reduced admissions and prehospital delays; lack of stroke knowledge and proper transportation were significant limiting factors. Patients not coming to the hospital for fear of virus infection was also a likely key factor. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 outbreak impacted stroke care significantly in China, including prehospital and in-hospital care, resulting in a significant drop in admissions, thrombolysis, and thrombectomy. Although many factors contributed, patients not coming to the hospital was probably the major limiting factor.

However, patients developing acute secretory syndromes due to functional neuroendocrine neoplasms (such as of the pancreas, intestine or lung), phaeochromocytomas and paragangliomas, will require prompt treatment. Patients with life-threatening Covid-19-related symptoms should be urgently treated and long-term anti-tumoral treatments may be temporarily delayed. In patients with especially aggressive NENs, a careful judgement should be made regarding the severity of any Covid-19 illness, tumour grade, and the immunosuppressant effects of any planned chemotherapy, immunotherapy (e.g. interferon-alpha), targeted therapy or related treatment. In other cases, especially patients with completely resected NENs, or who are under surveillance for a genetic disorder, a telephone or delayed consultation may be in order, balancing the risk of a delay against that of the possible development of Covid-19.","Casey, Ruth T; Valk, Gerlof D; Schalin-Jäntti, Camilla; Grossman, Ashley B; Thakker, Rajesh V",Eur J Endocrinol,423,16

A century apart, these two pandemics have devastated the world. The advances in health and science over the past hundred years have proved only partially effective against the current pandemic. At the moment, the therapeutic strategies to deal with the infection are only supportive and prevention is aimed at reducing transmission in the community. This outbreak is more than an intensive care phenomenon, rather it is a public health and humanitarian crisis. Western health care systems have been built around the concept of patient-centred care but a pandemic requires a change of perspective toward a concept of community-centred care. Malta has painfully learned this the hard way. This paper examines the sources of variability during both pandemics in shaping the morbidity experience of the Maltese islands which in turn allows for a better understanding of how developments of isolation, exposure, history and physical distancing could play important roles in shaping the epidemic experience.","Scerri, Mariella; Grech, Victor",Early Hum Dev,423,16

Single variable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify mortality-related factors. We combined multiple factors to predict mortality, which was validated by receiver operating characteristic curves. As a result, in a total of 336 patients, 34 (10.1%) patients died during hospitalisation. Through multivariable logistic regression, we found that decreased lymphocyte ratio (Lymr, %) (odds ratio, OR 0.574, P < 0.001), elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (OR 1.513, P = 0.009), and raised D-dimer (DD) (OR 1.334, P = 0.002) at admission were closely related to death. The combined prediction model was developed by these factors with a sensitivity of 100.0% and specificity of 97.2%. In conclusion, decreased Lymr, elevated BUN, and raised DD were found to be in association with death outcomes in critically ill patients with COVID-19.

But, it should be done using the most appropriate specimen and an accurate diagnostic test such as real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Therefore, a systematic review was conducted to determine the positive detection rate of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in different clinical specimens using qRT-PCR. A total of 8136 pooled clinical specimens were analyzed to detect SARS-CoV-2, the majority were nasopharyngeal swabs (69.6%). A lower respiratory tract (LRT) specimens had a positive rate (PR) of 71.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 60.3%-82.3%) while no virus was detected in the urinogenital specimens. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BLF) specimen had the PR of 91.8% (95% CI: 79.9%-103.7%), followed by rectal swabs; 87.8% (95% CI: 78.6%-96.9%) then sputum; 68.1% (95% CI: 56.9%-79.4%). A low PR was observed in oropharyngeal swabs; 7.6% (95% CI: 5.7%-9.6%) and blood samples; 1.0% (95% CI: -0.1%-2.1%) whereas no SARS-CoV-2 was detected in urine samples. Feces had a PR of 32.8% (95% CI:1 5.8%-49.8%). Nasopharyngeal swab, a widely used specimen had a PR of 45.5% (95% CI: 31.2%-59.7%). In this study, SARS-CoV-2 was highly detected in LRT specimens while no virus was detected in urinogenital specimens. BLF had the highest PR followed by rectal swab then sputum. Nasopharyngeal swab which is widely used had moderate PR. Low PR was recorded in oropharyngeal swab and blood samples while no virus was found in urine samples.

Here, we report the first real-time nanoscale observation of chemical OER on Mn2O3 nanocatalyst surface using an in situ liquid holder in a transmission electron microscope (TEM). The oxygen evolution process can be directly visualized from the development of oxygen nanobubbles around nanocatalysts. The high spatial and temporal resolution further enables us to unravel the real-time formation of a surface layer on Mn2O3, whose thickness oscillation reflects a partially reversible surface restructuring relevant to OER catalysis. Ex situ atomic-resolution TEM on the residual surface layer after OER reveals its amorphous nature with reduced Mn valence and oxygen coordination. Besides shedding light on the dynamic OER catalysis, our results also demonstrate a powerful strategy combining in situ and ex situ TEM for investigating various chemical reaction mechanisms in liquid.","Zhao, Guangming; Yao, Yunduo; Lu, Wei; Liu, Guanyu; Guo, Xuyun; Tricoli, Antonio; Zhu, Ye",Nano lett,423,21

Following European and local guidelines, Italian endoscopy units modulated their activity. We aimed at analyzing the need and safety to continue selective colorectal cancer screening (CRCS) colonoscopies during the COVID-19 pandemic.

A pre/post endoscopic sanitary surveillance for COVID-19 infection was organized for patients and sanitary staff. RESULTS: In the lockdown group, 60 of 137 invited patients underwent endoscopy, whereas in the control group, 238 CRCS colonoscopies (3.9-fold) were performed. In the lower number of examinations during the lockdown, we found more colorectal cancers (5 cases; 8% vs. 3 cases; 1%; P = .002). The ""high-risk"" adenomas detection rate was also significantly higher in the ""lockdown group"" than in controls (47% vs. 25%; P = .001). A multiple regression analysis selected relevant symptoms (hazard ratio [HR], 3.1), familiarity (HR, 1.99), and lockdown period (HR, 2.2) as independent predictors of high-risk lesions (high-risk adenomas and colorectal cancer). No COVID-19 infections were reported among staff and patients.

We present a case of a 22-year-old healthy patient with COVID-19 who developed a pulmonary embolism with a pulmonary infarction, a complication that results from arterial and venous thrombosis of the pulmonary vascular supply resulting in tissue necrosis.","Islam, Younes Alyacoub Ramez Nwachukwu Onyeka Sah Anuraag Remolina Carlos",Journal of Community Hospital Internal Medicine Perspectives,423,21

Given the modifiable nature of electronic cigarettes and the delivery of high concentrations of nicotine, we investigate whether electronic cigarette vaping has the potential to increase susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We exposed BEAS-2B cells (bronchial epithelium transformed with Ad12-SV40 2B) and primary small airway epithelial cells (SAECs) to electronic cigarette aerosol condensates produced from propylene glycol/vegetable glycerin or commercially bought e-liquid (±added nicotine) and cigarette smoke extract to investigate if electronic cigarette exposure, like cigarette smoke, increases the expression of ACE2 in lung epithelial cells. In BEAS-2B cells, cytotoxicity (CCK-8), membrane integrity (LDH), and ACE2 protein expression (immunofluorescence) were measured for both 4- and 24 h treatments in BEAS-2B cells and 4 h in SAECs; ACE2 gene expression was measured using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for 4 h treatment in BEAS-2B cells. Nicotine-free condensates and higher concentrations of nicotine-containing condensates were cytotoxic to BEAS-2B cells. Higher LDH release and reduced membrane integrity were seen in BEAS-2B cells treated for 24 h with higher concentrations of nicotine-containing condensates. ACE2 protein expression was observably increased in all treatments compared to cell controls, particularly for 24 h exposures. ACE2 gene expression was significantly increased in cells exposed to the locally bought e-liquid condensate with high nicotine concentration and cigarette smoke extract compared with cell controls. Our study suggests that vaping alone and smoking alone can result in an increase in lung ACE2 expression. Vaping and smoking are avoidable risk factors for COVID-19, which, if avoided, could help reduce the number of COVID-19 cases and the severity of the disease. This is the first study to utilize electronic cigarette aerosol condensates, novel and developed in our laboratory, for investigating ACE2 expression in human airway epithelial cells.","McAlinden, Kielan Darcy; Lu, Wenying; Ferdowsi, Parisa Vahidi; Myers, Stephen; Markos, James; Larby, Josie; Chia, Collin; Weber, Heinrich C; Haug, Greg; Eapen, Mathew Suji; Sohal, Sukhwinder Singh",,423,22

In addition, overburdening of health system led to an increase in mortality due to the scarcity of adequate medical care, at the same time confinement measures could have contributed to the decrease in mortality from certain causes. Our aim is to compare the number of deaths observed in 2020 with the projection for the same period obtained from a sequence of previous years. Thus, this computed mortality excess could be considered as the real impact of the COVID-19 on the mortality rates. METHODS: The population was split into four age groups, namely: (< 50; 50-64; 65-74; 75 and over). For each one, a projection of the death numbers for the year 2020, based on the interval 2008-2020, was estimated using a Bayesian spatio-temporal model. In each one, spatial, sex, and year effects were included. In addition, a specific effect of the year 2020 was added (""outbreak""). Finally, the excess deaths in year 2020 were estimated as the count of observed deaths minus those projected. RESULTS: The projected death number for 2020 was 426,970 people, the actual count being 499,104; thus, the total excess of deaths was 72,134. However, this increase was very unequally distributed over the Spanish regions. CONCLUSION: Bayesian spatio-temporal models have proved to be a useful tool for estimating the impact of COVID-19 on mortality in Spain in 2020, making it possible to assess how the disease has affected different age groups accounting for effects of sex, spatial variation between regions and time trend over the last few years.","Saavedra, Pedro; Santana, Angelo; Bello, Luis; Pacheco, José-Miguel; Sanjuán, Esther",Popul Health Metr,423,21

However, this phenomenon demands attention also in areas where media and patients were focused on the COVID-19 pandemic, but the healthcare system was not overwhelmed by the huge number of COVID-19 patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this observational study, we compared the incidence rate of all consecutive STEMI patients admitted at the University Hospital of Trieste, Italy, during March and April 2020 with the same 2 months of the previous 5 years (2015-2019). Patient characteristics were compared between 2020 and 2019.The incidence rate of STEMI admission in March-April 2020 was lower than those in March-April 2015-2019, 36 vs. 56 cases per 100â000âinhabitants/year [relative risk (RR) 0.65, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.42-0.96, Pâ=â0.045]. Considering that the incidence rates were constant in the past years (Pâ=â0.24), the turnaround in 2020 is most likely due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Interestingly, this reduction was a dynamic phenomenon with a U-shaped curve during the 2-month period. System-of-care times were similar between 2020 and 2019; however in 2020, patients presented more frequently signs of heart failure compared to 2019 (Killip class &#8805;2 in 68% vs. 29%, Pâ=â0.003). CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 outbreak, we observed a marked reduction in the STEMI incidence rate. This U-shaped phenomenon demands attention because a potential cause for the decrease in STEMI incidence may include the avoidance of medical care. Public campaigns aiming to increase awareness of ischemic symptoms may be needed during community outbreak.","Fabris, Enrico; Bessi, Riccardo; De Bellis, Annamaria; Gregorio, Caterina; Peratoner, Alberto; Lardieri, Gerardina; Cominotto, Franco; Vitrella, Giancarlo; Rakar, Serana; Perkan, Andrea; Sinagra, Gianfranco",J Cardiovasc Med (Hagerstown),423,1

In this special article, we address the question of how to confront an epidemic of immobility within a pandemic. We identify 4 specific problems for creating and advancing a culture of mobility posed by COVID-19: social distancing and policies restricting patient movement, personnel constraints, PPE shortages, and increased patient hesitancy to ambulate. We also propose 4 specific solutions to address these problems. These approaches will help support a culture of healthy mobility during and after hospitalization and help patients to keep moving during the pandemic and beyond.","Pereira, Daniel E; Welch, Sarah A; Montgomery, Chandler D; Hatcher, Jeremy B; Duggan, Mariu C; Greysen, S Ryan",Age ageing,423,32

This study discusses the incorporation of various polymeric dielectric layers between the tribo-material and electrode components of TENGs, which improved their electrical output performance to varying degrees. The TENG demonstrating the largest improvement (1200 V) was obtained after adding a polyimide layer. The analysis presented herein suggests that incorporating a dielectric layer with high trap energy means that more charges are held in deep traps; thus, such TENGs demonstrate the best electrical performance. Additionally, when a dielectric layer is added to the triboelectric material, the enhanced TENG output is related to the volume conductivity of the triboelectric material, but not to its electronegativity or surface structure. Finally, the optimized TENG developed in this work demonstrates energy harvesting capabilities and can function as a self-powered sensor applied in an intelligent housing system and as an emergency fall detection/alert system for the elderly and the sick.","Lv, Shasha; Zhang, Xin; Huang, Tao; Yu, Hao; Zhang, Qinghua; Zhu, Meifang",ACS appl. mater. interfaces (Online),423,24

They significantly impact the quality of life of the patient. They are one of the most common causes of benign biliary strictures, which can result in serious complications such as recurrent cholangitis or secondary biliary cirrhosis. Although LC is a common operation today, the incidence of BDIs associated with LC is twice that of BDIs resulting from open cholecystectomies. CASE REPORT: In this paper, we present a case report of a patient after LC with the Class III-D injury according to the Stewart-Way classification. The injury was a result of a misleading description from a preoperative ultrasonography and a subsequent misunderstanding of the anatomical conditions of a patient with congenital gallbladder agenesis. The BDI was recognised first day after surgery. Thanks to a prompt transfer to our centre the patient was in a good condition. Biliary reconstruction could be done because there was no serious inflammation or biliary peritonitis at the time of reoperation. Due to the extent of the injury a Roux-en-Y tri-hepaticojejunostomy combined with external transhepatic biliary drains was performed. CONCLUSION: Iatrogenic BDI after a LC is a rare, but potentially life-threatening complication. The main risk factor is the presence of anatomical variants of the biliary tract. Early recognition and treatment in a department with adequately experienced hepatobiliary specialists are crucial for a positive outcome. The most frequent surgical treatment is a Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy.","Drs, A; Kocík, M; Chlupac, J; Fronek, J",Rozhl Chir,423,20

Although the main clinical manifestations are respiratory, an increase in neurological conditions, specifically acute cerebrovascular disease, has been detected. We present cerebrovascular disease case incidence in hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients were confirmed by microbiological/serological testing, or on chest CT semiology. Available data on co-morbidity, laboratory parameters, treatment administered, neuroimaging, neuropathological studies and clinical evolution during hospitalization, measured by the modified Rankin scale, were analysed. A bivariate study was also designed to identify differences between ischaemic and haemorrhagic subtypes. A statistical model of binary logistic regression and sensitivity analysis was designed to study the influence of independent variables over prognosis. In our centre, there were 1683 admissions of patients with COVID-19 over 50 days, of which 23 (1.4%) developed cerebrovascular disease. Within this group of patients, cerebral and chest CT scans were performed in all cases, and MRI in six (26.1%). Histological samples were obtained in 6/23 cases (two brain biopsies, and four arterial thrombi). Seventeen patients were classified as cerebral ischaemia (73.9%, with two arterial dissections), five as intracerebral haemorrhage (21.7%), and one leukoencephalopathy of posterior reversible encephalopathy type. Haemorrhagic patients had higher ferritin levels at the time of stroke (1554.3 versus 519.2, P = 0.004). Ischaemic strokes were unexpectedly frequent in the vertebrobasilar territory (6/17, 35.3%). In the haemorrhagic group, a characteristic radiological pattern was identified showing subarachnoid haemorrhage, parieto-occipital leukoencephalopathy, microbleeds and single or multiple focal haematomas.

Three additional farms were recruited via a press release published in agricultural newsletters. Of 76 farms contacted, 37 chose to participate in this study from June to July 2020.Results: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, dairies have implemented or increased biosecurity measures and COVID-19 precautions. Dairies reported adequate personal protective equipment for their workers, though face masks were not required on most dairies (n=32, 86%). Producers were concerned about the safety of their families, maintaining a healthy workforce, and keeping their farms profitable. Access to healthcare was not perceived to be an issue for their workers. One-quarter of dairies reported COVID-19 infections on their farms. Even though the majority had an isolation protocol in place if someone on the farm were to become ill, less than half of respondents felt their farm was protected against COVID-19. Two-thirds of producers have not had to decrease production, and a majority of operations have not furloughed or terminated employees due to COVID-19.Conclusions: Our data suggest that dairy farms in Minnesota and Wisconsin have implemented biosecurity and safety measures in response to COVID-19. These measures can be improved. Farms would benefit from additional guidance and education on implementation of personal protective measures and disease prevention strategies to keep workers employed and safe.","Mung Ting Yung, Sally; Vázquez, Rosa Chela; Liebman, Amy; Brihn, Auguste; Olson, Anna; Loken, Delaney; Contreras-Smith, Ana; Bender, Jeff; Kirsch, Jonathan",J. agromed.

OBJECTIVES: To construct a comprehensive model to predict perioperative RBC transfusion in patients undergoing isolated CABG using adjusted preoperative variables. METHODS: Perioperative data of 1253 patients who underwent isolated CABG by the same surgical team were collected from April 2018 to March 2019. Logistic regression analyses were used to establish equations to construct two models for predicting intraoperative and postoperative RBC transfusions, respectively. All significant variables included in the two models were combined to form a comprehensive model to predict perioperative RBC transfusion. Area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the discriminatory power of the models. RESULTS: The total RBC transfusion rate for CABG patients during hospitalization was 29.05%. The rate of intraoperative and postoperative RBC transfusions was 6.9% and 26.7%, respectively. Eight variables in a total of 30 risk factors constituted the intraoperative prediction model, 12 variables constituted the postoperative prediction model, and 13 variables for the combined model. The AUC of the three models were 0.87, 0.82, and 0.83, respectively, demonstrating moderate discriminatory power for RBC transfusion during the intraoperative, postoperative, and perioperative periods. CONCLUSION: The comprehensive model combined with all variables of predicting intraoperative and postoperative RBC transfusion is feasible for predicting perioperative RBC transfusion.","Lu, Liangyuan; Che, Ji; Xie, Wuxiang; Cheng, Weiping; Yang, Zhanmin; Dong, Ran; Huang, Jiapeng; Lu, Jiakai",Gen. thorac. cardiovasc. surg,423,1

An integer derivative model has been proposed initially and then the formula for calculating basic reproductive number, R 0 of the model has been presented. Cameroon has been considered as a representative for the developing countries and the epidemic threshold, R 0 has been estimated to be ~ 3.41 ( 95 % CI : 2.2 - 4.4 ) as of July 9, 2020. Using real data compiled by the Cameroonian government, model calibration has been performed through an optimization algorithm based on renowned trust-region-reflective (TRR) algorithm. Based on our projection results, the probable peak date is estimated to be on August 1, 2020 with approximately 1073 ( 95 % CI : 714 - 1654 ) daily confirmed cases. The tally of cumulative infected cases could reach ~ 20, 100 ( 95 % CI : 17 , 343 - 24 , 584 ) cases by the end of August 2020. Later, global sensitivity analysis has been applied to quantify the most dominating model mechanisms that significantly affect the progression dynamics of COVID-19. Importantly, Caputo derivative concept has been performed to formulate a fractional model to gain a deeper insight into the probable peak dates and sizes in Cameroon. By showing the existence and uniqueness of solutions, a numerical scheme has been constructed using the Adams-Bashforth-Moulton method. Numerical simulations have enlightened the fact that if the fractional order &#945; is close to unity, then the solutions will converge to the integer model solutions, and the decrease of the fractional-order parameter (0 < &#945; < 1) leads to the delaying of the epidemic peaks.","Nabi, Khondoker Nazmoon; Abboubakar, Hamadjam; Kumar, Pushpendra",Chaos Solitons Fractals,423,21

Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted at outpatient departments of nine hospitals and health centers 14 February-2 March 2020. Self-administered questionnaires were used to assess patient characteristics, health literacy, clinical information, health-related behaviors, and depression. A sample of 928 participants aged 60-85 years were analyzed. Results: The proportion of people with S-COVID-19-S and depression were 48.3 and 13.4%, respectively. The determinants of health literacy in groups with and without S-COVID-19-S were age, gender, education, ability to pay for medication, and social status. In people with S-COVID-19-S, one-score increment of health literacy was associated with 8% higher healthy eating likelihood (odds ratio, OR, 1.08; 95% confidence interval, 95%CI, 1.04, 1.13; p < 0.001), 4% higher physical activity likelihood (OR, 1.04; 95%CI, 1.01, 1.08, p = 0.023), and 9% lower depression likelihood (OR, 0.90; 95%CI, 0.87, 0.94; p < 0.001). These associations were not found in people without S-COVID-19-S. Conclusions: The older people with higher health literacy were less likely to have depression and had healthier behaviors in the group with S-COVD-19-S. Potential health literacy interventions are suggested to promote healthy behaviors and improve mental health outcomes to lessen the pandemic's damage in this age group.","Do, Binh N; Nguyen, Phung-Anh; Pham, Khue M; Nguyen, Hoang C; Nguyen, Minh H; Tran, Cuong Q; Nguyen, Thao T P; Tran, Tien V; Pham, Linh V; Tran, Khanh V; Duong, Trang T; Duong, Thai H; Nguyen, Kien T; Pham, Thu T M; Hsu, Min-Huei; Duong, Tuyen Van",Front Public Health,423,24

COVID-19 forecasts have received much media attention, and numerous platforms have been created to inform the public. However, forecasting effectiveness varies by geographic scope and is affected by changing assumptions in behaviors and preventative measures in response to the pandemic. Due to time requirements for developing a COVID-19 vaccine, evidence is needed to inform short-term forecasting method selection at county, health district, and state levels. OBJECTIVE: COVID-19 forecasts keep the public informed and contribute to public policy. As such, proper understanding of forecasting purposes and outcomes is needed to advance knowledge of health statistics for policy makers and the public. Using publicly available real-time data provided online, we aimed to evaluate the performance of seven forecasting methods utilized to forecast cumulative COVID-19 case counts. Forecasts were evaluated based on how well they forecast 1, 3, and 7 days forward when utilizing 1-, 3-, 7-, or all prior-day cumulative case counts during early virus onset. This study provides an objective evaluation of the forecasting methods to identify forecasting model assumptions that contribute to lower error in forecasting COVID-19 cumulative case growth. This information benefits professionals, decision makers, and the public relying on the data provided by short-term case count estimates at varied geographic levels. METHODS: We created 1-, 3-, and 7-day forecasts at the county, health district, and state levels using (1) a naïve approach, (2) Holt-Winters (HW) exponential smoothing, (3) a growth rate approach, (4) a moving average (MA) approach, (5) an autoregressive (AR) approach, (6) an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) approach, and (7) an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) approach. Forecasts relied on Virginia's 3464 historical county-level cumulative case counts from March 7 to April 22, 2020, as reported by The New York Times. Statistically significant results were identified using 95% CIs of median absolute error (MdAE) and median absolute percentage error (MdAPE) metrics of the resulting 216,698 forecasts. RESULTS: The next-day MA forecast with 3-day look-back length obtained the lowest MdAE (median 0.67, 95% CI 0.49-0.84, P<.001) and statistically significantly differed from 39 out of 59 alternatives (66%) to 53 out of 59 alternatives (90%) at each geographic level at a significance level of .01. For short-range forecasting, methods assuming stationary means of prior days' counts outperformed methods with assumptions of weak stationarity or nonstationarity means. MdAPE results revealed statistically significant differences across geographic levels. CONCLUSIONS: For short-range COVID-19 cumulative case count forecasting at the county, health district, and state levels during early onset, the following were found: (1) the MA method was effective for forecasting 1-, 3-, and 7-day cumulative case counts; (2) exponential growth was not the best representation of case growth during early virus onset when the public was aware of the virus; and (3) geographic resolution was a factor in the selection of forecasting methods.","Lynch, Christopher J; Gore, Ross",J Med Internet Res,423,16

The initial reaction to this news was to seek out scapegoats and blame individual authors, peer-reviewers, editors, and journals for wrong doing. This paper suggests that scapegoating a few individuals for faulty science is a myopic approach to the more profound problem with peer-review. Peer-review in its current limited form cannot be expected to adequately address the scope and complexity of large interdisciplinary science research collaboration, which is central in translational research. In addition, empirical studies on the effectiveness of traditional peer-review reveal its very real potential for bias and groupthink; as such, expectations regarding the capacity and effectiveness of the current peer review process are unrealistic. This paper proposes a new vision of peer-review in translational science that, on the one hand, would allow for early release of a manuscript to ensure expediency, whereas also creating a forum or a collective of various experts to actively comment, scrutinize, and even build on the research under review. The aim would be to not only generate open discussion and oversight respecting the quality and limitations of the research, but also to assess the extent and the means for that knowledge to translate into social benefit.","Smith, Elise M",Clin Transl Sci,423,10

This study presents a mixed-integer linear programming model for equitable COVID-19 vaccine distribution in developing countries. Vaccines are grouped into cold, very cold, and ultra-cold categories where specific refrigeration is required for their storage and distribution. The possibility of storage for future periods, facing a shortage, budgetary considerations, manufacturer selection, order allocation, time-dependent capacities, and grouping of the heterogeneous population are among the practical assumptions in the proposed approach.

Accordingly, this study aimed to evaluate the incidence of agitation and hyperactive delirium in postcardiotomy patients during the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support and to identify the risk factors for its development. METHODS: This single center, retrospective study was conducted at Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University. Data were extracted from the prospective institutional registry database of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation patients. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to predict risk factors. RESULTS: A total of 170 consecutive adult patients underwent extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in our hospital from January 2016 to December 2017. Ninety-four patients were included in the final analysis. The incidence of agitation and hyperactive delirium was 35% in our population of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation-supported postcardiotomy patients. Agitation and delirium usually occurred within the first 3 days of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Multivariable analysis showed that history of previous stroke (without preoperative cognitive dysfunction; odds ratio, 4.425, 95% confidence interval: 1.171-16.716; p = 0.028) and mean arterial pressure reduction (before extracorporeal membrane oxygenation initiation) â©¾ 49 mmHg (odds ratio, 7.570, 95% confidence interval: 2.366-24.219, p = 0.001) were independent risk factors for agitation and hyperactive delirium during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support.

Less evidence of cross-reactive memory CD8 T cells has been documented to date. Methods We used the NetCTLPan neural network of the Epitope Database and Analysis Resource to select a series of 27 HLA-A*02:01 epitopes derived from the proteome of SARS-CoV-2. Their binding capacity was assessed by a HLA-A*02:01 stabilization assay and by quantifying their binding to HLA-A*02:01 monomers for the generation of tetramers. Their ability to stimulate and induce expansion of SARS-CoV-2 reactive CD8 T cells was measured by flow cytometry. The TCR repertoire of COVID convalescent and healthy unexposed donors was analysed using the MIRA database. Findings The HLA-A*02:01 epitopes tested were able to stabilise HLA molecules and induce activation of CD8 T cells of healthy unexposed donors. Our results, based on specific tetramer binding, provide evidence supporting the presence of frequent cross-reactive CD8 T cells to SARS-CoV-2 antigens in non-exposed individuals. Interestingly, the reactive cells were distributed into naïve, memory and effector subsets. Interpretation Our data are consistent with a significant proportion of the reactive CD8 T clones belonging to the public shared repertoire, readily available in absence of previous contact with closely related coronaviruses. Furthermore, we demonstrate the immunogenic capacity of long peptides carrying T cell epitopes, which can serve to isolate virus-specific T cell receptors among the ample repertoire of healthy unexposed subjects and could have application in COVID-19 immunotherapy. Limitations of our study are that it concentrated on one MHC I allele (HLA-A*02:01) and the low numbers of samples and epitopes tested.","Quiros-Fernandez, Isaac Poorebrahim Mansour Fakhr Elham Cid-Arregui Angel",EBioMedicine,423,21

Our findings propose more caution in the interpretation of RT-PCR data, promoting, instead, also the quantification of age and sex-based risk factors using HRCT images. Statistical analysis of our methodology reveals a direct relation between intensity, skewness and kurtosis of the radiological features and the gender of patients. Moreover, we investigate the effect of the age of patients on the appearance of COVID-19 pneumonia in the HRCT images. We have also applied our methodology to investigate the effect of time on the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia within the lungs. Subsequently, we find a strong relationship between image analysis and the informed medical diagnosis asserted by the radiologists. Additionally, our results also indicate increase in the severity of lung infection in the first and second week after the onset of the SARS-CoV-2 symptoms. Thereafter, a gradual decrease in the lung damage is observed during the third week. The proposed image analysis methodology can be used as a simple complementary tool for infectious disease diagnostics as demonstrated in this study with an example of SARS-CoV-2 to provide better understanding of the disease for drug and vaccine development.","Asadi, Fariba; Shahnazari, Razieh; Bhalla, Nikhil; Payam, Amir Farokh",,423,1

More than 22% of Canadians reported that they had felt depressed in the last week, in response to a December 2020 national survey. Given the need to physically distance during the pandemic, and the increase in demand for mental health services, digital interventions that support mental health and wellness may be beneficial. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this research was to identify digital interventions that could be used to support the mental health of the Canadian general population during the COVID-19 pandemic. The objectives were to identify (1) the populations these interventions were developed for, inclusive of exploring areas of equity such as socioeconomic status, sex/gender, race/ethnicity and culture, and relevance to Indigenous peoples and communities; (2) the effect of the interventions; and (3) any barriers or facilitators to the use of the intervention. METHODS: This study was completed using a Cochrane Rapid Review methodology. A search of Embase, PsycInfo, Medline, and Web of Science, along with Google, Million Short, and popular mobile app libraries, was conducted. Two screeners were involved in applying inclusion criteria using Covidence software. Academic articles and mobile apps identified were screened using the Standard Quality Assessment Criteria for Evaluating Primary Research Papers from a Variety of Fields resource, the American Psychiatric Association App Evaluation Framework, and the Mental Health Commission of Canada's guidance on app assessment and selection. RESULTS: A total of 31 mobile apps and 114 web-based resources (eg, telemedicine, virtual peer support groups, discussion forums, etc) that could be used to support the mental health of the Canadian population during the pandemic were identified. These resources have been listed on a publicly available website along with search tags that may help an individual make a suitable selection. Variability exists in the populations that the interventions were developed for, and little assessment has been done with regard to areas of equity. The effect of the interventions was not reported for all those identified in this synthesis; however, for those that did report the effect, it was shown that they were effective in the context that they were used. A number of barriers and facilitators to using these interventions were identified, such as access, cost, and connectivity. CONCLUSIONS: A number of digital interventions that could support population mental health in Canada during the global COVID-19 pandemic were identified, indicating that individuals have several options to choose from. These interventions vary in their purpose, approach, design, cost, and targeted user group. While some research and digital interventions addressed equity-related considerations, more research and focused attention should be given to this area.","Strudwick, Gillian; Sockalingam, Sanjeev; Kassam, Iman; Sequeira, Lydia; Bonato, Sarah; Youssef, Alaa; Mehta, Rohan; Green, Nadia; Agic, Branka; Soklaridis, Sophie; Impey, Danielle; Wiljer, David; Crawford, Allison",JMIR Ment Health,423,1

Here, we observe Down, one-Up, one-Open, and two-Up-like structures in enhanced molecular dynamics simulations without pre-defined reaction coordinates. The RBDA transition from Down to one-Up is supported by transient salt-bridges between RBDA and RBDC and by the glycan at N343B. Reduced interactions between RBDA and RBDB induce the RBDB motions toward two-Up. Glycan shielding for neutralizing antibodies is the weakest in one-Open. Cryptic pockets are revealed at the RBD interfaces in intermediate structures between Down and one-Up. The inherent flexibility in S-protein is, thus, essential for the structure transition and shall be considered for antiviral drug rational design or vaccine development.","Dokainish, Hisham M.; Re, Suyong; Mori, Takaharu; Kobayashi, Chigusa; Jung, Jaewoon; Sugita, Yuji",,423,26

Recent direct detection assays based on CRISPR-Cas13a1-4 avoid reverse transcription and DNA amplification required of gold-standard PCR assays5, but these assays have not yet achieved the sensitivity of PCR and are not easily multiplexed to detect multiple viruses or variants. Here we show that Cas13a acting on single target RNAs loaded into droplets exhibits stochastic nuclease activity that can be used to enable sensitive, rapid, and multiplexed virus quantification. Using SARS-CoV-2 RNA as the target and combinations of CRISPR RNA (crRNA) that recognize different parts of the viral genome, we demonstrate that reactions confined to small volumes can rapidly achieve PCR-level sensitivity. By tracking nuclease activity within individual droplets over time, we find that Cas13a exhibits rich kinetic behavior that depends on both the target RNA and crRNA. We demonstrate that these kinetic signatures can be harnessed to differentiate between different human coronavirus species as well as SARS-CoV-2 variants within a single droplet. The combination of high sensitivity, short reaction times, and multiplexing makes this droplet-based Cas13a assay with kinetic barcoding a promising strategy for direct RNA identification and quantification.","Son, Sungmin; Lyden, Amy; Shu, Jeffrey; Stephens, Stephanie I; Fozouni, Parinaz; Knott, Gavin J; Smock, Dylan C.J.; Liu, Tina Y; Boehm, Daniela; Simoneau, Camille; Kumar, Renuka; Doudna, Jennifer A; Ott, Melanie; Fletcher, Daniel A",,423,16

Growing evidence indicates that COVID-19 frequently causes coagulopathy, presenting as hypercoagulation and incidental thrombosis. For these reasons, a multifactorial approach with several anticoagulant markers should be considered in the management of anticoagulation using heparin in COVID-19 patients on V-V ECMO. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 48-year-old man was infected with COVID-19 with a worsening condition manifesting as acute respiratory distress syndrome. DIAGNOSES: He was refractory to conventional therapy, thus we decided to introduce V-V ECMO. We used heparin as an anticoagulant therapy for V-V ECMO and adjusted the doses of heparin by careful monitoring of the activated clotting time (ACT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) to avoid both hemorrhagic and thrombotic complications. We controlled the doses of heparin in the therapeutic ranges of ACT and APTT, but clinical hemorrhaging and profound elevation of coagulant marker became apparent. INTERVENTIONS: Using thromboelastography (TEG; Haemonetics) in addition to ACT and APTT, we were able to clearly detect not only sufficient coagulability of COVID19 on V-V ECMO (citrated rapid thromboelastography-R 0.5âmin, angle 75.5°, MA 64.0âmm, citrated functional fibrinogen-MA 20.7âmm) but also an excessive effect of heparin (citrated kaolin -R 42.7âmin, citrated kaolin with heparinase 11.7âmin). OUTCOMES: Given the TEG findings indicating an excessive heparin effect, the early withdrawal of ECMO was considered. After an evaluation of the patient's respiratory capacity, withdrawal from V-V ECMO was achieved and then anticoagulation was stopped. The hemorrhagic complications and elevated thrombotic marker levels dramatically decreased. LESSONS: TEG monitoring might be a useful option for managing anticoagulation in COVID-19 patients on V-V ECMO frequently showing a hypercoagulative state and requiring massive doses of heparin, to reduce both hemorrhagic and thrombotic complications.","Nakashima, Ryosuke; Nishihara, Masaaki; Iyonaga, Takeshi; Iwasaka, Sho; Yamamoto, Yuzo; Shono, Yuji; Maki, Jun; Tokuda, Kentaro; Akahoshi, Tomohiko; Higo, Taiki; Kitazono, Takanari; Tsutsui, Hiroyuki",Medicine (Baltimore),423,1

Curbing the spread of COVID-19 and future pandemics may be accomplished through understanding the environmental context of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and adoption of effective detection tools and mitigation policies. This article aims to examine the latest investigations on SARS-CoV-2 plausible environmental transmission modes, employment of wastewater surveillance for early detection of COVID-19, and elucidating the role of solid waste, water, and atmospheric quality on viral infectivity. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via faecal-oral or bio-aerosols lacks robust evidence and remains debatable. However, improper disinfection and defected plumbing systems in indoor environments such as hospitals and high-rise towers may facilitate the transport of virus-laden droplets of wastewater causing infection. Clinical and epidemiological studies are needed to present robust evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is transmissible via aerosols, though quantification of virus-laden aerosols at low concentrations presents a challenge. Wastewater surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 can be an effective tool in early detection of outbreak and determination of COVID-19 prevalence within a population, complementing clinical testing and providing decision makers guidance on restricting or relaxing movement. While poor air quality increases susceptibility to diseases, evidence for air pollution impact on COVID-19 infectivity is not available as infections are dynamically changing worldwide. Solid waste generated by households with infected individuals during the lockdown period may facilitate the spread of COVID-19 via fomite transmission route but has received little attention from the scientific community. Water bodies receiving raw sewage may pose risk of infection but this has not been investigated to date. Overall, our understanding of the environmental perspective of SARS-CoV-2 is imperative to detecting outbreak and predicting pandemic severity, allowing us to be equipped with the right tools to curb any future pandemic.","Al Huraimel, Khaled; Alhosani, Mohamed; Kunhabdulla, Shabana; Stietiya, Mohammed Hashem",Sci Total Environ,423,21

Dysregulated systemic inflammation and various patient traits are presumed to underlie this anomaly. Optimal VTE prophylaxis in COVID-19 patients has not been established due to a lack of validated models for predicting VTE in this population. Our study aims to address this deficiency by identifying demographic and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients associated with increased VTE risk. METHODS: This study is a retrospective analysis of all adult patients (final sample, n = 355) hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 at Einstein Medical Center Philadelphia between March 1 and April 24, 2020. Demographic and clinical patient data were collected and factors associated with VTE were identified and analyzed using t-tests, multivariable logistic regression, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: Thirty patients (8.5%) developed VTE. Patients with VTE had significantly higher D-dimer levels on admission (P = 0.045) and peak D-dimer levels (P < 0.0001), in addition to higher rates of vasopressor requirements (P = 0.038), intubation (P = 0.003), and death (P = 0.023). Age (OR 1.042), obstructive sleep apnea (OR 5.107), and need for intubation (OR 3.796) were associated with significantly increased odds of VTE. Peak D-dimer level was a good predictor of VTE (AUC 0.806, P < 0.0001) and a D-dimer cutoff of >6640 ng/mL had high (>70%) sensitivity and specificity for VTE. CONCLUSION: Peak D-dimer level may be the most reliable clinical marker in COVID-19 patients for predicting VTE and future prospective studies should attempt to further validate this.","Barnes, Drew H; Lo, Kevin Bryan; Bhargav, Ruchika; Gul, Fahad; DeJoy, Robert; Peterson, Eric; Salacup, Grace; Pelayo, Jerald; Albano, Jeri; Azmaiparashvili, Zurab; Rangaswami, Janani; Carpio, Andres Mora; Patarroyo-Aponte, Gabriel",The clinical respiratory journal (Online),423,16

A soluble form of EPCR (sEPCR) circulates in plasma and inhibits activated protein C (APC) activities. The clinical impact of sEPCR and its involvement in COVID-19 has not been explored. In this study, we investigated whether sEPCR levels were related to COVID-19 patients' requirement for hospitalization. METHODS: Plasma sEPCR levels were measured on hospital admission in 84 COVID-19 patients, and in eleven (11) non-hospitalized SARS-CoV2-positive patients approximately 6âdays after reported manifestation of their symptoms. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to identify potential risk factors for hospitalization and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to assess their value. RESULTS: In our cohort, hospitalized patients had considerably higher sEPCR levels upon admission compared to outpatients [107.5 (76.7-156.3) vs. 44.6 (12.1-84.4) ng/ml; pâ<â0.0001)].

SARS-CoV-2 emerging from Wuhan, China, took only three months to cover >200 countries worldwide by infecting more than 2.4 million people and killing more than 150,000 people. Although this infection at the early stage creates seasonal flu-like symptoms with a higher illness, it eventually causes a higher mortality. Epidemiological studies not only find the causes of many health issues but also suggest preventive measures. This study aimed to see the link between environment temperature and COVID-19 cases. STUDY DESIGN: The monthly average environment temperature (MAET) and various COVID-19 cases of a country were collected and analyzed to see the relationship between these parameters. METHODS: Univariate analysis and statistical modeling were used to determine the relationship between environment temperature and different COVID-19 cases. RESULTS: This study found that the majorities of the countries having higher COVID-19 cases are located in the higher latitude (colder region) in the globe. As of 20th April data available, statistical analyses by various methods have found that strong negative correlations with statistical significance exist between MAET and several COVID-19 cases including total cases, active cases, and cases per million of a country (Spearman correlation coefficients were -0.45, -0.42, and -0.50 for total cases, active cases, and cases/per million, respectively). Analysis by the statistical log-linear regression model further supports that the chance of patients to contract COVID-19 is less in warmer countries than in colder countries. CONCLUSION: This pilot study proposes that cold environment may be an additional risk factor for COVID-19 cases.","Mandal, Chandi C; Panwar, M S",Public Health,423,12

Little information has been reported about the clinical characteristics of the patients. METHODS: This single-center, retrospective, observational study was conducted in Yokohama, Japan. We included symptomatic patients who were infected on the ship and admitted to our hospital between 5 and 19 February 2020. All the cases were confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: We confirmed 17 cases. The average age was 69 years; 10 patients were Asian and 7 were Caucasian. Eleven patients had one or more chronic diseases. The major symptoms were cough and fever. Chest computed tomography (CT) scans found bilateral ground-glass opacities predominantly in the peripheral area, which were similar to reports from cases in China. C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were higher in severe and critical cases than in mild to moderate cases. The moderate to severe cases reached symptomatic resolution; one of the three critical cases resulted in death due to multiple organ failure. SARS-CoV-2 was detected by PCR at an average of 7 days after symptomatic resolution. CONCLUSIONS: Cough and fever, increased blood CRP levels, and CT findings of bilateral ground-glass opacities predominantly in the peripheral lung were characteristic of the COVID-19 cases in this study. These findings were compatible with those of previous reports.","Yoshimura, Yukihiro; Sasaki, Hiroaki; Horiuchi, Hiroshi; Miyata, Nobuyuki; Tachikawa, Natsuo",J Infect Chemother,423,33

To date, there has been limited empirical investigation about thoughts of suicide and self-harm during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A national survey was conducted May 2020 to investigate the association between mental health symptoms, social isolation, and financial stressors during the COVID-19 pandemic and thoughts of suicide and self-harm. A total of 6607 US adults completed an online survey; survey criteria included an age minimum of 22 years old and reported annual gross income of $75,000 or below. Statistical raking procedures were conducted to more precisely weight the sample using US Census data on age, geographic region, sex, race, and ethnicity. RESULTS: COVID-19-related stress symptoms, loneliness, and financial strain were associated with thoughts of suicide/self-harm in multivariable logistic regression analyses, as were younger age, being a military veteran, past homelessness, lifetime severe mental illness, current depressive symptoms, alcohol misuse, and having tested positive for COVID-19. Greater social support was inversely related to thoughts of suicide/self-harm whereas running out of money for basic needs (e.g., food), housing instability (e.g., delaying rent), and filing for unemployment or disability were positively related. CONCLUSIONS: Public health interventions to decrease risk of suicide and self-harm in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic should address pandemic-related stress, social isolation, and financial strain experienced including food insecurity, job loss, and risk of eviction/homelessness.","Elbogen, Eric B; Lanier, Megan; Blakey, Shannon M; Wagner, H Ryan; Tsai, Jack",Depress. anxiety,423,33

METHODS: Paraffin-embedded sections of the temporal cortex, motor cortex, caudate nucleus, globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus, substantia nigra, red nucleus, and midbrain tectum from 1020 PSP and 199 CBD cases were assessed by phospho-tau immunohistochemistry. The severity of tau lesions (i.e., neurofibrillary tangle, coiled body, tufted astrocyte or astrocytic plaque, and tau threads) was semi-quantitatively scored in each region. Hierarchical cluster analysis was performed using tau pathology scores. A decision tree classifier was made by tau pathology scores using 914 cases. Cross-validation was done using 305 cases. An additional ten cases were used for a validation study. RESULTS: Cluster analysis displayed two distinct clusters; the first cluster included only CBD, and the other cluster included all PSP and six CBD cases. We built a decision tree, which used only seven decision nodes. The scores of tau threads in the caudate nucleus were the most decisive factor for predicting CBD. In a cross-validation, 302 out of 305 cases were correctly diagnosed. In the pilot validation study, three investigators made a correct diagnosis in all cases using the decision tree. CONCLUSION: Regardless of the morphology of astrocytic tau lesions, semi-quantitative tau pathology scores in select brain regions are sufficient to distinguish PSP and CBD. The decision tree simplifies neuropathologic differential diagnosis of PSP and CBD.","Koga, Shunsuke; Zhou, Xiaolai; Dickson, Dennis W",Neuropathol. appl. neurobiol,423,24

Materials and methods: Forty-eight patients with abnormal papillary frenum were enrolled in the study. Patients were randomly assigned into three groups; conventional frenectomy operation (C group), diode laser-assisted frenectomy (L group), and diode laser-assisted frenectomy with conventional horizontal incision on the periosteum (L + P group). Post-operative pain, discomfort in speaking, and chewing scores were assessed with visual analogue scale (VAS) at post-operative 3rd hour and on days 1, 7, 14, 21, and 45. Epithelialization process of the wound surface was evaluated by hydrogen peroxide solution applied to the wound on days 7, 14, 21, and 45 following operations. The distance between the frenum attachment point and mucogingival junction (FMGJ) was recorded at baseline, post-operative 45th day, and 6th month to assess the reattachment of the frenum. Plaque index, gingival index, bleeding on probing, and probing depth were recorded at baseline and post-operative 7th, 14th, 21st, and 45th days. Results: On the 1st and 7th day after operation, VAS pain score in the C group was significantly higher than in the L and L + P groups (p < 0.017). Difficulty in speaking and chewing scores were significantly lower in the L and L + P groups compared to the C group at post-operative 3rd hour and 7th day (p < 0.017). The FMGJ and epithelization period demonstrated no difference among the groups at any time point (p > 0.05). Conclusions: Our results suggest that diode laser provides better post-operative patient's perceptions than the conventional technique in frenectomy operation. In addition, both conventional and laser-assisted frenectomy surgeries prevent the frenum reattachment regardless of periosteal horizontal incision.","Sezgin, Gamze; Ozturk Ozener, Hafize; Meseli, Suleyman Emre; Kuru, Leyla",Photobiomodul Photomed Laser Surg,423,1

Coagulopathy is a known complication of COVID-19 leading to thrombotic events including pulmonary embolism. It is unclear if the coagulopathy also increases thrombotic circuit complications of the ECMO. Aim of the present study therefor was to investigate the rate of V-V ECMO complications in COVID-19. We conducted a retrospective registry study including all patients on V-V ECMO treated at our centre between 01/2018 and 04/2020. COVID-19 cases were compared non- COVID-19 cases. All circuit related complications resulting in partial or complete exchange of the extracorporeal system were registered. In total, 66 patients were analysed of which 11 (16.7%) were SARS-CoV-2 positive. The two groups did not differ in clinical parameters including age (COVID-19 59.4 vs. non-COVID-19 58.1 years), gender (36.4% vs. 40%), BMI (27.8 vs. 24.2) and severity of illness as quantified by the RESP Score (1pt. vs 1pt.). 28 days survival was similar in both groups (72.7% vs. 58.2%). While anticoagulation was similar in both groups (p = 0.09), centrifugal pump head thrombosis was more frequent in COVID-19 (9/11 versus 16/55 p < 0.01). Neither the time to first exchange (p = 0.61) nor blood flow at exchange (p = 0.68) did differ in both groups. D-dimer levels prior to the thrombotic events were significantly higher in COVID-19 (mean 15.48 vs 26.59, p = 0.01).

Many of them have acquired SARS-CoV-2 and some have died. In Africa, where the pandemic is escalating, there are major gaps in response capacity, especially in human resources and protective equipment. We examine these challenges and propose interventions to protect healthcare workers on the continent, drawing on articles identified on Medline (Pubmed) in a search on 24 March 2020. Global jostling means that supplies of personal protective equipment are limited in Africa. Even low-cost interventions such as facemasks for patients with a cough and water supplies for handwashing may be challenging, as is 'physical distancing' in overcrowded primary health care clinics. Without adequate protection, COVID-19 mortality may be high among healthcare workers and their family in Africa given limited critical care beds and difficulties in transporting ill healthcare workers from rural to urban care centres. Much can be done to protect healthcare workers, however. The continent has learnt invaluable lessons from Ebola and HIV control. HIV counselors and community healthcare workers are key resources, and could promote social distancing and related interventions, dispel myths, support healthcare workers, perform symptom screening and trace contacts. Staff motivation and retention may be enhanced through carefully managed risk 'allowances' or compensation. International support with personnel and protective equipment, especially from China, could turn the pandemic's trajectory in Africa around. Telemedicine holds promise as it rationalises human resources and reduces patient contact and thus infection risks. Importantly, healthcare workers, using their authoritative voice, can promote effective COVID-19 policies and prioritization of their safety. Prioritizing healthcare workers for SARS-CoV-2 testing, hospital beds and targeted research, as well as ensuring that public figures and the population acknowledge the commitment of healthcare workers may help to maintain morale. Clearly there are multiple ways that international support and national commitment could help safeguard healthcare workers in Africa, essential for limiting the pandemic's potentially devastating heath, socio-economic and security impacts on the continent.","Chersich, Matthew F; Gray, Glenda; Fairlie, Lee; Eichbaum, Quentin; Mayhew, Susannah; Allwood, Brian; English, Rene; Scorgie, Fiona; Luchters, Stanley; Simpson, Greg; Haghighi, Marjan Mosalman; Pham, Minh Duc; Rees, Helen",Global Health,423,1
237540,237540,237540,On Migrants and Covid-19 Pandemic – an Analysis,18.185135,3.506345,2020,"Purpose: Healthcare governance places medical ethics at the forefront of defining and maintaining the quality of care. Examples of serious ethical issues include sexual abuse of patients (Dubois, Walsh, Chibnall et al., 2017), criminal prescription of opioids (Johnson, 2019) and unnecessary surgical procedures (Tayade and Dalvi, 2016) or shortages in service delivery because of little knowledge or experience especially during pandemic outbreaks (Hay-David et al., 2020). In many cases involving medical ethics, patients are identified as the first victims; however, this study aimed to consider clinicians and other healthcare practitioners as other probable victims (Ozeke et al., 2019). Design/methodology/approach: The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that tens of millions of patients worldwide suffer disabling injuries or death every year due to unsafe medical practices and services. Nearly, one in ten patients is harmed due to preventable causes while receiving health care in well-funded and technologically advanced hospital settings (WHO, 2016). Much less is known about the burden of unsafe care in non-hospital settings, where most healthcare services are delivered (Jha et al., 2013). Furthermore, there is little evidence concerning the burden of unsafe care in developing countries, where the risk of harm to patients is likely to be greater, due to limitations in infrastructure, technologies and human resources (Elmontsri et al., 2018). Findings: While these problems are endemic in health care, they are exacerbated in times of health and social crises such as the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This pandemic has few precedents, being most closely paralleled with the global influenza pandemic of 1918 (Terry, 2020). Initially compared to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2002–2003 (Parrym, 2003), COVID-19 is already proving much more deadly. The WHO’s estimates of the number of SARS cases from the start of the outbreak in 2002, until it was brought under control in July 2003, was 8,437 cumulative cases, with 813 deaths (WHO, 2003). The European Center for disease prevention and Control estimated that as of May 15, 2020, that 4,405,680 cases of COVID-19 have been reported with 302,115 deaths (ECDC, 2020) Research limitations/implications: The outbreak of COVID-19 was declared in February 2020 in the Islamic Republic of Iran, and up to March 2020, the cases of morbidity reached 12,729, with 611 deaths (Bedasht, 2020). The current figure at the time of editing (May 16, 2020) is 118,392 cases, with 6,937 deaths (Worldometer, 2020). Acting in cognizance of its ethical responsibility to the citizens of Iran, the Iranian government has taken the following action to attempt to mitigate the deleterious effects of the virus: in each province, one or more hospitals have been evacuated and allocated to patients with pulmonary problems with suspected to COVID-19. Access to intensive care units and specialist equipment is a primary ethical issue that concerns the Iranian healthcare system. The issue is exacerbated by the knowledge that these facilities are not distributed equitably in the country. Therefore, equity is the first ethical concern in this situation. Practical implications: All nurses, clinicians, practitioners and specialists have been asked to volunteer their services in hospitals in the most infected areas. This raises ethical concerns about access to personal protective equipment (PPE) such as appropriate masks, gowns, gloves and other equipment to protect healthcare workers from infection. Access to PPE was restricted because of government failure to stockpile the necessary amount of disposable medical equipment. This was related to lack of domestic capacity to produce the equipment and problems accessing it internationally due to political-economic sanctions that were imposed on Iran by the USA and some European countries. Such shortages can quickly lead to a catastrophic situation; current evidence demonstrates that about 40% of healthcare workers are vulnerable to the COVID-19 infection (Behdasht, 2020). However, it should be noted that this is not a problem limited to Iran. As of March 2020, the WHO was already warning about PPE shortages and the dangers this posed for healthcare workers around the world (WHO, 2020). Social implications: A Disaster Committee was created by the Iranian Ministry of Health to take responsibility for decision-making and daily information sharing to the community. The ethical dilemma that arises in terms of reporting the situation is the conflict between transparently presenting accurate and timely information and the creation of public panic and fear that this may cause in the community. Originality/value: As a steward for public health, the Ministry of Health was afforded direct responsibility to maintain intra-sector relationships and leadership with other organizations such as political executive organizations, municipalities, military agencies, schools, universities and other public organizations to reach consensus on the best methods of controlling the COVID-19 outbreak. An important ethical issue is found in potential areas of conflict between the therapeutic and preventive roles of the Ministry of Health and those related to public health and the civil administrations.","Bastani, Peivand; Sheykhotayefeh, Mostafa; Tahernezhad, Ali; Hakimzadeh, Seyyed Mostafa; Rikhtegaran, Samaneh",Int.

METHODS: This is an observational study using information from 2 online registries. The numbers of infected individuals and deaths and the prosperity rank of each country were obtained from worldometer.info and the Legatum Institute's Prosperity Index, respectively. RESULTS: There is a combination of countries with high and low prosperity on the list of COVID-19-infected countries. The risk of the virus pandemic seems to be more extensive in countries with high prosperity. A Spearman's rho test confirmed a significant correlation between prosperity, the number of COVID-19 cases, and the number of deaths at the 99% level. CONCLUSION: New emerging pandemics affect all nations. In order to increase the likelihood of successfully managing future events, it is important to consider preexisting health security, valid population-based management approaches, medical decision-making, communication, continuous assessment, triage, treatment, early and complete physical distancing strategies, and logistics.

This article reviews recent literature and offers opinions on filter practices. IVC filtration is most likely to benefit patients at high risk of iatrogenic pulmonary embolus during endovenous intervention. Filters should be used selectively in patients with acute trauma or undergoing bariatric surgery. Retrieval should be attempted for perforating filter and fractured filter fragments when imaging suggests feasibility and favorable risk-to-benefit ratio. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be considered when removing filters with confirmed gastrointestinal penetration. Anticoagulation solely because of filter presence is not recommended except in patients with active malignancy. Anticoagulation while filters remain in place may decrease long-term filter complications in these patients. Patients with a filter and symptomatic IVC occlusion should be offered filter removal and IVC reconstruction. Physicians implanting filters may maximize retrieval by maintaining physician-patient relationships and scheduling follow-up at time of placement. Annual follow-up allows continued evaluation for removal or replacement appropriateness. Advanced retrieval techniques increase retrieval rates but require caution. Select cases may require referral to experienced centers with additional retrieval resources.

India is now the second most-affected nation with more than 48,000,000 cases and 79,000 deaths. Despite this, and the fact that it is a lower-middle-income nation, the number of deaths is almost one third that of the United States and one half that of Brazil. However, there has been no experience published from non-COVID-19-designated hospitals, where the aim is to manage noninfected cases with neurosurgical ailments while keeping the number of infected cases to a minimum. METHODS: We analyzed the number of neurosurgical cases (nontrauma) done in the past 5 months (March-July 2020) in our institute, which is the largest neurosurgical center by volume in southern India, and compared the same to the concurrent 5 months in 2019 and 5 months preceding the pandemic. We also reviewed the total number of cases infected with COVID-19 managed during this time. RESULTS: We operated a total of 630 cases (nontrauma) in these 5 months and had 9 COVID-19 infected cases operated during this time. There was a 57% (P = 0.002) reduction in the number of cases operated as compared with the same 5 months in the preceding year. We employed a dual strategy of rapid antigen testing and surgery for cases needing emergency intervention and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction test for elective cases. The hospital was divided into 3 zones (red, orange, and green) depending on infectivity level with minimal interaction. Separate teams were designated for each zone, and thus we were able to effectively manage even infected cases despite the absence of pulmonology/medical specialists. CONCLUSIONS: We present a patient management protocol for non-COVID-19-designated hospitals in high-volume centers with the constraints of a lower-middle-income nation and demonstrate its effectiveness. Strict zoning targeted testing and effective triage can help in management during the pandemic.","Deora, Harsh; Dange, Preetham; Patel, Kautilya; Shashidhar, Abhinith; Tyagi, Gaurav; Pruthi, Nupur; Arivazhagan, Arimappamagan; Shukla, Dhaval; Dwarakanath, Srinivas",World neurosurgery (Online),423,3

Results show that Twitter is first and foremost used as a news seeking and sharing platform with more than 70 % of the most diffused tweets being related to news and comments on crisis updates. As for the retweeting dynamics, our results show an almost immediate response from Twitter users, with some first retweets occurring as quickly as within 2 s and the vast majority ( 90 % ) of them done within 10 min. Nearly 86 % of the retweeting processes could have 75 % of their retweets finished within 24 h, indicating a 1-day information value of tweets.

Results of retweeting community analysis show that following retweeters contribute to nearly 50 % of the retweets. In addition, the retweeting contribution of verified Twitter users is significantly ( P < 0.05 ) different from that of unverified users. A similar significant ( P < 0.05 ) difference is also found in their rates of verified retweeters, and it has been shown that verified Twitter users enjoy seven times as high value as that of unverified users.

Understanding the droplets’ behavior can be critical information to avoid disease transmission, especially while designing a device deals with human air respiratory. Although various studies have provided enormous computational fluid simulations, most cases are too specific and quite challenging to combine with other similar studies directly. Therefore, this paper proposes a systematic approach to predict the droplet behavior for coughing cases using machine learning. The approach consists of three models, which are droplet generator, mask model, and free droplet model modeled using feedforward neural network (FFNN). The evaluation has shown that the three FFNNs models’ accuracies are relatively high, with R-values of more than 0.990. The model has successfully predicted the evaporation effect on the diameter reduction and the completely evaporated state, which can be considered unlearned cases for machine learning models. The predicted horizontal distance pattern also agrees with the data in the literature. In summary, the proposed approach has demonstrated the capability to predict the diameter pattern according to the experimental or previous work data at various mask face types. © 2021 by the authors.

Students, especially medical sciences students, suffer from more stress as a result of exposure to COVID-induced stressors. It is, therefore, essential to measure mental health and its relationship with social support in medical sciences students during the COVID pandemic. The present study was conducted to determine the mental health status of students and its correlation with social support. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted using random sampling on 280 students of Tabriz University of Medical Sciences in Iran in 2020. Socio-demographic profile scale, Mental Health Test (GHQ-28), and the scale of Perceived Social Support (PRQ-85) were used to collect data. Participants completed the questionnaires online. RESULTS: Considering the potential confounding variables, a general linear model (GLM) was utilized to determine the relationship between mental health and perceived social support. Mean (± standard deviation) of total mental health score 26.5 (12.5) was in the acceptable range of 0-63., and 56% of students suffered from a mental disorder. Mean (± standard deviation) of social support score 128.2 (21.0) ranged from 25 to175. According to Pearson's correlation coefficient, there was a significant inverse correlation between social support score and total mental health score and all its subscales [p < 0.001; r = - 0.294 to - 0.536]. According to the GLM, mental health score decreased significantly with social support score [p = 0.0001; - 0.32 to - 0.20; CI 95%; B = 0.26]. CONCLUSIONS: Given the inverse relationship between social support and mental health, it is suggested to increase the level of social support for students at all times, especially during the stressful COVID-19 pandemic to improve their mental health.","Ghafari, Reza; Mirghafourvand, Mojgan; Rouhi, Mahsa; Osouli Tabrizi, Shirin",BMC Psychol,423,29

(preprint),17.910627,3.2684286,2021,"INTRODUCTION: In people living with HIV (PLWH), immune activation and inflammation levels are high even when viral suppression is maintained, potentially contributing to several comorbidities, and hampering the immune response to infections such as the recent SARS-CoV-2 disease 2019 (COVID-19). AREAS COVERED: Immune activation and inflammation play a role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Severe COVID-19 patients may experience cytokine release syndrome (CRS), leading to alveolar damage, pulmonary fibrinolysis, dysregulated coagulation, and pulmonary injury. Into the systemic circulation, cytokines in excess might leak out of pulmonary circulation, causing systemic symptoms and possibly a multiple-organ dysfunction syndrome. Preexisting comorbidities are also linked to worse COVID-19 outcome: studies suggest that diabetes and hypertension are linked to higher mortality rates. Such comorbidities are more frequent in PLWH, but it is unclear if they have worse outcomes in the case of COVID-19. The literature was searched in PubMed/MEDLINE and EMBASE, and manually in COVID-19 resources. EXPERT OPINION: A body of evidence shows that HIV and SARS-CoV-2 are able to activate inflammatory pathways, acute in the case of SARS-CoV-2, chronic in the case of HIV, while the comorbidities seem to represent, in the first case, a contributory cause, in the second an effect of the virus-induced damage.","Maggi, Paolo; Ricci, Elena; Messina, Vincenzo; Salzillo, Angela; Simeone, Filomena; Iodice, Angelo; Socio, Giuseppe Vittorio",Expert Rev Clin Immunol,423,30

METHODS: Seventy-two patients were selected according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, with the upper central incisors having color A2 or darker according to the Vita Classical scale (VITA Zahnfabrik, Bad Säckingen, Germany) and randomized into two groups: 10% hydrogen peroxide applied once daily for 15 minutes (HP 15) or applied once daily for 30 minutes (HP 30). Bleaching was performed for 14 days in both groups. The color was evaluated before bleaching, during bleaching (1st and 2nd weeks), and 1 month after the bleaching treatment using the Vita Classical, Vita Bleachedguide 3D-MASTER, and Vita Easyshade spectrophotometer (VITA Zahnfabrik). Dental sensitivity was recorded by the patients using the numerical rating scale (0-4) and visual analogue scale (0-10 cm). Color data were evaluated by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) of repeated measures (group vs. treatment time). The Mann-Whitney test was performed to contrast the means (&#945;=0.05). Tooth sensitivity was assessed by Fisher's exact test (p=1.00) and intensity of tooth sensitivity was evaluated by the Mann-Whitney test (&#945;=0.05) for both scales. RESULTS: A significant whitening effect was observed after 2 weeks of bleaching for all color measurements (p=0.01), with no difference between HP 15 and HP 30 (p>0.05). Also, the absolute risk and intensity of tooth sensitivity were similar (47%; p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness and tooth sensitivity of at-home bleaching carried out with 10% hydrogen peroxide applied for 15 minutes or 30 minutes are similar.","Chemin, K; Rezende, M; Costa, M C; Salgado, Ady; de Geus, J L; Loguercio, A D; Reis, A; Kossatz, S",Oper.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: During an eight-week lockdown, Emergency Dental Centers (EDCs) were established and coordinated on the national level to treat patients' urgent dental conditions. Telemedicine was used on the first level of triage to reduce contacts between healthcare workers and patients. Weekly coordination between EDCs was supported by real-time data acquisition on the number of patient visits, prescribed medicine, the number and type of dental procedures, and the usage of personal protective equipment (PPE). RESULTS: In EDCs, 27,468 patients were serviced, on average 235 patients per day/million people. The care was provided by 4798 man days of dental health care workers. Except for the first week, treatment and triage visits showed a slight increase. The number of incisions was nearly constant, while the number of extractions increased. A nearly threefold increase was found for emergency endodontic treatments (EET). The number of antibiotic prescriptions demonstrated an increasing trend. Analgesic prescriptions showed a decreasing trend from the beginning of lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: The reorganization and centralization of dental care proved to be an efficient model in Slovenia for the provision of urgent dental care, and the management of the healthcare workforce and PPE. Data from this study may provide helpful information for planning the needs and corresponding resources for the next waves of epidemics of COVID-19.","Ostrc, Tadej; Pavlovic, Krunoslav; Fidler, Ales",,423,10

Cortical effects of VNS, manifesting as vagal-evoked potentials (VEPs), are thought to arise from activation of ascending cholinergic and noradrenergic systems. However, it is unknown whether those effects are modulated by brain state at the time of stimulation. In 2 freely behaving macaque monkeys, we delivered short trains of 5 pulses to the left cervical vagus nerve at different frequencies (5-300 Hz) while recording local field potentials (LFPs) from sites in contralateral prefrontal, sensorimotor and parietal cortical areas. Brain states were inferred from spectral components of LFPs and the presence of overt movement: active awake, resting awake, REM sleep and NREM sleep. VNS elicited VEPs in all sampled cortical areas. VEPs comprised early (<70 ms), intermediate (70-250 ms) and late (>250 ms) components. The magnitude of the intermediate and late components was largest during NREM sleep and smallest during wakefulness, whereas that of the early component was not modulated by brain state. VEPs during NREM were larger for stimuli delivered at the depolarized phase of ongoing delta oscillations. Higher pulsing frequencies generated larger VEPs. These short VNS trains did not affect brain state transitions during wakefulness or sleep. Our findings suggest that ongoing brain state modulates the evoked effects of VNS on cortical activity. This has implications for the role of ongoing cortical activity and brain state in shaping cortical responses to peripheral stimuli, for the modulation of vagal interoceptive signaling by cortical activity, and for the dose calibration of VNS therapies.","Rembado, Irene; Song, Weiguo; Su, David K; Levari, Ariel; Shupe, Larry E; Perlmutter, Steve; Fetz, Eberhard; Zanos, Stavros",Cereb. cortex,423,24

The present study investigated spatial patterns of richness, composition, and abundance of native (non-migratory and migratory) and non-native fishes in the cascade of reservoirs along the Paranapanema River. The study is based on data collected from 34 independent studies conducted in nine reservoirs (47 samples). The compilation recorded 161 species, being 111 native (14 migratory) and 50 non-native. Total richness ranged between 56 and 112 species/reservoir, with a mean of 72 (49.9 non-migratory, 8.1 migratory and 14 non-native). The number of non-migratory species showed no spatial trend along the cascade system, but migratory and non-native richness increased toward downstream reaches. We also observed spatial variation in species composition along the cascade system, but some non-native fishes were widely distributed. Migratory fishes showed low relative abundance (usually < 10%), while non-native species were common and more abundant, especially in reservoirs downstream. Our results revealed a high diversity of fishes in the cascade of impoundments, but indicated that migratory fishes are rare, while non-native species are common or dominant.(AU)","Pelicice, Fernando Mayer; Azevedo-Santos, Valter M; Esguícero, André Luiz Henríques; Agostinho, Angelo Antonio; Arcifa, Marlene Sofia",Neotrop. ichthyol,423,24

Various pathogens, antibodies and immune complexes, cytokines, microcrystals, and other physiological stimuli can cause NETosis. Induction of NETosis depends on reactive oxygen species (ROS), the main source of which is NADPH oxidase. Activation of NADPH oxidase depends on increase in the concentration of Ca2+ in the cytoplasm and in some cases on the generation of ROS in mitochondria. NETosis includes release of the granule components into the cytosol, modification of histones leading to chromatin decondensation, destruction of the nuclear envelope, as well as formation of pores in the plasma membrane. In this review, basic mechanisms of NETosis, as well as its role in the pathogenesis of some diseases including COVID-19 are discussed.","Vorobjeva, N V; Chernyak, B V",Biochemistry (Mosc),423,16

It is caused by a SARS-CoV-2 belonging to a family known as corona virus. The aim of this study is to assess the community knowledge, attitude and practice strategy implementation on SARS-CoV-2 disease 2019 (COVID-19). A cross-sectional survey study was done from July to October, 2020 in Woldia town, Northeast Ethiopia. Interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect data from 404 respondents. Data collected were analyzed using descriptive statistics and chi-square test with a 95% confidence interval to know the association of socio-demographic characteristics with the knowledge, attitude and practices towards COVID-19. From a total of 404 responses collected (64.1%, n = 259/404), (50.7%, n = 205/404) and (39.6%, n = 160/404) of the respondents were between ages 18-39 years, males and were diploma and above, respectively. The majority of the respondents had good knowledge about the transmission mode and symptoms of COVID-19 and they obtained information mainly through mass media. The knowledge of the respondents about the transmission mode of COVID-I9 through coughing and sneezing, direct contact with infected person and touching contaminated materials was statistically associated with education and occupation (p <0.001). Among the total respondents (53.7%, n = 217/404) had a negative attitude that COVID-19 pandemic will not be controlled. The attitude of the respondents towards successfully controlling of COVID-I9 was statistically associated in terms of age, marital status, education and occupation (p < 0.001). Most of the respondents (63.1%, n = 255/404), (58.9%, n = 238/404), (66.8%, n = 270/404) and (63.9%, n = 258/404) did not wash hands with soap, avoidance of touching the nose and mouth, practicing social distancing and wearing of face masks in public or crowded places, respectively. The practices of the respondents towards COVID-19 were statistically associated with sex, marital status, education and occupation (p < 0.01). COVID-19 is currently the cause of death and it has a great impact on the economy, politics and social interactions in the study area. The government should strength the health system by increasing surveillance activities in detecting cases. Our findings suggest that the community should practice the WHO and EMoH recommendations to minimize the spread of the virus.","Molla, Kindu Alem; Abegaz, Silamlak Birhanu",PLoS One,423,16

This study aimed to evaluate the early and late results of MICS for MVRp vs conventional sternotomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials or observational studies (with matched populations) comparing MICS and conventional MVRp reporting any of the following outcomes: mortality, MVRp failure, complications, blood transfusion, readmission within 30 days after discharge, long-term reoperation for mitral regurgitation, operative times, mechanical ventilation time, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, or hospital stay. The pooled treatment effects were calculated using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Ten studies involving 6792 patients (MICS: 3396 patients; Conventional: 3296 patients) met the eligibility criteria. In the pooled analysis, MICS significantly reduced the risk for blood transfusion (odds ratio [OR], 0.654; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.462-0.928; P = .017) and readmission within 30 days after discharge (OR, 0.615; 95% 0.456-0.829; P = .001). MICS was associated with a significantly longer cross-clamp time (mean difference 14 minutes; 95% CI, 7.4-21 minutes; P < .001), CPB time (24 minutes; 95% CI, 14-35 minutes; P < .001), and total operative time (36; 95% CI, 15-56 minutes; P < .001), but a significantly shorter ICU stay (-8.5; 95% CI -15; -1.8; P = .013) and hospital stay (-1.3, 95% CI -2.1; -0.45; P = .003). This meta-analysis found no significant difference regarding the risk of in-hospital and long-term mortality, nor complications. CONCLUSIONS: Despite longer operative times, MICS for MVRp reduces ICU and hospital stay, as well as readmission rates and the need for transfusion.","Sá, Michel Pompeu B O; Van den Eynde, Jef; Cavalcanti, Luiz Rafael P; Kadyraliev, Bakytbek; Enginoev, Soslan; Zhigalov, Konstantin; Ruhparwar, Arjang; Weymann, Alexander; Dreyfus, Gilles",J. card. surg,423,20

Therefore, researches have been developed to identify new drug candidates for future treatments. Among them, antiviral research based on natural molecules is a promising approach. Phospholipases A2 (PLA2s) isolated from snake venom have shown significant antiviral activity against some viruses such as Dengue virus, Human Immunodeficiency virus, Hepatitis C virus and Yellow fever virus, and have emerged as an attractive alternative strategy for the development of novel antiviral therapy. Thus, this review provides an overview of remarkable findings involving PLA2s from snake venom that possess antiviral activity, and discusses the mechanisms of action mediated by PLA2s against different stages of virus replication cycle. Additionally, molecular docking simulations were performed by interacting between phospholipids from Dengue virus envelope and PLA2s from Bothrops asper snake venom. Studies on snake venom PLA2s highlight the potential use of these proteins for the development of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs.","Teixeira, S C; Borges, B C; Oliveira, V Q; Carregosa, L S; Bastos, L A; Santos, I A; Jardim, A C G; Melo, F F; Freitas, L M; Rodrigues, V M; Lopes, D S",Int J Biol Macromol,423,23

We report here a longitudinal single-cell and repertoire profiling of the B cell response up to 6 months in mild and severe COVID-19 patients. Distinct SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific activated B cell clones fueled an early antibody-secreting cell burst as well as a durable synchronous germinal center response. While highly mutated memory B cells, including pre-existing cross-reactive seasonal Betacoronavirus-specific clones, were recruited early in the response, neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific clones accumulated with time and largely contributed to the late, remarkably stable, memory B cell pool. Highlighting germinal center maturation, these cells displayed clear accumulation of somatic mutations in their variable region genes over time. Overall, these findings demonstrate that an antigen-driven activation persisted and matured up to 6 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection and may provide long-term protection.","Sokal, Aurélien; Chappert, Pascal; Barba-Spaeth, Giovanna; Roeser, Anais; Fourati, Slim; Azzaoui, Imane; Vandenberghe, Alexis; Fernandez, Ignacio; Meola, Annalisa; Bouvier-Alias, Magali; Crickx, Etienne; Beldi-Ferchiou, Asma; Hue, Sophie; Languille, Laetitia; Michel, Marc; Baloul, Samia; Noizat-Pirenne, France; Luka, Marine; Mégret, Jérôme; Ménager, Mickaël; Pawlotsky, Jean-Michel; Fillatreau, Simon; Rey, Felix A; Weill, Jean-Claude; Reynaud, Claude-Agnès; Mahévas, Matthieu",Cell,423,24

In addition, the measures that succeeded in containing the epidemic created a profound economic crisis, which real dimension is still unclear. It is clear, however, that most healthcare systems were unprepared. Years of cost containments had eroded the ability of the healthcare sector to cope with the surge in cases. This editorial contends that rebuilding the healthcare systems will require forward thinking, a data-driven approach and avoidance of reactive decision making. The editorial proposes the Value Based Medicine approach as a way to avoid the errors of the past and to align decision making in healthcare with patient health and quality of life (Value). This is an approach that is gaining traction in several systems. It needs a built-in capability to collect and analyse outcome and costing data. Today the necessary informatic and computational capabilities are widely available.","Strazzabosco, Mario",Liver Int,423,24

In this study, we aimed at assessing the impact social media has on the anxiety level of dental healthcare workers (DHCWs) whilst living through the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An online questionnaire was disseminated to a cross-sectional sample of DHCWs from 19 countries using social media platforms. The questionnaire enquired about DHCWs' frequency of using social media and their dependency on health-related information posted on those platforms. Anxiety was measured using General Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7). RESULTS: Four-hundred and three (403) DHCWs completed the online questionnaire. Sixty-eight percent (68%) frequently use social media for information on COVID-19. The frequency of social media use was higher among younger DHCWs, with shorter clinical experience, and holders of undergraduate qualifications (p = 0.009, p = 0.002, and p = 0.023, respectively). Almost one third of DHCWs had moderate to severe anxiety (31.7%), which was significantly associated with the frequency of social media use (p = 0.016). This association was adjusted for age, years of experience and qualification level (OR 1.75; 95% CI 1.05-2.93; p = 0.032). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 social media infodemic has been adversely impacting the psychological wellbeing of DHCWs. More effective measures are needed to control the quality and spreadability of health information on social media platforms.","Al-Amad, Suhail H; Hussein, Amal",BMC Psychol,423,7

For that purpose, an online questionnaire, based on 44 items including socio-demographic data, Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) Adherence Screener (MEDAS) as a reference of a healthy diet, processed foods intake, changes in their usual food choices and weight gain was distributed using social media and snowball sampling. A total of 7514 participants (37% aged below 35 years, 70.6% female, 77.9% university-level education or higher) from all the Spanish territory completed the questionnaire. Results outlined healthier dietary behaviours during the confinement when compared to previous habits. Overall, the MEDAS score (ranging from 0 to 14, whereby higher a scoring reflects greater adherence to the MedDiet) increased significantly from 6.53 ± 2 to 7.34 ± 1.93 during the confinement. Multivariate logistic regression models, adjusted for age, gender, region and other variables, showed a statistically significant higher likelihood of changing the adherence to the MedDiet (towards an increase in adherence) in those persons who decreased the intake of fried foods, snacks, fast foods, red meat, pastries or sweet beverages, but increased MedDiet-related foods such as olive oil, vegetables, fruits or legumes during the confinement. COVID-19 confinement in Spain has led to the adoption of healthier dietary habits/behaviours in the studied population, as reflected by a higher adherence to the MedDiet. This improvement, if sustained in the long-term, could have a positive impact on the prevention of chronic diseases and COVID-19-related complications.","Rodríguez-Pérez, Celia; Molina-Montes, Esther; Verardo, Vito; Artacho, Reyes; García-Villanova, Belén; Guerra-Hernández, Eduardo Jesús; Ruíz-López, María Dolores",Nutrients,423,16

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 84 consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 who underwent CTA for suspected PE. The presence and localization of PE as well as the type and extent of pulmonary opacities on chest CT exams were examined and correlated with the information on comorbidities and laboratory values for all patients. RESULTS: Of the 84 patients, pulmonary embolism was discovered in 24 patients. We observed that 87% of PE was found to be in lung parenchyma affected by COVID-19 pneumonia. Compared with no-PE patients, PE patients showed an overall greater lung involvement by consolidation (p = 0.02) and GGO (p < 0.01) and a higher level of D-Dimer (p < 0,01). Moreover, the PE group showed a lower level of saturation (p = 0,01) and required more hospitalization (p < 0,01). CONCLUSION: Our study showed a high incidence of PE in COVID-19 pneumonia. In 87% of patients, PE was found in lung parenchyma affected by COVID-19 pneumonia with a worse CT severity score and a greater number of lung lobar involvement compared with non-PE patients. CT severity, lower level of saturation, and a rise in D-dimer levels could be an indication for a CTPA.

DATA SOURCES: Review of recent literature from PubMed and relevant health and care reports. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused monumental disruption to health care delivery and care. Caregivers face unprecedented levels of uncertainty: both for the people they care for and for their own health and well-being. Given that many carers face poor health and well-being, there is a significant risk that health inequalities will be increased by this pandemic, particularly for high-risk groups. Innovations including those supported and delivered by digital health could make a significant difference but careful planning and implementation is a necessity for widespread implementation. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Carers need to be championed in the years ahead to ensure they do not become left at the ""back of the queue"" for health and well-being equity. This situation has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Disruptive change to health and social care is now required where digital health solutions hold considerable promise, yet to be fully realized.","Egan, Kieren",Semin Oncol Nurs,423,21

METHOD: An integrative text mining analysis in Medline was performed to identify studies on the mental health of older adults during the pandemic. Subsequently, statistical topic modeling was performed to identify the most prevalent terms and topics discussed in included studies. RESULTS: A total of 29 studies were retrieved until July 1st 2020, including a majority of letters (12 studies) and commentaries (8 studies). The most frequent terms overall were: loneliness (n = 137), support (n = 132), home (n = 102), suicide (n = 96) and help (n = 94). The most prevalent terms were then divided in five topics: home (33%), suicide (32%), apps (15%), loneliness (12%) and physical activity (9%). Additionally, a section focused on low- and middle-income countries was included. A summary of strategies to mitigate the effects of pandemic in mental health of older adults was also provided. CONCLUSION: These factors demonstrate the importance of developing strategies for psychosocial support that take into consideration the particularities of the elderly. Different levels of care are immediately necessary to diminish the devastating impact of the pandemic in the mental health of older adults.","Borelli, Wyllians Vendramini; Xavier, Laura de Lima; Ornell, Felipe; Schuch, Jaqueline Bohrer; Von Diemen, Lisia",Aging Ment Health,423,26

Although there is no clear gender or socioeconomic discrimination in the incidence of COVID-19, individuals who are older adults and/or with comorbidities and compromised immunity have a relatively higher risk of contracting this disease. Since no specific drug has yet been discovered, strengthening immunity along with maintaining a healthy living is the best way to survive this disease. As a healthy practice, calorie restriction in the form of intermittent fasting (IF) in several clinical settings has been reported to promote several health benefits, including priming of the immune response. This dietary restriction also activates autophagy, a cell surveillance system that boosts up immunity. With these prevailing significance in priming host defense, IF could be a potential strategy amid this outbreak to fighting off SARS-CoV-2 infection. Currently, no review so far available proposing IF as an encouraging strategy in the prevention of COVID-19. A comprehensive review has therefore been planned to highlight the beneficial role of fasting in immunity and autophagy, that underlie the possible defense against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The COVID-19 pathogenesis and its impact on host immune response have also been briefly outlined. This review aimed at revisiting the immunomodulatory potential of IF that may constitute a promising preventive approach against COVID-19.","Hannan, Md Abdul; Rahman, Md Ataur; Rahman, Md Saidur; Sohag, Abdullah Al Mamun; Dash, Raju; Hossain, Khandkar Shaharina; Farjana, Mithila; Uddin, Md Jamal",Immunol Lett,423,28

METHODS: In the largest survey on mental health of HCW conducted during the first wave of COVID-19 in Europe (N = 8071 HCW), we investigated depressive (Patient Health Questionnaire-2, PHQ-2), and anxiety symptoms (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2, GAD-2), working conditions, and psychosocial burden of 3678 HCW of three health care professions in hospitals: physicians (n = 1061), nurses (n = 1275), and medical technical assistants (MTA, n = 1342). RESULTS: The prevalence of clinically significant levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms was 17.4% and 17.8% for physicians, 21.6% and 19.0% for nurses, and 23.0% and 20.1% for MTA, respectively. All three professions demonstrated significantly elevated PHQ-2 and GAD-2 scores, when compared with general German population before the pandemic, but lower scores in relation to that during the pandemic. Multiple linear regression analyses revealed that higher levels of depressive symptoms were associated with insufficient recovery during leisure time, increased alcohol consumption, and less trust in colleagues in difficult situations at work. In addition, elevated anxiety scores were related to increased fear of becoming infected with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: During the pandemic HCW demonstrated a lower burden of mental distress compared to the general population. Nevertheless, a high percentage of HCW demonstrates psychosocial distress, so that the establishment of regular mental health screening and prevention programmes for HCW is indicated.","Morawa, Eva; Schug, Caterina; Geiser, Franziska; Beschoner, Petra; Jerg-Bretzke, Lucia; Albus, Christian; Weidner, Kerstin; Hiebel, Nina; Borho, Andrea; Erim, Yesim",J Psychosom Res,423,13

RESULTS: From the instigation of the NHSE contract with the Independent Sector up until 28th June 2020 The Norfolk and Norwich University NHS Trust (NNUH) delivered 9016 episodes of care including 576 surgical episodes at its nearby Independent Hospital. During the time that a seven day household isolation period was required, no patients from the 31 tested postoperatively were recorded as testing positive for Covid-19. In the month after moving to a mandatory 14 day period of household isolation, 29 patients had their surgery postponed as they were unable to comply with the required period of isolation. CONCLUSION: Working cooperatively with the independent sector can deliver significant additional capacity for the NHS. Fourteen days household isolation may impact on a patient's decision to have surgery, despite, in some cases, that surgery being time-sensitive. The recommendation from NICE reducing the length of isolation largely reversed this impact.","Barker, Thomas; Barker, Paul; Sokalsky, Louise; McNamara, Iain",Surg. (Edinb.),423,16

Indicators have been a vehicle for the government of states through the external imposition and internal self-application of standards and benchmarks. Securitisation refers to the calling-into-being of emergencies in the face of existential threats to the nation. This paper contextualises both historically with reference to the trajectory of Global South states in the decades after decolonisation, which saw the rise and decline of Third-World solidarity and its replacement by neoliberalism and global governance mechanisms in health, as in other sectors. The interaction between these modes and their relative prominence during COVID-19 is studied through a brief case-study of developments in Kenya during the early months of the pandemic.

Shutz in 1986 using only gravitational waves to infer the Hubble constant (H$_0$) from GW190814, the first first high-probability neutron-star--black-hole (NS-BH) merger candidate detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) and the Virgo interferometer. We apply a baseline test of this method to the binary neutron star (BNS) merger GW170817 and find H$_0 = 70^{+35.0}_{-18.0}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ (maximum a posteriori and 68.3% highest density posterior interval) for a galaxy $B$-band luminosity threshold of $L_B \geq 0.001 L_B^*$ with a correction for catalog incompleteness. Repeating the calculation for GW190814, we obtain H$_0 = 67^{+41.0}_{-26.0}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and H$_0 = 71^{+34.0}_{-30.0}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ for $L_B \geq 0.001 L_B^*$ and $L_B \geq 0.626 L_B^*$, respectively. Combining the posteriors for both events yields H$_0 = 70^{+29.0}_{-18.0}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, demonstrating the improvement on constraints when using multiple gravitational wave events. We also confirm the results of other works that adopt this method, showing that increasing the $L_B$ threshold enhances the posterior structure and slightly shifts the distribution's peak to higher H$_0$ values. We repeat the joint inference using the low-spin PhenomPNRT and combined (SEOBNRv4PHM + IMRPhenomPv3HM) posterior samples for GW170817 and GW190814, respectively, achieving a tighter constraint of H$_0 = 69^{+29.0}_{-14.0}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$.","Vasylyev, Sergiy; Filippenko, Alex",,423,1

A total of 437 participants provided demographical data and were assessed using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale, the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, and the Emotional Eating subscale of the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire. Correlational analyses were performed to assess the relationship between continuous variables, while ANOVA was conducted to detect differences between males and females for emotional eating. To assess whether demographic and clinical data predicted emotional eating, hierarchical linear regression was performed. Then, a mediation analysis was conducted to assess whether emotional dysregulation was a mediator between psychological distress and emotional eating. Emotional eating was associated with psychological distress and emotional dysregulation. Moreover, higher levels of emotional eating were found in females than in males. Predictors of emotional eating were sex, psychological distress, and emotional dysregulation. Mediation analyses showed that the indirect effect of psychological distress on emotional eating through emotional dysregulation was significant (b = 0.0069;SE = 0.0024;CI = 0.0024–0.0118), confirming that the relationship between psychological distress and emotional eating was mediated by emotional dysregulation, controlling for sex.

Patients on immunosuppressive therapy will be amongst the earliest to be vaccinated. Some evidence indicates immunosuppressive therapy inhibits humoral response to the influenza, pneumococcal and hepatitis B vaccines. The degree to which this will translate to impaired COVID-19 vaccine responses is unclear. Other evidence suggests withholding methotrexate for two weeks post vaccination may improve responses. Rituximab has been shown to impair humoral responses for 6 months or longer post administration. Decisions on withholding or interrupting immunosuppressive therapy around COVID-19 vaccination will need to be made prior to the availability of data on specific COVID-19 vaccine response in these patients. With this in mind, this article outlines the existing data on the effect of antirheumatic therapy on vaccine responses in patients with inflammatory arthritis and formulates a possible pragmatic management strategy for COVID-19 vaccination.","Arnold, Jack; Winthrop, Kevin; Emery, Paul",Rheumatology (Oxford),423,1

A Daily Diary Study of Creative Activity During Pandemics,18.097765,3.2185352,2021,"As of December 2019, a new strain of coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was discovered in Wuhan, China, following an epidemic of a fast-spreading viral respiratory disease, later called Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), which then lead to the present pandemic the world has come to know. Patients who tested positive for COVID-19 are mostly asymptomatic or present with mild self-limiting symptoms. While GI symptoms occur with less prevalence, they are increasingly being reported. A diagnosis of Covid-19 has increased dramatically in patients presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms suggesting that GI symptoms should be taken into serious consideration with patient diagnosis. Case 1: A 65-year-old man presented to the hospital emergency room with abdominal pain, Murphy's sign and chills without fever, subsequently diagnosed as acute acalculous cholecystitis with a positive COVID-19 rRT-PCR. Case 2: A 78-year-old woman presented to the hospital emergency room complaining of severe positional epigastric pain precipitated by lying supine, chills with no fever, being later diagnosed as acute pancreatitis and a positive COVID-19 rRT-PCR. It has become evident that the ACE2 receptor plays a significant role as the entry site into human cells for the virus. This receptor is generally expressed in respiratory cells, as well as the gastrointestinal tract, corresponding with extrapulmonary manifestations of COVID-19. Studies concluded that the origin of gastrointestinal symptoms could be caused by the interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with cells through the ACE2 receptor. The findings of the present study support this theory, as both patients presented with symptoms regarding tissues with high ACE2 expression.","Hassani, Amir Hossein; Beheshti, Alireza; Almasi, Faezeh; Ketabi Moghaddam, Pardis; Azizi, Mohammadreza; Shahrokh, Shabnam",Gastroenterol Hepatol Bed Bench,423,23

These students had to prepare for the continuity of their study mentally and physically by adapting to the online teaching and learning approach, which can significantly impact their academic performance. Hence, this study examines the students’ academic performance on the online teaching and learning approach, thus predicting their academic performance for the upcoming semester. This study enables various actions to be taken in improving and maintaining the student’s performance in their study activities. The study was conducted on undergraduate students from the Faculty of Science and Mathematics, Universiti Pendidikan Sultan Idris. This paper presents the prediction of the student’s academic performance with a linear regression model. Evidently, the result shows that the student’s academic performance continually improves while adapting to the online teaching and learning approach. It also shows that there were few respondents affected while adapting to this new norm approach. Hence, the future development of the regression model can be improved by having a more comprehensive range of Malaysian universities’ data. © 2021 North Atlantic University Union NAUN.

Unfortunately, there are no specific drugs available to cure this disease. Type 2 taste receptors (TAS2Rs) may play an important role in host defense mechanisms. Based on the idea of host-directed therapy (HDT), we performed a negative co-expression analysis using big data of 60 000 Affymetrix expression arrays and 5000 TCGA data sets to determine the functions of TAS2R10, which can be activated by numerous bitter substances. Excitingly, we found that the main functions of TAS2R10 involved controlling infectious diseases caused by bacteria, viruses, and parasites, suggesting that TAS2R10 is a key trigger of host defense pathways. To quickly guide the clinical treatment of 2019-nCoV, we searched currently available drugs that are agonists of TAS2Rs. We identified many cheap, available, and safe medicines, such as diphenidol, quinine, chloroquine, artemisinin, chlorpheniramine, yohimbine, and dextromethorphan, which may target the most common symptoms caused by 2019-nCoV. We suggest that a cocktail-like recipe of existing bitter drugs may help doctors to fight this catastrophic disease and that the general public may drink or eat bitter substances, such as coffee, tea, or bitter vegetables, to reduce the risk of infection.","Li, Xiangqi; Zhang, Chaobao; Liu, Lianyong; Gu, Mingjun",FASEB J,423,1

Results: a total of 32 patients underwent elective oncologic (n = 17;53 %) and emergency (n = 15;47 %) operations. Screening by chest-CT revealed three cases of COVID-19 (9 %) having led to postpone two interventions. The third positive COVID-19 patient died of respiratory complications after bladder perforation urgent procedure. Two patients developed compatible post-operatively symptoms with one positive chest-CT but no positive RT-PCR and successful recovery.

The main purpose of this two-year follow-up case study was, therefore, to examine whether syllable complexity may be considered as a robust indicator in CAS and whether it can explain the persistence of errors and, if so, at what age. This was tested in a boy followed up annually from age 5 to 7 who was administered a narrative task. Data analyses used the Phon program to estimate accuracies of different syllabic structures, phones, singleton and cluster consonants. Overall, the findings suggest that this child experienced difficulty producing syllabic structure commensurately with the level of complexity of the target structures. Notably, the presence of syllable planning/sequencing deficit found in French data clearly supports the hypotheses according to which (a) there is a relationship between the level of complexity of syllabic structures and their simplification and (b) the persistence of errors on the most complex syllables remains, becoming a robust indicator for identifying CAS from other speech disorders. Further cross-language investigations on syllable complexity in CAS are needed to design better assessments and to plan efficient intervention.","Canault, Mélanie; Thai-van, Hung; Le Normand, Marie-Thérèse",Clin Linguist Phon,423,20

However, some challenges still exist, including the complexity and variability features of the opacity regions, the small difference between the infected and healthy tissues, and the noise of CT images. Due to limited medical resources, it is impractical to obtain a large amount of data in a short time, which further hinders the training of deep learning models. To answer these challenges, we proposed a novel spatial- and channel-wise coarse-to-fine attention network (SCOAT-Net), inspired by the biological vision mechanism, for the segmentation of COVID-19 lung opacification from CT images. With the UNet++ as basic structure, our SCOAT-Net introduces the specially designed spatial-wise and channel-wise attention modules, which serve to collaboratively boost the attention learning of the network and extract the efficient features of the infected opacification regions at the pixel and channel levels. Experiments show that our proposed SCOAT-Net achieves better results compared to several state-of-the-art image segmentation networks and has acceptable generalization ability.","Zhao, Shixuan; Li, Zhidan; Chen, Yang; Zhao, Wei; Xie, Xingzhi; Liu, Jun; Zhao, Di; Li, Yongjie",Pattern Recognit,423,16

Serological tests can be employed for RT-PCR negative patients, contact tracing, determining the probability of protection against re-infection, and seroepidemiological studies. AREAS COVERED: The main methodologies of serology-based tests for detection of SARS-CoV-2 including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), chemiluminescent immunoassays (CLIAs) and lateral flow immunoassays (LFIAs) were reviewed and their diagnostic performances were compared. Herein, a literature review on the databases of PubMed, Scopus and Google Scholar between January 01, 2020 and June 30, 2020 based on the main serological methods for COVID-19 detection with the focus on comparative experiments was performed. The review was updated on 31th December 2020. EXPERT OPINION: Serology testing could be considered as a part of diagnostic panel two weeks post symptom onset. Higher sensitivity for serology-based tests could be achieved by determining combined IgG/IgM titers. Furthermore, higher sensitive serological test detecting neutralization antibody could be developed by targeting spike (S) antigen. It was also demonstrated that the sensitivity of ELISA/CLIA-based methods are higher than LFIA devices.","Mohit, Elham; Rostami, Zahra; Vahidi, Hossein",Expert rev. clin. immunol,423,16

Pregnancy may lead to deterioration of the disease and negatively affect maternal and perinatal outcomes. However, the impact of peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) on reproductive outcomes has been understudied. Methods: A retrospective study on prospectively maintained database, including women aged 18-45 who underwent POEM during 2012-2017 at a university hospital. Results: During the study period, POEM was performed in 86 patients. Of them, 23 were women of childbearing age (median age 31.9 [26.0-40.7] years). Follow-up data were available for a median of 24 [16-41] months. Treatment success (Eckardt score <3) was achieved in 22 (95.7%) women. Six (26.1%) women reported attempting to conceive after POEM. Overall, 7 post-POEM pregnancies among 5 women were encountered. All 7 pregnancies were naturally conceived with a median surgery-to-conception interval of 16 [10-21] months. The median gestational weight gain was 10 kg, and was insufficient in all pregnancies. None of the women was hospitalized during the index gestation. All pregnancies resulted in term live-birth vaginal delivery. The median neonatal birthweight was 2940 g, with only one case of a small-for-gestational age infant. Achalasia-related symptoms recurred during 2 pregnancies, with resolution following delivery. Conclusions: Pregnancy after POEM for the treatment of achalasia was associated with favorable maternal and perinatal outcomes. This data should reassure women who wish to conceive following peroral myotomy.","Rottenstreich, Amihai; Brodie, Ronit; Marom, Gad; Jacob, Harold; Benson, Ariel; Mintz, Yoav","J. laparoendosc. adv. surg. tech., Part A",423,24

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the association between cytokine profiles and lung injury in COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted in COVID-19 patients. Demographic characteristics, symptoms, signs, underlying diseases, and laboratory data were collected. The patients were divided into COVID-19 with pneumonia and without pneumonia. CT severity score and PaO2/FiO2 ratio were used to assess lung injury. RESULTS: 106 patients with 12 COVID-19 without pneumonia and 94 COVID-19 with pneumonia were included. Compared with COVID-19 without pneumonia, COVID-19 with pneumonia had significantly higher serum interleukin (IL)-2R, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#945;. Correlation analysis showed that CT severity score and PaO2/FiO2 were significantly correlated with age, presence of any coexisting disorder, lymphocyte count, procalcitonin, IL-2R, and IL-6. In multivariate analysis, log IL6 was the only independent explanatory variables for CT severity score (ß = 0.397, p < 0.001) and PaO2/FiO2 (ß = - 0.434, p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Elevation of circulating cytokines was significantly associated with presence of pneumonia in COVID-19 and the severity of lung injury in COVID-19 pneumonia. Circulating IL-6 independently predicted the severity of lung injury in COVID-19 pneumonia.","Chen, Li-Da; Zhang, Zhen-Yu; Wei, Xiao-Jie; Cai, Yu-Qing; Yao, Weng-Zhen; Wang, Ming-Hui; Huang, Qiu-Fen; Zhang, Xiao-Bin",Respir Res,423,19

The progression from acute respiratory failure to sepsis has been correlated with the release of high-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1). Lack of effective conventional treatment of this septic state has spiked an interest in alternative medicine. This review of herbal extracts has identified multiple candidates which can target the release of HMGB1 and potentially reduce mortality by preventing progression from respiratory distress to sepsis. Some of the identified mixtures have also been shown to interfere with viral attachment. Due to the wide variability in chemical superstructure of the components of assorted herbal extracts, common motifs have been identified. Looking at the most active compounds in each extract it becomes evident that as a group, phenolic compounds have a broad enzyme inhibiting function. They have been shown to act against the priming of SARS-CoV-2 attachment proteins by host and viral enzymes, and the release of HMGB1 by host immune cells. An argument for the value in a nonspecific inhibitory action has been drawn.

The submission-to-acceptance [median: 5 days (IQR: 3-11) versus 71.5 days (38-106); P < .001] and acceptance-to-publication [median: 5 days (IQR: 2-8) versus 22.5 days (4-48·5-; P < .001] times were strikingly shorter for COVID-19. Almost all COVID-19 (n = 396; 99.5%) and MERS (n = 55; 100%) studies were open-access. Data sharing was infrequent, with original data available for 104 (26.1%) COVID-19 and 10 (18.2%) MERS studies (P = .203). The early academic response was characterized by investigators aiming to define the disease. Studies were made rapidly and openly available. Only one-in-four were published alongside original data, which is a key target for improvement.","Helliwell, Jack A; Bolton, William S; Burke, Joshua R; Tiernan, Jim P; Jayne, David G; Chapman, Stephen J",,423,2

GRP78 is a member of the 70 kDa heat shock family of proteins involved in correcting and clearing misfolded proteins in the ER. In response to cellular stress, GRP78 escapes from the ER and moves to the plasma membrane where it (a) functions as a receptor for many ligands, and (b) behaves as an autoantigen for autoantibodies that contribute to human disease and cancer. Cell surface GRP78 (csGRP78) associates with the major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I), and is the port of entry for several viruses, including the predictive binding of the novel SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, csGRP78 is found in association with partners as diverse as the teratocarcinoma-derived growth factor 1 (Cripto), the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) and the DnaJ-like protein MTJ-1. CsGRP78 also serves as a receptor for a large variety of ligands including activated &#945;2 -macroglobulin (&#945;2 M*), plasminogen kringle 5 (K5), microplasminogen, the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), tissue factor (TF), and the prostate apoptosis response-4 protein (Par-4).

The authors highlight the importance of the societal consequences of the outbreak and changes in the world of work to manage occupational health. The key points identified - such as individual socio-economic factors, psychological effects and occupations with highest risk of contamination - modify return-to-work approaches. It is estimated that around 800 million people of working age worldwide were living with disabilities before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In early January 2021, the cumulative COVID-19 hospitalisation rate reached 207.4/100 000 (18-49-year-olds) and 505.7/100 000 (50-64-year-olds), respectively, in the United States (3). In France, the hospitalisation rate was 411.5/100 000 across all ages (4). A recent cohort study of working-age men who were hospitalised for COVID-19 highlighted the long-term health consequences of such a disease (5). The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic creates new challenges for occupational health, shifting attention away from return-to-work after health problems to resuming work during an outbreak, dealing with lockdown, and taking special account of workers with vulnerabilities (6, 7). We recommend considering three different aspects of occupational medicine during a pandemic. Firstly, for most workers at high-risk of severe COVID-19, the issues of work disability and resuming work had never occurred before the epidemic. Recommendations such as physical and social distancing and wearing a facemask are highly advisable to protect against infection but may not be enough to enable some individuals to resume work. Therefore, decision-making requires individual comprehensive assessments of the underlying medical condition, the SARS-CoV-2 contamination risk associated with either regular work or teleworking, and vaccination opportunities. The second situation concerns workers who have suffered from COVID-19. Preliminary studies suggest that long recovery duration is related to high severity (7), but this is still a matter of debate for patients suffering from ""long COVID-19"" (5, 8, 9), a condition for which the long-term effects remain unknown. Any long-running recovery must be considered to be a potential sign of long COVID-19. These long-lasting syndromes occur among patients with severe symptoms but have also been reported independently of acute phase severity, hospitalisation and receiving medical oxygen (8, 9). Researchers worldwide are currently investigating such syndromes. Strategies promoting return to work for these workers will need to be implemented and could be similar to programmes developed for other chronic conditions. Moreover, numerous more serious sequelae following critical illness suggest the need for enhanced support by rehabilitation and occupational health specialists. Finally, the consequences of the epidemic must be evaluated over time for people who suffered from functional limitations before COVID-19 as their physical and mental condition may be modified by the epidemic and, specifically, the consequences of lockdown (10). In all of these situations, medical, social, financial and working contexts are key elements. In addition to a medical assessment, the use of scales such as the Work Ability Index (WAI) (11) or the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) (12) can help perform long-term follow-up and provide information about work capacity and workload. It also gives a ""back to basics"" perspective, urging politicians to move towards a `decent-work-for-all` policy, as advocated by the United Nation`s Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 8, which the WHO has endorsed (13).

Fox Insight is an ongoing prospective clinical research study that enables individuals to participate in clinical research from their own homes by completing online questionnaires. To date, over 45,000 participants with and without PD have enrolled. We sought to validate self-reported PD diagnosis in the Fox Insight cohort, assess the validity of other self-reported health information, and evaluate the willingness of participants to participate in video-based research studies. Methods Individuals with and without self-reported PD enrolled in Fox Insight were invited to participate in this virtual research study. Participants completed online questionnaires and two virtual visits, during which we conducted standard cognitive and motor assessments. A movement disorder expert determined the most likely diagnosis, which was compared to self-reported diagnosis. Results A total of 203 participants from 40 U.S. states, 159 with remote clinician-determined PD and 44 without, completed the study (59% male, mean (SD) age 65.7 (9.8)).

Azithromycin, in association with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, has been proposed as one such medication. The aim of this review is to describe the pharmacological mechanism, clinical evidence and prescribing guidelines concerning azithromycin in COVID-19 patients. There is weak evidence on the antiviral and immunomodulating effects of azithromycin, which in addition is not based on results from COVID-19 patients specifically. Therefore, this antibacterial should be considered only as empirical treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), although not all current treatment guidelines are in agreement. After the initial expectations raised by a small trial, more recent evidence has raised serious safety concerns on the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with azithromycin to treat COVID-19 patients, as all these drugs have arrhythmogenic potential. The World Health Organization has not made recommendations suggesting the use of azithromycin with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine as treatment for COVID-19, but some national organisations have taken a different position, recommending this as first-line treatment. Several scientific societies, including the American College of Cardiology, have cautioned about the risks of this treatment in view of the lack of evidence concerning its benefits.","Sultana, Janet; Cutroneo, Paola Maria; Crisafulli, Salvatore; Puglisi, Gabriele; Caramori, Gaetano; Trifirò, Gianluca",Drug Saf,423,16

New adjuvant formulations are required for the high vaccine demands, especially adjuvant formulations that induce a Th1 phenotype. Herein we assess a vaccination strategy using a combination of Alum and polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (Poly(I:C)) adjuvants plus the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in a prefusion trimeric conformation by an intradermal (ID) route. We found high levels of IgG anti-spike antibodies in the serum by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and high neutralizing titers against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro by neutralization assay, after one or two boosts. By evaluating the production of IgG subtypes, as expected, we found that formulations containing Poly(I:C) induced IgG2a whereas Alum did not. The combination of these two adjuvants induced high levels of both IgG1 and IgG2a. In addition, cellular immune responses of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells producing interferon-gamma were equivalent, demonstrating that the Alum + Poly(I:C) combination supported a Th1 profile. Based on the high neutralizing titers, we evaluated B cells in the germinal centers, which are specific for receptor-binding domain (RBD) and spike, and observed that more positive B cells were induced upon the Alum + Poly(I:C) combination. Moreover, these B cells produced antibodies against both RBD and non-RBD sites. We also studied the impact of this vaccination preparation (spike protein with Alum + Poly(I:C)) in the lungs of mice challenged with inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus. We found a production of IgG, but not IgA, and a reduction in neutrophil recruitment in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of mice, suggesting that our immunization scheme reduced lung inflammation. Altogether, our data suggest that Alum and Poly(I:C) together is a possible adjuvant combination for vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 by the intradermal route.","Santos, Juacutelio dos; Cruz, Luan Firmino; Fonseca-Martins, Alessandra Marcia da; Maciel, Diogo Oliveira; Perez, Gustavo Guadagnini; Roncaglia-Pereira, Victor Augusto; Dumard, Carlos H.; Silva, Francisca H.

The estimated average incidences were 269.1, 302.0, and 455.4/100,000 person-years in rapid recovery, slow recovery, and permanent decline scenarios. Compared with the rapid recovery scenario, the incremental number of mumps cases, total costs, and QALYs loss over the next 30 y were 6.53 million cases, 2.63 billion USD, and 49,246 for the permanent decline scenario, respectively. In conclusion, the persistent decline of mumps vaccination rate as an impact of COVID-19 causes a significant incremental disease burden of mumps, which is consistent irrespective of the possible decline of transmission rate of mumps infection, unless the rapid recovery of coverage rate is achieved. The immediate measures to advocate the vaccination program is essential to mitigate the incremental disease burden in the COVID-19 period.","Kitano, Taito; Aoki, Hirosato",Hum Vaccin Immunother,423,24

Scientific literature on the clinical data record of COVID-19 patients in Bangladesh is inadequate. Our study analyzes the clinical data of COVID-19 positive patients based on molecular identification and risk factor correlated with three variables (age, sex, residence) and COVID-19 prevalence in the four districts of Chattogram Division (Noakhali, Feni, Lakshmipur and Chandpur) with an aim to understand the trajectory of this pandemic in Chattogram, Southern Bangladesh. Methods: A cross-sectional study is conducted in the context of RT-PCR-based COVID-19 positive 5,589 individuals diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection from the COVID-19 testing laboratory, Abdul Malek Ukil Medical College, Noakhali-3800, Bangladesh. For molecular confirmation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), standard diagnostic protocols through real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) were conducted. Different patient demographics were analyzed using SPSS version 22 for exploring the relationship of three factors - age, sex, and residence with a cumulative number of COVID-19 positive cases and prevalence of COVID-19 in four districts in Chattogram division. The data was recorded between May to July, 2020. Results: Among the three parameters, the present study revealed that 20-40 cohort had the highest incidence of infection rate (51.80%, n=2895) among the different age groups. Among the infected individuals, 56.8% (n=3177) were male and 43.2% (n=2412) were female, denoting males being the most susceptible to this disease. Urban residents (52.7%, n=2948) were more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection than those residing in rural areas (47.3%, n=2641). The prevalence of COVID-19 positive cases among the four districts was recorded highest in the Noakhali district with 36.8% (n=2057), followed by the Feni, Lakshmipur and Chandpur districts with 25.9% (n=1448), 20.8% (n=1163) and 16.5% (n=921), respectively. Conclusions: This study presents a statistical correlation of certain factors linked to Bangladesh with confirmed COVID-19 patients, which will enable health practitioners and policy makers to take proactive steps to control and mitigate disease transmission.","Ali, Roushan; Chowdhury, Rayhan; Mas-Ud, Atik; Islam, Shirmin; Shimu, Ajmeri Sultana; Mina, Fahmida Begum; Sharmin, Nur E; Hasan, Faruk",Heliyon,423,1

Measures similar to those considered in Europe and other developed countries, such as maintaining social distance and lockdowns, were imposed. Lockdowns imposed a significant impact on the power sector, and this has been well explored in the literature for developed countries. A country-specific assessment of the impact of COVID-19 on the energy sector is crucial for future crisis management and underpinning sustainable power sector development plans. The impact of COVID-19 on Bangladesh's fossil-fuel dominated electricity sector is explored in this study. The analyses were conducted for 2019 and for the pandemic lockdown period in 2020. Daily hourly demand variations for different electricity generation zones in the country were investigated. The impact of these demand variations on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions was assessed through time-varying carbon intensity analysis. Nationwide, the analysis revealed that the maximum hourly demand reduced by about 14% between 5 and 6 pm whereas the minimum demand reduction (3%-4%) occurred between 7:30 and 8 pm. Peak time demand reduction was found to be minimal during lockdowns. The national absolute GHG emission reduced by about 1075 kt CO2e, an ∼16% reduction compared with that in 2019.

Moreover, lockdowns were imposed in entire countries. This study aims to assess whether there was a downward trend in emergency general surgery (EGS) procedures accomplished throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and to determine patients' and diseases' characteristics. METHODS: This is a multicentric retrospective observational cohort analysis conducted on patients who underwent EGS procedures during the lockdown and the same period of the previous year in the three Third Level Hospitals of Friuli Venezia Giulia, Italy. RESULTS: During the study period, 138 patients underwent EGS procedures versus the 197 patients operated on in 2019, meaning a 30.0% decrease in the number of surgeries performed. The incidence rate for EGS procedures was 2.5 surgeries per day during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to 3.5 surgeries per day in 2019 (P<0.001). The characteristics of patients operated on in 2020 were comparable to those of patients who underwent EGS in 2019, except for the higher prevalence of male patients during the COVID-19 pandemic (76.8 vs. 55.8; P<0.001). No difference was recorded in disease severity between the two study periods. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant reduction in EGS procedures carried out was recorded. However, no clear explanation can be given to elucidate this fact.","Bellio, Gabriele; Germani, Paola; Biloslavo, Alan; Del Zotto, Giulio; Lirusso, Chiara; Crestale, Sara; Silvestro, Roberto; Crespi, Stefania; Faion, Matteo; Ubiali, Paolo; DE Manzini, Nicolò",,423,11

Germicidal ultraviolet light, typically at 254 nm, is effective in this context but, used directly, can be a health hazard to skin and eyes. By contrast, far-UVC light (207-222 nm) efficiently kills pathogens potentially without harm to exposed human tissues. We previously demonstrated that 222-nm far-UVC light efficiently kills airborne influenza virus and we extend those studies to explore far-UVC efficacy against airborne human coronaviruses alpha HCoV-229E and beta HCoV-OC43. Low doses of 1.7 and 1.2 mJ/cm2 inactivated 99.9% of aerosolized coronavirus 229E and OC43, respectively. As all human coronaviruses have similar genomic sizes, far-UVC light would be expected to show similar inactivation efficiency against other human coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2. Based on the beta-HCoV-OC43 results, continuous far-UVC exposure in occupied public locations at the current regulatory exposure limit (~3 mJ/cm2/hour) would result in ~90% viral inactivation in ~8 minutes, 95% in ~11 minutes, 99% in ~16 minutes and 99.9% inactivation in ~25 minutes. Thus while staying within current regulatory dose limits, low-dose-rate far-UVC exposure can potentially safely provide a major reduction in the ambient level of airborne coronaviruses in occupied public locations.","Buonanno, Manuela; Welch, David; Shuryak, Igor; Brenner, David J",Sci Rep,423,25

Employing a text analytics or corpus linguistics approach, we show that state heads rhetorically lead their nations by: enforcing systemic interventions, upholding global unity, encouraging communal cooperation, stoking national fervor, and assuring responsive governance. Principal component analysis further shows that country-level rhetoric is organized along emergent dimensions of cultural cognition: an agency-structure axis to define the loci of pandemic interventions and a hierarchy-egalitarianism axis which distinguishes top-down enforcement from bottom-up calls for cooperation. Furthermore, we detect a striking contrast between countries featuring populist versus cosmopolitan rhetoric, which diverged in terms of their collective meaning making around leading over versus leading with, as well as their experienced pandemic severity. We conclude with implications for understanding global pandemic leadership in an unequal world and the contributions of mixed-methods approaches to a generative political psychology in times of crisis.","Montiel, Cristina Jayme; Uyheng, Joshua; Dela Paz, Erwine",Political psychology,423,27

Research with infectious severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is undertaken in high-containment laboratories; however, it is often desirable to work with samples at lower-containment levels. To facilitate the transfer of infectious samples from high-containment laboratories, we have tested methods commonly used to inactivate virus and prepare the sample for additional experiments. Incubation at 80°C, a range of detergents, Trizol reagents, and UV energies were successful at inactivating a high titer of SARS-CoV-2. Methanol and paraformaldehyde incubation of infected cells also inactivated the virus. These protocols can provide a framework for in-house inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 in other laboratories, ensuring the safe use of samples in lower-containment levels.","Patterson, Edward I; Prince, Tessa; Anderson, Enyia R; Casas-Sanchez, Aitor; Smith, Shirley L; Cansado-Utrilla, Cintia; Solomon, Tom; Griffiths, Michael J; Acosta-Serrano, Álvaro; Turtle, Lance; Hughes, Grant L",J Infect Dis,423,26

This has led to shortage of donor corneas worldwide. Glycerol preservation of tissue remains a viable option in this scenario. The objective is to compare fresh corneal tissue (FCT) with glycerol-preserved cornea (GPC) in emergency corneal transplantation. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study conducted in a tertiary care centre of Uttarakhand. Medical records of the patients who underwent therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty (TPK) were reviewed. FCT group included patients who underwent TPK with fresh corneal tissue and GPC group included patients who underwent TPK with glycerol preserved cornea. The indications and outcomes of TPK in the terms of therapeutic success were analysed and compared between both the groups. Results: A total of 94 eyes of 91 patients underwent TPK from October 2011 to August 2017. FCT group included 60 eyes of 57 patients and GPC group included 34 eyes of 34 patients. The primary indication of TPK was infectious keratitis in both the groups (FCT-81.6%; GPC - 91.2%) There was no significant difference in the therapeutic success in both the groups (P = 0.741, Odds ratio- 1.59 with 95% CI- 0.39-6.44). Complications included glaucoma (FCT-21.7%; GPC- 35.2%) graft infection (FCT- 18.33% GPC- 2.9%); graft rejection (FCT-11.66%, GPC- 0%); and graft failure (FCT-88.33%, GPC-100%). Conclusion: The GPC is comparable to FCTs in therapeutic transplant and can be a useful interim procedure in saving the eyes in cases of infective keratitis in the time of crisis.","Gupta, Neeti; Dhasmana, Renu; Maitreya, Amit; Badahur, Harsh",Indian J Ophthalmol,423,1

Our knowledge concerning every aspect of COVID-19 is evolving rapidly, given the increasing data from all over the world. In this narrative review, the Turkish Thoracic Society Early Career Taskforce members aimed to provide a summary on recent literature regarding epidemiology, clinical findings, diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and control of COVID-19. Studies revealed that the genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus showed significant identity to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor is an important target of the SARS-CoV-2 while entering an organism. Smokers were more likely to develop the disease and have a higher risk for ICU admission. The mean incubation period was 6.4 days, whereas asymptomatic transmission was reported up to 25 days after infection. Fever and cough were the most common symptoms, and cardiovascular diseases and hypertension were reported to be the most common comorbidities among patients. Clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic and mild disease to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. Several patients showed typical symptoms and radiological changes with negative RT-PCR but positive IgG and IgM antibodies. Although radiological findings may vary, bilateral, peripherally distributed, ground-glass opacities were typical of COVID-19. Poor prognosis was associated with older age, higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, and high D-dimer level. Chloroquine was found to be effective in reducing viral replication in vitro. Likewise, protease inhibitors, including lopinavir/ritonavir, favipiravir, and nucleoside analogue remdesivir were proposed to be the potential drug candidates in COVID-19 management. Despite these efforts, we still have much to learn regarding the transmission, treatment, and prevention of COVID-19.","Akyil, Fatma Tokgöz; Karadogan, Dilek; Gürkan, Canan Gündüz; Yüksel, Aycan; Arikan, Hüseyin; Eyüboglu, Tugba Sismanlar; Emiralioglu, Nagehan; Gürsoy, Tugba Ramasli; Serifoglu, Irem; Töreyin, Zehra Nur; Marim, Feride; Kara, Bilge Yilmaz; Özakinci, Hilal; Develi, Elif; Çakmakçi, Selin; Küsbeci, Tuba Çiftçi; Karcioglu, Oguz; Gülhan, Pinar Yildiz; Erçelik, Merve; Er, Berrin; Ataoglu, Özlem; Polat, Demet; Kaya, Ilknur; Önyilmaz, Tugba Asli; Aydin, Asena; Kizilirmak, Deniz; Er, Aslihan Banu; Kilinç, Mukaddes; Günaydin, Fatma Esra; Gürz, Selçuk; Karaoglanoglu, Selen; Çelik, Selma; Esendagli, Dorina; Toptay, Hüseyin; Sertçelik, Ümran Özden; Akgün, Metin",Turk Thorac J,423,29

METHODS: A cross-sectional, population-based online survey was conducted in China and abroad from January 28 to February 1, 2020. Socio-demographic information was collected and knowledge scores, practice scores, anxiety scores and perceived risk were calculated. General linear model and binary logistic regression were used to identify possible associations. RESULTS: We included 9,764 individuals in this study, and 156 (1.6%) were from Hubei Province. The average knowledge score was 4.7 (standard deviation, 1.0) (scored on a 6-point scale); 96.1% maintained hand hygiene, and 90.3% of participants had varying levels of anxiety. People in Hubei Province were the most anxious, followed by those in Beijing and Shanghai. People who had experienced risk behaviors did not pay more attention to wearing masks and hand hygiene. CONCLUSIONS: The public had high awareness on knowledge of COVID-19 outbreak, and a high proportion of people practiced good hand hygiene behavior. Many people claimed anxiety, especially in heavily affected areas during pandemic, suggesting the importance of closing the gap between risk awareness and good practice and conduct psychological counseling to public and patients.","Han, Bingfeng; Zhao, Tianshuo; Liu, Bei; Liu, Hanyu; Zheng, Hui; Wan, Yongmei; Qiu, Jiayi; Zhuang, Hui; Cui, Fuqiang",J. epidemiol,423,30

The goal of this consensus statement is to examine the current evidence for performing tracheostomy in patients with respiratory failure from COVID-19 and offer guidance to physicians on the preparation, timing, and technique while minimizing the risk of infection to health care workers (HCWs). METHODS: A panel including intensivists and interventional pulmonologists from three professional societies representing 13 institutions with experience in managing patients with COVID-19 across a spectrum of health-care environments developed key clinical questions addressing specific topics on tracheostomy in COVID-19. A systematic review of the literature and an established modified Delphi consensus methodology were applied to provide a reliable evidence-based consensus statement and expert panel report. RESULTS: Eight key questions, corresponding to 14 decision points, were rated by the panel. The results were aggregated, resulting in eight main recommendations and five additional remarks intended to guide health-care providers in the decision-making process pertinent to tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19-related respiratory failure. CONCLUSION: This panel suggests performing tracheostomy in patients expected to require prolonged mechanical ventilation. A specific timing of tracheostomy cannot be recommended. There is no evidence for routine repeat reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing in patients with confirmed COVID-19 evaluated for tracheostomy.

The present study investigated the effects of Mg++ supplementation on preventing CS-induced muscle atrophy in an animal model, which provided experimental data for potential clinical translation. METHODS: Twelve 24-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and CS methylprednisolone (MPS) to induce muscle atrophy, with half of the rats also given daily 50 mg/kg Mg++ oral supplementation. Additional six rats without LPS + CS treatments were used as normal controls. After treatment for 6 weeks, serum was collected for Mg++ quantification, animal dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was performed for tissue composition, and the extensor digitorum longus (EDL) was collected for muscle functional test and histology including muscle fiber size, intramuscular fat infiltration and fiber typing. In vitro myotube atrophy model was used to study the in vitro effect associated with in vivo muscle atrophy. RESULTS: LPS + CS treatments induced hypomagnesemia while the serum Mg++ level was in normal range after Mg++ supplementation. DXA showed 53.0% lower fat percent and 29.7% higher lean mass in LPS + CS + Mg group when compared to LPS + CS group. Muscle functional test showed 22.2% higher specific twitch force and 40.3% higher specific tetanic force in LPS + CS + Mg group when compared to LPS + CS group. Histological analysis showed 4.1% higher proportion of muscle fibers area to total area and 63.6% lower intramuscular fat infiltration in EDL sections in LPS + CS + Mg group when compared to LPS + CS group. LPS + CS + Mg group had 33.0% higher area proportion and 29.4% higher cross-sectional area (CSA) of type IIb muscle fiber. Myoblast culture results showed that Mg++ supplementation group had larger myotube diameter. The mRNA expressions of the muscle atrophy marker genes MuRF1 and MAFbx were lower in Mg++ supplementation group both in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSION: The current study demonstrated that Mg++ supplementation successfully alleviated CS-associated muscle atrophy in rats at both functional and morphology levels, indicating a translational potential for patients undergoing CS therapy. This study provided the evidence for the first time that Mg++ supplementation could prevent muscle atrophy-an adverse effect of CS therapy, currently also adopted for treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).","Zheng, Lizhen; Huang, Le; Chen, Ziyi; Cui, Can; Zhang, Ri; Qin, Ling",Eur. j. nutr,423,24

Several studies suggest that cytokine storms (interleukins) may play an important role in severe cases of COVID-19. Neutralizing key inflammatory factors in cytokine release syndrome (CRS) could therefore be of great value in reducing the mortality rate. Tocilizumab (TCZ) in its intravenous (IV) form of administration -RoActemra® 20â¯mg/mL (Roche)- is indicated for treatment of severe CRS patients. Preliminary investigations have concluded that inhibition of IL-6 with TCZ appears to be efficacious and safe, with several ongoing clinical trials. This has led to a huge increase in demand for IV TCZ for treating severe COVID-19 patients in hospitals, which has resulted in shortages. Here, we present a comparability study assessing the main critical physicochemical attributes of TCZ solutions used for infusion, at 6â¯mg/mL and 4â¯mg/mL, prepared from RoActeram® 20â¯mg/mL (IV form) and from RoActemra® 162â¯mg (0.9â¯mL solution pre-filled syringe, subcutaneous form), to evaluate the use of the latter for preparing clinical solutions required for IV administration, so that in a situation of shortage of the IV medicine, the SC form could be used to prepare the solutions for IV delivery of TCZ. It is important to remember that during the current pandemic all the medicines are used off-label, since none of them has yet been approved for the treatment of COVID-19.","Navas, Natalia; Hermosilla, Jesús; Torrente-López, Anabel; Hernández, José; Cabeza, Jose; Pérez-Robles, Raquel; Salmerón-García, Antonio",,423,16

The Role of Tech in Improving Endocrine Therapy Adherence: With Kathryn Ruddy, MD, a medical oncologist at Mayo Clinic",18.132446,7.931874,2020,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) relies on clinical features and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing, but the sensitivity is limited. Carotid CTA is a routine acute stroke investigation and includes the lung apices. We evaluated CTA as a potential COVID-19 diagnostic imaging biomarker. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a multicenter, retrospective study (n = 225) including CTAs of patients with suspected acute stroke from 3 hyperacute stroke units (March-April 2020). We evaluated the reliability and accuracy of candidate diagnostic imaging biomarkers. Demographics, clinical features, and risk factors for COVID-19 and stroke were analyzed using univariate and multivariate statistics. RESULTS: Apical ground-glass opacification was present in 22.2% (50/225) of patients. Ground-glass opacification had high interrater reliability (Fleiss &#954; = 0.81; 95% CI, 0.68-0.95) and, compared with reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, had good diagnostic performance (sensitivity, 75% [95% CI, 56-87]; specificity, 81% [95% CI, 71-88]; OR = 11.65 [95% CI, 4.14-32.78]; P < .001) on multivariate analysis. In contrast, all other contemporaneous demographic, clinical, and imaging features available at CTA were not diagnostic for COVID-19. The presence of apical ground-glass opacification was an independent predictor of increased 30-day mortality (18.0% versus 5.7%, P = .017; hazard ratio = 3.51; 95% CI, 1.42-8.66; P = .006). CONCLUSIONS: We identified a simple, reliable, and accurate COVID-19 diagnostic and prognostic imaging biomarker obtained from CTA lung apices: the presence or absence of ground-glass opacification. Our findings have important implications in the management of patients presenting with suspected stroke through early identification of COVID-19 and the subsequent limitation of disease transmission.","Siddiqui, J; Bala, F; Sciacca, S; Falzon, A M; Benger, M; Matloob, S A; Miller, F N A C; Simister, R J; Chatterjee, I; Sztriha, L K; Davagnanam, I; Booth, T C",AJNR am. j. neuroradiology,423,1

Nevertheless, high risk heart failure (HF) pts continued to require close management. To overcome this predicament, at our institution pts were asked to stay at home and engage in virtual HF visits (VHFVs) via telephone or video, in lieu of in-office visits (IOVs). Objective The purpose of this abstract is to report patient satisfaction with VHFVs during the initial 30 day surge of COVID 19, compared to their satisfaction with IOVs over the preceding 3 months. Methods The Montefiore- Einstein Heart Failure service cares for over 4,000 pts who predominantly reside within the Bronx borough, and represent a vulnerable, urban, low socioeconomic population. Our team includes 12 providers consisting of both NPs and MDs. On 3/17/20 all non-urgent IOVs were stopped, and as a work around a virtual platform was created within our electronic medical record system (EPIC) to facilitate VHFVs. As of April 1st, all IOVs were converted to VHFVs, with few exceptions. We retrospectively identified all HF pts (N=502) who engaged in VHFVs (N=609) during the month of April, 2020. Those pts who also had IOVs within the preceding 90 days made up the survey cohort (N=283). A patient satisfaction survey was created in English and Spanish, using a 5 point Likert Scale. The survey was administered by phone, in the subjects' native language. Results The survey was completed by 117 of the 283 eligible subjects (41%), with clinical characteristics as described (Table 1). In 5 of 8 categories of patient satisfaction, pts indicated that they preferred IOVs to VHFVs (Figure 1). IOVs and VHFV were equally ranked in regard to the scheduled appointment time, and also how well pts were listened to and understood by the clinician. Only the convenience of VHFVs was favored more. Nevertheless, 90% of pts were willing to have another VHFV if necessary. Conclusion Even in the setting of a pandemic and despite the convenience (of time, cost and travel), pts overall tended to prefer IOVs to VHFVs, yet remained open to engaging in future VHFV if necessary. Given the unique situation of the COVID-19 surge during the conduct of this survey, the results may not reflect patient satisfaction during ordinary times.","Galvao, Marie Christian Norma Farooq Muhammad Hickey Jeanne Jorde Ulrich Patel Snehal Salkey Kalil Seth Newman Sicilia Sabrina",Heart &amp; Lung,423,22

However, the impact of the pandemic and national emergency measures on the number of non-COVID-19 presentations and the assessed acuity of those presentations remain uncertain. METHODS: We acquired a retrospective cohort containing all ED visits in a Finnish secondary care hospital during years 2018, 2019 and 2020. We compared the number of presentations in 2020 during the national state of emergency, i.e. from March 16 to June 11, with numbers from 2018 and 2019. Presentations were stratified using localized New York University Emergency Department Algorithm (NYU-EDA) to evaluate changes in presentations with different acuity levels. RESULTS: A total of 27,526 presentations were observed. Compared to previous two years, total daily presentations were reduced by 23% (from 113 to 87, p < .001). In NYU-EDA classes, Non-Emergent visits were reduced the most by 42% (from 18 to 10, p < .001). Emergent presentations were reduced by 19 to 28% depending on the subgroup (p < .001). Number of injuries were reduced by 25% (from 27 to 20, p < .001). The NYU-EDA distribution changed statistically significantly with 4% point reduction in Non-Emergent visits (from 16 to 12%, p < .001) and 0.9% point increase in Alcohol-related visits (from 1.6 to 2.5%, p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: We observed a significant reduction in total ED visits in the course of national state of emergency. Presentations were reduced in most of the NYU-EDA groups irrespective of the assessed acuity. A compensatory increase in presentations was not observed in the course of the 3 month lockdown. This implies either reduction in overall morbidity caused by decreased societal activity or widespread unwillingness to seek required medical advice.","Tuominen, Jalmari; Hällberg, Ville; Oksala, Niku; Palomäki, Ari; Lukkarinen, Timo; Roine, Antti",BMC Emerg Med,423,26

In OA patients joint tissue damage only poorly associates with pain, indicating other mechanisms contribute to OA pain. Immune cells regulate the sensory system, but little is known about their involvement in OA pain. Here we report that macrophages accumulate in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) distant from the site of injury in two rodent models of OA. DRG macrophages acquired a M1-like phenotype and depletion of DRG macrophages resolved OA pain in male and female mice. Sensory neurons innervating the damaged knee joint shape DRG macrophages into a M1-like phenotype. Persisting OA pain, accumulation of DRG macrophages, and their programming into M1-like phenotype was independent of Nav1.8 nociceptors. Inhibition of M1-like macrophages in the DRG, by intrathecal injection of a IL4-IL10 fusion protein or M2-like macrophages resolved persistent OA pain. In conclusion, these findings reveal a crucial role for macrophages in maintaining OA pain independent of the joint damage and suggest a new direction to treat OA pain.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTIn osteoarthritis (OA) patients pain poorly correlates with joint tissue changes indicating mechanisms other than only tissue damage cause pain in OA. We identified that DRG containing the somata of sensory neurons innervating the damaged knee are infiltrated with macrophages that are shaped into a M1-like phenotype by sensory neurons. We show that these DRG macrophages actively maintain OA pain remotely and independent of joint damage. The phenotype of these macrophages is crucial for their pain promoting role. Targeting the phenotype of DRG macrophages with either M2-like macrophages or a cytokine fusion protein that skews macrophages into M2-like phenotype OA pain resolves pain. Our works reveals a mechanism that contributes to the maintenance of OA pain distant from the affected knee joint and suggest that dorsal root ganglia macrophages are a target to treat osteoarthritis chronic pain.","Raoof, Ramin; Martin Gil, Christian; Lafeber, Floris P J G; de Visser, Huub M; Prado, Judith; Versteeg, Sabine; Pascha, Mirte N; Heinemans, Anne L P; Adolfs, Youri; Pasterkamp, R Jeroen; Wood, John N; Mastbergen, Simon C; Eijkelkamp, Niels",J. neurosci,423,16

The Asian National Cancer Centres Alliance and the Asia-Pacific Organisation for Cancer Prevention collaborated to assess the mid- and long- term impact of COVID-19 to cancer care in Asia. METHODS: The two entities organised a combined symposium and post-meeting interactions among representatives of major cancer centres from seventeen Asian countries to outlining major challenges and countermeasures. RESULTS: Participating stakeholders distilled five big questions. 1) ""Will there be an explosion of late-stage cancers after the pandemic?"" To address and recover from perceived delayed prevention, screening, treatment and care challenges, collaboration of key stakeholders in the region and alignment in cancer care management, policy intervention and cancer registry initiatives would be of essential value. 2) ""Operations and Finance"" The pandemic has resulted in significant material and financial casualties. Flagged acute challenges (shortages of supplies, imposition of lockdown) as well as longer-standing reduction of financial revenue, manpower, international collaboration, and training should also be addressed. 3) ""Will telemedicine and technological innovations revolutionize cancer care?"" Deploying and implementing telemedicine such as teleconsultation and virtual tumour boards were considered invaluable. These innovations could become a new regular practice, leading to expansion of tele-collaboration through collaboration of institutions in the region. 4) ""Will virtual conferences continue after the pandemic?"" Virtual conferences during the pandemic have opened new doors for knowledge sharing, especially for representatives of low- and middle-income countries in the region, while saving time and costs of travel. 5) ""How do we prepare for the next pandemic or international emergency?"" Roadmaps for action to improve access to appropriate patient care and research were identified and scrutinised. CONCLUSION: Through addressing these five big questions, focused collaboration among members and with international organisations such as City Cancer Challenge will allow enhanced preparedness for future international emergencies.<br />.","Gatellier, Laureline; Shankar, Abhishek; Dewi, Luh K Mela; Hussain, Quazi Mushtaq; Dendup Wangdi, Tashi; Sukumaran, Dato Babu; Sari, Nina Kemala; Tavakkoli Shiraji, Sahar; Biglari, Mohammad; Tahmasebi, Mamak; Iwata, Satoshi; Suzuki, Tatsuya; Myung, Seung-Kwon; Chun, June Young; Han, Jong Soo; Lau, Fen Nee; Yusak, Suhana; Bayarsaikhan, Luvsandorj; Mu, Khin Thin; Pradhananga, Kishore K; Yusuf, Aasim; Lin, Ching-Hung; Chiang, Ruru Chun-Ju; Sangrajran, Suleeporn; Nguyen, Quang Tien; Huong, Giang Nguyen; Soe, Aung Naing; Sharma, D N; Sengar, Manju; Pramesh, C S; Matsuda, Tomohiro; Jarrahi, Alireza Mosavi; Hwang, William",Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,423,1

If sick or healthy, or both, predominantly socially distance, the epidemic curve flattens. Contact reductions may occur for different reasons during a pandemic including health-related mobility loss (severity of symptoms), duty of care for a member of a high-risk group, and forced quarantine. Other decisions to reduce contacts are of a more voluntary nature. In particular, sick people reduce contacts consciously to avoid infecting others, and healthy individuals reduce contacts in order to stay healthy. We use game theory to formalize the interaction of voluntary social distancing in a partially infected population. This improves the behavioral micro-foundations of epidemiological models, and predicts differential social distancing rates dependent on health status. The model's key predictions in terms of comparative statics are derived, which concern changes and interactions between social distancing behaviors of sick and healthy. We fit the relevant parameters for endogenous social distancing to an epidemiological model with evidence from influenza waves to provide a benchmark for an epidemic curve with endogenous social distancing. Our results suggest that spreading similar in peak and case numbers to what partial immobilization of the population produces, yet quicker to pass, could occur endogenously. Going forward, eventual social distancing orders and lockdown policies should be benchmarked against more realistic epidemic models that take endogenous social distancing into account, rather than be driven by static, and therefore unrealistic, estimates for social mixing that intrinsically overestimate spreading.","Gosak, Marko; Kraemer, Moritz U G; Nax, Heinrich H; Perc, Matjaz; Pradelski, Bary S R",Sci Rep,423,16

We propose an algorithmic approach using cardiac biomarkers to triage, risk-stratify and prognosticate patients with severe COVID-19. METHODS: We systematically searched the PubMed and Google Scholar databases until May 31st, 2020, and accessed the available data on the role of cardiac biomarkers in patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: COVID-19 is associated with acute cardiac injury in around 7-28% of patients, significantly increasing its associated complications and mortality. Patients with underlying cardiovascular disease are more prone to develop acute cardiac injury as a result of COVID-19. The use of cardiac biomarkers may aid in differentiating the cardiac cause of dyspnea in patients with severe COVID-19. Cardiac biomarkers may also aid in triaging, risk-stratification, clinical decision-making, and prognostication of patients with COVID-19. However, there are concerns that routine testing in all patients with COVID-19 irrespective of severity, may result in unnecessary downstream investigations which may be misleading. In this brief review, using an algorithmic approach, we have tried to rationalize the use of cardiac biomarkers among patients with severe COVID-19. This approach is also likely to lessen the infection exposure risk to the cardiovascular team attending patients with severe COVID-19. CONCLUSION: It appears beneficial to triage, risk-stratify, and prognosticate patients with COVID-19 based on the evidence of myocardial injury and the presence of underlying cardiovascular disease. Future research studies are, however, needed to validate these proposed benefits.","Mahajan, Kunal; Chand Negi, Prakash; Ganju, Neeraj; Asotra, Sanjeev",Diabetes Metab Syndr,423,10

For example, in patients with radicular pain associated with intervertebral disc herniation or lumbar spinal stenosis, epidural steroid injections (ESI) are commonly used and often improve pain and function while avoiding more invasive surgical approaches. Recently, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has allowed remote evaluations to mitigate COVID-19 transmission using telemedicine. In this article, we review our experience in using telemedicine for interventional pain care and current literature, providing a framework for current practice and future study. During restrictive periods of COVID-19 mitigation, patients were referred for ESI, evaluated by telemedicine, and then seen in-person for a physical exam and possible ESI. After a chart review of these patients, we found that telemedicine evaluation was successfully used to support decision making about the ESI. The majority of patients referred received an ESI. During the interval between telemedicine evaluation and ESI, there was no evidence of progression of disease or neurologic deterioration. There were no emergency room visits due to pain complaints. In our literature review, similar case series supported the use of telemedicine in planning and supporting procedural care in several clinical specialties, including interventional pain management. Future research in larger cohorts will help rigorously evaluate safety and query satisfaction for both patients and providers. In conclusion, we suggest that using telemedicine to support procedural care requires more research but shows promise in increasing access to interventional pain care. The use of telemedicine has recently seen a sharp increase in frequency due to the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic. According to the World Health Organization, telemedicine represents ""healing at a distance""1 . They define telemedicine as ""the delivery of healthcare services by health care professionals using information and communication technologies for the exchange of valid information for the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease and injuries."" Telemedicine has become an important and effective option for providing patient care. However, the use of telemedicine in the context of procedural therapies for pain management is new and rapidly evolving. In this commentary, we aimed to review literature and share our experience in integrating telemedicine in procedural care.","Alter, Benedict J; Navlani, Rohit; Abdullah, Leath; Wasan, Ajay D; Heres, Edward",Pain med,423,20

METHODS: We performed an analysis assessing the utility of apical lung exam on computed tomography angiography for COVID-19-specific lung findings in 57 patients presenting with AIS. We measured the diagnostic accuracy of apical lung assessment alone and in combination with patient-reported symptoms and incorporate both to propose a COVID-19 era AIS algorithm. RESULTS: Apical lung assessment when used in isolation, yielded a sensitivity of 0.67, specificity of 0.93, positive predictive value of 0.19, negative predictive value of 0.99, and accuracy of 0.92 for the diagnosis of COVID-19, in patients presenting to the hospital for AIS. When combined with self-reported clinical symptoms of cough or shortness of breath, sensitivity of apical lung assessment improved to 0.83. CONCLUSIONS: Apical lung assessment on computed tomography angiography is an accurate screening tool for COVID-19 and can serve as part of a combined screening approach in AIS.","Esenwa, Charles; Lee, Ji-Ae; Nisar, Taha; Shmukler, Anna; Goldman, Inessa; Zampolin, Richard; Hsu, Kevin; Labovitz, Daniel; Altschul, David; Haramati, Linda B",Stroke,423,16

In this context, males seem to not only be more susceptible to the infection compared to female subjects, at least in Western countries, but their case fatality rate attributable to SARS-CoV-2 infection is also highest. Therefore, we may speculate that the different hormonal milieu could have a more profound pathophysiological role in association with SARS-CoV-2, with endogenous testosterone leaving men more prone to develop more serious complications related to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Another option is that SARS-CoV-2 infection per se causes an acute stage of male hypogonadism, the depletion of androgenic action triggering serious or an even fatal course of the disease. Therefore, we strongly advocate the development of a prospective multidimensional andrological translational research project in men, which we called the PROTEGGIMI study. In this Opinion Article, we will not only highlight novel research activity in this area but also invite other researchers and learned scientific societies to join us in our efforts to understand an important and very newly discovered gap in knowledge, which may have serious implications for the lives of millions of men.","Salonia, Andrea; Corona, Giovanni; Giwercman, Aleksander; Maggi, Mario; Minhas, Suks; Nappi, Rossella E; Sofikitis, Nikolaos; Vignozzi, Linda",Androl.

Several recent studies suggest that a significant number of COVID-19 patients display no physical symptoms whatsoever. Therefore, it is unlikely that these patients will undergo COVID-19 test, which increases their chances of unintentionally spreading the virus. Currently, the primary diagnostic tool to detect COVID-19 is RT-PCR test on collected respiratory specimens from the suspected case. This requires patients to travel to a laboratory facility to be tested, thereby potentially infecting others along the way.It is evident from recent researches that asymptomatic COVID-19 patients cough and breath in a different way than the healthy people. Several research groups have created mobile and web-platform for crowdsourcing the symptoms, cough and breathing sounds from healthy, COVID-19 and Non-COVID patients. Some of these data repositories were made public. We have received such a repository from Cambridge University team under data-sharing agreement, where we have cough and breathing sound samples for 582 and 141 healthy and COVID-19 patients, respectively. 87 COVID-19 patients were asymptomatic, while rest of them have cough.

Overall, 122 head physicians participated in this survey, with a homogeneous distribution on the national territory. Results show that the following measures for oncologic patients have been promptly implemented through the whole country: use of protective devices, triage of patients accessing the hospital, delay of non-urgent visits and use of telemedicine. Results of this survey suggest that Italian oncology departments have promptly set a proactive approach to the actual emergency.

European research on anxiety and stress among hospital workers during the pandemic is limited. This study aimed to describe the anxiety levels of Finnish hospital workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The multidimensional, cross-sectional survey was distributed to all hospital staff working at two Finnish specialized medical care centres in the spring of 2020 (n = 1,995). The Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale was used to measure the workers' anxiety. RESULTS: The total mean GAD-7 score was 4.88, indicating normal anxiety levels. However, 30% (n = 1,079) of the respondents had mild, 10% (n = 194) moderate and 5% (n = 88) severe anxiety. Key risk factors were young age, working in a university hospital, problems in cooperation between co-workers, difficulty concentrating at work, a health-threatening physical and psychological workload, and a fear of being infected at work. CONCLUSION: Hospital staff experienced a variety of work-related stress and anxiety issues that should be visible to hospital administrators and policymakers alike. The anxiety is independent of whether the worker is directly involved in caring for or in any way coming into contact with COVID-19 patients. Key message Fifty-five percent of hospital staff have normal anxiety levels. The remaining workers may need targeted support interventions, and a smaller proportion (15%) are in danger of developing longer-term problems affecting their well-being. The anxiety experienced by hospital workers during the COVID-19 pandemic is more severe than that of the population on average. If the pandemic continues, the well-being of hospital staff may be widely threatened. Despite the different geographical locations and COVID-19 situations, hospital workers in Finland and China had similar anxiety levels. The anxiety is independent of whether staff are working in the front line of managing the COVID-19 pandemic or of the number of covid-19 patients admitted to the hospital. The hospital workers felt anxiety because they were facing a new situation which causes changes in their work and daily routine. Health care employers should engage in long-term follow-up as regards the personnel's recovery from the burden caused by the pandemic and from work in general. It is necessary to make easily attainable, flexibly delivered and cost-effective treatment interventions for anxiety available to hospital staff.","Mattila, Elina; Peltokoski, Jaana; Neva, Marko H; Kaunonen, Marja; Helminen, Mika; Parkkila, Anna-Kaisa",Ann Med,423,24

This innovation is, however, inseparable from the influence of e-service quality, an antecedent factor of online sales. The research goal was on determination and ascertainment of the extent of requiring e-customer satisfaction to significantly boost e-customer loyalty. The research employed a survey method and an explanatory follow-up design. 203 respondents having implemented online sales in West Kalimantan successfully returned the questionnaires to researchers. The whole data was collected and processed through Likert Scales, the SEM-PLS analysis tool, and FGDs with 5 key informants. A finding indicates that it is uncertain that e-customer satisfaction is crucially needed for the improvement of e-customer loyalty. It, conversely, turns out that process quality and service recovery undoubtedly have direct, significant influences on e-customer loyalty. In addition to the finding, there is the insignificance of outcome quality for this loyalty. © 2021 Karadeniz Technical University.

This report describes a COVID-19 patient treated with nafamostat and heparin to prevent circuit thrombosis during ECMO support. Case presentation: A 63-year-old man was transferred to our hospital with respiratory failure due to COVID-19 pneumonia. He was provided venous-venous ECMO to maintain oxygenation. During ECMO support, occlusive circuit thrombosis developed despite systemic anticoagulation therapy with heparin. He was subsequently administered combination therapy with nafamostat and heparin. Although the combination therapy could prevent circuit thrombosis, it was converted to heparin monotherapy because of hyperkalemia and hemothorax. After tracheostomy and a gradual improvement in oxygenation, ECMO was discontinued. He was transferred to another hospital for further rehabilitation. Conclusion: Combination therapy with nafamostat and heparin can prevent circuit thrombosis during ECMO. However, bleeding can still develop with this combination therapy during ECMO.","Doi, Shunichi; Akashi, Yoshihiro J; Takita, Mumon; Yoshida, Hideki; Morikawa, Daiki; Ishibashi, Yuki; Higuma, Takumi; Fujitani, Shigeki",Acute medicine &amp; surgery,423,16

Such dietary inadequacies may be detrimental for their current and future health. Schools are favorable settings to establish healthy eating practices. Still, no school meal arrangement is provided in Norway, and most children typically bring packed lunches from home. The aim of this study was to investigate whether serving a free healthy school meal for one year resulted in a higher intake of fruit and vegetables and a lower intake of unhealthy snacks in total among 10-12-year-olds in Norway. METHODS: The School Meal Project in Southern Norway was a non-randomized trial in two elementary schools in rural areas in the school year 2014/2015. The study sample consisted of 10- to 12-year-old children; an intervention group (N = 55) and a control group (N = 109) resulting in a total of 164 school children at baseline. A food frequency questionnaire was completed by the children at baseline, at five months follow-up and after one year to assess fruit, vegetable, and snacks intake. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to assess intervention effects on overall intake of fruit and vegetables and unhealthy snacks. RESULTS: Serving of a free healthy school meal for one year was associated with a higher weekly intake of vegetables on sandwiches in the intervention group compared to the control group, adjusted for baseline intake (B: 1.11 (95% CI: .38, 1.85)) at the end of the intervention. No other significant intervention effects were found for the remaining fruit and vegetables measures. Serving of a free healthy school meal was not associated with a lower weekly intake of unhealthy snacks (i.e. potato chips, candy, sugar sweetened beverages) in the intervention group compared to the control group. CONCLUSIONS: A free healthy school meal was associated with a higher weekly intake of vegetables on sandwiches but did not significantly change any other investigated dietary behaviors. However, given the inadequate intake of vegetables among children and that even moderate improvements have public health relevance, a free healthy school meal for all school children could be beneficial.

Advanced analysis of brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used to find brain abnormalities and their relationship to neurocognitive impairments in children and adolescents with DS. Because genetic factors affect brain development in early fetal life, there is a growing interest in analyzing brains from living fetuses with DS. In this study, we investigated regional sulcal folding depth as well as global cortical gyrification from fetal brain MRIs. Nine fetuses with DS (29.1 ± 4.24 gestational weeks [mean ± standard deviation]) were compared with 17 typically developing [TD] fetuses (28.4 ± 3.44). Fetuses with DS showed lower whole-brain average sulcal depths and gyrification index than TD fetuses. Significant decreases in sulcal depth were found in bilateral Sylvian fissures and right central and parieto-occipital sulci. On the other hand, significantly increased sulcal depth was shown in the left superior temporal sulcus, which is related to atypical hemispheric asymmetry of cortical folding. Moreover, these group differences increased as gestation progressed. This study demonstrates that regional sulcal depth is a sensitive marker for detecting alterations of cortical development in DS during fetal life, which may be associated with later neurocognitive impairment.","Yun, Hyuk Jin; Perez, Juan David Ruiz; Sosa, Patricia; Valdés, J Alejandro; Madan, Neel; Kitano, Rie; Akiyama, Shizuko; Skotko, Brian G; Feldman, Henry A; Bianchi, Diana W; Grant, P Ellen; Tarui, Tomo; Im, Kiho",Cereb. cortex,423,25

Investigating the current evidence is therefore crucial in this pandemic, as early rehabilitation could be effective for the functioning of patients with multiple organ failure. This rapid review assesses the effectiveness of rehabilitation interventions in adults with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. METHODS: A rapid review was conducted including only randomised control trials, published until 30 November 2020. All databases were investigated and the results synthesized narratively, evaluating the risk of bias and quality of evidence in all included studies. RESULTS: A total of 404 records were identified through database searches. After removal of duplicates 346 articles remained. After screening, 3 studies (90 participants) met the inclusion criteria. All studies reported positive effects of neuromuscular electrical stimulation on muscle mass preservation compared with no treatment or standard physio-therapy. CONCLUSION: The lack of evidence on the effectiveness of rehabilitation interventions does not allow any firm conclusion to be drawn. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation might be a possible rehabilitation intervention to prevent muscle volume loss and improve function in patients with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. However, further studies are needed to support these preliminary findings.","Arienti, Chiara; Lazzarini, Stefano; Pollini, Elisa; Patrini, Michele; Kiekens, Carlotte; Negrini, Stefano",J. rehabil. med,423,29

Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, universities worldwide have left the classroom to provide the method of teaching virtually, generating challenges, adaptations, and more stress in students. In this pilot study, a methodology for academic stress detection in engineering students at the University of Pamplona (Colombia) is proposed by developing and implementing an artificial electronic nose system and the galvanic skin response. For the study, the student’s stress state and characteristics were taken into account to make the data analysis where a set of measurements were acquired when the students were presenting a virtual exam.

The paper outlines a psychoanalytically grounded semiotic-cultural psychological interpretation of such a scenario. First, we underline how the actual emotional reaction (mainly of fear) of our society is a marker of how the mind functions in conditions of affective activation related to heightened uncertainty: it produces global, homogenizing and generalizing embodied interpretations of reality, at the cost of more fine-grained and differentiated analytical thought. Such a process, called affective semiosis, represents an adaptive response to the emergency in the short-term. Second, we argue that this adaptive value provided by affective semiosis will be reduced when we have to deal with the process of managing the transition to the post-crisis and the governance of the medium and long-term impact of the crisis. Third, we suggest that, in order to manage the pandemic crisis on a longer temporal frame, affective semiosis has to be integrated with less generalized and more domain-specific ways of interpreting reality. To this end, semiotic capital (i.e., culturally-mediated symbolic resources) should be promoted in order to enable people to interiorize the supra-individual and collective dimension of life. Accordingly, COVID-19 is proposed as a semiotic vaccine, a disruption in our everyday life routines which has the potential of opening the way to a semiotic re-appropriation of the collective dimensions of our experience.","Venuleo, Claudia; Gelo, Omar C.G.; Salvatore, Sergio",Clin.

Several lung ultrasound (US) protocols for pneumonia diagnosis are used in clinical practice, but none has been proposed for COVID-19 patients' screening in the emergency department. We adopted a simplified 6-scan lung US protocol for COVID-19 pneumonia diagnosis (LUSCOP) and compared its sensitivity with high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) in patients suspected for COVID-19, presenting to one Emergency Department from February 21st to March 15th, 2020, during the outbreak burst in northern Italy. Patients were retrospectively enrolled if both LUSCOP protocol and HRCT were performed in the Emergency Department. The sensitivity of LUSCOP protocol and HRCT were compared. COVID-19 pneumonia's final diagnosis was based on real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction from nasal-pharyngeal swab and on clinical data. Out of 150 suspected COVID-19 patients, 131 were included in the study, and 130 had a final diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. The most frequent lung ultrasonographic features were: bilateral B-pattern in 101 patients (77%), B-pattern with subpleural consolidations in 26 (19.8%) and lung consolidations in 2 (1.5%). LUSCOP Protocol was consistent with HRCT in correctly screening 130 out of the 131 COVID-19 pneumonia cases (99.2%). In one case COVID-19 pneumonia was excluded by both HRCT and lung US. LUSCOP protocol showed optimal sensitivity and can be proposed as a simple screening tool for COVID-19 pneumonia diagnosis in the context of outbreak burst areas where prompt isolation of suspected patients is crucial for patients' and operators' safety.","Dacrema, Alessandro; Silva, Matteo; Rovero, Luca; Vertemati, Valeria; Losi, Giulia; Piepoli, Massimo Francesco; Sacchi, Roberto; Mangiacotti, Marco; Nazerian, Peiman; Pagani, Laura; Tinelli, Valentina; Poggiali, Erika; Bastoni, Davide; Vercelli, Andrea; Magnacavallo, Andrea",Intern. emerg. med,423,7

We developed and applied a deep-learning method to yield quantitative measures of TDLU involution in normal breast tissue. We assessed the associations of these automated measures with breast cancer risk factors and risk. METHODS: We obtained eight quantitative measures from whole slide images (WSIs) from a benign breast disease (BBD) nested case-control study within the Nurses' Health Studies (287 breast cancer cases and 1083 controls). Qualitative assessments of TDLU involution were available for 177 cases and 857 controls. The associations between risk factors and quantitative measures among controls were assessed using analysis of covariance adjusting for age. The relationship between each measure and risk was evaluated using unconditional logistic regression, adjusting for the matching factors, BBD subtypes, parity, and menopausal status. Qualitative measures and breast cancer risk were evaluated accounting for matching factors and BBD subtypes. RESULTS: Menopausal status and parity were significantly associated with all eight measures; select TDLU measures were associated with BBD histological subtype, BMI, and birth index (p<0.05). No measure was correlated with body size at ages 5-10 years, age at menarche, age at first birth, or breastfeeding history (p>0.05). Neither quantitative nor qualitative measures were associated with breast cancer risk. CONCLUSIONS: Among Nurses' Health Studies women diagnosed with BBD, TDLU involution is not a biomarker of subsequent breast cancer. IMPACT: TDLU involution may not impact breast cancer risk as previously thought.","Kensler, Kevin H; Liu, Emily Z F; Wetstein, Suzanne C; Onken, Allison M; Luffman, Christina I; Baker, Gabrielle M; Collins, Laura C; Schnitt, Stuart J; Bret-Mounet, Vanessa C; Veta, Mitko; Pluim, Josien P W; Liu, Ying; Colditz, Graham A; Eliassen, A Heather; Hankinson, Susan E; Tamimi, Rulla M; Heng, Yujing J",Cancer epidemiol. biomark. prev,423,16

Following IV administration, RDV is rapidly distributed into cells and tissues and simultaneously metabolized into GS-441524 and GS-704277 in plasma. LC-MS/MS methods were validated for determination of the 3 analytes in human plasma that involved two key aspects to guarantee their precision, accuracy and robustness. First, instability issues of the analytes were overcome by diluted formic acid (FA) treatment of the plasma samples. Secondly, a separate injection for each analyte was performed with different ESI modes and organic gradients to achieve sensitivity and minimize carryover. Chromatographic separation was achieved on an Acquity UPLC HSS T3 column (2.1 × 50 mm, 1.8 µm) with a run time of 3.4 min. The calibration ranges were 4-4000, 2-2000, and 2-2000 ng/mL, respectively for RDV, GS-441524 and GS-704277. The intraday and interday precision (%CV) across validation runs at 3 QC levels for all 3 analytes was less than 6.6%, and the accuracy was within ±11.5%. The long-term storage stability in FA-treated plasma was established to be 392, 392 and 257 days at -70 °C, respectively for RDV, GS-441524 and GS-704277.

Accelerated aging, loss of epithelial progenitor cell function and/or numbers and cellular senescence are implicated in the pathogenies of IPF. OBJECTIVES: We sought to investigate the role of alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells cellular senescence in initiation and/or progression of pulmonary fibrosis and therapeutic potential of targeting senescence related pathways and senescent cells. METHODS: Epithelial cells of 9 control donor proximal and distal lung tissues and 11 IPF fibrotic lung tissues were profiled by single cell RNAseq to assesses the contribution of epithelial cells to the senescent cell fraction for IPF. A novel mouse model of conditional AT2 cell senescence was generated to study role of cellular senescence in pulmonary fibrosis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We show that alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells isolated from IPF lung tissue exhibit characteristic transcriptomic features of cellular senescence. We used conditional loss of Sin3a in adult mouse AT2 cells to initiate a program of p53-dependent cellular senescence, AT2 cell depletion, and spontaneous, progressive pulmonary fibrosis. We establish that senescence rather than loss of AT2 cells promotes progressive fibrosis and show that either genetic or pharmacologic interventions targeting p53 activation or senescence block fibrogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: Senescence of AT2 cells is sufficient to drive progressive pulmonary fibrosis. Early attenuation of senescence-related pathways and elimination of senescent cells are promising therapeutic approachs to prevent pulmonary fibrosis.","Yao, Changfu; Guan, Xiangrong; Carraro, Gianni; Parimon, Tanyalak; Liu, Xue; Huang, Guanling; Mulay, Apoorva; Soukiasian, Harmik J; David, Gregory; Weigt, Stephen S; Belperio, John A; Chen, Peter; Jiang, Dianhua; Noble, Paul W; Stripp, Barry R",,423,30

Hence, here, we examined the factors affecting the recovery of hepatic reserve. METHODS: We followed up 403 patients (male: 164, female: 239; genotype 1: 299, genotype 2: 104; median age: 69 years) for at least 3 years after they achieved SVR to DAA therapy. Of these patients, 75 (18.6%) had a history of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Biochemical tests were periodically performed, and the hepatic reserve was evaluated based on the albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade. We examined background factors such as age, biochemical test results, HCC occurrence and portosystemic shunt by computed tomography. RESULTS: At the start of treatment, the ALBI grades were grades 1, 2, and 3 in 241, 157, and 5 patients, respectively, and 3 years later, 117 of 162 (72%) patients with grade 2 or 3 improved to grade 1. Multivariate analysis identified the HCC occurrence after achievement of SVR (hazard ratio [HR]: 3.08, P<0.0138), male sex (HR: 3.45, P=0.0143), hemoglobin level of <11.5 g/dL (HR: 4.19, P=0.0157), the presence of a portosystemic shunt (HR: 3.07, P=0.0349), and alanine aminotransferase levels <45 U/L (HR: 2.67, P=0.0425) as factors inhibiting improvement to grade 1.

Recent studies have detected in them depression and anxiety symptoms and burnout syndrome, with personal and social conditions impacting their response capacity during the health emergency. Our aim was to generate recommendations for the promotion and protection of the mental health of health workers and teams in the first line of care in the health emergency due to COVID-19. METHODS: A rapid literature search was carried out in PubMed and Google Scholar, and an iterative expert consensus and through electronic consultation, with 13 participants from the areas of psychology, psychiatry and medicine; the grading of its strength and directionality was carried out according to the international standards of the Joanna Briggs Institute. RESULTS: Thirty-one recommendations were generated on self-care of health workers, community care among health teams, screening for alarm signs in mental health and for health institutions. CONCLUSIONS: The promotion and protection activities in mental health to face the health emergency generated by COVID-19 worldwide can include coordinated actions between workers, health teams and health institutions as part of a comprehensive, community care, co-responsible and sustained over time.","Cantor-Cruz, Francy; McDouall-Lombana, Jorge; Parra, Aldemar; Martin-Benito, Lucia; Paternina Quesada, Natalia; González-Giraldo, Constanza; Cárdenas Rodríguez, Martha Lucia; Castillo Gutiérrez, Ana María; Garzón-Lawton, Mario; Ronderos-Bernal, Camila; García Guarín, Bibiana; Acevedo-Peña, Juan Ramón; Gómez-Gómez, Olga Victoria; Yomayusa-González, Nancy",,423,1

The manner in which the EU as a whole reacted to such sudden and grave challenge is by no means indicative of its political and legal-constitutional substance, and, consequently, of its capacity to subsist in its present form or to develop further. The centrepiece of the Next Generation EU (NGEU) is the Recovery and Resilience Facility, which should help Member States address the economic and social impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The establishment of the pandemic recovery fund may be regarded not only as an ad hoc measure, but also as a crucial milestone in the path to overcoming the disbalance between Union solidarity and national interests. However, the whole EU budget deal depended on the acceptance of the Rule of Law Mechanism by all Member States. In the first part, this paper will analyse the COVID-19 recovery fund compromise solution as it has been finally agreed. Firstly, we will try to determine the effectiveness of the conditionality mechanism, in the light of European Council Conclusions on the ""interpretative declaration on the new Rule of Law Mechanism"" and its legal effects. Secondly, we will tackle the issue of the enforcement of the Rule of Law protection mechanism, having in mind the causal link that should be detected, between the protection of the financial interests of the EU, with the non-respect of the EU values enshrined in the Article 2 TEU, by particular Member State(s). Consequently, we will try to envisage the impact of the implementation of this conditionality mechanism, taking into consideration which Member States, and EU citizens, would be ""hit"" hardest by it. In the second part of the paper an attempt shall be made to perceive the conditionality mechanism, tied to the recovery fund, from the perspective of the principle of solidarity. Ultimately, this paper will try to answer the following question: in view of the necessary shift of priorities and the need for urgent reaction to the COVID-19 crisis, is the common European answer, in view of the core values of the EU and the principle of solidarity, optimal, and above all, will it be effective?","Radovic, M.

From that moment it has quickly spread around the whole world. It causes COVID-19 disease manifested by breathlessness, coughing and high temperature. The COVID-19 pandemic has become a great challenge for humanity. The aim: To analyze interventions of emergency medical teams during the SAR-CoV-2 pandemic, and to compare obtained data with the same periods in 2018-2019. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Material and methods: The study retrospectively analyzed interventions of emergency medical teams in the period from 15.03 to 15.05 in 2018 - 2020. 1,479,530 interventions of emergency medical teams were included in the study. The number of interventions, reasons for calls, and diagnoses made by heads of the emergency medical teams during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic were compared to the same period in 2018-2019. RESULTS: Results: Authors observed the decline in the number of interventions performed by emergency medical teams during the pandemic in relation to earlier years by approximately 25%. The big decline concerned interventions that were the reason for calls to public places, such as ""traffic accident"" and ""collapse"". In the case of diagnoses made by the head of the emergency medical team, the diagnoses regarding stroke or sudden cardiac arrest remained at the similar level. Others showed a marked decline. CONCLUSION: Conclusions: Reduced social activity contributed to a reduced number of interventions by emergency medical teams in public places. The societal fear of the unknown also contributed to the decrease in the number of interventions performed by emergency medical teams. People began to avoid contact with other people.","Kucap, Michal; Nadolny, Klaudiusz; Ladny, Jerzy R; Zysko, Dorota; Galazkowski, Robert; Gasior, Mariusz; Kraska, Waldemar",Wiad Lek,423,20

METHODS: We queried the electronic medical record system for an integrated health system of 10 hospitals in the Chicago metropolitan area to identify cases of COVID-19. Comorbidities and outcomes were ascertained by ICD-10-CM coding and medical record data. We evaluated the risk for COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalization, and respiratory failure associated with OSA by univariate tests and logistic regression, adjusting for diabetes, hypertension, and BMI to account for potential confounding in the association between OSA, COVID-19 hospitalization, and progression to respiratory failure. RESULTS: We identified 9405 COVID-19 infections, among which 3185 (34%) were hospitalized and 1779 (19%) were diagnosed with respiratory failure. OSA was more prevalent among patients requiring hospitalization than those who did not (15.3% versus 3.4%, p < 0.0001; OR 5.20, 95% CI (4.43, 6.12)), and among those who progressed to respiratory failure (19.4% versus 4.5%, p < 0.0001; OR 5.16, 95% CI (4.41, 6.03)). After adjustment for diabetes, hypertension, and BMI, OSA was associated with increased risk for hospitalization (OR 1.65; 95% CI (1.36, 2.02)) and respiratory failure (OR 1.98; 95% CI (1.65, 2.37)). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with OSA experienced approximately 8-fold greater risk for COVID-19 infection compared to a similar age population receiving care in a large, racially, and socioeconomically diverse healthcare system. Among patients with COVID-19 infection, OSA was associated with increased risk of hospitalization and approximately double the risk of developing respiratory failure.","Maas, Matthew B; Kim, Minjee; Malkani, Roneil G; Abbott, Sabra M; Zee, Phyllis C",Sleep breath,423,16

Associated surveillance of S. aureus transmission quantifies the effectiveness of the basic measures to prevent the transmission to patients and clinicians of pathogenic bacteria and viruses, including Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). To measure transmission, the observational units are pairs of successive surgical cases in the same operating room on the same day. We evaluated appropriate sample sizes and strategies for measuring transmission. There was absence of serial correlation among observed counts of transmitted isolates within each of several periods (all P &#8805;.18). Similarly, observing transmission within or between cases of a pair did not increase the probability that the next sampled pair of cases also had observed transmission (all P &#8805;.23). Most pairs of cases had no detected transmitted isolates. Also, although transmission (yes/no) was associated with surgical site infection (P =.004), among cases with transmission, there was no detected dose response between counts of transmitted isolates and probability of infection (P =.25). The first of a fixed series of tests is to use the binomial test to compare the proportion of pairs of cases with S. aureus transmission to an acceptable threshold. An appropriate sample size for this screening is N =25 pairs. If significant, more samples are obtained while additional measures are implemented to reduce transmission and infections. Subsequent sampling is done to evaluate effectiveness. The two independent binomial proportions are compared using Boschloo's exact test. The total sample size for the 1st and 2nd stage is N =100 pairs. Because S. aureus transmission is invisible without testing, when choosing what population(s) to screen for surveillance, another endpoint needs to be used (e.g., infections). Only 10/298 combinations of specialty and operating room were relatively common (&#8805;1.0% of cases) and had expected incidence &#8805;0.20 infections per 8 hours of sampled cases. The 10 combinations encompassed â 17% of cases, showing the value of targeting surveillance of transmission to a few combinations of specialties and rooms. In conclusion, we created a sampling protocol and appropriate sample sizes for using S. aureus transmission within and between pairs of successive cases in the same operating room, the purpose being to monitor the quality of prevention of intraoperative spread of pathogenic bacteria and viruses.","Dexter, Franklin; Ledolter, Johannes; Wall, Russell T; Datta, Subhradeep; Loftus, Randy W",Perioper Care Oper Room Manag,423,1

Emerging data from China and Europe have consistently shown an increased incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE). We aimed to identify the VTE incidence and early predictors of VTE at our high-volume tertiary care center. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 147 patients who had been admitted to Temple University Hospital with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from April 1, 2020 to April 27, 2020. We first identified the VTE (pulmonary embolism [PE] and deep vein thrombosis [DVT]) incidence in our cohort. The VTE and no-VTE groups were compared by univariable analysis for demographics, comorbidities, laboratory data, and treatment outcomes. Subsequently, multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the early predictors of VTE. RESULTS: The 147 patients (20.9% of all admissions) admitted to a designated COVID-19 unit at Temple University Hospital with a high clinical suspicion of acute VTE had undergone testing for VTE using computed tomography pulmonary angiography and/or extremity venous duplex ultrasonography. The overall incidence of VTE was 17% (25 of 147). Of the 25 patients, 16 had had acute PE, 14 had had acute DVT, and 5 had had both PE and DVT. The need for invasive mechanical ventilation (adjusted odds ratio, 3.19; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-9.55) and the admission D-dimer level &#8805;1500 ng/mL (adjusted odds ratio, 3.55; 95% confidence interval, 1.29-9.78) were independent markers associated with VTE. The all-cause mortality in the VTE group was greater than that in the non-VTE group (48% vs 22%; P = .007). CONCLUSION: Our study represents one of the earliest reported from the United States on the incidence rate of VTE in patients with COVID-19. Patients with a high clinical suspicion and the identified risk factors (invasive mechanical ventilation, admission D-dimer level &#8805;1500 ng/mL) should be considered for early VTE testing. We did not screen all patients admitted for VTE; therefore, the true incidence of VTE could have been underestimated. Our findings require confirmation in future prospective studies.","Rali, Parth; O039,; Corragain, Oisin; Oresanya, Lawrence; Yu, Daohai; Sheriff, Omar; Weiss, Robert; Myers, Catherine; Desai, Parag; Ali, Nadia; Stack, Anthony; Bromberg, Michael; Lubitz, Andrea L; Panaro, Joseph; Bashir, Riyaz; Lakhter, Vladimir; Caricchio, Roberto; Gupta, Rohit; Dass, Chandra; Maruti, Kumaran; Lu, Xiaoning; Rao, A Koneti; Cohen, Gary; Criner, Gerard J; Choi, Eric T",J.

OBJECTIVES: To analyze the short-term effects of N95 respirators and medical masks, respectively, on skin physiological properties and to report adverse skin reactions caused by the protective equipment. METHODS: This study used a randomized crossover design with repeated measurements. Twenty healthy Chinese volunteers were recruited. Skin parameters were measured on areas covered by the respective masks and on uncovered skin 2 and 4 hours after donning, and 0.5 and 1 hour after removing the masks, including skin hydration, transepidermal water loss (TEWL), erythema, pH, and sebum secretion. Adverse reactions were clinically assessed, and perceived discomfort and non-compliance measured. RESULTS: Skin hydration, TEWL, and pH increased significantly with wearing the protective equipment. Erythema values increased from baseline. Sebum secretion increased both on the covered and uncovered skin with equipment-wearing. There was no significant difference in physiological values between the two types of equipment. More adverse reactions were reported following a N95 mask use than the use of a medical mask, with a higher score of discomfort and non-compliance.

The conformation equilibrium between open (up) and closed (down) conformations of receptor binding domain (RBD) is studied from the first-principle. The free energy change in conformation transition of S protein is introduced and we demonstrated that it includes two parts, one from the difference of conformation potential and another from the variation of structural elasticity. The latter is dependent of amino acid mutation. When the amino acid mutation of S protein causes a substantial reduction of elastic energy the equilibrium is biased to the open conformation. Only then can the virus infection process continue. That both the D614G mutation and the K986P mutation increase the COVID-19 infectivity and why a large number of mutations, including those at interface residues, have not been selected in current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic are interpreted from the presented theory. The evolution of coronavirus dependent on the alteration of conformation equilibrium is indicated. Finally, introduction of electric field to change the conformation potential barrier and how the conformation equilibrium depends on temperature and humidity are briefly discussed.","Luo, Liaofu; Zuo, Yongchun",,423,26

As the number of cases increased, the demand for tests multiplied, leading the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to use the Emergency Utilization Authorization to allow clinical and commercial laboratories to develop tests to detect the presence of the virus. Many nucleic acid tests based on RT-PCR were developed, each with different techniques, specifications, and turnaround time. As the illnesses turned into a pandemic, testing became more crucial. The test supply became inadequate to meet the need and so it had to be prioritized according to guidance. For surveillance, the need for serologic tests emerged. Here, we review the timeline of test development, the turnaround times, and the various approved tests, and compare them as regards the genes they detect. We concentrate on the point-of-care tests and discuss the basis for new serologic tests.

We reveal that, in normoxia, enzymatic action of cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) produces H2S, which persulfidates prolyl hydroxylase 2 (PHD2) at residues Cys21 and Cys33 (zinc finger motif), augmenting prolyl hydroxylase activity. Depleting endogenous H2S either by hypoxia or by inhibiting CBS via chemical or genetic means reduces persulfidation of PHD2 and inhibits activity, preventing hydroxylation of HIF-1&#945;, resulting in stabilization. Our in vitro findings are further supported by the depletion of CBS in the zebrafish model that exhibits axis defects and abnormal intersegmental vessels. Exogenous H2S supplementation rescues both in vitro and in vivo phenotypes. We have identified the persulfidated residues and defined their functional significance in regulating the activity of PHD2 via point mutations. Thus, the CBS/H2S/PHD2 axis may provide therapeutic opportunities for pathologies associated with HIF-1&#945; dysregulation in chronic diseases.","Dey, Anindya; Prabhudesai, Shubhangi; Zhang, Yushan; Rao, Geeta; Thirugnanam, Karthikeyan; Hossen, Md Nazir; Dwivedi, Shailendra Kumar Dhar; Ramchandran, Ramani; Mukherjee, Priyabrata; Bhattacharya, Resham",Sci.

This study explored the experiences and support needs of children and young adults (CYAs) with CF, and parents who have a child with CF, during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: CYAs with CF and parents of CYAs with CF completed a UK wide online survey with open and closed questions exploring experiences, information and support needs and decision-making processes. Qualitative thematic content analysis and descriptive quantitative analyses were undertaken. RESULTS: CYAs aged 10-30 years (n = 99) and parents of CYAs aged 0-34 years (n = 145) responded. Parents (72.7%) and CYAs (50.0%) worried about the virus, and both were vigilant for virus symptoms (82.7% and 79.7%). Over three-quarters of CYAs were worried about their own health if they caught the virus. CYAs worried about feeling more isolated during the virus (64.9%). Qualitative findings reported the following themes: (1) Disruption-caused by isolation, (2) impact on psychological wellbeing, (3) safety of shielding, and (4) healthcare and treatment provision-changes to care, access and support. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of COVID-19 and UK shielding advice to have no contact with anyone outside the household caused disruption to the lives and routines of individuals in relation to work, education, social lives, relationships, CF management routines and support. Parents and CYAs highlighted the need for clear, up-to-date and tailored advice on individualized risks and shielding.","Collaço, Nicole; Legg, Julian; Day, Maria; Culliford, David; Campion, Anna; West, Carolyn; Darlington, Anne-Sophie",Pediatr. pulmonol,423,16

To compare the effectiveness of a novel genetically engineered recombinant super-compound interferon (rSIFN-co) with traditional interferon-alpha added to baseline antiviral agents (lopinavir-ritonavir or umifenovir) for the treatment of moderate-to-severe COVID-19. METHOD: In this multicenter randomized (1:1) trial, patients hospitalized with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 received either rSIFN-co nebulization or interferon-alpha nebulization added to baseline antiviral agents for no more than 28 days. The primary endpoint was the time to clinical improvement. Secondary endpoints included the overall rate of clinical improvement assessed on day 28, the time to radiological improvement and virus nucleic acid negative conversion. RESULTS: A total of 94 patients were included in the safety set (46 patients assigned to rSIFN-co group, 48 to interferon-alpha group). The time to clinical improvement was 11.5 days versus 14.0 days (95% CI 1.10 to 2.81, p = .019); the overall rate of clinical improvement on day 28 was 93.5% versus 77.1% (difference, 16.4%; 95% CI 3% to 30%); the time to radiological improvement was 8.0 days versus 10.0 days (p = .002), the time to virus nucleic acid negative conversion was 7.0 days versus 10.0 days (p = .018) in the rSIFN-co and interferon alpha arms, respectively. Adverse events were balanced with no deaths among groups. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: rSIFN-co was associated with a shorter time of clinical improvement than traditional interferon-alpha in the treatment of moderate-to-severe COVID-19 when combined with baseline antiviral agents. rSIFN-co therapy alone or combined with other antiviral therapy is worth to be further studied.Key messagesThere are few effective therapies for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) upon the outbreak of the pandemic. Interferon alphas, by inducing both innate and adaptive immune responses, have shown clinical efficacy in treating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus.In this multicenter, head-to-head, randomized, clinical trial which included 94 participants with moderate-to-severe COVID-19, the rSIFN-co plus antiviral agents (lopinavir-ritonavir or umifenovir) was associated with a shorter time of clinical improvement than interferon-alpha plus antiviral agents.","Li, Chuan; Luo, Fengming; Liu, Chengwu; Xiong, Nian; Xu, Zhihua; Zhang, Wei; Yang, Ming; Wang, Ye; Liu, Dan; Yu, Chao; Zeng, Jia; Zhang, Li; Li, Duo; Liu, Yanbin; Feng, Mei; Liu, Ruoyang; Mei, Jiandong; Deng, Senyi; Zeng, Zhen; He, Yuanhong; Liu, Haiyan; Shi, Zhengyu; Duan, Meng; Kang, Deying; Liao, Jiayu; Li, Weimin; Liu, Lunxu",Ann Med,423,12

Objective: To make an overview of the situation at the primary and hospital health care level with the aim of assessing the existing human resources and capacity of health care institutions in FB&H, with which we entered in COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This retrospective study presents the efficiency of health care in FB&H measured by number of medical doctors, and other medical staff during the time period of five years. Data of the Institute for Public Health FB&H were used. The Institute for Public Health FB&H is authorised by the law to conduct and implement statistical research in the field of health care in line with relevant laws and by-laws. The Institute is obliged to report on organisational structure, human resources and medical equipment. Results: Presented data include the number of health care employees in medical institutions in FB&H in the period 2015-2019 per 100,000 inhabitants and their numbers in primary health care, family medicine, secondary and tertiary level of health care in 2019.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: All imaging departments in the UK were contacted and asked about the provision of home reporting and IT support before and after the first wave of the pandemic. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-seven of the 217 departments contacted replied, producing a response rate of 61%. There was a 147% increase in the provision of remote access viewing and reporting platforms during the pandemic. Although 578 consultants had access to a viewing platform pre-pandemic, this had increased to 1,431 during the course of the first wave. CONCLUSION: This survey represents work undertaken by UK NHS Trusts in co-ordinating and providing increased home-reporting facilities to UK radiologists during the first wave of this global pandemic. The impact of these facilities has been shown to allow more than just the provision of reporting of both elective and emergency imaging and provides additional flexibility in how UK radiologists can help support and provide services.

For many, the guidance has led to new ways of working, most notably a shift towards working remotely. While eye care practitioners (ECPs) may continue to provide urgent or emergency eye care, in many cases the travel restrictions present a unique challenge by preventing conventional face-to-face examination. Telephone triage provides a useful starting point for establishing at-risk and emergency patients; but patient examination is central to contact lens patient care. The indeterminate period over which conventional practice will be suspended, and the risk that resumption of 'normal' practice could be impeded by a potential secondary peak in COVID-19 cases, hastens the need for practitioners to adapt their delivery of eyecare. Specifically, it is prudent to reflect upon supportive evidence for more comprehensive approaches to teleoptometry in contact lens practice. Smartphone based ocular imaging is an area which has seen considerable growth, particularly for imaging the posterior eye. Smartphone imaging of the anterior eye requires additional specialised instrumentation unlikely to be available to patients at home. Further, there is only limited evidence for self-administered image capture. In general, digital photographs, are useful for detection of gross anterior eye changes, but subtle changes are less discernible. For the assessment of visual acuity, many electronic test charts have been validated for use by practitioners. Research into self-administered visual acuity measures remains limited. The absence of a comprehensive evidence base for teleoptometry limits ECPs, particularly during this pandemic. Knowledge gaps ought to be addressed to facilitate development of optometry specific evidence-based guidance for telecare. In particular, advances in ocular self-imaging could help move this field forwards.","Nagra, Manbir; Vianya-Estopa, Marta; Wolffsohn, James S",Cont Lens Anterior Eye,423,32

This posed challenges to many countries, prominent among which is communication with the public to gain their cooperation. Israel faces different challenges from other countries in its management of the COVID-19 crisis because it is in the midst of a deep constitutional crisis. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper was to examine the response of the Israeli public to the government's emergency instructions regarding the pandemic in terms of correlations between overall risk perception and crisis management; overall risk perception and economic threat perception; crisis management and compliance with behavioral guidelines; and crisis management and economic threat perception. We also made comparisons between crisis management and spokesperson credibility and between crisis management and the credibility of information sources. METHODS: The sample was established using an online survey that enabled rapid and effective distribution of an online questionnaire during the COVID-19 crisis. The self-selection online survey method of nonprobability sampling was used to recruit participants (N=1056) through social network posts asking the general public (aged &#8805;18 years) to answer the survey. RESULTS: Participants aged &#8805;65 years perceived higher personal risk compared to those aged 18-30 years (mean difference 0.33, 95% CI 0.04-0.61) and those aged 46-64 years (mean difference 0.38, 95% CI 0.12-0.64). Significant correlations were found between overall risk perception and attitudes toward crisis management (r=0.19, P<.001), overall risk perception and economic threat perception (r=0.22, P<.001), attitudes toward crisis management and compliance with behavioral guidelines (r=0.15, P<.001), and attitudes toward crisis management and economic threat perception (r=-0.15, P<.001). Participants who perceived that the prime minister was the most credible spokesperson evaluated the crisis management significantly higher than all other groups. The crisis management was evaluated significantly lower by participants who stated that infectious disease specialists were the most credible spokespersons. Participants for whom the Ministry of Health website was the most credible source of information evaluated the crisis management higher than all other groups. Participants for whom scientific articles were the most credible source of information evaluated the crisis management lower than those who perceived that the WHO/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention websites or Ministry of Health/hospital websites and health care workers were the most credible. CONCLUSIONS: The higher the public trust and evaluation of crisis management, the greater the compliance of the public with guidelines. It was also found that crisis management and information cannot be approached in the same way for the overall public. Furthermore, unlike other epidemics, the COVID-19 crisis has widespread economic and social consequences; therefore, it is impossible to focus only on health risks without communicating economic and social risks as well.","Gesser-Edelsburg, Anat; Cohen, Ricky; Hijazi, Rana; Abed Elhadi Shahbari, Nour",J Med Internet Res,423,29

Doppler ultrasonography revealed occlusion of the right brachial and right common carotid artery. Subsequently, computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed the occlusion of the right brachial and common carotid artery, and revealed pedunculated floating ascending aortic mass. The floating thrombus in ascending aorta is a rare and potentially very dangerous pathological condition. Although aetiology is still unclear, ascending aorta atherosclerosis and coagulation disorder are probably the most common reasons. Hypercoagulable state, high level of antiphospholipid antibody and factor VIII are closely relating with vascular thrombosis. Since the outbreak of the coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, increasing evidence suggests that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) might produce hypercoagulable state with subsequent thrombosis and thromboembolism. The infection elevated the level of factor VIII in the blood and, consequently, increased the risk of adverse thrombotic and embolic events. Additionally, endothelial inflammation and injury mediated by coronavirus represent an additional risk factor. According to literature, this is the first case of the floating ascending aorta thrombus in the patient with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The thrombus' fragile structure and high blood velocity through the ascending aorta significantly increases cerebral and peripheral embolization incidence, with potentially fatal outcome. Due to frequent adverse events, urgent surgical extirpation is the best therapy option. We presented successfully surgically treated giant floating thrombus in the ascending aorta and aortic arch in a patient with recent SARS-CoV-2 infection with acute right arm ischemia due to embolic complication.","Zivkovic, I.; Milacic, P.; Mihajlovic, V.; Krasic, S.; Lesanovic, J.; Peric, M.; Zdravkovic, D.",Cardiovascular Diagnosis &amp; Therapy,423,1

DESIGN: Outbreak investigation. SETTING: University-affiliated tertiary-care referral center. PATIENTS: Operating room staff with positive SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing. METHODS: Epidemiologic and environmental investigations were conducted including contact tracing, environmental surveys, and sampling and review of the operating room schedule for staff-to-staff, staff-to-patient, and patient-to-staff SARS-CoV-2 transmission. RESULTS: In total, 24 healthcare personnel (HCP) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, including nurses (29%), surgical technologists (25%), and surgical residents (16%). Moreover, 19 HCP (79%) reported having used a communal area, most commonly break rooms (75%). Overall, 20 HCP (83%) reported symptomatic disease. In total, 72 environmental samples were collected from communal areas for SARS-CoV-2 genomic testing; none was positive. Furthermore, 236 surgical cases were reviewed for transmission: 213 (90%) had negative preoperative SARS-CoV-2 testing, 21 (9%) had a positive test on or before the date of surgery, and 2 (<1%) did not have a preoperative test performed. In addition, 40 patients underwent postoperative testing (mean, 13 days to postoperative testing), and 2 returned positive results. Neither of these 2 cases was linked to our outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: Complacency in infection control practices among staff during peak community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is believed to have driven staff-to-staff transmission. Prompt identification of the outbreak led to rapid interventions, ultimately allowing for uninterrupted surgical service.","McDougal, April N; Elhassani, Dana; DeMaet, Mary Ann; Shores, Shirley; Plante, Kenneth S; Plante, Jessica A; Pyles, Richard; Weaver, Scott C; Williams-Bouyer, Natalie; Tyler, Brenda J; Davis, Hollie R; Patel, Janak",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,423,16

Emerging evidence suggests that the composition of the gut microbiome and modification of microbial ecology via probiotics can affect susceptibility to a wide range of infections, including respiratory tract infections. In this study, we aim to evaluate the effects of the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) versus placebo on COVID-19 infection status and the gut microbiome in subjects with a household contact who has tested positive for COVID-19. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In this double-blinded, randomised, placebo-controlled trial, we will randomise 1132 subjects having a household contact who has recently (&#8804;7 days) tested positive for COVID-19 to daily oral LGG or placebo for 28 days. We hypothesise that taking LGG as a probiotic will protect against COVID-19 infection and reduce the severity of disease in those who become infected (primary endpoint: decreased symptoms), and will be associated with beneficial changes in the composition of the gut microbiome. Stool samples and nasal swabs will be collected to evaluate the microbiome by 16S rRNA sequencing and the presence of SARS-CoV-2 by PCR, respectively. We will also conduct multivariate analysis of demographic, behavioural, temporal, and other variables that may predict development of symptoms and other outcomes. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This trial is conducted under a Food and Drug Administration Investigational New Drug for LGG, has received ethics approval by the institutional review board of Duke University and enrolment has begun. We plan to disseminate the results in peer-reviewed journals and at national and international conferences.

SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, induces both specific T- and B-cell responses, being antibodies against the virus detected a few days after infection. Passive immunization with hyperimmune plasma from convalescent patients has been proposed as a potentially useful treatment for COVID-19. Using an in-house quantitative ELISA test, we found that plasma from 177 convalescent donors contained IgG antibodies specific to the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2, although at very different concentrations which correlated with previous disease severity and gender. Anti-RBD IgG plasma concentrations significantly correlated with the plasma viral neutralizing activity (VN) against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Similar results were found using an independent cohort of serum from 168 convalescent health workers. These results validate an in-house RBD IgG ELISA test in a large cohort of COVID-19 convalescent patients and indicate that plasma from all convalescent donors does not contain a high enough amount of anti-SARS-CoV-2-RBD neutralizing IgG to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. The use of quantitative anti-RBD IgG detection systems might help to predict the efficacy of the passive immunization using plasma from patients recovered from SARS-CoV-2.","Santiago, Llipsy; Uranga-Murillo, Iratxe; Arias, Maykel; González-Ramírez, Andrés Manuel; Macías-León, Javier; Moreo, Eduardo; Redrado, Sergio; García-García, Ana; Taleb, Víctor; Lira-Navarrete, Erandi; Hurtado-Guerrero, Ramón; Aguilo, Nacho; Del Mar Encabo-Berzosa, Maria; Hidalgo, Sandra; Galvez, Eva M; Ramirez-Labrada, Ariel; de Miguel, Diego; Benito, Rafael; Miranda, Patricia; Fernández, Antonio; Domingo, José María; Serrano, Laura; Yuste, Cristina; Villanueva-Saz, Sergio; Paño-Pardo, José Ramón; Pardo, Julián",,423,21

Methods and Results In a propensity score-matched outpatient cohort (January - May 2020) of 2,263 Medicare Advantage and commercially insured individuals with hypertension and a positive outpatient SARS-CoV-2 test, we determined the association of ACE inhibitors and ARBs with COVID-19 hospitalization. In a concurrent inpatient cohort of 7,933 hospitalized with COVID-19, we tested their association with in-hospital mortality. The robustness of the observations was assessed in a contemporary cohort (May - August). In the outpatient study, neither ACE inhibitors (HR, 0.77, 0.53-1.13, P=0.18), nor ARBs (HR, 0.88, 0.61-1.26, P=0.48), were associated with hospitalization risk. ACE inhibitors were associated with lower hospitalization risk in the older Medicare group (HR, 0.61, 0.41-0.93, P=0.02), but not the younger commercially insured group (HR, 2.14, 0.82-5.60, P=0.12; P-interaction 0.09). Neither ACE inhibitors nor ARBs were associated with lower hospitalization risk in either population in the validation cohort. In the primary inpatient study cohort, neither ACE inhibitors (0.97, 0.81-1.16; P=0.74) nor ARBs (1.15, 0.95-1.38, P=0.15) were associated with in-hospital mortality. These observations were consistent in the validation cohort. Conclusions ACE inhibitors and ARBs were not associated with COVID-19 hospitalization or mortality. Despite early evidence for a potential association between ACE inhibitors and severe COVID-19 prevention in older individuals, the inconsistency of this observation in recent data argues against a role for prophylaxis.","Khera, Rohan; Clark, Callahan; Lu, Yuan; Guo, Yinglong; Ren, Sheng; Truax, Brandon; Spatz, Erica S; Murugiah, Karthik; Lin, Zhenqiu; Omer, Saad B; Vojta, Deneen; Krumholz, Harlan M",J Am Heart Assoc,423,16

It menacingly affects not only public health and global economics but also mental health and mood. While the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been widely studied, relatively fewer discussions about the sentimental reaction of the population have been available. In this article, we scrape COVID-19 related tweets on the microblogging platform, Twitter, and examine the tweets from Feb~24, 2020 to Oct~14, 2020 in four Canadian cities (Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, and Calgary) and four U.S. cities (New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Seattle). Applying the Vader and NRC approaches, we evaluate the sentiment intensity scores and visualize the information over different periods of the pandemic. Sentiment scores for the tweets concerning three anti-epidemic measures, masks, vaccine, and lockdown, are computed for comparisons. The results of four Canadian cities are compared with four cities in the United States. We study the causal relationships between the infected cases, the tweet activities, and the sentiment scores of COVID-19 related tweets, by integrating the echo state network method with convergent cross-mapping. Our analysis shows that public sentiments regarding COVID-19 vary in different time periods and locations. In general, people have a positive mood about COVID-19 and masks, but negative in the topics of vaccine and lockdown. The causal inference shows that the sentiment influences people's activities on Twitter, which is also correlated to the daily number of infections.","Zhang, Qihuang; Yi, Grace Y.; Chen, Li-Pang; He, Wenqing",,423,16

Both assays showed high within-run and within-laboratory precision (coefficients of variation < 11.0%) and very low cross-reactivity towards sera of patients with a past common coronavirus or respiratory virus infection. Clinical specificity determined on up to 989 pre-pandemic healthy donors was &#8805; 99% with a narrow 95% confidence interval for both IgM and IgG assays. Clinical sensitivity was determined on up to 232 samples from 130 RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients.

Combined IgM/IgG test results improved the PPA compared to each test alone. SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroconversion followed closely that of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and remained stable over time, while SARS-CoV-2 IgM levels rapidly declined. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG responses were significantly higher in COVID-19 hospitalized vs. non-hospitalized patients. Altogether, the VIDAS® SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG assays are highly specific and sensitive serological tests suitable for the reliable detection of past acute SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Renard, Nathalie; Daniel, Soizic; Cayet, Nadège; Pecquet, Matthieu; Raymond, Frédérique; Pons, Sylvie; Lupo, Julien; Tourneur, Carole; Pretis, Catherine; Gerez, Guillaume; Blasco, Patrick; Combe, Maxime; Canova, Imen; Lesénéchal, Mylène; Berthier, Franck",J. clin. microbiol,423,26

RESEARCH QUESTION: What is the incidence of TC in critically ill patients with COVID-19 and what is the relationship between the dose of anticoagulant therapy and the incidence of TC? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: All consecutive patients referred to eight French intensive care units (ICU) for COVID-19 were included in our observational study. Clinical and laboratory data were collected from ICU admission to day 14, including anticoagulation status and thrombotic and hemorrhagic events. The effect of high dose prophylactic anticoagulation (either at intermediate or equivalent to therapeutic dose), defined using a standardized protocol of classification, was assessed using a time-varying exposure model using inverse probability of treatment weight. RESULTS: Out of 538 patients included, 104 patients developed a total of 122 TC with an incidence of 22.7 % (19.2-26.3). Pulmonary embolism accounted for 52 % of the recorded TC. High dose prophylactic anticoagulation was associated with a significant reduced risk of TC (HR 0.81 [0.66-0.99]) without increasing the risk of bleeding (HR 1.11 [0.70-1.75]). INTERPRETATION: High dose prophylactic anticoagulation is associated with a reduction in thrombotic complications in critically ill COVID-19 patients without an increased risk of hemorrhage.

Stakeholders, governments, and national authorities have mounted responses to contain the pandemic. This study aimed to catalogue the risk communication and community engagement (RCCE) strategies as well as the challenges facing RCCE in 13 African countries. Methods: We conducted a narrative review of evidence to answer the aim of the study. The search was conducted in March 2021 and evidence published between December 2019 and February 2021 were included. Data reported in this article were obtained from reports, literature in peer-reviewed journals, grey literature and other data sources in 13 African countries. The 13 countries include Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Algeria, Angola, Cote d'Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mauritius, Nigeria, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia. The authors also snowball further data to gather information for this review. Results: Most of the priority African countries have RCCE strategies to contain the transmission and spread of the coronavirus. Our findings revealed RCCE strategies in the 13 African countries focused on training and capacity building, risk communication systems, internal and partners' coordination, community engagement, public communication, contending uncertainty, addressing misperceptions and managing misinformation. However, the RCCE response activities were not without challenges, which included distrust in government, cultural, social, and religious resistance, and inertia among others. Conclusion: With the similar RCCE approaches and interventions seen across the countries, it is clear that countries are learning from each other and from global health organizations to develop COVID-19 RCCE programs. It is important for African countries to address the challenges facing RCCE in order to effectively contain the pandemic and to prepare for future public health emergencies.","Adebisi, Y.

Before lockdown peak was examined in end of May 2020 but post lockdown, it is expected to arrive in mid-August 2020. Thus lockdown measures has delayed the arrival of peak of epidemic which would be helpful in preparing the healthcare system in advance, to tackle worst situation if arises in future.","Youkta, Kumari; Paramanik, Rajendra Narayan",J Public Aff,423,20

Small molecules targeting this assembly are being investigated as drug candidates to contrast SARS-CoV-2. In this context, chloroquine, an antimalarial agent proposed as a repurposed drug to treat coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), was hypothesized to bind RBD among its other mechanisms. Similarly, artemisinin and its derivatives are being studied as potential antiviral agents. In this work, we investigated the interaction of artemisinin, its metabolite dihydroartemisinin and chloroquine with RBD by means of computational tools and in vitro. Docking studies showed that the compounds interfere with the same region of the protein and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations demonstrated the stability of the predicted complexes. Bio-layer interferometry showed that chloroquine dose-dependently binds RBD (KD = 35.9 µM) more efficiently than artemisinins.","Ribaudo, Giovanni; Coghi, Paolo; Yang, Li Jun; Ng, Jerome P L; Mastinu, Andrea; Memo, Maurizio; Wong, Vincent Kam Wai; Gianoncelli, Alessandra",Nat Prod Res,423,24

The microblog texts related to an event were divided into seven emotional categories via multi-emotional analysis to capture the subtle emotions of netizens toward an event, i.e., public opinion. By detecting the characteristics of the text and regional coverage of emotions, an emotional coverage index that reflects the intensity of emotional impact was proposed to determine the mainstream emotion of netizens. By capturing the mutation characteristics of the impact intensity of mainstream emotions, the critical time window of the public opinion toward the event was obtained. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method can effectively identify the critical outbreak time window of controversial events, which can help authorities in preventing the further aggravation of events.","Wang, Mingyang; Wu, Huan; Zhang, Tianyu; Zhu, Shengqing",PLoS One,423,1

Major facilitator superfamily domain-containing 2a (Mfsd2a) is a specific marker of the BBB. However, the mechanism by which Mfsd2a influences the BBB is poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrated that Mfsd2a is essential for sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) export from endothelial cells in the brain. We found that Mfsd2a and Spinster homolog 2 (Spns2) form a protein complex to ensure the efficient transport of S1P. Furthermore, the S1P-rich microenvironment in the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the vascular endothelium dominates the formation and maintenance of the BBB. We demonstrated that different concentrations of S1P have different effects on BBB integrity. These findings help to unravel the mechanism by which S1P regulates BBB and also provide previously unidentified insights into the delivery of neurological drugs in the CNS.","Wang, Zhifu; Zheng, Yongtao; Wang, Fan; Zhong, Junjie; Zhao, Tong; Xie, Qiang; Zhu, Tongming; Ma, Fukai; Tang, Qisheng; Zhou, Bin; Zhu, Jianhong",Sci.

Genetically modified mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be used to treat critical and incurable retinal diseases. Here, we overexpressed PEDF in placenta-derived MSCs (PD-MSCsPEDF, PEDF+) using a nonviral gene delivery system and evaluated the characteristics of PD-MSCsPEDF and their potential regenerative effects on RPE cells damaged by H2O2-induced OS. PD-MSCsPEDF maintained their stemness, cell surface marker, and differentiation potential characteristics. Compared to naive cells, PD-MSCsPEDF promoted mitochondrial respiration by enhancing biogenesis regulators (e.g., NRF1, PPARGC1A, and TFAM) as well as antioxidant enzymes (e.g., HMOXs, SODs, and GPX1). Compared to OS-damaged RPE cells cocultured with naive cells, OS-damaged RPE cells cocultured with PD-MSCsPEDF showed PEDF upregulation and VEGF downregulation. The expression levels of antioxidant genes and RPE-specific genes, such as RPE65, RGR, and RRH, were significantly increased in RPE cells cocultured with PD-MSCsPEDF. Furthermore, OS-damaged RPE cells cocultured with PD-MSCsPEDF had dramatically enhanced mitochondrial functions, and antiapoptotic effects improved due to cell survival signaling pathways. In the H2O2-induced retinal degeneration rat model, compared to administration of the naive counterpart, intravitreal administration of PD-MSCsPEDF alleviated proinflammatory cytokines and restored retinal structure and function by increasing PEDF expression and decreasing VEGF expression. Intravitreal administration of PD-MSCsPEDF also protected retinal degeneration against OS by increasing antioxidant gene expression and regulating the mitochondrial ROS levels and biogenesis. Taken together, PEDF overexpression in PD-MSCs improved the mitochondrial activities and induced OS-damaged RPE cell regeneration by regulating the oxidative status and mitochondrial biogenesis in vitro and in vivo. These data suggest that genetic modification of PEDF in PD-MSCs might be a new cell therapy for the treatment of retinal degenerative diseases.","Kim, Jae Yeon; Park, Sohae; Park, So Hyun; Lee, Dongsook; Kim, Gyu Hyun; Noh, Jung Eun; Lee, Kea Joo; Kim, Gi Jin",Lab. invest,423,16

Data of surgical activity has been analysed.During the 9 weeks of lockdown the access of patients to ED drastically decreased: 11726 accesses compared to 21501 in the same period of 2019. This trend was followed by the most common skeletal injuries but not by proximal femur fracture (PFF) that showed the same absolute numbers compare to the previous years (64 vs 63). If analysed in relation to the total ED access, PFF showed a relatively increase in their frequency.The data from this experience suggest that healthcare providers should strategically allocate resources for management and treatment of PFF during the COVID-19 pandemic. With the begin of the reopening phase, a ""rebound effect"" for orthopaedic care was observed leading to delayed treatments with a potential overall increased morbidity.","Samaila, Elena Manuela; Negri, Stefano; Corzani, Marco; Zancan, Federico; Maluta, Tommaso; Magnan, Bruno",Acta Biomed,423,12

This is expected to have a negative impact on the global economy, especially on those countries that depend more on the revenue from sales of crude oil. One of the measures that can be taken to survive this kind of situation in the future is to reduce the unit technical cost for producing a barrel of oil by using locally available materials. This research investigated a local clay sourced from Ropp in Plateau State, Nigeria, by considering its rheological characteristics and economic implications of using it for partial to total substitution of imported bentonite clay for oil and gas drilling operations. The local clay was termed as Ropp bentonite clay (RBC). Various spud mud samples were prepared by dispersing a mixture of imported bentonite clay (IBC) and RBC (0-100%) in 350 ml of water. Certain quantity (0-1 g) of polyacrylamide cellulose was added to the mud samples before rheological and physical properties were determined using the standard API procedure. An economic model was built to determine the cost implications of using any of the mud formulations at different consumption rates. The results show that IBC-RBC blend in the right proportion could save Nigeria 12 to 36% of the cost of bentonite clay used to drill wells in the country.","Ogolo, Oghenerume; Arinkoola, Akeem; Osisanya, Samuel; Egede, Frank; Chior, Ternenge Joseph",J Pet Explor Prod Technol,423,24

Methods: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, The Cochrane Library, CNKI, WanFang and VIP from December 1, 2019 to December 31, 2020. The included studies were assessed using JBI critical appraisal tools and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The RP rate of discharge patients was analyzed by a meta-analysis. We adhered to PRISMA reporting guideline. Findings: We have included 117 studies with 2669 RP participants after discharge. The methodological quality of 66 case reports were low to high, 42 case series and 3 cohort study were moderate to high, 3 case-control studies were moderate and 3 cross-sectional studies were low to moderate. The clinical manifestations of most RP patients were mild or asymptomatic, and CT imaging and laboratory examinations were usually normal. The existing risk factors suggest that more attention should be paid to sever patients, elderly patients, and patients with co-morbidities.

Previous assessments of the transcriptome of in vitro potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) exposed to US transmitted through air (AB-US) or liquid (PE-US) revealed the up- or down-regulation of several stress-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to abiotic stress. In a bid to better characterize stress-related elements over a four-week period, the transcriptome of AB-US was compared to that of PE-US. When comparing the controls of both treatments, DEGs related to hypoxia were not detected. Nevertheless, hypoxia-related DEGs were detected in the combination of liquid medium and ultrasonication. DEGs coding for chitinase, peroxidase, glutathione-S-transferase, transcription factors of ERF (ethylene responsive factor), DREB (dehydration-responsive element-binding), WRKY and MYB were also significantly highly expressed in PE-US, relative to AB-US. Up- and down-regulation of DEGs related to metabolic processes, and enzymes of the antioxidant system also confirm that PE-US is a more acute abiotic stress than AB-US. KEY MESSAGE: A transcriptomic analysis revealed that liquid-based ultrasonication was a stronger abiotic stressor than air-based ultrasonication. Of particular interest were the heat shock proteins and transcription factors in this comparison. Despite the ultrasound stress, explants survived and plantlets developed.","Dobránszki, Judit; Hidvégi, Norbert; Gulyás, Andrea; Tóth, Bianka; Teixeira da Silva, Jaime A",Prog. biophys. mol. biol,423,21

It relies on the dynamic magnetic responses of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) for the detection of target analytes in liquid phase. There are many research studies reporting the application of MPS for detecting a variety of analytes including viruses, toxins, and nucleic acids, etc. Herein, we report a modified version of MPS platform with the addition of a one-stage lock-in design to remove the feedthrough signals induced by external driving magnetic fields, thus capturing only MNP responses for improved system sensitivity. This one-stage lock-in MPS system is able to detect as low as 781 ng multi-core Nanomag50 iron oxide MNPs (micromod Partikeltechnologie GmbH) and 78 ng single-core SHB30 iron oxide MNPs (Ocean NanoTech). In addition, using a streptavidin-biotin binding system as a proof-of-concept, we show that these single-core SHB30 MNPs can be used for Brownian relaxation-based bioassays while the multi-core Nanomag50 cannot be used. The effects of MNP amount on the concentration dependent response profiles for detecting streptavidin was also investigated. Results show that by using lower concentration/amount of MNPs, concentration-response curves shift to lower concentration/amount of target analytes. This lower concentrationresponse indicates the possibility of improved bioassay sensitivities by using lower amounts of MNPs.","Chugh, Vinit Kumar; Wu, Kai; Krishna, Venkatramana D.; Girolamo, Arturo di; Bloom, Robert P.; Wang, Yongqiang Andrew; Saha, Renata; Liang, Shuang; Cheeran, Maxim C-J; Wang, Jian-Ping",,423,16

The pandemic seems to have some epidemiological specificities in sub-Saharan Africa, and this may be reflected in the type and frequency of neurological symptoms. This study aimed to report neurological manifestations associated with symptomatic COVID-19 in a sub-Saharan African setting. Methods: we conducted a retrospective review of symptomatic PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases admitted to the Bafoussam Regional Hospital between March and September 2020. Patients' files were reviewed at discharge by a consultant neurologist. Socio-demographic characteristics, co-morbidities, symptoms on admission, neurological symptoms during hospitalization, management, and in-hospital outcome were recorded. Comparisons between patients with and without neurological symptoms were performed using Fisher's exact and Mann-Whitney U test. Results: we enrolled 177 symptomatic patients (68% men). Mean age was 54.6 ± 17.8 years (range 2-99 years). Co-morbidities were present in 57.6% of patients, including hypertension (27.1%) and diabetes mellitus (25.4%). Neurological symptoms were found in 113 (63.8%) patients. The most frequent were headache (39.0%), myalgia (35.6%), anosmia (11.9%), impaired consciousness (10.7%) and delirium (5.6%). Regarding the presenting symptoms, fever was more frequent in patients with neurological symptoms than in those without (81.4% versus 50.0%, p< 0.001), while digestive symptoms were less frequent in patients with neurological symptoms (0.9% versus 9.4%, p= 0.004). Conclusion: neurological manifestations are frequent and heterogeneous in patients with symptomatic COVID-19. Further studies are needed to clarify the pathophysiology of neurological symptoms in COVID-19 and their impact on patients' long-term outcome.","Fogang, Yannick Fogoum; Noubom, Michel; Bassong, Pierre-Yves; Mbonda, Paul Chimi; Mfopou, Iliassou Njoudap; Gams, Daniel Massi; Kuate, Callixte Tegueu; Kamtchum-Tatuene, Joseph",Pan Afr Med J,423,27

However, the energy efficiency of BWED cannot approach optimization because of the low salt concentration of BW. In this study, a novel two hydraulic-stage ED desalination system was presented to enhance mass transfer and reduce energy consumption. In terms of energy-efficient strategies, it involved not only innovative membrane stack configurations (resin-filled electrode cells and asymmetric cell pairs design) but also optimizing inflow modes (electrolytes parallel flow and dilute/concentrate counter flow). Results showed that thin resin-filled (1 mm) electrode cells, asymmetric cell pair design (cell pairs ratio of 1st and 2nd-hydraulic stages, 1.2), and optimizations of general inflow mode were beneficial for savings 10-30% of energy consumption at the same salt removal ratio (SR). The synergistic effects of these strategies indicated that this novel ED system could save â¼40% of the energy consumption at the same SR, compared with conventional two hydraulic-stage ED system (CED). Three stage continuous BWED performance tests, compared with a CED, showed that a 36.9% total energy saving could be achieved using the novel ED system when the BW concentration decreased from 3500 mg/L to the quality requirement of drinking water (â¼450 mg/L).

RESULTS: A total of 51 patients were included in the study (46 women, mean age at diagnosis of infection of 60 years). According to the number of patients with primary SS evaluated in the Registry (n = 8211), the estimated frequency of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 0.62% (95% CI 0.44, 0.80). All but two presented with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, including fever (82%), cough (57%), dyspnoea (39%), fatigue/myalgias (27%) and diarrhoea (24%), and the most frequent abnormalities included raised lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (88%), CRP (81%) and D-dimer (82%) values, and lymphopenia (70%). Infection was managed at home in 26 (51%) cases and 25 (49%) required hospitalization (five required admission to ICU, four died). Compared with patients managed at home, those requiring hospitalization had higher odds of having lymphopenia as laboratory abnormality (adjusted OR 21.22, 95% CI 2.39, 524.09). Patients with comorbidities had an older age (adjusted OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.00, 1.11) and showed a risk for hospital admission six times higher than those without (adjusted OR 6.01, 95% CI 1.72, 23.51) in the multivariate analysis.

Most patients were children living in rural areas with frequent exposure to domesticated animals and wildlife. METHODS: Specimens were further studied with universal and species-specific CoV and CCoV one-step RT-PCR assays, and viral isolation was performed in A72 canine cells. Complete genome sequencing was conducted using Sanger method. RESULTS: Two of eight specimens contained sufficient amounts of CCoVs as confirmed by less-sensitive single-step RT-PCR assays, and one specimen demonstrated cytopathic effects (CPE) in A72 cells. Complete genome sequencing of the virus causing CPE identified it as a novel canine-feline recombinant alphacoronavirus (genotype II) that we named CCoV-HuPn-2018. Most of CCoV-HuPn-2018 genome is more closely related to a CCoV TN-449, while its S gene shared significantly higher sequence identity with CCoV-UCD-1 (S1 domain) and a feline CoV WSU 79-1683 (S2 domain). CCoV-HuPn-2018 is unique for a 36 nt (12-aa) deletion in the N protein and the presence of full-length and truncated 7b non-structural protein which may have clinical relevance. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of a novel canine-feline recombinant alphacoronavirus isolated from a human pneumonia patient. If confirmed as a pathogen, it may represent the eighth unique coronavirus known to cause disease in humans. Our findings underscore the public health threat of animal CoVs and a need to conduct better surveillance for them.","Vlasova, Anastasia N; Diaz, Annika; Damtie, Debasu; Xiu, Leshan; Toh, Teck-Hock; Lee, Jeffrey Soon-Yit; Saif, Linda J; Gray, Gregory C",Clin. infect. dis,423,23

Controversy in this conundrum stems from the scarcity of ontogenetic data from extant lobe-finned fishes. We report the patterning of an autopod-like domain by hoxa13 during fin development of the Australian lungfish, the most closely related extant fish relative of tetrapods. Differences from tetrapod limbs include the absence of digit-specific expansion of hoxd13 and hand2 and distal limitation of alx4 and pax9, which potentially evolved through an enhanced response to shh signaling in limbs. These developmental patterns indicate that the digit program originated in postaxial fin radials and later expanded anteriorly inside of a preexisting autopod-like domain during the evolution of limbs. Our findings provide a genetic framework for the transition of fins into limbs that supports the significance of classical models proposing a bending of the tetrapod metapterygial axis.","Woltering, Joost M; Irisarri, Iker; Ericsson, Rolf; Joss, Jean M P; Sordino, Paolo; Meyer, Axel",Sci.

The aim of this study was to report data of a systematic search performed on papers published in July 2020. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The methodology described in the second edition of the rapid living systematic review was applied to search eligible papers included in the databases between July 1, 2020 and July 31, 2020. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Eight-hundred-ninety-two papers were identified through database searching (after removal of duplicates); of these, only 23 studies were included. According to OCEBM 2011 Levels of Evidence Table, they were level 3 in 30.5% cases and level 4 in 69.5%. No RCT was found. Nineteen papers studied COVID-19 patients, assessed in the acute (10 studies), post-acute (8 studies) and chronic phase (one study). Four studies reported data on the impact of COVID-19 on subjects with pre-existing health conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The current literature production still focuses more on describing all the possible aspects and complications of the pathology than on interventions or new organization models to deal with it. Albeit evidence on handling COVID-19 from a rehabilitative point of view is improving each month, further studies are still mandatory to report the role of rehabilitation in this scenario.","Negrini, Francesco; de Sire, Alessandro; Andrenelli, Elisa; Lazzarini, Stefano G; Patrini, Michele; Ceravolo, Maria G",Eur J Phys Rehabil Med,423,13

This study aimed to compare the mental health status during the pandemic in the general population of seven middle income countries (MICs) in Asia (China, Iran, Malaysia, Pakistan, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam). All the countries used the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) to measure mental health. There were 4479 Asians completed the questionnaire with demographic characteristics, physical symptoms and health service utilization, contact history, knowledge and concern, precautionary measure, and rated their mental health with the IES-R and DASS-21. Descriptive statistics, One-Way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and linear regression were used to identify protective and risk factors associated with mental health parameters. There were significant differences in IES-R and DASS-21 scores between 7 MICs (p<0.05). Thailand had all the highest scores of IES-R, DASS-21 stress, anxiety, and depression scores whereas Vietnam had all the lowest scores. The risk factors for adverse mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic include age <30 years, high education background, single and separated status, discrimination by other countries and contact with people with COVID-19 (p<0.05). The protective factors for mental health include male gender, staying with children or more than 6 people in the same household, employment, confidence in doctors, high perceived likelihood of survival, and spending less time on health information (p<0.05). This comparative study among 7 MICs enhanced the understanding of metal health in the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Wang, Cuiyan; Tee, Michael; Roy, Ashley Edward; Fardin, Mohammad A; Srichokchatchawan, Wandee; Habib, Hina A; Tran, Bach X; Hussain, Shahzad; Hoang, Men T; Le, Xuan T; Ma, Wenfang; Pham, Hai Q; Shirazi, Mahmoud; Taneepanichskul, Nutta; Tan, Yilin; Tee, Cherica; Xu, Linkang; Xu, Ziqi; Vu, Giang T; Zhou, Danqing; Koh, Bernard J; McIntyre, Roger S; Ho, Cyrus; Ho, Roger C; Kuruchittham, Vipat",PLoS One,423,29

Financial strain, personal debt, recent job loss and housing insecurity are important risk factors for the mental health of working-age adults. Community interventions have the potential to attenuate the mental health impact of these stressors. We examined the effectiveness of community interventions for protecting and promoting the mental health of working-age adults in high-income countries during periods of financial insecurity. METHODS: Eight electronic databases were systematically screened for experimental and observational studies published since 2000 measuring the effectiveness of community interventions on mental health outcomes. We included any non-clinical intervention that aimed to address the financial, employment, food or housing insecurity of participants. A review protocol was registered on the PROSPERO database (CRD42019156364) and results are reported in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. RESULTS: From 2326 studies screened, 15 met our inclusion criteria. Five categories of community intervention were identified: advice services colocated in healthcare settings; link worker social prescribing; telephone debt advice; food insecurity interventions; and active labour market programmes. In general, the evidence for effective and cost-effective community interventions delivered to individuals experiencing financial insecurity was lacking. From the small number of studies without a high risk of bias, there was some evidence that financial insecurity and associated mental health problems were amenable to change and differences by subpopulations were observed. CONCLUSION: There is a need for well-controlled studies and trials to better understand effective ingredients and to identify those interventions warranting wider implementation.","McGrath, Michael; Duncan, Fiona; Dotsikas, Kate; Baskin, Cleo; Crosby, Liam; Gnani, Shamini; Hunter, Rachael Maree; Kaner, Eileen; Kirkbride, James Bowes; Lafortune, Louise; Lee, Caroline; Oliver, Emily; Osborn, David P; Walters, Kate R; Dykxhoorn, Jennifer",J. epidemiol. community health (1979),423,13

CLF states that we should prioritise the needs of individuals who have had less opportunity to experience the events that characterise a complete life. Persad et al argue that their system is the product of a successful process of reflective equilibrium-a philosophical methodology whereby theories, principles and considered judgements are balanced with each other and revised until we achieve an acceptable coherence between our various beliefs. Yet I argue that many of the principles and intuitions underpinning CLF conflict with each other, and that Persad et al have failed to achieve an acceptable coherence between them. I focus on three tensions in particular: the conflict between the youngest first principle and Persad et al's investment refinement; the conflict between current medical need and a concern for lifetime equality; and the tension between adopting an objective measure of complete lives and accommodating for differences in life narratives.","Symons, Xavier",J Med Ethics,423,21

METHODS: An online survey assessing COVID-19 status, RMD diagnoses, adherence and information sources was disseminated via the Arthritis Ireland website and social media channels. RESULTS: There were 1381 respondents with 74.8% on immunosuppressive medication. Symptoms of COVID-19 were reported by 3.7% of respondents of which 0.46% tested positive, consistent with the general Irish population. The frequency of COVID-19 symptoms was higher for respondents with spondyloarthropathy [odds ratio (OR) 2.06, 95% CI: 1.14, 3.70] and lower in those on immunosuppressive medication (OR 0.48, 95% CI: 0.27, 0.88), and those compliant with health authority (HSE) guidance (OR 0.47, 95% CI: 0.25, 0.89). Adherence to RMD medications was reported in 84.1%, with 57.1% using health authority guidelines for information on medication use. Importantly, adherence rates were higher amongst those who cited guidelines (89.3% vs 79.9%, P <0.001), and conversely lower in those with COVID-19 symptoms (64.0% vs 85.1%, P =0.009). Finally, the use of virtual clinics was supported by 70.4% of respondents. CONCLUSION: The rate of COVID-19 positivity in RMD patients was similar to the general population. COVID-19 symptoms were lower amongst respondents on immunosuppressive medication and those adherent to medication guidelines. Respondents were supportive of HSE advice and virtual clinics.","Murray, Kieran; Quinn, Sean; Turk, Matthew; O039,; Rourke, Anna; Molloy, Eamonn; Neill, Lorraine; Mongey, Ann Barbara; Fearon, Ursula; Veale, Douglas J",Rheumatology (Oxford),423,23

Objective: We investigated COVID-19 patients with different serum calcium levels. DESIGN: We checked the serum calcium level of the patients based on days after symptom onset as well as the severity of COVID-19. We also checkeed multi-organ injuries and immune cytokines level in their blood. RESULTS: Both mild/moderate and severe critical cases we observed showed low calcium level in the early stage of viral infection, while the severe/critical cases showed significant lower calcium level than mild/moderate cases in the early stage. We also found that low calcium level related to severe/critical multi-organ injuries especially in the mild/moderate population. Proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 also correlated to calcium change in both mild/moderate and severe/critical cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our finding indicates that calcium balance is a primal hit of COVID-19 and a biomarker of clinical severity at the beginning of symptom onset. Calcium is closely associated with virus-associated multiple organ injuryes and the increase of inflammatory cytokines. Our results provide a new, important indicator of COVID-19 patients from mild/moderate to severe/critical: serum calcium.","Zhou, Xi; Chen, Dong; Wang, Lan; Zhao, Yuanyuan; Wei, Lai; Chen, Zhishui; Yang, Bo",Biosci. rep,423,23

Objectives: To establish a baseline reference value for fetal ear length and to assess relationship between fetal ear length and gestational age. Methods: Ear length measurements were obtained prospectively from fetuses in 551 normal singleton pregnancies of 15 to 41 weeks gestation. Normal cases were defined as normal sonographic findings during examination plus normal infant post-delivery. The relationship between gestational age (GA) in weeks and fetal ear length (FEL) in millimeters were analyzed by simple linear regression.

Further understanding of the epidemiology of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the risk perception of the community may better inform targeted interventions to reduce the impact and spread of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to examine the association between chronic diseases and serious outcomes following COVID-19 infection, and to explore its influence on people's self-perception of risk for worse COVID-19 outcomes. METHODS: This study draws data from two databases: (1) the nationwide database of all confirmed COVID-19 cases in Portugal, extracted on April 28, 2020 (n=20,293); and (2) the community-based COVID-19 Barometer survey, which contains data on health status, perceptions, and behaviors during the first wave of COVID-19 (n=171,087). We assessed the association between relevant chronic diseases (ie, respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal diseases; diabetes; and cancer) and death and intensive care unit (ICU) admission following COVID-19 infection. We identified determinants of self-perception of risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes using logistic regression models. RESULTS: Respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal diseases were associated with mortality and ICU admission among patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 infection (odds ratio [OR] 1.48, 95% CI 1.11-1.98; OR 3.39, 95% CI 1.80-6.40; and OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.66-3.06, respectively). Diabetes and cancer were associated with serious outcomes only when considering the full sample of COVID-19-infected cases in the country (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.03-1.64; and OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.03-1.89, respectively). Older age and male sex were both associated with mortality and ICU admission. The perception of risk for severe COVID-19 disease in the study population was 23.9% (n=40,890). This was markedly higher for older adults (n=5235, 46.4%), those with at least one chronic disease (n=17,647, 51.6%), or those in both of these categories (n=3212, 67.7%). All included diseases were associated with self-perceptions of high risk in this population. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate the association between some prevalent chronic diseases and increased risk of worse COVID-19 outcomes. It also brings forth a greater understanding of the community's risk perceptions of serious COVID-19 disease. Hence, this study may aid health authorities to better adapt measures to the real needs of the population and to identify vulnerable individuals requiring further education and awareness of preventive measures.","Laires, Pedro Almeida; Dias, Sónia; Gama, Ana; Moniz, Marta; Pedro, Ana R; Soares, Patricia; Aguiar, Pedro; Nunes, Carla",JMIR Public Health Surveill,423,16

Here, we evaluated the clinical and epidemiological parameters associated with COVID-19 in South India. Methods A retrospective, quaternary care hospital-based study that included COVID-19 positive patients admitted to MIOT International Hospital, Chennai between 8 April–7 August 2020. Cases were identified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological findings were recorded and analyzed. The primary endpoint was stable discharge from hospital/patient recovery or death. Associations between risk factors and comorbidities were analyzed using Chi-Square/Fisher's exact test. Results Of the 5264 cases reviewed, 3345 cases were included. The mean (standard deviation, SD) age of the patients was 47.58 (16.69) years with a median and range hospital stay of 5 (2–41) days. 69.20% of patients were male. The most frequent comorbidities were diabetes (37.10%) and hypertension (29.10%). Contact history was available for 58% of patients. The most common symptoms were cough (36.60%), fever (28.30%), and myalgia (15.40%). Abnormal chest radiography was reported in 16.9% of patients. Phase of admission, age ≥50 years, hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease was significantly associated with mortality (p &lt; 0.05). There were 142 (4.2%) deaths in this study. Conclusion In this single centre hospital-based study, late presentation and more severe form of COVID pneumonia lead to higher mortality although it had lower mortality rate for COVID-19 in comparison. Late phase of the pandemic showed better outcomes vs. the early group.","Mohandas, Prithvi Periasamy Sathya Marappan Manimaran Sampath Arun Garfin Sundaram Vanaja Kate Cherian Vijit Koshy",Clinical Epidemiology and Global Health,423,16

The publicly available dataset Worldometer (extracted on April 5, 2020) confirmed by WHO report was available for meta-analysis purposes using the Meta-MUMS tool. And, the reported outcomes of the analysis used a random-effects model to evaluate the event rate, and risk ratios thorough subgroup analysis forest plots. Seventeen countries for COVID-19 and eight countries of SARS infections, including COVID-19 group n = 1124243, and SARS-CoV group n = 8346, were analyzed. In this meta-analysis, a random effect model of relations of incidence, mortality, and recovery rates of COVID-19 and SARS world infections were determined. The meta-analysis and forest plots of two viral world infections showed that the incidence rate of COVID-19 infection is more than SARS infections, while recovery and mortality event rates of SARS-CoV are more than COVID-19 infection. And subgroup analysis showed that the mortality and recovery rates were higher in both SARS-CoV wand COVID-19 in comparison to incidence and mortality rates, respectively. In conclusion, the meta-analysis approach on the abovementioned dataset revealed the epidemiological and statistical analyses for comparing COVID-19 and SARS-CoV outbreaks.","Sokouti, Massoud; Sadeghi, Ramin; Pashazadeh, Saeid; Eslami, Saeid; Sokouti, Mohsen; Ghojazadeh, Morteza; Sokouti, Babak",Arch Med Res,423,29

In this case report, we describe the clinical features of 5 rheumatic immune disease patients with the concomitant presence of COVID-19. Amongst these patients, 4 had rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 1 had systemic sclerosis (SSc). Two patients had a history of close contact with a COVID-19 patient. The age of the patients ranged between 51 and 79 years. Fever (80%), cough (80%), dyspnea (40%), and fatigue (20%) were the most common presenting symptoms. Laboratory investigations revealed leukopenia and lymphopenia in 2 patients. In all the patients, chest computerized tomography (CT) revealed patchy ground glass opacities in the lungs. During the hospital stay, the condition of two patients remained the same (i.e., mild COVID-19), two patients progressed to the severe COVID-19, and one patient worsened to the critically ill COVID-19.

In this study, the efficiency of prevention and control measures in China, Italy, Iran, South Korea, and Japan was assessed, and the COVID-19 epidemic tendency among these countries was compared. Results showed that the effective reproduction number(Re) in Wuhan, China increased almost exponentially, reaching a maximum of 3.98 before a lockdown and rapidly decreased to below 1 due to containment and mitigation strategies of the Chinese government. The Re in Italy declined at a slower pace than that in China after the implementation of prevention and control measures. The Re in Iran showed a certain decline after the establishment of a national epidemic control command, and an evident stationary phase occurred because the best window period for the prevention and control of the epidemic was missed. The epidemic in Japan and South Korea reoccurred several times with the Re fluctuating greatly. The epidemic has hardly rebounded in China due to the implementation of prevention and control strategies and the effective enforcement of policies.

Through the panel analysis, we found consistent results that healthcare system conditions, particularly the number of hospital beds and medical staff, have played extremely important roles in reducing death rates of COVID-19 infected persons. In addition, both the mortality rates due to different non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and rate of people aged 65 and over were significantly related to the death rates. We also found that controlling international and domestic travelling by air along with increasingly popular anti-COVID-19 actions (i.e., quarantine and social distancing) would help reduce the death rates in all countries. We conducted tests for robustness and found that the Driscoll and Kraay (1998) method was the most suitable estimator with a finite sample, which helped confirm the robustness of our estimations. Based on the findings, we suggest that preparedness of healthcare systems for aged populations need more attentions from the public and politicians, regardless of income level, when facing COVID-19-like pandemics.","Giang, Thanh-Long; Vo, Dinh-Tri; Vuong, Quan-Hoang",Sustainability,423,24

This can affect the pulmonary health and the gastrointestinal system. OBJECTIVE: This review aimed to discuss the impact of probiotics/ prebiotics and supplements on the prevention and treatment of respiratory infections, especially emerging pathogens. METHODS: The data were searched were searched in PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, Google Patents, and The Lens-Patent using keywords of probiotics and viral respiratory infections in the title, abstract, and keywords. RESULT: Probiotics consumption could decrease the susceptibility to viral respiratory infections, such as COVID-19 and simultaneously enhance vaccine efficiency in infectious disease prevention through the immune system enhancement. Probiotics improve the gut microbiota and the immune system via regulating the innate system response and production of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, treatment with probiotics contributes to the intestinal homeostasis restitution under antibiotic pressure and decreasing the risk of secondary infections due to viral respiratory infections. Probiotics present varied performances in different conditions; thus, promoting their efficacy through combining with supplements (prebiotics, postbiotics, nutraceuticals, berberine, curcumin, lactoferrin, minerals, and vitamins) is important. Several supplements reported to enhance the probiotics' efficacy and their mechanisms as well as probiotics related patents are summarized in this review.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the performance of two different routinely used immunoassays in hospitalized and outpatient COVID-19 cases. METHODS: The test characteristics of commercially available spike1 protein-based serological assays (Euroimmun, EI-assays), determining IgA or IgG and nucleocapsid-based assays (Virotech, VT-assays) determining IgA, IgM or IgG were compared in 139 controls and 116 hospitalized and outpatient COVID-19 cases. RESULTS: Hospitalized COVID-19 patients (n = 51; 115 samples) showed significantly higher concentrations of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and differed from outpatient cases (n = 65) by higher age, higher disease severity scores and earlier follow up blood sampling.

Glucose administration increased the CART immunoreactivity in the entopeduncular neurons (EN), preoptic area (POA), ventral hypothalamus (vHy) and the Edinger Westphal nucleus (EW) while CART positive cells decrease in response to fasting and glucoprivation. A substantial decrease in CART was noted in the EW nucleus of tadpoles injected with 2DG. These regions might contain the glucose-sensing neurons and regulate food intake in anurans. Therefore, we speculate that the function of central CART and its antagonistic action with NPY in food and feeding circuitry of anurans is evolutionary conserved and might be responsible for glucose homeostasis.","Shewale, Swapnil A; Deshbhratar, Shantaj M; Ravikumar, Ameeta; Bhargava, Shobha Y",Neuropeptides,423,16

357287,357287,357287,Betting on Disaster: Short-Selling Activity during the COVID-19 Pandemic,17.898048,3.569418,2020,"Purpose: The vulnerability of postacute and long-term care (PA/LTC) facility residents to COVID-19 has manifested across the world with increasing facility outbreaks associated with high hospitalization and mortality rates. Systematic protocols to guide telehealth-centered interventions in response to COVID-19 outbreaks have yet to be delineated. This article is intended to inform PA/LTC facilities and neighboring health care partners how to collaboratively utilize telehealth-centered strategies to improve outcomes in facility outbreaks. Methods: The University of Virginia rapidly developed a multidisciplinary telehealth-centered COVID-19 facility outbreak strategy in response to a LTC facility outbreak in which 41 (out of 48) facility residents and 7 staff members tested positive. This strategy focused on supporting the facility team remotely using rapidly deployed technologic solutions. Goals included (1) early identification of patients who need their care escalated, (2) monitoring and treating patients deemed safe to remain in the facility, (3) care coordination to facilitate bidirectional transfers between the skilled nursing facility (SNF) and hospital, and (4) daily facility needs assessment related to technology, infection control, and staff well-being. To achieve these goals, a standardized approach centered on daily multidisciplinary virtual rounds and telemedicine consultation was provided. Results: Over a month since the outbreak began, 18 out of 48 (38%) facility residents required hospitalization and 6 (12.5%) died. Eleven facility residents have since returned back to the SNF after recovering from their hospitalization. No staff required hospitalization. Conclusions: Interventions that reduce hospitalizations and mortality are a critical need during the COVID-19 pandemic. The mortality and hospitalization rates seen in this PA/LTC facility outbreak are significantly lower than has been documented in other facility outbreaks. Our multidisciplinary approach centered on telemedicine should be considered as other PA/LTC facilities partner with neighboring health care systems in responding to COVID-19 outbreaks. We have begun replicating these services to additional PA/LTC facilities facing COVID-19 outbreaks.","Harris, Drew A; Archbald-Pannone, Laurie; Kaur, Jasveen; Cattell-Gordon, David; Rheuban, Karen S; Ombres, Rachel L; Albero, Kimberly; Steele, Rebecca; Bell, Taison D; Mutter, Justin B",Telemed. j. e. health,423,5

However, given the significant impact of COVID-19 on society, the healthcare system, and individuals and their families, it is important to understand how the pandemic has affected cancer information needs in a crisis context and, in turn, how public health agencies have responded to meeting the information needs of various audiences. Using data from the National Cancer Institute's Cancer Information Service (CIS) - a long-standing, multi-channel resource for trusted cancer information in English and Spanish - this descriptive analysis explored differences in cancer information-seeking among cancer survivors, caregivers, tobacco users, and members of the general public during the onset and continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic (February - September 2020), specifically comparing interactions that involved a discussion of COVID-19 to those that did not. During the study period, COVID-19 discussions were more likely to involve survivors or caregivers compared to tobacco users and the general public. Specific patterns emerged across the four user types and their respective discussions of COVID-19 related to language of service, point of CIS access, stage on the cancer continuum, subject of interaction, cancer site discussed, and referrals provided by the CIS. These results provide insights that may help public health agencies deliver, prioritize, and tailor their messaging and response to specific audiences based on heightened health information needs during a crisis.","Vanderpool, Robin C; Huang, Grace C; Mollica, Michelle; Gutierrez, Adrianna I; Maynard, Candace Deaton",Health Commun,423,20

In this paper, we present a modeling approach to understand the fundamental dynamics of exhaled droplets in human respiratory activities. The model solves a series of governing equations of droplets and uses a continuous random walk model to simulate turbulent fluctuations in violent expiratory events. The validation of the model shows the improvement in the prediction of dispersion of median-sized droplets. We show that these droplets are sensitive to environmental conditions, including temperature, humidity, and ambient flows. Applying the model to a set of idealized conditions such as free-fall and continuous jets, we demonstrate significantly different impacts of environmental parameters on droplets with different sizes. Using a realistic droplet size distribution and cough duration, we quantify the transport and fate of droplets in the near field of source and the potential influences by ambient conditions. The model we developed from this study could be applied to study the mechanisms for airborne pathogens, e.g., influenza virus and new coronavirus.","Wang, Binbin; Wu, Huijie; Wan, Xiu-Feng",Phys Fluids (1994),423,16

Once a model has been calibrated, it can be used as a forecasting tool to make predictions and to evaluate contingency plans. It is customary to employ only point estimators for such predictions. However, some models may fit the same data reasonably well for a broad range of parameter values, and this flexibility means that predictions stemming from such models will vary widely, depending on the particular parameter values employed within the range that give a good fit. When data are poor or incomplete, model uncertainty widens further. A way to circumvent this problem is to use Bayesian statistics to incorporate observations and use the full range of parameter estimates contained in the posterior distribution to adjust for uncertainties in model predictions. Specifically, given the epidemiological model and a probability distribution for observations, we use the posterior distribution of model parameters to generate all possible epidemiological curves via the posterior predictive distribution. From the envelope of all curves one can extract the worst-case scenario and study the impact of implementing contingency plans according to this assessment. We apply this approach to the potential evolution of COVID-19 in Mexico City and assess whether contingency plans are being successful and whether the epidemiological curve has flattened.","Mena, Rams'es H.; Velasco-Hernandez, Jorge X.; Mantilla-Beniers, Natalia B.; Carranco-Sapi'ens, Gabriel A.; Benet, Luis; Boyer, Denis; Castillo, Isaac P'erez",,423,0

Of 116 residents, 110 (95%) participated at some level in the response activities including screening/testing, contact tracing, surveillance, data analysis, incident command, provider support, reopening, direct patient care, education, and risk communication. Residents' response activities were in multiple settings, such as state, local, and federal health agencies; hospital systems; long-term care facilities; academic centers; local businesses and labor unions; Federally Qualified Health Centers; homeless shelters; and clinics. Residents' participation was facilitated by their training in public health, epidemiology, the care of patients and populations, and emergency preparedness. Programs should continue to promote these experiences and key roles that PH/GPM and OM residents can play, as this leadership is a necessity for the successful navigation of future major public health events. As the pandemic continues, evaluation of residents' experiences will help guide longer-term changes to program curriculum and partnerships.

Our study aims to describe changes in air pollution levels during the lockdown measures in the city of Barcelona (NE Spain), by studying the time evolution of atmospheric pollutants recorded at the urban background and traffic air quality monitoring stations. After two weeks of lockdown, urban air pollution markedly decreased but with substantial differences among pollutants. The most significant reduction was estimated for BC and NO2 (-45 to -51%), pollutants mainly related to traffic emissions. A lower reduction was observed for PM10 (-28 to -31.0%). By contrast, O3 levels increased (+33 to +57% of the 8â¯h daily maxima), probably due to lower titration of O3 by NO and the decrease of NOx in a VOC-limited environment. Relevant differences in the meteorology of these two periods were also evidenced. The low reduction for PM10 is probably related to a significant regional contribution and the prevailing secondary origin of fine aerosols, but an in-depth evaluation has to be carried out to interpret this lower decrease. There is no defined trend for the low SO2 levels, probably due to the preferential reduction in emissions from the least polluting ships. A reduction of most pollutants to minimal concentrations are expected for the forthcoming weeks because of the more restrictive actions implemented for a total lockdown, which entered into force on March 30th. There are still open questions on why PM10 levels were much less reduced than BC and NO2 and on what is the proportion of the abatement of pollution directly related to the lockdown, without meteorological interferences.","Tobías, Aurelio; Carnerero, Cristina; Reche, Cristina; Massagué, Jordi; Via, Marta; Minguillón, María Cruz; Alastuey, Andrés; Querol, Xavier",Sci Total Environ,423,21

To inform mitigation efforts, on May 19, 2020, the Kentucky Department for Public Health (KDPH) implemented a reporting system to monitor five indicators of state-level COVID-19 status to assess the ability to safely reopen: 1) composite syndromic surveillance data, 2) the number of new COVID-19 cases,* 3) the number of COVID-19-associated deaths, 4) health care capacity data, and 5) public health capacity for contact tracing (contact tracing capacity). Using standardized methods, KDPH compiles an indicator monitoring report (IMR) to provide daily analysis of these five indicators, which are combined with publicly available data into a user-friendly composite status that KDPH and local policy makers use to assess state-level COVID-19 hazard status.

H2 was delivered directly to PdNPs in situ coated on the surface of bubble-free hollow-fiber gas-transfer membranes. The H2-based membrane Pd film reactor (H2-MPfR) achieved a high catalyst-specific TCAA reduction rate, 32 L/g-Pd/min, a value similar to the rate of using homogeneously suspended PdNP, but orders of magnitude higher than with other immobilized PdNP systems.

It plays central roles in a wide variety of applications in Alibaba Group. However, existing structure learning algorithms suffer from considerable limitations in real world applications due to their low efficiency and poor scalability. To resolve this, we propose a new structure learning algorithm LEAST, which comprehensively fulfills our business requirements as it attains high accuracy, efficiency and scalability at the same time. The core idea of LEAST is to formulate the structure learning into a continuous constrained optimization problem, with a novel differentiable constraint function measuring the acyclicity of the resulting graph. Unlike with existing work, our constraint function is built on the spectral radius of the graph and could be evaluated in near linear time w.r.t. the graph node size. Based on it, LEAST can be efficiently implemented with low storage overhead. According to our benchmark evaluation, LEAST runs 1 to 2 orders of magnitude faster than state of the art method with comparable accuracy, and it is able to scale on BNs with up to hundreds of thousands of variables. In our production environment, LEAST is deployed and serves for more than 20 applications with thousands of executions per day. We describe a concrete scenario in a ticket booking service in Alibaba, where LEAST is applied to build a near real-time automatic anomaly detection and root error cause analysis system.

Lao PDR has among the highest rates of malnutrition in Southeast Asia. We assessed the relative difficulty in meeting food needs during the COVID-19 pandemic in rural districts of Luang Prabang Province, Lao PDR compared to before; determined associations between pandemic-associated difficulties in food access and household, maternal and child food security; and identified resiliency-promoting strategies. MethodsIn November 2020, households (N = 1,122) with children under five years were interviewed. Respondents reported the relative ease of access of food and health care as well as changes in income and expenditures compared to before March 2020. We used generalized linear models with cluster robust standard errors to assess univariate and multivariate associations. ResultsNearly four-fifths (78.5%) found it harder to meet household food needs during the pandemic. The most common reasons were increased food prices (51.2%), loss of income (45.3%), and decreased food availability (36.6%). Adjusting for demographics, households with increased difficulty meeting food needs had lower food consumption scores and child dietary diversity. Over 85% of households lost income during the pandemic. Decreased expenditures was associated with reliance on more extreme coping strategies to meet food needs. The households who experienced no change in meeting food needs produced a greater percentage of their food from homegrown methods (4.22% more, 95% CI: 1.28, 7.15), than households who found it more difficult. We estimated that decreases in child bodyweight by 0.5 - 1% would increase wasting in this population by 1.7 - 2.1 percentage points. ConclusionsPandemic-associated shocks may have large effects on malnutrition prevalence. Action is needed to mitigate consequences of the pandemic on nutrition. Local food production and safety net programs that offset income losses may help. Summary BoxO_ST_ABSWhat is already known?C_ST_ABSThe COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted food supply chains and livelihoods, causing concerns that a global nutrition crisis is imminent and prompting leaders from United Nations agencies to issue an immediate call to action to direct funds towards prevention of child malnutrition. While documented COVID-19 transmission in Lao PDR was lower than that of surrounding counties, malnutrition rates are high, particularly in the northern province of Luang Prabang, which is heavily reliant on tourism for livelihoods. What are the new findings?Nearly four-fifths of those interviewed in Luang Prabang Province, Lao PDR reported that it was harder to meet their households food needs, compared to before the pandemic, with 51% attributing the reason to increased food prices. Over 85% of households reported losing income. Lower expenditures and increased difficulty obtaining food were both associated with lower household food consumption scores and higher household coping strategies, in adjusted analyses. Households who obtained a greater proportion of their foods through home production appeared more resilient than households who obtained a greater proportion of their foods through purchasing. What do the new findings imply?The pandemic may deeply exacerbate food insecurity in Lao PDR, potentially leading to increases in child wasting. Increased local food production and establishment of safety net programs that offset income losses may be two strategies that address this problem among this population.","Head, Jennifer R; Chanthavilay, Phetsavanh; Catton, Helen; Vongsitthi, Ammaline; Khamphouxay, Kelley; Simphaly, Niphone",,423,30

Ethical healthcare policies ensure equitable access to care for patients regardless of whether they have COVID-19 or another disease. Because healthcare resources are limited, a cost per Quality Life Year (QALY) approach to COVID-19 policy should also be considered. Policies that focus solely on mitigating COVID-19 are likely to be ethically or financially unsustainable. A cost/QALY approach could target resources to optimally improve QALYs. For example, most COVID-19 deaths occur in long-term care facilities, and this problem is likely better addressed by a focused long-term care reform than by a society-wide non-pharmacological intervention. Likewise, ramping up elective, non-COVID-19 care in low prevalence regions while expanding testing and case tracking in hot spots could reduce excess mortality from non-COVID-19 diseases and decrease adverse financial impacts while controlling the epidemic.

This study aimed at evaluating the relationship between area-level indicators of income and total mortality during the first phase of COVID-19 pandemic in the most hit Italian region. METHODS: We conducted an ecological study based on the number of deaths registered in the municipalities of the Lombardy region (Italy) between January 2019 and June 2020. Municipalities were grouped according to quintiles of average income and pension of their resident population. Monthly age-standardized mortality ratios (MRs) between the poorest and the richest municipalities and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were computed to evaluate whether the pre-existing socioeconomic inequities widened during the pandemic. RESULTS: Over the study period, 175.853 deaths were registered. During the pre-pandemic period (January 2019-February 2020) the MR between the poorest and the richest municipalities ranged between 1.12 (95% CI: 1.00-1.25) and 1.33 (95% CI: 1.20-1.47).

OBJECTIVE: To summarize the most relevant data of a systematic review on the impact of the 2020 school closure and social distances measures implemented in response to covid-19 pandemic on youths physical health and psychological wellbeing. In the present paper we describe the review's methodology and the characteristics and methodological quality of the retrieved studies. METHODS: We searched on 11 international databases up to 1st September 2020 to retrieve cohort studies, cross sectional surveys, uncontrolled pre-post studies and modelling studies. Methodological quality of included studies has been assessed with validated checklists. RESULTS: Sixty-four studies have been included; 42 assessed the effect of social distances measure of physical health and 27 on psychological wellbeing. All the studies have been conducted during the first wave of pandemic and assessed the short-term effect of social distances measures implemented for relatively short periods. The 32.4% of the studies has been conducted in the UK, 20.3% in Italy, 12.5% in China, 10.9% in developing countries and 9.4% in the US. 37.5% of the studies were cohort studies, 40.6% cross sectional surveys, 19.7% uncontrolled studies and 1 was a modeling study. 59.6% of the studies has been rated as high quality. The most important weakness of the cross-sectional surveys and uncontrolled studies was the scarce representativeness of the sample while 96% of the cohort studies were judged as high quality. CONCLUSIONS: A large number of acceptable quality studies have been published during the first months of pandemic to assess the impact of school closure and social distances measures on physical health and psychological wellbeing of youths. This highlights the relevance of the topic and the need to assess carefully the balance between harms and benefits of such measures in terms of actual reduction of transmission and youths' psychological and physical harms. Further studies are needed on the long-term effect of social distances measures extended over long periods.","Minozzi, Silvia; Saulle, Rosella; Amato, Laura; Davoli, Marina",Recenti Prog Med,423,16

The objective of our present study was to assess the impacts and effectiveness of the lockdown protocol in Karnataka and Punjab, compared with the implementation of this method in Australia and the United Kingdom (UK). This study involved the collection of data from different authorized databases, in two phases. The first phase included the time starting with the first-reported index case through the 14th day after the declaration of lockdown, for each country. The second phase involved the data collected between the 15th day through the 28th day of the lockdown. The highest doubling rate for cases was observed in Australia, followed by Karnataka and Punjab, whereas the lowest was observed in the UK. Comparisons of the numbers of the samples tested, the mortality rate, and the recovery rate between Karnataka and Punjab, after the implementation of lockdown, revealed a better recovery rate and lower mortality rate in Karnataka than in Punjab. Our study revealed that the implementation of social distancing and lockdown reduced the transmission of the coronavirus and the number of cases reported.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted, with self-reported data of students from 14 Cuban universities of medical sciences (n=200), through an online survey. The EEP-10-C was used as an instrument to identify stress. Its validity was determined through a confirmatory factor analysis and its internal consistency and reliability was measured by the Cronbach's alpha. A cluster analysis was performed to establish as the cut-off point the centre of the cluster with the highest values of stress perceived by the scale. RESULTS: The average age of the sample was 23.30± 1.91 years, with observed scores of the EEP-10-C between 0 and 29 points (13.25±5.404). When applying the cut-off point &#8805;25, only two students had high rates of perceived stress. The confirmatory factor analysis supported the validity of the instrument (&#945;=0.755). The cut-off point &#8805;20 was proposed as a reference of high stress perceived for the study population, when applying this one, 14% of students presented high rates of stress. CONCLUSIONS: In Cuba, students of the medical sciences have participated in research and healthcare support, despite which they have presented low levels of stress. The main contribution of the research was the validation of the EEP-10-C for its use in assessing levels of stress in Cuban medical students, proposing the cut-off point &#8805;20 as a reference of high stress perceived.","Hernández-García, Frank; Góngora Gómez, Onelis; González-Velázquez, Victor Ernesto; Pedraza-Rodríguez, Elys María; Zamora-Fung, Rolando; Lazo Herrera, Luis Alberto",,423,24

However, the factors that determine host susceptibility and pathogenicity remain elusive. An increasing number of publications highlight the role of Transmembrane Serine Protease 2 (TMPRSS2) in the susceptibility of the host cell to SARS-CoV-2. Cleavage of viral spike protein via the host cell's TMPRSS2 enzyme activity mediates viral entry into the host cell. The enzyme synthesis is regulated by the TMPRSS2 gene, which has also been implicated in the entry mechanisms of previously reported Coronavirus infections. In this review, we have investigated the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 and disease susceptibility dependence on the TMPRSS2 gene as expressed in various population groups. We further discuss how the differential expression of this gene in various ethnic groups can affect the SARS-CoV-2 infection and Coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 outcomes. Moreover, promising new TMPRSS2 protease blockers and inhibitors are discussed for COVID-19 treatment.","Abbasi, Asim Z; Kiyani, Dania A; Hamid, Syeda M; Saalim, Muhammad; Fahim, Ammad; Jalal, Nasir",J. med. virol,423,5

The B.1.617.2 (delta) variant of concern is causing a new wave of infections in many countries, mostly affecting unvaccinated individuals, and has become globally dominant. We show that these variants dampen the in vitro potency of vaccine-elicited serum neutralizing antibodies and provide a structural framework for describing the impact of individual mutations on immune evasion. Mutations in the B.1.617.1 (kappa) and B.1.617.2 (delta) spike glycoproteins abrogate recognition by several monoclonal antibodies via alteration of key antigenic sites, including an unexpected remodeling of the B.1.617.2 (delta) N-terminal domain. The binding affinity of the B.1.617.1 (kappa) and B.1.617.2 (delta) receptor-binding domain for ACE2 is comparable to the ancestral virus whereas B.1.617.2+ (delta+) exhibits markedly reduced affinity.

Lately the major component, oleuropein, has gained extra attention due to the anti-viral activity against SARS-CoV-2 that causes Coronavirus disease (Covid-19). In this study, extraction of the bioactive compounds from olive leaves was conducted using a non-conventional and green method. New generation green solvents, natural deep eutectic solvents (NADES) were used in combination with ultrasound assisted extraction. Screening of NADES type, temperature, and particle size were investigated using one-pot-at-a-time method while, NADES amount and liquid-to-solid ratio were optimized using experimental design. The results were evaluated in terms of total polyphenol yield (YTP), total flavonoid yield (YTF) and antiradical activity (AAR). At the optimized conditions, the highest total polyphenol yield and the highest total flavonoid yield were achieved with choline chloride-fructose-water (CFW) (5:2:5) as 187.31 ± 10.3 mg gallic acid equivalent g-1 dw and 12.75 ± 0.6 mg apigenin equivalent g-1 dw, respectively. The extracts were also analyzed for oleuropein, caffeic acid and luteolin contents. The highest amount of oleuropein and caffeic acid were extracted by glucose-fructose-water (GFW) (1:1:11) as 1630.80 mg kg-1 dw and 112.77 mg kg-1 dw, respectively.

The objectives of this study are 1) to estimate the basic reproduction number (R(0)) of COVID-19 reflecting the infectiousness of the virus and 2) to assess the effectiveness of a range of controlling intervention. Methods: The reported number of daily confirmed cases from January 17 to February 8, 2020 in Hubei province were collected and used for model fit. Four methods, the exponential growth (EG), maximum likelihood estimation (ML), sequential Bayesian method (SB) and time dependent reproduction numbers (TD), were applied to estimate the R(0). Results: Among the four methods, the EG method fitted the data best. The estimated R(0) was 3.49 (95%CI: 3.42-3.58) by using EG method. The R(0) was estimated to be 2.95 (95%CI: 2.86-3.03) after taking control measures. Conclusions: In the early stage of the epidemic, it is appropriate to estimate R(0) using the EG method. Meanwhile, timely and effective control measures were warranted to further reduce the spread of COVID-19.","Wang, Y; You, X Y; Wang, Y J; Peng, L P; Du, Z C; Gilmour, S; Yoneoka, D; Gu, J; Hao, C; Hao, Y T; Li, J H",Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi,423,32

We performed a systematic review to summarize the clinical features, management, and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 who had ST-segment elevation. We searched electronic databases from inception to September 30, 2020 for studies that reported clinical data about COVID-19 patients with ST-segment elevation. Differences between patients with and without obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) on coronary angiography were evaluated. Forty-two studies (35 case reports and seven case series) involving 161 patients were included. The mean age was 62.7 ± 13.6 years and 75% were men. The most frequent symptom was chest pain (78%). Eighty-three percent of patients had obstructive CAD. Patients with non-obstructive CAD had more diffuse ST-segment elevation (13% versus 1%, p = 0.03) and diffuse left ventricular wall-motion abnormality (23% versus 3%, p = 0.02) compared to obstructive CAD. In patients with previous coronary stent (n = 17), the 76% presented with stent thrombosis. In the majority of cases, the main reperfusion strategy was primary percutaneous coronary intervention instead of fibrinolysis. The in-hospital mortality was 30% without difference between patients with (30%) or without (31%) obstructive CAD. Our data suggest that a relatively high proportion of COVID-19 patients with ST-segment elevation had non-obstructive CAD. The prognosis was poor across groups. However, our findings are based on case reports and case series that should be confirmed in future studies.","Diaz-Arocutipa, Carlos; Torres-Valencia, Javier; Saucedo-Chinchay, Jose; Cuevas, Cecilia",J. thromb. thrombolysis,423,16

KPSS: It is the shortening of the Public Personnel Selection Exam. These exams determine people to work in public institutions and organizations in Turkey. The phenomenology model, one of the qualitative research techniques, was used in the study. The study group of the research consists of 34 teacher candidates (male = 19, female = 15) graduated from Usak University, Department of Social Studies. In the collection of data in the research, firstly review of literature about the subject was done, and then a semi-structured interview form was used to apply to social studies teacher candidates. Some questions are standardized, some questions are prepared open-ended. In this type of interview, it is possible to obtain in-depth information. The data collected within the scope of the research were transferred to a word file in computer-mediated and subjected to content analysis. At the end of the research, the most frequently applied sources of candidate teachers preparing for KPSS during the pandemic period is that;videos, books, online lessons, articles and lesson notes. The teacher candidates stated that their families' attitudes towards them were generally positive during the pandemic period. The advantages of the pandemic period was revealed that candidate teachers studied more than usual, the disadvantages of the pandemic period was that there was no activity, anxiety and stress increased, and the fear of getting sick came out. In addition, it was emphasized in the study that preparing for KPSS during the pandemic period is more difficult than preparing for it in the normal period.","Oran, Mehmet",International Education Studies,423,16

It is not well known whether changes in the immune system of pregnant women may lead to a marked susceptibility to infectious processes and the risk of adverse maternal and neonatal complications such as preterm birth, spontaneous abortion, hospitalization in an intensive care unit, transmission to the fetus or newborns, and fetal mortality are poorly understood. Along with this ongoing debate, it is not well defined whether, during pregnancy, the role of host susceptibility in producing a specific inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 may represent distinctive markers of risk of vertical transmission. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 impact on the vaginal microbiome has not yet been described, despite mounting evidence on its possible effect on the gastrointestinal microbiome and its influence on infectious diseases and preterm labor. This report describes the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on a twin pregnancy diagnosed with infection at the third trimester of gestation including tissue infections, inflammatory response, antibody production, cytokine concentration, and vaginal microbiome composition. We identified a pattern of cytokines including IL1-Ra, IL-9 G-CSF, IL-12, and IL-8 differently expressed, already associated with previously infected patients. We detected a similar concentration of almost all the cytokines tested in both twins, suggesting that the SARS-CoV-2-induced cytokine storm is not substantially impaired during the placental passage. The analysis of the vaginal microbiome did not show relevant signs of dysbiosis, similar to other healthy pregnant women and twin healthy pregnancies. The aim of this report was to analyze the immunological response against SARS-CoV-2 infection and virus tissue tropism in a twin pregnancy.","Trombetta, Andrea; Comar, Manola; Tommasini, Alberto; Canton, Melania; Campisciano, Giuseppina; Zanotta, Nunzia; Cason, Carolina; Maso, Gianpaolo; Risso, Francesco Maria",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),423,6

METHODS: We surveyed 235 respondents, 51-95 years old (M = 71.35; SD = 7.39; 74% female), including two open-ended questions concerning COVID-19-related difficulties and positive experiences during the past week. Using inductive coding, we found nine final codes for difficulties and 12 for positives and grouped them into socioecological levels: personal, interpersonal, and societal. RESULTS: Difficulties were reported by 94% of the sample, while 63% described positives. Difficulties and positive responses were made at all socioecological levels and illustrated a dialectic between personal level constraints and opportunities, interpersonal level social isolation and integration, and societal level outrage, sorrow, and social optimism. DISCUSSION: Respondents described sources of vulnerabilities and resilience that supported a socioecological approach to understanding resilience during this pandemic. A notable example was resilience derived from witnessing and contributing to community and social solidarity, highlighting the potential of older adults as resources to their communities during the global pandemic.","Igarashi, Heidi; Kurth, Maria L; Lee, Hye Soo; Choun, Soyoung; Lee, Dylan; Aldwin, Carolyn M",,423,1

Many studies endeavored to reveal the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 compared to the SARS-CoV, in order to find solutions to suppress this high infection rate. Some of these studies showed that the mutations in the SARS-CoV spike (S) protein might be responsible for its higher affinity to the ACE2 human cell receptor. In this work, we used molecular dynamics simulations and Monte Carlo sampling to compare the binding affinities of the S proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 to the ACE2. Our results show that the protein surface of the ACE2 at the receptor binding domain (RBD) exhibits negative electrostatic potential, while a positive potential is observed for the S proteins of SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2. In addition, the binding energies at the interface are slightly higher for SARS-CoV-2 because of enhanced electrostatic interactions. The major contributions to the electrostatic binding energies result from the salt bridges forming between R426 and ACE-2-E329 in the case of SARS-CoV and K417 and ACE2-D30 in the SARS-CoV-2. In addition, our results indicate that the enhancement in the binding energy is not due to a single mutant but rather because of the sophisticated structural changes induced by all these mutations together. This finding suggests that it is implausible for the SARS-CoV-2 to be a lab-engineered virus.","Amin, Muhamed; Sorour, Mariam K; Kasry, Amal",J Phys Chem Lett,423,1

TRIAL DESIGN: This is a prospective, single-center, phase 2, randomized, controlled trial that is blinded to participants and clinical outcome assessor. PARTICIPANTS: Eligible participants include adults (&#8805; 18 years) with evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection by PCR test of nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab within 14 days of randomization, evidence of infiltrates on chest radiography, peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) &#8804; 94% on room air, and/or need for supplemental oxygen, non-invasive mechanical ventilation, or invasive mechanical ventilation, who are willing and able to provide written informed consent prior to performing study procedures or who have a legally authorized representative available to do so. Exclusion criteria include participation in another clinical trial of anti-viral agent(s)* for coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), receipt of any anti-viral agent(s)* with possible activity against SARS-CoV-2 <24 hours prior to plasma infusion, mechanical ventilation (including extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [ECMO]) for &#8805; 5 days, severe multi-organ failure, history of allergic reactions to transfused blood products per NHSN/CDC criteria, known IgA deficiency, and pregnancy. Included participants will be hospitalized at the time of randomization and plasma infusion. *Use of remdesivir as treatment for COVID-19 is permitted. The study will be undertaken at Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York, USA. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: The investigational treatment is anti-SARS-CoV-2 human convalescent plasma. To procure the investigational treatment, volunteers who recovered from COVID-19 will undergo testing to confirm the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody to the spike trimer at a 1:400 dilution. Donors will also be screened for transfusion-transmitted infections (e.g. HIV, HBV, HCV, WNV, HTLV-I/II, T. cruzi, ZIKV). If donors have experienced COVID-19 symptoms within 28 days, they will be screened with a nasopharyngeal swab to confirm they are SARS-CoV-2 PCR-negative. Plasma will be collected using standard apheresis technology by the New York Blood Center. Study participants will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive one unit (200 - 250 mL) of anti-SARS-CoV-2 plasma versus one unit (200 - 250 mL) of the earliest available control plasma. The control plasma cannot be tested for presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody prior to the transfusion, but will be tested for anti- SARS-CoV-2 antibody after the transfusion to allow for a retrospective per-protocol analysis. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary endpoint is time to clinical improvement. This is defined as time from randomization to either discharge from the hospital or improvement by one point on the following seven-point ordinal scale, whichever occurs first. 1. Not hospitalized with resumption of normal activities 2. Not hospitalized, but unable to resume normal activities 3. Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen 4. Hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen 5. Hospitalized, requiring high-flow oxygen therapy or non-invasive mechanical ventilation 6. Hospitalized, requiring ECMO, invasive mechanical ventilation, or both 7. Death This scale, designed to assess clinical status over time, was based on that recommended by the World Health Organization for use in determining efficacy end-points in clinical trials in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. A recent clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of lopinavir- ritonavir for patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 used a similar ordinal scale, as have recent clinical trials of novel therapeutics for severe influenza, including a post-hoc analysis of a trial evaluating immune plasma. The primary safety endpoints are cumulative incidence of grade 3 and 4 adverse events and cumulative incidence of serious adverse events during the study period. RANDOMIZATION: Study participants will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive anti-SARS-CoV-2 plasma versus control plasma using a web-based randomization platform. Treatment assignments will be generated using randomly permuted blocks of different sizes to minimize imbalance while also minimizing predictability. BLINDING (MASKING): The study participants and the clinicians who will evaluate post-treatment outcomes will be blinded to group assignment. The blood bank and the clinical research team will not be blinded to group assignment. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMIZED (SAMPLE SIZE): We plan to enroll 129 participants, with 86 in the anti-SARS-CoV-2 arm, and 43 in the control arm. Among the participants, we expect ~70% or n = 72 will achieve clinical improvement. This will yield an 80% power for a one-sided Wald test at 0.15 level of significance under the proportional hazards model with a hazard ratio of 1.5.

We have investigated the incidence and impact of key bacterial/fungal infections in COVID-19 persons in England. Methods We extracted laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases (01/01/2020-02/06/2020) and blood and lower-respiratory specimens positive for 24 genera/species of clinical relevance (01/01/2020-30/06/2020) from Public Health England’s national laboratory surveillance system. We defined coinfection and secondary infection as a culture-positive key organism, isolated within 1-day, or 2-27 days, respectively of the SARS-CoV-2 positive date. We described the incidence and timing of bacterial/fungal infections and compared characteristics of COVID-19 patients with and without bacterial/fungal infection. Results One-percent (n=2,279/223,413) of COVID-19 persons in England had co/secondary infection, &gt;65% were bloodstream infections. The most common causative organisms were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Cases with co/secondary infections were older than without (median 70-years [IQR:58-81] vs 55-years [IQR:38-77]), and a higher percentage of cases with secondary infection were of Black or Asianst ethnicity than cases without (6·7% vs 4·1%, and 9·9% vs 8·2%, respectively, p&lt;0·001). Age-sex-adjusted case fatality rates were higher in COVID-19 cases with a coinfection (23·0% [95%CI:18·8%-27·6%] or secondary infection (26·5% [95%CI:14·5%-39·4%]), than those without (7·6% [95%CI:7·5%-7·7%])(p&lt;0·005). Conclusions Co/secondary bacterial/fungal infections were rare in non-hospitalised and hospitalised persons with COVID-19, varied by ethnicity and age, and were associated with higher mortality. However, the inclusion of non-hospitalized persons with asymptomatic/mild COVID-19 likely underestimated the rate of secondary bacterial/fungal infections. This should inform diagnostic testing and antibiotic prescribing strategy.","Gerver, Sarah M.; Guy, Rebecca Wilson Kate Thelwall Simon Nsonwu Olisaeloka Rooney Graeme Brown Colin S.; Muller-Pebody, Berit Hope Russell Hall Ffph Victoria",Clinical Microbiology and Infection,423,26

Continuous erector spinae plane (ESP) block, a relatively new truncal nerve block, has the potential to provide analgesia for thoracic surgeries while reducing opioid use. However, there have been only a few reports utilising this technique in infants, and none in preterm neonates. We present the perioperative pain management of a preterm neonate requiring thoracotomy. Epidural analgesia was deemed contraindicated due to coexisting coagulopathy; therefore, an ESP catheter was placed. The patient was extubated at the end of the surgery and had excellent pain control with rectal acetaminophen, chloroprocaine infusion via the ESP catheter and with minimal opioid requirement. Continuous ESP block may be safe and effective for postoperative pain management in coagulopathic premature neonates. Chloroprocaine is an effective local anaesthetic in the erector spinae compartment, which has not been previously reported.","Swenson Schalkwyk, Anna; Flaherty, James; Hess, Donavon; Horvath, Balazs",BMJ case reports,423,25

As the numbers expand exponentially, a paucity of data regarding health care workers (HCWs), who are at the forefront of this disaster, exists. Hence we decided to conduct a study amongst the HCWs to determine the prevalence and risk factor stratification. Methods: This was an online questionnaire-based survey of healthcare workers conducted at Max Super Speciality Hospital, Saket, New Delhi, India from 23rd March to 30th April 2020. Data on flu-like symptoms, travel history, posting in high-risk or low risk zones, and prophylactic drugs was collected. Results: Out of the 18000 HCWs who were approached 4403 responded and adequate data of 3667 was available for analysis. 14.7% had flu-like symptoms. 1.8% (20/1113) of the participants tested were positive for the virus. HCWs posted in the high-risk zones had more symptoms than those working in low-risk zones (169/539, 31.4% vs 679/3128, 21.7%), p<0.001; but no difference in COVID-19 positivity rates (p=0.849). Symptomatic HCWs had higher positivity (10/193, 5.2%) than the asymptomatic ones (10/920, 1.1%), p=0.001. HCQ was taken by 755/1113 (67.8%) people and 14 (1.9%) of these reported positive for the virus. Conclusion: This is the first study on healthcare workers from India to the best of our knowledge. Our findings suggest that posting in a high-risk zone with adequate PPE does not pose higher risk to the HCWs. Moreover, HCQ as a prophylactic has no use.

Pregnant women are a group requiring special attention in medicine given the anatomical and physiological changes that occur during pregnancy. Skin rash is commonly associated with pregnancy, with the most common form of an erythematous maculopapular rash being pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy. Skin rash is also an increasingly reported initial presentation in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), due to infection with SARS-CoV-2. CASE REPORT A 34-year-old woman with a diamniotic dichorionic twin pregnancy presented with clinical picture characterized by dermatological manifestations, namely an erythematous and papular skin rash associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. A real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (GeneFinder) test was positive for SARS-CoV-2 detection. CONCLUSIONS Ten months after the onset of this pandemic, there is no conclusive evidence indicating that pregnant women represent a sector more or less vulnerable to severe forms of COVID-19 than the general population.

Methods and Results We retrospectively assessed 2297 hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 at Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China, from January 10 to March 30, 2020; and identified 1182 patients with known hypertension on pre-hospitalization therapy. We compared the baseline characteristics and in-hospital mortality between patients with hypertension taking RAS inhibitors (n=355) versus non-RAS inhibitors (n=827). Of the 1182 patients with hypertension (median age 68 years, 49.1% male), 12/355 (3.4%) patients died in the RAS inhibitors group versus 95/827 (11.5%) patients in the non-RAS inhibitors group (P<0.0001). Adjusted hazard ratio for mortality was 0.28 (95% CI 0.15-0.52, P<0.0001) at 45 days in the RAS inhibitors group compared with non-RAS inhibitors group. Similar findings were observed when patients taking angiotensin receptor blockers (n=289) or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (n=66) were separately compared with non-RAS inhibitors group. The RAS inhibitors group compared with non-RAS inhibitors group had lower levels of C-reactive protein (median 13.5 versus 24.4 pg/mL; P=0.007) and interleukin-6 (median 6.0 versus 8.5 pg/mL; P=0.026) on admission. The protective effect of RAS inhibitors on mortality was confirmed in a meta-analysis of published data when our data were added to previous studies (odd ratio 0.44, 95% CI 0.29-0.65, P<0.0001). Conclusions In a large single center retrospective analysis, we observed a protective effect of pre-hospitalization use of RAS inhibitors on mortality in patients with hypertension and coronavirus disease 2019, which might be associated with reduced inflammatory response.","Chen, Chen; Wang, Feng; Chen, Peng; Jiang, Jiangang; Cui, Guanglin; Zhou, Ning; Moroni, Francesco; Moslehi, Javid J; Ammirati, Enrico; Wang, Dao Wen",J Am Heart Assoc,423,26

For equally spaced time intervals, the discrete-time lag-1 vector autoregressive (VAR(1)) model and the continuous-time Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) model are equivalent. It is expected that by taking into account the unequal spacings of the time intervals in real data between observations will lead to an advantage for the OU in terms of predictive accuracy. In this paper, this is claim is being investigated by comparing the predictive accuracy of the OU model to that of the VAR(1) model on typical ESM data obtained in the context of affect research. It is shown that the VAR(1) model outperforms the OU model for the majority of the time series, even though time intervals in the data are unequally spaced. Accounting for measurement error does not change the result. Deleting large abrupt changes on short time intervals (that may be caused by externally driven events) does however lead to a significant improvement for the OU model.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the readiness on the part of teachers to switch/adopt online teaching as a part of their pedagogy. Also, this study analyses relationship between perceived stress (PS) and readiness to change (RTC)/adopt. Design/methodology/approach All the constructs were adapted from established scales, exploratory factor analysis confirmed item loadings on the appropriate constructs. Convenience sampling was used for data collection;owing to COVID-19 this appeared to be the only viable method. Partial least square structural equation modelling was used for analysis of data. Findings Results from this study indicate that 32.2% variance in RTC is accounted for by exogenous constructs perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and autonomy (AUT). Although f2 effect size pointed towards non-significance of AUT in predicting RTC (path coefficients were found to be significant for all the exogenous constructs). Also, RTC accounted for 32.6% variance in PS. To assess the predictive relevance of the model, blindfolding procedure was used to obtain Q2 values (Q2PS = 0.231;Q2RTC = 0.243). Positive Q2 values provide support for the model's predictive relevance. Research limitations/implications Data were collected from teachers employed in urban public schools. A complete picture can be obtained by involving teachers from rural public and state-run schools. Practical implications Teachers' readiness to adopt online teaching as a part of their pedagogy may act as a starting point for the policymakers to design properly structured training programs for teachers that minimise stress levels. Social implications If not handled properly, the society may end with either loss of learning to one generation or a major chunk of stressed-out teaching populations or both.

China has experienced the unprecedented epidemic of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in an era when social media has fundamentally transformed information production and consumption patterns. OBJECTIVE: This study examined public engagement and government responsiveness in the communications about COVID-19 during the early epidemic stage based on an analysis of data from Sina Weibo, a major social media platform in China. METHODS: Weibo data relevant to COVID-19 from December 1, 2019, to January 31, 2020, were retrieved. Engagement data (likes, comments, shares, and followers) of posts from government agency accounts were extracted to evaluate public engagement with government posts online. Content analyses were conducted for a random subset of 644 posts from personal accounts of individuals, and 273 posts from 10 relatively more active government agency accounts and the National Health Commission of China to identify major thematic contents in online discussions. Latent class analysis further explored main content patterns, and chi-square for trend examined how proportions of main content patterns changed by time within the study time frame. RESULTS: The public response to COVID-19 seemed to follow the spread of the disease and government actions but was earlier for Weibo than the government. Online users generally had low engagement with posts relevant to COVID-19 from government agency accounts. The common content patterns identified in personal and government posts included sharing epidemic situations; general knowledge of the new disease; and policies, guidelines, and official actions. However, personal posts were more likely to show empathy to affected people (&#967;21=13.3, P<.001), attribute blame to other individuals or government (&#967;21=28.9, P<.001), and express worry about the epidemic (&#967;21=32.1, P<.001), while government posts were more likely to share instrumental support (&#967;21=32.5, P<.001) and praise people or organizations (&#967;21=8.7, P=.003). As the epidemic evolved, sharing situation updates (for trend, &#967;21=19.7, P<.001) and policies, guidelines, and official actions (for trend, &#967;21=15.3, P<.001) became less frequent in personal posts but remained stable or increased significantly in government posts. Moreover, as the epidemic evolved, showing empathy and attributing blame (for trend, &#967;21=25.3, P<.001) became more frequent in personal posts, corresponding to a slight increase in sharing instrumental support, praising, and empathizing in government posts (for trend, &#967;21=9.0, P=.003). CONCLUSIONS: The government should closely monitor social media data to improve the timing of communications about an epidemic. As the epidemic evolves, merely sharing situation updates and policies may be insufficient to capture public interest in the messages.

Although coronaviruses often affect the upper or lower respiratory tract, viral shedding in plasma or serum can occur and therefore, there is a theoretical risk regarding the transmission of these viruses by transfusion. Experience with other viruses from the corona family group (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) tells us that Covid-19 might have a significant impact on blood supply.

DESIGN: Multicenter, prospective, observational study. SETTING: 78 centers participating in the Spanish COVID19 Registry. PATIENT(S): 1,347 pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 positive results registered consecutively between February 26 and November 5, 2020. INTERVENTION(S): The patients' information was collected from their medical records, and multivariable regression analyses were performed, controlling for maternal age and the clinical presentation of the infection. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Obstetrics and neonatal outcomes, pregnancy comorbidities, intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation need, and medical conditions. RESULT(S): The IVF group included 74 (5.5%) women whereas the spontaneous pregnancy group included 1,275 (94.5%) women. The operative delivery rate was high in all patients, especially in the IVF group, where cesarean section became the most frequent method of delivery (55.4%, compared with 26.1% of the spontaneous pregnancy group). The reason for cesarean section was induction failure in 56.1% of the IVF patients. IVF women had more gestational hypertensive disorders (16.2% vs. 4.5% among spontaneous pregnancy women, adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 5.31, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.45-10.93) irrespective of oocyte origin. The higher rate of intensive care unit admittance observed in the IVF group (8.1% vs. 2.4% in the spontaneous pregnancy group) was attributed to preeclampsia (aOR 11.82, 95% CI 5.25-25.87), not to the type of conception. CONCLUSION(S): A high rate of operative delivery was observed in pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2, especially in those with IVF pregnancies; method of conception did not affect fetal or maternal outcomes, except for preeclampsia.

This event was one of the best-localized compact binary coalescences detected in O3 (with 50%/90% error regions of 13/72 deg$^2$), and so the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory performed rapid near-UV/X-ray follow-up observations. Swift-XRT and UVOT covered approximately 79.2% and 62.4% (respectively) of the GW error region, making S200224ca the BBH event most thoroughly followed-up in near-UV (u-band) and X-ray to date. No likely EM counterparts to the GW event were found by the Swift BAT, XRT, or UVOT, nor by other observatories. Here we report on the results of our searches for an EM counterpart, both in the BAT data near the time of the merger, and in follow-up UVOT/XRT observations. We also discuss the upper limits we can place on EM radiation from S200224ca, and the implications these limits have on the physics of BBH mergers. Namely, we place a shallow upper limit on the dimensionless BH charge, $\hat{q}<1.4 \times10^{-4}$, and an upper limit on the isotropic-equivalent energy of a blast wave $E<4.1\times10^{51}$ erg (assuming typical GRB parameters).","Klingler, N.

Objective: To determine the fear perception according to factors associated with the COVID-19 pandemic in Peru. Methods: An analytical cross-sectional study was conducted based on a virtual questionnaire. The main question was ""how much fear people had of COVID-19?"", using a scale from zero (without fear) to 10 (very fear). This scale was divided into tertiles, and the upper tertile was the reference category (compared to the middle and lower tertiles).

METHODS: This is a pilot multicenter retrospective study including patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to the ERs in three hospitals in Italy between February and March of 2020. Two radiologists independently evaluated the baseline CXR of the patients using a semi-quantitative score to determine the severity of lung involvement: a score of 0 represented no lung involvement, whereas scores of 1 to 4 represented the first (less severe) to the fourth (more severe) quartiles regarding the severity of lung involvement. Relevant clinical and laboratory data were collected. The outcome of patients was defined as severe if noninvasive ventilation (NIV) or intubation was necessary, or if the patient died. RESULTS: Our sample comprised 140 patients. Most of the patients were symptomatic (132/138; 95.7%), and 133/140 patients (95.0%) presented with opacities on CXR at admission. Of the 140 patients, 7 (5.0%) showed no lung involvement, whereas 58 (41.4%), 31 (22.1%), 26 (18.6%), and 18 (12.9%), respectively, scored 1, 2, 3, and 4. In our sample, 66 patients underwent NIV or intubation, 37 of whom scored 1 or 2 on baseline CXR, and 28 patients died.

The genomes of large RNA viruses, such as those from coronaviruses, are cumbersome to clone and manipulate in Escherichia coli owing to the size and occasional instability of the genome1-3. Therefore, an alternative rapid and robust reverse-genetics platform for RNA viruses would benefit the research community. Here we show the full functionality of a yeast-based synthetic genomics platform to genetically reconstruct diverse RNA viruses, including members of the Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae and Pneumoviridae families. Viral subgenomic fragments were generated using viral isolates, cloned viral DNA, clinical samples or synthetic DNA, and these fragments were then reassembled in one step in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using transformation-associated recombination cloning to maintain the genome as a yeast artificial chromosome. T7 RNA polymerase was then used to generate infectious RNA to rescue viable virus. Using this platform, we were able to engineer and generate chemically synthesized clones of the virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)4, which has caused the recent pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), in only a week after receipt of the synthetic DNA fragments. The technical advance that we describe here facilitates rapid responses to emerging viruses as it enables the real-time generation and functional characterization of evolving RNA virus variants during an outbreak.","Thi Nhu Thao, Tran; Labroussaa, Fabien; Ebert, Nadine; V039,; kovski, Philip; Stalder, Hanspeter; Portmann, Jasmine; Kelly, Jenna; Steiner, Silvio; Holwerda, Melle; Kratzel, Annika; Gultom, Mitra; Schmied, Kimberly; Laloli, Laura; Hüsser, Linda; Wider, Manon; Pfaender, Stephanie; Hirt, Dagny; Cippà, Valentina; Crespo-Pomar, Silvia; Schröder, Simon; Muth, Doreen; Niemeyer, Daniela; Corman, Victor M; Müller, Marcel A; Drosten, Christian; Dijkman, Ronald; Jores, Joerg; Thiel, Volker",Nature,423,24

From a pathophysiological view, in the recent definition, sepsis has been defined as the result of a complex interaction between host response and the infecting organism, resulting in life-threatening organ dysfunction, depending on microcirculatory derangement, cellular hypoxia/dysoxia driven by hypotension and, potentially, death. The high energy expenditure driven by a high metabolic state induced by the host response may rapidly lead to micronutrient depletion. This deficiency can result in alterations in normal energy homeostasis, free radical damage, and immune system derangement. In critically ill patients, micronutrients are still relegated to an ancillary role in the whole treatment, and always put in a second-line place or, frequently, neglected. Only some micronutrients have attracted the attention of a wider audience, and some trials, even large ones, have tested their use, with controversial results. The present review will address this topic, including the recent advancement in the study of vitamin D and protocols based on vitamin C and other micronutrients, to explore an update in the setting of sepsis, gain some new insights applicable to COVID-19 patients, and to contribute to a pathophysiological definition of the potential role of micronutrients that will be helpful in future dedicated trials.","Rossetti, Matteo; Martucci, Gennaro; Starchl, Christina; Amrein, Karin",Medicina (Kaunas),423,14

We also examined whether methylphenidate has a protective effect regarding the risk of contracting RIDs among children with ADHD who have a history of methylphenidate treatment. Children in the Taiwan Maternal and Child Health Database from 2004 to 2016 were included in the present study. Upper and lower RIDs, influenza, ADHD, age, sex, and records of methylphenidate prescription were identified. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to estimate the significance of the risk of RIDs among children with ADHD in comparison with that among children without ADHD after adjustment for sex and age. The self-controlled case series analysis was conducted to examine the protective effect of methylphenidate treatment against RIDs. In total, 85,853 children with ADHD and 1,458,750 children without ADHD were included in the study. After controlling for sociodemographic variables, we observed that children with ADHD had significantly higher risks of upper RIDs, lower RIDs, and influenza infection than did those without ADHD. Among the children with ADHD who had a history of methylphenidate treatment, the risk of contracting RIDs was lower during the methylphenidate treatment period than during the nontreatment period. Children with ADHD had a higher RID risk than those without ADHD.

Using the previously developed structure-based statistical mechanical model of allostery (SBSMMA), we share our experience in analyzing the allosteric signaling, predicting latent allosteric sites, inducing and tuning targeted allosteric response, and exploring the allosteric effects of mutations. This, yet incomplete list of phenomenology, forms a complex and unique allosteric territory of protein function, which should be thoroughly explored. We propose a generic computational framework, which not only allows one to obtain a comprehensive allosteric control over proteins but also provides an opportunity to approach the fragment-based design of allosteric effectors and drug candidates. The advantages of allosteric drugs over traditional orthosteric compounds, complemented by the emerging role of the allosteric effects of mutations in the expansion of the cancer mutational landscape and in the increased mutability of viral proteins, leave no choice besides further extensive studies of allosteric mechanisms and their biomedical implications.","Tee, Wei-Ven; Tan, Zhen Wah; Lee, Keene; Guarnera, Enrico; Berezovsky, Igor N",J Phys Chem B,423,21

DESIGN: We compared, in a cohort of confirmed COVID-19 older patients, three specifically developed scores with a previously established early warning score. Main endpoint was all causes in-hospital death. SETTING: This is a single-center, retrospective observational study, conducted in the Emergency Department (ED) of an urban teaching hospital, referral center for COVID-19. MEASUREMENTS: International Severe Acute Respiratory Infection Consortium Clinical Characterization Protocol-Coronavirus Clinical Characterization Consortium (ISARIC-4C) score, COVID-GRAM Critical Illness Risk Score (COVID-GRAM), quick COVID-19 Severity Index (qCSI), National Early Warning Score (NEWS). PARTICIPANTS: We reviewed the clinical records of the confirmed COVID-19 patients aged &#8805;60 years consecutively admitted to our ED over a six-week period (March 1st to April 15th, 2020). A total of 210 patients, aged between 60 and 98 years were included in the study cohort. RESULTS: Median age was 74 [67-82] and 133 (63.3%) were males. Globally, 42 patients (20.0%) deceased. All the score evaluated showed a fairly good predictive value with respect to in-hospital death. The ISARIC-4C score had the highest area under ROC curve (AUROC) 0.799 [0.738-0.851], followed by the COVID-GRAM 0.785 [0.723-0.838], NEWS 0.764 [0.700-0.819] and qCSI 0.749 [0.685-0.806]. However, these differences were not statistical significant. CONCLUSIONS: Among the evaluated scores, the ISARIC-4C and the COVID-GRAM, calculated at ED admission, had the best performance, although the qCSI had similar efficacy by evaluating only three items. However, the NEWS, already widely validated in clinical practice, had a similar performance and could be appropriate for older patients with COVID-19. This article is protected by copyright.

DESIGN: A seven-week prospective case series was conducted of urgently referred patients from primary care and accident and emergency department. RESULTS: There was a total of 133 referrals. Referral rates fell by 93 per cent over seven weeks, from a mean of 5.4 to 0.4 per day. Reductions were seen in referrals from both primary care (89 per cent) and the accident and emergency department (93 per cent). Presentations of otitis externa and epistaxis fell by 83 per cent, and presentations of glandular fever, tonsillitis and peritonsillar abscess fell by 67 per cent. CONCLUSION: Coronavirus disease 2019 has greatly reduced the number of referrals into secondary care ENT. The cause for this reduction is likely to be due to patients' increased perceived risk of the virus presence in a medical setting. The impact of this reduction is yet to be ascertained, but will likely result in a substantial increase in emergency pressures once the lockdown is lifted and the general public's perception of the coronavirus disease 2019 risk reduces.","Osborne, M S; Bentley, E; Farrow, A; Chan, J; Murphy, J",J Laryngol Otol,423,1

We sought to determine changes in overdose events and naloxone administration practices by EMS clinicians. METHODS: Between April 29, 2020 and May 15, 2020, we surveyed directors of EMS fellowship programs across the US about how overdose events and naloxone administration practices had changed in their catchment areas since March 2020. RESULTS: Based on 60 respondents across all regions of the country, one fifth of surveyed communities have experienced an increase in opioid overdoses and events during which naloxone was administered, and 40% have experienced a decrease. The findings varied by region of the country. Eighteen percent of respondents have discouraged or prohibited the use of intranasal naloxone with 10% encouraging the use of intramuscular naloxone. CONCLUSIONS: These findings may provide insight into changes in opioid overdose mortality during this time and assist in future disaster planning.","Cone, David C; Bogucki, Sandy; Burns, Kevin; D039,; Onofrio, Gail; Hawk, Kathryn; Joseph, Daniel; Fiellin, David A",J Addict Med,423,1

Myricetin (MYR) is a naturally occurring flavonol having powerful antioxidant activity. The current research was planned to examine the ameliorative role of MYR against NP-induced testicular damage. A total of 24 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 4 equivalent groups: control (0.1% DMSO), NP group (50 mg kg-1), NP + MYR group (50 mg kg-1; 100 mg kg-1), and MYR-treated group (100 mg kg-1). NP administration significantly (p < 0.05) decreased the activity of antioxidant enzymes, including catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GSR), and protein content while significantly (p < 0.05) elevating the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Additionally, NP significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the sperm motility, gene expression of testicular steroidogenic enzymes (3ß-HSD, 3ß-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; 17ß-HSD, 17ß-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; StAR, steroidogenic-acute regulatory protein), level of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), plasma testosterone, and daily sperm production (DSP). On the other hand, it raised the testicular cholesterol, dead sperms, and head, midpiece, and tail abnormalities along with abnormal histomorphometry. However, MYR remarkably abrogated NP-induced damages. In conclusion, the outcomes of the study suggest that MYR can effectively alleviate the NP-induced oxidative stress and testicular damages.","Ijaz, Muhammad Umar; Anwar, Haseeb; Iqbal, Shabnoor; Ismail, Hammad; Ashraf, Asma; Mustafa, Shama; Samad, Abdul",,423,6

As COVID-19 spread in the United States, this study therefore aimed to examine age differences in risk perceptions, anxiety and depression. METHOD: In March 2020, a nationally representative address-based sample of 6666 US adults assessed their perceived risk of getting COVID-19, dying if getting it, getting quarantined, losing their job (if currently working), and running out of money. They completed a mental health assessment for anxiety and depression. Demographic variables and pre-crisis depression diagnosis had previously been reported. RESULTS: In regression analyses controlling for demographic variables and survey date, older adult age was associated with perceiving larger risks of dying if getting COVID-19, but with perceiving less risk of getting COVID-19, getting quarantined, or running out of money, as well as less depression and anxiety. Findings held after additionally controlling for pre-crisis reports of depression diagnosis. DISCUSSION: With the exception of perceived infection-fatality risk, US adults who were relatively older appeared to have a more optimistic outlook and better mental health during the early stages of the pandemic. Interventions may be needed to help people of all ages maintain realistic perceptions of the risks, while also managing depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 crisis.

Drawing on a survey of 166 Egyptian agri-food SMEs, this study investigates differences in- and determinants of COVID-19 business risk perception among these enterprises. The empirical results showed that risk perception was highly asymmetric across geographical regions. Enterprises with longer cash flow coverage periods and higher values of total assets perceived significantly lower risk levels, as cash and assets functioned as a buffer against the impact of COVID-19. The findings of the study imply that the ""just-in-time"" approach and the absence of a proactive and preventative stance to risk management reduced the resilience of agri-food SMEs to the risks presented by the pandemic. Generally, enterprises that operate both in domestic and export markets perceived lower COVID-19 risks. Finally, the main export destination to which the surveyed enterprises export was a significant determinant of their risk perception. These findings could be useful to managers of agri-food businesses in terms of better understanding of risks and promotion of risk management practices. More so, they can help design effective policy interventions to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic on Egyptian agri-food SMEs and build up their resilience to future pandemics and shocks.","Abu Hatab, Assem; Lagerkvist, Carl-Johan; Esmat, Abourehab",,423,24

Methods: 42 outpatients were included, 22 of which received a supplement of 10,000 IU of vitamin D3 for 14 days;the remaining 20 outpatients were designated as a control group. Serum levels of transferrin, ferritin, vitamin D, and D-dimer were measured at baseline in both groups. After 14 days, serum levels of total vitamin D were determined in the supplemented group. Results: At baseline, only 19% of infected outpatients had vitamin D levels corresponding to sufficiency. All outpatients with vitamin D insufficiency had at least one symptom associated with the disease, while only 75% of patients with symptoms presented sufficiency. On the seventh and fourteenth day of follow-up, the supplemented group presented fewer symptoms with respect to those non-supplemented. A vitamin D3 dose of 10,000 IU/daily for 14 days was sufficient to raise vitamin D serum concentrations.

The SARS-CoV-2 genomes and other coronaviruses were obtained from GISAID and GenBank. Then the genome was annotated, and potential genetic recombination was investigated. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted and used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help deduce the origin of virus. An annotation has revealed SARS-CoV-2 possessed a similar genomic organisation to bat-SARS-like-CoV collected in China. The genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were very similar, showing 99.6-100% sequence identity. Notably, SARS-CoV-2 was closely related (with 88% identity) to bat-SARS-like coronavirus, but was more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%). Phylogenetic tree of the complete viral genome showed that the virus clustered with bat SARS-like coronavirus. The results of the similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses did not identify any potential genomic recombination events. Therefore, it seems like that the SARS-CoV-2 might be originally hosted by bats, and might have been transmitted to humans via intermediate hosts of currently unknown wild animal(s). Finally, based on the wide spread of SARS-CoV in their natural reservoirs, future studies should focus more on surveillance of coronavirus, and measures against the domestication and consumption of wild animals should be implemented.

A new betacoronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2), has been recognized as the pathogen responsible for this infection. Patients affected by tumors are more vulnerable to infection owing to poor health status, concomitant chronic diseases, and immunosuppressive conditions provoked by both the cancer and antitumor therapies. In this review, we have analyzed some lesser known aspects of the relationship between neoplasms and SARS-CoV-2 infection, starting from the different expression of the ACE2 receptor of the virus in the various neoplastic pathologies, and the roles that different cytokine patterns could have in vulnerability to infection and the appearance of complications. This review also reports the rationale for a possible use of drugs commonly employed in neoplastic therapy, such as bevacizumab, ibrutinib, selinexor, thalidomide, carfilzomib, and PD-1 inhibitors, for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Finally, we have highlighted some diagnostic challenges in the recognition of SARS-CoV-2 infection in cancer-infected patients. The combination of these two health problems—tumors and a pandemic virus—could become a catastrophe if not correctly handled. Careful and judicious management of cancer patients with SARS-Cov-2 could support a better outcome for these patients during the current pandemic.","Allegra, Alessandro; Pioggia, Giovanni; Tonacci, Alessandro; Musolino, Caterina; Gangemi, Sebastiano",Cancers,423,16

The participants in this study were 247 (85% white, 83% female) undergraduate students who completed an online survey that included questions from a Sleep Valuation Item Bank and questions about sleep and daytime functioning. Correlation and regression analyses were conducted to determine associations between sleep valuation, aspects of sleep health and daytime functioning. Mediation analyses were conducted to determine whether the sleep health variables explained the associations between sleep valuation and daytime functioning. In correlation analyses, sleep valuation was negatively associated with sleepiness and sleep quality. It was also associated with daytime functioning, including general mental and physical health, depression, and anxiety. In the regression analyses, daytime impairments including poorer physical and mental health, anxiety, and depression were associated with higher sleep valuation. Poorer sleep health, including greater sleepiness and lower sleep quality, explained these associations and were associated with higher sleep valuation. Thus, while daytime impairments, such as anxiety and depression, are related to sleep valuation, this relationship may be due in part to the sleep disturbance that often co-occurs with these impairments.","Nielson, Spencer A; Taylor, Jordan; Simmons, Zach; Decker, Andrea N; Kay, Daniel B; Cribbet, Matthew R",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),423,24

Educational interventions can be a reduction strategy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Quasi-experimental study, before-after design. Participants were chronic patients admitted into hospitalization services. Medication reconciliation was conducted at admission. The intervention consisted of a training to each prescribing physician with study contents and printed educational material. To study the association between intervention and change of frequency of unintentional discrepancies was made a logistic regression model, adjusting for selected variables. RESULTS: A sample of 54 patients was studied in each stage. In the first stage it was observed that 42.6% of patients had at least one unintentional discrepancy. After intervention the proportion of patients with at least one unintentional discrepancy decreased to 24.1% (p = 0.041). In both stages, omission was the main category of unintentional discrepancy. The significant reduction after the intervention is maintained by controlling for variables such as emergency admission and pre-admission service. CONCLUSIONS: Incidence of unintentional discrepancies in admission is high in chronic hospitalized patients and can be reduced through an educative strategy.","González, Claudio; González, Gabriela; Plaza-Plaza, José Cristian; Godoy, María Inés; Cárcamo, Marcela; Rojas, Cecilia",An. pediatr.

As an antiviral agent, propolis and various constituents have shown promising preclinical efficacy against adenoviruses, influenza viruses, respiratory tract viruses, herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Over 300 chemical components have been identified in propolis, including terpenes, flavonoids, and phenolic acids, with the specific constituent profile varying widely according to geographic origin and regional flora. Propolis and its constituents have demonstrated potential efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 by modulating multiple pathogenic and antiviral pathways. Molecular docking studies have demonstrated high binding affinities of propolis derivatives to multiple SARS-CoV-2 proteins, including 3C-like protease (3CLpro), papain-like protease (PLpro), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein (S-protein), and helicase (NSP13), as well as to the viral target angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Among these compounds, retusapurpurin A has shown high affinity to 3CLpro (G = -9.4 kcal/mol), RdRp (-7.5), RBD (-7.2), NSP13 (-9.4), and ACE2 (-10.4) and potent inhibition of viral entry by forming hydrogen bonds with amino acid residues within viral and human target proteins. In addition, propolis-derived baccharin demonstrated even higher binding affinity towards PLpro (-8.2 kcal/mol). Measures of drug-likeness parameters, including metabolism, distribution, absorption, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) characteristics, also support the potential of propolis as an effective agent to combat COVID-19.","Yosri, N.; El-Wahed, A.

We established myeloma cell lines expressing wild-type (WT), constitutively active (CA) (G12V/G13D/Q61H), or dominant-negative (DN) (S17N)-KRAS and -NRAS, or BRAF-V600E. Cells expressing CA mutants showed increased proteasome maturation protein (POMP) and nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (NRF2) expression. This correlated with an increase in catalytically active proteasome subunit ß (PSMB)-8, PSMB9, and PSMB10, which occurred in an ETS transcription factor-dependent manner. Proteasome chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and caspase-like activities were increased, and this enhanced capacity reduced PI sensitivity, while DN-KRAS and DN-NRAS did the opposite. Pharmacologic RAF or MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitors decreased proteasome activity, and sensitized myeloma cells to PIs. CA-KRAS, CA-NRAS, and CA-BRAF down-regulated expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress proteins, and reduced unfolded protein response activation, while DN mutations increased both. Finally, a bortezomib (BTZ)/MEK inhibitor combination showed enhanced activity in vivo specifically in CA-NRAS models. Taken together, the data support the hypothesis that activating MAPK pathway mutations enhance PI resistance by increasing proteasome capacity, and provide a rationale for targeting such patients with PI/RAF or PI/MEK inhibitor combinations. Moreover, they argue these mutations promote myeloma survival by reducing cellular stress, thereby distancing plasma cells from the apoptotic threshold, potentially explaining their high frequency in myeloma.","Shirazi, Fazal; Jones, Richard J; Singh, Ram K; Zou, Jianxuan; Kuiatse, Isere; Berkova, Zuzana; Wang, Hua; Lee, Hans C; Hong, Samuel; Dick, Larry; Chattopadhyay, Nibedita; Orlowski, Robert Z",Proc.

With the global spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), several concerns have been raised regarding the ability of medical systems to handle sudden changes in the daily routines of healthcare providers. One significant problem is the management of ambulance dispatch and control during a pandemic. To help address this problem, we first analyze ambulance dispatch data records from April 2014 to August 2020 for Nagoya City, Japan. Significant changes were observed in the data during the pandemic, including the state of emergency (SoE) declared across Japan. In this study, we propose a deep learning framework based on recurrent neural networks to estimate the number of emergency ambulance dispatches (EADs) during a SoE. The fusion of data includes environmental factors, the localization data of mobile phone users, and the past history of EADs, thereby providing a general framework for knowledge discovery and better resource management. The results indicate that the proposed blend of training data can be used efficiently in a real-world estimation of EAD requirements during periods of high uncertainties such as pandemics.","Rashed, Essam A.; Kodera, Sachiko; Shirakami, Hidenobu; Kawaguchi, Ryotetsu; Watanabe, Kazuhiro; Hirata, Akimasa",,423,20

METHODS: This cross-sectional survey of physician members of Pediatric Emergency Research Canada and the Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians explored: personal safety/responsibility to care; patient interactions; ethical issues in pandemic care; institutional dynamics and communication practices. Data analysis was descriptive: categorical data were summarised with frequency distributions, continuous data [100 mm visual analog scales (VAS)] were analysed using measures of central tendency. Short open-ended items were coded to identify frequencies of responses. RESULTS: From June 29 to July 29, 2020, 187 respondents (13% response rate) completed the survey: 39% were from Ontario and 20% from Quebec, trained in general (50%) or pediatric (37%) emergency medicine.

All patients (including the seven asymptomatic patients) were admitted based on chest computed tomography features indicative of pneumonia. There were 11 cases in group A (first generation) and 13 cases in group B (second generation, 11 cases; third generation, 2 cases), with no significant differences in clinical and epidemiological characteristics between the two groups, except for sex, duration from symptom onset to hospitalization, and underlying disease (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: For cluster outbreaks, it is important to comprehensively screen close the contacts of the index patient. Special attention should be paid to asymptomatic cases. The clinical management of cluster patients is similar to that of other COVID-19 patients.","Tian, Suochen; Wu, Min; Chang, Zhenqin; Wang, Yunxia; Zhou, Guijie; Zhang, Wenming; Xing, Junmin; Tian, Hui; Zhang, Xihong; Zou, Xiuli; Zhang, Lina; Liu, Mingxin; Chen, Juan; Han, Jian; Ning, Kang; Chen, Shuangfeng; Wu, Tiejun",BMC Public Health,423,16
404905,404905,404905,Nursing Orientation During the COVID-19 Pandemic,18.167467,3.2004156,2021,"INTRODUCTION: In late 2019, a new coronavirus disease known as COVID-19 (novel coronavirus disease 2019) was identified. As there is no any drug to treat this pandemic, the healthcare professionals are disproportionately at higher risk. The mental health outcome is expected to be high. Anxiety is expected to have a significant impact on health professionals, especially among those who work without adequate resources for self-protection. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this research was to assess self-reported anxiety symptoms and associated factors among Ethiopian healthcare professionals in the early stages of the pandemic. METHODS: We have conducted an online cross-sectional study to collect information from healthcare professionals in Ethiopia during the early stage of the outbreak from April 7, 2020 to May 19, 2020. GAD-7 was used for measurement of anxiety. We have used a cut of point of 10 and above to report anxiety symptoms. We have used Google Forms for online data collection and SPSS-22 for analysis. To determine associated factors for anxiety, a binary logistic regression model was used. Variables with p-value < 0.2 during the bivariable binary logistic regression were exported for further analysis in the multivariable binary logistic regression. Finally, variables with p-value <0.05 were considered as significantly associated with the outcomes. RESULTS: Three hundred and eighty-eight healthcare professionals filled the online questionnaire; Majority (71.1%) were males. Significant number of respondents (78.9%) reported lack of adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) at the work place. The prevalence of anxiety was 26.8%. Being female (AOR: 1.88; 95% C.I:1.11, 3.19), visiting/treating 30-150 patients per day (AOR: 3.44; 95% C.I:1.51, 7.84), those employed at private healthcare institutions (AOR: 2.40; 95% C.I:1.17, 4.90), who do not believe that COVID-19 is preventable (AOR: 2.04; 95% C.I:1.04, 4.03) and those who reported lack of PPE (AOR: 1.98; 95% C.I:1.04, 3.79) were more likely to be anxious. CONCLUSIONS: The anxiety prevalence among healthcare professionals in Ethiopia during early stage of COVID-19 pandemic was high. This study shows that lack of preventive equipment, being female, contact with many patients, low self-efficacy and working in private health facilities were risk factors for anxiety. Anxiety prevention among health professionals during COVID-19 pandemic requires a holistic approach including provision of sufficient PPE, improving self-efficacy and addressing problems both at public and private institutions and focusing more on female health professionals.","Dagne, Henok; Atnafu, Asmamaw; Alemu, Kassahun; Azale, Telake; Yitayih, Sewbesew; Dagnew, Baye; Maru Alemayehu, Abiy; Andualem, Zewudu; Mequanent Sisay, Malede; Tadesse, Demewoz; Hailu Chekol, Soliyana; Mengistu Mamo, Eyerusalem; Simegn, Wudneh",PLoS One,423,20

OBJECTIVES: This study aims to examine ways in which COVID-19 has affected the bereavement experiences of parents whose children died from cancer prior to the pandemic. METHODS: Parents who participated in a survey-based study examining the early grief experience were invited to complete a semi-structured interview. During the interview, which focused on examining the current support for parents and other family members within the first several years following the child's death, participants were asked how COVID-19 has impacted their life and bereavement. RESULTS: Fifteen of thirty-three eligible parents completed the interview; 14 were White and non-Hispanic, 5 were male. Parents participated an average of 19 (range 12-34) months after their child's death. COVID-19 was addressed in 13 interviews. Eleven codes were used to describe interview segments; the most commonly used codes were 'change in support,' 'no effect, 'familiarity with uncertainty/ability to cope' and 'change in contact with care/research team.' CONCLUSION: Parents identified multiple and variable ways - both positive, negative and neutral - how COVID-19 has affected their bereavement. While many parents commented on feeling more isolated because of the inability to connect with family or attend in-person support groups, others acknowledged their experience has made them uniquely positioned to cope with the uncertainty of the current situation. Clinicians must find innovative ways to connect with and support bereaved parents during this unique time.","Helton, Gabrielle; Wolfe, Joanne; Snaman, Jennifer M",J. pain symptom manage,423,33

METHODS: Pooled plasma samples from PCR positive COVID-19 patients were used to identify linear B-cell epitopes from a SARS-CoV-2 peptide library of spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) structural proteins by peptide-based ELISA. Hit epitopes were further validated with 79 COVID-19 patients with different disease severity status, 13 seasonal human CoV, 20 recovered SARS patients and 22 healthy donors. FINDINGS: Four immunodominant epitopes, S14P5, S20P2, S21P2 and N4P5, were identified on the S and N viral proteins. IgG responses to all identified epitopes displayed a strong detection profile, with N4P5 achieving the highest level of specificity (100%) and sensitivity (>96%) against SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the magnitude of IgG responses to S14P5, S21P2 and N4P5 were strongly associated with disease severity. INTERPRETATION: IgG responses to the peptide epitopes can serve as useful indicators for the degree of immunopathology in COVID-19 patients, and function as higly specific and sensitive sero-immunosurveillance tools for recent or past SARS-CoV-2 infections. The flexibility of these epitopes to be used alone or in combination will allow for the development of improved point-of-care-tests (POCTs).

On the other hand, COVID-19 resulted in several hundred thousand deaths since December 2019 and remains without an efficient and safe treatment. The antimalarials chloroquine (CQ) and its analog, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), have been tested for COVID-19 treatment, and several conflicting evidence has been obtained. Therefore, the aim of this review was to summarize the evidence regarding action mechanisms of these compounds against Plasmodium and SARS-CoV-2 infection, together with cytometry applications. CQ and HCQ act on the renin angiotensin system, with possible implications on the cardiorespiratory system. In this context, flow and image cytometry emerge as powerful technologies to investigate the mechanism of therapeutic candidates, as well as for the identification of the immune response and prognostics of disease severity. Data from the large randomized trials support the conclusion that CQ and HCQ do not provide any clinical improvements in disease severity and progression of SARS-CoV-2 patients, as well as they do not present any solid evidence of increased serious side effects. These drugs are safe and effective antimalarials agents, but in SARS-CoV-2 patients, they need further studies in the context of clinical trials. © 2020 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry.","Pillat, Micheli Mainardi; Krüger, Arne; Guimarães, Lara Mendes Ferreira; Lameu, Claudiana; de Souza, Edmarcia Elisa; Wrenger, Carsten; Ulrich, Henning",Cytometry A,423,20

It becomes more important and useful when it can predict the facts about healthcare information. In computer science, machine learning techniques/models can be used to predict important health care facts, further the study of the sentiments related to health care information can also play a significant role in the generation of important information. There are many international and national organizations like United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), World Health Organization (WHO), etc. that publish important healthcare data. These data sets can be used to predict important facts about the disease. Further, the datasets related to sentiments of the people like tweets on Twitter, posts on Facebook, and blogs are useful to study the sentiments of the people on a particular topic. Sentiments related to health care information, diseases, and epidemics are very useful. The study of these sentiments can help make better prediction systems and to generate fruitful health care facts. Further, the real datasets related to infectious diseases like COVID-19 can be used for regression analysis for making predictions regarding the upcoming cases. In this paper, we have presented a survey on the application of different machine learning techniques, that are used in the classification and regression analysis related to health care predictions and the study of sentiments. We have presented a review of major research studies related to healthcare between the years 2010 to 2020.","Singh, Rameshwer Singh Rajeshwar",Materials Today: Proceedings,423,24

But our understanding on consumer behaviors in the use of antibiotics is very limited. This study aims to identify consumer behavior patterns in the use of antibiotics for upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs). METHODS: The study will employ a mixed methods approach based on the ""Capacity & Opportunity & Motivation - Behavior"" (COM-B) framework. The COM-B attributes of consumers in relation to the use of antibiotics will be extracted from a systematic literature review. Semi-structured in-depth interviews will be conducted on 20-25 community residents with URTI symptoms over the past three months to illustrate the meaning and implications of the thematic categories of COM-B attributes for the purpose of measurement development. The measurement instruments will be modified and validated through Delphi consultations with 15 experts and a survey of 300 adult residents in Wuhan. A cross-sectional survey using the finalised measurement instruments will be conducted on 2700 adult residents randomly selected from 18 residential communities across 9 municipalities in 3 provinces in China. Multi-level latent class analyses will be performed to categeorise the respondents based on the indicators measuring the behavioral features (need recognition, information searching, alternative assessment, purchase, use, and post-use evaluation) of consumers in purchasing, consuming and disposing antibiotics for URTIs. Multi-nominal regression analyses will be performed to determine the predictors of different behavior patterns. DISCUSSION: This study aims to classify consumers into distinguished categories of behavior patterns toward the use of antibiotics for URTIs. Such a classification system categories the consumers with similar behavior features into the same group so that better targeted interventions can be developed. The COM-B model adopted in this study can also help us better understand the underlying mechanisms of different behavior patterns of consumers.","Duan, Zhonghong; Liu, Chaojie; Han, Meng; Wang, Dan; Zhang, Xinping; Liu, Chenxi",Res. soc. adm. pharm,423,20

In this longitudinal multi-institutional study, we used multi-omics to identify novel time- and treatment-related immunopathological signatures in children with COVID-19 (n=105) and MIS-C (n=76). pCOVID-19 was characterized by enhanced type I IFN responses, and MIS-C by type II IFN- and NF-{kappa}B dependent responses, matrisome activation, and increased levels of Spike protein. Reduced levels of IL-33 in pCOVID-19, and of CCL22 in MIS-C suggested suppression of Th2 responses. Expansion of TRBV11-2 T-cell clonotypes in MIS-C was associated with inflammation and signatures of T-cell activation, and was reversed by glucocorticoids. The association of MIS-C with the combination of HLA A*02, B*35, C*04 alleles suggests genetic susceptibility. MIS-C B cells showed higher mutation load. Use of IVIG was identified as a confounding factor in the interpretation of autoantibody levels.","Sacco, Keith; Castagnoli, Riccardo; Vakkilainen, Svetlana; Liu, Can; Delmonte, Ottavia M.; Oguz, Cihan; Kaplan, Ian M.; Alehashemi, Sara; Burbelo, Peter D.; Bhuyan, Farzana; Jesus, Adriana A. de; Dobbs, Kerry; Rosen, Lindsey B.; Cheng, Aristine; Shaw, Elana; Vakkilainen, Mikko S.; Pala, Francesca; Lack, Justin; Zhang, Yu; Fink, Danielle; Oikonomou, Vasileios; Snow, Andrew L.; Dalgard, Clifton L.; Chen, Jinguo; Sellers, Brian A.; Sanchez, Gina A.

We aimed to evaluate and compare the positive rate with molecular POC tests and DIAs in detecting influenza virus A, B and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted in 2019-2020. Nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected from adult outpatients with influenza-like illness who visited four hospitals and clinics in Japan. DIAs were performed at each facility. The clinical diagnosis was determined based on the findings of DIAs, history taking, and physical assessment. Molecular POC test and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were performed later. RESULTS: A total of 182 patients were evaluated. The positive rate for influenza virus with molecular POC test was significantly higher than that with DIAs (51.6% versus 40.7%, p = 0.046). In patients who tested positive for influenza virus with only molecular POC test, the presence of influenza virus was confirmed by RT-PCR. In a comparison between the patients who were positive for influenza virus with only molecular POC test and those with both molecular POC test and DIA, the percentage of patients who sought consultation within 18 h after the onset of symptoms was significantly higher in the molecular POC test only group than in the both methods group (70.0% versus 43.2%, p = 0.044).

From systematic imaging experiments we have inferred the formation of a partially polarized antiferroelectric state, with inclusions of structurally distinct ferrielectric domains enclosed by the corresponding phase boundaries. The assignment is strongly supported by optical spectroscopies and density-functional-theory calculations. Enhanced piezoresponse at the ferrielectric/antiferroelectric phase boundary and the ability to manipulate this entity with electric field on the nanoscale expand the existing phenomenology of functional domain walls.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether wearable activity trackers could provide information regarding users' adherence to home confinement policies because of their capacity for seamless and continuous monitoring of individuals' natural activity patterns regardless of their location. METHODS: We analyzed big data from individuals using activity trackers (Withings) that count the wearer's average daily number of steps in a number of representative nations that adopted different modalities of restriction of citizens' activities. RESULTS: Data on the number of steps per day from over 740,000 individuals around the world were analyzed. We demonstrate the physical activity patterns in several representative countries with total, partial, or no home confinement. The decrease in steps per day in regions with strict total home confinement ranged from 25% to 54%. Partial lockdown (characterized by social distancing measures such as school closures, bar and restaurant closures, and cancellation of public meetings but without strict home confinement) does not appear to have a significant impact on people's activity compared to the pre-pandemic period. The absolute level of physical activity under total home confinement in European countries is around twofold that in China. In some countries, such as France and Spain, physical activity started to gradually decrease even before official commitment to lockdown as a result of initial less stringent restriction orders or self-quarantine. However, physical activity began to increase again in the last 2 weeks, suggesting a decrease in compliance with confinement orders. CONCLUSIONS: Aggregate analysis of activity tracker data with the potential for daily updates can provide information regarding adherence to home confinement policies.","Pépin, Jean Louis; Bruno, Rosa Maria; Yang, Rui-Yi; Vercamer, Vincent; Jouhaud, Paul; Escourrou, Pierre; Boutouyrie, Pierre",J Med Internet Res,423,1

Effectiveness of the triage system was assessed using predetermined criteria.Results Seventy patients were triaged during a 12-week period; 68.5% of patients were managed by the triaging dental nurse without escalation to a dentist and 77% of patients called only once. The most common presenting complaint was pain, followed by loose crown/bridge and fractured crown/tooth/bridge. Sixty-one percent of all patients accepted a face-to-face appointment upon reopening of the dental practice.Conclusions This study demonstrates the effectiveness of a dental nurse-led triage model where dental nurses have the skills and experience required to manage patients at first contact. This model would be applicable to other practices in the case of future emergency closures, as well as a routine out-of-hours service.","Cowell, Angela; Goodwin, Louise; Hare, Katherine; Campbell, Colin",Br. dent. j,423,26

Multiple Facebook groups have been formed by medical professionals, laypeople, and engineering or technical groups to discuss current issues and possible solutions to the current medical crisis. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to characterize Facebook groups formed by laypersons, medical professionals, and technical professionals, with specific focus on information dissemination and requests for crowdsourcing. METHODS: Facebook was queried for user-created groups with the keywords ""COVID,"" ""Coronavirus,"" and ""SARS-CoV-2"" at a single time point on March 31, 2020. The characteristics of each group were recorded, including language, privacy settings, security requirements to attain membership, and membership type. For each membership type, the group with the greatest number of members was selected, and in each of these groups, the top 100 posts were identified using Facebook's algorithm. Each post was categorized and characterized (evidence-based, crowd-sourced, and whether the poster self-identified). STATA (version 13 SE, Stata Corp) was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Our search yielded 257 COVID-19-related Facebook groups. Majority of the groups (n=229, 89%) were for laypersons, 26 (10%) were for medical professionals, and only 2 (1%) were for technical professionals. The number of members was significantly greater in medical groups (21,215, SD 35,040) than in layperson groups (7623, SD 19,480) (P<.01). Medical groups were significantly more likely to require security checks to attain membership (81% vs 43%; P<.001) and less likely to be public (3 vs 123; P<.001) than layperson groups. Medical groups had the highest user engagement, averaging 502 (SD 633) reactions (P<.01) and 224 (SD 311) comments (P<.01) per post. Medical professionals were more likely to use the Facebook groups for education and information sharing, including academic posts (P<.001), idea sharing (P=.003), resource sharing (P=.02) and professional opinions (P<.001), and requesting for crowdsourcing (P=.003). Layperson groups were more likely to share news (P<.001), humor and motivation (P<.001), and layperson opinions (P<.001). There was no significant difference in the number of evidence-based posts among the groups (P=.10). CONCLUSIONS: Medical professionals utilize Facebook groups as a forum to facilitate collective intelligence (CI) and are more likely to use Facebook groups for education and information sharing, including academic posts, idea sharing, resource sharing, and professional opinions, which highlights the power of social media to facilitate CI across geographic distances. Layperson groups were more likely to share news, humor, and motivation, which suggests the utilization of Facebook groups to provide comedic relief as a coping mechanism. Further investigations are necessary to study Facebook groups' roles in facilitating CI, crowdsourcing, education, and community-building.","Xun, Helen; He, Waverley; Chen, Jonlin; Sylvester, Scott; Lerman, Sheera F; Caffrey, Julie",JMIR Form Res,423,16

Given the endemicity of infections such as malaria, HIV, and tuberculosis (TB) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), it is important to evaluate coinfections with SARS-CoV-2 and their impact on maternal/infant outcomes. Robust research is critically needed to evaluate the effects of the added burden of COVID-19 in pregnancy, to help develop evidence-based policies toward improving maternal and infant outcomes. In this perspective, we briefly review current knowledge on the clinical features of COVID-19 in pregnancy; the risks of preterm birth and cesarean delivery secondary to comorbid severity; the effects of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection on the fetus/neonate; and in utero mother-to-child SARS-CoV-2 transmission. We further highlight the need to conduct multicountry surveillance as well as retrospective and prospective cohort studies across SSA. This will enable assessments of SARS-CoV-2 burden among pregnant African women and improve the understanding of the spectrum of COVID-19 manifestations in this population, which may be living with or without HIV, TB, and/or other coinfections/comorbidities. In addition, multicountry studies will allow a better understanding of risk factors and outcomes to be compared across countries and subregions.

This article takes a deeper dive into a series of surveys conducted in Canada that covered a wide range of topics, from trade and investment to international leadership. Two broad conclusions follow. First, public perceptions of China are much more nuanced and conflicted than can be quickly gleaned from the simple dichotomy of ""favorable versus unfavorable,"" especially as one moves from overall impressions to more specific policy issues. Second, misperceptions of China are widespread and may be difficult to overcome, especially among those who already view China negatively. At a time when countries around the world are grappling with the rise of China and its expanding global footprint, failure to account for these features in public opinion about China may lead to misguided policies.

It included close-ended questions about the impact of the pandemic on the rheumatology activities, including outpatient visits and hospitalizations (in percentage, 100% corresponds to complete suspension) and open-ended questions about unmet needs. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the predictors of impact. Suggestions were developed to improve the practice. RESULTS: A total of 858 rheumatologists were included in the analysis (27.3% of registered in ArLAR), 37% were 35-44 years old, 60% were females, and 48% worked in the private sector. The impact of COVID-19 was a decrease of 69% in hospitalizations, 65% in outpatient clinic, 56% in infusion centers, and 43% in income. It was associated with the region (highest in the Gulf), use of telemedicine, impact on income and practice sector (lowest in private). There was a hydroxychloroquine shortage in 47%. Telemedicine was mostly based on traditional telephone contacts and e-mails and reimbursed in 12%. Fifteen rheumatologists (1.8%) were infected and 156 cases of COVID-19 were reported among patients. The top-cited unmet needs in rheumatology practice were access to drugs and a telemedicine platform. CONCLUSIONS: The negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on rheumatology practice may compromise rheumatic diseases control. Better access to drugs and providing telemedicine platforms are recommended to improve the practice. Key Points â¢ The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant negative impact on the rheumatology practice, including access to outpatient clinic, hospitalization, and to anchor drugs. â¢ The compromised access to rheumatology care may jeopardize the control of chronic rheumatic diseases and the long-term prognosis. â¢ Better access to drugs and providing telemedicine platforms are strongly recommended.","Ziadé, Nelly; Hmamouchi, Ihsane; El Kibbi, Lina; Abdulateef, Nizar; Halabi, Hussein; Abutiban, Fatemah; Hamdi, Wafa; El Rakawi, Manal; Eissa, Mervat; Masri, Basel",Clin Rheumatol,423,20

METHODS: We describe telemedicine onboarding and utilization across a statewide oncology practice, covering 221 sites of service and more than 650 practitioners. We describe qualitatively the onboarding process of a diverse set of administrative, technical, and clinical partners. We describe quantitatively utilization throughout the practice. We describe a survey conducted to enlighten barriers and opportunities for optimal utilization. RESULTS: Multistakeholder education was directed to clinical teams, administrative and technical support staff, and patients through webinars and team meetings. Utilization was high from April through October 2020, representing 15% to 20% of new-patient visits and 20% to 25% of established-patient visits. In a survey offered to all clinicians, 96% of respondents indicated they are using telemedicine, with 33% using it for more than 25% of patient encounters. Among respondents, 59% reported that the use of telemedicine helps expedite diagnosis and treatment more than seeing patients in person in the clinic, 55% of respondents managed urgent issues by telemedicine, 80% believed that patients benefited From urgent assessment by telemedicine, and 57% believed an emergency department visit or a hospitalization was avoided because of a telemedicine visit. Most clinicians reported that patients enjoy benefits of telemedicine because of decreased exposure risk, decreased transportation requirements, and ease of including caregivers in the visit with the treating clinician. The most common barriers to patients accessing telemedicine were technical challenges and broadband access. Despite this, less than 5% of respondents routinely use telephone-only communication, as most typically use bimodal audio/video communication. Many clinicians have expansion ideas on how telemedicine can further expand the longitudinal care delivery for our patient population. CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine can be implemented successfully across a large statewide oncology practice and service a high volume of patients. Clinicians utilize telemedicine for new and established patients with minimal dysfunction. Clinicians believe patients benefit From telemedicine For new, established, and urgent care visits. Broadband access functionality should be explored to optimally serve our patient population.","Patt, Debra; Wilfong, Lalan; Kanipe, Kristen; Paulson, R Steven",Am J Manag Care,423,1

The purpose of this study is to describe the dental management of patients undergoing pre-HSCT examination with the Dental Service at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) and to report on odontogenic complications. METHODS: Patients referred for evaluation as part of the standard preparation for HSCT were included. Following clinical and radiological examination, patients were assigned to one of three groups based on risk of odontogenic infection, and treatment was provided as indicated. Patients were followed, and their medical records were reviewed for odontogenic complications during the transplant admission. RESULTS: Of the 375 patients evaluated, 350 patients underwent HSCT: allogeneic 143 (40.9%) and autologous 207 (59.1%). The distribution of primary cancer diagnosis was as follows: multiple myeloma 104 (29.7%), leukemias 95 (27.1%), Hodgkin's lymphoma 28 (8.0%), non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma 99 (28.3%), and other conditions 24 (6.9%). The median time from dental evaluation to transplant was 29 days. The median Decayed, Missing, Filled Teeth Index was 17. The median Community Periodontal Index was 1. Based on dental status, 145 patients (41.4%) were classified as low risk, 133 (38%) as moderate risk and 72 (20.6%) as high risk of odontogenic infection. One hundred fourteen patients (32.6%) required dental treatment prior to HSCT, and 100 of these (28.6%) completed treatment. Two (0.57%) patients had odontogenic complications. CONCLUSIONS: With conservative pre-HSCT dental treatment based on an infection risk classification system, a low odontogenic complication rate was observed.","Hansen, Heidi J; Estilo, Cherry; Owosho, Adepitan; Solano, Armand Karl; Randazzo, Joseph; Huryn, Joseph; Yom, SaeHee K",Support. care cancer,423,3

However, the impact of the pandemic on the use of complementary and alternative medicine remains unknown. METHODS: This retrospective study aimed to analyze the changes in the number of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) patients and examine the epidemic prevention policy during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We analyzed the number of TCM patients in Taipei City Hospital from January 2017 to May 2020. We tallied the numbers of patients in each month and compared them with those in the same months last year. We calculated the percentage difference in the number of patients to reveal the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on TCM utilization. We used the Mann-Whitney U test to examine whether there was a significant difference in the number of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: We included a total of 1,935,827 TCM visits of patients from January 2017 to May 2020 in this study. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of patients decreased significantly, except in February 2020. The number of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic had fallen by more than 15% compared with those in the same months last year. March and April had the greatest number of patient losses, with falls of 32.8 and 40% respectively. TCM patients declined significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic, and mobile medicine provided to rural areas fell considerably. Among all the TCM specialties, pediatrics and traumatology, as well as infertility treatment, witnessed the most significant decline in the number of patients. However, the number of cancer patients has reportedly increased. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic decreased the utilization rate of TCM, especially for mobile healthcare in rural areas. We suggest that the government pay attention to the medical disparity between urban and rural areas, which are affected by the pandemic, as well as allocate adequate resources in areas deprived of medical care.","Lin, Shun-Ku; Wu, Chien-Tung; Chou, Hui-Jer; Liu, Chia-Jen; Ko, Fu-Yang; Huang, Ching-Hsuan; Lai, Jung-Nien",BMC Complement Med Ther,423,22

In particular, we define several notions of randomness associated with interval, rather than precise, forecasting systems, and study their properties. The richer mathematical structure that thus arises lets us, amongst other things, better understand and place existing results for the precise limit. When we focus on constant interval forecasts, we find that every sequence of binary outcomes has an associated filter of intervals it is random for. It may happen that none of these intervals is precise -- a single real number -- which justifies the title of this paper. We illustrate this by showing that randomness associated with non-stationary precise forecasting systems can be captured by a constant interval forecast, which must then be less precise: a gain in model simplicity is thus paid for by a loss in precision. But imprecise randomness can't always be explained away as a result of oversimplification: we show that there are sequences that are random for a constant interval forecast, but never random for any {\comp} (more) precise forecasting system. We also show that the set of sequences that are random for a non-vacuous interval forecasting system is meagre, as it is for precise forecasting systems.","Cooman, Gert de; Bock, Jasper De",,423,16

Our narrative review aims to determine whether the diagnosis of pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) in COVID-19 patients represents coinfection or colonization based on the evidence available in the literature. We also discuss the decision to treat COVID-19 patients with coinfection by PJP. METHODS: A literature search was performed through the Pubmed and Web of Science databases from inception to March 10, 2021. RESULTS: We identified 12 COVID-19 patients suspected to have PJP coinfection. All patients were critically ill and required mechanical ventilation. Many were immunosuppressed from HIV or long-term corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive agents. In both the HIV and non-HIV groups, severe lymphocytopenia was encountered with absolute lymphocyte and CD4+T cell count less than 900 and 200 cells/mm, respectively. The time to PJP diagnosis from the initial presentation was 7.8 (range 2-21) days. Serum lactate dehydrogenase and beta-D-glucan were elevated in those coinfected with PJP. All patients were treated with anti-PJP therapy, predominantly sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim with corticosteroids. The overall mortality rate was 41.6%, and comparable for both HIV and non-HIV groups. CONCLUSION: As the current evidence is restricted to case reports, the true incidence, risk factors, and prognosis of COVID-19 patients with PJP coinfections cannot be accurately determined. Comorbidities of poorly controlled HIV with lymphocytopenia and multiple immunosuppressive therapies are likely predisposing factors for PJP coinfection.","Chong, Woon H; Saha, Biplab K; Chopra, Amit",Infection,423,32

Therefore, we sought to determine whether other antioxidants might behave like vitamin C in causing falsely elevated blood glucose levels, potentially exposing patients to glycemic mismanagement by being administered harmful doses of glucose-lowering drugs. To determine whether various antioxidants can be detected by seven commercial glucose meters, human blood samples were spiked with various antioxidants ex vivo and their effect on the glucose results were assessed by Parkes error grid analysis. Several of the glucose meters demonstrated a positive bias in the glucose measurement of blood samples spiked with vitamin C, N-acetylcysteine, and glutathione. With the most interference-sensitive glucose meter, non-blood solutions of 1 mmol/L N-acetylcysteine, glutathione, cysteine, vitamin C, dihydrolipoate, and dithiothreitol mimicked the results seen on that glucose meter for 0.7, 1.0, 1.2, 2.6, 3.7 and 5.5 mmol/L glucose solutions, respectively. Glucose meter users should be alerted that some of these devices might produce spurious glucose results not only in patients on vitamin C therapy but also in those being administered other antioxidants. As discussed herein, the clinical relevance of the data is immediate in view of the current use of antioxidant therapies for disorders such as the metabolic syndrome, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and coronavirus disease 2019.","Grzych, Guillaume; Pekar, Jean-David; Chevalier-Curt, Marie Joncquel; Decoin, Raphaël; Vergriete, Pauline; Henry, Héloïse; Odou, Pascal; Maboudou, Patrice; Brousseau, Thierry; Vamecq, Joseph",Clin Biochem,423,20

Drawing on STS, we start from the theoretical assumption that examinations constitute an obligatory passage point in universities and colleges: a sacred point which students need to pass if they want to gain recognized qualifications. We base our analysis of higher education examinations on cases from six countries around the world: Australia, Belgium, Chile, India, Sweden and the UK. We use the analytical heuristic of choreography to follow the movements, tensions and resistance of the ?emergency examinations? as well as the re-orderings of actors and stages that have inevitably occurred. In our analytical stories we see the interplay between the maintenance of fixed and sacred aspects of examinations and the fluidity of improvisations aimed at meeting threats of spreading Covid-19. These measures have forced the complex network of examinations both to reinforce some conventional actors and to assemble new actors and stages, thus creating radically new choreographies. Although higher education teaching and didactics are being framed as a playground for pedagogical innovation with digital technologies, it is clear from our data that not all educational activities can be so easily replicated.","Alarcón López, Cristina Decuypère Mathias Dey Joyeeta Gorur Radhika Hamilton Mary Lundahl Christian Sundström Sjödin Elin",European Educational Research Journal,423,6

PATIENTS & METHODS: Retrospective multicentre observational study conducted in 4 centres treating haematological malignancies across Delhi-national capital region. Total 33 haematological malignancies patients with severe Covid-19 who received CPT were analysed. RESULTS: The median age of the study cohort was 62 years (18-80 years). Twenty one percent patients had 1 comorbidity, 18 % had 2 comorbidities and 6% patients had 3 and 5 comorbidities each. Twenty four patients were on active therapy. Sixty nine percent of patients required ICU stay. Twenty five patients received plasma therapy within 7 days (early) of diagnosis of Covid-19 infection. Median day of plasma infusion from date of diagnosis of Covid-19 infection was 4 days (range: 2-25 days). Patient who had early initiation of plasma therapy had shorter duration of hospitalisation (12.7 vs 24.3 days, p = 0.000). Overall mortality in the cohort was 45.5%.

Prior research suggests starting a new job is an uncertain experience; we theorize that the COVID-19 pandemic creates additional environmental stressors that affect new hire engagement. First, we hypothesize that the occurrence of COVID-19 and unemployment rates relate negatively to engagement. Second, we theorize that the effects of the pandemic become more disruptive on new hire engagement as they gain tenure within the organization. Third, drawing from strategic management theory, we test whether States that introduce stronger COVID-19 policies help enhance the engagement of new hires. Examining a U.S. national sample of 12,577 newly hired (90 days or less) quick service restaurant employees across 9 months (January-September, 2020), we find support for these hypotheses. Subsequent model comparisons suggest there may be health stressors that shape engagement more strongly than purely economic stressors. These findings may be important because they highlight the experiences of workers more likely to be exposed to the pandemic and affected by COVID-related policies. Should the results generalize to other samples and jobs, this study offers potentially new research directions for understanding relationships between macro stressors and new hire perceptions and socialization. It also offers practical implications by helping organizations understand the importance of explicitly managing job insecurity, particularly in terms of COVID-19 policy.

METHODS: In this retrospective study, we included 3232 patients with pathogen-confirmed COVID-19 who were hospitalized between January 18th and March 27th, 2020, at Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China. Propensity score matching was used to minimize selection bias. RESULTS: In total, 2665 patients with complete clinical outcomes were analyzed. The impacts of age, sex, and comorbidities were evaluated separately using binary logistic regression analysis. The results showed that age, sex, and cancer history are independent risk factors for mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 patients with cancer exhibited a significant increase in mortality rate (29.4% vs. 10.2%, P < 0.0001). Furthermore, the clinical outcomes of patients with hematological malignancies were worse, with a mortality rate twice that of patients with solid tumors (50% vs. 26.1%). Importantly, cancer patients with complications had a significantly higher risk of poor outcomes. One hundred nine cancer patients were matched to noncancer controls in a 1:3 ratio by propensity score matching. After propensity score matching, the cancer patients still had a higher risk of mortality than the matched noncancer patients (odds ratio (OR) 2.98, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.76-5.06). Additionally, elevations in ferritin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, procalcitonin, prothrombin time, interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were observed in cancer patients. CONCLUSIONS: We evaluated prognostic factors with epidemiological analysis and highlighted a higher risk of mortality for cancer patients with COVID-19. Importantly, cancer history was the only independent risk factor for COVID-19 among common comorbidities, while other comorbidities may act through other factors. Moreover, several laboratory parameters were significantly different between cancer patients and matched noncancer patients, which may indicate specific immune and inflammatory reactions in COVID-19 patients with cancer.","Meng, Yifan; Lu, Wanrong; Guo, Ensong; Liu, Jia; Yang, Bin; Wu, Ping; Lin, Shitong; Peng, Ting; Fu, Yu; Li, Fuxia; Wang, Zizhuo; Li, Yuan; Xiao, Rourou; Liu, Chen; Huang, Yuhan; Lu, Funian; Wu, Xue; You, Lixin; Ma, Ding; Sun, Chaoyang; Wu, Peng; Chen, Gang",J Hematol Oncol,423,1

Glioblastoma (GBM) patients are among the most vulnerable due to increased incidence in the elderly and the short survival time. A virtual meeting was convened on May 9, 2020 with a panel of neuro-oncology experts with experience using Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields). The objective was to assess the risk-to-benefit ratio and provide guidance for using TTFields in GBM during the COVID-19 pandemic. Panel Discussion: Topics discussed included support and delivery of TTFields during the COVID-19 pandemic, concomitant use of TTFields with chemotherapy, and any potential impact of TTFields on the immune system in an intrinsically immunosuppressed GBM population. Special consideration was given to TTFields' use in elderly patients and in combination with radiotherapy regimens. Finally, the panel discussed the need to better capture data on COVID-19positive brain tumor patients to analyze longitudinal outcomes and changes in treatment decision-making during the pandemic. Expert Opinion: TTFields is a portable home-use device which can be managed via telemedicine and safely used in GBM patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. TTFields has no known immunosuppressive effects which is important during a crisis where other treatment methods might be limited, especially for elderly patients with multiple co-morbidities.

While long-term studies on the correlates of protection, vaccine effectiveness, and enhanced surveillance are awaited, studies on breakthrough infections help us understand the nature and course of this illness among vaccinated individuals and guide in public health preparedness. MethodsThis observational cohort study aimed at comparing the differences in clinical, biochemical parameters and the hospitalization outcomes of 53 fully vaccinated individuals with those of unvaccinated (1,464) and partially vaccinated (231) individuals, among a cohort of 2,080 individuals hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection. ResultsCompleting the course of vaccination protected individuals from developing severe COVID-19 as evidence by lower proportions of those with hypoxia, abnormal levels of inflammatory markers, requiring ventilatory support and death compared to unvaccinated and partially vaccinated individuals. There were no differences in these outcomes among patients who received either vaccine type approved in India. ConclusionWith a current rate of only 9.5% of the Indian population being fully vaccinated, efforts should be made to improve the vaccination rates as a timely measure to prepare for the upcoming waves of this highly transmissible pandemic. Vaccination rates of the communities may also guide in the planning of the health needs and appropriate use of medical resources. Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThe Government of India started vaccinating its citizens from the 16th of January 2021, after emergency use authorization had been received for the use of two vaccines, BBV152, a COVID-19 vaccine based on the whole-virion SARS-CoV-2 vaccine strain NIV-2020-770, (Covaxin) and the recombinant replication-deficient chimpanzee adenovirus vector encoding the spike protein ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 Corona Virus Vaccine (Covishield). These have been approved by the Indian regulatory authority based on randomized controlled studies. In these studies, was found that the vaccines led to more than 90% reduction in symptomatic COVID-19 disease. However, there is scarce evidence of the efficacy of these vaccines in real-world scenarios. A few studies have looked at vaccinated cohorts such as health care workers in whom the vaccines had an efficacy similar to the RCTs. In a study of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to a tertiary care hospital in New Delhi, it was found that mortality in fully vaccinated patients was 12.5% as compared to 31.5% in the unvaccinated cohort. Added-value of this studyThis cohort of hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection was studied during the peak of the second wave of COVID-19 in India during which the delta variant of concern was the predominant infecting strain and had 26% patients who were partially vaccinated and 71.4% who were unvaccinated. Only 3% of the patients were fully vaccinated and developed a breakthrough infection. At the time of presentation, 13% of the individuals with breakthrough infection and 48{middle dot}5% in the non-vaccinated group were hypoxic. Inflammatory markers were significantly lower in the completely vaccinated patients with breakthrough infection. The need for use of steroids and anti-viral agents such as remdesivir was also significantly low in the breakthrough infection group. A significantly less proportion of the individuals with breakthrough infection required oxygen supplementation or ventilatory support. Very few deteriorated or progressed to critical illness during their hospital stay. Only 3 individuals (5.7%) out of the 53 who developed breakthrough infection succumbed to illness while case fatality rates were significantly higher in the unvaccinated (22.8%) and partially vaccinated (19.5%) groups. Propensity score weighted multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed lower odds of developing hypoxia, critical illness or death in those who were completely vaccinated. Implications of all the available evidenceThe real-world effectiveness of the vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 seems to be similar to the randomized controlled trials. The vaccines are very effective in reducing the incidence of severe COVID-19, hypoxia, critical illness and death. The reduced need for oxygen supplementation, mechanical ventilation and the requirement of corticosteroids or other expensive medications such as anti-viral drugs could go a long way in redistributing scarce health care resources. All nations must move forward and vaccinate the citizens, as the current evidence suggests that prevention is better than cure.","Sagiraju, Hari Krishna Raju; Elavarasi, Arunmozhimaran; Gupta, Nishkarsh; Kumar, Rohit; Paul, Saurav Sekhar; Vig, Saurabh; Sirohiya, Prashant; Ratre, Brajesh; Garg, Rakesh; Pandit, Anuja; Nalwa, Ram; Kumar, Balbir; Meena, Ved Prakash; Wig, Naveet; Mittal, Saurabh; Pahuja, Sourabh; Madan, Karan; Das, Nupur; Dwivedi, Tanima; Gupta, Ritu; Wundavalli, Laxmitej; Singh, Angel R; Singh, Sheetal; Mishra, Abhinav; Matharoo, Karanvir Singh; Manisha,; Kumar, Sunil; Mohan, Anant; Guleria, Randeep; Bhatnagar, Sushma",,423,24

Meanwhile, few studies focused on the midterm sequelae, which still remain largely unknown. AIM: To assess the physical performance of COVID-19 survivors at 3 to 6 months from Hospital discharge. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study focused on mid-term functional outcomes evaluation in COVID-19 survivors. SETTING: Outpatients who had been previously hospitalized due to COVID-19 from March to May 2020 at the University Hospital of Novara, Italy. POPULATION: We enrolled 204 patients, of which 60% were men, with the mean age of 57.9 years. METHODS: Patients firstly underwent the short physical performance battery test (SPPB), which is composed of a series of physical tests assessing the lower limb function and the functional status of the subjects. Subsequently, based on SPPB results, patients' cardiorespiratory fitness performance was further investigated. Patients with normal SPPB score (SPPB>10) underwent the 2-minute walking test (2MWT) whereas, in order to safely test the cardiorespiratory function, in patients with abnormal SPPB score (SPPB&#8804;10) the 1-minute sit-to-stand test (1MSTST) was performed. It should be noted that the 1MSTST can be safely performed even by subjects with compromised walking ability. RESULTS: Overall, 66 patients (32% of our sample) showed an impaired physical performance at 3 to 6 months after hospital discharge. In particular, 29 patients presented an SPPB score &#8804;10, and the 1MSTST confirmed this status in the whole group (100%) compared to the reference values for age and sex. Besides, among patients with a normal SPPB score, 37 showed a lower sex- and age-matched 2MWT score. Finally, a significant association between Intensive Care Unit hospitalization or mechanical ventilation and physical impairment was observed together with a significant association between the walking ability (measured with SPPB and 2MWT) and the number of comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: A residual physical and functional impairment was observed in COVID-19 survivors at mid-term evaluation after hospitalization.

Second, factors associated with poor knowledge. RESULTS: Of the 3586 participants, 2444 (68.2%) were female, 1822 (50.8%) were unemployed and 2839 (79.2%) were college educated. The study revealed good awareness regarding COVID-19 (mean 75.6%, SD ±9.4%). Multiple linear regression analysis correlated poor mean knowledge scores with male gender (ß=-0.933, p=0.005), secondary school or lower education level (ß=-3.782, p<0.001), non-healthcare occupation (ß=-3.592, p<0.001), low economic status (ß=-0.669, p<0.040) and >5 household members (ß=-1.737, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: This study revealed some potentially troubling knowledge gaps which underscore the need for a vigorous public education campaign in Syria. This campaign must reinforce the public's awareness, knowledge and vigilance towards precautionary measures against COVID-19, and most importantly aid in controlling the worldwide spread of the disease.","Mohsen, Fatema; Bakkar, Batoul; Armashi, Humam; Aldaher, Nizar",BMJ Open,423,16

Short lengths of stay raise the possibility of mother-infant dyads being less ready for discharge, defined as at least one of the three informants (i.e., mother, pediatrician, and obstetrician) believing that either the mother and/or infant should stay longer than the proposed time of discharge. This public health crisis has reduced the number of in-person well child visits, negatively impacting vaccine receipt, and anticipatory guidance. RECENT FINDINGS: Extra precautions should be taken during the transition period between postpartum discharge and follow-up in the ambulatory setting to ensure the safety of all patients and practice team members. This should include restructuring office flow by visit type and location, limiting in-person visits during well infant exams, instituting proper procedures for personal protective equipment and for cleaning of the office, expanding telehealth capabilities for care and education, and prioritizing universal vaccinations and routine well child screenings. SUMMARY: Based on current limited evidence, this report provides guidance for the postdischarge management of newborns born to mothers with confirmed or suspected disease in the ambulatory setting as well as prioritizing universal immunizations and routine well child screenings during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Harriel, Katherine L; Nolt, Dawn; Moore, Scot; Kressly, Susan; Bernstein, Henry Hank",Curr Opin Pediatr,423,20

The assays were performed using serum samples of three group patients, i.e., healthy controls, patients with SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive, and patients with SARS-CoV-2 PCR negative clinically diagnosed of COVID-19 infection. The detection percentages of IgG with the StrongStep® SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM kit and AllTest COV-19 IgG/IgM kit were similar in both groups (83.3% and 80.6%, respectively in group 2, p = 0.766) and (42.9% and 50.0%, respectively in group 3, p = 0.706).

Two predominant subclades within the B.1.526 lineage have been identified, one containing the E484K mutation in the receptor-binding domain (1,2), which attenuates in vitro neutralization by multiple SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and is present in variants of concern (VOCs) first identified in South Africa (B.1.351) (4) and Brazil (P.1).* The NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) analyzed laboratory and epidemiologic data to characterize cases of B.1.526 infection, including illness severity, transmission to close contacts, rates of possible reinfection, and laboratory-diagnosed breakthrough infections among vaccinated persons. Preliminary data suggest that the B.1.526 variant does not lead to more severe disease and is not associated with increased risk for infection after vaccination (breakthrough infection) or reinfection. Because relatively few specimens were sequenced over the study period, the statistical power might have been insufficient to detect modest differences in rates of uncommon outcomes such as breakthrough infection or reinfection. Collection of timely viral genomic data for a larger proportion of citywide cases and rapid integration with population-based surveillance data would enable improved understanding of the impact of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and specific mutations to help guide public health intervention efforts.","Thompson, Corinne N; Hughes, Scott; Ngai, Stephanie; Baumgartner, Jennifer; Wang, Jade C; McGibbon, Emily; Devinney, Katelynn; Luoma, Elizabeth; Bertolino, Daniel; Hwang, Christina; Kepler, Kelsey; Del Castillo, Cybill; Hopkins, Melissa; Lee, Henry; DeVito, Andrea K; Rakeman, Jennifer L; Fine, Anne D",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,423,16

With the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, kindergarten through grade 12 physical school campuses closed, which led to those programs transitioning to emergency feeding. The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction has 4 action priorities that guided the assessment of school nutrition employees' emergency response during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to explore the experience of school nutrition employees as they provided emergency feeding services during the COVID-19 pandemic and evaluate their actions based on the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction . DESIGN: A qualitative study with semi-structured interviews (n = 34) was conducted via videoconferencing software. A purposive sample of school nutrition employees across all 7 US Department of Agriculture regions who were involved in the COVID-19 emergency feeding response participated during April and May 2020. PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: School nutrition employees were selected randomly for participation from those indicating willingness to be interviewed during their participation in a related survey. Recruitment continued until all 7 US Department of Agriculture regions were represented. Participants held various roles, ranging from state agency leaders to front-line supervisors, although most were district-level directors or assistant directors. ANALYSIS: Data were analyzed using a phenomenological qualitative analytic approach. RESULTS: Four themes emerged. First, participants described the progression of the initial shock associated with the pandemic and service disruption, the flexibility they practiced, and the development of new routines. Second, keeping people (children, coworkers, and the community) safe was highlighted. The next theme captured participants' feeling that they came ""out of the shadows"" as communities and stakeholders recognized their important contribution to children's food security. Finally, they shared insight on communication and accountability during the emergency feeding response. CONCLUSIONS: These programs demonstrated flexibility, resilience, and commitment to children during this crisis. As the pandemic continues and future disasters are considered, school nutrition programs and leaders can use the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction's ""build back better"" concept to refine disaster preparedness plans and advocate for changes that will continue to combat child food insecurity in the United States.","Patten, Emily Vaterlaus; Spruance, Lori; Vaterlaus, J Mitchell; Jones, Mckenna; Beckstead, Emma",Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics,423,23

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, South Africa implemented a nationwide lockdown as confirmed cases continued to rise. Understanding the impact of COVID-19 on SLPs has a three-fold purpose: to re-evaluate service provision, service delivery platforms and to identify the need for support to SLPs during a time of crisis. It is also crucial in guiding how policies and interventions need to be modified. OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to better understand how the workspace of SLPs in hospitals was impacted by COVID-19, how they experienced this process and the implications for them as healthcare professionals in both the private and public sector throughout South Africa. METHODOLOGY: An exploratory cross-sectional study design was used to meet the aims of the study. Thirty-nine SLPs from different provinces in South Africa, working in government and private hospitals during COVID-19, responded to the online survey. Results were analysed using descriptive statistics and thematic content analysis. RESULTS: SLPs' roles, responsibilities and service delivery were impacted by COVID-19. It was necessary for typical outpatient therapy services to be modified; there were changes to the role of the SLP in the hospital and inpatient services were curtailed. CONCLUSION: This study provides insightful information to SLPs employed in hospitals to know that they are experiencing similar challenges. It also confirms the resilience of healthcare professionals, including SLPs, when faced with novel and unprecedented situations.","Adams, Skye N; Seedat, Jaishika; Coutts, Kim; Kater, Kelly-Ann",S Afr J Commun Disord,423,17

STUDY DESIGN: This prospective cohort study included all delivering patients between May 1 and September 22, 2020 at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics. Plasma SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing was performed. SARS-CoV-2 viral reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results and maternal and neonatal outcomes were collected from the electronic medical record. Data were analyzed using univariate statistical methods with clustering for multiple births. RESULTS: In total, 1,000 patients delivered between May 1 and September 22, 2020. Fifty-eight (5.8%) were SARS-CoV-2 antibody positive. Twenty-three also tested viral positive during pregnancy. Three of 1,000 (0.3%) were viral positive on admission but antibody negative. The median age was 30 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 26-33 years) and body mass index was 31.75 kg/m2 (IQR 27.7-37.5 kg/m2). The cesarean delivery rate was 34.0%. The study population was primarily white (71.6%); however, 41.0% of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients identified as Black, 18.0% as Hispanic/Latino, 3.3% as Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, and only 27.9% as White (p < 0.0001). SARS-CoV-2 infection was more likely in patients without private insurance (p = 0.0243). Adverse maternal and/or neonatal outcomes were not more likely in patients with evidence of infection during pregnancy. Two SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were admitted to the intensive care unit. There were no maternal deaths during the study period. CONCLUSION: In this largely rural Midwest population, 6.1% of delivering patients had evidence of past or current SARS-CoV-2 infection. Rates of SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy were higher among racial and ethnic minorities and patients without private insurance. The SARS-CoV-2 infected patients and their neonates were not found to be at increased risk for adverse outcomes.

The patient was screened and tested positive for COVID 19 due to his employment in Wuhan, China at the COVID-19 pandemic epicenter. The patient was subsequently taken for open sigmoid colonic resection, however the case presented multiple challenges due to the patient's COVID-19 positive status. DISCUSSION: The challenges of surgical management of COVID-19 positive patients exist are four-fold. First the unknown efficacy of pre-surgical risk stratification in COVID-19 positive patients, second the risk of aerosolized COVID-19 transmission during intubation for surgery, third the risk of fecal COVID-19 transmission to surgical staff during large bowel resection, and fourth the post-operative challenges of caring for COVID-19 positive patients.

Constraints in vaccine supply and distribution capacity, together with a deadly wave of COVID-19 from November 2020 to January 2021 and the emergence of highly contagious Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants, sparked a policy debate on whether to vaccinate more individuals with the first dose of available vaccines and delay the second dose or to continue with the recommended 2-dose series as tested in clinical trials. We developed an agent-based model of COVID-19 transmission to compare the impact of these 2 vaccination strategies, while varying the temporal waning of vaccine efficacy following the first dose and the level of preexisting immunity in the population. Our results show that for Moderna vaccines, a delay of at least 9 weeks could maximize vaccination program effectiveness and avert at least an additional 17.3 (95% credible interval [CrI]: 7.8-29.7) infections, 0.69 (95% CrI: 0.52-0.97) hospitalizations, and 0.34 (95% CrI: 0.25-0.44) deaths per 10,000 population compared to the recommended 4-week interval between the 2 doses. Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines also averted an additional 0.60 (95% CrI: 0.37-0.89) hospitalizations and 0.32 (95% CrI: 0.23-0.45) deaths per 10,000 population in a 9-week delayed second dose (DSD) strategy compared to the 3-week recommended schedule between doses. However, there was no clear advantage of delaying the second dose with Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines in reducing infections, unless the efficacy of the first dose did not wane over time. Our findings underscore the importance of quantifying the characteristics and durability of vaccine-induced protection after the first dose in order to determine the optimal time interval between the 2 doses.","Moghadas, Seyed M; Vilches, Thomas N; Zhang, Kevin; Nourbakhsh, Shokoofeh; Sah, Pratha; Fitzpatrick, Meagan C; Galvani, Alison P",PLoS Biol,423,20

In response to the pandemic, the Japanese government launched a universal cash entitlement program offering a sizable lump sum of money to all residents to alleviate the financial burden of the pandemic on households. The timings of cash deposits varied substantially across households due to unexpected delays in administrative procedures. Using a unique panel of 2.8 million bank accounts, we find an immediate jump in spending during the week of payments, followed by moderately elevated levels of spending that persist for more than one month after payments are received. We also document sizable heterogeneity in consumption responses by recipients’ financial status and demographic characteristics. In particular, demand deposit balances play a more crucial role than other financial asset holdings, suggesting the importance of the wealthy hand-to-mouth.","Kubota, So Onishi Koichiro Toyama Yuta",Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization,423,2

Viral replication is shaped by the cellular microenvironment, and one important factor to consider is oxygen tension, in which hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) regulates transcriptional responses to hypoxia. SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects cells of the respiratory tract, entering via its spike glycoprotein binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). We demonstrate that hypoxia and the HIF prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor Roxadustat reduce ACE2 expression and inhibit SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication in lung epithelial cells via an HIF-1&#945;-dependent pathway. Hypoxia and Roxadustat inhibit SARS-CoV-2 RNA replication, showing that post-entry steps in the viral life cycle are oxygen sensitive. This study highlights the importance of HIF signaling in regulating multiple aspects of SARS-CoV-2 infection and raises the potential use of HIF prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors in the prevention or treatment of COVID-19.","Wing, Peter A C; Keeley, Thomas P; Zhuang, Xiaodong; Lee, Jeffrey Y; Prange-Barczynska, Maria; Tsukuda, Senko; Morgan, Sophie B; Harding, Adam C; Argles, Isobel L A; Kurlekar, Samvid; Noerenberg, Marko; Thompson, Craig P; Huang, Kuan-Ying A; Balfe, Peter; Watashi, Koichi; Castello, Alfredo; Hinks, Timothy S C; James, William; Ratcliffe, Peter J; Davis, Ilan; Hodson, Emma J; Bishop, Tammie; McKeating, Jane A",Cell Rep,423,14

To facilitate the management of the pandemic in Italy, it is essential to understand the level of attention on COVID-19. The aim of the study was to evaluate the knowledge, attitude and practices towards SARS-CoV-2 among the nursing students of University of Palermo during the rapid rise period of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The current study was a cross-sectional study. On-line questionnaires were used for the collection of the data by providing a survey in all nursing students. The questionnaire consisted of two parts: demographics and Knowledge, Attitude and Practices (KAP) survey. A multivariate linear regression model was used and adjusted Odds Ratios (aOR) are presented. RESULTS: 525 students were interviewed and their mean age was 21.8. The overall score indicates good practices among the three courses of study (p=0.025).

For this system, the effective self-propelling method, which should be powered wirelessly and controllable in 3-D space, is of paramount importance. This article describes a bubble-powered swimming microdrone that can navigate in 3-D space in a controlled manner. To enable 3-D propulsion with steering capability, air bubbles of three lengths are trapped in microtubes that are embedded and three-dimensionally aligned inside the drone body using two-photon polymerization. These bubbles can generate on-demand 3-D propulsion through microstreaming when they are selectively excited at their individual resonance frequencies that depend on the bubble sizes. In order to equip the drone with highly stable maneuverability, a non-uniform mass distribution of the drone body is carefully designed to spontaneously restore the drone to the upright position from disturbances. A mathematical model of the restoration mechanism is developed to predict the restoration behavior showing a good agreement with the experimental data. The present swimming microdrone potentially lends itself to a robust 3-D maneuverable microscale mobile cargo navigating in vitro and in vivo for biomedical applications.","Liu, Fang-Wei; Cho, Sung Kwon",Lab chip (Online),423,26

DESIGN: A telephone and video assessment of IPC measures in SNFs at high risk or experiencing COVID-19 activity. PARTICIPANTS: SNFs in 14 New York counties, including New York City. INTERVENTION: A 3-component remote IPC assessment: (1) screening tool; (2) telephone IPC checklist; and (3) COVID-19 video IPC assessment (ie, ""COVIDeo""). RESULTS: In total, 92 SNFs completed the IPC screening tool and checklist: 52 (57%) were conducted as part COVID-19 investigations, and 40 (43%) were proactive prevention-based assessments. Among the 40 proactive assessments, 14 (35%) identified suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases. COVIDeo was performed in 26 (28%) of 92 assessments and provided observations that other tools would have missed: personal protective equipment (PPE) that was not easily accessible, redundant, or improperly donned, doffed, or stored and specific challenges implementing IPC in specialty populations. The IPC assessments took â¼1 hour each and reached an estimated 4 times as many SNFs as on-site visits in a similar time frame. CONCLUSIONS: Remote IPC assessments by telephone and video were timely and feasible methods of assessing the extent to which IPC interventions had been implemented in a vulnerable setting and to disseminate real-time recommendations. Remote assessments are now being implemented across New York State and in various healthcare facility types.

There is complex underlying pathophysiology with further derailment likely caused by acute cardiovascular changes associated with surgery. The implications for post-operative recovery are unclear, particularly in frail and older patients. We retrospectively explored patient notes for evidence of post-operative orthostatic intolerance in relation to pre-operative orthostatic hypotension. METHODS: Supine and 1-minute and 3-minute standing blood pressure measures obtained from adult patients before mainly general, orthopedic or uro/gynecology surgery were compared to post-operative outcome, specifically, evidence in patient notes about falls, feeling dizzy/unsteady and/or fearful to stand. Orthostatic hypotension was defined as a 20 mmHg or more and/or 10 mmHg or more fall in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, within ~3 minutes of standing after lying supine for an electrocardiogram. RESULTS: Whilst all patients included had a 1-minute standing blood pressure assessment (N = 170), 3-minute assessment was performed less commonly (N = 113). Nevertheless, one-quarter (23.5%; N = 40) of 170 patients had pre-operative orthostatic hypotension. This was not clearly explained by cardiac or neurological disease or by common medications, but did occur more frequently in older patients and in those aged 65 years or more with higher clinical frailty scale scores. The COVID-19 pandemic reduced the number of patients progressing to surgery within the planned study timescale (N = 143/170; 84.1%). Nevertheless, patients with orthostatic hypotension stayed longer in hospital post-operatively and were more likely to have an episode of fall, unsteadiness and/or dizziness documented (un-prompted) in their notes. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide further impetus for research into modifiable perioperative risk factors associated with orthostatic hypotension. These risks are not confined to those with a pre-existing dysautonomia diagnosis.","Hogan, Alexandra M; Luck, Claire; Woods, Sarah; Ortu, Andrea; Petkov, Svet",,423,1

We evaluated a screening strategy combining chest computed tomography (CT) and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for patients treated with radiation therapy at our cancer center located in a COVID-19 French hotspot during the first wave of the pandemic. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Chest CT images were proposed during radiation therapy CT simulation. Images were reviewed by an expert radiologist according to the COVID-19 Reporting and Data System classification. Nasal swabs with RT-PCR assay were initially proposed in cases of suspicious imaging or clinical context and were eventually integrated into the systematic screening. A dedicated radiation therapy workflow was proposed for COVID-19 patients to limit the risk of contamination. RESULTS: From March 18, 2020 to May 1, 2020, 480 patients were screened by chest CT, and 313 patients had both chest CT and RT-PCR (65%). The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was 5.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.6-7.8; 26 of 480 patients). Diagnosis of COVID-19 was made before radiation therapy for 22 patients (84.6%) and during RT for 4 patients (15.3%). Chest CT directly aided the diagnosis of 7 cases in which the initial RT-PCR was negative or not feasible, out of a total of 480 patients (1.5%) and 517 chest CT acquisitions. Four patients with COVID-19 at the time of the chest CT screening had a false negative CT. Sensitivity and specificity of chest CT screening in patients with both RT-PCR and chest CT testing were estimated at 0.82 (95% CI, 0.60-0.95) and 0.98 (95% CI, 0.96-0.99), respectively. Adaptation of the radiation therapy treatment was made for all patients, with 7 postponed treatments (median: 5 days; interquartile range, 1.5-14.8).

IBV is responsible for causing severe losses to the commercial poultry sector globally. The objectives of this study were to identify the viruses that were causing outbreaks of severe respiratory disease in chickens in Trinidad and Tobago (T&T) and to characterize the strains. Swab samples were collected from birds showing severe respiratory signs in five farms on the island of Trinidad. Samples were tested for the presence of IBV, as well as avian influenza virus (AIV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and avian metapneumovirus (aMPV) by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). All samples from the five farms tested negative for AIV, NDV and aMPV; however, samples from clinically affected birds in all five of the farms tested positive for IBV. Genetic data revealed the presence of TCoV in chickens on two of the farms. Interestingly, these two farms had never reared turkeys. Phylogenetic analysis showed that IBV S1 sequences formed two distinct clusters. Two sequences grouped with vaccine strains within the GI-1 lineage, whereas three sequences grouped together, but separately from other defined lineages, forming a likely new lineage of IBV. Pairwise comparison revealed that the three unique variant strains within the distinct lineage of IBV were significantly different in their S1 nucleotide coding regions from viruses in the closest lineage (16% difference) and locally used vaccine strains (>20% difference). Results also suggested that one of the samples was a recombinant virus, generated from a recombination event between a Trinidad virus of the GI-1 lineage and a Trinidad virus of the newly defined lineage. Many amino acid differences were also observed between the S1 coding regions of the circulating field and vaccine strains, indicating that the IBV vaccines may not be protective. Vaccine-challenge studies are however needed to prove this.","Brown Jordan, Arianne; Fusaro, Alice; Blake, Lemar; Milani, Adelaide; Zamperin, Gianpiero; Brown, Gabriel; Carrington, Christine V F; Monne, Isabella; Oura, Christopher A L",,423,24

We then systematically graded clinical, behavioral, laboratory and field environmental health research activities in four countries for both adult and child subjects using this framework. National and local government recommendations provided the minimum safety guidelines for our work. RESULTS: Our framework assesses risk based on staff proximity to the participant, exposure time between staff and participants, and potential viral aerosolization while performing the activity. For each activity, one of four risk levels, from minimal to unacceptable, is assigned and guidance on protective measures is provided. Those activities that can potentially aerosolize the virus are deemed the highest risk. CONCLUSIONS: By applying a systematic, procedure-specific approach to risk assessment for each trial activity, we were able to protect our participants and research team and to uphold our ability to deliver on the research commitments we have made to our staff, participants, local communities, and funders. This framework can be tailored to other research studies conducted in similar settings during the current pandemic, as well as potential future outbreaks with similar transmission dynamics.

One such neglected health determinant is the sex of the patient. This is an essential clinical characteristic, as it can factor into a patient’s clinical management and preventative measures. Some clinical studies have shown disparities in the proportion between males and females that have more severe clinical outcomes or, subsequently, die from this disease. However, this association has not been unequivocally established. Thus, the purpose of this investigation was to examine the association between male sex and COVID-19 severity. We systematically reviewed the literature, identified studies that matched predetermined selection criteria, and performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the proportion of males among four disease severity categories. Appropriate assessment strategies were implemented to assess and minimize potential biases. The results of this meta-analysis indicated that males constituted a significantly higher proportion of those who had adverse clinical outcomes and died from COVID-19. As the coronavirus spread from the East to the West, male sex remained a consistent risk factor. Our results support the establishment of the male sex as an important risk factor for this disease. Early identification and appropriate medical care for males with lab-confirmed COVID-19 may substantially change the course of clinical prognosis, resulting in greater numbers of lives saved.","Galbadage, Thushara; Peterson, Brent M.; Awada, Joseph; Buck, Alison S.; Ramirez, Danny A.; Wilson, Jason; Gunasekera, Richard S.",Front.

Thalidomide, a drug with known anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects has been indicated to be effective in treating a SARS-coV-2 pneumonia patient. Here, we study the possible mechanisms through which thalidomide might affect coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). METHODS: The present study explores the possibility of repurposing thalidomide for the treatment of SARS-coV-2 pneumonia by reanalysing transcriptomes of SARS-coV-2 infected tissues with thalidomide and lenalidomide induced transcriptomic changes in transformed lung and haematopoietic models as procured from databases, and further comparing them with the transcriptome of primary endothelial cells. RESULTS: Thalidomide and lenalidomide exhibited pleiotropic effects affecting a range of biological processes including inflammation, immune response, angiogenesis, MAPK signalling, NOD-like receptor signalling, Toll-like receptor signalling, leucocyte differentiation and innate immunity, the processes that are aberrantly regulated in severe COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: The present study indicates thalidomide analogues as a better fit for treating severe cases of novel viral infections, healing the damaged network by compensating the impairment caused by the COVID-19.","Sundaresan, Lakshmikirupa; Giri, Suvendu; Singh, Himanshi; Chatterjee, Suvro",,423,11

Cancer-related pain (CRP) is one of the most common symptoms may seek CAM. This study was conducted to identify the quantity and assess the quality of CAM recommendations across clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for the treatment and/or management of CRP, as this has not been explored in the literature. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted to identify cancer pain CPGs. MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL were searched from 2009 to 2020. The Guideline International Network and the National Centre for Complementary and Integrative Health websites were also searched. Eligible CPGs on CRP in adults were assessed using the Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II) instrument. RESULTS: Of 771 unique search results, 13 mentioned CAM and 11 made CAM recommendations. Eligible CPGs were published in 2009 or later and focused on the treatment/management of CRP. Scaled domain percentages from highest to lowest ranged from (overall, CAM): scope and purpose (88.1%, 88.1%) to applicability (21.0%, 8.5%). Quality varied within and across CPGs. One CPG was recommended by both appraisers; 6 were recommended as Yes or Yes with modifications. CONCLUSIONS: The present study has identified and summarized a number of CPGs which clinicians may consult to understand what CAMs are recommended in the context of the treatment and/or management of CRP.","Ng, Jeremy Y; Sharma, Alisha E",,423,24

I also address whether and when to give patients and their loved ones warning that access to treatment could be limited, using illness caused by COVID-19 as an example of how careproviders may better anticipate patients' needs at all times. Finally, I discuss careproviders' needs. I suggest that medical professionals' culture should make it as easy as possible for them to acknowledge their feelings of vulnerability, so that they may better determine, in times of disaster, whether they should treat or triage patients.

The questions dealt with the sanitary measures adopted; access to medical services; and mental suffering during the pandemic. The survey was answered by 1,466 participants (<18 yo = 53.3%) representing 192 rare diseases. Regarding physical distancing, 1,372 (93.6%) participants did not leave their residence, or did so only when essential; 1,321 (90.1%) always wore masks when leaving home. 1,042 (71.1%) and 995 (67.9%) participants, respectively, referred medical genetics appointments and rehabilitation therapies were postponed/canceled.

Nowadays, these dairy products are also important for people with an allergy to cow milk, and these products are an essential part of the local daily diet in regions of the world that are not suitable for cows and goats. Consumption of raw milk and raw milk products has a zoonotic risk, and with regard to sheep, the main pathogens associated with such dairy products are: Brucella melitensis, Campylobacter spp., Listeria spp., Salmonella spp., Shiga-toxin producing Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, tick borne encephalitis virus, and Toxoplasma gondii. Especially, young children, elderly people, pregnant women and immunocompromised (YOPI) persons, and those suffering from disease should be aware of the risk of consuming raw milk and raw milk products. This latter risk can be reduced by proper flock health management, prevention of contamination during milking, adequate milk processing, transport, and refrigerated storage. Only processes equaling pasteurization sufficiently reduce zoonotic risks from milk and milk products, but proper cooling is essential and recontamination must be prevented. Therefore, strict hygiene practices throughout the production process and supply chain especially for raw milk and raw dairy products, should be applied. Small scale production systems pose a greater risk compared to industrialized production systems because of a less protocolized and controlled production process. This manuscript describes zoonotic risks of pathogens from sheep and their milk borne transmission. Additionally, routes of contamination, possibilities for multiplication, and prevention measures thereof are described. We summarize some major human outbreaks caused by consumption of sheep milk and products made thereof, and finally discuss their implications.","van den Brom, René; de Jong, Aarieke; van Engelen, Erik; Heuvelink, Annet; Vellema, Piet",Small Rumin Res,423,16

Pregnant women are more susceptible to severe coronavirus disease 2019 and are at higher risk of preterm birth than uninfected pregnant women. Despite this evidence, the immunologic effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection during pregnancy remain understudied. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection during pregnancy on inflammatory and humoral responses in maternal and fetal samples and compare antibody responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 among pregnant and nonpregnant women. STUDY DESIGN: Immune responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 were analyzed using samples from pregnant (n=33) and nonpregnant (n=17) women who tested either positive (pregnant, 22; nonpregnant, 17) or negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (pregnant, 11) at Johns Hopkins Hospital. We measured proinflammatory and placental cytokine messenger RNAs, neonatal Fc receptor expression, and tetanus antibody transfer in maternal and cord blood samples. In addition, we evaluated antispike immunoglobulin G, antispike receptor-binding domain immunoglobulin G, and neutralizing antibody responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in serum or plasma collected from nonpregnant women, pregnant women, and cord blood. RESULTS: Pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection expressed more interleukin-1 beta, but not interleukin 6, in blood samples collected within 14 days vs >14 days after performing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 test. Pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection also had reduced antispike receptor-binding domain immunoglobulin G titers and were less likely to have detectable neutralizing antibody than nonpregnant women. Although severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection did not disrupt neonatal Fc receptor expression in the placenta, maternal transfer of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 neutralizing antibody was inhibited by infection during pregnancy. CONCLUSION: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection during pregnancy was characterized by placental inflammation and reduced antiviral antibody responses, which may impact the efficacy of coronavirus disease 2019 treatment in pregnancy. In addition, the long-term implications of placental inflammation for neonatal health require greater consideration.","Sherer, Morgan L; Lei, Jun; Creisher, Patrick S; Jang, Minyoung; Reddy, Ramya; Voegtline, Kristin; Olson, Sarah; Littlefield, Kirsten; Park, Han-Sol; Ursin, Rebecca L; Ganesan, Abhinaya; Boyer, Theresa; Elsayed, Nada; Brown, Diane M; Walch, Samantha N; Antar, Annukka A R; Manabe, Yukari C; Jones-Beatty, Kimberly; Golden, William Christopher; Satin, Andrew J; Sheffield, Jeanne S; Pekosz, Andrew; Klein, Sabra L; Burd, Irina",Am. j. obstet. gynecol,423,16

The class time is used in rehearsing and applying the knowledge using active learning approaches. The COVID-19 pandemic caused an unexpected shift from face-to-face to remote learning during the middle of the spring 2020 semester challenging both students and faculty. This study examined the transition of students from the flipped classroom method to rapid online learning and whether the transition was dependent on the faculty experience with FT. The perception of the transition of students in the classrooms of faculty (n=12) with extensive experience in FT (cohort 1) was compared with that of a second cohort (n=11) who were in their first semester of FT implementation. Both qualitative and quantitative survey data were collected from 23 classrooms (n=256 students). It was found that the students in the courses taught by cohort 1 who had received intensive FT training and implemented FT in semesters prior to the COVID-19 pandemic were able to facilitate a smoother transition and adjustment to fully online learning for their students compared to the students in the courses taught by cohort 2 (p&lt; 0.01). The qualitative data analysis suggested that the students participating in the FT courses in the first half of the semester, before the pandemic, had an easier transition to fully online learning. Students also expressed concerns that online learning was affected by the lack of interaction with faculty and peers, lack of motivation, issues with time management, and personal and technological demands. In conclusion, this study found that faculty experience with FT helped ease the transition of students from the face-to-face FT to the online format during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Gopalan, Chaya Onal Sinan Butts-Wilmsmeyer Carolyn Dickey Paige Serrano Charles Bracey Georgia Bartels Lynn Locke Sharon Fickas Julie",The FASEB Journal,423,20

Stress granules (SGs), which are assembled during viral infection and function to sequester host and viral mRNAs and proteins, are part of the antiviral responses. Here, we show that the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein, an RNA binding protein essential for viral production, interacted with Ras-GTPase-Activating protein SH3-domain-binding protein (G3BP) and disrupted SG assembly, both of which require intrinsically disordered region1 (IDR1) in N protein. The N protein partitioned into SGs through liquid-liquid phase separation with G3BP, and blocked the interaction of G3BP1 with other SG-related proteins. Moreover, the N protein domains important for phase separation with G3BP and SG disassembly were required for SARS-CoV-2 viral production. We propose that N protein-mediated SG disassembly is crucial for SARS-CoV-2 production.","Luo, Lingling; Li, Zhean; Zhao, Tiejun; Ju, Xiaohui; Ma, Peixiang; Jin, Boxing; Zhou, Yulin; He, Su; Huang, Jinhua; Xu, Xun; Zou, Yan; Li, Ping; Liang, Aibin; Liu, Jia; Chi, Tian; Huang, Xingxu; Ding, Qiang; Jin, Zhigang; Huang, Cheng; Zhang, Yu",,423,26

Epidemics are not solely a function of pathogens; they are also a function of how society is structured, how political power is wielded in the name of public health, how quantitative data is collected, how diseases are categorised and modelled, and how histories of disease are narrated. Each of these activities has its own history. As historians of science and medicine have long pointed out, even the most basic methodologies that underpin scientific research—observation, trust in numbers, the use of models, even the experimental method itself—have a history. They should not be taken as a given, but understood as processes, or even strategies, that were negotiated, argued for and against, and developed within particular historical contexts and explanatory schemes. Knowing the history of something—whether of numbers, narratives, or disease—enables us to see a broader range of trajectories available to us. These varied histories also remind us that we are currently in the midst of a chaotic drama of uncertainty, within our own unstable and unfolding narrative.","Charters, Erica; McKay, Richard A.",Centaurus,423,7

AIMS: This study aims to assess and compare referral patterns during COVID-19 to corresponding dates for the preceding 3 years (2017-2019), in order to preemptively coordinate the logistics of the surgical unit for similar future experiences. METHODS: Retrospective review for our institution, a national tertiary referral centre for spine pathology. Two distinct time-points were chosen to represent the varied levels of social restriction during the current pandemic: (i) study period 1 (SP1) from 11 November 2020 to 08 June 2020 represents a national lockdown, and (ii) study period 2 (SP2) from 09 June 2020 to 09 September 2020 indicates an easing of restrictions. Both periods were compared to corresponding dates (CP1: 11 March-08 June and CP2 09 June-09 September) for the preceding 3 years (2017-2019). Data collected included age, gender, and mechanism of injury (MOI) for descriptive analyses. MOIs were categorised into disc disease, cyclist, road-traffic-accident (RTA), falls < 2 m, falls > 2 m, malignancy, sporting injuries, and miscellaneous. RESULTS: All MOI categories witnessed a reduction in referral numbers during SP1: disc disease (-29%), cyclist (-5%), RTAs (-66%), falls < 2 m (-39%), falls > 2 m (-17%), malignancy (-33%), sporting injuries (-100%), and miscellaneous (-58%). Four of 8 categories (RTAs, falls < 2 m, malignancy, miscellaneous) showed a trend towards return of pre-lockdown values during SP2. Two categories (disc disease, falls > 2 m) showed a further reduction (-34%, -27%) during SP2. One category (sporting injuries) portrayed a complete return to normal values during SP2 while a notable increase in cyclist-related referrals was witnessed (+ 63%) when compared with corresponding dates of previous years. CONCLUSION: Spinal injury continues to occur across almost all categories, albeit at considerably reduced numbers. RTAs and falls remained the most common MOI. Awareness needs to be drawn to the reduction of malignancy-related referrals to dissuade people with such symptoms from avoiding presentation to hospital over periods of social restrictions.","O039,; Halloran, Louis; Ahern, Daniel P; McDonnell, Jake M; Cunniffe, Gráinne M; Dodds, Michael K; Lyons, Frank; Cassidy, Noelle; Timlin, Marcus; Morris, Seamus; Synnott, Keith; Butler, Joseph S",Ir. j. med. sci,423,33

These numbers are significantly lower than reported prepandemic in-hospital cardiac arrest survival rates of approximately 20-25% in the United States for non-coronavirus disease 2019 patients. OBJECTIVE: To assess the incidence of in-hospital cardiac arrest survival of coronavirus disease 2019 patients. DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study of adult patients with coronavirus disease 2019 subsequently found to have in-hospital cardiac arrest and underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (cardiopulmonary resuscitation). SETTING: Multiple hospitals of the Cleveland Clinic Health System. PATIENTS: All adult patients (age &gt;= 18 yr) admitted to Cleveland Clinic Health System with a diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 who experienced in-hospital cardiac arrest requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: From March 01, 2020 to October 15, 2020, 3,555 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 were hospitalized;1,372 were admitted to the ICU;58 patients had in-hospital cardiac arrest. Median age of this cohort was 66.5 years (interquartile range, 55.0-76.0 yr). Patients were predominantly male (62.5%), White (53.4%), with a median body mass index of 29.7 (interquartile range, 25.8-34.6).

Case examples show that markets were adversely affected in ways that caused avoidable shortages of critical goods and supplies. Moreover, public procurement effectiveness was likely reduced by short-run efforts to obtain political advantage. The article begins with a brief review of disaster procurement, highlighting how public procurement professionals tried to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. The next section delineates three politically led phenomena that adversely impacted procurement’s ability to acquire the needed goods and services, including a lack of cohesive strategy in acquiring essential personal protective equipment; preference for unproven drugs and magical thinking; and cozy relationships between the public and private sectors.

The radius of the steepest slope in the dark matter, otherwise known as the splashback radius, is located at ~r_200m; the strength and location of this feature depends on the recent mass accretion rate, in good agreement with previous work. Interestingly, the stellar distribution (or intracluster light, ICL) also has a well-defined edge, which is directly related to the splashback radius of the halo. Thus, detecting the edge of the ICL can provide an independent measure of the physical boundary of the halo, and the recent mass accretion rate. We show that these caustics can also be seen in the projected density profiles, but care must be taken to account for the influence of substructures and other non-diffuse material, which can bias and/or weaken the signal of the steepest slope.

The intervention of a president and his/her ministries with their political and economic interests is particularly problematic when they employ a tactical approach rather than provide accurate and effective disaster information. This paper utilizes a political-economy approach to analyze the link between COVID-19 communication policies and practices with the interests of politics and market stability in Indonesia. In this paper, the author drills into the extent to which the country's president and ministries manage their political interests in times of global pandemic. The ways they interact with the public during various stages of disaster are crucial because society is severely disrupted, with the government serving as the sole actor. This study uses qualitative methods and all materials are managed from an extensive review of current literature, policy analysis, and field observation. This paper finds that Indonesian government communication during the COVID-19 pandemic period (February- June 2020) has been dominated by a desire to maintain a strong power of the ruling authority and to secure market stability. Two factors-pro-market communication policies and manufacturedpoliticized COVID-19 data-have occurred. This paper contributes to the literature by focusing on the political and economic approach over the mediated discourses surrounding the pandemic. © 2021 Jurnal Ilmu Sosial dan Ilmu Politik.

Medical staffs carrying out the task of collecting NP specimens are in close contact with the suspected patient, thereby posing a high risk of cross-infection. We propose a low-cost miniature robot that can be easily assembled and remotely controlled. The system includes an active end-effector, a passive positioning arm, and a detachable swab gripper with integrated force sensing capability. The cost of the materials for building this robot is 55 USD and the total weight of the functional part is 0.23kg. The design of the force sensing swab gripper was justified using Finite Element (FE) modeling and the performances of the robot were validated with a simulation phantom and three pig noses. FE analysis indicated a 0.5mm magnitude displacement of the gripper's sensing beam, which meets the ideal detecting range of the optoelectronic sensor. Studies on both the phantom and the pig nose demonstrated the successful operation of the robot during the collection task. The average forces were found to be 0.35N and 0.85N, respectively. It is concluded that the proposed robot is promising and could be further developed to be used in vivo.","Wang, Shuangyi; Wang, Kehao; Liu, Hongbin; Hou, Zengguang",,423,1

To date, there are several agents under active investigation as potential treatments, among them is the interleukin-6 receptor blocker tocilizumab. Early observational studies have identified an association between the use of tocilizumab and a decreased risk of intubation and/or death, however randomized clinical trials have not found a significant benefit yet. The aim of our study was to assess whether the timing of tocilizumab influenced the outcome of patients with severe COVID-19. Methods: This is a retrospective observational study involving 56 Ecuadorian patients treated with corticosteroids plus tocilizumab after a confirmed diagnosis of severe COVID-19 respiratory disease in the context of a hyperinflammatory state. A hyperinflammatory state was defined by the SIRS criteria plus at least 1 of the following three: i.) CRP &gt;100 mg/L, ii.) serum ferritin &gt;900 μg/L on one occasion or a twofold increase of the level at admission within 48 hours;or iii.) D-dimer level &gt;1500 μg/L. Descriptive statistics were reported. A point-biserial correlation was conducted to assess the relationship between symptomatic days prior treatment with survival status. Furthermore, a chi-square test for association was performed between corticosteroids/tocilizumab dosage and survival status. All the data was analyzed using SPSS, version 24.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). For all test a p-value of less than 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. Results: The sample mean age was 61.7 (SD 10.9) years with a 7:3 male/female ratio. 76.8% (n=43) patients survived with a mean time to hospital discharge of 11.5 days (SD 12.0). Regarding treatment, average days prior to corticosteroids administration was 2.6 (SD 2.5), while 11.1 (SD 9.0) was for tocilizumab. A statistically significant negative correlation between days prior tocilizumab administration and survival status was reported (rpb =-.290, n = 56, p = .030) (Figure 1). On the other hand, no significant association between tocilizumab dosage and survival status was determined (χ2 (5) = 3.566, p = .600). Same analyses with corticosteroids yielded non-significant results. Conclusion: Early administration of tocilizumab was associated with a greater likelihood of surviving, an observation that could not be reproduced with corticosteroids. The association between tocilizumab dosage and survival status, however, was not statistically significant. Further large-scale studies are needed to confirm the exact role of the timing of tocilizumab in patients with severe COVID-19.

High level of mental workload increased their risks of insomnia, anxiety, and depression. This study committed to investigate frontline HCWs' mental workload and analyze its influencing factors during the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. A total of 802 frontline HCWs completed the online questionnaires. Their total mental workload score was 69.7 ± 16.4. Frontline HCWs were satisfied with their performance (4.0 ± 3.3) and showed a low level of frustration (8.3 ± 5.7). The most important dimensions of mental workload were ""effort"" (16.4 ± 13.7), ""physical demand"" (15.7 ± 4.7), and ""mental demand"" (12.9 ± 5.2). Frontline nurses and HCWs who have higher education level, longer working years, and higher professional title perceived higher mental workload scores (P < .05). In conclusion, frontline HCWs' mental workload was not high as seen during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. They have made tremendous efforts and dedication to caring for COVID-19 patients. Job-related factors, some of which can be eliminated by proper management skills, increased frontline HCWs mental workload.","Du, Meichen; Hu, Kaili",Asia Pac J Public Health,423,28

In the earliest phases of the collapse of a protostar a disc forms around the young star and such discs are observed for the first several million years of a star's life. It is within these circumstellar, or protoplanetary, discs that the first stages of planet formation occur. Recent observations from ALMA suggest that planet formation may already be well under way after only 1 Myr of a star's life. However, stars do not form in isolation; they form from the collapse and fragmentation of giant molecular clouds several parsecs in size. This results in young stars forming in groups - often referred to as 'clusters'. In these star-forming regions the stellar density is much higher than the location of the Sun, and other stars in the Galactic disc that host exoplanets. As such, the environment where stars form has the potential to influence the planet formation process. In star-forming regions, protoplanetary discs can be truncated or destroyed by interactions with passing stars, as well as photoevaporation from the radiation fields of very massive stars. Once formed, the planets themselves can have their orbits altered by dynamical encounters - either directly from passing stars or through secondary effects such as the Kozai-Lidov mechanism. In this contribution, I review the different processes that can affect planet formation and stability in star-forming regions. I discuss each process in light of the typical range of stellar densities observed for star-forming regions. I finish by discussing these effects in the context of theories for the birth environment of the Solar System.","Parker, Richard J.",,423,1

For disease surveillance in the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) combine more than 65 individual forecasts of these numbers in an ensemble forecast at national and state levels. We collected data on CDC ensemble forecasts of COVID-19 fatalities in the United States, and compare them with easily interpretable ``Euler'' forecasts serving as a model-free benchmark that is only based on the local rate of change of the incidence curve. The term ``Euler method'' is motivated by the eponymous numerical integration scheme that calculates the value of a function at a future time step based on the current rate of change. Our results show that CDC ensemble forecasts are not more accurate than ``Euler'' forecasts on short-term forecasting horizons of one week. However, CDC ensemble forecasts show a better performance on longer forecasting horizons. Using the current rate of change in incidences as estimates of future incidence changes is useful for epidemic forecasting on short time horizons. An advantage of the proposed method over other forecasting approaches is that it can be implemented with a very limited amount of work and without relying on additional data (e.g., human mobility and contact patterns) and high-performance computing systems.","Antulov-Fantulin, Nino; Bottcher, Lucas",,423,16

To reduce disease transmission, national regulatory agencies temporarily recommended curtailment of all nonurgent office visits and elective surgeries in March 2020, including vitreoretinal outpatient care in the USA. The effect of these guidelines on utilization of vitreoretinal care has not been explored to date. RECENT FINDINGS: Retinal outpatient visits, new patient visits, intravitreal antivascular endothelial growth factor injections and in-office multimodal retinal imaging has seen a significant decline in utilization in the early phase of the pandemic. Intravitreal injections were performed at a comparatively higher rate than office visits. Utilization appeared to steadily increase in April 2020. Telemedicine visits, enabled by new national legislation for all areas of medicine, have been adopted to a modest degree by the retina community. SUMMARY: In-office retinal care declined in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and national regulatory guidelines limiting nonurgent care. These trends in practice patterns and care utilization may be of interest to vitreoretinal providers and all ophthalmologists at large.","Xu, David; Starr, Matthew R; Boucher, Nicholas; Chiang, Allen; Yonekawa, Yoshihiro; Klufas, Michael A; Khan, M Ali; Cohen, Michael N; Mehta, Sonia; Kuriyan, Ajay E",Curr Opin Ophthalmol,423,1

OBJECTIVE: To describe trends in composition of uroliths in cats and evaluate risk factors related to age, breed, sex, urolith location, and bacterial urolith cultures. SAMPLE POPULATION: A total of 3940 uroliths and the cats from which they were obtained. METHODS: The database of the UC Davis Gerald V. Ling Urinary Stone Analysis Laboratory was searched for all urolith submissions from cats between January 2005 and December 2018. Mineral type, age, breed, sex, and urolith location and culture results were recorded. Trends were evaluated and variables compared to evaluate risk factors. RESULTS: A significant decrease in the proportion of calcium oxalate (CaOx)-containing uroliths occurred over time (P = .02), from 50.1% (204/407) of all submissions in 2005 to 37.7% (58/154) in 2018. In contrast, the proportion of struvite-containing uroliths increased significantly (P = .002), from 41.8% (170/407) in 2005 to 54.5% (84/154) in 2018. The proportion of CaOx-containing uroliths in the upper urinary tract was significantly higher compared to the proportion of other urolith types in the upper urinary tract. Urate-containing uroliths were the third most common type (361/3940, 9.2%). Overall, sex and age predispositions were similar to those reported previously. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The decrease in the proportion of CaOx-containing uroliths and increase in the proportion of struvite-containing uroliths warrants investigation. Further education regarding the efficacy of medical dissolution of struvite-containing uroliths is recommended.","Kopecny, Lucy; Palm, Carrie A; Segev, Gilad; Larsen, Jennifer A; Westropp, Jodi L",J. vet. intern. med,423,24

To avoid the risk of fecal-oral transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) during the procedure, the patient's lower body was covered with a 2 m2 vinyl sheet with an aperture (diameter, approximately 2 cm). None of the medical staff involved exhibited any signs of SARS-CoV-2 infection after the procedure.

We developed a support network to urgently deal with patients with intractable neurological disease at the time of disaster and strengthen disaster measures, including effective disaster countermeasure training. During the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake, we realized the need to prepare for natural disasters, leading to a state of emergency, at normal times. A list of vulnerable people should be prepared and the individual support plan for disaster should be confirmed during normal times. Furthermore, during disaster, livelihood support is required for patients with intractable neurological disease living in evacuation centers in affected areas. Therefore, we compiled and published the book, titled ""The manual of disaster countermeasures,"" in 2017. The Committee for Measures Against Disaster in the Japanese Society of Neurology has appointed a liaison officer for patients with intractable neurological disease in each prefecture.

By LCA posterior probabilities we identified three classes: (1) minimal impact of COVID-19 (54.1%), (2) objective risk for COVID-19 (41.5%), and (3) anxiety and economic stress caused by COVID-19 (4.4%). Multivariate logistic regression showed that compared with those in class one, the odds to have significant DS were almost five times higher for those in class three.

MethodsWe did a double-blind, randomised, multicentre, phase 3 clinical trial in 25 Indian hospitals to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and immunological lot consistency of BBV152. Healthy adults (age 18-98 years) randomised 1:1 using a computer-generated randomisation scheme received two intramuscular doses of vaccine or placebo administered four weeks apart. The primary outcome was laboratory-confirmed symptomatic COVID-19, occurring at least 14 days after the second dose. Secondary outcomes were efficacy in sub-groups for age (18-< 60 years and [≥] 60 years) and in participants with pre-existing stable medical conditions. We also evaluated safety, reactogenicity, and consistency of immune responses for three consecutive manufacturing lots. FindingsBetween November 16, 2020 and January 7, 2021 we recruited 25,798 participants who were randomised to BBV152 or placebo groups; 24,419 received two doses of BBV152 (n = 12,221) or placebo (n = 12,198).

Efficacy against asymptomatic COVID-19 was 63{middle dot}6% (29{middle dot}0-82{middle dot}4). BBV152 conferred 65{middle dot}2% (95% CI: 33{middle dot}1-83{middle dot}0) protection against the SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern, B.1.617.2 (Delta). BBV152 was well tolerated with no clinically or statistically significant differences in the distributions of solicited, unsolicited, or serious adverse events between vaccine and placebo groups. No cases of anaphylaxis or vaccine-related deaths were reported. InterpretationBBV152 was immunogenic and highly efficacious against symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 variant associated disease, particularly against severe disease in adults.

We monitored SARS-CoV-2 infection rates in school-aged children and compared them with adult infection rates before and after schools reopened in England. METHODS: Public Health England receives daily electronic reports of all SARS-CoV-2 tests nationally. SARS-CoV-2 infection rates by school year from July to December 2020 were analysed, including the effect of a national month-long lockdown whilst keeping schools open in November 2020 RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 infections rates were low during early summer but started increasing in mid-August, initially in young adults followed by secondary and then primary school-aged children prior to schools reopening in September 2020. Cases in school-aged children lagged behind and followed adult trends after schools reopened, with a strong age gradient in weekly infection rates. There was a strong (P<0.001) correlation in regional infection rates between adults and secondary (R2=0.96-0.98), primary (R2=0.93-0.94) and preschool-aged (R2=0.62-0.85) children. The November lockdown was associated with declines in adult infection rates, followed a week later, by declines in student cases. From 23 November 2020, cases in adults and children increased rapidly following the emergence of a more transmissible novel variant of concern (VOC-202,012/01; B.1.1.7). CONCLUSIONS: In school-aged children, SARS-CoV-2 infections followed the same trajectory as adult cases and only declined after national lockdown was implemented whilst keeping schools open. Maintaining low community infection rates is critical for keeping schools open during the pandemic.","Mensah, Anna A; Sinnathamby, Mary; Zaidi, Asad; Coughlan, Laura; Simmons, Ruth; Ismail, Sharif A; Ramsay, Mary E; Saliba, Vanessa; Ladhani, Shamez N",J Infect,423,1

Given the extent of the current pandemic (people in over one hundred countries infected) and its disastrous effect on world economy (associated with limitations of human rights), speedy drug discovery is critical. In this situation, past investments into the development of new (animal-free) approach methods (NAM) for drug safety, efficacy, and quality evaluation can be leveraged. For this, we provide an overview of repurposing ideas to shortcut drug development times. Animal-based testing would be too lengthy, and it largely fails, when a pathogen is species-specific or if the desired drug is based on specific features of human biology. Fortunately, industry has already largely shifted to NAM, and some public funding programs have advanced the development of animal-free technologies. For instance, NAM can predict genotoxicity (a major aspect of carcinogenicity) within days, human antibodies targeting virus epitopes can be generated in molecular biology laboratories within weeks, and various human cell-based organoids are available to test virus infectivity and the biological processes controlling them. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has formed an expert group to pave the way for the use of such approaches for accelerated drug development. This situation illustrates the importance of diversification in drug discovery strategies and clearly shows the shortcomings of an approach that invests 95% of resources into a single technology (animal experimentation) in the face of challenges that require alternative approaches.","Busquet, Francois; Hartung, Thomas; Pallocca, Giorgia; Rovida, Costanza; Leist, Marcel",Arch Toxicol,423,0

Most existing metrics, which were tailored solely to the image synthesis setup, exhibit a limited capacity for diagnosing the different modes of failure of generative models across broader application domains. In this paper, we introduce a 3-dimensional evaluation metric, ($\alpha$-Precision, $\beta$-Recall, Authenticity), that characterizes the fidelity, diversity and generalization performance of any generative model in a domain-agnostic fashion. Our metric unifies statistical divergence measures with precision-recall analysis, enabling sample- and distribution-level diagnoses of model fidelity and diversity. We introduce generalization as an additional, independent dimension (to the fidelity-diversity trade-off) that quantifies the extent to which a model copies training data -- a crucial performance indicator when modeling sensitive data with requirements on privacy. The three metric components correspond to (interpretable) probabilistic quantities, and are estimated via sample-level binary classification. The sample-level nature of our metric inspires a novel use case which we call model auditing, wherein we judge the quality of individual samples generated by a (black-box) model, discarding low-quality samples and hence improving the overall model performance in a post-hoc manner.","Alaa, Ahmed M.; Breugel, Boris van; Saveliev, Evgeny; Schaar, Mihaela van der",,423,6

Methods Three cross-sectional national surveys with non-overlapping random samples of the population in England undertaken between late June and September 2020 (REACT-2 study). 365,104 adults completed questionnaires and self-administered lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) tests for IgG against SARS-CoV-2. Findings Overall, 17,576 people had detectable antibodies, a prevalence of 4.9% (95% confidence intervals 4.9, 5.0) when adjusted for test characteristics and weighted to the adult population of England. The prevalence declined from 6.0% (5.8, 6.1), to 4.8% (4.7, 5.0) and 4.4% (4.3, 4.5), over the three rounds of the study a difference of -26.5% (-29.0, -23.8). The highest prevalence and smallest overall decline in positivity was in the youngest age group (18-24 years) at -14.9% (-21.6, -8.1), and lowest prevalence and largest decline in the oldest group (&gt;74 years) at -39.0% (-50.8, -27.2). The decline from June to September 2020 was largest in those who did not report a history of COVID-19 at -64.0% (-75.6, -52.3), compared to -22.3% (-27.0, -17.7) in those with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed on PCR. Interpretation A large proportion of the population remained susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection in England based on naturally acquired immunity from the first wave. Widespread vaccination is needed to confer immunity and control the epidemic at population level.

DESIGN: Confidential, self-administered questionnaire. SETTING: One hundred twenty-seven U.S. pediatric extracorporeal membrane oxygenation centers. SUBJECTS: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation center program directors and coordinators. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In March 2020, a survey was sent to 127 pediatric extracorporeal membrane oxygenation centers asking them to report their current hospital extracorporeal membrane oxygenation guidelines for coronavirus disease 2019-positive patients. Respondents were also asked their opinion on three ethical dilemmas including: prioritization of children over adults for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation use, institution of do-not-resuscitate orders, and the use of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation for coronavirus disease 2019-positive patients. Forty-seven extracorporeal membrane oxygenation centers had enacted guidelines including 46 (100%) that offer venovenous-extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and 42 (89%) that offer venoarterial-extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for coronavirus disease 2019-positive pediatric patients. Forty-four centers (94%) stated that the indications for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation candidacy in coronavirus disease 2019 disease were similar to those used in other viral illnesses, such as respiratory syncytial virus or influenza. Most program directors (98%) did not endorse that children hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 should be made do-not-resuscitate and had variable opinions on whether children should be given higher priority over adults when rationing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Over half of program directors (60%) did not support the use of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation for coronavirus disease 2019. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of pediatric extracorporeal membrane oxygenation centers have proactively established guidelines for the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for coronavirus disease 2019-related illnesses. Further work is needed to help guide the fair allocation of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation resources and to determine the appropriateness of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation.","MacGregor, Robert M; Antiel, Ryan M; Najaf, Tasnim; Said, Ahmed S; Warner, Brad W; Raval, Mehul V; Shakhsheer, Baddr",Pediatr Crit Care Med,423,24

A growing body of literature raises the issue of Vitamin C and Vitamin D as a risk-assessment tool, and therapeutic option, in COVID-19. Objective: The objective of this pilot study was to measure serum Vitamin C and Vitamin D levels in a cohort of patients with critical COVID-19 illness in our community hospital ICU, correlate with other illness risk factors (age, BMI, HgbA1c, smoking status), generate hypotheses, and suggest further therapeutic intervention studies. Method: This pilot study included all 21 critically ill COVID-19 patients hospitalized in May 2020 in the ICU of North Suburban Medical Center, Thornton, Colorado, in whose care the principal investigator (C.A.) was involved. We measured patients' serum Vitamin C and Vitamin D levels, and standard risk factors like age, BMI, HbA1c, and smoking status. Variables in this study were gauged using descriptive statistics. Results: Of 21 critically ill COVID-19 patients (15 males and 6 females, 17 Hispanic and 4 Caucasian, of median age 61â¯years, range 20-94), there were 11 survivors.Serum levels of Vitamin C and Vitamin D were low in most of our critically ill COVID-19 ICU patients.Older age and low Vitamin C level appeared co-dependent risk factors for mortality from COVID-19 in our sample.Insulin resistance and obesity were prevalent in our small cohort, but smoking was not. Conclusion: Our pilot study found low serum levels of Vitamin C and Vitamin D in most of our critically ill COVID-19 ICU patients. Older age and low Vitamin C level appeared co-dependent risk factors for mortality. Many were also insulin-resistant or diabetic, overweight or obese, known as independent risk factors for low Vitamin C and Vitamin D levels, and for COVID-19.These findings suggest the need to further explore whether caring for COVID-19 patients ought to routinely include measuring and correcting serum Vitamin C and Vitamin D levels, and whether treating critically ill COVID-19 warrants acute parenteral Vitamin C and Vitamin D replacement.","Arvinte, Cristian; Singh, Maharaj; Marik, Paul E",Med Drug Discov,423,30

Because SARS CoV-2 virus is spread via respiratory droplets, bag-mask ventilation, intubation, and extubation may place health care workers (HCW) at risk. While existing recommendations address airway management in patients with COVID-19, no guidance exists specifically for difficult airway management. Some strategies normally recommended for difficult airway management may not be ideal in the setting of COVID-19 infection. To address this issue the Society for Airway Management (SAM) created a task force to review existing literature and current Practice Guidelines for management of the difficult airway by the American Society of Anesthesiologists Task Force on Management of the Difficult Airway. SAM task force created recommendations for management of known or suspected difficult airway in the setting of known or suspected COVID-19 infection. The goal of the task force was to optimize successful airway management while minimizing exposure risk. Each member conducted a literature review on specific clinical practice section utilizing standard search engines (PubMed, Ovid, Google Scholar). Existing recommendations and evidence for difficult airway management in COVID-19 context were developed. Each specific recommendation was discussed among task force members and modified until unanimously approved by all task force members. Elements of AGREE Reporting Checklist for dissemination of clinical practice guidelines were utilized to develop this statement. Airway management in the COVID-19 patient increases HCW exposure risk. and difficult airway management often takes longer, may involve multiple procedures with aerosolization potential, strict adherence to personal protective equipment (PPE) protocols is mandatory to reduce risk to providers. When patient's airway risk assessment suggests awake tracheal intubation is an appropriate choice of technique, procedures that may cause increased aerosolization of secretions should be avoided. Optimal preoxygenation before induction with tight seal facemask may be performed to reduce risk of hypoxemia. Unless the patient is experiencing oxygen desaturation, positive pressure bag-mask ventilation after induction may be avoided to reduce aerosolization. For optimal intubating conditions, patients should be anesthetized with full muscle relaxation. Videolaryngoscopy is recommended as first-line strategy for airway management. If emergent invasive airway access is indicated, we recommend a surgical technique such as scalpel-bougie-tube, rather than an aerosolizing generating procedure, such as transtracheal jet ventilation. This statement represents recommendations by SAM task force for the difficult airway management of adults with COVID-19 with the goal to optimize successful airway management while minimizing the risk of clinician exposure.","Foley, Lorraine J; Urdaneta, Felipe; Berkow, Lauren; Aziz, Michael F; Baker, Paul A; Jagannathan, Narasimhan; Rosenblatt, William; Straker, Tracey M; Wong, David T; Hagberg, Carin A",,423,16

Thus, PQ is frequently found in surface water systems and is potentially toxic to aquatic organisms, since it can cause mitochondrial dysfunction altering in the redox state of cells. This study aimed to investigate the chronic effects of PQ to Chironomus riparius and Girardia tigrina, and compare their physiological strategies to cope with environmental stress. The mean emergence time was the most sensitive endpoint for Chironomids, with the lowest observed effect concentrations (LOEC) being 0.02 for males and 0.1 mg PQ L-1 for females. Moreover, PQ reduced the body weight of male and female imagoes, with LOECs of 0.5 and 2.5 mg PQ L-1, respectively. Paraquat also decreased the respiration rate (LOEC = 2.5 mg PQ L-1) and total glutathione (tGSH) content (LOEC = 0.5 mg PQ L-1). Thus, the aerobic production of energy was not affected and allowed chironomids to cope with oxidative stress induced by PQ, but with consequent physiological costs in terms of development rates and weight of adults. In planarians, PQ decreased the locomotion and feeding activity, and delayed photoreceptor regeneration (LOECs = 2.5 mg PQ L-1 for all endpoints). Despite increased aerobic energy production (LOEC = 0.5 mg PQ L-1), planarians were not able to cope with oxidative stress induced by the highest PQ concentrations, since lipid peroxidation levels were significantly increased (LOEC = 2.5 mg PQ L-1) concomitantly with a significant decrease of tGSH (LOEC = 2.5 mg PQ L-1). These results showed that planarians were unable to cope with oxidative stress induced by PQ with consequent impairments of behavior and regeneration despite an increased aerobic energy production.","Saraiva, Althiéris S; Sarmento, Renato A; Gravato, Carlos; Rodrigues, Andreia C M; Campos, Diana; Simão, Fátima C P; Soares, Amadeu M V M",Sci Total Environ,423,22

We demonstrate this by using data covering top-20 worst-hit countries, distinctly in terms of reported cases and deaths. The results reveal that the model that incorporates health-news index outperforms the benchmark historical average model, indicating the significance of health news searches as a good predictor of stock returns since the emergence of the pandemic. We also find that accounting for “asymmetry” effect, adjusting for macroeconomic factors and incorporating financial news improve the forecast performance of the health news-based model. These results are consistently robust to data sample (both for the in-sample and out-of-sample forecast periods), outliers and heterogeneity.","Salisu, Afees A.; Vo, Xuan Vinh",Int. Rev. Financ.

METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a retrospective single-center study of consecutively admitted patients between March 1st and May 15th, 2020, with a definitive diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The primary end-point was to evaluate the association of lipid markers with 30-days all-cause mortality in COVID-19. A total of 654 patients were enrolled, with an estimated 30-day mortality of 22.8% (149 patients). Non-survivors had lower total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) levels during the entire course of the disease. Both showed a significant inverse correlation with inflammatory markers and a positive correlation with lymphocyte count. In a multivariate analysis, LDL-c &#8804; 69 mg/dl (hazard ratio [HR] 1.94; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14-3.31), C-reactive protein >88 mg/dl (HR 2.44; 95% CI, 1.41-4.23) and lymphopenia <1000 (HR 2.68; 95% CI, 1.91-3.78) at admission were independently associated with 30-day mortality. This association was maintained 7 days after admission. Survivors presented with complete normalization of their lipid profiles on short-term follow-up. CONCLUSION: Hypolipidemia in SARS-CoV-2 infection may be secondary to an immune-inflammatory response, with complete recovery in survivors. Low LDL-c serum levels are independently associated with higher 30-day mortality in COVID-19 patients.","Aparisi, Álvaro; Iglesias-Echeverría, Carolina; Ybarra-Falcón, Cristina; Cusácovich, Iván; Uribarri, Aitor; García-Gómez, Mario; Ladrón, Raquel; Fuertes, Raúl; Candela, Jordi; Tobar, Javier; Hinojosa, Williams; Dueñas, Carlos; González, Roberto; Nogales, Leonor; Calvo, Dolores; Carrasco-Moraleja, Manuel; San Román, J Alberto; Amat-Santos, Ignacio J; Andaluz-Ojeda, David",Nutr. metab. cardiovasc. dis,423,24

Hospitalizations for acute cardiovascular conditions have declined, raising concern that patients may be avoiding hospitals because of fear of contracting severe acute respiratory syndrome- coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Other factors, including strain on health care systems, may also have had an indirect toll. OBJECTIVES: This investigation aimed to evaluate whether population-level deaths due to cardiovascular causes increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The authors conducted an observational cohort study using data from the National Center for Health Statistics to evaluate the rate of deaths due to cardiovascular causes after the onset of the pandemic in the United States, from March 18, 2020, to June 2, 2020, relative to the period immediately preceding the pandemic (January 1, 2020 to March 17, 2020). Changes in deaths were compared with the same periods in the previous year. RESULTS: There were 397,042 cardiovascular deaths from January 1, 2020, to June 2, 2020. Deaths caused by ischemic heart disease increased nationally after the onset of the pandemic in 2020, compared with changes over the same period in 2019 (ratio of the relative change in deaths per 100,000 in 2020 vs. 2019: 1.11, 95% confidence interval: 1.04 to 1.18). An increase was also observed for deaths caused by hypertensive disease (1.17, 95% confidence interval: 1.09 to 1.26), but not for heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, or other diseases of the circulatory system. New York City experienced a large relative increase in deaths caused by ischemic heart disease (2.39, 95% confidence interval: 1.39 to 4.09) and hypertensive diseases (2.64, 95% confidence interval: 1.52 to 4.56) during the pandemic. More modest increases in deaths caused by these conditions occurred in the remainder of New York State, New Jersey, Michigan, and Illinois but not in Massachusetts or Louisiana. CONCLUSIONS: There was an increase in deaths caused by ischemic heart disease and hypertensive diseases in some regions of the United States during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings suggest that the pandemic may have had an indirect toll on patients with cardiovascular disease.","Wadhera, Rishi K; Shen, Changyu; Gondi, Suhas; Chen, Siyan; Kazi, Dhruv S; Yeh, Robert W",J Am Coll Cardiol,423,10

This study examined whether a commercial LAMP assay can reliably detect SARS-CoV-2 genomes directly in respiratory samples without having to extract nucleic acids (NA) beforehand. Nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS, n = 220) were tested by real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and with the LAMP assay. For RT-PCR, NA were investigated. For LAMP, NA from 26 NPS in viral transport medium (VTM) were tested. The other 194 NPS were analyzed directly without prior NA extraction (140 samples in VTM; 54 dry swab samples stirred in phosphate buffered saline). Ten NPS were tested directly by LAMP using a sous-vide cooking unit. The isothermal assay demonstrated excellent specificity (100%) but moderate sensitivity (68.8%), with a positive predictive value of 1 and a negative predictive value of 0.65 for direct testing of NPS in VTM. The use of dry swabs, even without NA extraction, improved the analytical sensitivity; up to 6% of samples showed signs of inhibition. LAMP could be performed successfully with a sous-vide cooking unit. This technique is very fast, requires little laboratory resources, and can replace rapid antigen tests or verify reactive rapid tests on-site.","Anastasiou, Olympia E; Holtkamp, Caroline; Schäfer, Miriam; Schön, Frieda; Eis-Hübinger, Anna Maria; Krumbholz, Andi",Viruses,423,16

Medical student assessment is an important aspect of adjusting curriculums in the era of increased virtual learning. METHODS: Students took our previously validated free response clinical skills exam (CSE) at the end of the scheduled clerkship as an open-book exam to eliminate any concern for breaches in the honor code and then grades were adjusted based on historic norms. The National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) shelf exam was taken with a virtual proctor. Students whose clerkship was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic were compared to the students from a similarly timed surgery block the previous 3 years. Primary outcomes included CSE and NBME exam scores. Secondary outcomes included clinical evaluations and the percentage of students who received grades of Honors, High Pass, and Pass. After the surgery clerkship was completed, we surveyed all students who participated in the surgery clerkship during the COVID-19 crisis. RESULTS: There were 19 students during the COVID-interrupted clerkship and 61 students in similarly timed clerkships between 2017 and 2019. Prior to adjustment and compared to historic scores, the COVID-interrupted clerkship group scored higher on the CSE, NBME exam, and performance evaluations (median, CSE:75.2 vs 68.7, shelf:68.0 vs 64.0, performance evaluation mean: 2.96 vs 2.78). The percentage of students with an honors was marginally higher in the group affected by COVID (42% vs 32%). Out of 19 students surveyed, 9 students responded. Seven students stated they would have preferred a closed-book CSE, citing a few drawbacks of the open-book format such as modifying their exam preparation, being discouraged from thinking prior to searching online during the test, and second guessing their answers. CONCLUSIONS: During the initial outbreak of COVID-19, we found that an open book exam and a virtually proctored shelf exam was a reasonable option. However, to avoid adjustments and student dissatisfaction, we would recommend virtual proctoring if available.","Prigoff, Jake; Hunter, Madeleine; Nowygrod, Roman",J. surg. educ,423,22

As a result of the pandemic, many older adults are now experiencing an increased and unprecedented amount of psychological stress. Physical activity has been found to be an evidence-based means of combating stress among older adults to promote their quality of life. Studies have demonstrated that those who are physically active experience fewer issues in regard to their mental health, specifically depression and anxiety disorders. Engagement in physical activity may exert a protective influence over stress inducing events and future mental health outcomes. Due to exercise being inexpensive, non-invasive, and effective even via incremental increases in activity level, physical activity interventions should be investigated as a therapy for reducing stress for older adults during the current pandemic. METHODS: Four electronic databases (PubMed, PsycInfo, Web of Science, and SportDiscus) will be searched to identify randomized controlled trials that evaluate the effectiveness of physical activity or exercise programs as a psychological stress management tool in adults 50 years of age or older. Only peer-reviewed and published journal articles will be reviewed. Post-intervention psychological stress measures in comparison to baseline stress will be the primary outcome of interest. All studies will be assessed for bias using Cochrane's risk of bias tool. A random effects meta-analysis will be investigated if sufficient evidence of homogenous research exists and the heterogeneity of effect sizes will be tabulated. DISCUSSION: This review will determine the effectiveness of various physical activity interventions for the treatment of psychological stress among the older adult population. This knowledge will help inform care aides, clinicians, family members, and older adults themselves of the most effective physical activity interventions in dealing with stress which is relevant to the ongoing pandemic.

However, a significant proportion of people report that they do not intend to have a vaccine, often because of concerns they have about vaccine side effects or safety. This study will assess the impact of theory-based messages on COVID-19 vaccination intention, drawing on the Necessity-Concerns framework to address previously reported beliefs and concerns about COVID-19 vaccination, and assess whether hypothesised variables (illness coherence, perceived necessity and concerns) mediate change in vaccination intention. TRIAL DESIGN: Prospective, parallel two-arm, individually randomised (1:1) trial. PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged over 18 years, living in Scotland and not vaccinated for COVID-19. A quota sampling approach will be used with the aim of achieving a nationally representative sample on gender, region and ethnic group, with oversampling of individuals with no educational qualifications or with only school-level qualifications. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Intervention: Brief exposure to online text and image-based messages addressing necessity beliefs and concerns about COVID-19 vaccination. Comparator: Brief exposure to online text and image-based messages containing general information about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccination. MAIN OUTCOMES: Primary outcome: Self-reported intention to receive a vaccine for COVID-19 if invited, immediately post-intervention. SECONDARY OUTCOMES: Self-reported COVID-19 illness coherence, perceived necessity of a COVID-19 vaccine and concerns about a COVID-19 vaccine, immediately post-intervention. RANDOMISATION: Quasi-randomisation performed automatically by online survey software, by creating a variable derived from the number of seconds in the minute that the participant initiates the survey. Participants starting the survey at 0-14 or 30-44 seconds in the minute are allocated to the intervention and 15-29 or 45-59 seconds to the comparator. BLINDING (MASKING): Participants will not be blinded to group assignment but will not be informed of the purpose of the study until they have completed the follow-up survey. Investigators will be blinded to allocation as all procedures will be undertaken digitally and remotely without any investigator contact with participants.

Primary healthcare teams (general practice and community nursing services) have provided the majority of this care, alongside specialist colleagues. There is a need to learn from this experience in order to inform future service delivery and planning. AIM: To understand the views of general practitioners and community nurses providing end-of-life care during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN & SETTING: A web-based, UK-wide questionnaire survey circulated via professional general practice and community nursing networks during September and October 2020. METHOD: Responses were analysed using descriptive statistics and an inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Valid responses were received from 559 individuals (387 community nurses, 156 General Practitioners (GPs) and 16 unspecified role), from all regions of the UK. The majority reported increased involvement in providing community end-of-life care. Contrasting and potentially conflicting roles emerged between GPs and community nurses. There was increased use of remote consultations, particularly by GPs. Community nurses took greater responsibility in most aspects of end-of-life care practice, particularly face-to-face care, but reported feeling isolated. For some GPs and community nurses, there has been considerable emotional distress. CONCLUSION: Primary healthcare services are playing a critical role in meeting increased need for end-of-life care in the community during the COVID-19 pandemic. They have adapted rapidly, but the significant emotional impact, especially for community nurses, needs addressing alongside rebuilding trusting and supportive team dynamics.","Mitchell, Sarah; Oliver, Phillip; Gardiner, Clare; Chapman, Helen; Khan, Dena; Boyd, Kirsty; Dale, Jeremy; Barclay, Stephen; Mayland, Catriona",,423,19

Financial assistance from the federal government has mainly been received by hospitals, which have borne the brunt of the COVID-19 illness. Some physician groups have, or are, receiving assistance through a few programs, although the accelerated and advance payments have been suspended. Employed surgeons are now being furloughed, terminated, or persuaded to agree to a significant cut in pay, forego bonuses, or take leave without pay as healthcare systems and some physician groups have started to experience the consequences of halting elective procedures. Newly hired surgeons might be forced in a few cases to agree to delays in starting their employment, new amendments, changes in employment status, and other terms for fear of losing their employment. In the present report, we have explained some agreement terminology and options available to allow physicians to understand the terms of their employment agreement and make their decisions after consulting with an expert healthcare attorney.","Satiani, Bhagwan; Davis, Carolyn A",J Vasc Surg,423,26

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: During containment in France because of COVID-19, the judicial authorities had to deal with the risk of contamination within immigration detention centers (IDC). In the Paris IDC, which can usually receive up to 240 individuals, measures have been taken to limit the risk of contamination by releasing individuals without prior judicial conviction and testing the others by a nasal swab. FINDINGS: The test was done for all the present individuals (48), except two who refused. Eight tests (17.4%) were positive and only one was symptomatic. Individuals testing positive for COVID-19 were transferred into COVID-centers specially created during this health crisis. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: Management of the COVID-19 epidemic in this French IDC illustrates the necessity of good cooperation between judicial authorities and medical teams in charge of those centers and the difficulty of balancing public health actions with state security.","Soussy, Nicolas; Dufayet, Laurène; Ravault, Etienne; Viron, Sophie; Gorgiard, Charlotte; Fournier, Lionel",International journal of prisoner health (Online),423,29

Dental amalgam is one of the most commonly used restorative materials in oral health care due to its strength and longevity (ref. 2). However, the use of mercury in an amalgam adds to global environmental mercury pollution and can contribute to adverse health effects on humans and other organisms. The outcomes of the COP-3 meeting included a call for information on the availability at a national scale, the economic and technical feasibility of alternatives, and the associated risks or benefits.

Traditionally, central venous catheters are inserted with patient in the supine or Trendelenburg position. However, when a patient cannot tolerate supine position and the need for central venous access is urgent, catheter placement may be considered with the patient in the prone position. CASE SUMMARY: A 69-year-old male with rapidly declining respiratory status secondary to COVID pneumonia quickly developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, was rapidly intubated, and then placed in the prone position. Patient could not tolerate the supine position even briefly and required a central venous catheter insertion for continuous renal replacement therapy. We kept the patient in the prone position and successfully inserted a central venous catheter in such position with real-time ultrasound guidance and using micropuncture technique. CONCLUSION: In the setting of the COVID pandemic, many cases of acute respiratory distress syndrome require patients to be prone in order to improve gas exchange. In the most severe situations, these patients would not be able to tolerate rotating back to the supine position but would still require central venous catheter insertion urgently. We demonstrated feasibility of central venous catheter insertion in the prone position in these severely ill patients.","Yang, Michael X; Ng, Philip K",J Intensive Care Med,423,8

Indeed, improvement of photocatalytic efficiencies by combining semiconductor and plasmonic nanostructures is one of the reasons why their ultrafast dynamics are intensively studied. In this work, we will review our activity on ultrafast spectroscopy in nanostructures carried out in the recently established EuroFEL Support Laboratory. We have investigated the dynamical plasmonic responses of metal NPs both in solution and in 2D and 3D arrays on surfaces, with particular attention being paid to the effects of the nanoparticle shape and to the conversion of absorbed light into heat on a nano-localized scale. We will summarize the results obtained on the carrier dynamics in nanostructured perovskites with emphasis on the hot-carrier dynamics and in semiconductor nanosystems such as ZnSe and Si nanowires, with particular attention to the band-gap bleaching dynamics. Subsequently, the study of semiconductor-metal NP hybrids, such as CeO$_2$-Ag NPs, ZnSe-Ag NPs and ZnSe-Au NPs, allows the discussion of interaction mechanisms such as charge carrier transfer and F{""o}rster interaction.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of data obtained from adult patients with a confirmed SARS-CoV2 infection having at least one SARS-CoV-2 pair of specific IgM/IgG tests, admitted in The University Hospital of Infectious Diseases Cluj-Napoca, Romania (28 February to 31 August 2020). The database also included: demographic, clinical, chest X-ray and/or CT scan results, RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2, and dexamethasone treatment. A total of 469 patients were evaluated as ""asymptomatic/mild"" and ""moderate/severe/critical"" cases. RESULTS: The median time since confirmation to SARS-CoV-2 PCR negativity was 15 days [95% CI: 13-18] in asymptomatic/mild cases and 17 days [95% CI: 16-21] in moderate/severe ones. The median time to seroconversion for both IgM and IgG was 13 days [95% CI: 13-14] in asymptomatic/mild cases and 11 days [95% CI: 10-13] in moderate/severe ones.

The results demonstrated that the crystallinity and morphology of the Cs3Cu2I5 films can be improved and the resistive switching performance can be modulated by adding an appropriate amount of HI. The obtained Cs3Cu2I5 films by adding 5 µL HI exhibit the fewest lattice defects and flattest surface (RMS = 13.3 nm). Besides, the memory device, utilizing the optimized films, has a low electroforming voltage (1.44 V), a large on/off ratio (â¼65), and a long retention time (104 s). The RS performance impacted by adding HI, providing a scientific strategy for improving the RS performance of iodine halide perovskite-based memories.","Zeng, Fanju; Tan, Yongqian; Hu, Wei; Tang, Xiaosheng; Luo, Zhongtao; Huang, Qiang; Guo, Yuanyang; Zhang, Xiaomei; Yin, Haifeng; Feng, Julin; Zhao, Xusheng; Yang, Ben",J Phys Chem Lett,423,20

It has been reported that COVID-19 has an effect on thyroid function. However, the association between thyroid function and prognosis of COVID-19 is still unclear.Methods: This retrospective study included patients with COVID-19 admitted to Tongji Hospital in Wuhan from January 28 to April 4, 2020. Demographic, epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data were collected from patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Patients without history of thyroid disease who had a thyroid function test at admission were enrolled in the final analysis. Risk factors of in-hospital death were explored using univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses. Survival differences were assessed with Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank test.Results: A total of 127 patients were included in this study, with 116 survivors and 11 non-survivors. The serum levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) [0.8 (0.5-1.7) vs. 1.9 (1.0-3.1) µIU/mL, P = .031] and free triiodothyronine (FT3) [2.9 (2.8-3.1) vs. 4.2 (3.5-4.7) pmol/L, P < .001] were lower in non-survivors than in survivors, and a low FT3 state (defined as FT3 < 3.1 pmol/L) at admission accounted for a higher proportion in non-survivors than in survivors (72.7% vs. 11.2%, P < .001). Univariate Cox regression analysis showed that FT3 level (HR 0.213, 95% CI: 0.101-0.451, P < .001) and the low FT3 state (HR 14.607, 95% CI: 3.873-55.081, P < .001) were negatively and positively associated with the risk of in-hospital death, respectively. Furthermore, multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that a low FT3 state was associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death after adjusting for confounding factors (HR 13.288, 95% CI: 1.089-162.110, P = .043). Moreover, Kaplan-Meier curves indicated a lower survival probability in COVID-19 patients with a low FT3 status.Conclusion: Serum FT3 level is lower in non-survivors among moderate-to-critical patients with COVID-19, and the low FT3 state is associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality of COVID-19.","Lang, Shan; Liu, Ye; Qu, Xue; Lu, Ran; Fu, Wei; Zhang, Wenhui; Wang, Haining; Hong, Tianpei",Endocr Res,423,16

Health care facilities will again be challenged by Covid-19 during heat waves. Health care personnel are also at risk of developing heat related health problems during hot periods due to the use of personal protective equipment to shield themselves from SARS-CoV-2 and must therefore be protected from excessive heat periods. Some existing recommendations for heat health protection contradict recommendations for COVID-19 protection.

Aim of this study is to evaluate mid-term clinical impact of COVID-19 on respiratory function. METHODS: 379 patients were evaluated 4â months after SARS-COV-2 diagnosis. Patients were divided in two groups based on the presence of pneumonia during COVID. Clinical conditions, quality of life, symptomatology, 6-min walking test, pulmonary function test with spirometry and diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide were analysed. Data were compared to clinical evolution during COVID (development of acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS], needing of invasive mechanical ventilation [IMV], partial oxygen saturation/ fraction of inspired oxygen [SpO2/FiO2] ratio and pneumonia severity index [PSI]). RESULTS: After a median of 135â days, 260 (68.6%) of 379 patients referred almost one symptom. Patients who developed pneumonia during COVID-19 showed lower SpO2 at rest (p<0.001), SpO2 during 6-min walking test (p<0.001), total lung capacity (p<0.001), airway occlusion pressure after 0.1â s [P0.1] (p=0.02), P0.1/maximal inspiratory pressure [MIP] ratio (p=0.005) and higher Borg category-ratio scale (p=0.006) and modified Medical Research Council breathlessness scale (p=0.003), compared to patients without pneumonia. SpO2/FiO2 ratio and PSI during SARS-COV-2 pneumonia were directly associated with mid-term alteration of partial oxygen saturation at rest (p<0.001), SpO2 during 6-min walking test (p<0.001), residual volume (p<0.001), total lung capacity (respectively p<0.001 and p=0.003) and forced vital capacity (respectively p=0.004, p=0.03).

However, the relationship between IARS2 and melanoma is still unclear. To evaluate the role of IARS2 in melanoma, we constructed a stable A375 cell line with IARS2 knockdown via lentivirus-mediated small interfering RNAs. The expression of IARS2 was measured by real time-quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction and western blot analysis. Cell counting, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, and colony formation assay were conducted to assess the effect of IARS2 on melanoma cell proliferation. Flow cytometry assay was used to determine cell apoptosis and cell cycle distribution in melanoma A375 cells. Finally, immunohistochemistry was employed to validate the expression of IARS2 protein in melanoma tissues. In this study it was found that IARS2 was highly expressed in melanoma cell lines. Furthermore, IARS2 protein also exhibited elevated expression in the tumour tissues obtained from melanoma patients. After suppression of the mRNA expression of IARS2, the proliferation and colony formation ability of the A375 cells were significantly inhibited, while the proportion of apoptotic A375 cells increased significantly, as indicated by an enhanced phosphatidylserine externalization and caspase 3/7 activity after IARS2 knockdown. Further investigations found that knockdown of IARS2 arrested cells in the G1 phase. The results suggested that IARS2 is critical for proliferation and apoptosis of melanoma cells.","Ma, Dongmei; Li, Song; Nie, Xiaojuan; Chen, Lamei; Chen, Nan; Hou, Dongsheng; Liu, Xiuhong; Gao, Binbin",Oncol Lett,423,29

Objective: This retrospective case-control study compared people with hypertension to matched healthy controls during the COVID-19 lockdown to determine whether they have higher risk perceptions, anxiety, and vaccination intentions. Methods: Baseline data from a national survey were collected in April 2020 during the COVID-19 lockdown in Australia. People who reported hypertension with no other chronic conditions were randomly matched to healthy controls of similar age, gender, education, and health literacy level. A subset including participants with hypertension was followed up at 2 months after restrictions were eased. Risk perceptions, anxiety, and vaccination intentions were measured in April and June. Results: Of the 4362 baseline participants, 466 (10.7%) reported hypertension with no other chronic conditions. A subset of 1369 people were followed up at 2 months, which included 147 (10.7%) participants with hypertension. At baseline, perceived seriousness was high for both hypertension and control groups. The hypertension group reported greater anxiety compared to the controls and were more willing to vaccinate against influenza, but COVID-19 vaccination intentions were similar. At follow-up, these differences were no longer present in the longitudinal subsample. Perceived seriousness and anxiety had decreased, but vaccination intentions for both influenza and COVID-19 remained high across groups (>80%). Conclusions: Anxiety was above normal levels during the COVID-19 lockdown. It was higher in the hypertension group, which also had higher vaccination intentions. Groups that are more vulnerable to COVID-19 may require targeted mental health screening during periods of greater risk. Despite a decrease in perceived risk and anxiety after 2 months of lockdown restrictions, vaccination intentions remained high, which is encouraging for the future prevention of COVID-19.","Bonner, Carissa; Cvejic, Erin; Ayre, Julie; Isautier, Jennifer; Semsarian, Christopher; Nickel, Brooke; Batcup, Carys; Pickles, Kristen; Dodd, Rachael; Cornell, Samuel; Copp, Tessa; McCaffery, Kirsten J",JMIRx Med,423,6

We aimed to evaluate and assess the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on management of diabetes and challenges faced by people with diabetes in India during and after the lockdown phase. METHODS: A cross-sectional study based on an online questionnaire survey was designed. The questions collected socio-demographic details, medical and social history, and impact of the pandemic on medical and social life from 1582 participants. Linear regression was employed to evaluate association of different parameters with the change in glycemic levels. RESULTS: The frequency of clinical visits during the COVID-19 pandemic were reduced in 87.28% of participants. 92.45% of participants were able to monitor their blood glucose levels (BGLs) in which 78.42% (49.35%, 20.91%, and 8.16%) participants experienced an increase in BGL (mild, moderate, and severe respectively). Only 47.41% of participants possessed the digital glucometer at home. 69.07% of participants reported a decrease in physical activity while 46.88% reported an increase in food intake. 80.06% of participants were able to buy all medicines and 29.80% were gone for virtual consultations while 87.81% reported that they didn't have access to healthcare services. Overall, 89.47% participants experienced disruption in therapy. A highly significant correlation (r = 0.89, p = 0.0145) was found between increasing age and reporting of higher BGLs. CONCLUSION: This study provides a firsthand evidence of major disruption in diabetes care activities during and after the lockdown phase in India and increased risk of poorer clinical outcomes, if infected by SARS-CoV-2.","Khader, Mohammed Abdul; Jabeen, Talha; Namoju, Ramanachary",Diabetes Metab Syndr,423,2

METHODS: This prospective study was conducted at eight medical centers from November 2010 to September 2013. Children aged 6 weeks to 18 years who met the radiologic criteria for pneumonia were enrolled. To detect classical and atypical bacteria and viruses, blood and pleural fluids were cultured, and respiratory specimens were examined by multiple conventional and molecular methods. RESULTS: At least one potential pathogen was identified in 705 (68.3%) cases of 1032 children enrolled, including bacteria in 420 (40.7%) cases, virus in 180 (17.4%) cases, and mixed viral-bacterial infection in 105 (10.2%) cases. Streptococcus pneumoniae (31.6%) was the most common pathogen, followed by Mycoplasma pneumoniae (22.6%). Adenovirus (5.9%) was the most common virus. RSV was significantly associated with children aged under 2 years, S. pneumoniae in children aged between 2 and 5 years, and M. pneumoniae in children aged >5 years. The annual incidence rate of hospitalization for CAP was highest in children aged 2-5 years (229.7 per 100,000). From 2011 to 2012, significant reduction in hospitalization rates pertained in children under 5 years of age, in pneumonia caused by pneumococcus, adenovirus or co-infections and complicated pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: CAP related pathogens have changed after increased conjugated pneumococcal vaccination rates.

Some COVID-19 patients experience sudden and rapid deterioration with the onset of fatal cytokine storm syndrome (CSS), which have increased interest in CSS's mechanisms, diagnosis and therapy. Although the prototypic concept of CSS was first proposed 116 years ago, we have only begun to study and understand CSS for less than 30 years. Actually, diseases under CSS umbrella include familial/primary and secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), infection-associated hemophagocytic syndrome, cytokine release syndrome (CRS), and cytokine storm (CS). Hematologic malignancies and autoimmune diseases that cause CSS are named malignancy-associated hemophagocytic syndrome (MAHS) and MAS, respectively. In-depth research on the pathogenesis of HLH/CSS has greatly increased the number of patients that were able to be definitively diagnosed with HLH/CSS. However, it should be emphasized that HLH/CSS diagnosis is difficult at the early stages due to the non-specific clinical signs and symptoms, which tends to result in missed and incorrect diagnoses. Therefore, clinicians should not only possess extensive clinical experience to ensure high sensitivity to the characteristics of HLH/CSS but must also be familiar with HLH-2004/2009 diagnostic criteria, and HScore methods. The paper concisely comment evolution of CSS classifications, cytokines associated with CSS, evolution of CSS diagnostic criteria and importance of the correct identification of hemophagocytes in diagnosing CSS, which is timely and may benefit clinicians familiar HLH-2004/2009 diagnostic criteria, and HScore methods. In addition, clinicians must also understand that there are some limitations to these diagnostic criteria.

Here, we update population trends, the distribution of rural and urban hospitals, and surgeon supply to estimate surgeon demand for rural and urban hospital settings by 2040. METHODS: Surgeon supply was based on new certifications for general surgery, orthopedic surgery, and obstetrics and gynecology adjusted for retirement. Surgeon demand from 2020 to 2040 was projected based on the US Census and published practice ratios: general surgery 10.7/100,000, orthopedic surgery 7.9/100,000, and obstetrics and gynecology 13.0/100,000. RESULTS: The US population grew from 309 million in 2011 to 327 million in 2017 with rural populations unchanged at 56 million. By 2040, the US population will be 374 million (urban 85% and rural 15%) creating shortages of general surgery (-31.5%), orthopedic surgery (-34.3%), and obstetrics and gynecology (-25.3). Future hiring needs for urban hospitals will be 5 times greater than rural hospitals. Urban hospitals will likely recruit most newly certified surgeons. CONCLUSION: Increases in surgery trainees will not meet the demand. The continued urbanization of American surgery may push rural hospitals into a vicious financial cycle leading to additional closures of rural hospitals and worsening issues of access. An alternative training paradigm for the rural surgeon is recommended to meet the unique demands of rural hospitals.","Ellison, E Christopher; Satiani, Bhagwan; Way, David P; Oslock, Wendelyn M; Santry, Heena; Williams, Thomas E",Surgery (St. Louis),423,6

Antimicrobial agents have been clinically proven to be effective in the pharmacological treatment of polymicrobial diseases. Unfortunately, an increasing trend in the emergence of multi-drug-resistant pathogens and limited options for delivery of antimicrobial drugs might seriously impact humans' efforts to combat polymicrobial diseases in the coming decades. New antimicrobial agents with novel mechanism(s) of action and new pharmaceutical formulations or delivery systems to target infected sites are urgently required. In this review, we discuss the prospective use of novel antimicrobial compounds isolated from natural products to treat polymicrobial infections, mainly via mechanisms related to inhibition of biofilm formation. Drug-delivery systems developed to deliver antimicrobial compounds to both intracellular and extracellular pathogens are discussed. We further discuss the effectiveness of several biofilm-targeted delivery strategies to eliminate polymicrobial biofilms. At the end, we review the applications and promising opportunities for various drug-delivery systems, when compared to conventional antimicrobial therapy, as a pharmacological means to treat polymicrobial diseases.","Sartini, Sartini; Permana, Andi Dian; Mitra, Saikat; Tareq, Abu Montakim; Salim, Emil; Ahmad, Islamudin; Harapan, Harapan; Emran, Talha Bin; Nainu, Firzan",,423,21

This study examined core emergency response competencies of Chinese nursing personnel related to the outbreak of major infectious diseases. METHODS: A survey was conducted among 960 nurses working in a tertiary hospital in Shanghai, China. Data were collected on core emergency response competencies of nursing personnel caring for patients with major infectious diseases, measuring overall competency as well as by dimensions of prevention ability, rescue ability, and preparation ability. A t-test and one-way analysis of variance were first analyzed for differences between groups, followed by multiple linear regression to analyze main influencing factors for core emergency response competencies. RESULTS: The average score for core emergency response competencies of nursing personnel delivering care to patients with major infectious diseases was 128.05 (SD 22.23) (range 36-180 points); or 71%, which is equivalent to moderate performance. Multiple linear regression analysis demonstrated that the main influencing factors for these nursing personnel were before participation in emergency drills for infectious diseases, current educational background, and working experience in the realm of infectious disease nursing. The final model explained 8.4% of the variance in core emergency response competencies. DISCUSSION: These findings indicate that it is necessary to strengthen the training of nursing staff with educational background deficits or no prior work or drill experience related to infectious diseases to effectively improve the core emergency response competencies of nursing personnel relative to infectious diseases.","Song, Shu; Li, Xueyan; Bell, Sue Anne; Yang, Xingjing; Zhang, Weiying",,423,26

METHODS: We examined the association between dexamethasone use and mortality at AP-HP Greater Paris University hospitals. Study baseline was defined as the date of hospital admission. The primary endpoint was time to death. We compared this endpoint between patients who received dexamethasone and those who did not in time-to-event analyses adjusted for patient characteristics (such as age, sex and comorbidity) and clinical and biological markers of clinical severity of COVID-19, and stratified by the need for respiratory support, i.e. mechanical ventilation or oxygen. The primary analysis was a multivariable Cox regression model. RESULTS: Of 12 217 adult patients hospitalized with a positive COVID-19 reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction test, 171 (1.4%) received dexamethasone orally or by intravenous perfusion during the visit. Among patients who required respiratory support, the end-point occurred in 10/63 (15.9%) patients who received dexamethasone and 298/1129 (26.4%) patients who did not. In this group, there was a significant association between dexamethasone use and reduced mortality in the primary analysis (hazard ratio, 0.46; 95% confidence interval 0.22-0.96, P = .039). Among patients who did not require respiratory support, there was no significant association between dexamethasone use and the endpoint.

It has been determined that the old population are not only at an increased risk for affliction with COVID-19 infection, but also atypical presentations, severe forms of the disease, and mortality are more common in this population. A plethora of mechanisms and risk factors contribute to the higher risk of infection in the old population. For instance, aging is associated with an increment in the expression of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE-2), the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which precipitates replication of the virus in the old population. On the other hand, immune dysregulation and changes in gut microbiota as a result of aging can contribute to the cytokine storm, one of the main indicators of disease severity. Decrement in sex steroids, especially in women, as well as growth hormone, both of which have crucial roles in immune regulation, is a key contributor to disease severity in old age. Senescence-associated oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in both pneumocytes and immune cells contribute to the severity of infection in an exacerbative manner. In addition, lifestyle-associated factors such as nutrition and physical activity, which are compromised in old age, are known as important factors in COVID-19 infection. Aging-associated comorbidities, especially cardiovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus, also put older adults at an increased risk of complications, and disease severity.","Farshbafnadi, Melina; Kamali Zonouzi, Sara; Sabahi, Mohammadmahdi; Dolatshahi, Mahsa; Aarabi, Mohammad Hadi",Exp Gerontol,423,24

Our aim is to describe the clinical characteristics of patients with HF hospitalized for COVID-19 and identify risk factors for in-hospital mortality upon admission. Methods We conducted a retrospective, multicenter study in patients with HF hospitalized for COVID-19 in 150 Spanish hospitals (SEMI-COVID-19 Registry). A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify admission factors associated with in-hospital mortality. Results A total of 1718 patients were analyzed (56.5% men;median age 81.4 years). The overall case fatality rate was 47.6% (n = 819). The independent risk factors at admission for in-hospital mortality were: age (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 1.03;95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 1.02–1.05;p Conclusions Patients with HF hospitalized for COVID-19 have a high in-hospital mortality rate.

METHODS: Seven nurse experts identified the linkages of NANDA-I, NOC and NIC for our work related to the COVID-19 pandemic. A model was developed to guide the project. The first step in creating linkages focused on the identification of nursing diagnoses. Then, for each nursing diagnosis, outcomes aligned with all components of the diagnosis were categorized and a list of nursing interventions was selected. The experts used their clinical judgment to make final decisions on the linkages selected in this study. FINDINGS: Two community level nursing diagnoses were identified as key problems appropriate for a pandemic related to COVID-19: Deficient Community Health and Ineffective Community Coping. For the nursing diagnosis Deficient Community Health, eight nursing outcomes and 12 nursing interventions were selected. In comparison for the nursing diagnosis, Ineffective Community Coping, nine nursing outcomes and 18 nursing interventions were identified. A total of40 concepts were identified for future development across the three classifications. CONCLUSIONS: The nursing diagnoses, outcomes and interventions selected during this linkage process provide knowledge to support the community challenged with responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, provide the opportunity to quantify the impact of nursing care, and enhance nursing practice by promoting the use of three standardized terminologies. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: NANDA-I, NOC and NIC linkages identified in this manuscript provide resources to support clinical decisions and care plan development for nurses practicing in the community.","Moorhead, Sue; Macieira, Tamara Gonçalves Rezende; Lopez, Karen Dunn; Mantovani, Vanessa Monteiro; Swanson, Elizabeth; Wagner, Cheryl; Abe, Noriko",International journal of nursing knowledge (Online),423,29

METHODS: multicenter, retrospective study with prospective follow-up of 160 middle-aged (35 to 65 years) patients with COVID-19. FIB-4, clinical and biochemical variables were collected at baseline. FIB-4 &#8805;2.67 defined patients with risk for advanced liver fibrosis. Through multivariate logistic regression and bootstrap analysis, independent predictors of intensive care unit admission for mechanical ventilation were identified. RESULTS: risk for advanced fibrosis was estimated in 28.1% of patients. Patients with FIB-4 &#8805;2.67 required more frequently mechanical ventilation (37.8% vs 18.3%; p= 0.009).

However, the countermeasures must be applied against the infection in this period until the targeted drugs became available. In this regard, the non-specific, broad-spectrum anti-viral means could be considered as a compromise allowing overcoming the period of trial. One way to enhance the ability to resist the infection is to activate the nonspecific immunity using a suitable driving-up agent, such as plant polysaccharides, particularly our drug Panavir isolated from the potato shoots. Earlier, we have shown the noticeable anti-viral and anti-bacterial activity of Panavir. Here we demonstrate the pro-inflammation activity of Panavir, which four-to-eight times intensified the ATP and MIF secretion by HL-60 cells. This effect was mediated by the active phagocytosis of the Panavir particles by the cells. We hypothesized the physiological basis of the Panavir proinflammatory activity is mediated by the indol-containing compounds (auxins) present in Panavir and acting as a plant analog of serotonin.","Stovbun, Sergey V; Kalinina, Tatiana S; Zlenko, Dmitry V; Kiselev, Aleksei V; Litvin, Alexander A; Bukhvostov, Alexander A; Usachev, Sergey V; Kuznetsov, Dmitry A",Int J Biol Macromol,423,1

We investigated the dissipation of three PPCPs: ibuprofen (IBP), diclofenac (DCF) and triclosan (TCS), separately and in mixtures, in the ppm range in biopurification system (BPS) microcosms, paying special attention to their effect on bacterial ecotoxicity, as well as bacterial community structure and composition. The results reveal that BPS microcosms efficiently dissipate IBP and DCF with 90% removed after 45 and 84 days of incubation, respectively. However, removal of TCS required a longer incubation period of 127 days for 90% removal. Furthermore, dissipation of the PPCPs was slower when a mixture of all three was applied to BPS microcosms. TCS had an initial negative effect on bacterial viability by a decrease of 34-43% as measured by live bacterial cell counts using LIVE/DEAD® microscopy; however, this effect was mitigated when the three PPCPs were present simultaneously. The bacterial communities in BPS microcosms were more affected by incubation time than by the PPCPs used. Nonetheless, the PPCPs differentially affected the composition and relative abundance of bacterial taxa. IBP and DCF initially increased bacterial diversity and richness, while exposure to TCS generally provoked an opposite effect without full recovery at the end of the incubation period. TCS, which negatively affected the relative abundance of Acidobacteria, Methylophilales, and Legionellales, had the largest impact on bacterial groups. Biomarker OTUs were identified in the BPS microcosms which were constrained to higher concentrations of the PPCPs and thus are likely to harbour degradation and/or detoxification mechanisms. This study reveals for the first time the effect of PPCPs on bacterial ecotoxicity and diversity in biopurification system microcosms and also facilitates the design of further applications of biomixtures to eliminate PPCPs.","Aguilar-Romero, Inés; Romero, Esperanza; Wittich, Regina-Michaela; van Dillewijn, Pieter",Sci Total Environ,423,24

Meanwhile, multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) has become a mainstream approach in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), but it remains unclear how NCs between voxels influence MVPA performance. Here, we tackle this issue by combining voxel-encoding modeling and MVPA. We focus on a well-established form of NC, tuning-compatible noise correlation (TCNC), whose sign and magnitude are systematically related to the tuning similarity between two units. We show that this form of voxelwise NCs can improve MVPA performance if NCs are sufficiently strong. We also confirm these results using standard information-theoretic analyses in computational neuroscience. In the same theoretical framework, we further demonstrate that the effects of noise correlations at both the neuronal level and the voxel level may manifest differently in typical fMRI data, and their effects are modulated by tuning heterogeneity. Our results provide a theoretical foundation to understand the effect of correlated activity on population codes in macroscopic fMRI data. Our results also suggest that future fMRI research could benefit from a closer examination of the correlational structure of multivariate responses, which is not directly revealed by conventional MVPA approaches.","Zhang, Ru-Yuan; Wei, Xue-Xin; Kay, Kendrick",PLoS Comput Biol,423,16

The plan included the implementation of 4 distance-based simulation training programs, with asynchronous personalized feedback. The courses allowed the acquisition of skills for the complete critical care patient management chain: use of personal protection equipment, use of a high-flow nasal cannula, endotracheal intubation, and prone positioning. Participants logged into the platform, reviewed material, practiced while recording the session, and uploaded the video through the training platform. The expert tutor remotely delivered asynchronous feedback. Participants trained remotely until achieving course approval.

In particular, to report on the systematic screening, quantitative assessment and critical appraisal of the first 10,000 scientific papers published on COVID-19 and to compare how scientific outputs matched identified research priorities and public health needs. METHODS: A comprehensive research strategy was developed to systematically retrieve on a daily basis all studies published on COVID-19. From included studies we extracted: bibliometric parameters, country of studies' implementation and study design. We assigned papers to 25 a priori defined COVID-19-related topics and we described scientific outputs in relation to countries' academic publishing ranking, as well as COVID-19 burden. RESULTS: 10,000 scientific articles were published on COVID-19 between 20th January and 7th May 2020, accounting for 2.3% of total scientific production over the study period. One third (33%) focused on COVID-19 clinical management, with little adherence to identified research priorities. Over sixty per cent of papers were opinion pieces not reporting original data. Papers were published on 1881 different journals but with half of scientific production included in 8% of journals. The US accounted for one fourth of total scientific production, followed by China (22.2%) and Italy (9%). CONCLUSIONS: Never before in the history of academic publishing such a great volume of research focused on a single topic, this being likely to introduce major changes in the way science is produced and communicated, at the risk of bringing it far from its ultimate aim: informing clinical and public health practice and decision making.","Odone, Anna; Salvati, Stefano; Bellini, Lorenzo; Bucci, Daria; Capraro, Michele; Gaetti, Giovanni; Amerio, Andrea; Signorelli, Carlo",Acta Biomed,423,20

FDP measurement has always played a key role in diagnosing DIC, a phenomenon that has recently gained renewed attention because of its occurrence in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Although the evaluation of FDP is crucial for the management of critical care, the variability among FDP reagents is unclear. In this study, we aimed to compare LIASAUTO P-FDP with three FDP reagents and investigate their characteristics. METHODS: In total, 172 plasmas samples were used in the correlation. The sample data were divided into three groups including negative, no and positive discrepancy based on the discrepancy percentages calculated from each correlation between LIASAUTO P-FDP and other three reagents. D-dimer, plasmin-&#945;2 plasmin inhibitor complex (PIC), fibrin monomer complex (FMC), fibrinogen (Fbg) and Plasmin-&#945;2 Plasmin Inhibitor (&#945;2 PI) were measured and included in data analysis. RESULTS: The positive discrepancy groups showed higher D-dimer, PIC and FMC values than the negative discrepancy groups. The data indicated that LIASAUTO P-FDP had higher reactivity to D-dimer than other reagents and the values were elevated in the fibrinolysis-enhanced samples with various FDP fragments. CONCLUSION: LIASAUTO P-FDP displayed the reactivity towards various fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products, and it might be useful for DIC diagnosis because the fibrinolytic status differed in the DIC types and stages.","Kumano, Osamu; Ieko, Masahiro; Komiyama, Yutaka; Naito, Sumiyoshi; Yoshida, Mika; Takahashi, Nobuhiko; Ohmura, Kazumasa; Hayakawa, Mineji",Int. j. lab. hematol,423,28

We analyzed their epidemiological characteristics, clinical and radiological features, laboratory results, and treatment. Results: Of the 141 patients (49 females, 92 males), the median age was 77 years (range: 24-92 years). The most likely source of exposure included the Huanan seafood market (n=3, 2%), family members (n=6, 4%), and hospital-acquired infection (n=8, 6%). The remaining 116 patients (72%) had no known source of exposure. Of the patients, 101 (72%) had chronic diseases. The most common comorbidities were hypertension, diabetes and coronary heart disease. The most common clinical manifestations were fever (n=121, 85%), dry cough (n=77, 54%), shortness of breath (n=23, 16%), and chest pain (n=15, 10%). Less common clinical manifestations included fatigue (n=7, 4%), headache (n=3, 2%), disorders of consciousness (n=2, 1%), diarrhea (n=2, 1%) and lumbago (n=1, 0.7%). In terms of laboratory tests, the absolute value of lymphocytes in most patients was reduced (n=132, 94%), but C-reactive protein (n=141, 100%), procalcitonin(n=121, 89%), serum amyloid (n=140, 99%) were significantly increased. The most common findings on imaging of the lungs were bilateral multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity (n=101, 72%), mainly in the lower lobes (n=15, 10%), with lesions being more common on the right. Other imaging findings included diffuse consolidation (n=4, 3%), ground-glass opacity and consolidation (n=20, 14%), and pneumothorax (n=1, 0.7%). All patients were treated with antibiotics and antiviral drugs. Other treatments included immunoglobulin (n=49, 35%), corticosteroids (n=45, 32%), continuous renal replacement therapy (n=24, 17%), and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (n=12, 9%). All patients were treated with oxygen therapy. The mode of administration included invasive mechanical ventilation (n=61, 43%), noninvasive mechanical ventilation (n=65, 46%), and nasal catheter oxygen inhalation (n=15, 11%). The direct causes of death were acute respiratory distress syndrome (n=90, 64%), multiple organ failure (n=24, 17%), sudden cardiac arrest (n=11, 8%), viral myocarditis (n=8, 5%), acute myocardial infarction (n=4, 3%), cerebrovascular accident (n=3, 2%), and acute gastrointestinal bleeding (n=1, 0.7%). Conclusions: Risk factors for death due to COVID-19 included older age, male sex, and the presence of comorbidities.

It has been moreover speculated that this neurotropism could potentially cause a delayed outbreak of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases of neuroinflammatory origin. A propagation mechanism has been proposed across the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone, from the nose to the olfactory epithelium, and possibly afterward to other limbic structures, and deeper parts of the brain including the brainstem. METHODS: Review of clinical examination, and whole-brain voxel-based analysis of 18F-FDG PET metabolism in comparison with healthy subjects (p voxel < 0.001, p-cluster < 0.05, uncorrected), of two patients with confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 explored at the post-viral stage of the disease. RESULTS: Hypometabolism of the olfactory/rectus gyrus was found on the two patients, especially one with 4-week prolonged anosmia. Additional hypometabolisms were found within amygdala, hippocampus, parahippocampus, cingulate cortex, pre-/post-central gyrus, thalamus/hypothalamus, cerebellum, pons, and medulla in the other patient who complained of delayed onset of a painful syndrome. CONCLUSION: These preliminary findings reinforce the hypotheses of SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism through the olfactory bulb and the possible extension of this impairment to other brain structures. 18F-FDG PET hypometabolism could constitute a cerebral quantitative biomarker of this involvement. Post-viral cohort studies are required to specify the exact relationship between such hypometabolisms and the possible persistent disorders, especially involving cognitive or emotion disturbances, residual respiratory symptoms, or painful complaints.","Guedj, E; Million, M; Dudouet, P; Tissot-Dupont, H; Bregeon, F; Cammilleri, S; Raoult, D",Eur. j. nucl. med. mol. imaging,423,1

In particular, recent evidence has suggested a decrease in vascular function in the arms and legs which may persist for some time following recovery from SARS-CoV-2. Methods We have assessed vascular function in 7 young healthy adults (4M/3F, 20±1y, 174±12cm, 72±8kg) who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Using Doppler ultrasound, brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) in the arm and single passive limb movement (sPLM) in the leg were assessed as markers of vascular function at baseline (3-4 weeks after testing positive for SARS-CoV-2) and at 1-month and 2-month follow up testing visits. Data are mean±SD. Results The sum of shear at peak brachial artery vasodilation decreased from baseline (81,369±35,101AU) to the 2-month follow up visit (50,584±36,606AU) (p&lt;0.05).

The SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 lineage was first identified in South Africa (2) and might be neutralized less effectively by antibodies produced after vaccination or natural infection with other strains (3-6). To limit SARS-CoV-2 chains of transmission associated with this index patient, MDH used contact tracing to identify the source of infection and any linked infections among other persons. The investigation identified two linked clusters of SARS-CoV-2 infection that included 17 patients. Three additional specimens from these clusters were sequenced; all three had the B.1.351 variant and all sequences were closely related to the sequence from the index patient's specimen. Among the 17 patients identified, none reported recent international travel or contact with international travelers. Two patients, including the index patient, had received the first of a 2-dose COVID-19 vaccination series in the 2 weeks before their likely exposure; one additional patient had a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection 5 months before exposure. Two patients were hospitalized with COVID-19, and one died. These first identified linked clusters of B.1.351 infections in the United States with no apparent link to international travel highlight the importance of expanding the scope and volume of genetic surveillance programs to identify variants, completing contact investigations for SARS-CoV-2 infections, and using universal prevention strategies, including vaccination, masking, and physical distancing, to control the spread of variants of concern.","Feder, Kenneth A; Pearlowitz, Marcia; Goode, Alexandra; Duwell, Monique; Williams, Thelonious W; Chen-Carrington, Ping An; Patel, Ami; Dominguez, Catherine; Keller, Eric N; Klein, Liore; Rivera-Colon, Alessandra; Mostafa, Heba H; Morris, C Paul; Patel, Neil; Schauer, Anna M; Myers, Robert; Blythe, David; Feldman, Katherine A",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,423,16

Classification of patients with influenza-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (IAPA) using the current definitions for invasive fungal diseases has proven difficult, and our aim was to develop case definitions for IAPA that can facilitate clinical studies. METHODS: A group of 29 international experts reviewed current insights into the epidemiology, diagnosis and management of IAPA and proposed a case definition of IAPA through a process of informal consensus. RESULTS: Since IAPA may develop in a wide range of hosts, an entry criterion was proposed and not host factors. The entry criterion was defined as a patient requiring ICU admission for respiratory distress with a positive influenza test temporally related to ICU admission. In addition, proven IAPA required histological evidence of invasive septate hyphae and mycological evidence for Aspergillus. Probable IAPA required the detection of galactomannan or positive Aspergillus culture in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or serum with pulmonary infiltrates or a positive culture in upper respiratory samples with bronchoscopic evidence for tracheobronchitis or cavitating pulmonary infiltrates of recent onset. The IAPA case definitions may be useful to classify patients with COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA), while awaiting further studies that provide more insight into the interaction between Aspergillus and the SARS-CoV-2-infected lung. CONCLUSION: A consensus case definition of IAPA is proposed, which will facilitate research into the epidemiology, diagnosis and management of this emerging acute and severe Aspergillus disease, and may be of use to study CAPA.","Verweij, Paul E; Rijnders, Bart J A; Brüggemann, Roger J M; Azoulay, Elie; Bassetti, Matteo; Blot, Stijn; Calandra, Thierry; Clancy, Cornelius J; Cornely, Oliver A; Chiller, Tom; Depuydt, Pieter; Giacobbe, Daniele Roberto; Janssen, Nico A F; Kullberg, Bart-Jan; Lagrou, Katrien; Lass-Flörl, Cornelia; Lewis, Russell E; Liu, Peter Wei-Lun; Lortholary, Olivier; Maertens, Johan; Martin-Loeches, Ignacio; Nguyen, M Hong; Patterson, Thomas F; Rogers, Thomas R; Schouten, Jeroen A; Spriet, Isabel; Vanderbeke, Lore; Wauters, Joost; van de Veerdonk, Frank L",Intensive Care Med,423,1

The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binds primarily to ACE2 on target cells and is then processed by membrane proteases, including TMPRSS2, leading to viral internalisation or fusion with the plasma membrane. It has been suggested, however, that receptors other than ACE2 may be involved in virus binding. We have investigated the interactions of recombinant versions of the spike protein with human epithelial cell lines that express low/very low levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in a proxy assay for interaction with host cells. A tagged form of the spike protein containing the S1 and S2 regions bound in a temperature-dependent manner to all cell lines, whereas the S1 region alone and the receptor-binding domain (RBD) interacted only weakly. Spike protein associated with cells independently of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, while RBD required the presence of high levels of ACE2 for interaction. As the spike protein has previously been shown to bind heparin, a soluble glycosaminoglycan, we tested the effects of various heparins on ACE2-independent spike protein interaction with cells. Unfractionated heparin inhibited spike protein interaction with an IC50 value of <0.05 U/mL, whereas two low-molecular-weight heparins were less effective. A mutant form of the spike protein, lacking the arginine-rich putative furin cleavage site, interacted only weakly with cells and had a lower affinity for unfractionated and low-molecular-weight heparin than the wild-type spike protein. This suggests that the furin cleavage site might also be a heparin-binding site and potentially important for interactions with host cells. The glycosaminoglycans heparan sulphate and dermatan sulphate, but not chondroitin sulphate, also inhibited the binding of spike protein, indicating that it might bind to one or both of these glycosaminoglycans on the surface of target cells.","Partridge, Lynda J; Urwin, Lucy; Nicklin, Martin J H; James, David C; Green, Luke R; Monk, Peter N",,423,1

Pa-COVID-19 aims to provide comprehensive data on clinical course, pathophysiology, immunology and outcome of COVID-19, to identify prognostic biomarkers, clinical scores, and therapeutic targets for improved clinical management and preventive interventions. METHODS: Pa-COVID-19 is a prospective observational cohort study of patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection treated at Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin. We collect data on epidemiology, demography, medical history, symptoms, clinical course, and pathogen testing and treatment. Systematic, serial blood sampling will allow deep molecular and immunological phenotyping, transcriptomic profiling, and comprehensive biobanking. Longitudinal data and sample collection during hospitalization will be supplemented by long-term follow-up. RESULTS: Outcome measures include the WHO clinical ordinal scale on day 15 and clinical, functional, and health-related quality-of-life assessments at discharge and during follow-up. We developed a scalable dataset to (i) suit national standards of care, (ii) facilitate comprehensive data collection in medical care facilities with varying resources, and (iii) allow for rapid implementation of interventional trials based on the standardized study design and data collection. We propose this scalable protocol as blueprint for harmonized data collection and deep phenotyping in COVID-19 in Germany. CONCLUSION: We established a basic platform for harmonized, scalable data collection, pathophysiological analysis, and deep phenotyping of COVID-19, which enables rapid generation of evidence for improved medical care and identification of candidate therapeutic and preventive strategies.

Dermatology had to re-prioritize visits, guarantee urgent care, and ensure continuity for chronic patients. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the COVID-19 impact on dermatologic surgery outpatient management. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this real-life retrospective observational study, we evaluated both major and minor outpatient surgeries (MaOS and MiOS) performance in 2020, before and during the first month of lockdown declaration, in a primary referral center in Northern Italy. During the lockdown, all lifesaving and cancer surgery, (approximately 80% of our usual activities), were continued. Data from 2020 were compared with the 2019 corresponding periods to assess the real-life impact of COVID-19 in dermatologic surgical activities. RESULTS: From January 1st to April 3rd, 2020 we performed 769 interventions, compared to 908 over the corresponding 2019 period. After the lockdown, scheduled surgeries were reduced by 14.8%; overall performed ones displayed a reduction of 46.5% (51.6% MaOS, 44.2% MiOS). 52.9% and 12.5% procedures were canceled due to patients' renunciation and due to confirmed/suspected COVID-19, respectively.

SA has implemented a 5-stage Risk-Adjusted Strategy which includes a phased national lockdown, requiring social distancing, frequent hand washing and wearing face masks. Strict adherence to this strategy is crucial to reducing COVID-19 transmission, flattening the curve, and preventing resurgence. As part of the 22-country International Citizens Project COVID-19 (ICPcovid), this study aimed to describe the SA adherence to the Risk-Adjusted Strategy and identify determinants of adherence. METHOD: During 24 April-15 May 2020, people were electronically invited, through social media platforms and a text blast, to complete an online survey, accessible via www.icpcovid.com. The survey investigated COVID-19 testing and preventative adherence measures, then used logistic regression analysis to identify predictors of adherence. RESULTS: There were 951 participants, with 731(76.9%) 25 to 54 years. Most (672;70.7%) were female, and 705(74.1%) had a university degree. Since the epidemic started, 529(55.6%) and 436(45.9%) participants stated they were eating healthier and taking more vitamins, respectively. Only 82(8.6%) had been COVID-19 tested, and 1(1.2%) tested positive. In public, 905(95.2%) socially distanced, however 99(10.4%) participants had recently attended meetings with over ten people. Regular hand washing was practiced by 907(95.4%) participants, 774(81.4%) wore face masks and 854(89.8%) stayed home when they experienced flu-like symptoms. The odds of adhering to the guidelines were lower among men versus women (AOR 0.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.528, 0.971) and those who had flu-like symptoms (AOR 0.42, 95% CI = 0.277, 0.628). In contrast, increased odds were reported for those who reported increased vitamin intake (AOR 1.37, 95% CI = 1.044,1.798), and were either cohabiting or married (AOR 1.39, 95% CI = 1.042,1.847). CONCLUSION: Despite high reported adherence, face mask use and symptomatic individuals not self-isolating, were areas for improvement. However, these factors cannot solely account for SA's increasing COVID-19 cases. Larger general population studies are needed to identify other adherence predictors for a strengthened SA COVID-19 response. While the government must continue to educate the entire population on preventative measures, provide personal protective equipment and stress the importance of adherence, there also needs to be implementation of prioritised prevention strategies for men and single individuals to address their demonstrated lower adherence.","Majam, Mohammed; Fischer, Alex; Phiri, Jane; Venter, Francois; Lalla-Edward, Samanta T",PLoS One,423,16

The dominant route of cell entry of the coronavirus is via phagocytosis, with ensconcement in endosomes thereafter proceeding via the endosomal pathway, involving transfer from early (EEs) to late endosomes (LEs) and ultimately into lysosomes via endolysosomal fusion. EE to LE transportation is a rate-limiting step for coronaviruses. Hence inhibition or dysregulation of endosomal trafficking could potentially inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. Furthermore, the acidic luminal pH of the endolysosomal system is critical for the activity of numerous pH-sensitive hydrolytic enzymes. Golgi sub-compartments and Golgi-derived secretory vesicles also depend on being mildly acidic for optimal function and structure. Activation of endosomal toll-like receptors by viral RNA can upregulate inflammatory mediators and contribute to a systemic inflammatory cytokine storm, associated with a worsened clinical outcome in COVID-19. Such endosomal toll-like receptors could be inhibited by the use of pharmacological agents which increase endosomal pH, thereby reducing the activity of acid-dependent endosomal proteases required for their activity and/or assembly, leading to suppression of antigen-presenting cell activity, decreased autoantibody secretion, decreased nuclear factor-kappa B activity and decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine production. It is also noteworthy that SARS-CoV-2 inhibits autophagy, predisposing infected cells to apoptosis. It is therefore also suggested that further pharmacological inhibition of autophagy might encourage the apoptotic clearance of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells.","Morris, Gerwyn; Athan, Eugene; Walder, Ken; Bortolasci, Chiara C; O039,; Neil, Adrienne; Marx, Wolf; Berk, Michael; Carvalho, André F; Maes, Michael; Puri, Basant K",Life Sci,423,2

A major problem in its cure is its early screening and detection, which will decide on its treatment. Due to the fast contactless spreading of the virus, its screening is unusually difficult. Moreover, the results of COVID-19 tests may take up to 48 h. That is enough time for the virus to worsen the health of the affected person. The health community needs effective means for identification of the virus in the shortest possible time. In this study, we invent a medical device utilized consisting of composable sensors to monitor remotely and in real-time the health status of those who have symptoms of the coronavirus or those infected with it. The device comprises wearable medical sensors integrated using the Arduino hardware interfacing and a smartphone application. An IoT framework is deployed at the backend through which various devices can communicate in real-time. The medical device is applied to determine the patient's critical status of the effects of the coronavirus or its symptoms using heartbeat, cough, temperature and Oxygen concentration (SpO2) that are evaluated using our custom algorithm. Until now, it has been found that many coronavirus patients remain asymptomatic, but in case of known symptoms, a person can be quickly identified with our device. It also allows doctors to examine their patients without the need for physical direct contact with them to reduce the possibility of infection. Our solution uses rule-based decision-making based on the physiological data of a person obtained through sensors. These rules allow to classify a person as healthy or having a possibility of infection by the coronavirus. The advantage of using rules for patient's classification is that the rules can be updated as new findings emerge from time to time. In this article, we explain the details of the sensors, the smartphone application, and the associated IoT framework for real-time, remote screening of COVID-19.","Mukhtar, Hamid; Rubaiee, Saeed; Krichen, Moez; Alroobaea, Roobaea",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),423,24

It combines point-of-care diagnosis with next-generation sequencing, aiming to achieve population-scale testing. Stage 1 allows a quick decentralized readout for early isolation of presymptomatic or asymptomatic patients. It gives results within 1 to 2 hours, using either fluorescence detection or a lateral flow readout, while simultaneously incorporating sample-specific barcodes. The same reaction products from potentially hundreds of thousands of samples can then be pooled and used in a highly multiplexed sequencing-based assay in stage 2. This second stage confirms the near-patient testing results and facilitates centralized data collection. The 95% limit of detection is <50 copies of viral RNA per reaction. INSIGHT is suitable for further development into a rapid home-based, point-of-care assay and is potentially scalable to the population level.","Wu, Qianxin; Suo, Chenqu; Brown, Tom; Wang, Tengyao; Teichmann, Sarah A; Bassett, Andrew R",Sci.

However, there is not a systematic evaluation of all aspects of this association. Therefore, this meta-analysis aimed to assess the association between all underlying comorbidities in COVID-19 infection severity. METHODS: Electronic literature search was performed via scientific search engines. After the removal of duplicates and selection of articles of interest, 28 studies were included. A fixed-effects model was used; however, if heterogeneity was high (I2 > 50%) a random-effects model was applied to combine the data. RESULTS: A total of 6,270 individuals were assessed (1,615 severe and 4,655 non-severe patients). The median age was 63 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 49-74) and 47 (95% CI: 19-63) years in the severe and non-severe groups, respectively. Moreover, about 41% of patients had comorbidities. Severity was higher in patients with a history of cerebrovascular disease: OR 4.85 (95% CI: 3.11-7.57). The odds of being in a severe group increase by 4.81 (95% CI: 3.43-6.74) for a history of cardiovascular disease (CVD). This was 4.19 (95% CI: 2.84-6.19) for chronic lung disease and 3.18, 95% CI: 2.09-4.82 for cancer. The odds ratios of diabetes and hypertension were 2.61 (95% CI: 2.02-3.3) and 2.37 (95% CI: 1.80-3.13), respectively.

These communities have long faced barriers to health care access, challenges due to immigration status, and financial and labor instability. The COVID-19 pandemic has aggravated these existing issues in a vulnerable, often forgotten, immigrant community. It has been challenging for this population to access public information regarding COVID-19 testing, treatment, and assistance programs because this information has seldom been disseminated in Spanish and even less frequently in Portuguese. While long-term solutions will require time and changes to policy, some short-term measures can mitigate the current situation. The authors share their experience from Newark, New Jersey, where partnerships of public and private community-based organizations (CBOs) have been successful in establishing trust between the health care system and a fearful Latino community. The Ironbound Initiative, a student group at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School in Newark, New Jersey, has partnered with Mantena Global Care, a Brazilian CBO in Newark, to facilitate dissemination of COVID-19-relevant information. Medical student volunteers, removed from their clinical duties, serve as virtual patient navigators, using social media to reach community members with the goals of improving awareness of precautions to take during the pandemic and of increasing access to needed medical care. These students have collaborated with colleagues in other disciplines to provide necessary legal guidance to community members fearful of seeking care because of their immigration status. The authors urge other academic institutions across the country to recruit multidisciplinary teams of medical, health professions, and law students invested in their local communities and to empower students to partner with CBOs, immigrant community leaders, faith-based organizations, hospitals, and local authorities to support these vulnerable communities during this crisis.","Behbahani, Sara; Smith, Cynthia A; Carvalho, Michelly; Warren, Christopher J; Gregory, Micah; Silva, Nicole A",Acad Med,423,33

However, a gender vision of health begs the question: Why are pregnant women not considered a risk group for COVID-19? The answer is clear: historically, most community scientific studies have not considered female gender, or pregnancy as a state, to be a focus of special interest or effort. Unfortunately, this bias seems to be maintained in the COVID-19 epidemic: most current guidelines for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy apply the same standard criteria as for the general population. This pandemic is an opportunity to begin redressing this historic gender bias against pregnant women, and to achieve this, we recommend two actions that are easy to implement, and would have a large impact. First, routinely test for SARS-CoV-2 infection in all pregnant women with clinical or epidemiological suspicion, regardless of gestational age or the clinical severity. Second, routinely test for SARS-CoV-2 infection in all pregnant women at admission for delivery. These actions are essential to understand the true impact of COVID-19 throughout pregnancy, and will improve how we manage many aspects of pre- and postnatal care. It is the scientific community's responsibility to guide, even to anticipate, the recommendations of our respective governments' health policies. If we do not agree to consider pregnant women as a distinct priority subgroup of the population during this pandemic, once again we will miss an opportunity to overcome this historic bias.","Comas, Carmina; Carreras, Elena",J. med. virol,423,16

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the impact of the use of big data analytics on people's health based on the health indicators and core priorities in the World Health Organization (WHO) General Programme of Work 2019/2023 and the European Programme of Work (EPW), approved and adopted by its Member States, in addition to SARS-CoV-2-related studies. Furthermore, we sought to identify the most relevant challenges and opportunities of these tools with respect to people's health. METHODS: Six databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews via Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus, and Epistemonikos) were searched from the inception date to September 21, 2020. Systematic reviews assessing the effects of big data analytics on health indicators were included. Two authors independently performed screening, selection, data extraction, and quality assessment using the AMSTAR-2 (A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews 2) checklist. RESULTS: The literature search initially yielded 185 records, 35 of which met the inclusion criteria, involving more than 5,000,000 patients. Most of the included studies used patient data collected from electronic health records, hospital information systems, private patient databases, and imaging datasets, and involved the use of big data analytics for noncommunicable diseases. ""Probability of dying from any of cardiovascular, cancer, diabetes or chronic renal disease"" and ""suicide mortality rate"" were the most commonly assessed health indicators and core priorities within the WHO General Programme of Work 2019/2023 and the EPW 2020/2025. Big data analytics have shown moderate to high accuracy for the diagnosis and prediction of complications of diabetes mellitus as well as for the diagnosis and classification of mental disorders; prediction of suicide attempts and behaviors; and the diagnosis, treatment, and prediction of important clinical outcomes of several chronic diseases. Confidence in the results was rated as ""critically low"" for 25 reviews, as ""low"" for 7 reviews, and as ""moderate"" for 3 reviews. The most frequently identified challenges were establishment of a well-designed and structured data source, and a secure, transparent, and standardized database for patient data. CONCLUSIONS: Although the overall quality of included studies was limited, big data analytics has shown moderate to high accuracy for the diagnosis of certain diseases, improvement in managing chronic diseases, and support for prompt and real-time analyses of large sets of varied input data to diagnose and predict disease outcomes.

Although great progress has been made in the development of effective countermeasures, with several pharmaceutical companies approved or poised to deliver vaccines to market, there is still an unmet need of essential antiviral drugs with therapeutic impact for the treatment of moderate-to-severe COVID-19. Towards this goal, a high-throughput assay was used to screen SARS-CoV-2 nsp15 uracil-dependent endonuclease (endoU) function against 13 thousand compounds from drug and lead repurposing compound libraries. While over 80% of initial hit compounds were pan-assay inhibitory compounds, three hits were confirmed as nsp15 endoU inhibitors in the 1-20 µM range in vitro. Furthermore, Exebryl-1, a ß-amyloid anti-aggregation molecule for Alzheimer's therapy, was shown to have antiviral activity between 10 to 66 µM, in Vero 76, Caco-2, and Calu-3 cells. Although the inhibitory concentrations determined for Exebryl-1 exceed those recommended for therapeutic intervention, our findings show great promise for further optimization of Exebryl-1 as an nsp15 endoU inhibitor and as a SARS-CoV-2 antiviral.","Choi, Ryan; Zhou, Mowei; Shek, Roger; Wilson, Jesse W; Tillery, Logan; Craig, Justin K; Salukhe, Indraneel A; Hickson, Sarah E; Kumar, Neeraj; James, Rhema M; Buchko, Garry W; Wu, Ruilian; Huff, Sydney; Nguyen, Tu-Trinh; Hurst, Brett L; Cherry, Sara; Barrett, Lynn K; Hyde, Jennifer L; Van Voorhis, Wesley C",PLoS One,423,8

It has exposed a serious primary care shortage, the unreliability of employer-sponsored health insurance, systemic racism, and other dysfunctions of a system turned on its head without a primary care base. Fundamental reform is urgently needed to bring affordable health care that is accessible to all Americans. Over the last 40-plus years, our supposed system has been taken over by corporate stakeholders with the presumption that a competitive unfettered marketplace will achieve the needed goal of affordable, accessible care. That theory has been thoroughly disproven by experience as the ranks of more than 30 million uninsured and 87 million underinsured demonstrates. Three main reform alternatives before us are: (1) to build on the Affordable Care Act; (2) to implement some kind of a public option; and (3) to enact single-payer Medicare for All. It is only the third option that can make affordable, comprehensive health care accessible for our entire population. As the debate goes forward over these alternatives during this election season, the likelihood of major change through a new system of national health insurance is becoming increasingly realistic. Rebuilding primary care and public health is a high priority as we face a new normal in US health care that places the public interest above that of corporate stakeholders and Wall Street investors. Primary care, and especially family medicine, should become the foundation of a reformed health care system.","Geyman, John P",Fam Med,423,17

We identify key steps in this journey and important questions we faced. We explain the decisions we made and discuss the consequences of those decisions, highlighting what worked well and what might have gone better. The CATS Project is creating and validating two concept inventories---conceptual tests of understanding---that can be used to measure the effectiveness of various approaches to teaching and learning cybersecurity. The Cybersecurity Concept Inventory (CCI) is for students who have recently completed any first course in cybersecurity; the Cybersecurity Curriculum Assessment (CCA) is for students who have recently completed an undergraduate major or track in cybersecurity. Each assessment tool comprises 25 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) of various difficulties that target the same five core concepts, but the CCA assumes greater technical background. Key steps include defining project scope, identifying the core concepts, uncovering student misconceptions, creating scenarios, drafting question stems, developing distractor answer choices, generating educational materials, performing expert reviews, recruiting student subjects, organizing workshops, building community acceptance, forming a team and nurturing collaboration, adopting tools, and obtaining and using funding. Creating effective MCQs is difficult and time-consuming, and cybersecurity presents special challenges. Because cybersecurity issues are often subtle, where the adversarial model and details matter greatly, it is challenging to construct MCQs for which there is exactly one best but non-obvious answer. We hope that our experiences and lessons learned may help others create more effective concept inventories and assessments in STEM.","Sherman, Alan T.; Herman, Geoffrey L.; Oliva, Linda; Peterson, Peter A.

The COVID-19 pandemic, which began in early 2020, exposed significant shortcomings of the Russian healthcare reform, showing serious problems in the shortage of specialists, hospital beds, protective equipment, ventilators, tests, and medicines. The reduction of hospital beds and the number of infectious diseases doctors in order to increase the average salary in healthcare has led to the inability of the Russian healthcare system to cope with the spread of coronavirus infection without involving residents, professors, teachers and students of medical organizations. At the present stage of development, the issues of combating the spread of coronavirus infection, mobilization and professional training of medical workers are of particular relevance. Nevertheless, despite the results of the health care reform, which led to a massive reduction of medical organizations in our country, the number of doctors per 10,000 people in 2018 was 47.9 employees, over the past 20 years, has not changed much in the direction of reduction. In our view, we should not talk about a global reduction in human resources in healthcare. The existing personnel problems in healthcare are the low qualification of medical personnel and the General shortage of specialists in the labor market.","Aksenova, E I; Vashalomidze, E V; Vishnevskaya, N G; Guskova, I V; Filimonova, I V",Probl Sotsialnoi Gig Zdravookhranenniiai Istor Med,423,26

Of these three percent, individuals with the highest anti-S or anti-RBD IgG level showed a strong correlation with inhibition of ACE2 binding and cross-reactivity against non-SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus S-proteins. We also analyzed samples from 94 SARS-CoV-2 patients and compared them to asymptomatic individuals. SARS-CoV-2 symptomatic patients had decreased antibody responses, ACE2 binding inhibition, and antibody cross-reactivity. Our study shows that healthy individuals can mount robust immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 without symptoms. Further, IgG antibody responses against S and RBD may correlate with high inhibition of ACE2 binding in individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination.","Dwyer, Connor J; Cloud, Colleen A; Wang, Cindy; Heidt, Philip; Chakraborty, Paramita; Duke, Tara F; McGue, Shannon; Jeffcoat, Braxton; Dunne, Jaclyn; Johnson, Logan; Choi, Seungho; Nahhas, Georges J; Gandy, Amy S; Babic, Nikolina; Nolte, Frederick S; Howe, Philip; Ogretmen, Besim; Gangaraju, Vamsi K; Tomlinson, Stephen; Madden, Brian; Bridges, Tracy; Flume, Patrick A; Wrangle, John; Rubinstein, Mark P; Baliga, Prabhakar K; Nadig, Satish N; Mehrotra, Shikhar",iScience,423,23

Although reported prevalence estimates of certain mental disorders, substance use, or substance use disorders are not generally higher among racial and ethnic minority groups, persons in these groups are often less likely to receive treatment services (1). Persistent systemic social inequities and discrimination related to living conditions and work environments, which contribute to disparities in underlying medical conditions, can further compound health problems faced by members of racial and ethnic minority groups during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and worsen stress and associated mental health concerns (2,3). In April and May 2020, opt-in Internet panel surveys of English-speaking U.S. adults aged &#8805;18 years were conducted to assess the prevalence of self-reported mental health conditions and initiation of or increases in substance use to cope with stress, psychosocial stressors, and social determinants of health.

As of April 3, 2020, more than 1,000,000 human infections have been diagnosed around the world, which exhibited apparent person-to-person transmission characteristics of this virus. The capacity of vertical transmission in SARS-CoV-2 remains controversial recently. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is now confirmed as the receptor of SARS-CoV-2 and plays essential roles in human infection and transmission. In present study, we collected the online available single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to evaluate the cell specific expression of ACE2 in maternal-fetal interface as well as in multiple fetal organs. Our results revealed that ACE2 was highly expressed in maternal-fetal interface cells including stromal cells and perivascular cells of decidua, and cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast in placenta. Meanwhile, ACE2 was also expressed in specific cell types of human fetal heart, liver and lung, but not in kidney. And in a study containing series fetal and post-natal mouse lung, we observed ACE2 was dynamically changed over the time, and ACE2 was extremely high in neonatal mice at post-natal day 1~3. In summary, this study revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 receptor was widely spread in specific cell types of maternal-fetal interface and fetal organs. And thus, both the vertical transmission and the placenta dysfunction/abortion caused by SARS-CoV-2 need to be further carefully investigated in clinical practice.","Li, Mengmeng; Chen, Liang; Zhang, Jingxiao; Xiong, Chenglong; Li, Xiangjie",PLoS One,423,19

In this single-centre retrospective registry, all consecutive patients receiving V-V ECMO between 1 March 2020 to 1 May 2021 were included and analysed. The patient cohort was divided into two groups: those who remained on V-V ECMO and those who required conversion to other modalities. Seventy-eight patients were included, with fourteen cases (18%) requiring conversions to veno-arterial (V-A) or hybrid ECMO. The reasons for the ECMO mode configuration change were inadequate drainage (35.7%), inadequate perfusion (14.3%), myocardial infarction (7.1%), hypovolemic shock (14.3%), cardiogenic shock (14.3%) and septic shock (7.1%). In multivariable analysis, the use of dobutamine (p = 0.007) and a shorter ICU duration (p = 0.047) predicted the conversion. The 30-day mortality was higher in converted patients (log-rank p = 0.029). Overall, only 19 patients (24.4%) survived to discharge or lung transplantation. Adverse events were more common after conversion and included renal, cardiovascular and ECMO-circuit complications. Conversion itself was not associated with mortality in the multivariable analysis.

Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs), highly regarded for their regenerative capacities, also possessesremarkable immunoregulatory functions affecting all types of innate and adaptive immune cells. Owing to that, MSCs have been heavily investigated in clinic for the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases along with transplant rejection. Extensive research in the last decaderevealed that MSCs carry out most of their functions through paracrine factors which are soluble mediators and extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs, including exosomes and microvesicles, are an efficient way of intercellular communication due to their unique ability to carry biological messages such as transcription factors, growth factors, cytokines, mRNAs and miRNAs over long distances. EVs originate through direct budding of the cell membrane or the endosomal secretion pathway and they consist of the cytosolic and membrane components of their parent cell. Therefore, they are able to mimic the characteristics of the parent cell, affecting the target cells upon binding or internalization. EVs secreted by MSCs are emerging as a cell-free alternative to MSC-based therapies. MSC EVs are being tested in preclinical and clinical settings where they exhibit exceptional immunosuppressivecapacity. They regulate the migration, proliferation, activation and polarization of various immune cells, promoting a tolerogenic immune response while inhibiting inflammatory response. Being as effective immunomodulators as their parent cells, MSC EVs are also preferable over MSC-based therapies due to their lower risk of immunogenicity, tumorigenicity and overall superior safety. In this review, we present the outcomes of preclinical and clinical studies utilizing MSC EVs as therapeutic agents for the treatment of a wide variety of immunological disorders.","Bulut, Özlem; Gürsel, İhsan",Turk.

This qualitative study sought to understand how this dramatic change in delivery has affected mental health care, including modes of telemedicine psychiatrists used, barriers encountered, and future plans. The aim was to inform the ongoing COVID-19 response and pass on lessons learned to psychiatrists who are starting to offer telemedicine. METHODS: From March 31 to April 9, 2020, semistructured interviews were conducted with 20 outpatient psychiatrists practicing in five U.S. states with significant early COVID-19 activity. Inductive and deductive approaches were used to develop interview summaries, and a matrix analysis was conducted to identify and refine themes. RESULTS: At the time of the interviews, all 20 psychiatrists had been using telemedicine for 2-4 weeks. Telemedicine encompassed video visits, phone visits, or both. Although many continued to prefer in-person care and planned to return to it after the pandemic, psychiatrists largely perceived the transition positively. However, several noted challenges affecting the quality of provider-patient interactions, such as decreased clinical data for assessment, diminished patient privacy, and increased distractions in the patient's home setting. Several psychiatrists noted that their disadvantaged patients lacked reliable access to a smartphone, computer, or the Internet. Participants identified several strategies that helped them improve telemedicine visit quality. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has driven a dramatic shift in how psychiatrists deliver care. Findings highlight that although psychiatrists expressed some concerns about the quality of these encounters, the transition has been largely positive for both patients and physicians.","Uscher-Pines, Lori; Sousa, Jessica; Raja, Pushpa; Mehrotra, Ateev; Barnett, Michael L; Huskamp, Haiden A",Psychiatr Serv,423,32

While POS caused alarm and reduced tolerance to therapy, this phenomenon resolved over a median of 17 days with improvement of parenchymal disease. The mechanisms of POS are likely due to gravitational redistribution of pulmonary blood flow resulting in increased basal physiological shunting and upper zone dead space ventilation due to the predominantly basal distribution of consolidative change and reported vasculoplegia and microthrombi in severe COVID-19 disease.","Tan, Geak Poh; Ho, Sharlene; Fan, Bingwen Eugene; Chotirmall, Sanjay H; Tan, Cher Heng; Lew, Sennen Jin Wen; Chia, Po Ying; Young, Barnaby E; Abisheganaden, John Arputhan; Puah, Ser Hon",Respir Physiol Neurobiol,423,16

The main object of this systematic review was to assess the relationship between the ABO blood group and the occurrence and severity of COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic literature search using appropriate MeSH terms was performed through Medline and PubMed. The outcomes considered were the prevalence of the blood group O vs non-O types in SARS-CoV-2 infected and non-infected subjects, and the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection according to ABO group. The methodological quality of the studies included in the analysis was assessed with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, and the overall quality of the available evidence using the GRADE system. Benchmarks used to evaluate the effect size were odd ratios (ORs) for case control studies and risk ratios (RRs) for cohort studies. RESULTS: Twenty-one studies were included in the analysis. Overall, individuals with group O had a lower infection rate compared to individuals of non-O group (OR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.75, 0.86). However, the difference in the effect size was significantly lower in cohort studies compared to case control studies. No evidence was found indicating an effect of the O type on the disease severity in the infected patients. DISCUSSION: We have found low/very low evidence that group O individuals are less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to those in the non-O group. No evidence was found indicating an effect of the O type on disease severity in SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Franchini, Massimo; Cruciani, Mario; Mengoli, Carlo; Marano, Giuseppe; Candura, Fabio; Lopez, Nadia; Pati, Ilaria; Pupella, Simonetta; De Angelis, Vincenzo","Blood transfus.

However, few studies have examined whether Saharan dust intrusions influence the incidence and severity of COVID-19 cases. To address this question, in this study we carried out generalized linear models with Poisson link between incidence rates and daily hospital admissions and average daily concentrations of PM10, NO2, and O3 in nine Spanish regions for the period from February 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020. The models were adjusted by maximum daily temperature and average daily absolute humidity. Furthermore, we controlled for trend, seasonality, and the autoregressive nature of the series. The variable relating to Saharan dust intrusions was introduced using a dichotomous variable, NAF, averaged across daily lags in ranges of 0-7 days, 8-14 days, 14-21 days, and 22-28 days. The results obtained in this study suggest that chemical air pollutants, and especially NO2, are related to the incidence and severity of COVID-19 in Spain. Furthermore, Saharan dust intrusions have an additional effect beyond what is attributable to the variation in air pollution; they are related, in different lags, to both the incidence and hospital admissions rates for COVID-19. These results serve to support public health measures that minimize population exposure on days with particulate matter advection from the Sahara.","Linares, Cristina; Culqui, Dante; Belda, Fernando; López-Bueno, José Antonio; Luna, Yolanda; Sánchez-Martínez, Gerardo; Hervella, Beatriz; Díaz, Julio",Environ. sci. pollut. res. int.

One complexity that warrants consideration is the male-specific impacts of the pandemic within adolescence. METHODS: A review of the relevant literature. RESULTS: Matters of social distancing, virtual education, and substance use may impact adolescent men in fashions that raise their suicide risk more significantly relative to adolescent women. Social distancing may impact adolescents' friendships and generate a regression back to the nuclear family; qualities of male adolescents' friendships and of masculinity suggest that these impacts may be more severe in adolescent men and may directly raise suicide risk. Virtual schooling yields educational and social setbacks; losses of team sports, male mentors, and the implications of diminished educational advancement may more adversely affect adolescent men and raise risk. Substance use has increased in the pandemic, particularly amongst adolescent men. There are direct associations with suicide risk as well as indirectly through increased parental conflict and punishment. CONCLUSION: As adolescent men die by suicide at significantly elevated rates relative to adolescent women, a male-specific consideration of these impacts is indicated to address adolescent suicide in our current era.

Many people are in psychological and existential despair for the loss of their jobs and the isolation that they are experiencing. However, in the midst of this undesirable condition, the natural tendency of the human person to socialize is still present. Done in the spirit of fraternal charity, an individual's way of socialization gives hope to those who are in despair.

We aim to model the impact of PCR testing into resuming endoscopy practice. Methods We performed a retrospective review of endoscopy utilization during the COVID-19 pandemic for a baseline reference. A computer model compared 3 approaches―Strategy 1: endoscopy for urgent indications only; Strategy 2: testing for semi-urgent indications; and Strategy 3: testing all patients. Analysis was made under current COVID-19 prevalence, and projected prevalence of 5% and 10%. Primary outcomes were number of procedures performed/cancelled. Secondary outcomes were direct costs, reimbursement, personal protective equipment used and personnel infected. Disease prevalence, testing accuracy, and costs were obtained from literature. Results During the COVID-19 pandemic, endoscopy volume was 12.7% of expected. Strategy 2 and 3 were safe and effective interventions to resume endoscopy in semi-urgent and elective cases. Investing 22USD and 105USD in testing per patient allowed completing 19.4% and 95.3% of baseline endoscopies respectively. False negative results were seen after testing 4,700 patients (or 3 months applying Strategy 2 in our practice). Implementing PCR testing over 1 week in United States would require 13 and 64 million USD, with a return of 165 and 767 million USD to providers, leaving 65 and 325 health care workers infected. Conclusion PCR testing is an effective strategy to restart endoscopic practice in United States. PCR screening should be implemented during the second phase of the pandemic, once the healthcare system is able to test and isolate all suspected COVID-19 cases.","Corral, Juan E.; Hoogenboom, Sanne A.; Kröner, Paul T.; Vazquez-Roque, Maria I.; Picco, Michael F.; Farraye, Francis A.; Wallace, Michael B.",Gastrointest Endosc,423,11

The aim of this study is to understand the effects of COVID-19 on changing consumers’ eating habits, including their concerns about food service nutrition in case of new disease risk factors. The survey conducted using the computer-assisted web-based interviewing method on a group of 1021 adult respondents in Poland. We collected information about consumer choices and habits related to use of food services during the pandemic. This research found that COVID-19 had an impact on consumers’ use of food services, both on-site and take-away. Using cluster analysis, we identified five main groups of food service consumers. It was found that almost half of the respondent group did not change their diet during the pandemic, 20% of respondents changed their diet to a positive one, and 20% to a diet that was negative. For respondents the most important forms of protection against COVID-19 in catering establishments were hand disinfection (70.3%), table disinfection (70.4%), wearing of masks and visors by staff (68.2%), and the possibility of cashless payments (64.6%). Based on cluster analysis (eight consumer clusters), we stated that majority of respondents did not see any threats to using catering service during the pandemic. Only a small group (8.1%) of respondents were afraid of the possibility of getting sick with COVID-19. This study presented the effects of COVID-19 on consumer eating behavior in catering and their concerns with food services uses. Discovering consumer concerns can reduce risk, increase food safety and improve eating habits.","Czarniecka-Skubina, Ewa; Pielak, Marlena; Sałek, Piotr; Głuchowski, Artur; Kobus-Cisowska, Joanna; Owczarek, Tomasz",Nutrients,423,26

The non-HCWs had a higher mean C-reactive protein, lower oxygen saturation, and a higher incidence of intubation and death. Secondary household transmission developed in three of the non-HCWs’ families. One month after discharge, non-HCWs had more signs of fibrosis on high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan and an impaired pulmonary function test. Although most of the PPE do not confer absolute protection against SARS, it seems that they may lower exposure to the virus, leading to a lower risk of secondary transmission, and be associated with relatively mild disease and a better early outcome.","Lu, Yen-Ta; Chen, Pei-Jan; Sheu, Chin-Yin; Liu, Ching-Lung",J Emerg Med,423,20

Leadership in digital health services is a term that has been used in the literature with various meanings. Conceptualization of leadership in digital health services is needed to deliver higher quality digital health services, update existing leadership practices, and advance research. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to outline a concept analysis that aims to clarify and define the concept of leadership in digital health services. METHODS: The concept analysis will be performed using the Walker and Avant model, which involves eight steps: concept selection, determination of aims, identification of uses, determination of defining attributes, construction of a model case, construction of additional cases, identification of antecedents and consequences, and definition of empirical referents. A scoping literature search will be performed following the search protocol for scoping reviews by the Joanna Briggs Institute to identify all relevant literature on leadership in digital health services. Searches will be conducted in 6 scientific databases (CINAHL, MEDLINE, Scopus, ProQuest, Web of Science, and the Finnish database Medic), and unpublished studies and gray literature will be searched using Google Scholar, EBSCO Open Dissertations, and MedNar. RESULTS: An initial limited search of MEDLINE was undertaken on October 19, 2020, resulting in 883 records. The results of the concept analysis will be submitted for publication by July 2021. CONCLUSIONS: A robust conceptualization of leadership in digital health services is needed to support research, leadership, and education. The concept analysis model of Walker and Avant will be used to meet this need. As leadership in digital health services appears to be an interprofessional and intersectoral collaboration, defining this concept may also facilitate collaboration between professionals and sectors. The concept analysis to be conducted will also expand our understanding of leadership in digital health services.

This creates the need to validate unverified collection devices from manufacturers that may not be a registered supplier for medical devices. As clinical laboratories do not routinely perform quality control of established collection devices, there is a need to have a systematic, robust approach to the assessment of substitute unregistered collection swabs and viral transport media (VTM). A discussion of the aspects requiring consideration when determining the suitability and implementation of new collection devices is presented. These specific assessment criteria include an inspection of device integrity, determination of swab and VTM sterility and in vitro performance, VTM stability, and examination of the clinical performance of the device. This method was used in a front-line medical microbiology laboratory on swabs and VTM from an unregistered manufacturer, with suboptimal results that precluded implementation.

They are at increased risk of hospitalization and mortality. We outline how remote-only management strategies, which leverage transmitted health-related data, can be used to optimize care for HF patients with a CIED during the COVID-19 pandemic. CASE SUMMARY: An 82-year-old man with HF, stable on medical therapy, underwent cardiac resynchronization therapy implantation in 2016. Modern CIEDs facilitate remote monitoring by providing real-time physiological data (thoracic impedance, heart rate and rhythm, etc.). The ‘Triage Heart Failure Risk Score’ (Triage-HFRS), available on Medtronic CIEDs, integrates several monitored physiological parameters into a risk prediction model classifying patients as low, medium, or high risk of HF events within 30 days. In November 2019, the patient was enrolled in an innovative clinical pathway (Triage-HF Plus) whereby any ‘high’ Triage-HF risk status transmission prompts a phone call-based virtual consultation. A high-risk alert was received via remote transmission on 11 March, triggering a phone call assessment. Upon reporting increasing breathlessness, diuretics were initiated. The prescription was remotely issued and delivered to the patient’s home. This approach circumvented the need for all face-to-face reviews, delivering care in an entirely remote manner. DISCUSSION: The challenges posed by COVID-19 have prompted us to think differently about how we deliver care for patients, both now and following the pandemic. Contemporary CIEDs facilitate the ability to remotely monitor HF patients by providing rich physiological data that can help identify individuals at elevated risk of decompensation using automated device-generated alerts.","Ahmed, Fozia Zahir; Crosbie, Carol; Kahn, Matthew; Motwani, Manish",Eur Heart J Case Rep,423,26

METHODS: Patients with unexplained fever and thrombocytopenia were enrolled. Viruses were detected using real-time PCR, and bacteria were measured by culturing methods. Serum cytokines, platelet antibody IgG (PA-IgG) and Helicobacter pylori (HP) were detected using ELISA. RESULTS: Pathogens were detected in 74.68% of patients, which included single fungal/viral/bacterial infection and multiple infection. The pathogens could not be unidentified in 25.32% of cases. Cytokines including Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, interferon-γ(IFN-γ), platelet activating factor (PAF) and PA-IgG were significantly higher in patients as compared to healthy controls (P < .01 or P < .05). Principal component analyses extracted four groups of parameters that have a strong positive predicting value, revealing that disease status evaluation would be more accurate if we combined the platelet parameters and inflammatory biomarkers. While event-free survival (EFS) that indicates the time of platelet elevated after therapy was the highest in patients with single bacterial or fungal infection, EFS was affected by the levels of cytokines and PA-IgG.

The dynamical systems produce chaotic behavior amplified by specific nonlinear feedback mechanisms and irreversible irregularities. The pandemic generated by SARS-CoV-2 virus has determined the extension of the use of telework and the issue of the dichotomy related potential benefits/ disadvantages associated with it. The anomie of the society with multiple dysfunctions is potentiated by the individual anomie induced by anti-pandemic measures. The purpose of this study is to analyze the impact of telework on employee well-being, from the perspective of the theory of social production function, considering seven areas of evaluation, assessed on the basis of specific items. In order to collect the subjectively perceived information, we developed an opinion questionnaire. The information was processed using correlation analysis and regression analysis. We noticed there are some differences in the perception of well-being depending on the workplace and gender. There is a positive relationship between professional development and competences, job satisfaction, work-life balance, organizational climate and well-being, and a negative relationship between the emotional dimension, commitment, autonomy and well-being in the case of the telework © 2021, Amfiteatru Economic.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a potent inducer of vascular permeability, and VEGF plays an integral role in regulating vascular barrier function in physiological conditions and a variety of pathologies, such as cancer, ischemic stroke, cardiovascular disease, retinal conditions, and COVID-19-associated pulmonary edema and sepsis that often leads to acute lung injury, including acute respiratory distress syndrome. However, after initially stimulating permeability, VEGF subsequently mediates angiogenesis to repair damaged tissue following pathological injury. Consequently, understanding the molecular mechanisms of VEGF-induced vascular permeability will facilitate the development of promising therapies that achieve the delicate balance of inhibiting vascular permeability while preserving tissue repair mediated by VEGF signaling. Here, we demonstrate that VEGF signals through signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) to promote vascular permeability. Specifically, we show that STAT3 ablation reduces vascular permeability using endothelial cell-specific STAT3 knockout mice as well as VEGF-inducible zebrafish crossed with CRISPR-Cas9 generated genomic STAT3 knockout zebrafish. Importantly, STAT3 deficiency does not impair vascular development and function in these animals. Wildtype C57BL/6 mice treated with JAK2 inhibitor, AG490, exhibit decreased vascular permeability when measured in vivo by Miles permeability assay, confirming the role of JAK2 in VEGF-induced vascular permeability. Using human endothelial cells, we describe a novel mechanism of STAT3-dependent transcriptional regulation of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), an endothelial transmembrane protein involved in the regulation of vascular permeability. FDA-approved anti-microbial drug, pyrimethamine (PYR), has been identified as an inhibitor of STAT3 function at concentrations known to be safely achieved in humans. We report that PYR substantially reduces VEGF-induced vascular permeability in mice. We confirm that pharmacologically targeting STAT3 increases vascular barrier integrity in human endothelium using two additional STAT3 inhibitor compounds, including atovaquone, an FDA-approved anti-parasitic drug shown to inhibit STAT3-dependent transcription. Taken together, our findings suggest that the VEGF, VEGFR-2, JAK2, and STAT3 signaling cascade regulates vascular barrier integrity and compounds known to inhibit STAT3-dependent activity reduce VEGF-induced vascular permeability in vertebrate models.","Wang, Li; Astone, Matteo; Alam, Sk.

Degradation of iNOS was reduced by a calpain inhibitor, suggesting that PIN1 may affect induction of other calpain-sensitive inflammatory proteins, such as cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, in MAEC. METHODS: MAEC, transduced with lentivirus encoding an inactive control short hairpin (sh) RNA or one targeting PIN1 that reduced PIN1 by 85%, were used. Cells were treated with LPS/IFN, calpain inhibitors (carbobenzoxy-valinyl-phenylalaninal (zVF), PD150606), cycloheximide and COX inhibitors to determine the effect of PIN1 depletion on COX-2 and calpain. RESULTS: LPS or IFN alone did not induce COX-2. However, treatment with 10 μg LPS plus 20 ng IFN per ml induced COX-2 protein 10-fold in Control shRNA MAEC. Induction was significantly greater (47-fold) in PIN1 shRNA cells. COX-2-dependent prostaglandin E2 production increased 3-fold in KD MAEC, but did not increase in Control cells. The additional increase in COX-2 protein due to PIN1 depletion was post-transcriptional, as induction of COX-2 mRNA by LPS/IFN was the same in cells containing or lacking PIN1. Instead, the loss of COX-2 protein, after treatment with cycloheximide to block protein synthesis, was reduced in cells lacking PIN1 in comparison with Control cells, indicating that degradation of the enzyme was reduced. zVF and PD150606 each enhanced the induction of COX-2 by LPS/IFN. zVF also slowed the loss of COX-2 after treatment with cycloheximide, and COX-2 was degraded by exogenous μ-calpain in vitro. In contrast to iNOS, physical interaction between COX-2 and PIN1 was not detected, suggesting that effects of PIN1 on calpain, rather than COX-2 itself, affect COX-2 degradation. While cathepsin activity was unaltered, depletion of PIN1 reduced calpain activity by 55% in comparison with Control shRNA cells. CONCLUSION: PIN1 reduced calpain activity and slowed the degradation of COX-2 in MAEC, an effect recapitulated by an inhibitor of calpain. Given the sensitivity of COX-2 and iNOS to calpain, PIN1 may normally limit induction of these and other calpain substrates by maintaining calpain activity in endothelial cells.","Liu, Tongzheng; Schneider, Ryan A; Shah, Vaibhav; Huang, Yongcheng; Likhotvorik, Rostislav I; Keshvara, Lakhu; Hoyt, Dale G",J Inflamm (Lond),423,5

MethodsUS Census Bureau population estimates for 2019 were used to calculate the percent vaccine ineligible and related measures for counties, states, and the nation as a whole. Vaccination targets for the 30 largest counties by population were calculated. Study measures were calculated for racial/ethnic populations at the national (n=7) and state (n=6) levels. ResultsPercent of population ineligible for vaccine varied widely both geographically and by race/ethnicity. State values ranged from 15.8% in Vermont to 25.7% in Utah, while percent ineligible of the major racial/ethnic groups was 16.4% of non-Hispanic whites, 21.6% of non-Hispanic Blacks, and 27.5% of Hispanics. Achievement of total population vaccine coverage of at least 75% will require vaccinating more than 90% of the population aged 16 years and older in 29 out of 30 of the largest counties in the U.S. ConclusionsThe vaccine-ineligibility of most children for the next 1-2 years, coupled with reported pervasive vaccine hesitancy among adults, especially women and most minorities, means that achievement of adequate levels of vaccine coverage will be very difficult for many vulnerable geographic areas and for several racial/ethnic minority groups, particularly Hispanics, Blacks, and American Indians.","Pathak, E.

Atypical presentations of COVID-19 are being reported in older adults and may pose difficulties for early isolation and treatment, particularly in institutional care settings. We aimed to characterise the presenting symptoms and associated mortality of COVID-19 in older adults, with a focus on care home residents and older adults living in the community. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of consecutive inpatients over 80 years old hospitalised with PCR confirmed COVID-19 between 10th March 2020 and 8th April 2020. Symptoms at presentation, including those associated with frailty, were analysed. Differences between community dwelling and care home residents, and associations with mortality, were assessed using between-group comparisons and logistic regression. Results: Care home residents were less likely to experience cough (46.9% vs 72.9%, p=0.002) but more likely to present with delirium (51.6% vs 31.4%, p=0.018), particularly hypoactive delirium (40.6% vs 24.3%, p=0.043). Mortality was more likely in the very frail (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.00, 1.58, p=0.049) and those presenting with anorexia (OR 3.20, 95% CI 1.21, 10.09, p=0.028). There were no differences in either mortality or length of stay between those admitted from care homes and community dwelling older adults. Conclusion: COVID-19 in those over 80 does not always present with typical symptoms, particularly in those admitted from institutional care.

Objective: To determine whether anti-COVID-19 mRNA-based vaccines administered during lactation illicit an immune response or the transfer of anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies into human milk. Design: Plasma and milk samples were collected from a prospective cohort of lactating individuals who received the mRNA-based vaccines for COVID-19 and from individuals who recovered from COVID-19 infection. Setting: Ambulatory or during postpartum hospitalization. Participants: We report results from lactating participants who received the mRNA-1273 (Moderna, n=9) or the BNT162b2 (Pfizer, n=14) vaccine or recovered from natural SARS-CoV-2 infection (n=3). Interventions and Exposures: Anti-COVID-19 mRNA vaccination (BNT-162b2 and mRNA-1273) or natural SARS-CoV-2 infection. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Plasma and milk samples were collected from lactating individuals before first vaccine dose, on the day of the second dose, and 4 weeks after the second dose. Maternal plasma was evaluated for vaccine-derived IgM and IgG antibodies. Human milk was evaluated by ELISA for vaccine-induced IgA antibodies specific for SARS-CoV-2. Results: Twenty-three lactating individuals were recruited for this study. Levels of IgG and IgM were significantly increased in plasma samples on the day of the second vaccine dose (post vaccine 1), when compared to pre-vaccine samples. In addition, plasma IgG levels 4 weeks after second vaccine dose were significantly higher than plasma IgG levels pre-vaccine or on the day of the second dose. In addition, our results show transfer of anti-SARS-CoV2-Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) IgA antibodies to human milk, 3-4 weeks after each dose of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines (BNT-162b2 and mRNA-1273). The levels of anti-SARS-CoV2-RBD IgA antibody in milk of vaccinated individuals were not significantly different from levels among participants who experienced SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusions and Relevance: Administration of anti-COVID-19 mRNA vaccines during lactation leads to increased anti-SARS-CoV2 IgM and IgG levels in the plasma of lactating mothers and increased anti-SARS-CoV2-RBD IgA levels in human milk. Lactating women who receive the vaccine should continue breastfeeding their infant human milk to allow continuing transfer of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA antibodies to the neonate.

This requires adequate nutritious food with appropriate amounts of macro- and micronutrients. Currently, a well-established system for infant food is enforced by the regulatory bodies, but no clear system exists for complementary food, which is consumed by children from the age of 6 month to 24 months. As the child grows beyond 6 months, the need for nutrients increases, and if the nutritional needs are not fulfilled, it can lead to health problems, such as stunted growth, weak immune system, and cardiovascular diseases. Hence, it is important to have regulatory bodies monitoring complementary food in a similar capacity as is required for infant formula. The objective of this review is to provide an overview of the existing regulatory bodies, such as the Codex Alimentarius, International Standard Organization (ISO), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), etc., and their regulations specifically for infant formula that can be adopted for complementary foods. This study focuses on the development of a hazard analysis and risk-based preventive controls (HARPC)-based food safety plan to ensure safe food processing and prevent any possible outbreaks.","Malik, Sargun; Krishnaswamy, Kiruba; Mustapha, Azlin",Foods,423,20

OBJECTIVE: To discover the utility of nasal dipsticks and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-DNA analysis in differentiating bacterial sinusitis from other causes of chronic cough and identifying pathogens from the nasal cavity. METHOD: We recruited 22 patients under 15 years of age with cough lasting longer than 4 weeks (group 1), 7 controls with allergic rhinitis (group 2), and 10 controls without respiratory symptoms (group 3). Based on symptoms, the results of nasal secretion assays, and nasal endoscopy, a diagnosis of clinical bacterial sinusitis was made. We identified potential pathogens by quantitative PCR of nasal secretions. RESULTS: Group 1A (cough with clinical bacterial sinusitis n = 10): Eight (80%) patients had bacterial sinusitis associated with dominant potential pathogenic bacteria (PPB): Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Group 1B (cough without clinical bacterial sinusitis n = 12): None had dominant PPB. Group 2 (allergic rhinitis n = 7): None had dominant PPB. Group 3 (asymptomatic n = 10): None had dominant PPB. Twenty to 57% of all groups were colonized with Staphylococcus aureus. Fifty to 70% were colonized with Staphylococcus epidermidis, Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum, and Dolosigranulum pigrum. CONCLUSION: In children with chronic cough, clinicians can utilize a simple and inexpensive nasal secretion dipstick assay for rapid diagnosis of sinusitis and identify PPB by DNA-PCR test for specific antibiotic treatment.","Song, Charles; Chorath, Jeena; Pak, Youngju; Redjal, Nasser",Allergy Rhinol (Providence),423,21

The aim of this study was to examine the managerial and clinical challenges of nurse managers in mental health centers during the current COVID‐19 pandemic. DESIGN: A mixed‐methods study based on an analysis of data obtained in focus groups with 25 nurse managers from two mental health centers in Israel. METHODS: The quantitative phase was conducted prior to the group sessions using a structured self‐administered questionnaire that examined the nurse managers’ (a) background data, (b) communication with the staff nurses, (c) perceptions of nurses’ functioning, (d) perceptions of their own functioning, and (e) management as impacted by the pandemic. The qualitative phase included three sessions of focus groups in which the nurse managers discussed both their challenging and positive issues during the pandemic. FINDINGS: The most important challenges were related to the need to protect patients from infection and communicating with families and primary caregivers. Work policies and procedures were less well adapted to pandemic conditions; nevertheless, nurse managers felt a sense of purpose, duty, and pride in their work. Three themes emerged: (a) ""management complexity"" included the change from a familiar routine to a new reality, working in capsules, protecting against infection, functional confusion, and insights into future epidemics; (b) ""challenging communication"" included communication with patients through glass walls and communication with staff through screens and (c) ""bright spots"" referred to staff cohesion and the provision of respectful care. CONCLUSIONS: Mental health nurse managers have experienced during the pandemic a change in their roles from being less managerial to focusing more on clinical work. Communication between nurse managers and staff nurses and between mental health patients and staff were the main challenges. Nurse managers favorably noted the uniformity and humanity of the staff, sense of cohesion, and shared responsibility. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In the first wave of the pandemic, there was confusion as to the functional role of ward nurse managers, as the focus of their activities became more clinical and less managerial. During and after the pandemic, preventive interventions should be carried out in order to assist patients, staff nurses, and nurse managers in mental health centers.","Kagan, Ilya; Shor, Razya; Ben Aharon, Iris; Yerushalmi, Sarit; Kigli‐Shemesh, Ronit; Gelman, Sophi; Itzhaki, Michal",J Nurs Scholarsh,423,1

One of the hit compounds was (Z)-1-((5-fluoro-1H-indol-3-yl)methylene)-6-methyl-4-thioxo-4,5-dihydrofuro[3,4-c]pyridin-3(1H)-one (15a) with half-maximal effective concentrations of 17.4–21.1 μM against influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B viruses without any cellular toxicity at 900 μM. To investigate the structure–activity relationships, two dozens of the hit analogs were synthesized. Among them, 15g, 15j, 15q, 15s, 15t and 15x had anti-influenza viral activity comparable or superior to that of the initial hit. The anti-influenza viral compounds efficiently suppressed not only viral protein level of the infected cells but also production of viral progeny in the culture supernatants in a dose-dependent manner. Based on a mode-of-action study, they did not affect virus entry or RNA replication. Instead, they suppressed viral neuraminidase activity. This study is the first to demonstrate that dihydrofuropyridinones could serve as lead compounds for the discovery of alternative influenza virus inhibitors.","Jang, Ye Jin; Achary, Raghavendra; Lee, Hye Won; Lee, Hyo Jin; Lee, Chong-Kyo; Han, Soo Bong; Jung, Young-Sik; Kang, Nam Sook; Kim, Pilho; Kim, Meehyein",Antiviral Res,423,1

This paper presents findings from a scoping-usability and test performance study of a microfluidic immunofluorescence assay for COVID-19 in care homes. Methods A mixed-methods evaluation was conducted in four UK care homes to scope usability and to assess the agreement with qRT-PCR. A dry run with luminescent dye was carried out to explore biosafety issues. Results The agreement analysis was carried out on 227 asymptomatic participants (159 staff and 68 residents) and 14 symptomatic participants (5 staff and 9 residents). Asymptomatic specimens showed 50% (95% CI: 1.3%-98.7%) positive agreement and 96% (95% CI: 92.5%-98.1%) negative agreement with overall prevalence and bias-adjusted Kappa (PABAK) of 0.911 (95% CI: 0.857-0.965). Symptomatic specimens showed 83.3% (95% CI: 35.9%-99.6%) positive agreement and 100% (95% CI: 63.1%-100%) negative agreement with overall prevalence and bias-adjusted Kappa (PABAK) of 0.857 (95% CI: 0.549-1). The dry run showed four main sources of contamination that led to the modification of the standard operating procedures. Simulation after modification showed no further evidence of contamination. Conclusion Careful consideration of biosafety issues and contextual factors associated with care home are mandatory for safe use the POCT. Whilst POCT may have some utility for ruling out COVID-19, further diagnostic accuracy evaluations are needed to promote effective adoption.","Micocci, M.; Buckle, P.; Hayward, G.; Allen, A.

Excessive inflammation has been postulated to be a major factor in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 and innate immune mechanisms are likely to be central in the inflammatory response. We used 40-plex mass cytometry and targeted serum proteomics to profile innate immune cell populations from peripheral blood of patients with mild or severe COVID-19 and healthy controls. Sampling at different stages of COVID-19 allowed us to reconstruct a pseudo-temporal trajectory of the innate immune response. Despite the expected patient heterogeneity, we identified consistent changes during the course of the infection. A rapid and early surge of CD169+ monocytes associated with an IFNγ+MCP-2+ signature quickly followed symptom onset; at symptom onset, patients with mild and severe COVID-19 had a similar signature, but over the course of the disease, the differences between patients with mild and severe disease increased. Later in the disease course, we observed a more pronounced re-appearance of intermediate/non-classical monocytes and mounting systemic CCL3 and CCL4 levels in patients with severe disease. Our data provide new insights into the dynamic nature of the early inflammatory response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and identifies sustained pathological innate immune responses as a likely key mechanism in severe COVID-19, further supporting investigation of targeted anti-inflammatory interventions in severe COVID-19.","Chevrier, Stéphane; Zurbuchen, Yves; Cervia, Carlo; Adamo, Sarah; Raeber, Miro E.; de Souza, Natalie; Sivapatham, Sujana; Jacobs, Andrea; Bächli, Esther; Rudiger, Alain; Stüssi-Helbling, Melina; Huber, Lars C.; Schaer, Dominik J.; Nilsson, Jakob; Boyman, Onur; Bodenmiller, Bernd",bioRxiv,423,32

We aimed to investigate the host genetic variants associated with COVID-19. Methods: The summary result of a COVID-19 GWAS (9,373 hospitalized COVID-19 cases and 1,197,256 controls) was obtained from the COVID-19 Host Genetic Initiative GWAS meta-analyses. We tested colocalization of the GWAS signals of COVID-19 with expression and methylation quantitative traits loci (eQTL and mQTL, respectively) using the summary data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) analysis. Four eQTL and two mQTL datasets were utilized in the SMR analysis, including CAGE blood eQTL data (n = 2,765), GTEx v7 blood (n = 338) and lung (n = 278) eQTL data, Geuvadis lymphoblastoid cells eQTL data, LBC-BSGS blood mQTL data (n = 1,980), and Hannon blood mQTL summary data (n = 1,175). We conducted a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) on COVID-19 with precomputed prediction models of GTEx v8 eQTL in lung and blood using S-PrediXcan. Results: Our SMR analyses identified seven protein-coding genes (TYK2, IFNAR2, OAS1, OAS3, XCR1, CCR5, and MAPT) associated with COVID-19, including two novel risk genes, CCR5 and tau-encoding MAPT. The TWAS revealed four genes for COVID-19 (CXCR6, CCR5, CCR9, and PIGN), including two novel risk genes, CCR5 and PIGN. Conclusion: Our study highlighted the functional relevance of some known genome-wide risk genes of COVID-19 and revealed novel genes contributing to differential outcomes of COVID-19 disease.","Baranova, Ancha; Cao, Hongbao; Zhang, Fuquan",Front Med (Lausanne),423,18

Since the appearance of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, its application has been increasingly undermined as other subsequent pandemics (H1N1, Ebola, coronavirus disease 2019) seriously infringing lay rescuers intervention during classical CPR steps (mouth-to-mouth ventilation), forcing to modify vital support protocols. Both KI-1 Yong quan and PC-9 Zhong chong alternative rescue maneuvers could come to aid those victims of impending death situation due to both cardiac arrest or stroke, upgrading current survival rates of said unfortunate patients. AIM: To validate a complementary resuscitation maneuver originated in Chinese Medicine knowledge, carefully integrated into international CPR protocols [World Journal of Critical Care Medicine (WJCCM), August 2013]. METHODS: The model to verify its statistical validity of quoted research was the Retrospective Cohort Study, which redeems the “semiotic paradigm” that gave rise to medical semiotics. Its value strives in the differential detail if the deceased patients are considered the control group instead of the patients that may be deceased. Thus, combining the semiotic paradigm with the Retrospective Cohort Study allows us to manage the collateral potential lethal effects of the random process in cases of extreme emergencies. RESULTS: The statistic results provided by the methodological analysis of this work were previously published in WJCCM August 2013, ISSN 2220-3141). In a total of 89 patients in which the Yong quan maneuver was tested, 75 survived and 14 died. In order to compare this data with the percentages of survivors in the other maneuvers, we stipulate the assumption that if 89 patients are the 100% of the sample, how many patients would survive if the survival rate is 6.4% in CPR, 30% in defibrillation and 48% in CPR + defibrillation. By this way we obtained the approximate values of patients that would survive when applying these classical resuscitation maneuvers. Then we obtained the format of the tables to perform the exact Fisher test with the help of a statistical processor; the consequent result in a valuation of P < 0.0001 was considered ""extremely statistically significant"". CONCLUSION: The author herein provides a methodological–statistical analysis of such contribution which does not imply any cost at all and could even help prevent the withdrawal of classical CPR practices.","Inchauspe, Adrian A",World J Crit Care Med,423,1

Prior to our study, several cases of neonatal infection were observed in infants born at our hospital. This prospective pilot monocentric pilot study investigates the possibility of maternofetal transmission of HCoV responsible for cases of neonatal infection observed within the first 24 hours of life. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three samples from mother–child couples, maternal vaginal (VM) and respiratory (RM) samples during labor; newborn gastric sample (GNN), were assessed for viral analysis using real time RT-PCR for the detection of HCoV 229-E and OC43. Clinical follow-up of infants and mothers was up to Day 3 after birth. RESULTS: One hundred (and) fifty-nine mother–child couples were included between July 2003 and August 2005. HCoV 229-E only was detected in 11 samples from 6 mother–child couples. For 2 couples, all 3 samples (VM, RM and GNN) were tested positive (cases 1 and 2). For case 3, both VM and GNN were positive. For 2 couples, only RM was positive (cases 4 and 5). In case 6, only VM was positive. Of the 3 positive GNN, no infant was symptomatic. CONCLUSION: Possible vertical transmission of HCoV was evidenced in this pilot study and requires further investigation on a larger scale. Equally indicated is the inclusion of tests to detect recently identified human coronaviruses HCoV NL63 and HKU1, as well as genomic profile analysis of HCoV 229-E detected in the 3 positive mother-child couples.","Gagneur, A.; Dirson, E.; Audebert, S.; Vallet, S.; Quillien, M.C.L.; Baron, R.; Laurent, Y.; Collet, M.; Sizun, J.; Oger, E.; Payan, C.",Pathol Biol (Paris),423,16

Influenza prevention and containment strategies can be considered under the broad categories of antiviral, vaccine and non-pharmaceutical (case isolation, household quarantine, school or workplace closure, restrictions on travel) measures(1). Mathematical models are powerful tools for exploring this complex landscape of intervention strategies and quantifying the potential costs and benefits of different options(2,3,4,5). Here we use a large-scale epidemic simulation(6) to examine intervention options should initial containment(6,7) of a novel influenza outbreak fail, using Great Britain and the United States as examples. We find that border restrictions and/or internal travel restrictions are unlikely to delay spread by more than 2–3 weeks unless more than 99% effective. School closure during the peak of a pandemic can reduce peak attack rates by up to 40%, but has little impact on overall attack rates, whereas case isolation or household quarantine could have a significant impact, if feasible. Treatment of clinical cases can reduce transmission, but only if antivirals are given within a day of symptoms starting. Given enough drugs for 50% of the population, household-based prophylaxis coupled with reactive school closure could reduce clinical attack rates by 40–50%. More widespread prophylaxis would be even more logistically challenging but might reduce attack rates by over 75%. Vaccine stockpiled in advance of a pandemic could significantly reduce attack rates even if of low efficacy. Estimates of policy effectiveness will change if the characteristics of a future pandemic strain differ substantially from those seen in past pandemics.

A high level of work-related HL could support work ability and in the longer run employability. These topics are becoming increasingly important in current circumstances and in view of ongoing developments (e.g., digitalization and “new” work). A basic understanding and measurement of HL as an individual competence in the context of working life is necessary to develop future interventions to promote HL among people of working age. According to the participants, concept, and context (PCC) framework, we included articles on health literacy (concept) in the target group of people of working age in the workplace (population and context). Key information sources were the databases PubMed, CINAHL, PsycInfo, and PSYNDEX. A total of 30 articles were included. There are several terms for “health literacy in the workplace” (including individual work-related or occupational HL). The conceptualizations of the individual employee’s competence covered all aspects of HL (“access”, “understand”, “appraise”, and “apply” health information). The conceptualizations differed, among others, in the covered time horizon (referring either only to employees’ current work situation or additionally to their employability in the lifespan) or whether they referred also to the viability of the respective company. Published interventions attempting to promote individual work-related HL seem mostly to be targeted at the promotion of mental HL. A variety of outcomes have been measured in intervention studies, while specific measurement instruments for individual work-related HL seem to be scarce. We recommend the development of country-specific instruments for the assessment of individual work-related health literacy and to measure mental and physical work-related health literacy.","Ehmann, Anna T.; Ög, Eylem; Rieger, Monika A.; Siegel, Achim",Int J Environ Res Public Health,423,1

Life insurers have primarily grown through variable annuities, which are mutual funds with longevity insurance, a potential tax advantage, and minimum return guarantees. The minimum return guarantees change the primary function of life insurers from traditional insurance to financial engineering. Variable annuity insurers are exposed to interest and equity risk mismatch and their stock returns were especially low during the COVID-19 crisis. We consider regulatory changes, such as more detailed financial disclosure and standardized stress tests, to monitor potential risk mismatch and to ensure stability of the insurance sector.","Koijen, Ralph S.

However, this measure carried risks for people's mental health. This study evaluated the psychological repercussions of objective isolation in 1,006 Italians during the first, especially strict, lockdown in spring 2020. Although varying for the regional spread-rate of the contagion, results showed that the longer the isolation and the less adequate the physical space where people were isolated, the worse the mental health (e.g., depression). Offline social contacts buffered the association between social isolation and mental health. However, when offline contacts were limited, online contacts seemed crucial in protecting mental health. The findings inform about the potential downsides of the massive social isolation imposed by COVID-19 spread, highlighting possible risk factors and resources to account for implementing such isolation measures. Specifically, besides some known factors such as physical space availability, the local contagion rate is critical in moderating the link between social isolation and mental health issues, supporting national policies implementing regional tiers of restriction severity.","Pancani, Luca; Marinucci, Marco; Aureli, Nicolas; Riva, Paolo",Front Psychol,423,1

Some of these measures can adversely affect mental health. Activities that can be performed at home may mitigate these consequences and improve overall mental well-being. In this study, home-based activities that have potential beneficial effects on mental health were examined. METHODS: A rapid review was conducted based on a search of the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PyscINFO, Global Health, epistemonikos.org, covid19reviews.org, and eppi.ioe.ac.uk/covid19_map_v13.html. Eligible studies include randomized controlled trials and non-randomized studies published between 1/1/2000 and 28/05/2020 and that examined the impact of various activities on mental health outcomes in low-resource settings and contexts that lead to social isolation. Studies of activities that require mental health professionals or that could not be done at home were excluded. Two review authors performed title/abstract screening. At the full-text review stage, 25% of the potentially eligible studies were reviewed in full by two review authors; the rest were reviewed by one review author. Risk of bias assessment and data extraction were performed by one review author and checked by a second review author. The main outcome assessed was change or differences in mental health as expressed in Cohen’s d; analysis was conducted following the synthesis without meta-analysis guidelines (SWiM). PROSPERO registration: CRD42020186082. RESULTS: Of 1,236 unique records identified, 160 were reviewed in full, resulting in 16 included studies. The included studies reported on the beneficial effects of exercise, yoga, progressive muscle relaxation, and listening to relaxing music. One study reported on the association between solitary religious activities and post traumatic stress disorder symptoms. While most of the included studies examined activities in group settings, particularly among individuals in prisons, the activities were described as something that can be performed at home and alone. All included studies were assessed to be at risk of bias in one or more of the bias domains examined. CONCLUSIONS: There is some evidence that certain home-based activities can promote mental wellness during the COVID-19 pandemic. Guidelines are needed to help optimize benefits while minimizing potential risks when performing these activities.","Puyat, Joseph H.; Ahmad, Haroon; Avina-Galindo, Ana Michelle; Kazanjian, Arminee; Gupta, Aanchel; Ellis, Ursula; Ashe, Maureen C.; Vila-Rodriguez, Fidel; Halli, Priyanka; Salmon, Amy; Vigo, Daniel; Almeida, Alberto; De Bono, Christopher E.",PLoS One,423,20

Here, we perform the global stability analysis using two techniques, the Lyapunov direct method and the geometric approach to stability, based on the higher-order generalization of Bendixsonʼs criterion.

Whilst food safety regulations have been introduced over the past few years to maintain the microbial safety of foods sold from these wet markets, it remains unclear whether the hygiene maintenance that is performed on the wooden cutting boards used for meat-processing is effective. In fact, hygiene maintenance may often be overlooked, and hygiene standards may be insufficient. If so, this may lead to the spread of harmful pathogens through cross-contamination, thereby causing severe risks to public health. The aim of this study was to determine the level of microbial transfer between wooden cutting boards and swine meat of various qualities, using 16S metagenomic sequencing, strain identification and biofilm screening of isolated strains. The results established that: (a) the traditional hygiene practices used for cleaning wooden cutting boards in Hong Kong’s wet markets expose the surfaces to potentially harmful microorganisms; (b) the processing of microbially contaminated meat on cutting boards cleaned using traditional practices leads to cross-contamination; and (c) several potentially pathogenic microorganisms found on the cutting boards have good biofilm-forming abilities. These results reinforce the need to review the traditional methods used to clean wooden cutting boards after the processing of raw meat in Hong Kong’ wet markets so as to prevent cross-contamination events. The establishment of proper hygiene protocols may reduce the spread of disease-causing microorganisms (including antibiotic-resistant microorganisms) in food-processing environments.","Sekoai, Patrick T.; Feng, Shiqi; Zhou, Wenwen; Ngan, Wing Y.; Pu, Yang; Yao, Yuan; Pan, Jie; Habimana, Olivier",Microorganisms,423,16

To examine the role of other host factors in MHV infection in mice, IFN-γ-deficient mice with a BALB/c background (BALB-GKO) were infected intraperitoneally with MHV and compared with B6-GKO mice. In contrast to B6-GKO mice, BALB-GKO mice died within 1 week due to acute hepatic failure. The viral titer of the liver in BALB-GKO mice was significantly higher than that in B6-GKO mice. All hepatocytes in BALB-GKO mice were necrotic at 5 days post-infection, which was clearly distinct from large but limited lesion in the liver from infected B6-GKO mice. The serum alanine aminotransferase activity of infected BALB-GKO mice were higher than that of B6-GKO mice and was paralleled with the severity of the pathological changes and viral titers in infected mice. Administration of exogenous IFN-γ to BALB-GKO partially inhibited the acute death.

Due to the growing number of confirmed cases, timely and accurate classification of healthy and infected patients is essential to control and treat COVID-19. To this end, in this paper, we aim to develop a deep learning-based system for the persuasive classification and reliable detection of COVID- 19 using chest radiography. Firstly, we evaluate the performance of various state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) proposed over recent years for medical image classification. Secondly, we develop and train CNN from scratch. In both cases, we use a recently published public X-Ray dataset for training and validation purposes. For transfer learning, we obtain 100% accuracy for binary classification (i.e., Normal/COVID-19) and 87.50% accuracy for tertiary classification (Normal/COVID- 19/Pneumonia). With the CNN trained from scratch, we achieve 93.75% accuracy for tertiary classification. We observe, in the case of transfer learning, the classification accuracy drops with an increased number of classes.

This qualitative study carried out in Italy and Romania in 2020 involved 30 participants: older adults, caregivers, and stakeholders. Based on a user-centered design approach, this study aimed to understand which requirements of ICT/sensing technologies could match people’s needs of active and healthy aging. Findings highlighted that ICT/sensing technology needs to focus on six major themes: (1) learnability, (2) security, (3) independence, empowerment, and coaching values, (4) social isolation, (5) impact of habit, culture, and education variables, and (6) personalized solutions. These themes are consistent with the Active Aging framework and the factors that influence perceived usefulness and potential benefits among older adults. Consequently, this study shows how well-known, but still unresolved, issues affect the field of information and communication technologies (ICTs) to promote active and healthy aging.

METHODS: The factors associated with the use, self-medication practice, and adverse reactions due the consumption of allopathic and complementary medicine to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2 virus were assessed using a structured questionnaire. The suspected adverse reactions associated with the use of drugs or complementary medicine were reported. RESULTS: The prevalence (42.9%) of allopathic and/or complementary medicine use for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection was mainly associated with unemployment [OR:2.026 (1.722–2.283)]. Acetaminophen (n = 2272) and vitamin C (n = 3252) were the main allopathic and complementary medicine products used to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection, respectively.

This makes small states vulnerable and raises the question if specific policies can be implemented to offset the drawbacks of their small size and to increase resilience. We address this question in this paper, thereby focusing on the role of connectivity – between states, organisations, parties, or otherwise – in understanding a country’s vulnerability and resilience. Here ‘policies’ are interpreted as ‘institutions’ in the sense of Douglass C. North (1990), i.e. as ‘humanly devised constraints that structure political, economic and social interaction’. We focus on the Caribbean area, which is characterised by a wide variety of small states, each with its own set of rules and regulations. Within this area, we concentrate on the relationship between three Dutch Caribbean islands, i.e., Aruba, Curaçao, and Sint Maarten, on the one hand, and the Netherlands, the former colonizer, on the other hand. As a first step we have measured the economic vulnerability and resilience of 17 Caribbean island states, both dependent and independent, employing the theoretical framework proposed by Lino Briguglio. The outcomes show that the three Dutch island states are performing comparatively well, although there are individual differences. We provide a first effort to explain this outcome in terms of the continuing interest of the three island states to keep their ties to the former colonizer viable. Here the presence of ‘systemic interest’ as shown by the stakeholders appears to be a most important variable.

This paper describes the design and methods of a cluster randomized trial of H(2)GO!, a youth empowerment intervention to prevent childhood obesity through reducing SSB consumption among a low-income, ethnically diverse sample of youth. METHODS: This cluster randomized controlled trial is an academic-community partnership with the Massachusetts Alliance of Boys and Girls Clubs (BGC). Ten BGC sites will be randomly assigned to the H(2)GO! intervention or a wait-list, usual care control. Eligible study participants will be N = 450 parent-child pairs (youth ages 9–12 years and their parents/caregivers) recruited from participating BGCs. The 6-week in-person H(2)GO! intervention consists of 12 group-based sessions delivered by BGC staff and youth-led activities. An innovative feature of the intervention is the development of youth-produced narratives as a strategy to facilitate youth empowerment and parental engagement. Child outcomes include measured body mass index z scores (zBMI), beverage intake, and youth empowerment. Parent outcomes include beverage intake and availability of SSBs at home. Outcomes will be measured at baseline and at 2, 6, and 12 months. With a 75% retention rate, the study is powered to detect a minimum group difference of 0.1 zBMI units over 12 months.

Patients with chronic disease have always been vulnerable to stressful life conditions. Therefore, determining the perceived stress and coping strategies among chronic disease patients is crucial to minimize the mental health consequences related to the outbreak. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine COVID-19-related stress and coping strategies among adults with chronic disease in southwest Ethiopia. METHODS: An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 613 randomly selected adults with chronic disease in southwest Ethiopia. A multiple linear regression analysis was used to determine the relationship between the COVID-19-related stress score and coping strategy types, and independent sample t-tests and ANOVA tests were conducted. Statistical significance was accepted at p-values <0.05. RESULTS: More than two-thirds of study participants (68.4%) were moderately stressed, 13.9% were severely stressed, and 17.8% had low levels of perceived stress. Active coping (β=1.238, 95% CI: 0.0 to 2.477), denial (β=3.678, 95% CI: 2.44 to 4.915), behavioral disengagement (β=3.669, 95% CI: 2.193 to 5.146), self-blame (β=1.722, 95% CI: 0.146 to 3.297), and religion (β=3.443, 95% CI: 2.028 to 4.858) coping strategies positively predicted the COVID-19-related stress score. Only the acceptance coping strategy (β=−2.710, 95% CI: −3.926 to −1.493) negatively predicted the COVID-19-related stress score. CONCLUSION: Significant numbers of participants suffered from moderate to severe perceived stress levels due to the COVID-19 outbreak.

For the final comparative analysis, a 2 × 3 factorial multivariate analysis of variance was conducted after confirming the validity and reliability of data based on 229 questionnaires collected from healthy respondents who have never been infected with COVID-19. The results showed statistically significant differences between worry about illness, which is a subscale of hypochondriasis, disease phobia, thanatophobia, and intent to continue according to age. Statistically significant differences were also found when considering the type of sport for worry about illness, which is a subscale of hypochondriasis, disease phobia, symptom preoccupation, and intent to continue. Furthermore, interaction effects between the two independent variables, i.e., age and type of sport, were found for disease phobia, a subscale of hypochondriasis, and thanatophobia. In summary, age and type of sport, which are important factors for the COVID-19 infection and symptoms, were found to affect the sport activity patterns. These results proved that COVID-19 may have caused the participants to have different perceptions depending on their characteristics and change their form of continuous participation. These findings will provide useful data for predicting the perception and behavioral patterns of sports participants if diseases like COVID-19 occur in the future.

We observed that gross room personnel desire follow-up and feedback on the specimens they gross or autopsies they perform. Our goal was to create a sustainable educational program for gross room personnel. Our primary focus was to impact team dynamic, morale, and fulfillment. We assessed the need for an educational program through a preprogram survey, which contained 11 subjective statements scored on a scale from 1 to 10 (1—strongly disagree and 10—strongly agree). These statements assessed topics of current follow-up and team dynamic (core statements), perceived effect of current follow-up, and prospective impact of case follow-up. Core statements received relatively low scores (ie, the perception of being “an integral part in making a diagnosis” received only a mean score of 6.7). In response, we established the Gross-to-Scope educational program hosted by pathology trainees and attendings. This program is comprised of monthly one-hour conferences to discuss/review cases and highlight special topics of interest (ie, “What is a radial margin anyway?”). We distributed the same surveys after the first and fourth conferences and found a statistically significant increase in the mean responses to core statements after the first conference (P = .041). The trend is similar after four conferences. Overall our program addresses various needs by providing educational opportunities for gross room personnel, which strengthens morale and recognizes hard work, and by fostering a working relationship between gross room personnel and pathologists.","Imblum, Brittney; Stern, Evan; Fortuna, Danielle",Acad Pathol,423,1

Eukaryotic viruses generally modify the 5′-end of their RNAs to mimic the cellular mRNA structure, thereby facilitating viral replication in host cells. However, the molecular organization and biochemical mechanisms of the viral capping apparatus typically differ from its cellular counterpart, which makes viral capping enzymes attractive targets for drug discovery. Our previous work showed that SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) non-structural protein 14 represents a structurally novel and unique guanine-N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) that is able to functionally complement yeast cellular N7-MTase. In the present study, we developed a yeast-based system for identifying and screening inhibitors against coronavirus N7-MTase using both 96-well and 384-well microtiter plates. The MTase inhibitors previously identified by in vitro biochemical assays were tested, and some, such as sinefungin, effectively suppressed N7-MTase in the yeast system. However, other compounds, such as ATA and AdoHcy, did not exert an inhibitory effect within a cellular context. These results validated the yeast assay system for inhibitor screening yet also demonstrated the difference between cell-based and in vitro biochemical assays. The yeast system was applied to the screening of 3000 natural product extracts, and three were observed to more potently inhibit the activity of coronavirus than human N7-MTase.","Sun, Ying; Wang, Zidao; Tao, Jiali; Wang, Yi; Wu, Andong; Yang, Ziwen; Wang, Kaimei; Shi, Liqiao; Chen, Yu; Guo, Deyin",Antiviral Res,423,30

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate if ACEI/ARB use is associated with the risk of mortality and severe disease in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We searched all available clinical studies that included patients with confirmed COVID-19 who could be classified into an ACEI/ARB group and a non-ACEI/ARB group up until 4 May 2020. A meta-analysis was performed, and primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and severe disease. RESULTS: ACEI/ARB use did not increase the risk of all-cause mortality both in meta-analysis for 11 studies with 12 601 patients reporting ORs (OR=0.52 (95% CI=0.37 to 0.72), moderate certainty of evidence) and in 2 studies with 8577 patients presenting HRs.

The purpose of this case report is to describe a novel approach to implementing early mobility interventions for a patient who was pregnant and receiving ECMO while continuing necessary infectious disease precautions because of diagnosed coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). METHODS (CASE DESCRIPTION): A 27-year old woman who was pregnant was admitted to the ICU with COVID-19 and rapidly developed acute respiratory failure requiring 9 days of ECMO support. After a physical therapist consultation, the patient was standing at the bedside by hospital day 5 and ambulating by hospital day 9. RESULTS: The patient safely participated in physical therapy during ICU admission and was discharged to home with outpatient physical therapy follow-up after 14 days of hospitalization. CONCLUSION: Early mobility is feasible during ECMO with COVID-19, and active participation in physical therapy, including in-room ambulation, may facilitate discharge to home. Innovative strategies to facilitate routine activity in a patient who is critically ill with COVID-19 require an established and highly trained team with a focus on maintaining function. IMPACT: Early mobility while intubated, on ECMO, and infected with COVID-19 is feasible while adhering to infectious disease precautions when it is performed by an experienced interdisciplinary team.","Mark, Alex; Crumley, Jennifer P; Rudolph, Kristina L; Doerschug, Kevin; Krupp, Anna",Phys Ther,423,16

METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the extent of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in schools. We performed risk of bias evaluation of all included studies using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). RESULTS: 2178 articles were retrieved and 11 studies were included. Five cohort studies reported a combined 22 student and 21 staff index cases that exposed 3345 contacts with 18 transmissions (overall infection attack rate (IAR): 0.08%, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.00%-0.86%). IARs for students and school staff were 0.15% (95% CI = 0.00%-0.93%) and 0.70% (95% CI = 0.00%-3.56%) respectively. Six cross-sectional studies reported 639 SARS-CoV-2 positive cases in 6682 study participants tested [overall SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate: 8.00% (95% CI = 2.17%-16.95%).

Overall, study quality was judged to be poor with risk of performance and attrition bias, limiting the confidence in the results. CONCLUSIONS: There is limited high-quality evidence available to quantify the extent of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in schools or to compare it to community transmission. Emerging evidence suggests lower IAR and SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate in students compared to school staff. Future prospective and adequately controlled cohort studies are necessary to confirm this finding.","Xu, Wei; Li, Xue; Dozier, Marshall; He, Yazhou; Kirolos, Amir; Lang, Zhongyu; Mathews, Catherine; Siegfried, Nandi; Theodoratou, Evropi",Journal of global health,423,16

Here, we examine saliva and nasopharyngeal (NP) viral load over time and correlate them with patient demographics, and cellular and immune profiling. We found that saliva viral load was significantly higher in those with COVID-19 risk factors; that it correlated with increasing levels of disease severity and showed a superior ability over nasopharyngeal viral load as a predictor of mortality over time (AUC=0.90). A comprehensive analysis of immune factors and cell subsets revealed strong predictors of high and low saliva viral load, which were associated with increased disease severity or better overall outcomes, respectively. Saliva viral load was positively associated with many known COVID-19 inflammatory markers such as IL-6, IL-18, IL-10, and CXCL10, as well as type 1 immune response cytokines. Higher saliva viral loads strongly correlated with the progressive depletion of platelets, lymphocytes, and effector T cell subsets including circulating follicular CD4 T cells (cTfh). Anti-spike (S) and anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG levels were negatively correlated with saliva viral load showing a strong temporal association that could help distinguish severity and mortality in COVID-19. Finally, patients with fatal COVID-19 exhibited higher viral loads, which correlated with the depletion of cTfh cells, and lower production of anti-RBD and anti-S IgG levels. Together these results demonstrated that viral load – as measured by saliva but not nasopharyngeal — is a dynamic unifying correlate of disease presentation, severity, and mortality over time.","Silva, Julio; Lucas, Carolina; Sundaram, Maria; Israelow, Benjamin; Wong, Patrick; Klein, Jon; Tokuyama, Maria; Lu, Peiwen; Venkataraman, Arvind; Liu, Feimei; Mao, Tianyang; Oh, Ji Eun; Park, Annsea; Casanovas-Massana, Arnau; Vogels, Chantal B.

Dalcetrapib exerts its lipid-modulating effect by binding covalently to cysteine 13 of a cholesteryl ester transfer protein. Because 12 free cysteine residues are present in the 3CL protease, we investigated the potential of dalcetrapib to inhibit 3CL protease activity and SARS-CoV-2 replication. Molecular docking investigations suggested that dalcetrapib-thiol binds to the catalytic site of the 3CL protease with a delta G value of −8.5 kcal/mol. Dalcetrapib inhibited both 3CL protease activity in vitro and viral replication in Vero E6 cells with IC(50) values of 14.4 ± 3.3 μM and an EC(50) of 17.5 ± 3.5 μM (mean ± SD). Near-complete inhibition of protease activity persisted despite 1000-fold dilution after ultrafiltration with a nominal dalcetrapib-thiol concentration of approximately 100 times below the IC(50) of 14.4 μM, suggesting stable protease–drug interaction.

In this sense, identifying specificities of each location is essential to minimize the damage caused by the disease. Therefore, the aim of this research was to assess the vulnerability of 853 municipalities in the second most populous state in Brazil, Minas Gerais (MG), in order to direct public policies. An epidemiological study was carried out based on Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) using indicators with some relation to the process of illness and death caused by COVID-19. The indicators were selected by a literature search and categorized into: demographic, social, economic, health infrastructure, population at risk and epidemiological. The variables were collected in Brazilian government databases at the municipal level and evaluated according to MCDA, through the Program to Support Decision Making based on Indicators (PRADIN). Based on this approach, the study performed simulations by category of indicators and a general simulation that allowed to divide the municipalities into groups of 1–5, with 1 being the least vulnerable and 5 being the most vulnerable. The groupings of municipalities were exposed in their respective mesoregions of MG in a thematic map, using the software Tabwin 32. The results revealed that the mesoregion of Norte de Minas stands out with more than 40% of its municipalities belonging to group 5, according to economic, social and health infrastructure indicators. Similarly, the Jequitinhonha mesoregion exhibited almost 60% of the municipalities in this group for economic and health infrastructure indicators. For demographic and epidemiological criteria, the Metropolitana de Belo Horizonte was the most vulnerable mesoregion, with 42.9 and 26.7% of the municipalities in group 5, respectively. Considering the presence of a population at risk, Zona da Mata reported 42.3% of the municipalities in the most vulnerable group.

We consider five regions (Lombardy, Veneto, Emilia-Romagna, Umbria, Apulia) which are located in the north, centre and south of Italy. These five regions differ both in their healthcare systems and in the extent to which they were hit by the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic. We investigate their different responses to COVID-19 reflecting on seven management factors: (1) monitoring, (2) learning, (3) decision-making, (4) coordinating, (5) communicating, (6) leading, and (7) recovering capacity. In light of these factors, we discuss the analogies and differences among the regions and their different institutional choices.","Bosa, Iris; Castelli, Adriana; Castelli, Michele; Ciani, Oriani; Compagni, Amelia; Galizzi, Matteo M.; Garofano, Matteo; Ghislandi, Simone; Giannoni, Margherita; Marini, Giorgia; Vainieri, Milena",Health Policy,423,16

This displacement of medical students from wards has limited experiential learning. Concurrently, outpatient practices are experiencing reduced volumes of in-person visits and are shifting towards virtual healthcare, a transition that comes with its own logistical challenges. This article describes a workflow that enabled medical students to engage in meaningful clinical education while helping an institution’s outpatient practices implement remote telemedicine visits. METHODS: A 4-week virtual elective was designed to allow clinical learners to participate in virtual telemedicine patient encounters. Students were prepared with EMR training and introduced to a novel workflow that supported healthcare providers in the outpatient setting. Patients were consented to telehealth services before encounters with medical students. All collected clinical information was documented in the EMR, after which students transitioned patients to a virtual Doxy.me video appointment. Surveys were used to evaluate clinical and educational outcomes of students’ participation. Elective evaluations and student reflections were also collected. RESULTS: Survey results showed students felt well-prepared to initiate patient encounters. They expressed comfort while engaging with patients virtually during telemedicine appointments. Students identified clinical educational value, citing opportunities to develop patient management plans consistent with in-person experiences. A significant healthcare burden was also alleviated by student involvement. Over 1000 total scheduled appointments were serviced by students who transitioned more than 80 % of patients into virtual attending provider waiting rooms. CONCLUSIONS: After piloting this elective with fourth-year students, pre-clerkship students were also recruited to act in a role normally associated with clinical learners (e.g., elicit patient histories, conduct a review of systems, etc.). Furthermore, additional telemedicine electives are being designed so medical students can contribute to patient care without risk of exposure to COVID-19. These efforts will allow students to continue with their clinical education during the pandemic. Medical educators can adopt a similar workflow to suit evolving remote learning needs.","Weber, Alec M.; Dua, Anoushka; Chang, Kitae; Jupalli, Hamsitha; Rizwan, Farsha; Chouthai, Abhishek; Chen, Catherine",BMC Med Educ,423,27

Little is known about the extent and quality of their antiviral humoral response. Here, we analyzed antibody functions in 52 asymptomatic infected individuals, 119 mild and 21 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. We measured anti- Spike antibody levels with the S-Flow assay and mapped SARS-CoV-2 Spike- and N-targeted regions by Luminex. Neutralization, complement deposition and Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC) were evaluated using replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 or reporter cell systems. We show that COVID-19 sera mediate complement deposition and kill infected cells by ADCC. Sera from asymptomatic individuals neutralize the virus, activate ADCC and trigger complement deposition. Antibody levels and activities are slightly lower in asymptomatic individuals. The different functions of the antibodies are correlated, independently of disease severity. Longitudinal samplings show that antibody functions follow similar kinetics of induction and contraction, with minor variations. Overall, asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection elicits polyfunctional antibodies neutralizing the virus and targeting infected cells. - Sera from convalescent COVID-19 patients activate the complement and kill infected cells by ADCC. - Asymptomatic and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals harbor polyfunctional antibodies. - Antibody levels and functions are slightly lower in asymptomatic individuals - The different antiviral activities of anti-Spike antibodies are correlated regardless of disease severity. - Functions of anti-Spike antibodies have similar kinetics of induction and contraction.","Dufloo, J.; Grzelak, L.; Staropoli, I.; Madec, Y.; Tondeur, L.; Anna, F.; Pelleau, S.; Wiedemann, A.; Planchais, C.; Buchrieser, J.; Robinot, R.; Ungeheuer, M.-N.; Mouquet, H.; Charneau, P.; White, M.; Levy, Y.; Hoen, B.; Fontanet, A.; Schwartz, O.; Bruel, T.",,423,24

The study thus aimed at quantifying and mapping the scientific output of EVD research published within 2010-2020 though a bibliometric perspective. METHODS: EVD-related publications from 2010 to 2020 were retrieved from the Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus databases by using the keywords ‘Ebola', ‘Ebola Virus Disease', ‘Ebolas', and ‘ebolavirus'. Biblioshiny software (using R-studio cloud) was used to categorise and evaluate authors', countries' and journals' contribution. VOSviewer was used for network visualisation. RESULTS: According to the used search strategy, a total of 3865 and 3848 EVD documents were published in WoS and Scopus, respectively. The average citation per document was 16.1 (WoS) and 16.3 (Scopus). The results show an overall increase in the publication trend within the study period. The leading countries in EVD research were the USA and UK, with over 100 papers in both databases, including Nigeria and South Africa. NIAID and CDC-USA were the most influential institutions, while “Infectious Diseases” and “Medicine” were the most decisive research fields. The most contributing authors included Feldmann H and Qiu XG with over 60 papers in each database, while Journal of Infectious Diseases was the most crucial journal. The most cited article was from Aylward et al. published in 2014, while recent years displayed a keyword focus on “double-blind”, “efficacy”, “ring vaccination” and “drug effect”. CONCLUSION: This bibliometric analysis provides an updated historical perspective of progress in EVD research and has highlighted the role played by various stakeholders. However, the contribution of African countries and institutions is not sufficiently reflected, implying a need for increased funding and focus on EVD research for effective prevention and control.","Kawuki, Joseph; Yu, Xiaojin; Musa, Taha Hussein",Biomed Res Int,423,26

SHIRI will describe the frequency of influenza virus infections among HCP, identify predictors of vaccine acceptance, examine how repeated influenza vaccination may modify immunogenicity, and evaluate influenza vaccine effectiveness in preventing influenza illness and missed work. METHODS: Cohort enrollment began in October, 2016; a second year of the study and a second wave of cohort enrollment began in June 2017. The study will run for at least 3 years and will follow approximately 2000 HCP (who are both employees and members of Clalit Health Services [CHS]) with routine direct patient contact. Eligible HCP are recruited using a stratified sampling strategy. After informed consent, participants complete a brief enrollment survey with questions about occupational responsibilities and knowledge, attitudes, and practices about influenza vaccines. Blood samples are collected at enrollment and at the end of influenza season; HCP who choose to be vaccinated contribute additional blood one month after vaccination. During the influenza season, participants receive twice-weekly short message service (SMS) messages asking them if they have acute respiratory illness or febrile illness (ARFI) symptoms. Ill participants receive follow-up SMS messages to confirm illness symptoms and duration and are asked to self-collect a nasal swab. Information on socio-economic characteristics, current and past medical conditions, medical care utilization and vaccination history is extracted from the CHS database. Information about missed work due to illness is obtained by self-report and from employee records. Respiratory specimens from self-collected nasal swabs are tested for influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, and coronaviruses using validated multiplex quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assays. The hemagglutination inhibition assay will be used to detect the presence of neutralizing influenza antibodies in serum. DISCUSSION: SHIRI will expand our knowledge of the burden of respiratory viral infections among HCP and the effectiveness of current and repeated annual influenza vaccination in preventing influenza illness, medical utilization, and missed workdays among HCP who are in direct contact with patients.

We conducted a retrospective cohort study to estimate risk of acquiring symptomatic SARS‐CoV‐2 on aircraft, to inform contact tracing and infection control efforts. METHODS: We identified co‐passengers of infectious passengers on 18 England‐bound flights from European cities up to 12/03/2020, using manifests received for contact tracing. Infectious passengers were laboratory‐confirmed cases with symptom onset from 7 days before to 2 days after the flight. Possible aircraft‐acquired cases were laboratory‐confirmed with onset 3‐14 days post‐flight with no known non‐flight exposure. Manifests was merged with the national case management dataset (identifying cases, onset dates, contact tracing status) and the national COVID‐19 linelist. Contact tracing notes were reviewed to identify non‐flight exposures. We calculated attack rates (ARs) among all co‐passengers and within subgroups, including by distance from infectious cases and number of infectious cases on‐board. RESULTS: There were 55 infectious passengers and 2313 co‐passengers, including 2221 flight‐only contacts. Five possible aircraft‐acquired cases were identified; ARs of 0.2% (95%CI 0.1‐0.5) among all flight‐only contacts and 3.8% (95%CI 1.3‐10.6) among contact‐traced flight‐only contacts sat within a two‐seat radius. The AR among 92 co‐travellers with known non‐flight exposure to infectious cases was 13.0% (95%CI 7.6%‐21.4%). There were insufficient numbers to assess differences between subgroups. CONCLUSION: We conclude that risk of symptomatic COVID‐19 due to transmission on short to medium‐haul flights is low, and recommend prioritising contact‐tracing of close contacts and co‐travellers where resources are limited. Further research on risk on aircraft is encouraged.","Blomquist, Paula Bianca; Bolt, Hikaru; Packer, Simon; Schaefer, Ulf; Platt, Steven; Dabrera, Gavin; Gobin, Maya; Oliver, Isabel",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,423,20

The aim of this study was to examine the sustained impacts of COVID-19 prevention measures on the diet and exercise habits, risk for food insecurity, and quality of life among adults in the U.S. We conducted a longitudinal study using a convenience sample of participants recruited via Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) platform between March 30 and April 7, 2020, and 8 months into the outbreak, from November 2 to November 21, 2020. We compared self-reported diet and exercise habits and risk for food insecurity shortly after the pandemic began, in April, to those reported in November. We also measured changes in quality-of-life using the PROMIS-29 + 2 (PROPr) scale. A total of 636 respondents completed both surveys. Compared to reports in April, respondents ate lunch and dinner out more frequently in November and consumed more take-out and fast food. Weekly frequencies of consuming frozen food and the number of daily meals were slightly lower in November than they were in April. 54% of respondents screened positively for being at risk for food insecurity in April, reducing to 41% by November. In April, survey respondents were found to have lower quality-of-life relative to U.S. population norms, but by November levels of depression and cognitive function had improved. Our findings underscore how the initial effects of the pandemic on diet, exercise, risk for food insecurity, and quality of life have evolved. As U.S. states re-open, continued efforts to encourage healthy eating and support mental health, especially to reduce feelings of anxiety and social isolation, remain important to mitigate the potential long-term effects of the pandemic.","Rogers, Alexandra M; Lauren, Brianna N; Woo-Baidal, Jennifer A; Ozanne, Elissa M; Hur, Chin",Appetite,423,2

To date, little has been published about PLWH's perspective on the ACA. We explored ACA knowledge, HIV stigma, trust in the healthcare system, and ACA attitudes among PLWH with ADAP-funded QHPs in Virginia. METHODS: Participants were surveyed about demographic characteristics, ACA knowledge, HIV stigma, trust in various healthcare and government entities, and attitudes toward the ACA. Descriptive statistics were used. We assessed for associations (1) between baseline characteristics and correct ACA knowledge, HIV-related stigma, trust, and ACA attitudes and (2) between correct ACA knowledge and the following data: sources of ACA knowledge, HIV stigma, and trust. RESULTS: Participants (n = 53) were a vulnerable population based on the assessment of social determinants of health, and 30% had correct ACA knowledge. Almost three-fourths of participants used HIV clinic case managers for ACA information. Participants who used websites for ACA information had correct ACA knowledge more often compared to those that did not (71% vs. 15%; p = 0.001). Those with correct ACA knowledge had lower stigma scores compared to those without correct ACA knowledge (93.8; SD: 15.4 vs. 108; SD: 20.3; p = 0.01). Participants trusted HIV clinicians more than general clinicians and insurance companies. No association was found between having correct ACA knowledge and endorsing having enough information about the ACA to understand how it will impact their HIV care. CONCLUSIONS: Websites imparted accurate ACA information. HIV clinic case managers were the most used source, and HIV clinicians were a trusted source of information. HIV clinicians and case managers should consider disseminating information about the ACA and its impact on HIV care delivery via internet videos. Lack of internet and stigma are a threat to PLWH gaining actionable healthcare information.","Kaperak, Christopher; Elwood, Sarah; Saint-Surin, Tamara; Winstead-Derlega, Christopher; Brennan, Robert O.; Dillingham, Rebecca; McManus, Kathleen A.",AIDS Res Treat,423,1

Point-of-Care ultrasound (POCUS) scanning, becoming one of the primary determinative methods for its diagnosis and staging, requires, however, close contact of healthcare workers with patients, therefore increasing the risk of infection. This work thus proposes an autonomous robotic solution that enables POCUS scanning of COVID-19 patients’ lungs for diagnosis and staging. An algorithm was developed for approximating the optimal position of an ultrasound probe on a patient from prior CT scans to reach predefined lung infiltrates. In the absence of prior CT scans, a deep learning method was developed for predicting 3D landmark positions of a human ribcage given a torso surface model. The landmarks, combined with the surface model, are subsequently used for estimating optimal ultrasound probe position on the patient for imaging infiltrates. These algorithms, combined with a force–displacement profile collection methodology, enabled the system to successfully image all points of interest in a simulated experimental setup with an average accuracy of 20.6 ± 14.7 mm using prior CT scans, and 19.8 ± 16.9 mm using only ribcage landmark estimation. A study on a full torso ultrasound phantom showed that autonomously acquired ultrasound images were 100% interpretable when using force feedback with prior CT and 88% with landmark estimation, compared to 75 and 58% without force feedback, respectively. This demonstrates the preliminary feasibility of the system, and its potential for offering a solution to help mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in vulnerable environments.","Al-Zogbi, Lidia; Singh, Vivek; Teixeira, Brian; Ahuja, Avani; Bagherzadeh, Pooyan Sahbaee; Kapoor, Ankur; Saeidi, Hamed; Fleiter, Thorsten; Krieger, Axel",Front Robot AI,423,26

This is unexpected for a virus with a low mutation rate due to an inherent proof-reading system. Could such a variant arise under very special conditions occurring in a host where the virus replicates and mutates in a rather unlimited fashion, such as in immune compromised patients? The virus was shown to replicate in an immunosuppressed cancer patient for more than 105 days and might be a source of new variants. These patients are asymptomatic and the virus may therefore escape detection and attention and be high-risk. Similarly, HIV-infected individuals may be immunocompromised and support coronavirus replication with increased mutation rates. The patients may promote “within-host evolution”. Some of the viruses present in such a highly mutagenic swarm or quasispecies within one patient may become founders and cause a pandemic by further “between-host evolution”. B.1.1.7 with 23 mutations may be such a case. Immunosuppressed patients can be identified and treated by the synthetic antibody cocktails as passive immunization and kept under control. Immunosuppressed patients can be easily identified and supervised by healthcare workers—once they become aware of the risk—to avoid new variants with pandemic potential.","Moelling, Karin",Viruses,423,33

Mexico adopted lockdown and physical distancing as a containment strategy with potential consequences on day to day life, such as social isolation, loss of income and loneliness that can have important consequences in terms of mental health. Objective: We aimed to examine the effect of the initial phases of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychological distress, well-being and perceived physical health among Mexican-base respondents and to examine whether coping strategies would play a potential intermediating role in relation to these variables. Under the Existential Positive Psychology perspective, an emphasis was made on meaning-centered coping. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted between April 30 and June 16th 2020 among 604 Mexicans-base respondents of which 471 were women and 132 men. Data was collected by using online questionnaires. Psychological distress was measured using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). The Brief COPE Inventory was used to assess problem-focused and emotion-focused coping strategies. We also used the Meaning-Centered Coping Scale (MCCS). PERMA-Profiler was used to assess well-being, perceived physical health, and loneliness. Profiler and Descriptive analyses and bivariate linear regression were performed to examine the association of variables. Results: 45.9% of the participants reported moderate to extremely severe psychological distress. Our results demonstrate that problem-focused and emotion-focused coping were positively related to psychological distress, whereas meaning-centered coping was negatively associated with distress. Furthermore, psychological distress played a potential negative role in the perceived physical health, while meaning-centered coping and well-being buffered the negative influence of psychological distress on perceived physical health (completely standardized indirect effect = –0.01, SE: 0.012, 95% CI [−0.065; −0.017]. Conclusion: Meaning-centered coping was found to suppress the negative influence of psychological distress on sensation of decreased physical health corroborating the critical role of meaning in life in promoting well-being. Future studies can further examine the value of the critical role of meaning in life in promoting well-being as a protective factor against severe distress during traumatic events. Findings of this study can be used to orient policies and interventions aimed to alleviate suffering in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Quiroga-Garza, Angelica; Cepeda-Lopez, Ana C.; Villarreal Zambrano, Sofía; Villalobos-Daniel, Victor E.; Carreno, David F.; Eisenbeck, Nikolett",Front Psychol,423,26

RT-PCR of nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) has been established as sensitive gold standard for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Yet, additional test strategies are in demand to increase and broaden testing opportunities. As one attractive option, saliva has been discussed as an alternative to NPS as its collection is simple, non-invasive, suited for children and amenable for mass- and home-testing. MethodsHere, we report on the outcome of a head-to-head comparison of SARS-CoV-2 detection by RT-PCR in saliva and nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) of 1187 adults and children reporting to outpatient test centers and an emergency unit for an initial SARS-CoV-2 screen. ResultsIn total, 252 individuals were tested SARS-CoV-2 positive in either NPS or saliva. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results in the two specimens showed a high agreement (Overall Percent Agreement = 98.0%). Despite lower viral loads in saliva, we observed sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva up to a threshold of Ct 33 in the corresponding NPS (Positive Percent Agreement = 97.7%). In patients with Ct above 33 in NPS, agreement rate dropped but still reaches notable 55.9%. ConclusionThe comprehensive parallel analysis of NPS and saliva reported here establishes saliva as a reliable specimen for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 that can be readily added to the diagnostic portfolio to increase and facilitate testing.

While countries worldwide have been pursuing different school reopening strategies, most countries are planning to keep schools open during the whole winter season 2020/21. This poses a controversial issue: ventilation of classrooms (an essential mitigation factor for airborne transmission) is expected to sensibly decrease due to outdoor temperatures getting colder and regulators going to allow less restrictive policies on windows closure. Moreover, most schools are not provided with mechanical ventilation/filtartion systems to date. Fundamental and urgent questions to be addressed are therefore: to which extent can we contain the airborne transmission risk in schools through natural ventilation only? can we reduce the airborne risk with easy to implement countermeasures like lowering the speaking volume? To answer these questions a theoretical risk model based on the emission rate of viral charge from an infective subject has been developed extending previous models for tubercolosis and influenza. The case of an infective student or an infective teacher in a classroom, as well as an infective teacher with microphone have been investigated and compared with infection thresholds for different group sizes. The model also considers the influence of indoor-outdoor temperature difference on the air exchange rate, which seems to be particularly strong during winter.","Zivelonghi, A.; Lai, M.",,423,20

However, if the variance of the time series varies with time, the 95% confidence interval estimated by the ARIMA will not be accurate. This study proposes a method to revise the ARIMA model to suit time series with heteroscedasticity. METHODS: Multiple historical ARIMA models were constructed with publicly available COVID-19 data in Alberta, Canada. The time series between different time periods were applied for these models. The means and their 95% confidence intervals of the differences between the forecasted values and the corresponding actual values were computed. The forecasted values of the general ARIMA models were modified by adding these differences. RESULTS: The average incident cases forecasted with the proposed method are lower than those with general ARIMA models during the forecasted period. The 95% confidence intervals of the forecasted incidence with the proposed method are narrower. During the forecasted period (13 weeks) the average incidence was predicted to increase first and then decrease exponentially. CONCLUSION: The proposed method can be used to automatically specify the best ARIMA model, to fit time series with heteroscedasticity and to forecast longer period of the trends in the future. In the next 13 weeks, the Covid-19 incidence may decrease but not eliminate. To stop the transmission of infections eventually, persistent effects comply with accurate forecasts are necessary.","Sun, Jian",Comput Methods Programs Biomed Update,423,16

However, the role of physical activity in this context is still debated. By taking advantage of a previous survey, conducted online from 22 April to 7 May 2020, we performed a post-hoc analysis with the aim to assess the associations between disability, physical exercise, and mental health in multiple sclerosis. We retrieved the following data: (i) sociodemographic information, (ii) changes in lifestyle (including exercise), (iii) physical disability, as measured with the Patient-Determined Disease Steps scale, and (iv) anxiety feelings and depressive symptoms assessed via the items included in the Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders measurement system. Examination of the interaction plot showed that the effect of disability on depression, but not on anxious symptoms, was significant for all levels of physical exercise (low: b = 1.22, 95% C.I. 0.85, 1.58, p < 0.001; moderate: b = 0.95, 95% C.I. 0.66, 1.24, p < 0.001; and high: b = 0.68, 95% C.I. 0.24, 1.13, p = 0.003). Based on these data, we can conclude that disability significantly impacted depression during the COVID-19 pandemic, with physical activity playing a moderating role. Our results suggest that favoring exercise in multiple sclerosis (MS) would ameliorate psychological wellbeing regardless of the level of physical disability.","Carotenuto, Antonio; Scandurra, Cristiano; Costabile, Teresa; Lavorgna, Luigi; Borriello, Giovanna; Moiola, Lucia; Inglese, Matilde; Trojsi, Francesca; Petruzzo, Martina; Ianniello, Antonio; Nozzolillo, Agostino; Cellerino, Maria; Boffa, Giacomo; Rosa, Laura; Chiodi, Alessandro; Servillo, Giuseppe; Moccia, Marcello; Bonavita, Simona; Filippi, Massimo; Petracca, Maria; Brescia Morra, Vincenzo; Lanzillo, Roberta",J Clin Med,423,24

The study aimed at exploring whether quantitative viral load of COVID-19-infected case indicated by cycle threshold (Ct) value of real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction could predict about transmission pattern in the community. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An observational study was conducted involving 1976 individuals, suspected to be suffering from COVID-19 and contacts, of laboratory confirmed cases from selected districts of Gujarat, India. A total of 138 persons were detected to be positive. Weekly positivity showed an overall increasing trend during the studied weeks. It was observed that only 7% had high, 9% as moderate and rest, 84% had low viral load based on Ct values of real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: Most secondary cases clustered around index cases with high viral load whereas fewer secondary cases clustered around index cases with low viral load. Each index high viral load case transmitted an average of 6.25 secondary cases whereas the same of low viral load transmitted an average of 0.8 case. CONCLUSION: If cases with higher viral load are selectively isolated on detection from the rest of the community along with contact tracing of all individuals, who came in contact with them during the previous 5 days, the quantum of transmission will reduce subsequently. Moreover, health-care workers often get infected while working, probably due to the fact that they often handle cases with higher viral load. The Ct value of all may be provided along with test report to safeguard everybody's health including health-care workers.","Sarkar, Bidisa; Sinha, Rabindra Nath; Sarkar, Kamalesh",Indian J Community Med,423,6

Assessment of the politics, production, financing, and economics of this international effort has suggested six lessons that might be pertinent to the pursuit of other global health goals. First, such goals should be based on technically sound strategies with proven operational feasibility in a large geographical area. Second, before launching an initiative, an informed collective decision must be negotiated and agreed in an appropriate international forum to keep to a minimum long-term risks in financing and implementation. Third, if substantial community engagement is envisaged, efficient deployment of sufficient resources at that level necessitates a defined, time-limited input by the community within a properly managed partnership. Fourth, although the so-called fair-share concept is arguably the best way to finance such goals, its limitations must be recognised early and alternative strategies developed for settings where it does not work. Fifth, international health goals must be designed and pursued within existing health systems if they are to secure and sustain broad support. Finally, countries, regions, or populations most likely to delay the achievement of a global health goal should be identified at the outset to ensure provision of sufficient resources and attention. The greatest threats to poliomyelitis eradication are a financing gap of US$210 million and difficulties in strategy implementation in at most five countries.","Aylward, R Bruce; Acharya, Arnab; England, Sarah; Agocs, Mary; Linkins, Jennifer",Lancet,423,21

Prior use of RASIs was associated with a lower mortality in the over-68 group of patients, whereas no evidence of a similar effect (whether protective or adverse) was found in the younger group. There was positive relative excess due to a statistically significant (p =0.001) interaction between prior RASI exposure and an age greater than 68 years, corresponding to a positive relative excess risk. Next we used the subgroup of 411 hypertensive patients older than 68 yrs to separately assess the effects prior use of two RASI drug subclasses, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiogiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), by comparing these two exposures with no exposure to RASIs.

For all of the 23 cationic amphiphilic drugs we tested, including hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, amiodarone, and four others already in clinical trials, phospholipidosis was monotonically correlated with antiviral efficacy. Conversely, drugs active against the same targets that did not induce phospholipidosis were not antiviral. Phospholipidosis depends on the physicochemical properties of drugs and does not reflect specific target-based activities-rather, it may be considered a toxic confound in early drug discovery.

Now is opportune to gain a deeper understanding of what may have happened. The findings can help inform mitigation strategies in the disease-affected countries. Methods In this work, we examine an essential factor that characterizes the disease transmission patterns: the interactions among people. We develop a computational model to reveal the interactions in terms of the social contact patterns among the population of different age-groups. We divide a city's population into seven age-groups: 0-6 years old (children); 7-14 (primary and junior high school students); 15-17 (high school students); 18-22 (university students); 23-44 (young/middle-aged people); 45-64 years old (middle-aged/elderly people); and 65 or above (elderly people). We consider four representative settings of social contacts that may cause the disease spread: (1) individual households; (2) schools, including primary/high schools as well as colleges and universities; (3) various physical workplaces; and (4) public places and communities where people can gather, such as stadiums, markets, squares, and organized tours. A contact matrix is computed to describe the contact intensity between different age-groups for each of the four settings. By integrating the four contact matrices with the next-generation matrix, we quantitatively characterize the underlying transmission patterns of COVID-19 among different populations. Findings We focus our study on 6 representative cities in China: Wuhan, the epicenter of COVID-19, together with Beijing, Tianjin, Hangzhou, Suzhou, and Shenzhen, which are five major cities from three key economic zones. The results show that the social contact-based analysis can readily explain the underlying disease transmission patterns as well as the associated risks (including both confirmed and unconfirmed cases). In Wuhan, the age-groups involving relatively intensive contacts in households and public/communities are dispersedly distributed. This can explain why the transmission of COVID-19 in the early stage mainly took place in public places and families in Wuhan. We estimate that Feb. 11, 2020 was the date with the highest transmission risk in Wuhan, which is consistent with the actual peak period of the reported case number (Feb. 4-14). Moreover, the surge in the number of new cases reported on Feb. 12-13 in Wuhan can readily be captured using our model, showing its ability in forecasting the potential/unconfirmed cases. We further estimate the disease transmission risks associated with different work resumption plans in these cities after the outbreak. The estimation results are consistent with the actual situations in the cities with relatively lenient control policies, such as Beijing, and those with strict control policies, such as Shenzhen. Interpretation With an in-depth characterization of age-specific social contact-based transmission, the retrospective and prospective situations of the disease outbreak, including the past and future transmission risks, the effectiveness of different interventions, and the disease transmission risks of restoring normal social activities, are computationally analyzed and reasonably explained. The conclusions drawn from the study not only provide a comprehensive explanation of the underlying COVID-19 transmission patterns in China, but more importantly, offer the social contact-based risk analysis methods that can readily be applied to guide intervention planning and operational responses in other countries, so that the impact of COVID-19 pandemic can be strategically mitigated.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey research. METHODS: Participants included 1855 men and women aged 18 and above, from different regions in the country and representing different sectors. They were recruited through the social media in a “snowball” sampling, and filled out a self-administered six-part survey: Demographic background, the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), the positive and negative affect scales (PANAS), the Conor and Davidson resilience scale, a questionnaire for measuring depressive symptoms, and questions regarding weight change based on the Israeli National Health and Nutrition (MABAT) survey. RESULTS: Routine physical activity (PA) was reported by 76.3% of the participants before the lockdown, 19.3% stopped exercising during this period, and 9.3% began exercising during the lockdown. The participants who were physically active during the lockdown period reported a higher level of resilience and positive feelings, and a lower level of depression, compared with those who were not physically active. People who were physically active during the lockdown maintained their weight compared with those who were inactive. Concerning weight change, 44.8% of the respondents maintained their weight, and a higher percentage of people reported weight gain than those who reported weight loss. CONCLUSIONS: Continuous PA before and during the COVID-19 lockdown were associated with higher resilience and positive emotions, and depressive symptoms, in people aged 18 and above. Although a causal link cannot be established, in light of the results of the present study, encouraging physical activity may contribute to improving mental health and a sense of self-efficacy, as well as to maintaining weight during a crisis.","Zach, Sima; Fernandez-Rio, Javier; Zeev, Aviva; Ophir, Miki; Eilat-Adar, Sigal",Isr J Health Policy Res,423,32

Furthermore, more than 80% of fresh water resources are being used for agriculture, and 40% of the total food produced annually, is wasted. One sustainable agricultural practice involves converting by-products from the food and agriculture industry into valuable biomass, such as black soldier flies. Black soldier fly larvae can feed on by-products, and convert them to protein, carbohydrates, and oil. Black soldier flies could be used for feed and food development using different processing methods including enzymatic hydrolysis. ABSTRACT: The effects of chemical protein extraction, and enzymatic hydrolysis with Alcalase, papain and pepsin, on the functional properties, antioxidant activity, amino acid composition and protein structure of black soldier fly (H. illucens) larval protein were examined. Alcalase hydrolysates had the highest degree of hydrolysis (p < 0.05), with the highest hydrolysate and oil fraction yield (p < 0.05). Pepsin hydrolysates showed the lowest oil holding capacity (p < 0.05), whereas no significant differences were observed among other enzymes and protein concentrates (p > 0.05). The emulsifying stability and foam capacity were significantly lower in protein hydrolysates than protein concentrate (p < 0.05). The antioxidant activity of protein hydrolysates from protein concentrate and Alcalase was higher than that with papain and pepsin (p < 0.05), owing to the higher hydrophobic amino acid content. Raman spectroscopy indicated structural changes in protein α-helices and β-sheets after enzymatic hydrolysis.","Batish, Inayat; Brits, Devon; Valencia, Pedro; Miyai, Caio; Rafeeq, Shamil; Xu, Yixiang; Galanopoulos, Magdalini; Sismour, Edward; Ovissipour, Reza",Insects,423,15

We show that quarantine on a ship with COVID-19 will lead to significant disease spread if asymptomatic infections are not identified. However, if the majority of the crew and passengers are immune or vaccinated to COVID-19, then quarantine would slow the spread. We also show that a disease similar to influenza, even with a ship with a fully susceptible crew and passengers, could be contained through quarantine measures.","Batista, Berlinda; Dickenson, Drew; Gurski, Katharine; Kebe, Malick; Rankin, Naomi",Math Biosci,423,27

We assessed the prevalence, clinical presentation and outcomes of dementia among subjects hospitalized for COVID19 infection. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: COVID wards in Acute Hospital in Brescia province, Northern Italy. PARTICIPANTS: We used data from 627 subjects admitted to Acute Medical wards with COVID 19 pneumonia. MEASUREMENTS: Clinical records of each patients admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of COVID19 infection were retrospectively analyzed. Diagnosis of dementia, modalities of onset of the COVID-19 infection, symptoms of presentation at the hospital and outcomes were recorded. RESULTS: Dementia was diagnosed in 82 patients (13.1%). The mortality rate was 62.2% (51/82) among patients affected by dementia compared to 26.2% (143/545) in subjects without dementia (p<0.001, Chi-Squared test). In a logistic regression model age, and the diagnosis of dementia resulted independently associated with a higher mortality, and patients diagnosed with dementia presented an OR of 1.84 (95% CI: 1.09–3.13, p<0.05).

Planning to ensure there is capability to treat those that become ill with the virus has led to an almost complete moratorium on elective work. This study evaluates the impact of COVID-19 on cancer, in particular surgical intervention, in patients with esophago-gastric cancer at a high-volume tertiary center. METHODS: All patients undergoing potential management for esophago-gastric cancer from 12 March to 22 May 2020 had their outcomes reviewed. Multi-disciplinary team (MDT) decisions, volume of cases, and outcomes following resection were evaluated. RESULTS: Overall 191 patients were discussed by the MDT, with a 12% fall from the same period in 2019, including a fall in new referrals from 120 to 83 (P = 0.0322). The majority of patients (80%) had no deviation from the pre-COVID-19 pathway. Sixteen patients had reduced staging investigations, 4 had potential changes to their treatment only, and 10 had a deviation from both investigation and potential treatment. Only one patient had palliation rather than potentially curative treatment. Overall 19 patients underwent surgical resection. Eight patients (41%) developed complications with two (11%) graded Clavien-Dindo 3 or greater. Two patients developed COVID-19 within a month of surgery, one spending 4 weeks in critical care due to respiratory complications; both recovered. Twelve patients underwent endoscopic resections with no complications. CONCLUSION: Care must be taken not to compromise cancer treatment and outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Excellent results can be achieved through meticulous logistical planning, good communication, and maintaining high-level clinical care.","Wahed, S; Chmelo, J; Navidi, M; Hayes, N; Phillips, A W; Immanuel, A",Dis Esophagus,423,32

To this point, Germany's COVID-19 infection numbers and death rate have been lower than those of many other nations. METHODS: This article summarizes the current regimen used in the field of orthopaedics in Germany during the COVID-19 pandemic. Internal university clinic guidelines, latest research results, expert consensus, and clinical experiences were combined in this article guideline. RESULTS: Every patient, with and without symptoms, should be screened for COVID-19 before hospital admission. Patients should be assigned to three groups (infection status unknown, confirmed, or negative). Patients with unknown infection status should be considered as infectious. Dependent of the infection status and acuity of the symptoms, patients are assigned to a COVID-19-free or affected zone of the hospital. Isolation, hand hygiene, and personal protective equipment is essential. Hospital personnel directly involved in the care of COVID-19 patients should be tested on a weekly basis independently of the presence of clinical symptoms, staff in the COVID-19-free zone on a biweekly basis. Class 1a operation rooms with laminar air flow and negative pressure are preferred for surgery in COVID-19 patients. Electrocautery should only be utilized with a smoke suction system. In cases of unavoidable elective surgery, a self-imposed quarantine of 14 days is recommended prior to hospital admission. CONCLUSION: During the current COVID-19 pandemic, orthopaedic patients admitted to the hospital should be treated based on an interdisciplinary algorithm, strictly separating infectious and non-infectious cases.

Adding the sixth member of the galectin family in chicken, a model organism for systematic profiling of these adhesion/growth-regulatory proteins, is a step toward comprehensive network monitoring. METHODS: Database mining and computational data processing are applied for gene detection, chromosomal location and sequence alignments. Cloning, recombinant production and fusion-protein technology gain access to the protein, mass spectrometry and gel electrophoresis/filtration provide analytical data. Haemagglutination, glycan microarray and cell assays assess binding capacity, and crystallography of a shortened variant (also analyzed by ultracentrifugation and small angle X-ray scattering) determines its structure. RESULTS: The gene for the galectin-related protein (GRP) is present exclusively in vertebrates with high-level sequence conservation and similar chromosomal positioning. The chicken protein is monomeric and has lost the canonical galectin property of binding lactose. The crystal structure of the variant without the 36-amino-acid extension at the start provides explanations for this lack of binding. CONCLUSIONS: Chicken GRP is special within this family of six proteins by being unable to bind lactose. The documented high degree of sequence conservation among vertebrate orthologues confers the status of a model for delineating an assumedly shared functionality to this GRP. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Biochemical characterization of a product of a gene under strong positive selection is a prerequisite for functional characterization. It is also essential for network monitoring by adding a new member to this lectin family.","García Caballero, Gabriel; Flores-Ibarra, Andrea; Michalak, Malwina; Khasbiullina, Nailya; Bovin, Nicolai V.; André, Sabine; Manning, Joachim C.; Vértesy, Sabine; Ruiz, Federico M.; Kaltner, Herbert; Kopitz, Jürgen; Romero, Antonio; Gabius, Hans-Joachim",Biochim Biophys Acta Gen Subj,423,26

In human liver, IFN-λ not only drives antiviral responses, but also promotes inflammation and fibrosis in viral and non-viral diseases. Here we demonstrate that macrophages are primary responders to IFN-λ, uniquely positioned to bridge the gap between IFN-λ producing cells and lymphocyte populations that are not intrinsically responsive to IFN-λ. While CD14(+) monocytes do not express the IFN-λ receptor, IFNLR1, sensitivity is quickly gained upon differentiation to macrophages in vitro. IFN-λ stimulates macrophage cytotoxicity and phagocytosis as well as the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and interferon stimulated genes that mediate immune cell chemotaxis and effector functions. In particular, IFN-λ induced CCR5 and CXCR3 chemokines, stimulating T and NK cell migration, as well as subsequent NK cell cytotoxicity. Using immunofluorescence and cell sorting techniques, we confirmed that human liver macrophages expressing CD14 and CD68 are highly responsive to IFN-λ ex vivo. Together, these data highlight a novel role for macrophages in shaping IFN-λ dependent immune responses both directly through pro-inflammatory activity and indirectly by recruiting and activating IFN-λ unresponsive lymphocytes.","Read, Scott A.; Wijaya, Ratna; Ramezani-Moghadam, Mehdi; Tay, Enoch; Schibeci, Steve; Liddle, Christopher; Lam, Vincent W.

Sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) self-care interventions offer the best solution for improving access to quality healthcare services with efficiency and economy. This manuscript documents country experience in introducing and scaling up two selected SRHR self-care interventions. A prospective qualitative study design was used and a semi-structured questionnaire was shared with identified SRHR private sector partners selected through convenience and purposive sampling. The two interventions include the use of misoprostol for postpartum hemorrhage and the use of subcutaneous depomedroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) as injectable contraceptive method. Data collection was done through emails and telephone follow-up calls. RESULTS: Nine of the 13 partners consulted for the study responded. The two selected self-care interventions are mainly supported by private sector partners (national and international nongovernmental organizations) having national or subnational existence. Their mandates include all relevant areas, such as policy advocacy, field implementation, trainings, supervision and monitoring. A majority of partners reported experience related to the use of misoprostol; it was introduced more than a decade ago, is registered and is procured by both public and private sectors. Subcutaneous DMPA is a new intervention, having been introduced only recently, and commodity availability remains a challenge. It is being delivered through health workers/providers and is not promoted as a self-administered contraceptive. Community engagement and awareness raising is reported as an essential element of successful field implementation; however, no beneficiary data was collected for the study. Training approaches differ considerably, are standalone or integrated with SRHR topics and their duration varies between 1 and 5 days, covering a range of cadres. CONCLUSION: Pubic sector ownership and patronage is essential for introducing and scaling up self-care interventions as a measure to support the healthcare system in delivering quality sexual and reproductive health services. Supervision, monitoring and reporting are areas requiring further support, as well as the leadership and governance role of the public sector. Standardization of trainings, community awareness, supervision, monitoring and reporting are required together with integration of self-care in routine capacity building activities (pre- and in-service) on sexual and reproductive health in the country.","Uzma, Qudsia; Hamid, Nausheen; Chaudhri, Rizwana; Mehmood, Nadeem; Aabroo, Atiya; Thom, Ellen; Gholbzouri, Karima; Mahaini, Ramez; Hemachandra, Nilmini",Health Research Policy and Systems,423,21

Vaccine support is still substantial in general, although vaccination fear has increased dramatically in recent decades. This is the first study aimed to determine the fear of the COVID-19 vaccination and the role of factors and reasons associated with fear in the Iraqi Kurdistan region. RESULTS: A total of 1188 participants responded to the questionnaire about their fears of the COVID-19 vaccine. The majority of participants had a medium level of fear (56.7%). Fear was significantly (p < 0.001) associated with major demographic characteristics, social media use (51.8%), and losing family members, while other variables (previous seasonal influenza vaccine, previous infection, chronic medical diseases) show no relationship. Fear of side effects such as blood clotting was reported by the majority (45.03%) and indicated positive relation (p < 0.016). On the other hand, a high proportion, 39.9% and 34.01%, were afraid of AstraZeneca and Pfizer (p < 0.001), respectively; however, only about 4.63% had fear of Sinopharm. CONCLUSIONS: The fear of COVID-19 vaccination was widespread in the Iraqi Kurdistan region. In this way, fear was related to significant variables. To reduce the fear of vaccines and increase public acceptance, authorities and the Ministry of Health should initiate a public awareness campaign. As a result, the public health crisis will significantly improve.","Tahir, Arazoo Issa; Ramadhan, Dilkhosh Shamal; Taha, Ari Ahmed; Abdullah, Rebar Yahya; Karim, Saad Kazim; Ahmed, Azad Karim; Ahmed, Shalaw Faris",Middle East Curr Psychiatry,423,1

No specific therapeutic agents or vaccines for COVID-19 are available, though several antiviral drugs, are under investigation as treatment agents for COVID-19. The use of convalescent plasma transfusion that contain neutralizing antibodies for COVID-19 has become the major focus. This requires mass screening of populations for these antibodies. While several countries started reporting population based antibody rate, its simple point estimate may be misinterpreted without proper estimation of standard error and confidence intervals. In this paper, we review the importance of antibody studies and present the 95% confidence intervals COVID-19 antibody rate for the Korean population using two recently performed antibody tests in Korea. Due to the sparsity of data, the estimation of confidence interval is a big challenge. Thus, we consider several confidence intervals using Asymptotic, Exact and Bayesian estimation methods. In this article, we found that the Wald method gives the narrowest interval among all Asymptotic methods whereas mid p-value gives the narrowest among all Exact methods and Jeffrey’s method gives the narrowest from Bayesian method. The most conservative 95% confidence interval estimation shows that as of 00:00 on September 15, 2020, at least 32,602 people were infected but not confirmed in Korea.","Apio, Catherine; Kamruzzaman, Md.; Park, Taesung",Genomics Inform,423,1

The aim of this study was to further elucidate the molecular properties and clinical characteristics of RSV infection. The study sample included 238 patients <5 years old who were hospitalized with clinical symptoms of upper or lower respiratory tract infection (URTI or LRTI) in the Pediatric Department at the First People's Hospital of Chenzhou, South China in 2014. We subjected nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) or nasal swab (NS) samples from the patients to indirect fluorescence assay screens. RSV G genes were amplified by reverse transcription‐PCR (RT‐PCR) and sequenced. Of the 238 patients screened, 64 (26.8%) were confirmed to have RSV infections. Of those 64 confirmed RSV infection cases, 39 (60.9%) had subtype BA9, 13 (20.3%) had the recently identified subtype ON1, 11 (17.2%) had subtype NA1, and 1 (1.6%) had subtype GB2. The predominant presentation was LRTI with coughing, sputum production, fever, and wheezing. RSV subtype NA1 and BA9 infections were found mostly in infants, whereas the age distribution of subtype ON1 infections was more uniform across the age bands. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that, compared with the prototype strain A2, all ON1 and most NA1 isolates had lost one potential N‐glycosylation site at amino acid 251 and 249 due to T251K and N249Y substitution, respectively. These findings suggest that NA1, BA9, and ON1 are the dominant RSV subtypes causing respiratory tract infections in young children presenting to the hospital in South China. J. Med.

BACKGROUND: The COVID‐19 pandemic has provoked widespread disruption to clinical nurses’ work. It is important to understand clinical nurses’ processes of coping during disasters to support the nursing workforce during events such as global pandemics. DESIGN: We employed the Corbin and Strauss variant of grounded theory methodology, informed by symbolic interactionism, and applied the EQUATOR guidelines for qualitative research publication (COREQ). METHODS: Data collection entailed semi‐structured interviews with experienced clinical nurses (n =20) across diverse settings. We analysed data by identifying key points in the nurses’ coping processes inductively building concepts around these points. RESULTS: The predictor of nurses’ outcomes in this grounded theory was their confidence in their ability to cope during the pandemic. When nurses lacked confidence, they experienced working in the context of acute COVID—a state of chaos and anxiety, with negative consequences for nurses. However, when nurses were confident in their abilities to cope with the pandemic, they experienced working in the context of chronic COVID, a calmer state of acceptance. There were many workplace factors that influenced nurses’ confidence, including adequacy of personal protective equipment, clear information and guidance, supportive leadership, teamwork and adequate staffing. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding clinical nurses’ experience of coping during COVID‐19 is essential to maintain the nursing workforce during similar disasters. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Nurse leaders can target areas that support nurses’ confidence, such as adequate PPE and staffing. In turn, increased confidence enables clinical nurses to cope during disasters such as a global pandemic.","Nowell, Lorelli; Dhingra, Swati; Andrews, Kimberley; Jackson, Jennifer",J Clin Nurs,423,18

Verdiá-Báguena et al., 2012 [12]). Here, we provide new significant insights on the involvement of lipids in the structure and function of the CoV E protein channel on the basis of three series of experiments. First, reversal potential measurements over a wide range of pH allow the dissection of the contributions to channel selectivity coming from ionizable residues of the protein transmembrane domain and also from the negatively charged groups of diphytanoyl phosphatidylserine (DPhPS) lipid. The corresponding effective pKas are consistent with the model pKas of the acidic residue candidates for titration. Second, the change of channel conductance with salt concentration reveals two distinct regimes (Donnan-controlled electrodiffusion and bulk-like electrodiffusion) fully compatible with the outcomes of selectivity experiments. Third, by measuring channel conductance in mixtures of neutral diphytanoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPhPC) lipids and negatively charged DPhPS lipids in low and high salt concentrations we conclude that the protein–lipid conformation in the channel is likely the same in charged and neutral lipids. Overall, the whole set of experiments supports the proteolipidic structure of SARS-CoV E channels and explains the large difference in channel conductance observed between neutral and charged membranes.","Verdiá-Báguena, Carmina; Nieto-Torres, Jose L.; Alcaraz, Antonio; DeDiego, Marta L.; Enjuanes, Luis; Aguilella, Vicente M.",Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Biomembranes,423,6

We report the changing epidemiology of travel-related illnesses over a 12-year period. METHODS: A single site GeoSentinel surveillance analysis was undertaken for 3460 ill returned travellers presenting to two public hospitals in Marseille, France from March 2003 to October 2015, with travel-related illnesses. Demographic characteristics, travel history, presenting symptoms and information on pre-travel consultations were collected. RESULTS: There was a predominance of travel to sub-Saharan Africa, in particular to Comoros archipelago. Tourism was the main reason for travel (1591/3460, 46%), followed by visiting friends or relatives (VFR) (895/3460, 26%), with a mean duration of 29 days; 35% (1212/3460) of travellers reported a pre-travel health consultation. The most common syndromic diagnoses were febrile systemic illness (1343, 39%), dermatologic (716, 21%), gastrointestinal (340, 10%) and respiratory/ear–nose–throat (331, ENT) (10%). Hospitalization rates were highest amongst travellers from sub-Saharan Africa (858/ 1632, 53%), and VFR (573/ 895, 64%, P < 0.001). Frequent diagnoses included malaria (797, 23%), dengue (96, 2.77%) and chikungunya (75, 2.17%), reflecting global trends. Comparison of two periods (2003–10 to 2011–15) demonstrated an increase in chikungunya and decrease in malaria and influenza-like illness. We report an increase in ill travellers from the Caribbean, Middle East and South-East Asia. CONCLUSION: Surveillance of travellers provides relevant sentinel information on the changing epidemiology of infectious diseases across the globe, most notably for malaria, dengue and chikungunya. We demonstrate the use of travel surveillance in improving pre-travel consultation needs and to address autochthonous vector-borne viral risks.","Griffiths, Karolina M; Savini, Hélène; Brouqui, Philippe; Simon, Fabrice; Parola, Philippe; Gautret, Philippe",J Travel Med,423,20

Sustained increases to demand stemming from population growth, aging populations, and rising comorbidities has caused waiting times internationally to rise. This has resulted in increased calls for higher funding from governments and commitments from both state and national governments to address excessive waiting times. This paper aims to determine the effectiveness of government funding for improving the median waiting times for treatment and the proportion of patients seen within clinically recommended waiting times. For this purpose, an econometric analysis was conducted on a panel of data on Victorian local health networks over the period 2015 to 2018. This is supplemented with a discussion of the alternative measures which governments might take to both address demand for emergency treatment, and also ensure that waiting time reductions can be maintained over the long-term.","McQuestin, Dana; Noguchi, Masayoshi",Health Policy,423,16

Comparing the data before and after the introduction of restrictive measures (night curfew, partial closure of schools and businesses, smart working), we observed a significant decrease of infections in workplaces, social gatherings, coffee shops, restaurants, and sports centers; contagion in schools decreased from 9.8% to 3.4%, in hospitals environments and nursing homes from 5.2% to 2%; domestic infections increased instead from 72.8% to 92.7%. These results suggest that containment measures have been effective in controlling virus circulation in the community but not at the household level and might inform future interventions, including the establishment of structures (Covid Hotels) for the isolation infected people.

Design We conducted a mixed-methods analysis (quantitative and qualitative) of responses to a survey accessed through a UK online post-COVID support and information hub between April 2020 and December 2020 about people's experiences after having acute COVID-19. Participants Of 3290 respondents, 78% were female, median age range 45-54 years, 92.1% reported white ethnicity; 12.7% had been hospitalised. 494 respondents (16.5%) completed the survey between 4 and 8 weeks of the onset of their symptoms, 641 (21.4%) between 8 and 12 weeks and 1865 (62.1%) more than 12 weeks after. Results The ongoing symptoms most frequently reported were; breathing problems (92.1%), fatigue (83.3%), muscle weakness or joint stiffness (50.6%), sleep disturbances (46.2%), problems with mental abilities (45.9%) changes in mood, including anxiety and depression (43.1%) and cough (42.3%). Symptoms did not appear to be related to the severity of the acute illness or to the presence of pre-existing medical conditions. Analysis of free text responses revealed three main themes (1) Experience of living with COVID-19 - physical and psychological symptoms that fluctuate unpredictably; (2) Interactions with healthcare; (3) Implications for the future - their own condition, society and the healthcare system and the need for research Conclusion People living with persistent problems after the acute phase of COVID-19 report multiple and varying symptoms that are not necessarily associated with initial disease severity or the presence of pre-existing health conditions. Many have substantial unmet needs and experience barriers to accessing healthcare. Consideration of patient perspective and experiences will assist in the planning of services to address this.","Buttery, S. C.; Philip, K. E. J.; Williams, P.

This analysis is inspired by the Guidelines for an Institutional Code of Ethics in Higher Education drawn up by the International Association of Universities and the Magna Charta Observatory. These Guidelines refer to the principle of solidarity in the context of international cooperation between higher education institutions. However, the author of this paper believes that this principle might also be used in a broader academic context, in particular, in the field of academic ethics and academic integrity. Therefore, this paper aims at revealing the relevance of solidarity in academia and argues that the principle of solidarity can be considered as one of fundamental principles of academic ethics and should be reflected in the structure and provisions of the codes of academic ethics (conduct). For this purpose the author explores the philosophical and sociological approaches towards solidarity and defines the concept of academic solidarity, discusses the conceptual connection between academic solidarity, ethics and integrity and illustrates the impact of solidarity on the development of academic integrity. This analysis allows the author of the paper to recommend embedding the principle of solidarity in the codes of academic ethics of higher education institutions as well as extending the scope of its application by linking the rights and responsibilities of different groups within the academic community in a way that best expresses their unity, shared responsibility, mutual support in meeting the standards of social ethos.","Bieliauskaitė, Jolanta",J Acad Ethics,423,16

Efficacious vaccines should, at some point, be offered to placebo participants, which will occur before long-term efficacy and safety are known. METHODS: Following vaccination of the placebo group, we show that placebo-controlled vaccine efficacy can be derived by assuming the benefit of vaccination over time has the same profile for the original vaccine recipients and the placebo crossovers. This reconstruction allows estimation of both vaccine durability and potential vaccine-associated enhanced disease. RESULTS: Post-crossover estimates of vaccine efficacy can provide insights about durability, identify waning efficacy, and identify late enhancement of disease, but are less reliable estimates than those obtained by a standard trial where the placebo cohort is maintained. As vaccine efficacy estimates for post-crossover periods depend on prior vaccine efficacy estimates, longer pre-crossover periods with higher case counts provide better estimates of late vaccine efficacy. Further, open-label crossover may lead to riskier behavior in the immediate crossover period for the unblinded vaccine arm, confounding vaccine efficacy estimates for all post-crossover periods. CONCLUSIONS: We advocate blinded crossover and continued follow-up of trial participants to best assess vaccine durability and potential delayed enhancement of disease. This approach allows placebo recipients timely access to the vaccine when it would no longer be proper to maintain participants on placebo, yet still allows important insights about immunological and clinical effectiveness over time.","Follmann, Dean; Fintzi, Jonathan; Fay, Michael P.; Janes, Holly E.; Baden, Lindsey; Sahly, Hana El; Fleming, Thomas R.; Mehrotra, Devan V.; Carpp, Lindsay N.; Juraska, Michal; Benkeser, David; Donnell, Deborah; Fong, Youyi; Han, Shu; Hirsch, Ian; Huang, Ying; Huang, Yunda; Hyrien, Ollivier; Luedtke, Alex; Carone, Marco; Nason, Martha; Vandebosch, An; Zhou, Honghong; Cho, Iksung; Gabriel, Erin; Kublin, James G.; Cohen, Myron S.; Corey, Lawrence; Gilbert, Peter B.; Neuzil, Kathleen M.",medRxiv,423,20

The long-lived, complex, higher vertebrates have evolved specialized, adaptive immune systems designed to minimise the consequences of such parasitism. Through evolutionary time, the differential selective pressures exerted variously by the need for virus and host survival have shaped both the “one-host” and vertebrate immunity. With the development of vaccines to protect us from many of our most familiar parasites, the most dangerous pathogens threatening us now tend to be those “emerging”, or adventitious, infectious age sporadically enter human populations from avian or other wild-life reservoirs. Such incursions must, of course, have been happening through the millenia, and are likely to have led to the extraordinary diversity of recognition molecules, the breadth in effector functions, and the persistent memory that distinguishes the vertebrate, adaptive immune system from the innate response mechanisms that operate more widely through animal biology. Both are important to contemporary humans and, particularly in the period immediately following infection, we still rely heavily on an immediate response capacity, elements of which are shared with much simpler, and more primitive organisms. Perhaps we will now move forward to develop useful therapies that exploit, or mimic, such responses. At this stage, however, most of our hopes for minimizing the threat posed by viruses still focus on the manipulation of the more precisely targeted, adaptive immune system.","Doherty, P.

If a public health emergency like the COVID-19 outbreak exacerbates the SWM problem, its true importance as an imperative service becomes more apparent. The crisis triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic has changed the dynamics of waste generation globally in nearly every sector and has therefore raised the need for special attention. The unpredictable variations in the quantity and composition of waste also pressurize policymakers to react dynamically. This review highlights the major problems faced during the pandemic by SWM sector and the underlying possibilities to fill the gaps in the existing system. The review focuses on particular areas that have been the most important cause of concern throughout the crisis in the process of waste management. In addition, the mixing of virus infected biomedical waste with the stream of normal solid waste and lack of active involvement of the citizen and cooperation presents the major negative safety and health concerns for the workers involved in the sanitation process. Apart from presenting innovative solutions to tackle current waste management issues, this study also proposes several key potential guidelines to holistically mitigate possible future pandemics, if any.

Since then, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread worldwide becoming a pandemic. Beyond the risks strictly related to the infection, concerns have been expressed for the psychological impact that COVID-19 may have, especially on vulnerable individuals with pre-existing mental health conditions. Somatic symptom disorder (SSD) is characterized by a dysfunctional preoccupation with physical symptoms leading to excessive and unnecessary healthcare utilization. Despite being quite common, such condition remains underrecognized. We report a detailed clinical case of a 16 years old adolescent, who presented with a history suggestive of COVID-19 infection and associated psychological distress. Despite testing negative for the presence of SARS-CoV-2, his extreme and persisting health preoccupations required an inpatient admission to the Child and Adolescent Neuropsychiatric Unit. He responded rapidly to a low dose of antipsychotic and an antidepressant. Based on his medical history and current presentation, he received a diagnosis of SSD. When COVID-19-like symptoms occur, we highlight the importance of differentially diagnosing a possible exacerbation of a pre-existing SSD, triggered by fear of being infected. This may help preventing further burden to the healthcare system.","Colizzi, Marco; Bortoletto, Riccardo; Silvestri, Marta; Mondini, Federica; Puttini, Elena; Cainelli, Chiara; Gaudino, Rossella; Ruggeri, Mirella; Zoccante, Leonardo",Brain Behav Immun Health,423,24

PURPOSE: To perform a meta-analysis to evaluate diagnostic performance measures, including predictive values, of chest CT and initial reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). MATERIALS AND METHODS: MEDLINE and Embase were searched from January 1, 2020 to April 3, 2020 for studies on COVID-19 that reported the sensitivity and/or specificity of CT scans and/or RT-PCR assays. The pooled sensitivity and specificity were estimated by using random-effects models. The actual prevalence (i.e., the proportion of confirmed patients among those tested) in eight countries was obtained from web sources, and the predictive values were calculated. Meta-regression was performed to reveal the effect of potential explanatory factors on the diagnostic performance measures. RESULTS: The pooled sensitivity was 94% (95% CI: 91%, 96%; I(2)=95%) for chest CT and 89% (95% CI: 81%, 94%; I(2)=90%) for RT-PCR. The pooled specificity was 37% (95% CI: 26%, 50%; I(2)=83%) for chest CT. The prevalence of COVID-19 outside China ranged from 1.0% to 22.9%. For chest CT scans, the positive predictive value (PPV) ranged from 1.5% to 30.7%, and the negative predictive value (NPV) ranged from 95.4% to 99.8%. For RT-PCR,the PPV ranged from 47.3% to 96.4%, while the NPV ranged from 96.8% to 99.9%.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed by distributing a multidimensional survey to spine surgeons worldwide. Questions addressed demographics, impacts and perceptions of COVID-19, and the presence of surgeon comorbidities, which included cancer, cardiac disease, diabetes, obesity, hypertension, respiratory illness, renal disease, and current tobacco use. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify specific comorbidities that influenced various impact measures. RESULTS: Across 7 global regions, 36.8% out of 902 respondents reported a comorbidity, of which hypertension (21.9%) and obesity (15.6%) were the most common. Multivariate analysis noted tobacco users were more likely to continue performing elective surgery during the pandemic (odds ratio [OR], 2.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.46–4.72; p = 0.001) and were less likely to utilize telecommunication (OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.31–0.86; p = 0.011), whereas those with hypertension were less likely to warn their patients should the surgeon become infected with COVID-19 (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.37–0.91; p = 0.017).

Inactivated virus formulated vaccines such as Hepatitis A and smallpox proved to be reliable approaches for immunization for prolonged periods. In this study, a gamma-irradiated inactivated virus vaccine does not require an extra purification process, unlike the chemically inactivated vaccines. Hence, the novelty of our vaccine candidate (OZG-38.61.3) is that it is a non-adjuvant added, gamma-irradiated, and intradermally applied inactive viral vaccine. Efficiency and safety dose (either 10(13) or 10(14) viral RNA copy per dose) of OZG-38.61.3 was initially determined in BALB/c mice. This was followed by testing the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of the vaccine. Human ACE2-encoding transgenic mice were immunized and then infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus for the challenge test. This study shows that vaccinated mice have lowered SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA copy numbers both in oropharyngeal specimens and in the histological analysis of the lung tissues along with humoral and cellular immune responses, including the neutralizing antibodies similar to those shown in BALB/c mice without substantial toxicity.

The discussion shows how some attempts have been made to unveil processes that preserve mainstream ideologies, benefiting those who are interested in the maintenance of migratory inflows of migrants with no rights, and some improvements have been achieved. Nevertheless, even if the COVID-19 crisis has created the possibility to make structural problems more visible, and indicated the direction to “build back better,” the cultural and structural variables that create a condition of hyperprecarity for more marginalized migrants seem to be unchanged.","Sanfelici, Mara",Am Behav Sci,423,1

We are studying here a potential bias induced by the daily number of tests which may be insufficient or vary over time. Indeed, tests are hard to produce at the early stage of the epidemic and can therefore be a limiting factor in the detection of cases. Such a limitation may have a strong impact on the reported cases data. Indeed, some cases may be missing from the official count because the number of tests was not sufficient on a given day. In this work, we propose a new differential equation epidemic model which uses the daily number of tests as an input. We obtain a good agreement between the model simulations and the reported cases data coming from the state of New York. We also explore the relationship between the dynamic of the number of tests and the dynamics of the cases. We obtain a good match between the data and the outcome of the model. Finally, by multiplying the number of tests by 2, 5, 10, and 100 we explore the consequences for the number of reported cases.","Griette, Quentin; Magal, Pierre",Infect Dis Model,423,29

The objectives of the project were to support a landscape analysis of how MSAs have been used in the prevention and control of VBDs; to develop a theoretical framework for guiding the implementation of interventions; and to test the recommendations in real-life conditions. To realize these objectives, the project supported several activities, including commissioning a series of scientific reviews on MSAs in 5 thematic areas, sharing the key findings of these reviews in workshops and events, and developing a guidance framework for the implementation of MSAs. These activities have produced the theoretical framework that will be tested in real-life conditions through the support of case studies. The collaboration on implementing multisectoral activities against VBDs will continue among TDR, the Swiss Tropical Public Health Institute, and new partners such as the WHO Water Sanitation and Hygiene Group, UNDP, and UN-Habitat, in order to face the challenges identified and propose solutions tailored to specific contexts.

Detailed analyses of the cleavage sequences and their evolution would give insights into the high pathogenicity of the H5N1 virus. HA segments were visually identifiable in the cellular automata (CA) image, and a feature gene segment (FGS) was only found in H5N1 rather than any other subtype. This FGS is a 30-bp gene segment mainly consisting of ‘A’ and ‘G’. When translated into amino acids the FGS converted into a sequence of mainly basic amino acids with positive charges. This feature amino acid segment (FAAS) was located in the cleavage site loop of HA which was potentially cleavable by various proteases. The 3D structure of H5N1 HA was reconstructed using homology modelling. It was found that the cleavage site loop was well exposed to potential proteases. The molecular surfaces were reconstructed to study how mutation and deletion of some amino acids in the FAAS affected the charge distribution. It was found that some mutations had severely changed the landscape of the charge distribution. Statistical analyses of FAAS were made with respect to when and where the H5N1 viruses were found. In 2005, there were less un-mutated FAAS than the other years according to temporal evolution, and more mutated FAAS appeared in China than other regions according to geographic distribution. These results are helpful for exploring the evolution of virus high pathogenicity.","Guo, XiaoLi; Zhu, YiSheng; Li, YiXue; Shi, Ping; Zhou, HaoKui; Yao, JinSong; Huang, ZhenDe; Wei, DongQing",Chin Sci Bull,423,28

Data from previous outbreaks highlighted the risk for a negative impact on HCWs' social and occupational functioning, but scant data have investigated this issue in the framework of the covid-19 pandemic. A number of effective interventions have been proposed to support mental health and well-being of HCWs in emerging infectious outbreaks, but it is important to acknowledge the differential impact of mental disorders on different dimensions of functioning. METHODS The study explored the associations between work and social functioning and PTSS, depression and anxiety in a sample of 265 frontline HCWs employed at a major university hospital in Italy (Pisa), facing the first period of the covid-19 pandemic. Individuals were assessed by means of the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) for PTSS, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) for depressive symptoms, the General Anxiety Disorder-7 Item (GAD-7) for anxiety symptoms and the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS) to assess work and social functioning. RESULTS Higher levels of functioning impairment were found among individuals with moderate to severe acute PTSS, depressive and anxiety symptoms with respect to those without. Acute PTSS and depressive symptoms were predictive factors of impairment in each domain of functioning analyzed. Anxiety symptoms were associated with impairment in both work and home management activities. Frontline activity was associated with impairment in both private and social leisure activities. CONCLUSIONS Long-term perspective studies are warranted to better investigate the psychopathological burden on HCWs' work and social functioning and to promote adequate intervention strategies.","Carmassi, Claudia; Pedrinelli, Virginia; Dell'Oste, Valerio; Bertelloni, Carlo Antonio; Cordone, Annalisa; Bouanani, Siham; Corsi, Martina; Baldanzi, Sigrid; Malacarne, Paolo; Dell'Osso, Liliana; Buselli, Rodolfo",Rivista di psichiatria,423,26

Serum amyloid A (SAA) and haptoglobin (Hp) are APPs that are produced during inflammation, and likely play a role in host immunological defence against Eimeria infection and the associated intestinal tissue damage. We investigated the involvement of SAA and HP in an experimental study, including three groups of calves: a control group (group 0, n = 11), and two groups infected with either 150,000 or 250,000 Eimeria zuernii oocysts (group 1 (n = 11) and group 2 (n = 12), respectively). The calves were monitored for 28 days and data was collected on oocyst excretion, faecal score, animal weight, and SAA and Hp serum concentrations. Generalized linear mixed models showed that the clinical symptoms, indicated by an increase in the number of oocysts in the faeces and severe diarrhoea, manifested at patency for group 1 and 2. Serum Hp and SAA levels also increased during this period. Hp appeared to be a more sensitive marker than SAA, and differences between groups 1 and 2 were observed only for Hp. Linear regression models showed a negative association between weight gain and Hp concentrations, calculated as the area under the curve (AUC) during the overall experimental period and the patency period. A similar result was seen for SAA only during the patency period. This result supports the assumption that reduced weight gain due to E. zuernii infection is an immunologically driven process that involves an increase in APPs. A random intercept regression model of oocyst shedding groups showed that calves shedding 1–500 oocysts had reduced concentrations of Hp, indicating that a different immunological reaction occurs during mild shedding of E. zuernii oocysts than during more intensive shedding. A similar model was used to examine associations between faecal scores and Hp concentrations for each group. Group 2 calves with haemorrhagic diarrhoea displayed higher Hp levels than calves in that group with lower faecal scores, which may be in response to an increased demand for Hp in the repair process as a result of haemolysis. APPs seem to play an important role in determining the course of E. zuernii infection in calves, which may enhance our understanding of the immunological reaction and development of this disease.","Lassen, Brian; Bangoura, Berit; Lepik, Triin; Orro, Toomas",Vet Parasitol,423,29

We conducted a cross-sectional survey with 1,912 university students during March and April 2020. Psychiatric symptoms in the mild or higher range based on clinical cut-offs were alarmingly prevalent: 67.05% reported traumatic stress symptoms, 46.55% had depressive symptoms, and 34.73% reported anxiety symptoms. Further, 19.56% endorsed some degree of suicidal ideation. We explored factors that may contribute to poor psychological health as well as those that may function as protective factors. Risk and protective factors examined included demographic variables, two known protective factors for mental health (mindfulness, perceived social support), four COVID-specific factors (COVID-19 related efficacy, perceived COVID-19 threat, perceived COVID-19 societal stigma, COVID-19 prosocial behavior) and screen media usage. Across psychiatric symptom domains, mindfulness was associated with lower symptom severity, while COVID-19 related financial stress, perceived COVID-19 societal stigma, and perceived COVID-19 threat were associated with higher symptom severity. COVID-19 threat and COVID-19 stigma showed main and interactive effects in predicting all mental health outcomes, with their combination associated with highest symptom severity. Average screen media device usage was 6 hours and usage was positively associated with depression. Female gender and COVID-19 prosocial behavior were associated with higher anxiety, while COVID-19 self-efficacy associated with lower anxiety symptoms.

There are now over 30 clinical trials evaluating if BCG vaccination can prevent or reduce the severity of COVID-19. However, the mechanism by which BCG vaccination can induce severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific T cell responses is unknown. Here, we identify 8 novel BCG-derived peptides with significant sequence homology to either SARS-CoV-2 NSP3 or NSP13-derived peptides. Using an in vitro co-culture system, we show that human CD4+ and CD8+ T cells primed with a BCG-derived peptide developed enhanced reactivity to its corresponding homologous SARS-CoV-2-derived peptide. As expected, HLA differences between individuals meant that not all persons developed immunogenic responses to all 8 BCG-derived peptides. Nevertheless, all of the 20 individuals that were primed with BCG-derived peptides developed enhanced T cell reactivity to at least 7 of 8 SARS-CoV-2-derived peptides. These findings provide an in vitro mechanism that may account, in part, for the epidemiologic observation that BCG vaccination confers some protection from COVID-19.","Eggenhuizen, Peter J.; Ng, Boaz H.; Chang, Janet; Fell, Ashleigh L.; Cheong, Rachel M.

METHODS: We retrospectively considered 826 consecutive patients with suspected COVID-19 presenting to our emergency department (ED) from February 21 to March 31, 2020, in a high disease prevalence setting. We enrolled patients who underwent CXR and rhino-oropharyngeal swab for real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). CXRs were evaluated by an expert radiologist; a second independent analysis was performed by two residents in consensus. All readers, blinded to rRT-PCR results, classified CXRs positive/negative depending on presence/absence of typical findings of COVID-19, using rRT-PCR as reference standard. RESULTS: We finally analysed 680 patients (median age 58); 547 (80%) tested positive for COVID-19. The diagnostic performance of CXR, interpreted by the expert reader, was as follows: sensitivity (79.0%; 95% CI: 75.3–82.3), specificity (81.2%; 95% CI: 73.5–87.5), PPV (94.5%;95% CI: 92.0–96.4), NPV (48.4%; 95% CI: 41.7–55.2), and accuracy (79.3%; 95% CI: 76.0–82.2). For the residents: sensitivity (75.1%; 95% CI: 71.2–78.7), specificity (57.9%; 95% CI: 49.9–66.4), PPV (88.0%; 95% CI: 84.7–90.8), NPV (36.2%; 95% CI: 29.7–43.0), and accuracy (71.6%; 95% CI: 68.1–75.0). We found a significant difference between the reporting sensitivity (p = 0.013) and specificity (p < 0.0001) of expert radiologist vs residents. CXR sensitivity was higher in patients with symptom onset > 5 days before ED presentation compared to ≤ 5 days (84.4% vs 70.7%). CONCLUSIONS: CXR showed a sensitivity of 79% and a specificity of 81% in diagnosing viral pneumonia in symptomatic patients with clinical suspicion of COVID-19.

As residents rely upon operative exposure and in-person didactic lectures for education, the disruptions caused by the pandemic have forced programs to revise how they educate residents. Here we surveyed program directors (PDs) to ascertain how they have altered the education and clinical care responsibilities of residents in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Surveys were sent to the PDs of all ACGME-accredited neurosurgery programs. Survey questions targeted changes in resident staffing and coverage, changes in didactic material delivery, and changes in resident wellness initiatives. PD concerns were also elicited. Results Of the 116 program PDs invited, 57 responded (49.1%). We found that most programs have reduced resident work weeks (65%) and in-hospital resident shift census (95%). Few have redeployed residents and most are increasingly relying on teleconferencing solutions for meetings and resident education. Most commonly programs are using faculty- (91%) or resident-led (65%) lectures, though nearly 75% are supplementing resident education with materials from the Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS). Continuing education in spite of decreased case volume and maintaining resident morale are cited as the most common concerns of PDs. Conclusion Here we find that there is great homogeneity in the responses of neurosurgical residency programs to the COVID-19 pandemic. Programs are increasingly incorporating teleconferencing platforms and third-party education materials, most commonly materials from the CNS. Additionally, most respondents indicated that their program has not redeployed residents in the care of COVID-19 positive patients. The results of the present study may assist program directors in developing a uniform resident curriculum and consider wellness initiatives during this time of crisis.","Pennington, Zach; Lubelski, Daniel; Khalafallah, Adham; Ehresman, Jeff; Sciubba, Daniel M.; Witham, Timothy F.; Huang, Judy",World Neurosurg,423,16

Among several plausible hypotheses, the most controversial is that large DNA viruses, such as poxviruses, led to the emergence of the eukaryotic cell nucleus. Several recent findings, including the discovery of a nucleus-like structure in prokaryotic viruses and prokaryotes possessing nucleus-like inner membranes, suggest genomic DNA compartmentalization not only in eukaryotes but also in prokaryotes. The sophisticated viral machinery of mimiviruses is thought to resemble the eukaryotic nucleus: DNA replicates both inside the viral factory and nucleus, which is at least partially surrounded by membranes and is devoid of ribosomes. Furthermore, several features of the recently identified Acanthamoeba castellanii medusavirus suggest that the evolutionary relationship between ancestral viral factory and eukaryotic nucleus. Notably, Ran, DNA polymerase, and histones show molecular fossils of lateral transfer of nuclear genes between the virus and host. These results suggest viral innovation in the emergence of the eukaryotic nucleus. According to these results, a new scenario explaining the origin of the eukaryotic nucleus from the perspective of viral participation is proposed.

The detergent extract contained the fusion protein (F) and the tetrameric and dimeric forms of the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein (HN). These proteins were purified by size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in the presence of 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulphate, by ion-exchange and metal chelate affinity HPLC in the presence of 0.1% decylpolyethyleneglycol, and by reversed-phase HPLC without prior removal of the detergent. The tetramer of HN and F could be purified by size-exclusion HPLC after dissociation of a micellar aggregate containing tetrameric HN and multimeric F. The F and HN proteins could be purified by ion-exchange HPLC. Pure F protein could be obtained after metal chelate affinity HPLC. The F protein and the dimer and tetramer of HN could be eluted from a large-pore (100 nm) reversed-phase column, but they were eluted as broad, overlapping peaks. Only after reduction of the virion extract, the relatively small (13–15 kilodaltons) F2 protein could be obtained in pure form.","Welling, Gjalt W.; Slopsema, Kunja; Welling-Wester, Sytske",Journal of Chromatography A,423,30

METHODS: Personal statements were abstracted from residency applications to a urology residency program. Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count, a validated text analysis software, characterized the linguistic content of the statements. Analyzed statements were compared according to gender of the applicant using multivariate analysis, examining the association of applicant gender and statement characteristics. Multivariate analysis was also performed to determine the association of personal statement characteristics with matching into urology residency. RESULTS: Of 342 analyzed personal statements, no significant difference was found in statement characteristics between matched and unmatched applicants. Male and female applicants wrote with the same degree of overall analytical thinking, authenticity, and emotional tone. Clout, a measure of portrayed confidence, was low for both genders. Female applicants used more social and affective process words. Male applicants used more words indicating a sense of community and acceptance. Female applicants had more references to women within their statements. CONCLUSIONS: Significant linguistic differences exist among personal statements written by men and women applying to urology residency. Word usage differences follow societal gender norms. Statement content demonstrates a difference between genders in perceived sense of belonging, highlighting the importance of gender concordant mentorship within the field.","Demzik, Alysen; Filippou, Pauline; Chew, Christopher; Deal, Allison; Mercer, Emily; Mahajan, Sejal; Wallen, Eric M.; Tan, Hung-Jui; Smith, Angela B",Urology,423,1

Widespread awareness of epidemiological and molecular characteristics of the dengue virus (DENV) is required. In 2014, we isolated the virus from patients and sequenced its genome. The sequences of DENV isolated from Guangdong and other countries screened since 2005 were studied to establish molecular evolutionary databases along with epidemiological data to explore its epidemiological, phylogenetic, and molecular characteristics. Causes underlying the occurrence of the dengue epidemic included importation and localization of the virus. The number of indigenous cases significantly exceeded that of imported cases. Dengue virus 1 is the most important serotype and caused the long-term epidemic locally. Based on the data available since 2005, DENV1 was divided into three genotypes (I, IV, and V). Only genotypes I and V were detected in 2014. In 2014, an epidemic involving old lineages of DENV1 genotype V occurred after 2 years of silence. The genotype was previously detected from 2009 to 2011. Genotype I, which caused recent epidemics, demonstrated a continuation of new lineages, and a predictive pattern of molecular evolution since 2005 among the four lineages was present. The DENV isolated from Guangdong was closely related to those causing large-scale epidemics in neighboring countries, suggesting the possibility of its import from these countries. The lack of sufficient epidemiological data and evidence on the local mosquito-borne DENV emphasizes the importance of studying the molecular evolutionary features and establishing a well-established phylogenetic tree for dengue prevention and control in Guangdong.","Yu, Jianhai; Li, Xujuan; He, Xiaoen; Liu, Xuling; Zhong, Zhicheng; Xie, Qian; Zhu, Li; Jia, Fengyun; Mao, Yingxue; Chen, Zongqiu; Wen, Ying; Ma, Danjuan; Yu, Linzhong; Zhang, Bao; Zhao, Wei; Xiao, Weiwei",Am J Trop Med Hyg,423,22

Specifically, Black citizens are more likely than their White counterparts to experience the dislocations associated with the coronavirus. Nor is the extent of racial differences fully known, given limitations to the testing, hospitalization, and other data currently compiled. What does emerge, however, is an understanding that the reported outcomes reflect social inequities rather than biological predispositions. The inequities flow from both historical forces and contemporary ones that leave sizeable fractions of the Black population without access to quality healthcare or safe environments. The discrepancies suggest that the development of safe and effective vaccines might not eliminate the racial disparities associated with COVID-19, for that development will not alone erode levels of structural racism in the society.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common sleep-associated breathing disease and is represented by repetitive experiences of constraint of the respiratory tract prompting to reduced or deficient breathing during sleep. Auto-Continuous positive airway pressure (Auto-CPAP) is a modality of respiratory ventilation used as gold standart in the treatment of OSA. OBJECTIVE: This study was performed to conclude the alteration of Auto-CPAP levels in OSA patients who had COVID-19 history. METHODS: Nineteen OSA patients who had cured COVID-19 and used Auto-CPAP were included in this study. Nightly Auto-CPAP 95th percentile pressure (95thpp), median CPAP pressure and AHI before COVID-19 disease and one month after COVID therapy were recorded from electronic cards of Auto-CPAP devices. RESULTS: Before COVID infection, average Auto-CPAP 95thpp was 8.56 ± 0.17 cm H(2)O. One month after COVID-19, average Auto-CPAP 95thpp was 9.78 ± 0.21 cm H(2)O (P < 0.01). While Median CPAP pressure was 7.49 ± 0.16 cm H(2)O before COVID, it was found to be 8.15 ± 0.19 cm H(2)O after the disease (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The increase in need of average Auto-CPAP 95thpp and median CPAP pressure in OSA patients who have had COVID-19 disease and use Auto-CPAP shows that this disease causes problems in both the lower and upper airways.","Fidan, Vural; Koyuncu, Handan; Akin, Okan",Am J Otolaryngol,423,1

Our goal was to evaluate for discordance in SARS‐CoV‐2 detection in hospitalized patients with COVID‐19 and tracheostomies based on the site analyzed. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review METHODS: This single‐institution study evaluated hospitalized patients with COVID‐19 who had tracheostomies placed during their treatment. We analyzed SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) results after tracheostomy. All included patients had nasopharyngeal (NP) and tracheal (TR) samples taken within a 48‐hour period, allowing us to characterize rate of test concordance. RESULTS: Forty‐five patients met our inclusion criteria. Thirty‐two (71.1%) patients had entirely concordant results after tracheostomy. However, 13 (28.9%) patients had at least one set of discordant results, the majority of which were NP negative and TR positive. There were no statistically significant differences in demographic or clinical variables, including time to tracheostomy and time to testing, among patients with concordant versus discordant SARS‐CoV‐2 results. CONCLUSION: This represents the first study to examine SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA NAAT concordance between NP and TR sites in hospitalized patients with COVID‐19 and tracheostomies. One‐third of patients demonstrated discordant testing when NP and TR specimens were collected within a 48‐hour time period. Thus, patients with tracheostomies may have a higher false‐negative rate if only one site is assessed for SARS‐CoV‐2. We recommend analyzing samples from both the nasopharynx and trachea for these patients until more prospective data exist.

Successful identification of unnatural infectious disease events can assist in rapid response, which relies on a sensitive risk assessment tool used for the early detection of deliberate attacks (i.e., bioterrorism). Methods: A systematic review was conducted according to the outline of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews. Published papers related to the detection of unnatural diseases were searched in MEDLINE (January 1927–April 2016), EMBASE (January 1937–March 2016), and Web of Science (January 1978–March 2016). Full texts were reviewed for the selection of studies on scoring systems specially designed to discern between unnatural and natural outbreaks. Results: A total of 1,753 papers were reviewed, of which we identified the following five scoring systems specifically designed for detecting unnatural outbreaks: (1) the Grunow–Finke epidemiological assessment tool, (2) potential epidemiological clues to a deliberate epidemic, (3) bioterrorism risk assessment scoring, (4) and (5) two modified scoring systems based on (3). Various criteria ranging from the information on perpetrators, type of agents, spatial distribution, and intelligence of deliberate release were involved. Of these systems, the Grunow–Finke assessment tool remains the most widely used, but has low sensitivity for correctly identifying unnatural epidemics when tested against actual historical outbreaks. Others were applied into a few scenarios but provided different perspectives for bioterrorism detection and bio-preparedness. Conclusion: There are few risk assessment tools for differentiating unnatural from natural epidemics. These tools are increasingly necessary and valuable, but improved scoring systems with higher sensitivity, specificity, timeliness, and wider application to biological attacks must be developed.","Chen, Xin; Chughtai, Abrar Ahmad; MacIntyre, C.

Design: A phenomenological approach was adopted using qualitative semi-structured interviews. Settings: Community organisations and places of worships in the West Midlands region of England. Participants: Community leaders were recruited through organisations representing BAME communities and religious places of worship. Results: A total of 19 participants took part. Participants alluded to historical and structural differences for the observed disparities in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. Many struggled with lockdown measures which impeded cultural and religious gatherings that were deemed to be integral to the community. Cultural and social practices led to many suffering on their own as discussion of mental health was still deemed a taboo within many communities. Many expressed their community reluctance to report symptoms for the fear of financial and physical health implications. They reported increase in hate crime which was deemed to be exacerbated due to perceived insensitive messaging from authority officials and historical structural biases. Access and adherence to government guidelines was an issue for many due to language and digital barriers. Reinforcement from trusted community and religious leaders encouraged adherence. Points of support such as food banks were vital in ensuring essential supplies during the pandemic. Many could not afford masks and sanitisers.

It is therefore important to quickly provide accurate predictions of how vulnerable geographic regions such as counties are to the spread of this virus. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to develop county-level prediction around near future disease movement for COVID-19 occurrences using publicly available data. METHODS: We estimated county-level COVID-19 occurrences for the period March 14 to 31, 2020, based on data fused from multiple publicly available sources inclusive of health statistics, demographics, and geographical features. We developed a three-stage model using XGBoost, a machine learning algorithm, to quantify the probability of COVID-19 occurrence and estimate the number of potential occurrences for unaffected counties. Finally, these results were combined to predict the county-level risk. This risk was then used as an estimated after-five-day-vulnerability of the county. RESULTS: The model predictions showed a sensitivity over 71% and specificity over 94% for models built using data from March 14 to 31, 2020. We found that population, population density, percentage of people aged >70 years, and prevalence of comorbidities play an important role in predicting COVID-19 occurrences. We observed a positive association at the county level between urbanicity and vulnerability to COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The developed model can be used for identification of vulnerable counties and potential data discrepancies.

We hypothesized that the regional prevalence of specific class I human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles, which shape the anti-viral immune response, might partly underlie these differences. Through an ecological approach, we analyzed whether a set of HLA alleles (A, B, C), known to be involved in the immune response against infections, correlates with COVID-19 incidence. COVID-19 data were provided by the National Civil Protection Department, whereas HLA allele prevalence was retrieved through the Italian Bone-Marrow Donors Registry. Among all the alleles, HLA-A*25, B*08, B*44, B*15:01, B*51, C*01, and C*03 showed a positive log-linear correlation with COVID-19 incidence rate fixed on 9 April 2020 in proximity of the national outbreak peak (Pearson’s coefficients between 0.50 and 0.70, p-value < 0.0001), whereas HLA-B*14, B*18, and B*49 showed an inverse log-linear correlation (Pearson’s coefficients between −0.47 and −0.59, p-value < 0.0001). When alleles were examined simultaneously using a multiple regression model to control for confounding factors, HLA-B*44 and C*01 were still positively and independently associated with COVID-19: a growth rate of 16% (95%CI: 0.1–35%) per 1% point increase in B*44 prevalence; and of 19% (95%CI: 1–41%) per 1% point increase in C*01 prevalence. Our epidemiologic analysis, despite the limits of the ecological approach, is strongly suggestive of a permissive role of HLA-C*01 and B*44 towards SARS-CoV-2 infection, which warrants further investigation in case-control studies. This study opens a new potential avenue for the identification of sub-populations at risk, which could provide Health Services with a tool to define more targeted clinical management strategies and priorities in vaccination campaigns.","Correale, Pierpaolo; Mutti, Luciano; Pentimalli, Francesca; Baglio, Giovanni; Saladino, Rita Emilena; Sileri, Pierpaolo; Giordano, Antonio",Int J Mol Sci,423,26

The guidelines delineated creation of a task force at each university; school-based risk screening based on travel history, occupation, contacts, and clusters; measures on self-management of health and quarantine; general hygiene measures (including wearing masks indoors); principles on ventilation and sanitization; regulations on school assemblies; a process for reporting suspected cases; and policies on school closing and make-up classes. It also announced that a class should be suspended if 1 student or staff member in it tested positive and that a school should be closed for 14 days if it had 2 or more confirmed cases.

As the number of cases worldwide overtakes one million, data reveals closed outbreaks in Hubei and South Korea, with a new slight increase in the number of infected people in the latter. Both of these countries have reached a plateau in the number of Total Confirmed Cases per Million (TCCpM) residents, suggesting a trend to be followed by other affected regions. Using Hubei's data as a basis of analysis, we have studied the spreading rate of COVID-19 and modelled the epidemic center for 10 European countries. We have also given the final TCCpM curves for Italy and Lombardia. The introduction of the α-factor allows us to analyse the different stages of the outbreak, compare the European countries amongst each other, and, finally, to confront the initial phase of the disease between Europe and South America. Methods: By dividing the TCCpM curves in multiple sections spanning short time frames we were able to fit each section to a linear model. By pairing then the angular coefficient (α factor) of each section to the total number of confirmed infections at the center of the corresponding time interval, we have analysed how the spreading rate of Covid-19 changes as more people are infected. Also, by modelling the TCCpM curves with an asymmetrical time integral of a Normal Distribution, we were able to study, by fitting progressively larger data ensembles, how the fitting parameters change as more data becomes available. Findings: The data analysis shows that the spreading rate of COVID-19 increases similarly for all countries in its early stage, but changes as the number of TCCpM in each country grows. Regarding the modelling of the TCCpM curves, we have found that the fitting parameters oscillate with time before reaching constant values. The estimation of such values allows the determination of better parameters for the model, which in turn leads to more trustworthy forecasts on the pandemic development. Interpretation: The analysis of the oscillating fitting parameters allows an early prediction of the TCC, epidemic center and standard deviation of the outbreak. The α factor and the recovered over confirmed cases ratio can be used to understand the pandemic development in each country and to compare the protective measures taken by local authorities and their impact on the spreading of the disease.","De Leo, Stefano; Maia, Gabriel Gulak; Solidoro, Leonardo",,423,1

The determinants of problematic nitrous oxide use in this ethnic group are discussed, including their low treatment demand with respect to nitrous oxide abuse related medical–psychological problems. Motives for using nitrous oxide are to relieve boredom, to seek out relaxation with friends and to suppress psychosocial stress and negative thoughts. Other motives are depression, discrimination and conflict with friends or parents. The taboo culture surrounding substance use—mistrust, shame and macho culture—frustrates timely medical/psychological treatment of Moroccan–Dutch problematic nitrous oxide users.

This study aimed to determine the COVID-19 vaccination intention among nurses and midwives in Cyprus and reveal the influential factors that affected their decision. An Internet-based cross-sectional survey was conducted between December 8 and 28, 2020. Data collection was accomplished using a self-administered questionnaire with questions about socio-demographic characteristics, questions assessing general vaccination-related intentions and behaviors, and the intention to accept COVID-19 vaccination. A sample of 437 responders answered the survey, with 93% being nurses and 7% midwives. A small proportion of the participants would accept a vaccine against COVID-19, while 70% could be qualified as “vaccine hesitant.” The main reasons for not receiving the COVID-19 vaccine were concerns about the vaccine's expedited development and fear of side effects. More females, individuals with a larger median age, and a higher number of years of working experience, intended to accept the COVID-19 vaccination, compared with those not intended to accept and undecided groups (p < 0.01). Having a seasonal flu vaccination in the last 5 years, receiving the vaccines recommended for health professionals, and working in the private sector were associated with a higher probability of COVID-19 vaccination acceptance. A considerable rate of nurses and midwives in Cyprus reported unwillingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine due to vaccine-related concerns. Our findings highlight the need for forthcoming vaccination campaigns and programs to tackle coronavirus vaccine hesitancy barriers to achieve the desirable vaccination coverage.","Fakonti, Georgia; Kyprianidou, Maria; Toumbis, Giannos; Giannakou, Konstantinos",Front Public Health,423,10

Design: Single-centre, analytical, dynamic cohort study. Participants: 2,701 adults ([≥]18 years) with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and/or clinico-radiological diagnosis of covid-19, who required hospital admission to covid-19 specific wards, between January 2020 and March 2021. There were 884 covid-19 admissions during the first wave (before 30 Jun 2020) and 1,817 during the second wave. Outcome measures: in-hospital covid-19 associated mortality, ascertained from clinical records and Medical Certificate Cause of Death. Results: The crude mortality rate was 25% lower during the second wave (2.23 and 1.66 deaths per 100 person-days in first and second wave respectively). However, after accounting for age, sex, dexamethasone, oxygen requirements, symptoms at admission and Charlson Comorbidity Index, mortality hazard ratio associated with covid-19 hospital admissions was 1.62 (95% confidence interval 1.26, 2.08) times higher in the second wave compared to the first. Conclusions: Analysis of covid-19 admissions recorded in St. Georges Hospital, shows a larger second epidemic wave, with a lower crude mortality in hospital admissions. Nevertheless, after accounting for other factors underlying risk of death for covid-19 admissions was higher in the second wave. These findings are temporally and ecologically correlated with an increased circulation of SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern 202012/1 (alpha).","Cusinato, M.; Gates, J.; Jajbhay, D.; Planche, T.; Ong, Y.-E.",,423,1

It is one of the main targets for the construction of vaccine candidates against Staphylococcus aureus. Most of the vaccines have met failure due to adverse reactions and toxicity reported during late clinical studies. To overcome this, an immunoinformatics approach is being used in the present study for the design of a multi-epitope vaccine to circumvent the problems related to toxicity and allergenicity. RESULTS: In this study, a multi-epitope vaccine against Staphylococcus aureus targeting TSST-1 was designed through an immunoinformatics approach. B cell and T cell epitopes were predicted in silico and mapped with linkers to avoid junctional immunogenicity and to ensure the efficient presentation of exposed epitopes through HLA. β-defensin and PADRE were adjusted at the N-terminal end of the final vaccine as adjuvants. Physiochemical parameters, antigenicity, and allergenicity of the vaccine construct were determined with the help of online servers. The three-dimensional structure of the vaccine protein was predicted and validated with various tools. The affinity of the vaccine with TLR-3 was studied through molecular docking studies and the interactions of two proteins were visualized using LigPlot(+). The vaccine was successfully cloned in silico into pET-28a (+) for efficient expression in E. coli K12 system. Population coverage analysis had shown that the vaccine construct can cover 83.15% of the global population. Immune simulation studies showed an increase in the antibody levels, IL-2, IFN-γ, TGF-β, B cell, and T cell populations and induced primary, secondary, and tertiary immune responses. CONCLUSION: Multi-epitope vaccine designed through a computational approach is a non-allergic and non-toxic antigen. Preliminary in silico reports have shown that this vaccine could elicit both B cell and T cell responses in the host as desired.","Kolla, Harish Babu; Tirumalasetty, Chakradhar; Sreerama, Krupanidhi; Ayyagari, Vijaya Sai",J Genet Eng Biotechnol,423,16

We here found that glucocorticoid-activating enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (HSD11B1), which converts inactive cortisone to the active cortisol and thereby regulates tissue glucocorticoid (GC) levels, was greatly upregulated by IFNγ and TNFα in human umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSCs) in a synergistic manner. While IFNγ alone was not able to induce HSD11B1, it could increase the activity of NF-kB and thus augment the upregulation of HSD11B1 by TNFα. Interestingly, the upregulation of HSD11B1 by IFNγ and TNFα also required glucocorticoid receptor. Furthermore, HSD11B1 was shown to be required for the expression of TNF-stimulated gene 6 (TSG-6), an important anti-inflammatory effector molecule of MSCs. Therefore, the inflammatory factors IFNγ and TNFα can promote GC metabolism and thereby drive the expression of anti-inflammatory factor TSG-6 in human UC-MSCs, forming a potential negative feedback loop. These findings help to understand the relationship between inflammation and GC metabolism.","Huang, Peiqing; Li, Yinghong; Xu, Chenchang; Melino, Gerry; Shao, Changshun; Shi, Yufang",Cell Death Discov,423,20

Confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported around the world; indeed, this infection has been declared a pandemic. Consequently, the scientific community is working hard to gain useful information about the history of this virus, its transmission, diagnosis, clinical features, radiological findings, research and development of candidate therapeutics as well as vaccines. This review aims to analyze the diagnostic techniques used to ascertain the COVID-19 infection, critically reviewing positive points and criticism for forensic implications, obviously including autopsy. Finally, this review proposes a practical workflow to be applied in the management of corpses during this outbreak of the COVID-19 infection, which could be useful in cases of future infectious disease emergencies. Analyzing the diagnostic methods, to date, virus nucleic acid RT-PCR represents the standard method used to ascertain the COVID-19 infection in living subjects and corpses, even if this technique has several criticisms: mainly, the staff should be highly specialized, working in high-throughput settings, able to handle high workloads and aware of health risks and the importance of the results. Thus, IgG/IgM serological tests have been developed, overcoming RT-qPCR duration, costs, and management, not requiring highly trained personnel. Nevertheless, serological tests present problems; the WHO recommends the use of these new point-of-care immunodiagnostic tests only in research settings. Furthermore, nothing has yet been published regarding the possibility of applying these methods during post-mortem investigations. In light of this scenario, in this review, we suggest a flow chart for the pathologist called on to ascertain the cause of death of a subject with historical and clinical findings of COVID-19 status or without any anamnestic, diagnostic, or exposure information. Indeed, the literature data confirmed the analytical vulnerabilities of the kits used for laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19, particularly during postmortem examinations. For these reasons, autopsy remains the gold standard method to ascertain the exact cause of death (from or with COVID-19 infection, or other causes), to consequently provide real data for statistical evaluations and to take necessary measures to contain the risks of the infection. Moreover, performing autopsies could provide information on the pathogenesis of the COVID-19 infection with obvious therapeutic implications.","Sessa, Francesco; Bertozzi, Giuseppe; Cipolloni, Luigi; Baldari, Benedetta; Cantatore, Santina; D’Errico, Stefano; Di Mizio, Giulio; Asmundo, Alessio; Castorina, Sergio; Salerno, Monica; Pomara, Cristoforo",J Clin Med,423,16

Few empirical studies have assessed whether and how these control measures may affect mental health, and no study has investigated the prevalence and impacts of the use of eHealth resources among pregnant women during the COVID-19 outbreak. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated (1) the effects of lockdown and mandatory quarantine on mental health problems (ie, anxiety and depressive symptoms), (2) the potential mediation effects of perceived social support and maladaptive cognition, and (3) the moderation effects of eHealth-related factors (ie, using social media to obtain health information and using prenatal care services during the COVID-19 pandemic) on pregnant women in China. METHODS: An online cross-sectional survey was conducted among 19,515 pregnant women from all 34 Chinese provincial-level administrative regions from February 25 to March 10, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 19,515 participants, 12,209 (62.6%) were subjected to lockdown in their areas of residence, 737 (3.8%) were subjected to mandatory quarantine, 8712 (44.6%) had probable mild to severe depression, 5696 (29.2%) had probable mild to severe anxiety, and 1442 (7.4%) had suicidal ideations. Only 640 (3.3%) participants reported that they used online prenatal care services during the outbreak. Significant sociodemographic/maternal factors of anxiety/depressive symptoms included age, education, occupation, the area of residence, gestational duration, the number of children born, complication during pregnancy, the means of using prenatal care services, and social media use for obtaining health information. Multiple indicators multiple causes modeling (χ(2)(14)=495.21; P<.05; comparative fit index=.99; nonnormed fit index=.98; root mean square error of approximation=.04, 90% CI 0.038-0.045) showed that quarantine was directly and indirectly strongly associated with poor mental health through decreased perceived social support and increased maladaptive cognition (B=.04; β=.02, 95% CI 0.01-0.02; P=.001), while lockdown was indirectly associated with mental health through increased social support and maladaptive cognition among pregnant women (B=.03; β=.03, 95% CI 0.02-0.03; P=.001). Multigroup analyses revealed that the use of social media for obtaining health information and the means of using prenatal care services were significant moderators of the model paths. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide epidemiological evidence for the importance of integrating mental health care and eHealth into the planning and implementation of control measure policies. The observed social and cognitive mechanisms and moderators in this study are modifiable, and they can inform the design of evidence-based mental health promotion among pregnant women.","Yang, Xue; Song, Bo; Wu, Anise; Mo, Phoenix K H; Di, Jiangli; Wang, Qian; Lau, Joseph T F; Wang, Linhong",J Med Internet Res,423,5

The virus has already infected more than 44 M people and the number of deaths reported has reached more than 1.1 M which may be attributed to lack of medicine. The traditional drug discovery approach involves many years of rigorous research and development and demands for a huge investment which cannot be adopted for the ongoing pandemic infection. Rather we need a swift and cost-effective approach to inhibit and control the viral infection. With the help of computational screening approaches and by choosing appropriate chemical space, it is possible to identify lead drug-like compounds for Covid-19. In this study, we have used the Drugbank database to screen compounds against the most important viral targets namely 3C-like protease (3CLpro), papain-like protease (PLpro), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and the spike (S) protein. These targets play a major role in the replication/transcription and host cell recognition, therefore, are vital for the viral reproduction and spread of infection. As the structure based computational screening approaches are more reliable, we used the crystal structures for 3C-like main protease and spike protein. For the remaining targets, we used the structures based on homology modeling. Further, we employed two scoring methods based on binding free energies implemented in AutoDock Vina and molecular mechanics—generalized Born surface area approach. Based on these results, we propose drug cocktails active against the three viral targets namely 3CLpro, PLpro and RdRp. Interestingly, one of the identified compounds in this study i.e. Baloxavir marboxil has been under clinical trial for the treatment of Covid-19 infection. In addition, we have identified a few compounds such as Phthalocyanine, Tadalafil, Lonafarnib, Nilotinib, Dihydroergotamine, R-428 which can bind to all three targets simultaneously and can serve as multi-targeting drugs. Our study also included calculation of binding energies for various compounds currently under drug trials. Among these compounds, it is found that Remdesivir binds to targets, 3CLpro and RdRp with high binding affinity. Moreover, Baricitinib and Umifenovir were found to have superior target-specific binding while Darunavir is found to be a potential multi-targeting drug. As far as we know this is the first study where the compounds from the Drugbank database are screened against four vital targets of SARS-CoV-2 and illustrates that the computational screening using a double scoring approach can yield potential drug-like compounds against Covid-19 infection.","Murugan, Natarajan Arul; Kumar, Sanjiv; Jeyakanthan, Jeyaraman; Srivastava, Vaibhav",Sci Rep,423,11

A panel of eight synthetic siRNAs targeting four different regions of the FCoV genome were tested for antiviral effects. Efficacy was determined by qRT-PCR of intracellular viral genomic and messenger RNA, TCID50 infectivity assay of extracellular virus, and direct IFA for viral protein expression. All siRNAs demonstrated an inhibitory effect on viral replication in vitro. The two most effective siRNAs, targeting the untranslated 5′ leader sequence (L2) and the nucleocapsid gene (N1), resulted in a >95% reduction in extracellular viral titre. Further characterisation of these two siRNAs demonstrated their efficacy when used at low concentrations and in cells challenged with high viral loads.

A high proportion of zoonoses originate from wildlife reservoirs. Rodents are the most numerous, widespread, and diverse group of mammals on the earth and are reservoirs for many zoonotic viruses responsible for significant morbidity and mortality. A better understanding of virome diversity in rodents would be of importance for researchers and professionals in the field. Therefore, we developed the DRodVir database (http://www.mgc.ac.cn/DRodVir/), a comprehensive, up-to-date, and well-curated repository of rodent-associated animal viruses. The database currently covers 7690 sequences from 5491 rodent-associated mammal viruses of 26 viral families detected from 194 rodent species in 93 countries worldwide. In addition to virus sequences, the database provides detailed information on related samples and host rodents, as well as a set of online analytical tools for text query, BLAST search and phylogenetic reconstruction. The DRodVir database will help virologists better understand the virome diversity of rodents. Moreover, it will be a valuable tool for epidemiologists and zoologists for easy monitoring and tracking of the current and future zoonotic diseases. As a data application example, we further compared the current status of rodent-associated viruses with bat-associated viruses to highlight the necessity for including additional host species and geographic regions in future investigations, which will help us achieve a better understanding of the virome diversities in the two major reservoirs of emerging zoonotic infectious diseases.","Chen, Lihong; Liu, Bo; Wu, Zhiqiang; Jin, Qi; Yang, Jian",J Genet Genomics,423,15

Germline integration of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are fossil evidence of past infections. Hence, characterization of novel ERVs provides insight into the ancient precursors of extant viruses and the evolutionary history of their hosts. Here, we report the discovery of a novel endogenous retrovirus present in the genome of a lemur, Coquerel’s sifaka (Propithecus coquereli). Using next-generation sequencing, we identified and characterized the complete genome sequence of a retrovirus, named prosimian retrovirus 1 (PSRV1). Phylogenetic analyses indicate that PSRV1 is a gamma-type betaretrovirus basal to the other primate betaretroviruses and most closely related to simian retroviruses. Molecular clock analysis of PSRV1 long terminal repeat (LTR) sequences estimated the time of endogenization within 4.56 MYA (±2.4 MYA), placing it after the divergence of Propithecus species. These results indicate that PSRV1 is an important milestone of lemur evolution during the radiation of the Propithecus genus. These findings may have implications for both human and animal health in that the acquisition of a gamma-type env gene within an endogenized betaretrovirus could facilitate a cross-species jump between vertebrate class hosts.","Apakupakul, Kathleen; Deem, Sharon L.; Maqsood, Rabia; Sithiyopasakul, Peeti; Wang, David; Lim, Efrem S.",Viruses,423,16

However, the simulations so far have been a far cry from reality. In this study, normal FST with a diurnal variation component was defined as a normal state, and a model of normal FST in daily life was individually reconstructed using VAE. Using the constructed model, the anomaly detection performance was evaluated by applying the Hotelling theory. As a result, the area under the curve (AUC) value in ROC analysis was confirmed to be 0.89 to 1.00 in two subjects.","Masaki, Ayaka; Nagumo, Kent; Iwashita, Yuki; Oiwa, Kosuke; Nozawa, Akio",Artif Life Robot,423,28

The most common symptoms of COVID‐19 are fever, sore throat, and shortness of breath. According to the anecdotal reports from the health care workers, it has been suggested that the virus could reach the brain and can cause anosmia, hyposmia, hypogeusia, and hypopsia. Once the SARS‐CoV‐2 has entered the central nervous system (CNS), it can either exit in an inactive form in the tissues or may lead to neuroinflammation. Here, we aim to discuss the chronic infection of the olfactory bulb region of the brain by SARS‐CoV‐2 and how this could affect the nearby residing neurons in the host. We further review the probable cellular mechanism and activation of the microglia 1 phenotype possibly leading to various neurodegenerative disorders. In conclusion, SARS‐CoV‐2 might probably infect the olfactory bulb neuron enervating the nasal epithelium accessing the CNS and might cause neurodegenerative diseases in the future.","Mahalaxmi, Iyer; Kaavya, Jayaramayya; Mohana Devi, Subramaniam; Balachandar, Vellingiri",J Cell Physiol,423,1

Responses were received from 135 persons from many different U.S. regions and 5 foreign countries. Respondents were generally individuals with very high levels of education and personal achievement. Results demonstrated wide diversity of responses regarding each of these interventions. None were strongly supported by a majority of respondents, but those receiving the largest proportions of strong support were social isolation (41%), wearing masks indoors (41%), and using the first antiCOVID vaccine (41%). MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccination was viewed much more positively than negatively but had the highest proportion of individuals who felt they had insufficient data to formulate an opinion. The largest number of strong negative assessments were toward lockdowns (37%). We speculate that the wide variation in perception of possible benefits from the surveyed interventions, most of which have been widely practiced by or imposed upon millions of individuals, in this highly accomplished older population at increased personal risk from COVID19 reflects the current absence of rigorous scientific proof of the efficacy of any these interventions, and the continuation of the epidemic despite the widespread utilization of most of them.","Schulman, J.

HA and S proteins are heavily glycosylated, making them potential targets for carbohydrate binding agents such as lectins. Here we show that the lectin FRIL, isolated from hyacinth beans (Lablab purpureus), has anti-influenza and anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. FRIL can neutralize 11 representative human and avian influenza strains at low nanomolar concentrations, and intranasal administration of FRIL is protective against lethal H1N1 infection in mice. FRIL binds preferentially to complex type N-glycans, and neutralizes viruses that possess complex type N-glycans on their envelopes. As a homotetramer, FRIL is capable of aggregating influenza particles through multivalent binding and trapping influenza virions in cytoplasmic late endosomes, preventing their nuclear entry. Remarkably, FRIL also effectively neutralizes SARS-CoV-2, preventing viral protein production and cytopathic effect in host cells. These findings suggest potential application of FRIL for prevention and/or treatment of influenza and COVID-19.","Liu, Yo-Min; Shahed-Al-Mahmud, Md.; Chen, Xiaorui; Chen, Ting-Hua; Liao, Kuo-Shiang; Lo, Jennifer M.; Wu, Yi-Min; Ho, Meng-Chiao; Wu, Chung-Yi; Wong, Chi-Huey; Jan, Jia-Tsrong; Ma, Che",Cell Rep,423,1

(2) To detect and quantify vaccine mRNA in human milk after BNT162b2 vaccination. Design: Gestational Immunity For Transfer 2 (GIFT-2) is a prospective cohort study of lactating mothers who were due to receive two doses of BNT162b2 vaccine, recruited between 5th February 2021 and 9th February 2021. Setting: Lactating healthcare workers living in Singapore Participants: Convenience sample of ten lactating healthcare workers. Human milk samples were collected at four time points: pre-vaccination, 1 to 3 days after dose one, 7 to 10 days after dose one, and 3 to 7 days after dose two of the BNT162b2 vaccine. Exposure: Two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine 21 days apart. Main Outcome and Measure: (i) SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA and IgG in human milk of lactating mothers who received BNT162b2 vaccine, (ii) Detection and quantification of vaccine mRNA in human milk after BNT162b2 vaccination. Results: Ten lactating healthcare workers aged 32.5 years (range 29 to 42) were recruited, with 40 human milk samples collected and analysed. SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA was predominant in human milk of lactating mothers who received BNT162b2 vaccine.

This study consisted of 96 studies involving 7004 cases. The mean age of pediatric cases was 6.48 years (95% CI 52.0–77.5), 90% had household contact, and 66% presented with mild to moderate clinical syndromes. The main symptoms were fever (47%, 95% CI 41–53%) and cough (42%, 95% CI 36–48%). About 23% of children were asymptomatic, 27% had comorbidity, and 29% had a co-infection.

COVID patient cohorts were identified by validated ICD-10 and serology codes per CDC guidelines from 1/20/2020 to 2/23/2021. A 1:1 matched propensity score analysis was conducted, adjusting for comorbidities and demographics, to calculate adjusted Risk Ratios (aRR) with 95% CI. 30-day COVID complications were examined with severe COVID being defined as a composite of mortality and ventilation. Subgroup analyses were also performed for HS patients on systemic antibiotics. In a matched sample of 2004 patients in each cohort, there was no statistically significant difference between HS-COVID patients and non-HS COVID patients in hospitalization (0.93[0.8-1.1]), acute respiratory distress syndrome (1.31 [0.8-2.2]), mechanical ventilation (1.06 [0.7-1.6]), mortality (1.00 [0.6-1.8]), and severe COVID (1.07 [0.8-1.5]) but there was a difference in sepsis (1.37 [1.0-1.9]). Subgroup analysis revealed that HS-COVID patients with a one-year history of systemic antibiotic use were at a higher risk for hospitalization (1.27 [1.01-1.6]) compared to HS-COVID patients without one-year history of systemic antibiotics wheras all other outcomes assessed had no differences. HS-COVID patients are not at higher risk for more severe COVID outcomes compared to COVID patients without HS. However, HS patients with a history of systemic antibiotics are at a higher risk for hospitalization compared to HS patients without a history of systemic antibiotics.

The present study aimed to systematically review the risk of death associated with MERS as well as risk factors for associated complications. METHODS: PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched for clinical and epidemiological studies on confirmed cases of MERS. Eligible articles reported clinical outcomes, especially severe complications or death associated with MERS. Risks of admission to intensive care unit (ICU), mechanical ventilation and death were estimated. Subsequently, potential associations between MERS-associated death and age, sex, underlying medical conditions and study design were explored. RESULTS: A total of 25 eligible articles were identified. The case fatality risk ranged from 14.5 to 100%, with the pooled estimate at 39.1%. The risks of ICU admission and mechanical ventilation ranged from 44.4 to 100% and from 25.0 to 100%, with pooled estimates at 78.2 and 73.0%, respectively. These risks showed a substantial heterogeneity among the identified studies, and appeared to be the highest in case studies focusing on ICU cases. We identified older age, male sex and underlying medical conditions, including diabetes mellitus, renal disease, respiratory disease, heart disease and hypertension, as clinical predictors of death associated with MERS. In ICU case studies, the expected odds ratios (OR) of death among patients with underlying heart disease or renal disease to patients without such comorbidities were 0.6 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.1, 4.3) and 0.6 (95% CI: 0.0, 2.1), respectively, while the ORs were 3.8 (95% CI: 3.4, 4.2) and 2.4 (95% CI: 2.0, 2.9), respectively, in studies with other types of designs. CONCLUSIONS: The heterogeneity for the risk of death and severe manifestations was substantially high among the studies, and varying study designs was one of the underlying reasons for this heterogeneity. A statistical estimation of the risk of MERS death and identification of risk factors must be conducted, particularly considering the study design and potential biases associated with case detection and diagnosis.

Within such interdisciplinary energy research, the novel domain of energy informatics plays an important role, as it involves different disciplines addressing the socio-techno-economic challenges of sustainable energy and power systems in a holistic manner. The objective of this paper is to draw an overview of the novel domain of energy informatics by addressing the educational opportunities as well as related challenges in light of current trends and the future direction of research and industrial innovation. In this study we discuss the energy informatics domain in a way that goes beyond a purely scientific research perspective. This paper widens the analyses by including reflections on current and future didactic approaches with industrial innovation and research as a background. This paper provides key recommendations for the content of a foundational introductory energy informatics course, as well as suggestions on distinguishing features to be addressed through more specialized courses in the field. The importance of this work is based on the need for better guidelines for a more appropriate education of a new generation of experts who can take on the novel interdisciplinary challenges present in future integrated, sustainable energy systems. ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS: Didactic approaches in the energy informatics domain are discussed based on research and industrial trends. Research trends and industrial innovation driven by energy informatics are investigated. A fundamental framework for an energy informatics course is defined together with specialized distinguishing features.","Bordin, Chiara; Mishra, Sambeet; Safari, Amir; Eliassen, Frank",SN Appl Sci,423,32

Here we report on a questionnaire-based retrospective cohort study of the prevalence and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among participants in swimming activities in Denmark in the last five months of 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Eight of 162 swimming activities with a SARS-CoV-2 positive participant led to transmission to 23 other participants. Overall, the percentage of transmission episodes was 4.9% (competitive swimming 8.9%; recreational swimming 1.3%). Overall, the incidence rate of transmission was 19.5 participants per 100.000 pool activity hours (corresponding values: 43.5 and 4.7 for competitive and recreational swimming, respectively). Compliance with precautionary restrictions was highest regarding hand hygiene (98.1%) and lowest in distancing personal sports bags (69.9%). Due to low statistical power, the study showed no significant effect of restrictions. Insight into the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 during indoor swimming is needed to estimate the efficiency of restrictive measures on this and other sports and leisure activities. Only when we know how the virus spreads through various settings, optimal strategies to handle the COVID-19 pandemic can be developed.","Termansen, M. B.; Christiansen, A. V.; Frische, S.",,423,16

We conducted a literature review of urology mHealth papers on PubMed. Results indicate that mHealth is becoming ubiquitous in contemporary healthcare systems. Although its potential has been shown, urology lags behind other areas, representing just 0.1% of the 300,000 available medical apps in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. Furthermore, there is a lack of expert healthcare professional involvement in app development. To avoid harm, it is critical that the scientific accuracy, patient privacy, and user safety of urology mHealth applications are assured. This is because there is no globally enforced medical app regulation, compulsory scientific guidelines, nor mandatory industry standards. Urologists, either individually or via scientific organizations, should have a pivotal position in the design, development, review, certification, and recommendation of apps. mHealth holds great potential in urology, as it can aid multiple stakeholders: citizens, patients, healthcare professionals, health organizations, and public authorities (e.g., Ministry of Health). Even though it is mostly used to improve existing medical activities at present, the future will include revolutionary and ground-breaking technology solutions. This innovative field should be seen by urologists as an opportunity to provide greater care to our patients and better tools and knowledge to our peers.","Pereira Azevedo, Nuno; Gravas, Stavros; de la Rosette, Jean",J Clin Med,423,16

Achieving optimal fluid balance is difficult in patients with disorders of fluid homeostasis such as diabetes insipidus (DI). There is little data on the use of Furosemide to aid in balancing fluid and electrolytes in patients with DI. Here, we present a critically ill 11-year-old female with developmental delay, septo-optic dysplasia, central DI, and respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19 ARDS. She required careful titration of a Vasopressin infusion in addition to IV Furosemide for successful management of fluid and electrolyte derangements. On admission, she demonstrated high-volume urine output with mild hypernatremia (serum sodium 156 mmol/L). Despite her maximum Vasopressin infusion rate of 8 mU/kg/hr, by day two of admission, she voided a total of 4 L resulting in severe hypernatremia (serum sodium 171 mmol/L). With continually high Vasopressin infusion rates, her overall fluid balance became increasingly net positive, although her hypernatremia persisted. Her ARDS continued to worsen. After 48 hours of the addition of intermittent Furosemide, successful diuresis along with resolution of hypernatremia was achieved. The combination of IV Furosemide with Vasopressin infusion resulted in tailored diuresis and more controlled titration of serum sodium levels than adjustment in Vasopressin and fluids alone. These results are in contradistinction to the published literature, which focuses on the use of thiazide diuretics in managing DI. This experience highlights the potential for loop diuretics to aid in establishing a desired fluid and electrolyte status in managing patients with both DI and ARDS.","Gungor, Sara D.; Woroniecki, Robert P.; Hulfish, Erin; Biagas, Katherine V.",Case Rep Crit Care,423,26

The NPIs are social distancing, isolation of infected individuals, identifying asymptomatically infected individuals through testing, and the use of face masks. The model uses a fear-based behavioral model that leads unmasked susceptible individuals to wear masks. The model parameters are estimated from the reported deaths for the United States of America from March 1, 2020 to November 26, 2020. Two GSA tools, the Sobol’ sesntivity indices and Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient are used to obtain the rankings of the input parameters at different stages of the disease propagation. We found that social distancing and outward mask efficiency alone decreases the output uncertainty by 25-45%. Sobol’ second order indices show that the combined effect of social distancing with increased mask usage and identifying and isolating asymptomatically infected individuals decreases uncertainty an additional 10%.","Arachchilage, Kalpana Hanthanan; Hussaini, Mohammed Yousuff",Chaos Solitons Fractals,423,17

In this study, via per-capita testing dependent ascertainment rates, along with case and death data, we fit a minimal epidemic model for each state. We estimate infection-level responsive lockdown entry and exit rates (representing government and behavioral reaction), along with the true number of cases as of May 31, 2020. Ultimately we provide error corrected estimates for commonly used metrics such as infection fatality ratio and overall case ascertainment for all 55 states and territories considered, along with the United States in aggregate, in order to correlate outbreak severity with first wave intervention attributes and suggest potential management strategies for future outbreaks. We observe a theoretically predicted inverse proportionality relation between outbreak size and lockdown rate, with scale dependent on the underlying reproduction number and simulations suggesting a critical population quarantine ""half-life"" of 30 days independent of other model parameters.","Gulbudak, H.; Browne, C.; Macdonald, J.

Furthermore, the relevance of these coagulation abnormalities has become a determining factor in the outcome of the sickest patients, as a substantial proportion of patients with severe clinical manifestations develop venous and arterial thromboembolic complications. These are often undiagnosed until post-mortem findings. Available evidence arising from clinical observations and autopsy reports distinguishes COVID-19-associated coagulopathy from thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Possible overlaps can be observed in critically ill patients, in whom circulatory collapse, multisystem organ failure, refractory hypoxaemia, and ARDS cause a combination of low-grade DIC and localised thrombotic pulmonary microangiopathy. These could have a substantial impact on organ dysfunction, in the most severely affected patients.","Morales, Oscar Alberto Sáenz; Rubio, Ana María; Yomayusa, Nancy; Gamba, Nelson; Fernández, Manuel Garay",,423,16

During the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak in South Korea in 2015, some dialysis patients in three centers who were incidentally exposed to patients or medical staff with confirmed MERS-CoV infection were isolated to interrupt the spread of the infection. We aimed to investigate post-traumatic stress symptoms and risk factors among these patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In total, 116 hemodialysis (HD) patients in contact with MERS-CoV-confirmed subjects were isolated using three strategies, namely, single room isolation, cohort isolation, and self-quarantine. We used the Impact of Event Scale-Revised-Korean (IES-R-K) to examine post-traumatic stress symptoms at 12 months after the isolation period. RESULTS: Of the 116 HD patients, 27 were lost to follow-up. Of the 89 patients, 67 (75.3%) completed the questionnaires. Single room isolation was used on 40 (58.8%) of the patients, cohort isolation on 20 (29.4%), and self-imposed quarantine on 8 (11.8%). In total, 17.9% of participants (n = 12) reported post-traumatic stress symptoms exceeding the IES-R-K’s cutoff point (≧18). Prevalence rates of IES-R-K ≧18 did not differ significantly according to isolation method. However, isolation duration was linearly associated with the IES-R-K score (standardized β coefficient − 0.272, P = 0.026). Scores in Avoidance, Emotional numbing and Dissociation subscale were higher in patients with longer isolation period. CONCLUSION: MERS was a traumatic experience for quarantined HD patients. IES-R-K scores were not significantly different by isolation methods. However, short isolation was associated with post-traumatic stress symptoms.","Cho, A Jin; Lee, Hong-Seock; Lee, Young-Ki; Jeon, Hee Jung; Park, Hayne Cho; Jeong, Da-Wun; Kim, Yang-Gyun; Lee, Sang-Ho; Lee, Chang-Hee; Yoo, Kyung Don; Wong, Ae Kyeong",Biopsychosoc Med,423,1

Unfortunately, the evidence on the factors linked to such disruption is limited, and no study has addressed the link among Bangladeshis. This study aimed to examine the socioeconomic, demographic, and other critical factors linked to the use of FP in the studied areas during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The characteristics of the respondents were assessed using a cross-sectional questionnaire survey and descriptive statistics. The variables that were substantially linked with FP usage were identified using a Chi-square test. In addition, a multivariate logistic regression model was used to identify the parameters linked to FP in the study areas during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: The prevalence of FP use among currently married 15–49 years aged women was 36.03% suggesting a 23% (approximately) decrease compared to before pandemic data. Results also showed that 24.42% of the respondents were using oral contraceptive pills (OCP) which is lower than before pandemic data (61.7%). Multivariate regression analysis provided broader insight into the factors affecting FP use. Results showed that woman’s age, education level of the respondents, working status of the household head, locality, reading a newspaper, FP workers’ advice, currently using OCP, ever used OCP, husbands’ supportive attitude towards OCP use, duration of the marriage, ever pregnant, the number of children and dead child were significantly associated with FP use in the study areas during COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: This study discusses unobserved factors that contributed to a reduction in FP use and identifies impediments to FP use in Bangladesh during the COVID-19 epidemic. This research further adds to our understanding of FP usage by revealing the scope of the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on FP use in Bangladesh’s rural and urban areas.","Roy, Nitai; Amin, Md.

Particularly, the case investigated is the one where the packet loss rate of the network is time-varying due to, for instance, variation in the distance between the nodes. Considering this practical motivation, the control system is modeled using a formulation based on discrete-time Markov jump linear systems (MJLS) with non-homogeneous Markov chains (time-varying transition probabilities). New control design conditions based on parameter-dependent linear matrix inequalities are proposed in order to solve this problem. The purpose is to demonstrate that this strategy is suitable to handle the networked control problem by comparing the temporal behavior of the closed-loop system with the Markovian controller and a standard proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller. The case study presented in the paper considers the problem of the remote control of a Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) vehicle through a wireless communication channel. The network packet loss model employed in the case study is based on data collected on a wireless network workbench, which was previously developed and validated by the authors.","Serafini, Arthur R.
