263,263,263,Heliox reduces respiratory system resistance in respiratory syncytial virus induced respiratory failure,12.628273,8.677742,2009-05-15,"INTRODUCTION: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract disease is characterised by narrowing of the airways resulting in increased airway resistance, air-trapping and respiratory acidosis. These problems might be overcome using helium-oxygen gas mixture. However, the effect of mechanical ventilation with heliox in these patients is unclear. The objective of this prospective cross-over study was to determine the effects of mechanical ventilation with heliox 60/40 versus conventional gas on respiratory system resistance, air-trapping and CO2 removal. METHODS: Mechanically ventilated, sedated and paralyzed infants with proven RSV were enrolled within 24 hours after paediatric intensive care unit (PICU)admission. At T = 0, respiratory system mechanics including respiratory system compliance and resistance, and peak expiratory flow rate were measured with the AVEA ventilator. The measurements were repeated at each interval (after 30 minutes of ventilation with heliox, after 30 minutes of ventilation with nitrox and again after 30 minutes of ventilation with heliox). Indices of gas exchange (ventilation and oxygenation index) were calculated at each interval. Air-trapping (defined by relative change in end-expiratory lung volume) was determined by electrical impedance tomography (EIT) at each interval. RESULTS: Thirteen infants were enrolled. In nine, EIT measurements were performed. Mechanical ventilation with heliox significantly decreased respiratory system resistance. This was not accompanied by an improved CO2 elimination, decreased peak expiratory flow rate or decreased end-expiratory lung volume. Importantly, oxygenation remained unaltered throughout the experimental protocol. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory system resistance is significantly decreased by mechanical ventilation with heliox (ISCRTN98152468).","Kneyber, Martin CJ; van Heerde, Marc; Twisk, Jos WR; Plötz, Frans B; Markhors, Dick G",Crit Care,102,28
406,406,406,Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 Influenza Community Transmission Was Established in One Australian State When the Virus Was First Identified in North America,12.609732,8.355817,2010-06-28,"BACKGROUND: In mid-June 2009 the State of Victoria in Australia appeared to have the highest notification rate of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza in the world. We hypothesise that this was because community transmission of pandemic influenza was already well established in Victoria at the time testing for the novel virus commenced. In contrast, this was not true for the pandemic in other parts of Australia, including Western Australia (WA). METHODS: We used data from detailed case follow-up of patients with confirmed infection in Victoria and WA to demonstrate the difference in the pandemic curve in two Australian states on opposite sides of the continent. We modelled the pandemic in both states, using a susceptible-infected-removed model with Bayesian inference accounting for imported cases. RESULTS: Epidemic transmission occurred earlier in Victoria and later in WA. Only 5% of the first 100 Victorian cases were not locally acquired and three of these were brothers in one family. By contrast, 53% of the first 102 cases in WA were associated with importation from Victoria. Using plausible model input data, estimation of the effective reproductive number for the Victorian epidemic required us to invoke an earlier date for commencement of transmission to explain the observed data. This was not required in modelling the epidemic in WA. CONCLUSION: Strong circumstantial evidence, supported by modelling, suggests community transmission of pandemic influenza was well established in Victoria, but not in WA, at the time testing for the novel virus commenced in Australia. The virus is likely to have entered Victoria and already become established around the time it was first identified in the US and Mexico.","Kelly, Heath A.; Mercer, Geoff N.; Fielding, James E.; Dowse, Gary K.; Glass, Kathryn; Carcione, Dale; Grant, Kristina A.; Effler, Paul V.; Lester, Rosemary A.",PLoS One,102,28
413,413,413,"Human bocaviruses are highly diverse, dispersed, recombination prone, and prevalent enteric infections",12.463047,8.728454,2010-06-01,"A new species of parvovirus tentatively named human bocavirus 4 (HBoV4) was genetically characterized. Among 641 feces samples from children and adults the most commonly detected bocaviruses species were HBoV2>HBoV3>HBoV4>HBoV1 with HBoV2 prevalence of 21% and 26% in Nigerian and Tunisian children. HBoV3 and HBoV4 species combined were found in 12/192 cases of non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) from Tunisia and Nigeria and 0/96 healthy Tunisian contacts (p=0.01). Evidence of extensive recombination at the NP1 and VP1 gene boundary between and within species was found. The multiple species and high degree of genetic diversity seen among the human bocaviruses found in feces relative to the highly homogeneous HBoV1 suggest that this world-wide distributed respiratory pathogen may have recently evolved from an enteric bocavirus, perhaps after acquiring an expanded tropism favoring the respiratory track. Elucidating the possible role of the newly identified enteric bocaviruses in human diseases including AFP and diarrhea will require further epidemiological studies.","Kapoor, A; Simmonds, P.; Slikas, B.; Li, Linlin; Bodhidatta, L.; Sethabutr, O.; Triki, H.; Bahri, Olfa; Oderinde, B.; Baba, M.; Bukbuk, D.; Besser, J.; Bartkus, J.; Delwart, E.",The Journal of Infectious Diseases,102,11
501,501,501,Pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza virus with the H275Y oseltamivir resistance neuraminidase mutation shows a small compromise in enzyme activity and viral fitness,12.627196,8.55407,2010-12-16,"BACKGROUND: Resistance to the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir can be conferred by a well-characterized mutation in the neuraminidase gene, H275Y. In human H1N1 viruses that circulated in the first years of the 21st century, this mutation carried a fitness cost and resistant viruses were rare. During the 2007–08 influenza season, oseltamivir-resistant viruses of H1N1 phenotype emerged and predominated. March 2009 saw the emergence of a novel H1N1 influenza pandemic. We examined whether the H275Y mutation affected neuraminidase enzyme activity or replication of the pandemic influenza virus. METHODS: Using reverse genetics we engineered the H275Y mutation into the neuraminidase of a 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus and assessed the ability of this enzyme to desialylate mono- and multivalent substrates. The growth kinetics of wild-type and mutant viruses were assessed in Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) and fully differentiated human airway epithelial (HAE) cells. RESULTS: The presence of H275Y was associated with a 1.3-fold decrease in the affinity of the neuraminidase for a monovalent substrate and a 4-fold compromise in desialylation of multivalent substrate. This was associated with a fitness cost to viral replication in vitro, which only became apparent during competitive replication in the mucus-rich HAE culture system. CONCLUSIONS: The neuraminidase protein of pandemic influenza isolates tolerates the H275Y mutation and this mutation confers resistance to oseltamivir. However, unlike seasonal H1N1 viruses isolated since 2007, the mutation is not associated with any fitness advantage and thus is unlikely to predominate without further antigenic drift, compensating mutations or intense selection pressure.","Brookes, Daniel W.; Miah, Shahajahan; Lackenby, Angie; Hartgroves, Lorian; Barclay, Wendy S.",J Antimicrob Chemother,102,28
650,650,650,Geographic Distribution and Risk Factors of the Initial Adult Hospitalized Cases of 2009 Pandemic Influenza A (H1N1) Virus Infection in Mainland China,12.538591,8.707764,2011-10-12,"BACKGROUND: As of 31(st) March 2010, more than 127,000 confirmed cases of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1), including 800 deaths, were reported in mainland China. The distribution and characteristics of the confirmed cases in the initial phase of this pandemic in this country are largely unknown. The present study aimed to characterize the geographic distribution and patient characteristics of H1N1 infection in the 2009 pandemic as well as to identify potential risk factors associated with adverse patient outcome in China, through retrospective analyses of 885 hospitalized cases with confirmed H1N1 infection. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The proportional hazards model was employed to detect risk factors for adverse outcome; the geo-statistical maps were used to characterize the distribution of all 2668 confirmed H1N1 patients throughout mainland China. The number of new cases increased slowly in May, 2009, but rapidly between June and August of the year. Confirmed cases were reported in 26 provinces; Beijing, Guangdong, Shanghai, Zhejiang and Fujian were the top five regions of the incidence of the virus infection. After being adjusted for gender, age, chronic pulmonary disease and other general symptoms, delay for more than two days before hospital admission (HR: 0.6; 95%CI: 0.5–0.7) and delayed onset of the H1N1-specific respiratory symptoms (HR: 0.3; 95%CI: 0.2–0.4) were associated with adverse patient outcome. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The 2009 pandemic influenza A affected east and southeast coastal provinces and most populous cities more severely than other regions in mainland China due to higher risk of high level traffic-, high population density-, and high population mobility-associated H1N1 transmission.The clinical symptoms were mild in the initial phase of infection. Delayed hospital admission and delayed appearance of respiratory symptoms were among the major risk factors for poor patient outcome. These findings may have significant implications in the future pandemic preparedness and response.","Liu, Yunning; Wang, Wei; Li, Xia; Wang, Hong; Luo, Yanxia; Wu, Lijuan; Guo, Xiuhua",PLoS One,102,28
653,653,653,Case-based reported mortality associated with laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H1N1) 2009 virus infection in the Netherlands: the 2009-2010 pandemic season versus the 2010-2011 influenza season,12.58679,8.598051,2011-10-04,"BACKGROUND: In contrast to seasonal influenza epidemics, where the majority of deaths occur amongst elderly, a considerable part of the 2009 pandemic influenza related deaths concerned relatively young people. In the Netherlands, all deaths associated with laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H1N1) 2009 virus infection had to be notified, both during the 2009-2010 pandemic season and the 2010-2011 influenza season. To assess whether and to what extent pandemic mortality patterns were reverting back to seasonal patterns, a retrospective analyses of all notified fatal cases associated with laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H1N1) 2009 virus infection was performed. METHODS: The notification database, including detailed information about the clinical characteristics of all notified deaths, was used to perform a comprehensive analysis of all deceased patients with a laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H1N1) 2009 virus infection. Characteristics of the fatalities with respect to age and underlying medical conditions were analysed, comparing the 2009-2010 pandemic and the 2010-2011 influenza season. RESULTS: A total of 65 fatalities with a laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H1N1) 2009 virus infection were notified in 2009-2010 and 38 in 2010-2011. During the pandemic season, the population mortality rates peaked in persons aged 0-15 and 55-64 years. In the 2010-2011 influenza season, peaks in mortality were seen in persons aged 0-15 and 75-84 years. During the 2010-2011 influenza season, the height of first peak was lower compared to that during the pandemic season. Underlying immunological disorders were more common in the pandemic season compared to the 2010-2011 season (p = 0.02), and cardiovascular disorders were more common in the 2010-2011 season (p = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: The mortality pattern in the 2010-2011 influenza season still resembled the 2009-2010 pandemic season with a peak in relatively young age groups, but concurrently a clear shift toward seasonal patterns was seen, with a peak in mortality in the elderly, i.e. ≥ 75 years of age.","van Gageldonk-Lafeber, Rianne AB; Riesmeijer, Rob M; Friesema, Ingrid HM; Meijer, Adam; Isken, Leslie D; Timen, Aura; van der Sande, Marianne AB",BMC Public Health,102,28
702,702,702,Mannose-Binding Lectin Contributes to Deleterious Inflammatory Response in Pandemic H1N1 and Avian H9N2 Infection,12.731905,8.747855,2011-11-11,"Background. Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is a pattern-recognition molecule, which functions as a first line of host defense. Pandemic H1N1 (pdmH1N1) influenza A virus caused massive infection in 2009 and currently circulates worldwide. Avian influenza A H9N2 (H9N2/G1) virus has infected humans and has the potential to be the next pandemic virus. Antiviral function and immunomodulatory role of MBL in pdmH1N1 and H9N2/G1 virus infection have not been investigated. Methods. In this study, MBL wild-type (WT) and MBL knockout (KO) murine models were used to examine the role of MBL in pdmH1N1 and H9N2/G1 virus infection. Results. Our study demonstrated that in vitro, MBL binds to pdmH1N1 and H9N2/G1 viruses, likely via the carbohydrate recognition domain of MBL. Wild-type mice developed more severe disease, as evidenced by a greater weight loss than MBL KO mice during influenza virus infection. Furthermore, MBL WT mice had enhanced production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines compared with MBL KO mice, suggesting that MBL could upregulate inflammatory responses that may potentially worsen pdmH1N1 and H9N2/G1 virus infections. Conclusions. Our study provided the first in vivo evidence that MBL may be a risk factor during pdmH1N1 and H9N2/G1 infection by upregulating proinflammatory response.","Ling, Man To; Tu, Wenwei; Han, Yan; Mao, Huawei; Chong, Wai Po; Guan, Jing; Liu, Ming; Lam, Kwok Tai; Law, Helen K.

722,722,722,Evaluation of the Seeplex® Meningitis ACE Detection Kit for the Detection of 12 Common Bacterial and Viral Pathogens of Acute Meningitis,12.525949,8.781235,2011-12-20,"BACKGROUND: Bacterial meningitis is an infectious disease with high rates of mortality and high frequency of severe sequelae. Early identification of causative bacterial and viral pathogens is important for prompt and proper treatment of meningitis and for prevention of life-threatening clinical outcomes. In the present study, we evaluated the value of the Seeplex Meningitis ACE Detection kit (Seegene Inc., Korea), a newly developed multiplex PCR kit employing dual priming oligonucleotide methods, for diagnosing acute meningitis. METHODS: Analytical sensitivity of the kit was studied using reference strains for each pathogen targeted by the kit, while it's analytical specificity was studied using the human genome DNA and 58 clinically well-identified reference strains. For clinical validation experiment, we used 27 control cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples and 78 clinical CSF samples collected from patients at the time of diagnosis of acute meningitis. RESULTS: The lower detection limits ranged from 10(1) copies/µL to 5×10(1) copies/µL for the 12 viral and bacterial pathogens targeted. No cross-reaction was observed. In the validation study, high detection rate of 56.4% was obtained. None of the control samples tested positive, i.e., false-positive results were absent. CONCLUSIONS: The Seeplex Meningitis ACE Detection kit showed high sensitivity, specificity, and detection rate for the identification of pathogens in clinical CSF samples. This kit may be useful for rapid identification of important acute meningitis-causing pathogens.","Shin, So Youn; Kwon, Kye Chul; Park, Jong Woo; Kim, Ji Myung; Shin, So Young; Koo, Sun Hoe",Ann Lab Med,102,22

The development stage of PERCH provided the time and resources necessary for us to conduct a comprehensive review of the current state of respiratory diagnostics. These efforts allowed us to articulate the unique requirements of PERCH, establish that molecular methods would be central to our testing strategy, and focus on a short list of candidate platforms. This process also highlighted critical challenges in the general design and interpretation of diagnostic evaluation studies, particularly in the field of respiratory infections. Although our final molecular diagnostic platform was ultimately selected on the basis of operational and strategic considerations determined by the specific context of PERCH, our review highlighted several conceptual and practical challenges in respiratory diagnostics that have broader relevance for the performance and interpretation of pneumonia research studies.","Bhat, Niranjan; O'Brien, Katherine L.; Karron, Ruth A.; Driscoll, Amanda J.; Murdoch, David R.",Clinical Infectious Diseases,102,1
789,789,789,Foxp3(+) Regulatory T Cells Control Persistence of Viral CNS Infection,12.667786,8.596337,2012-03-20,"We earlier established a model of a persistent viral CNS infection using two week old immunologically normal (genetically unmodified) mice and recombinant measles virus (MV). Using this model infection we investigated the role of regulatory T cells (Tregs) as regulators of the immune response in the brain, and assessed whether the persistent CNS infection can be modulated by manipulation of Tregs in the periphery. CD4(+) CD25(+) Foxp3(+) Tregs were expanded or depleted during the persistent phase of the CNS infection, and the consequences for the virus-specific immune response and the extent of persistent infection were analyzed. Virus-specific CD8(+) T cells predominantly recognising the H-2D(b)-presented viral hemagglutinin epitope MV-H(22–30) (RIVINREHL) were quantified in the brain by pentamer staining. Expansion of Tregs after intraperitoneal (i.p.) application of the superagonistic anti-CD28 antibody D665 inducing transient immunosuppression caused increased virus replication and spread in the CNS. In contrast, depletion of Tregs using diphtheria toxin (DT) in DEREG (depletion of regulatory T cells)-mice induced an increase of virus-specific CD8(+) effector T cells in the brain and caused a reduction of the persistent infection. These data indicate that manipulation of Tregs in the periphery can be utilized to regulate virus persistence in the CNS.","Reuter, Dajana; Sparwasser, Tim; Hünig, Thomas; Schneider-Schaulies, Jürgen",PLoS One,102,1

In humans the number of cases infected with this virus is few but the mortality has been about 60%. Most patients have presented with severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. The second influenza virus, the pandemic H1N1 2009, emerged in Mexico in March this year. This virus acquired the ability for sustained human to human spread and within a few months spread throughout the world and infected over 4 lakh individuals. The symptoms of infection with this virus are similar to seasonal influenza but it currently affecting younger individuals more often. Fortunately the mortality has been low.

1597,1597,1597,A systematic review of studies on forecasting the dynamics of influenza outbreaks,12.651835,8.365847,2013-12-23,"Forecasting the dynamics of influenza outbreaks could be useful for decision-making regarding the allocation of public health resources. Reliable forecasts could also aid in the selection and implementation of interventions to reduce morbidity and mortality due to influenza illness. This paper reviews methods for influenza forecasting proposed during previous influenza outbreaks and those evaluated in hindsight. We discuss the various approaches, in addition to the variability in measures of accuracy and precision of predicted measures. PubMed and Google Scholar searches for articles on influenza forecasting retrieved sixteen studies that matched the study criteria. We focused on studies that aimed at forecasting influenza outbreaks at the local, regional, national, or global level. The selected studies spanned a wide range of regions including USA, Sweden, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, United Kingdom, Canada, France, and Cuba. The methods were also applied to forecast a single measure or multiple measures. Typical measures predicted included peak timing, peak height, daily/weekly case counts, and outbreak magnitude. Due to differences in measures used to assess accuracy, a single estimate of predictive error for each of the measures was difficult to obtain. However, collectively, the results suggest that these diverse approaches to influenza forecasting are capable of capturing specific outbreak measures with some degree of accuracy given reliable data and correct disease assumptions. Nonetheless, several of these approaches need to be evaluated and their performance quantified in real-time predictions.","Nsoesie, Elaine O; Brownstein, John S; Ramakrishnan, Naren; Marathe, Madhav V",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,102,27

In patients with “HCV-associated mixed cryoglobulinemia” (MC + HCV), a higher prevalence of thyroid autoimmune disorders was shown not only compared to controls, but also versus HCV patients without cryoglobulinemia. Patients with MC + HCV or HCV chronic infection show a higher prevalence of papillary thyroid cancer than controls, in particular in patients with autoimmune thyroiditis. Patients with HCV chronic infection, or with MC + HCV, in presence of autoimmune thyroiditis, show higher serum levels of T-helper (Th)1 (C-X-C motif) ligand 10 (CXCL10) chemokine, but normal levels of Th2 (C-C motif) ligand 2 chemokine, than patients without thyroiditis. HCV thyroid infection could act by upregulating CXCL10 gene expression and secretion in thyrocytes recruiting Th1 lymphocytes that secrete interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α. These cytokines might induce a further CXCL10 secretion by thyrocytes, thus perpetuating the immune cascade, which may lead to the appearance of autoimmune thyroid disorders in genetically predisposed subjects. A careful monitoring of thyroid function, particularly where nodules occur, is recommended in HCV patients.","Fallahi, Poupak; Ferrari, Silvia Martina; Politti, Ugo; Giuggioli, Dilia; Ferri, Clodoveo; Antonelli, Alessandro",Int J Endocrinol,102,1

F4/AS01 consists of F4 recombinant fusion protein (containing clade B Gag/p24, Pol/RT, Nef and Gag/p17) formulated in AS01 Adjuvant System, and was shown to induce F4-specific polyfunctional CD4(+) T-cell responses in humans. While replication-incompetent recombinant HIV-1/SIV antigen-expressing human adenoviral vectors can elicit high-frequency antigen-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses, their use is hampered by widespread pre-existing immunity to human serotypes. Non-human adenovirus serotypes associated with lower prevalence may offer an alternative strategy. We evaluated the immunogenicity of AdC7-GRN (‘A’), a recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus type 7 vector expressing clade B Gag, RT and Nef, and F4/AS01 (‘P’), when delivered intramuscularly in homologous (PP or AA) and heterologous (AAPP or PPAA) prime-boost regimens, in macaques and mice. Vaccine-induced HIV-1-antigen-specific T cells in peripheral blood (macaques), liver, spleen, and intestinal and genital mucosa (mice) were characterized by intracellular cytokine staining. Vaccine-specific IgG antibodies (macaques) were detected using ELISA. In macaques, only the heterologous prime-boost regimens induced polyfunctional, persistent and balanced CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell responses specific to each HIV-1 vaccine antigen. AdC7-GRN priming increased the polyfunctionality of F4/AS01-induced CD4(+) T cells. Approximately 50% of AdC7-GRN-induced memory CD8(+) T cells exhibited an effector-memory phenotype. HIV-1-specific antibodies were detected with each regimen. In mice, antigen-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell responses were detected in the mucosal and systemic anatomical compartments assessed. When administered in heterologous prime-boost regimens, AdC7-GRN and F4/AS01 candidate vaccines acted complementarily in inducing potent and persistent peripheral blood HIV-1-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell responses and antibodies in macaques. Besides, adenoviral vector priming modulated the cytokine-expression profile of the protein-induced CD4(+) T cells. Each regimen induced HIV-1-specific T-cell responses in systemic/local tissues in mice. This suggests that prime-boost regimens combining adjuvanted protein and low-seroprevalent chimpanzee adenoviral vectors represent an attractive vaccination strategy for clinical evaluation.","Lorin, Clarisse; Vanloubbeeck, Yannick; Baudart, Sébastien; Ska, Michaël; Bayat, Babak; Brauers, Geoffroy; Clarinval, Géraldine; Donner, Marie-Noëlle; Marchand, Martine; Koutsoukos, Marguerite; Mettens, Pascal; Cohen, Joe; Voss, Gerald",PLoS One,102,8
1834,1834,1834,Detection of Acute HIV-1 Infection by RT-LAMP,12.428081,8.413307,2015-05-20,"A rapid, cost-effective diagnostic test for the detection of acute HIV-1 infection is highly desired. Isothermal amplification techniques, such as reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), exhibit characteristics that are ideal for the development of a rapid nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) because they are quick, easy to perform and do not require complex, dedicated equipment and laboratory space. In this study, we assessed the ability of the HIV-1 RT-LAMP assay to detect acute HIV infection as compared to a representative rapid antibody test and several FDA-approved laboratory-based assays. The HIV-1 RT-LAMP assay detected seroconverting individuals one to three weeks earlier than a rapid HIV antibody test and up to two weeks earlier than a lab-based antigen/antibody (Ag/Ab) combo enzyme immunoassay (EIA). RT-LAMP was not as sensitive as a lab-based qualitative RNA assay, which could be attributed to the significantly smaller nucleic acid input volume. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of detecting acute HIV infection using the RT-LAMP assay. The availability of a rapid NAAT, such as the HIV-1 RT-LAMP assay, at the point of care (POC) or in laboratories that do not have access to large platform NAAT could increase the percentage of individuals who receive an acute HIV infection status or confirmation of their HIV status, while immediately linking them to counseling and medical care. In addition, early knowledge of HIV status could lead to reduced high-risk behavior at a time when individuals are at a higher risk for transmitting the virus.","Rudolph, Donna L.; Sullivan, Vickie; Owen, S.

1840,1840,1840,Influenza induces IL-8 and GM-CSF secretion by human alveolar epithelial cells through HGF/c-Met and TGF-α/EGFR signaling,12.580208,8.540404,2015-04-10,"The most severe complication of influenza is viral pneumonia, which can lead to the acute respiratory distress syndrome. Alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) are the first cells that influenza virus encounters upon entering the alveolus. Infected epithelial cells produce cytokines that attract and activate neutrophils and macrophages, which in turn induce damage to the epithelial-endothelial barrier. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/c-Met and transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α)/epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are well known to regulate repair of damaged alveolar epithelium by stimulating cell migration and proliferation. Recently, TGF-α/EGFR signaling has also been shown to regulate innate immune responses in bronchial epithelial cells. However, little is known about whether HGF/c-Met signaling alters the innate immune responses and whether the innate immune responses in AECs are regulated by HGF/c-Met and TGF-α/EGFR. We hypothesized that HGF/c-Met and TGF-α/EGFR would regulate innate immune responses to influenza A virus infection in human AECs. We found that recombinant human HGF (rhHGF) and rhTGF-α stimulated primary human AECs to secrete IL-8 and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) strongly and IL-6 and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 moderately. Influenza infection stimulated the secretion of IL-8 and GM-CSF by AECs plated on rat-tail collagen through EGFR activation likely by TGF-α released from AECs and through c-Met activated by HGF secreted from lung fibroblasts.

1889,1889,1889,Nogo-B protects mice against lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury,12.697609,8.4779415,2015-07-15,"Nogo-B, a member of the reticulon 4 protein family, plays a critical role in tissue repair and acute inflammation. Its role in acute lung injury (ALI) remains unclear. Here, we assessed the function of Nogo-B during tissue injury in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI mouse model. We found that pulmonary Nogo-B was significantly repressed after LPS instillation in C57BL/6 mice. Over-expression of pulmonary Nogo-B using an adenovirus vector carrying the Nogo-B-RFP-3flag gene (Ad-Nogo-B) significantly prolonged the survival of mice challenged with a lethal dose of LPS. The Ad-Nogo-B-treated mice also had less severe lung injury, less alveolar protein exudation, and a higher number of macrophages but less neutrophil infiltration compared with Ad-RFP-treated mice. Interestingly, microarray analysis showed that the Ad-Nogo-B-treated mice had different gene expression profiles compared with the controls and the prominent expression of genes related to wound healing and the humoral immune response after LPS induction. Of the 49 differently expressed genes, we found that the expression of PTX3 was significantly up-regulated following Nogo-B over-expression as observed in lung tissues and RAW264.7 cells. In conclusion, Nogo-B plays a protective role against LPS-induced ALI, and this effect might be exerted through the modulation of alveolar macrophage recruitment and PTX3 production.","Xu, Wujian; Zhu, Ying; Ning, Yunye; Dong, Yuchao; Huang, Haidong; Zhang, Wei; Sun, Qinying; Li, Qiang",Sci Rep,102,1

The role of mathematical models in influenza pandemic preparedness planning,12.629961,8.44915,2007-05-25,"The panzootic of H5N1 influenza in birds has raised concerns that the virus will mutate to spread more readily in people, leading to a human pandemic. Mathematical models have been used to interpret past pandemics and outbreaks, and to thus model possible future pandemic scenarios and interventions. We review historical influenza outbreak and transmission data, and discuss the way in which modellers have used such sources to inform model structure and assumptions. We suggest that urban attack rates in the 1918–1919 pandemic were constrained by prior immunity, that R (0) for influenza is higher than often assumed, and that control of any future pandemic could be difficult in the absence of significant prior immunity. In future, modelling assumptions, parameter estimates and conclusions should be tested against as many relevant data sets as possible. To this end, we encourage researchers to access FluWeb, an on‐line influenza database of historical pandemics and outbreaks.","McVernon, J; McCaw, CT; Mathews, JD",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,102,22
2139,2139,2139,Protective effects of fenofibrate against acute lung injury induced by intestinal ischemia/reperfusion in mice,12.678197,8.413931,2016-02-23,"This experiment was conducted to evaluate whether pretreatment with fenofibrate could mitigate acute lung injury (ALI) in a mice model of intestinal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). Male C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned into three groups (n = 6): sham, intestinal I/R + vehicle, and intestinal I/R + fenofibrate. Intestinal I/R was achieved by clamping the superior mesenteric artery. Fenofibrate (100 mg/kg) or equal volume of vehicle was injected intraperitoneally 60 minutes before the ischemia. At the end of experiment, measurement of pathohistological score, inflammatory mediators and other markers were performed. In addition, a 24-hour survival experiment was conducted in intestinal I/R mice treated with fenofibrate or vehicle. The chief results were as anticipated. Pathohistological evaluation indicated that fenofibrate ameliorated the local intestine damage and distant lung injury. Pretreatment with fenofibrate significantly decreased inflammatory factors in both the intestine and the lung. Consistently, renal creatine levels and hepatic ALT levels were significantly decreased in the fenofibrate group. Moreover, serum systemic inflammatory response indicators were significantly alleviated in the fenofibrate group. In addition, fenofibrate administration significantly improved the survival rate. Collectively, our data indicated that pretreatment with fenofibrate prior to ischemia attenuated intestinal I/R injury and ALI.","Zhu, Qiankun; He, Guizhen; Wang, Jie; Wang, Yukang; Chen, Wei",Sci Rep,102,1
2475,2475,2475,Interferon lambda 4 expression is suppressed by the host during viral infection,12.603711,8.306277,2016-11-14,"Interferon (IFN) lambdas are critical antiviral effectors in hepatic and mucosal infections. Although IFNλ1, IFNλ2, and IFNλ3 act antiviral, genetic association studies have shown that expression of the recently discovered IFNL4 is detrimental to hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection through a yet unknown mechanism. Intriguingly, human IFNL4 harbors a genetic variant that introduces a premature stop codon. We performed a molecular and biochemical characterization of IFNλ4 to determine its role and regulation of expression. We found that IFNλ4 exhibits similar antiviral activity to IFNλ3 without negatively affecting antiviral IFN activity or cell survival. We show that humans deploy several mechanisms to limit expression of functional IFNλ4 through noncoding splice variants and nonfunctional protein isoforms. Furthermore, protein-coding IFNL4 mRNA are not loaded onto polyribosomes and lack a strong polyadenylation signal, resulting in poor translation efficiency. This study provides mechanistic evidence that humans suppress IFNλ4 expression, suggesting that immune function is dependent on other IFNL family members.","Hong, MeeAe; Schwerk, Johannes; Lim, Chrissie; Kell, Alison; Jarret, Abigail; Pangallo, Joseph; Loo, Yueh-Ming; Liu, Shuanghu; Hagedorn, Curt H.; Gale, Michael; Savan, Ram",J Exp Med,102,22
2557,2557,2557,Alternative Polyadenylation of Human Bocavirus at Its 3′ End Is Regulated by Multiple Elements and Affects Capsid Expression,12.459679,8.367427,2017-01-18,"Alternative processing of human bocavirus (HBoV) P5 promoter-transcribed RNA is critical for generating the structural and nonstructural protein-encoding mRNA transcripts. The regulatory mechanism by which HBoV RNA transcripts are polyadenylated at proximal [(pA)p] or distal [(pA)d] polyadenylation sites is still unclear. We constructed a recombinant HBoV infectious clone to study the alternative polyadenylation regulation of HBoV. Surprisingly, in addition to the reported distal polyadenylation site, (pA)d, a novel distal polyadenylation site, (pA)d2, which is located in the right-end hairpin (REH), was identified during infectious clone transfection or recombinant virus infection. (pA)d2 does not contain typical hexanucleotide polyadenylation signal, upstream elements (USE), or downstream elements (DSE) according to sequence analysis. Further study showed that HBoV nonstructural protein NS1, REH, and cis elements of (pA)d were necessary and sufficient for efficient polyadenylation at (pA)d2. The distance and sequences between (pA)d and (pA)d2 also played a key role in the regulation of polyadenylation at (pA)d2. Finally, we demonstrated that efficient polyadenylation at (pA)d2 resulted in increased HBoV capsid mRNA transcripts and protein translation. Thus, our study revealed that all the bocaviruses have distal poly(A) signals on the right-end palindromic terminus, and alternative polyadenylation at the HBoV 3′ end regulates its capsid expression. IMPORTANCE The distal polyadenylation site, (pA)d, of HBoV is located about 400 nucleotides (nt) from the right-end palindromic terminus, which is different from those of bovine parvovirus (BPV) and canine minute virus (MVC) in the same genus whose distal polyadenylation is located in the right-end stem-loop structure. A novel polyadenylation site, (pA)d2, was identified in the right-end hairpin of HBoV during infectious clone transfection or recombinant virus infection. Sequence analysis showed that (pA)d2 does not contain typical polyadenylation signals, and the last 42 nt form a stem-loop structure which is almost identical to that of MVC. Further study showed that NS1, REH, and cis elements of (pA)d are required for efficient polyadenylation at (pA)d2. Polyadenylation at (pA)d2 enhances capsid expression. Our study demonstrates alternative polyadenylation at the 3′ end of HBoV and suggests an additional mechanism by which capsid expression is regulated.","Hao, Sujuan; Zhang, Junmei; Chen, Zhen; Xu, Huanzhou; Wang, Hanzhong; Guan, Wuxiang",J Virol,102,11

Despite extensive studies of the signaling pathways that mediate LPA-regulated cell growth and survival, the mechanisms underlying the apoptotic effect of LPA remain largely unclear. In this study, we investigated this issue in HeLa cells. Our data demonstrate that LPA induces apoptosis in HeLa cells at pathologic concentrations with a concomitant upregulation of the expression of TNFRSF21 (tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 21), also known as death receptor number 6 (DR6) involved in inflammation. Moreover, treatment of cells with LPA receptor (LPAR) antagonist abolished the DR6 upregulation by LPA. LPA-induced DR6 expression was also abrogated by pertussis toxin (PTX), an inhibitor of GPCRs, and by inhibitors of PI3K, PKC, MEK, and ERK. Intriguingly, LPA-induced DR6 expression was specifically blocked by dominant-negative form of PKCδ (PKCδ-DN). LPA-induced DR6 expression was also dramatically inhibited by knockdown of ERK or CREB. These results suggest that activation of the MEK/ERK pathway and the transcription factor CREB mediate LPA-induced DR6 expression. More interestingly, knockdown of DR6 using siRNA approach remarkably attenuated LPA-induced apoptosis. In conclusion, our results suggest that LPA-induced apoptosis in HeLa cells is mediated by the upregulation of DR6 expression.","Dong, Yunzhou; Wu, Yong; Cui, Mei-Zhen; Xu, Xuemin",Mediators Inflamm,102,1

This is considered as the method of choice for generating lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). Producing LCLs, although very useful but is very time consuming and troublesome, drives the requirement for quicker and more reliable methods for EBV-driven B-cell transformation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After successfully production of LCLs, different parameters including temperature, serum concentration, type of culture medium, and CO(2) concentration were evaluated on EBV-transformed B-cells. In this study, we were able to produce LCLs and optimize condition. RESULTS: The best condition for generating LCLs was 37°C, 5% CO(2), 20% fasting blood sugar, and RPMI 1640. The study results were to establish a reliable method for producing LCLs that can be used to produce immortalized B-cells from almost any sources.

Immunocompromised patients, healthcare workers (HCWs) and children contacts are at increased risk of acquiring the infection. However, the impact of asymptomatic infection in transmission has not been well studied. Objectives: this study evaluated the frequency and viral load (VL) of RSV in nasal swab samples of individuals with different risk factors for acquiring infection in a university hospital in Sao Paulo, Brazil. METHODS: We included 196 symptomatic children and their 192 asymptomatic caregivers, 70 symptomatic and 95 asymptomatic HCWs, 43 samples from symptomatic HIV‐positive outpatients, and 100 samples of asymptomatic HIV patients in the period of 2009‐2013. RESULTS: RSV infection was detected in 10.1% (70/696) of samples, 4.4% (17/387) of asymptomatic patients, and 17.1% (53/309) from symptomatic patients. (P < .0001). The VL of symptomatic patients (4.7 log copies/mL) was significantly higher compared to asymptomatic patients (2.3 log copies/mL). RSV detection among asymptomatic caregivers (6.8%; 13/192) was significantly higher compared to other asymptomatic adults, HIV and HCWs (2.0%; 4/195; P = .0252). A close contact with an infected child at home was an important risk to RSV acquisition [OR 22.6 (95% CI 4.8‐106.7)]. Children who possibly transmitted the virus to their asymptomatic contacts had significantly higher viral load than children who probably did not transmit (P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: According to our results, it is important to know if people circulating inside the hospital have close contact with acute respiratory infected children.","Moreira, Luciana Peniche; Watanabe, Aripuana Sakurada Aranha; Camargo, Clarice Neves; Melchior, Thais Boim; Granato, Celso; Bellei, Nancy",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,102,28

Codon usage bias not only plays an important regulatory role at the level of gene expression, but also helps in improving the accuracy and efficiency of translation. Meanwhile, codon usage pattern of Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome is important for interpreting evolutionary characteristics in species. In order to investigate the codon usage pattern of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome, 12 Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes from different area are downloaded from the GeneBank. The correlations between G(3), GC(12), whole GC content, codon adaptation index, codon bias index, and so on of Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes are calculated. The ENC-plot, relationship between A(3)/(A(3) + T(3)) and G(3)/(G(3) + C(3)), GC(12) versus GC(3) plot, and the RSCU of overall/separated genomes all show that the codon usage bias exists in all 12 Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes. Lastly, relationship between CBI and the equalization of ENC shows a strong negative correlation between them. The relationship between protein length and GC content (GC(3) and GC(12)) shows that more obvious differences in the GC content may be in shorter protein. These results show that codon usage bias existing in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes could be used for further study on their evolutionary phenomenon.","Gun, Li; Yumiao, Ren; Haixian, Pan; Liang, Zhang",Biomed Res Int,102,1

This observational study examined the association of temperature, humidity and rainfall with six common climate-sensitive infectious diseases in adults (malaria, diarrheal disease, enteric fever, encephalitis, pneumonia and bacterial meningitis) in northeastern Bangladesh. Subjects admitted to the adult medicine ward of a tertiary referral hospital in Sylhet, Bangladesh from 2008 to 2012 with a diagnosis of one of the six chosen climate-sensitive infectious diseases were enrolled in the study. Climate-related data were collected from the Bangladesh Meteorological Institute. Disease incidence was then analyzed against mean temperature, humidity and average rainfall for the Sylhet region. Statistical significance was determined using Mann-Whitney test, Chi-square test and ANOVA testing. 5033 patients were enrolled (58% male, 42% female, ratio 1.3:1). All six diseases showed highly significant (p = 0.01) rises in incidence between the study years 2008 (540 cases) and 2012 (1330 cases), compared with no significant rise in overall all-cause hospital admissions in the same period (p = 0.19). The highest number of malaria (135), diarrhea (266) and pneumonia (371) cases occurred during the rainy season. On the other hand, the maximum number of enteric fever (408), encephalitis (183) and meningitis (151) cases occurred during autumn, which follows the rainy season. A positive (P = 0.01) correlation was observed between increased temperature and the incidence of malaria, enteric fever and diarrhea, and a negative correlation with encephalitis, meningitis and pneumonia. Higher humidity correlated (P = 0.01) with a higher number of cases of malaria and diarrhea, but inversely correlated with meningitis and encephalitis. Higher incidences of encephalitis and meningitis occurred while there was low rainfall. Incidences of diarrhea, malaria and enteric fever, increased with rainfall, and then gradually decreased.

Mouse B-1a cells are a phenotypically and functionally unique sub-population of B cells, providing immediate protection against infection by releasing natural antibodies and immunomodulatory molecules. We hypothesize that B-1a cells ameliorate sepsis-induced ALI. METHODS: Sepsis was induced in C57BL/6 mice by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). PBS or B-1a cells were adoptively transferred into the septic mice intraperitoneally. After 20 h of CLP, lungs were harvested and assessed by PCR and ELISA for pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1β) and chemokine (MIP-2) expression, by histology for injury, by TUNEL and cleaved caspase-3 for apoptosis, and by myeloperoxidase (MPO) assay for neutrophil infiltration. RESULTS: We found that septic mice adoptively transferred with B-1a cells significantly decreased the mRNA and protein levels of IL-6, IL-1β and MIP-2 in the lungs compared to PBS-treated mice. Mice treated with B-1a cells showed dramatic improvement in lung injury compared to PBS-treated mice after sepsis. We found apoptosis in the lungs was significantly inhibited in B-1a cell injected mice compared to PBS-treated mice after sepsis. B-1a cell treatment significantly down-regulated MPO levels in the lungs compared to PBS-treated mice in sepsis. The protective outcomes of B-1a cells in ALI was further confirmed by using B-1a cell deficient CD19(−/−) mice, which showed significant increase in the lung injury scores following sepsis as compared to WT mice.

Although the delivery of CpG ODNs in ovo at embryo day (ED) 18 has been shown to reduce infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) loads in embryonic chicken lungs pre-hatch, whether in ovo delivered CpG ODNs are capable of protecting chickens against a post-hatch challenge is unknown. Thus, our objectives were to determine the protective effect of the in ovo delivery of CpG ODNs at ED 18 against IBV infection encountered post-hatch and, then, to investigate the mechanisms of protection. We found significantly higher survival rates and reduced IBV infection in the chickens following the pre-treatment of the ED 18 eggs with CpG ODNs. At 3 days post infection (dpi), we found an increased recruitment of macrophages, cluster of differentiation (CD)8α+ and CD4+ T lymphocytes, and an up-regulation of interferon (IFN)-γ mRNA in the respiratory tract of the chickens.

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients aged less than 15 years with laboratory-confirmed RSV infections and seizures between January 2011 and December 2016 in a regional hospital in South Korea. RESULTS: During this period, 1,193 patients with laboratory-confirmed RSV infection were identified. Of these, 35 (35 of 1,193, 2.93%; boys, 19; girls, 16; mean age: 20.8±16.6 months) presented with seizure. Febrile seizure was the most common diagnosis (27 of 35, 77.1%); simple febrile seizures in 13 patients (13 of 27, 48.1%) and complex febrile seizures in 14 (14 of 27, 51.9%).

Lower respiratory symptoms were not observed in 8 patients. In a patient with encephalopathy, brain diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging revealed transient changes in white matter, suggesting cytotoxic edema as the mechanism underlying encephalopathy. Most patients recovered with general management, and progression to epilepsy was noted in only 1 patient. CONCLUSION: Although febrile seizures are the most common type of seizure associated with RSV infection, the proportion of patients with complex febrile seizures was higher than that of those with general febrile seizures. Transient cytotoxic edema may be a pathogenic mechanism in RSV-related encephalopathy with seizures.","Cha, Teahyen; Choi, Young Jin; Oh, Jae-Won; Kim, Chang-Ryul; Park, Dong Woo; Seol, In Joon; Moon, Jin-Hwa",Korean J Pediatr,102,28

Antimicrobial peptides exert various mechanisms such as changing cell membrane permeability which leads to inhibition or death of bacterial cells. mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are key to produce antimicrobial peptides and to inhibit the growth of pathogens. These cells have been shown to be capable of producing antimicrobial peptides upon exposure to different bacteria. As a result, antimicrobial peptides can be considered as novel agents for the treatment of infectious diseases. The purpose of this review was to investigate the targets and mechanisms of antimicrobial peptides secreted by MSCs.","Esfandiyari, Reza; Halabian, Raheleh; Behzadi, Elham; Sedighian, Hamid; Jafari, Ramezan; Imani Fooladi, Abbas Ali",Heliyon,102,1

Twenty-nine patients who achieved complete remission (CR) were assigned to receive autologous SCT (autoSCT) or allogeneic SCT (alloSCT) based on age and availability of a histocompatible sibling. Of the 19 patients assigned to autoSCT, 10 did not reach the transplant due to early relapse (n = 9) or fungal infection (n = 1), and nine were transplanted a median of 2.5 months (1–8) from CR, eight with an immunologically purged graft. One patient died early from ARDS and eight relapsed 2–30 months post-SCT. Three of the 10 patients assigned to alloSCT relapsed early, but all 10 received the assigned transplant a median of 2.5 months (1–7) from CR. Four died from transplant-related complications 0.7–12 months post- SCT, and six are alive and disease-free 9.7–92.6 months after the procedure. In an intention-to-treat analysis, the mean overall survival from CR for those assigned to autoSCT and alloSCT are 11.3 months (0.5–34.3) and 60.1 (2.3–98.3), respectively (log-rank, P < 0.01). only 65% of patients who reached cr and 51% of the initial 37 cases underwent the intended sct. we conclude that few adults with refractory or relapsed all actually reach sct in cr even when the protocol used is designed for this purpose. autosct appears to offer little benefit in this setting, and an allosct from a related or unrelated donor should be rapidly pursued after achieving cr.","Martino, R; Bellido, M; Brunet, S; Sureda, A; Peyret, M; Guárdia, R; Altés, A; Domingo-Albós, A; Sierra, J",Bone Marrow Transplant,102,1

Outcome analysis of 206 SOT recipients following HCT challenges the validity of the frequently stated comparable outcome with recipients without prior HCT. SOT recipients after HCT are younger and have a higher mortality and morbidity in comparison with “standard” recipients. Rejection rates for SOT recipients following HCT appear to be lower for all organs, except for liver transplantation. In the setting of liver transplantation following HCT, mortality for recipients of deceased donor grafts appears to be exceptionally high, although experience with grafts of living donors are favourable. Morbidity was mostly associated with infectious and malignant complications. Of note some SOT recipients who received solid organ donation from the same HCT donor were able to achieve successful withdrawal of immune suppression.

METHODS: This prospective study compared clinical presentation, outcomes, microbial etiology, and treatment of HCAP, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and immunocompromised patients (ICP) with severe pneumonia admitted to 34 Spanish ICUs. RESULTS: A total of 726 patients with pneumonia (449 CAP, 133 HCAP, and 144 ICP) were recruited during 1 year from April 2011. HCAP patients had more comorbidities and worse clinical status (Barthel score). HCAP and ICP patients needed mechanical ventilation and tracheotomy more frequently than CAP patients. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most frequent pathogen in all three groups (CAP, 34.2 %; HCAP, 19.5 %; ICP, 23.4 %; p = 0.001). The overall incidence of Gram-negative pathogens, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was low, but higher in HCAP and ICP patients than CAP. Empirical treatment was in line with CAP guidelines in 73.5 % of patients with CAP, in 45.5 % of those with HCAP, and in 40 % of those with ICP. The incidence of inappropriate empirical antibiotic therapy was 6.5 % in CAP, 14.4 % in HCAP, and 21.8 % in ICP (p < 0.001). Mortality was highest in ICP (38.6 %) and did not differ between CAP (18.4 %) and HCAP (21.2 %). CONCLUSIONS: HCAP accounts for one-fifth of cases of severe pneumonia in patients admitted to Spanish ICUs. The empirical antibiotic therapy recommended for CAP would be appropriate for 90 % of patients with HCAP in our population, and consequently the decision to include coverage of multidrug-resistant pathogens for HCAP should be cautiously judged in order to prevent the overuse of antimicrobials.

The cellular and molecular mechanisms leading to the development of ALI/ARDS are not completely understood, but there is evidence that reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by inflammatory cells as well as epithelial and endothelial cells are responsible for inflammatory response, lung damage, and abnormal repair. Among all ROS-producing enzymes, the members of NADPH oxidases (NOXs), which are widely expressed in different lung cell types, have been shown to participate in cellular processes involved in the maintenance of lung integrity. It is not surprising that change in NOXs’ expression and function is involved in the development of ALI/ARDS. In this context, the use of NOX inhibitors could be a possible therapeutic perspective in the management of this syndrome. In this article, we summarize the current knowledge concerning some cellular aspects of NOXs localization and function in the lungs, consider their contribution in the development of ALI/ARDS and discuss the place of NOX inhibitors as potential therapeutical target.","Carnesecchi, Stéphanie; Pache, Jean-Claude; Barazzone-Argiroffo, Constance",Cell Mol Life Sci,102,1

Despite recent progress in understanding the immune conditions of abdominal sepsis, the postoperative incidence of septic complications after major visceral surgery remains high. This review focuses on the clinical and immunological parameters that determine the risk of the development and lethal outcome of postoperative septic complication following major surgery and trauma. A review of the literature indicates that surgical and traumatic injury profoundly affects the innate and adaptive immune responses, and that a marked suppression in cell-mediated immunity following an excessive inflammatory response appears to be responsible for the increased susceptibility to subsequent sepsis. The innate and adaptive immune responses are initiated and modulated by pathogen-associated molecular-pattern molecules and by damage-associated molecular-pattern molecules through the pattern-recognition receptors. Suppression of cell-mediated immunity may be caused by multifaceted cytokine/inhibitor profiles in the circulation and other compartments of the host, excessive activation and dysregulated recruitment of polymorphonuclear neutrophils, induction of alternatively activated or regulatory macrophages that have anti-inflammatory properties, a shift in the T-helper (Th)1/Th2 balance toward Th2, appearance of regulatory T cells, which are potent suppressors of the innate and adaptive immune system, and lymphocyte apoptosis in patients with sepsis. Recent basic and clinical studies have elucidated the functional effects of surgical and traumatic injury on the immune system. The research studies of interest may in future aid in the selection of appropriate therapeutic protocols.","Kimura, Fumio; Shimizu, Hiroaki; Yoshidome, Hiroyuki; Ohtsuka, Masayuki; Miyazaki, Masaru",Surg Today,102,1

But the association between the level of DC-SIGNR and lung cancer is unknown. To investigate the clinical diagnostic significance of DC-SIGNR in lung cancer, we investigated serum DC-SIGNR levels in 173 lung cancer patients and 134 healthy individuals using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results showed that serum DC-SIGNR levels in lung cancer patients were lower than that in healthy controls (P = 0.0003). A cut-off value of 3.8998 ng/L for DC-SIGNR predicted the presence of lung cancer with 78.03 % sensitivity and 49.25 % specificity (area under the curve = 0.6212, P = 0.0003). Strikingly, serum DC-SIGNR levels were significantly higher in lung cancer patients with brain metastasis compared to those without metastasis (P = 0.0283). Moreover, the serum concentrations of DC-SIGNR in lung cancer patients also correlated significantly with serum natural killer cells percentage (P = 0.0017). In addition, immunohistochemistry assay demonstrated that the expression of DC-SIGNR in lung tissues of 31 lung cancer patients and 13 tuberculosis patients was significantly lower than that in 18 normal lung tissues (P = 0.0418, 0.0289), and there is no significant difference between tuberculosis tissues and lung cancer tissues (P = 0.2696). These results suggest that DC-SIGNR maybe a promising biological molecule that has the potential for clinical research of lung cancer, whereas its underlying roles are needed to be investigated in further studies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty adult patients (nine women and 11 men; mean age 43.5±16.4 years) with a diagnosis of H1N1 infection confirmed by pharyngeal swab came to our attention from September to November 2009 and were followed up until September 2010. All patients were hospitalised in consideration of the severity of clinical findings, and all underwent chest X-ray. Twelve of them underwent at least one computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest. RESULTS: In 75% of cases (15/20), there was complete resolution of the clinical and radiological findings. Twenty-five percent of patients (5/20) developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which progressed to predominantly peripheral pulmonary fibrosis in 10% (2/20; one died and one had late-onset pulmonary fibrosis, documented on day 68). Moreover, in one patient with a CT diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis, we observed progressive regression of radiological findings over 4 months of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with H1N1 pneumonia, post-ARDS pulmonary fibrosis is not a rare complication. Therefore, a CT scan should be performed in all patients with severe clinical findings. Our study demonstrated that in these patients, fibrosis could present a different spatial distribution and a different temporal trend, with delayed late onset; moreover, in one case, the signs of interstitial lung disease partially regressed over time. Therefore, CT should be considered not only in the diagnostic stage, but also during the follow-up.","Mineo, G.; Ciccarese, F.; Modolon, C.; Landini, M.

Recently, it has been reported that topoisomerases play a key role in DNA repair, suggesting an additional regulatory mechanism of the chromosome structure on DNA metabolism and cell cycle checkpoints. Despite the progress made toward the understanding of the genome organization and expression, few changes have been reported in the chromosome scaffold of malignant cells associated with the cancer phenotype. In a previous work, we reported LFM-1 protein (Licensing Factor Model-1) as a chromosomal-scaffold component transiently associated with mitotic chromosomes in MDCK (Madin Darby canine kidney) epithelial cells (Vega-Salas and Salas 1996). In this work, we explore LFM-1 expression in human epithelia with contrasting tumorigenicity during the progression of the cell cycle. Although cell metabolic labeling shows synthesis of a common 87-kDa LFM-1 precursor during G(2)-phase in both non-tumorigenic and cancer cells, surprisingly, the post-translational LFM-1 chromosome-bound polypeptide displays a different apparent molecular weight and binding to chromosomes in the cancer phenotype. The finding of a highly phosphorylated LFM-1 60-kDa form with abnormal binding to chromosomes in human carcinoma cells suggests a structural/regulatory role(s) of the chromosome-scaffold/matrix in DNA metabolism in cancer-related events of cell proliferation.","Vega-Salas, Dora E.; Fernandez, Manuel; Nouri, Keyvan",Cell Tissue Res,102,8

Results: The detection limit was 31.9 IU of HIV-1 RNA/mL of plasma (>95% probability of detection, Probit analysis). The internal control showed inhibition in 3.7% of samples (95% confidence interval, 2.32%–5.9%; n = 454; 40 different runs). Comparative qualitative testing yielded the following: Roche Amplicor vs LTR assay (n = 431 samples), 51.7% vs 65% positives; Amplicor Ultrasensitive vs LTR (n = 133), 81.2% vs 82.7%; BioMerieux NucliSens HIV-1 QT (n = 453), 60.5% vs 65.1%; Bayer Versant 3.0 (n = 433), 57.7% vs 55.4%; total (n = 1450), 59.0% vs 63.8% positives. Intra-/interassay variability at medium and near-negative concentrations was 18%–51%. The quantification range was 50–10 000 000 IU/mL. Viral loads for subtypes A–D, F–J, AE, and AG yielded mean differences of 0.31 log(10) compared with Amplicor in the 10(3)–10(4) IU/mL range. HIV-1 N and O were not detected by Amplicor, but yielded up to 180 180.00 IU/mL in the LTR assay. Viral loads in stored samples from all countries, compared with Amplicor, NucliSens, or Versant, yielded regression line slopes (SD) of 0.9 (0.13) (P <0.001 for all).

Acute gastroenteritis is among the most common illnesses of humans and is caused by a variety of agents, including bacteria, viruses, parasites, toxins, and chemicals. The clinical spectrum ranges from asymptomatic or mild infection to severe dehydrating illness with a fatal outcome; the latter occurs primarily in young children and in the elderly. The chapter concludes with a discussion on the prevention and treatment of gastroenteritis. For the prevention of epidemic viral gastroenteritis, efforts need to be focused on caliciviruses. No specific antiviral therapy is recommended for childhood viral gastroenteritis, emphasizing the importance of distinguishing it from the selected forms of bacterial and parasitic gastroenteritis that require treatment.

By means of a monoclonal immunoradiometric assay for calcitonin precursors, we have measured serum concentrations of procalcitonin in patients with various bacterial and viral infections. 79 children (newborn to age 12 years) in hospital with suspected infections were investigated prospectively. 19 patients with severe bacterial infections had very high serum concentrations of procalcitonin at diagnosis (range 6-53 ng/mL) in comparison with 21 children found to have no signs of infection (baseline concentrations <0·1 ng/mL). Serum procalcitonin values decreased rapidly during antibiotic therapy. 11 patients with peripheral bacterial colonisation or local infections without invasive sepsis and 18 (86%) of 21 patients with viral infections had concentrations within or slightly above the normal range (0·1-1·5 ng/mL). Among 9 severely burned patients studied in an intensive care unit, the post-traumatic course of procalcitonin concentrations (range 0·1-120 ng/mL) was closely related to infectious complications and acute septic episodes. Concentrations of mature calcitonin were normal in all subjects, whatever procalcitonin concentrations were found. Concentrations of a substance immunologically identical to procalcitonin are raised during septic conditions.

Organizational systems to protect against HAI in hospitals in Australia are relatively poorly developed. Awareness and practice of infection control by medical and other healthcare staff are often poor. These lapses in practice create significant risk for patients and staff from HAI. Excessive patient exposure to antimicrobials is another key factor in the emergence of antibiotic‐resistant bacteria and Clostridium difficile infection. Physicians must ensure that their interactions with patients are safe from the infection prevention standpoint. The critical preventative practice is hand hygiene in accord with the World Health Organization 5 moments model. Improving the use of antimicrobials, asepsis and immunization also has great importance. Hospitals should measure and feed back HAI rates to clinical teams. Physicians as leaders, role models and educators play an important part in promoting adherence to safe practices by other staff and students. They are also potentially effective system engineers who can embed safer practices in all elements of patient care and promote essential structural and organizational change. Patients and the public in general are becoming increasingly aware of the risk of infection when entering a hospital and expect their carers to adhere to safe practice. Poor infection control practice will be regarded in a negative light by patients and their families, regardless of any other manifest skills of the practitioner.","Ferguson, J.

Scale organs in these families are concentrated on the face, and scale organs occur singly or in pairs below the keel on the dorsals of cordylids but not gerrhosaurids. Most species examined possess primitive, lenticular scale organs. Unique and previously unknown, projecting scale organs occur in two species of Cordylus. Scale organs appear to be absent in species of Chamaesaura. The scale surfaces of cordylids are covered in macrohoneycomb. Individual compartments of cordylid macrohoneycomb are not intracellular structures but may be overlain by apparent oberhautchen cells. In some cordylid species, part of each cell is free and projects away from the scale surface as a pointed flap. Gerrhosaurids lack macrohoneycomb. Instead, their scale surfaces are covered in lamellae without dentate borders, 50–100 times as long as wide. The epidermis of Platysaurus is unique among cordylids in possessing lamellae 1–8 times as wide as long that overlap macrohoneycomb in some regions of the body. The scale surfaces of Cordylus cordylus undergo an ontogenetic change similar to that recently described for the xenosaurid genus Shinisaurus. Phylogenetic analysis of scale surface features allows the partitioning of Cordylus into three species groups and Chamaesaura into two species groups.

It is extremely common in infancy; 20-30% of children have experienced recurrent episodic wheezing by the age of 12 months. Wheezing may result from widespread peripheral airway narrowing or, less commonly, from localized central disease. Excluding recurrent viral wheezing and asthma-like symptoms, all other specific causes of wheezing (e.g. cystic fibrosis, congenital airway disorders, chronic lung disease of prematurity) affect only 2-3% of the population. Although wheezing disease preceded by acute viral bronchiolitis early in infancy features prominently in most articles on childhood asthma, it affects, at most, 1% of the population. The increased prevalence of reported wheezing in industrialized countries until the mid-1990s, accompanied by an increase in the number of hospital admissions for wheezing, represents a true increase in the problem rather than simply increased awareness. In the UK, wheezing in pre-school children accounts for about 25% of acute hospital admissions in childhood, and almost 50% during epidemics of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection.","Silverman, Michael",Medicine (Abingdon),102,1

The increased number and use of antiviral agents, however, has led to the emergence of drug-resistant viruses, particularly in immunocompromised patients such as those with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or hematologic malignancy or those who have undergone organ transplantation. For comprehensive reviews on specific viruses, see references 26, 41, 64, 81–83, and 102. Clinical situations that favor the development of resistance include long-term suppressive therapy, recurrent intermittent therapy, and the use of less than optimum doses of an antiviral agent. Generally, the emergence and isolation of drug-resistant viruses is associated more so with the therapeutic use of antiviral agents and does not seem to be caused by prophylactic treatment. As more patients fail to respond to appropriate therapy and additional antiviral agents are produced, it will also become important for diagnostic virology laboratories to provide rapid and practical antiviral susceptibility testing to assist physicians in defining drug resistance and choosing appropriate alternative therapies. This review describes the major antiviral agents, their mechanisms of action, and the development of drug resistance following antiviral therapy. A brief overview of the available phenotypic and genotypic susceptibility assays for detecting antiviral resistance is also discussed.","Hodinka, Richard L.",Infect Dis Clin North Am,102,1

To reduce invasive diagnostics such as bronchoalveolar lavage and time-consuming in-hospital transports for imaging diagnostics, we hypothesized that particle flow rate (PFR) pattern from the airways could be an early detection method and contribute to improving diagnostics and optimizing personalized therapies. Porcine models were ventilated mechanically. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was administered endotracheally and in the pulmonary artery to induce ARDS. PFR was measured using a customized particles in exhaled air (PExA 2.0) device. In contrast to control animals undergoing mechanical ventilation and receiving saline administration, animals who received LPS developed ARDS according to clinical guidelines and histologic assessment. Plasma levels of TNF-α and IL-6 increased significantly compared with baseline after 120 and 180 min, respectively. On the other hand, the PFR significantly increased and peaked 60 min after LPS administration, i.e., ~30 min before any ARDS stage was observed with other well-established outcome measurements such as hypoxemia, increased inspiratory pressure, and lower tidal volumes or plasma cytokine levels. The present results imply that PFR could be used to detect early biomarkers or as a clinical indicator for the onset of ARDS.","Stenlo, Martin; Hyllén, Snejana; Silva, Iran A.

We aimed to evaluate these two factors as potential prognostic factors in critically poisoned patients admitted to our toxicology ICU. METHOD: This is a cross-sectional descriptive-analytic study that was performed on poisoned patients referred to emergency department of Loghman Hakim Hospital. One-hundred critically poisoned patients who had been admitted to ICU were conveniently chosen using a random number table and included into the study after obtaining consent forms from their next of kin. Their serum lactate and CK levels were checked on admission. These levels were compared subsequently between survivors and non-survivors to seek for their potential prognostic role. RESULTS: In a total of 100 patients enrolled, 61 were male. Serum level of lactate (with a cut off of 26 mg/dL) and serum CK with a cutoff point of 169 U/L could have prognosticated death with sensitivity and specificity of 78 and 77% (for lactate) and 74 and 62% (for serum CK), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In poisoned patients, serum lactate and CK can be used as possible prognostic factors because they rapidly increase in the serum and are easily detectable.","Golaghaei, Alireza; Hassanian-Moghaddam, Hossein; Shadnia, Shahin; Zamani, Nasim; Amraei, Fatemeh",BMC Emerg Med,102,8

This study aimed to explore the associations between MetS risk factors and the lung function. SUBJECTS/METHODS: The cross-sectional study included 6945 participants attending health examination between 2010 and 2012 in Taiwan. MetS was assessed according to the criteria of National Cholesterol Education Program III. Spirometric parameters were measured to define lung function. The relationships were tested using multiple linear regression and logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: The prevalence of MetS was significantly higher in males (16.2%) than females (3.8%). Although the prevalence of restrictive lung disease (RLD) was comparable between genders (20.7 and 21.0%), males with co-existent MetS had a higher prevalence of RLD than females (27.4 vs. 18.0%). Abdominal obesity, indicated by waist circumference (WC) and weight-to-height ratio (WHtR), was the most significant factor associated with lung function decline. Other components of MetS also showed statistically significant relationships, but very weak, with lung function. There was a trend toward an increased prevalence of RLD with the increasing number of MetS scores in males, independent of age, smoking, and body mass index. CONCLUSIONS: Abdominal obesity was the key component of MetS associated with mechanical effect on lung function impairment in a prime-age adult population. Although RLD was not associated with increased probability of having MetS, the participants with more MetS scores were at a higher risk of losing lung function.","Lee, Yi-Yen; Tsao, Yu-Chung; Yang, Chih-Kai; Chuang, Chung-Hsun; Yu, Wei; Chen, Jih-Chang; Li, Wen-Cheng",Eur J Clin Nutr,102,1

Immaturity of the follicular dendritic cells (FDCs), in particular, appears to play a critical role for the inability to stimulate immune responses. Using the CD21mT/mG mouse model we found that at 7 days of life, FDCs exhibited a mature phenotype only in the Peyer´s patches (PP), but our unique adjuvant, CTA1-DD, effectively matured FDCs also in peripheral lymph nodes following systemic, as well as mucosal immunizations. This was a direct effect of complement receptor 2-binding to the FDC and a CTA1-enzyme-dependent enhancing effect on gene transcription, among which CR2, IL-6, ICAM-1, IL-1β, and CXCL13 encoding genes were upregulated. This way we achieved FDC maturation, increased germinal center B-cell- and Tfh responses, and enhanced specific antibody levels close to adult magnitudes. Oral priming immunization of neonates against influenza infection with CTA1-3M2e-DD effectively promoted anti-M2e-immunity and significantly reduced morbidity against a live virus challenge infection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate direct effects of an adjuvant on FDC gene transcriptional functions and the subsequent enhancement of neonatal immune responses.","Schussek, Sophie; Bernasconi, Valentina; Mattsson, Johan; Wenzel, Ulf Alexander; Strömberg, Anneli; Gribonika, Inta; Schön, Karin; Lycke, Nils Y.",Mucosal Immunol,102,1

Early detection for its future epidemic trends plays a pivotal role in combating this threat. In this scenario, our study investigates the suitability for application in analyzing and forecasting the epidemic tendencies based on the monthly HFRS morbidity data from 2005 through 2019 using the nonlinear model-based self-exciting threshold autoregressive (SETAR) and logistic smooth transition autoregressive (LSTAR) methods. The experimental results manifested that the SETAR and LSTAR approaches presented smaller values among the performance measures in both two forecasting subsamples, when compared with the most extensively used seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) method, and the former slightly outperformed the latter. Descriptive statistics showed an epidemic tendency of downturn with average annual percent change (AAPC) of −5.640% in overall HFRS, however, an upward trend with an AAPC = 1.213% was observed since 2016 and according to the forecasts using the SETAR, it would seemingly experience an outbreak of HFRS in China in December 2019. Remarkably, there were dual-peak patterns in HFRS incidence with a strong one occurring in November until January of the following year, additionally, a weak one in May and June annually. Therefore, the SETAR and LSTAR approaches may be a potential useful tool in analyzing the temporal behaviors of HFRS in China.","Wang, Yongbin; Xu, Chunjie; Wu, Weidong; Ren, Jingchao; Li, Yuchun; Gui, Lihui; Yao, Sanqiao",Sci Rep,102,8

Twenty-eight per cent of all chromatin loops vary across cell types; these variations modestly correlate with changes in gene expression and are effective at grouping cell types according to their tissue of origin. The connectivity of genes corresponds to different functional classes, with housekeeping genes having few contacts, and dosage-sensitive genes being more connected to enhancer elements.

ZYZ-803 is a hybrid donor of hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) and nitric oxide (NO). Previous studies showed that ZYZ-803 stimulated endothelial cell angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we investigated whether the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and Ca(2+)/CaM-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) signaling was involved in ZYZ-803-induced angiogenesis. Treatment with ZYZ-803 (1 μM) significantly increased the phosphorylation of STAT3 (Tyr705) and CaMKII (Thr286) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), these two effects had a similar time course. Pretreatment with WP1066 (STAT3 inhibitor) or KN93 (CAMKII inhibitor) blocked ZYZ-803-induced STAT3/CAMKII activation and significantly suppressed the proliferation and migration of HUVECs. In addition, pretreatment with the inhibitors significantly decreased ZYZ-803-induced tube formations along with the outgrowths of branch-like microvessels in aortic rings. In the mice with femoral artery ligation, administration of ZYZ-803 significantly increased the blood perfusion and vascular density in the hind limb, whereas co-administration of WP1066 or KN93 abrogated ZYZ-803-induced angiogenesis. By using STAT3 siRNA, we further explored the cross-talk between STAT3 and CaMKII in ZYZ-803-induced angiogenesis. We found that STAT3 knockdown suppressed ZYZ-803-induced HUVEC angiogenesis and affected CaMKII expression. ZYZ-803 treatment markedly enhanced the interaction between CaMKII and STAT3. ZYZ-803 treatment induced the nuclear translocation of STAT3. We demonstrated that both STAT3 and CaMKII functioned as positive regulators in ZYZ-803-induced endothelial angiogenesis and STAT3 was important in ZYZ-803-induced CaMKII activation, which highlights the beneficial role of ZYZ-803 in STAT3/CaMKII-related cardiovascular diseases.","Xiong, Ying; Chang, Ling-ling; Tran, Bahieu; Dai, Tao; Zhong, Rui; Mao, Yi-cheng; Zhu, Yi-zhun",Acta Pharmacol Sin,102,1

Obesity is usually associated with chronic low-grade inflammation and may lead to the onset and progression of myocardial fibrosis and remodeling. TLR4/MyD88 signaling pathway, as a key regulator of inflammation, plays an important role in the pathogenesis of obesity-induced cardiomyopathy. We previously demonstrated that LM9, a novel MyD88 inhibitor, attenuated inflammatory responses and fibrosis in obesity-induced cardiomyopathy by inhibiting the formation of TLR4/MyD88 complex. In this study, we investigated the protective effects of LM9 on obesity-induced cardiomyopathy in vitro and in vivo. We showed that LM9 (5, 10 μM) significantly attenuates palmitic acid (PA)-induced inflammation in mouse peritoneal macrophages, evidenced by decreased expression of proinflammatory genes including TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and ICAM-1. In cardiac-derived H9C2 cells, LM9 treatment suppressed PA-induced inflammation, lipid accumulation, and fibrotic responses. In addition, LM9 treatment also inhibited PA-activated TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway. We further revealed in HEK293 cells that LM9 treatment blocked the TLR4/MyD88 binding and MyD88 homodimer formation. In HFD-fed mice, administration of LM9 (5, 10 mg/kg, ig, every other days for 8 weeks) dose-dependently alleviated inflammation and fibrosis in heart tissues and decreased serum lipid concentration. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that MyD88 inhibitor LM9 exerts protective effects against obesity-induced cardiomyopathy, suggesting LM9 to be a promising therapeutic candidate drug for the obesity-related cardiac complications.","Zheng, Xu-yong; Sun, Chu-chu; Liu, Qian; Lu, Xiao-yao; Fu, Li-li; Liang, Guang; Zhang, Xiu-hua; Chen, Gao-zhi",Acta Pharmacol Sin,102,1

In this study we investigated the role of macrophage-secreted UII in atherosclerosis progression, and evaluated the therapeutic value of urantide, a potent competitive UII receptor antagonist, in atherosclerosis treatment. Macrophage-specific human UII-transgenic rabbits and their nontransgenic littermates were fed a high cholesterol diet for 16 weeks to induce atherosclerosis. Immunohistochemical staining of the cellular components (macrophages and smooth muscle cells) of aortic atherosclerotic lesions revealed a significant increase (52%) in the macrophage-positive area in only male transgenic rabbits compared with that in the nontransgenic littermates. However, both male and female transgenic rabbits showed a significant decrease (45% in males and 31% in females) in the smooth muscle cell-positive area compared with that of their control littermates. The effects of macrophage-secreted UII on the plaque cellular components were independent of plasma lipid level. Meanwhile the wild-type rabbits were continuously subcutaneously infused with urantide (5.4 µg· kg(−1)· h(−1)) using osmotic mini-pumps. Infusion of urantide exerted effects opposite to those caused by UII, as it significantly decreased the macrophage-positive area in male wild-type rabbits compared with that of control rabbits. In cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells, treatment with UII dose-dependently increased the expression of the adhesion molecules VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, and this effect was partially reversed by urantide. The current study provides direct evidence that macrophage-secreted UII plays a key role in atherogenesis. Targeting UII with urantide may promote plaque stability by decreasing macrophage-derived foam cell formation, which is an indicator of unstable plaque.","Yu, Qing-qing; Cheng, Da-xin; Xu, Li-ran; Li, Yan-kui; Zheng, Xiao-ya; Liu, Yi; Li, Ya-feng; Liu, Hao-le; Bai, Liang; Wang, Rong; Fan, Jiang-lin; Liu, En-qi; Zhao, Si-hai",Acta Pharmacol Sin,102,1

LW-213, a newly synthesized flavonoid compound, was found to exert antitumor effects against breast cancer through inducing G2/M phase arrest. We investigated whether LW-213 exerted anti-CML effects and the underlying mechanisms. We showed that LW-213 inhibited the growth of human CML cell lines K562 and imatinid-resistant K562 (K562r) in dose- and time-dependent manners with IC(50) values at the low μmol/L levels. LW-213 (5, 10, 15 μM) caused G(2)/M phase arrest of K562 and K562r cells via reducing the activity of G2/M phase transition-related proteins Cyclin B1/CDC2 complex. LW-213 treatment induced apoptosis of K562 and K562r cells via inhibiting the expression of CDK9 through lysosome degradation, thus leading to the suppression of RNAPII phosphorylation, down-regulation of a short-lived anti-apoptic protein MCL-1. The lysosome inhibitor, NH(4)Cl, could reverse the anti-CML effects of LW-213 including CDK9 degradation and apoptosis. LW-213 treatment also degraded the downstream proteins of BCR-ABL1, such as oncoproteins AKT, STAT3/5 in CML cells, which was blocked by NH(4)Cl. In primary CML cells and CD34(+) stem cells, LW-213 maintained its pro-apoptotic activity. In a K562 cells-bearing mice model, administration of LW-213 (2.5, 5.0 mg/kg, ip, every other day for 4 weeks) dose-dependently prolonged the survival duration, and significantly suppressed huCD45(+) cell infiltration and expression of MCL-1 in spleens. Taken together, our results demonstrate that LW-213 may be an efficient agent for CML treatment.","Liu, Xiao; Hu, Po; Li, Hui; Yu, Xiao-xuan; Wang, Xiang-yuan; Qing, Ying-jie; Wang, Zhan-yu; Wang, Hong-zheng; Zhu, Meng-yuan; Guo, Qing-long; Hui, Hui",Acta Pharmacol Sin,102,1

A variety of potential drugs have been discovered to treat several neuronal disorders; however, their therapeutic success can be limited by the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Furthermore, unique immune functions within the CNS provide novel target mechanisms for the amelioration of CNS diseases. Recently, various therapeutic approaches have been applied to fight brain-related disorders, with moderate outcomes. Among the various therapeutic strategies, nanomedicine-based immunotherapeutic systems represent a new era that can deliver useful cargo with promising pharmacokinetics. These approaches exploit the molecular and cellular targeting of CNS disorders for enhanced safety, efficacy, and specificity. In this review, we focus on the efficacy of nanomedicines that utilize immunotherapy to combat CNS disorders. Furthermore, we detailed summarize nanomedicine-based pathways for CNS ailments that aim to deliver drugs across the BBB by mimicking innate immune actions.

In this article, we report a post hoc analysis of a prospective, single-center cohort study, including 447 patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Arachidonic acid (AA)- or adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet-fibrin clot strength (MA(AA) or MA(ADP)) was indicative of the net residual platelet reactivity after the treatment with aspirin or clopidogrel, respectively. AA% or ADP% was indices of the relative platelet inhibition rate on AA or ADP pathway. We found that each parameter alone was predictive of the risk of 6-month ischemic event, even after adjusting for confounding factors. However, the association between AA% and clinical outcome disappeared when further adjusted for MA(AA). Likewise, inclusion of MA(ADP) changed the significant relation between ADP% and clinical outcome. MA(ADP) > 47.0 mm and MA(AA) > 15.1 mm were identified as the optimal cutoffs by receiver operating characteristic analysis. High MA(AA) (HR = 3.963; 95% CI: 1.152–13.632; P = 0.029) and high MA(ADP) (HR = 5.185; 95% CI: 2.228–12.062; P < 0.001) were independent predictors when both were included in multivariable Cox regression hazards model. Interestingly, an even higher risk was found for the coexisting high MA(AA) and high MA(ADP) (HR = 7.870; 95% CI: 3.462–17.899; P < 0.001). We conclude that when performing TEG to predict clinical efficacy, residual platelet reactivity has superiority over platelet inhibition rate as a measure of thrombotic risk in patients treated with aspirin and clopidogrel after ACS.","Wu, Hong-yi; Zhang, Chi; Zhao, Xin; Qian, Ju-ying; Wang, Qi-bing; Ge, Jun-bo",Acta Pharmacol Sin,102,1

Nanoscale metal-organic frameworks (nMOFs), a class of crystalline-shaped nanomaterials formed by the self-assembly of organic ligands and metal nodes, are attractive for cancer immunotherapy because they feature tunable pore size, high surface area and loading capacity, and intrinsic biodegradability. In this review we summarize recent progress in the development of nMOFs for cancer immunotherapy, including cancer vaccine delivery and combination of in situ vaccination with immunomodulators to reverse immune suppression.

Our previous studies demonstrated that the deubiquitinase USP5 stabilizes c-Maf and promotes myeloma cell proliferation and survival; therefore, the USP5/c-Maf axis could be a potential target for myeloma therapy. As a concept of principle, the present study established a USP5/c-Maf-based luciferase system that was used to screen an FDA-approved drug library. It was found that mebendazole, a typical anthelmintic drug, preferentially induced apoptosis in c-Maf-expressing myeloma cells. Moreover, oral administration of mebendazole delayed the growth of human myeloma xenografts in nude mice but did not show overt toxicity. Further studies showed that the selective antimyeloma activity of mebendazole was associated with the inhibition of the USP5/c-Maf axis. Mebendazole downregulated USP5 expression and disrupted the interaction between USP5 and c-Maf, thus leading to increased levels of c-Maf ubiquitination and subsequent c-Maf degradation. Mebendazole inhibited c-Maf transcriptional activity, as confirmed by both luciferase assays and expression measurements of c-Maf downstream genes. In summary, this study identified mebendazole as a USP5/c-Maf inhibitor that could be developed as a novel antimyeloma agent.","Chen, Xue-han; Xu, Yu-jia; Wang, Xiao-ge; Lin, Peng; Cao, Bi-yin; Zeng, Yuan-ying; Wang, Qi; Zhang, Zu-bin; Mao, Xin-liang; Zhang, Tie",Acta Pharmacol Sin,102,1

Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a potent circulating regulator of LDL through its ability to induce degradation of the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol receptor (LDLR) in the lysosome of hepatocytes. Aloe-emodin (AE) is one of potentially bioactive components of Chinese traditional medicine Daming capsule. In this study we evaluated the HPL-lowering efficacy of AE in both in vivo and in vitro HPL models. High-fat diet-induced rats were treated with AE (100 mg/kg per day, ig) for 6 weeks. We found that AE administration significantly decreased the levels of total cholesterol (TC) and LDL in the serum and liver tissues. Moreover, AE administration ameliorated HPL-induced hepatic lipid aggregation. But AE administration did not significantly inhibit HMG-CoA reductase activity in the liver of HPL rats. A cellular model of HPL was established in human hepatoma (HepG2) cells treated with cholesterol (20 μg/mL) and 25-hydroxycholesterol (2 μg/mL), which exhibited markedly elevated cholesterol levels. The increased cholesterol levels could be reversed by subsequent treatment with AE (30 μM). In both the in vivo and in vitro HPL models, we revealed that AE selectively suppressed the sterol-regulatory element-binding protein-2 (SREBP-2) and hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)1α-mediated PCSK9 signaling, which in turn upregulated LDL receptor (LDLR) and promoted LDL uptake. This study demonstrates that AE reduces cholesterol content in HPL rats by inhibiting the hepatic PCSK9/LDLR pathway.","Su, Zhen-li; Hang, Peng-zhou; Hu, Juan; Zheng, Yu-yang; Sun, Han-qi; Guo, Jing; Liu, Ke-yu; Du, Zhi-min",Acta Pharmacol Sin,102,17

Ramelteon is a selective melatonin receptor agonist used to treat insomnia. In this study we investigated whether ramelteon could attenuate cerebral ischemia in mice. Acute focal cerebral ischemia was induced in mice via middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). We found oral administration of ramelteon (3.0 mg/kg) significantly attenuated ischemic injury even when it was given 4 h after the onset of ischemia. We showed that administration of ramelteon (3.0 mg/kg) displayed comparable protective efficacy and length of effective time window as administration of edaravone (10 mg/kg, i.p.), which was used in clinic to treat ischemic stroke. Chronic ischemic brain injury was induced in mice using photothrombosis. Oral administration of ramelteon (3.0 mg · kg(−1) · d(−1)) for 7 days after ischemia significantly attenuated functional deficits for at least 15 days. The neuroprotection of ramelteon was blocked by 4-P-PDOT, a specific MT antagonist. We further revealed that ramelteon significantly inhibited autophagy in the peri-infarct cortex in both the mouse ischemia models via regulating AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway. Intracerebroventricular injection of rapamycin, an autophagy activator, compromised the neuroprotection of ramelteon, suggesting ramelteon might attenuate ischemic injury by counteracting autophagic cell death. These data demonstrate for the first time the potential benefits of ramelteon in the treatment of both acute and chronic ischemic brain injury and provide the rationale for the application of ramelteon in stroke therapy.","Wu, Xiao-li; Lu, Shou-sheng; Liu, Meng-ru; Tang, Wei-dong; Chen, Jun-zi; Zheng, Yan-rong; Ahsan, Anil; Cao, Ming; Jiang, Lei; Hu, Wei-wei; Wu, Jia-ying; Chen, Zhong; Zhang, Xiang-nan",Acta Pharmacol Sin,102,1

In this study, we investigated the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of SUL in nude mice and developed a semi-mechanism PK/PD model to quantitatively characterize the synergistic effect of DEX and SUL in preclinical breast cancer xenografts. After nude mice received oral administration of a single dose of SUL (50 mg/kg, ig), plasma concentrations were assessed using LC-MS/MS. A two-compartment model with double first-order absorption rate was developed to describe the PK profiles of SUL. The pharmacodynamic (PD) study was conducted in nude mice bearing human breast cancer MCF-7/Adr xenografts, which received oral administration of DEX (1, 8 mg·kg(−1)·d(−1)) or SUL (25, 50 mg·kg(−1)·d(−1)) alone or in various combination. Tumor volumes were measured every other day. The PK model of SUL as well as that of DEX with a time-dependent clearance were integrated into the final PK/PD model both using Hill’s function, where DEX exerted its antitumor efficacy by inhibiting the proliferation of tumor cells, and SUL enhanced DEX responses by decreasing the sensitivity parameter EC(50). The PK/PD model was evaluated and subjected external validation. Finally, simulations were performed to predict the antitumor efficacy of DEX combined with SUL under various dose regimens, where changing dosing frequency of SUL had little effect, while the antitumor efficacy was predicted to be improved when DEX was given more frequently. The established PK/PD model in this study quantitatively characterizes the antitumor efficacy of the DEX combined with SUL as well as their synergism, and the simulations could provide reference for dose optimization of the combination in future studies.","Yao, Qing-yu; Li, Jian; Chen, Rong; Yao, Ye; Xue, Jun-sheng; Chen, Wen-jun; Lu, Wei; Zhou, Tian-yan",Acta Pharmacol Sin,102,1

The main pathological hallmark of PD is the formation of Lewy bodies (LBs) and Lewy neurites, both of which contain the presynaptic protein alpha-synuclein (α-syn). Under normal conditions, native α-syn exists in a soluble unfolded state but undergoes misfolding and aggregation into toxic aggregates under pathological conditions. Toxic α-syn species, especially oligomers, can cause oxidative stress, membrane penetration, synaptic and mitochondrial dysfunction, as well as other damage, leading to neuronal death and eventually neurodegeneration. Early diagnosis and treatments targeting PD pathogenesis are urgently needed. Given its critical role in PD, α-syn is an attractive target for the development of both diagnostic tools and effective therapeutics.

However, quantitative information on the social function of schizophrenic patients treated with atypical antipsychotics is scarce in the current clinical guidelines. In this study, we established pharmacodynamic models to quantify the time–efficacy relationship of three antipsychotic drugs based on the data from a real-world study conducted in China. A total of 373 schizophrenic patients who received antipsychotic monotherapy with olanzapine (n = 144), risperidone (n = 160), or aripiprazole (n = 69) were selected from a three-year prospective, multicenter study.

To establish the mouse obesity model, both Clcn3(−/−) mice and wild-type mice were fed a HFD for 4 or 16 weeks. The metabolic parameters were assessed and the abdominal total adipose tissue was scanned using computed tomography.

However, whether Timo AIII suppresses tumor angiogenesis remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the antiangiogenesis effects of Timo AIII and the underlying mechanisms in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in vitro and zebrafish embryos in vivo. We showed that treatment with Timo AIII (0.5–2 µM) partially disrupted the intersegmental vessels (ISVs) and subintestinal vessels (SIVs) growth in transgenic zebrafish Tg(fli-1a: EGFP)(y1). Timo AIII (0.5–4 µM) dose-dependently inhibited VEGF-induced proliferation, migration, invasion, and tube formation of HUVECs, but these inhibitory effects were not due to its cytotoxicity. We further demonstrated that Timo AIII treatment significantly suppressed the expression of VEGF receptor (VEGFR) and the phosphorylation of Akt, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2 in HUVECs. Timo AIII treatment also significantly inhibited VEGF-triggered phosphorylation of VEGFR2, Akt, and ERK1/2 in HUVECs. Moreover, we conducted RNA-Seq and analyzed the transcriptome changes in both HUVECs and zebrafish embryos following Timo AIII treatment. The coexpression network analysis results showed that various biological processes and signaling pathways were enriched including angiogenesis, cell motility, cell adhesion, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, transmembrane signaling receptor activity, growth factor activity, etc., which was consistent with the antiangiogenesis effects of Timo AIII in HUVECs and zebrafish embryos.

Silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1), a class III histone deacetylase, has been shown to play an important role in neuroprotection against cerebral ischemia. In this study, we investigated whether CAG protected against ischemic brain injury and, if so, whether the beneficial effects were associated with the regulation of SIRT1 in the ischemic brain. Mice were subjected to 45 min of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by reperfusion. CAG (5, 10, 20 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally at the onset of reperfusion, 12 h later and then twice daily for up to three days. CAG dose-dependently reduced brain infarct volume, significantly ameliorated functional deficits, and prevented neuronal cell loss in MCAO mice. Meanwhile, CAG significantly reduced matrix metalloproteinase-9 activity, prevented tight junction degradation and subsequently ameliorated blood-brain barrier disruption. Moreover, CAG significantly upregulated SIRT1 expression in the ischemic brain but did not directly activate its enzymatic activity. Concomitant with SIRT1 upregulation, CAG reduced p53 acetylation and the ratio of Bax to Bcl-2 in the ischemic brain. CAG also inhibited NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation. As a result, CAG suppressed the mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α and IL-1β, and inhibited the activation of microglia and astrocytes in the ischemic brain. Our findings suggest that CAG is neuroprotective against ischemic brain injury in mice and that its beneficial effect may involve SIRT1 upregulation and the inhibition of apoptosis and neuroinflammation in the ischemic brain.","Li, Man; Li, Shi-chun; Dou, Bao-kai; Zou, Ying-xiang; Han, Hao-zhen; Liu, Dong-xiang; Ke, Zun-ji; Wang, Zhi-fei",Acta Pharmacol Sin,102,1

An early study in a glutamate-induced mouse seizure model demonstrated that GM was one of the active ingredients of UR. In this study, electrophysiological technique was used to explore the mechanism underlying the antiepileptic activity of GM. We first showed that GM (1−30 μmol/L) dose-dependently suppressed the spontaneous firing and prolonged the action potential duration in cultured mouse and rat hippocampal neurons. Given the pivotal roles of ion channels in regulating neuronal excitability, we then examined the effects of GM on both voltage-gated and ligand-gated channels in rat hippocampal neurons. We found that GM is an inhibitor of multiple neuronal channels: GM potently inhibited the voltage-gated sodium (Na(V)), calcium (Ca(V)), and delayed rectifier potassium (I(K)) currents, and the ligand-gated nicotinic acetylcholine (nACh) currents with IC(50) values in the range of 1.3−13.3 μmol/L. In contrast, GM had little effect on the voltage-gated transient outward potassium currents (I(A)) and four types of ligand-gated channels (γ-amino butyric acid (GABA), N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate/kainite (AMPA/KA receptors)).

In the maximal electroshock (MES)-induced mouse seizure model, oral administration of GM (50−100 mg/kg) dose-dependently suppressed generalized tonic-clonic seizures. In 6-Hz-induced mouse seizure model, oral administration of GM (100 mg/kg) reduced treatment-resistant seizures. Thus, we conclude that GM is a promising antiepileptic candidate that inhibits multiple neuronal channels.","Xie, Zhu-qing; Tian, Xiao-ting; Zheng, Yue-ming; Zhan, Li; Chen, Xue-qin; Xin, Xiao-ming; Huang, Cheng-gang; Gao, Zhao-bing",Acta Pharmacol Sin,102,1

We showed that 23,24-dihydrocucurbitacin B (1–5 μM) dose-dependently promoted DiI-LDL uptake in HepG2 cells by upregulating low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) protein. In HepG2 cells, 23,24-dihydrocucurbitacin B (1–10 μM) dose-dependently enhanced LDLR promoter activity by elevating the mature form of SREBP2 (sterol regulatory element binding protein 2) protein levels on one hand, and inhibited PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) promoter activity by attenuating HNF1α (hepatocyte nuclear factor-1α) protein levels in nuclei on the other hand. Consequently, the expression of LDLR protein markedly increased, whereas the PCSK9-mediated LDLR protein degradation decreased. In a high-cholesterol LVG golden Syrian Hamster model, administration of 23,24-dihydrocucurbitacin B (30 mg · kg(−1)⋅ d(−1), intragastric, for 3 weeks) significantly decreased the serum LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. PCSK9 protein levels in the serum and liver tissues were significantly decreased, whereas LDLR protein levels in liver tissues were significantly increased in the treated animals as compared with the control animals. In conclusion, our study demonstrates for the first time that 23,24-dihydrocucurbitacin B exhibits dual transcriptional regulation of LDLR and PCSK9 in HepG2 cells by increasing SREBP2 protein levels and decreasing HNF1α protein levels in the nuclei. These results propose a new strategy to simultaneously manage LDLR and PCSK9 protein expression and provide a promising lead compound for drug development.","Li, Hui-hui; Li, Jun; Zhang, Xian-jing; Li, Jiao-meng; Xi, Cong; Wang, Wen-qiong; Lu, You-li; Xuan, Li-jiang",Acta Pharmacol Sin,102,1

Our previous studies show that propofol-induced neurodegeneration and neurogenesis are closely associated with cell autophagy. In the present study we explored the roles of autophagy-related gene 5 (ATG5) in propofol-induced autophagy in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) in vitro. We showed that ATG5 was functionally related to propofol-induced cell survival and damage: propofol significantly enhanced cell survival and proliferation at a clinically relevant dose (10 µM), but caused cell death at an extremely high concentration (200 µM) in ATG5(−/−) MEF, but not in WT cells. The dual effects found in ATG5(−/−) MEF could be blocked by intracellular Ca(2+) channel antagonists. We also found that propofol evoked a moderate (promote cell growth) and extremely high (cause apoptosis) cytosolic Ca(2+) elevation at the concentrations of 10 µM and 200 µM, respectively, only in ATG5(−/−) MEF. In addition, ATG5(−/−) MEF themselves released more Ca(2+) in cytosolic space and endoplasmic reticulum compared with WT cells, suggesting that autophagy deficiency made intracellular calcium signaling more vulnerable to external stimuli (propofol). Altogether, our results reveal that ATG5 plays a crucial role in propofol regulation of cell survival and proliferation by affecting intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis.","Xu, Zhen-dong; Wang, Yong; Liang, Ge; Liu, Zhi-qiang; Ma, Wu-hua; Chu, Charleen T; Wei, Hua-feng",Acta Pharmacol Sin,102,17

Huperzine A (Hup A), a Lycopodium alkaloid extracted from the Chinese herb moss Huperzia serrata, is a specific and reversible inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase, which is clinically used for the treatment of AD. In this study, we investigated whether Hup A improved the metabolic and cognitive functions in the high fat-induced (HFD) obese mice and genetic ob/ob mice. HFD and ob/ob mice were treated with Hup A (0.1, 0.3 mg · kg(−1) · d(−1), ig) for 3 months. Body weight was monitored and glucose tolerance tests were performed. Novel object recognition test and Morris water maze assay were conducted to evaluate the cognitive functions. We found that the Hup A treatment had no significant effect on peripheral metabolism of obese mice, whereas Hup A (0.1, mg · kg(−1) · d(−1)) improved both the abilities of object recognition and spatial memory in HFD-fed mice, but not in ob/ob mice. Furthermore, Hup A treatment significantly upregulated the insulin and phosphorylated Akt levels in the cortex of HFD-fed mice, but not ob/ob mice. In addition, Hup A (0.3, mg · kg(−1) · d(−1)) significantly decreased cortical β-secretase (BACE1) expression. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that treatment with Hup A (0.1, mg · kg(−1) · d(−1)) can effectively improve the cognitive functions, at least in diet-induced obese mice.","Wang, Hong-ying; Wu, Min; Diao, Jun-ling; Li, Ji-bin; Sun, Yu-xiang; Xiao, Xiao-qiu",Acta Pharmacol Sin,102,1

But routine use of MRS is limited by its cost and availability. In this study, we developed a diagnostic model combining ultrasonography with biomarkers to identify mild NAFLD, with MRS as the reference standard. A total of 422 eligible subjects were enrolled. The serum levels of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), cytokeratin 18 M65ED, proteinase 3, neutrophil elastase, alpha-1 antitrypsin, and neutrophil elastase/alpha-1 antitrypsin were measured using ELISA assays. We found that among the six biomarkers, only serum FGF21 was independently associated with intrahepatic triglyceride content (IHTC, standardized β = 0.185, P < 0.001) and was an independent risk factor for mild NAFLD. Thus, we established a Mild NAFLD Model based on FGF21, alanine transaminase, triglycerides, and body mass index. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of the Mild NAFLD Model was 0.853 (95% confidence interval: 0.816–0.886). Furthermore, a two-step approach combining ultrasonography with the Mild NAFLD Model displayed a better sensitivity for diagnosing mild NAFLD compared with each method alone, with a sensitivity of 97.32% and a negative predictive value of 85.48%. This two-step approach combining ultrasonography and the Mild NAFLD Model derived from serum FGF21 improves the diagnosis of mild NAFLD and can be applied to the early diagnosis of NAFLD in clinical practice.","Qian, Ling-ling; Wu, Liang; Zhang, Lei; Zhang, Jing; Zhou, Jia; Li, Yue-hua; Fang, Qi-chen; Li, Hua-ting; Jia, Wei-ping",Acta Pharmacol Sin,102,1

These adaptations vary in magnitude and direction following different patterns of opioid exposure, but few studies have systematically manipulated the pattern of opioid administration while measuring neurobiological and behavioral impact. We exposed male and female mice to morphine for one week, with administration patterns that were either intermittent (daily injections) or continuous (osmotic minipump infusion). We then interrupted continuous morphine exposure with either naloxone-precipitated or spontaneous withdrawal. Continuous morphine exposure caused tolerance to the psychomotor-activating effects of morphine, whereas both intermittent and interrupted morphine exposure caused long-lasting psychomotor sensitization. Given links between locomotor sensitization and mesolimbic dopamine signaling, we used fiber photometry and a genetically encoded dopamine sensor to conduct longitudinal measurements of dopamine dynamics in the nucleus accumbens. Locomotor sensitization caused by interrupted morphine exposure was accompanied by enhanced dopamine signaling in the nucleus accumbens. To further assess downstream consequences on striatal gene expression, we used next-generation RNA sequencing to perform genome-wide transcriptional profiling in the nucleus accumbens and dorsal striatum. The interruption of continuous morphine exposure exacerbated drug-evoked transcriptional changes in both nucleus accumbens and dorsal striatum, dramatically increasing differential gene expression and engaging unique signaling pathways. Our study indicates that opioid-evoked adaptations in brain function and behavior are critically dependent on the pattern of drug administration, and exacerbated by interruption of continuous exposure. Maintaining continuity of chronic opioid administration may, therefore, represent a strategy to minimize iatrogenic effects on brain reward circuits.","Lefevre, Emilia M.; Pisansky, Marc T.; Toddes, Carlee; Baruffaldi, Federico; Pravetoni, Marco; Tian, Lin; Kono, Thomas J.

It is crucial in studies using these systems to test the potential effects of DREADD actuators prior to any DREADD transduction, so that effects of DREADDs can be attributed to the chemogenetic system rather than the actuator drug, particularly in experiments using nonhuman primates. We investigated working memory performance after injections of three DREADD actuators, clozapine, olanzapine, and deschloroclozapine, in four male rhesus monkeys tested in a spatial delayed response task before any DREADD transduction took place. Performance at 0.1 mg/kg clozapine and 0.1 mg/kg deschloroclozapine did not differ from vehicle in any of the four subjects. 0.2 mg/kg clozapine impaired working memory function in three of the four monkeys. Two monkeys were impaired after 0.1 mg/kg olanzapine and two were impaired after 0.3 mg/kg deschloroclozapine. We speculate that the unique neuropharmacology of prefrontal cortex function makes the primate prefrontal cortex especially vulnerable to off-target effects of DREADD actuator drugs with affinity for endogenous monoaminergic receptor systems. These findings underscore the importance of within-subject controls for DREADD actuator drugs in the specific tasks under study to confirm that effects following DREADD receptor transduction are not owing to the actuator drug itself. They also suggest that off-target effects of DREADD actuators may limit translational applications of chemogenetic neuromodulation.","Upright, Nicholas A.; Baxter, Mark G.",Neuropsychopharmacology,102,8

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This study is a retrospective analysis of a case set of 17 torture survivors subjected to FSG, who were seen by the UK Charity Freedom from Torture in the period 2009–2019. RESULTS: All clients in our case set had experienced serious physical and sexual assaults, in addition to the FSG, as part of their mistreatment. All clients suffered with serious psychological conditions as a result of their torture, including depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). These mental health conditions made ophthalmic assessment difficult, not simply because of the clients’ associated anxiety, but also because of avoidant behaviour and dissociation which was manifested in the clinical setting. In the two clients who could be examined by an ophthalmologist, both had visible retinal changes and a degree of impairment of visual acuity. CONCLUSION: FSG appears to be a method of torture which is regularly employed, and in our case set is seen with other serious manifestations of mistreatment, both physical, psychological and sexual. Psychiatric comorbidities present challenges in the clinical assessment of these cases. Ophthalmic examination can carry a risk of re-traumatisation of individuals who have experienced FSG in a context of torture.","Fetherston, Tim",Eye (Lond),102,1

Despite its importance, the entire structure of the tetrameric assembly of EBOV VP35 and the means by which it antagonizes the autophosphorylation of the kinase domain of human protein kinase R (PKR(K)) is still elusive. We consult existing structural information to model a tetrameric assembly of the VP35 protein where 93% of the protein is modeled using crystal structure templates. We analyze our modeled tetrameric structure to identify interchain bonding networks and use molecular dynamics simulations and normal-mode analysis to unravel the flexibility and deformability of the different regions of the VP35 protein. We establish that the C-terminal of VP35 (VP35(C)) directly interacts with PKR(K) to prevent it from autophosphorylation. Further, we identify three plausible VP35(C)–PKR(K) complexes with better affinity than the PKR(K) dimer formed during autophosphorylation and use protein design to establish a new stretch in VP35(C) that interacts with PKR(K). The proposed tetrameric assembly will aid in better understanding of the VP35 protein, and the reported VP35(C)–PKR(K) complexes along with their interacting sites will help in the shortlisting of small molecule inhibitors.","Banerjee, Anupam; Mitra, Pralay",J Proteome Res,102,1

To control a bacterial infection, an immune response is required, but this response might contribute to organ failure. Kidneys are one of the main organs affected by bacteremia. Combination therapies with antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects may be beneficial in treating bacteremia. This study aimed to develop nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) loaded with ciprofloxacin and rolipram that exert a combination of anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and anti-inflammatory effects. Retinol was incorporated into the nanoparticles to transport retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) to the kidneys, which abundantly express RBP receptors. The NLCs were fabricated by high-shear homogenization and sonication, and neutrophils were used as a model to assess their anti-inflammatory effects. Mice were injected with MRSA to establish a model of bacteremia with organ injury. RESULTS: The mean nanoparticle size and zeta potential of the NLCs were 171 nm and − 39 mV, respectively. Ciprofloxacin (0.05%, w/v) and rolipram (0.02%) achieved encapsulation percentages of 88% and 96%, respectively, in the nanosystems. The minimum bactericidal concentration of free ciprofloxacin against MRSA increased from 1.95 to 15.63 µg/ml when combined with rolipram, indicating a possible drug-drug interaction that reduced the antibacterial effect. Nanoparticle inclusion promoted the anti-MRSA activity of ciprofloxacin according to time-kill curves. The NLCs were found to be largely internalized into neutrophils and exhibited superior superoxide anion inhibition than free drugs. Retinol incorporation into the nanocarriers facilitated their efficient targeting to the kidneys. The NLCs significantly mitigated MRSA burden and elastase distribution in the organs of MRSA-infected animals, and the greatest inhibition was observed in the kidneys. Bacterial clearance and neutrophil infiltration suppression attenuated the bacteremia-induced cytokine overexpression, leading to an improvement in the survival rate from 22% to 67%. CONCLUSIONS: The dual role of our NLCs endowed them with greater efficacy in treating MRSA bacteremia than that of free drugs.

Both viruses, as well as the more distantly related Epstein-Barr virus, engage cellular receptors from the Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases (Ephs). However, the importance of the Eph interaction for RRV entry varies between cell types suggesting the existence of Eph-independent entry pathways. We therefore aimed to identify additional cellular receptors for RRV by affinity enrichment and mass spectrometry. We identified an additional receptor family, the Plexin domain containing proteins 1 and 2 (Plxdc1/2) that bind the RRV gH/gL glycoprotein complex. Preincubation of RRV with soluble Plxdc2 decoy receptor reduced infection by ~60%, while overexpression of Plxdc1 and 2 dramatically enhanced RRV susceptibility and cell-cell fusion of otherwise marginally permissive Raji cells. While the Plxdc2 interaction is conserved between two RRV strains, 26–95 and 17577, Plxdc1 specifically interacts with RRV 26–95 gH. The Plxdc interaction is mediated by a short motif at the N-terminus of RRV gH that is partially conserved between isolate 26–95 and isolate 17577, but absent in KSHV gH. Mutation of this motif abrogated the interaction with Plxdc1/2 and reduced RRV infection in a cell type-specific manner. Taken together, our findings characterize Plxdc1/2 as novel interaction partners and entry receptors for RRV and support the concept of the N-terminal domain of the gammaherpesviral gH/gL complex as a multifunctional receptor-binding domain. Further, Plxdc1/2 usage defines an important biological difference between KSHV and RRV.","Großkopf, Anna K.; Schlagowski, Sarah; Fricke, Thomas; Ensser, Armin; Desrosiers, Ronald C.; Hahn, Alexander S.",PLoS Pathog,102,8

Hence, intratumoural delivery and tumour tissue-targeted compounds are attractive options to increase the in situ bioavailability and, thus, the efficacy of immunotherapies. In mouse models, intratumoural administration of immunostimulatory monoclonal antibodies, pattern recognition receptor agonists, genetically engineered viruses, bacteria, cytokines or immune cells can exert powerful effects not only against the injected tumours but also often against uninjected lesions (abscopal or anenestic effects). Alternatively, or additionally, biotechnology strategies are being used to achieve higher functional concentrations of immune mediators in tumour tissues, either by targeting locally overexpressed moieties or engineering ‘unmaskable’ agents to be activated by elements enriched within tumour tissues. Clinical trials evaluating these strategies are ongoing, but their development faces issues relating to the administration methodology, pharmacokinetic parameters, pharmacodynamic end points, and immunobiological and clinical response assessments. Herein, we discuss these approaches in the context of their historical development and describe the current landscape of intratumoural or tumour tissue-targeted immunotherapies.","Melero, Ignacio; Castanon, Eduardo; Alvarez, Maite; Champiat, Stephane; Marabelle, Aurelien",Nat Rev Clin Oncol,102,8

Being a satellite virus of hepatitis B virus (HBV), HDV requires HBV envelope glycoproteins for its infection cycle and its transmission. HDV pathogenesis varies and depends on the mode of HDV and HBV infection; a simultaneous HDV and HBV infection will lead to an acute hepatitis that will resolve spontaneously in the majority of patients, whereas an HDV super-infection of a chronic HBV carrier will mainly result in the establishment of a chronic HDV infection that may progress towards cirrhosis, liver decompensation, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). With this review, we aim to unravel Ariadne’s thread into the labyrinth of acute and chronic HDV infection pathogenesis and will provide insights into the complexity of this exciting topic by detailing the different players and mechanisms that shape the clinical outcome.","Tseligka, Eirini D.; Clément, Sophie; Negro, Francesco",Viruses,102,1

This study evaluated influenza-associated abnormal blood coagulation utilizing a severe influenza mouse model. After infecting C57BL/6 male mice with intranasal applications of 500 plaque-forming units of influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1; PR8), an elevated serum level of prothrombin fragment 1 + 2, an indicator for activated thrombin generation, was observed. Also, an increased gene expression of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-1 (Olr1), a key molecule in endothelial dysfunction in the progression of atherosclerosis, was detected in the aorta of infected mice. Body weight decrease, serum levels of cytokines and chemokines, viral load, and inflammation in the lungs of infected animals were similar between wild-type and Olr1 knockout (KO) mice. In contrast, the elevation of prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 levels in the sera and intravascular thrombosis in the lungs by PR8 virus infection were not induced in KO mice. Collectively, the results indicated that OLR1 is a critical host factor in intravascular thrombosis as a pathogeny of severe influenza. Thus, OLR1 is a promising novel therapeutic target for thrombosis during severe influenza.","Ohno, Marumi; Kakino, Akemi; Sekiya, Toshiki; Nomura, Naoki; Shingai, Masashi; Sawamura, Tatsuya; Kida, Hiroshi",Sci Rep,102,8

It is necessary to evaluate the risk factors of fever in patients undergoing PCNL, to provide insights into the management of PCNL. Patients who underwent PCNL in our hospital from January 2018 to August 2020 were included. The clinical data of postoperative fever and no fever patients were collected and assessed. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to analyze the risk factors for fever in patients undergoing PCNL. A total of 276 patients undergoing PCNL were included, the incidence of postoperative fever for patients undergoing PCNL was 19.39%. No significant differences in the gender, body mass index, alcohol drinking, smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, intraoperative blood infusion, length of hospital stay between fever patients, and no fever patients were found (all P > .05). There were significant differences in the age, diabetes, size of stones, duration of surgery between fever patients, and no fever patients (all P < .05). Age ≥60 years (odds ratio [OR] 2.143, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.101∼3.264), diabetes (OR 2.218, 95% CI 1.176∼4.642), size of stone ≥2 cm (OR 1.428, 95%CI 1.104∼2.055), duration of surgery ≥100 minutes (OR 1.334, 95% CI 1.015∼1.923) were the risk factors for fever in patients with PCNL (all P < .05).

An English-language version of these guidelines was created based on the contents of the original Japanese-language version. The purpose of this guideline is to assist medical staff in making appropriate decisions to improve the prognosis of patients undergoing treatment for sepsis and septic shock. We aimed to provide high-quality guidelines that are easy to use and understand for specialists, general clinicians, and multidisciplinary medical professionals. J-SSCG 2016 took up new subjects that were not present in SSCG 2016 (e.g., ICU-acquired weakness [ICU-AW], post-intensive care syndrome [PICS], and body temperature management). The J-SSCG 2020 covered a total of 22 areas with four additional new areas (patient- and family-centered care, sepsis treatment system, neuro-intensive treatment, and stress ulcers). A total of 118 important clinical issues (clinical questions, CQs) were extracted regardless of the presence or absence of evidence. These CQs also include those that have been given particular focus within Japan. This is a large-scale guideline covering multiple fields; thus, in addition to the 25 committee members, we had the participation and support of a total of 226 members who are professionals (physicians, nurses, physiotherapists, clinical engineers, and pharmacists) and medical workers with a history of sepsis or critical illness. The GRADE method was adopted for making recommendations, and the modified Delphi method was used to determine recommendations by voting from all committee members. As a result, 79 GRADE-based recommendations, 5 Good Practice Statements (GPS), 18 expert consensuses, 27 answers to background questions (BQs), and summaries of definitions and diagnosis of sepsis were created as responses to 118 CQs. We also incorporated visual information for each CQ according to the time course of treatment, and we will also distribute this as an app. The J-SSCG 2020 is expected to be widely used as a useful bedside guideline in the field of sepsis treatment both in Japan and overseas involving multiple disciplines.","Egi, Moritoki; Ogura, Hiroshi; Yatabe, Tomoaki; Atagi, Kazuaki; Inoue, Shigeaki; Iba, Toshiaki; Kakihana, Yasuyuki; Kawasaki, Tatsuya; Kushimoto, Shigeki; Kuroda, Yasuhiro; Kotani, Joji; Shime, Nobuaki; Taniguchi, Takumi; Tsuruta, Ryosuke; Doi, Kent; Doi, Matsuyuki; Nakada, Taka-aki; Nakane, Masaki; Fujishima, Seitaro; Hosokawa, Naoto; Masuda, Yoshiki; Matsushima, Asako; Matsuda, Naoyuki; Yamakawa, Kazuma; Hara, Yoshitaka; Sakuraya, Masaaki; Ohshimo, Shinichiro; Aoki, Yoshitaka; Inada, Mai; Umemura, Yutaka; Kawai, Yusuke; Kondo, Yutaka; Saito, Hiroki; Taito, Shunsuke; Takeda, Chikashi; Terayama, Takero; Tohira, Hideo; Hashimoto, Hideki; Hayashida, Kei; Hifumi, Toru; Hirose, Tomoya; Fukuda, Tatsuma; Fujii, Tomoko; Miura, Shinya; Yasuda, Hideto; Abe, Toshikazu; Andoh, Kohkichi; Iida, Yuki; Ishihara, Tadashi; Ide, Kentaro; Ito, Kenta; Ito, Yusuke; Inata, Yu; Utsunomiya, Akemi; Unoki, Takeshi; Endo, Koji; Ouchi, Akira; Ozaki, Masayuki; Ono, Satoshi; Katsura, Morihiro; Kawaguchi, Atsushi; Kawamura, Yusuke; Kudo, Daisuke; Kubo, Kenji; Kurahashi, Kiyoyasu; Sakuramoto, Hideaki; Shimoyama, Akira; Suzuki, Takeshi; Sekine, Shusuke; Sekino, Motohiro; Takahashi, Nozomi; Takahashi, Sei; Takahashi, Hiroshi; Tagami, Takashi; Tajima, Goro; Tatsumi, Hiroomi; Tani, Masanori; Tsuchiya, Asuka; Tsutsumi, Yusuke; Naito, Takaki; Nagae, Masaharu; Nagasawa, Ichiro; Nakamura, Kensuke; Nishimura, Tetsuro; Nunomiya, Shin; Norisue, Yasuhiro; Hashimoto, Satoru; Hasegawa, Daisuke; Hatakeyama, Junji; Hara, Naoki; Higashibeppu, Naoki; Furushima, Nana; Furusono, Hirotaka; Matsuishi, Yujiro; Matsuyama, Tasuku; Minematsu, Yusuke; Miyashita, Ryoichi; Miyatake, Yuji; Moriyasu, Megumi; Yamada, Toru; Yamada, Hiroyuki; Yamamoto, Ryo; Yoshida, Takeshi; Yoshida, Yuhei; Yoshimura, Jumpei; Yotsumoto, Ryuichi; Yonekura, Hiroshi; Wada, Takeshi; Watanabe, Eizo; Aoki, Makoto; Asai, Hideki; Abe, Takakuni; Igarashi, Yutaka; Iguchi, Naoya; Ishikawa, Masami; Ishimaru, Go; Isokawa, Shutaro; Itakura, Ryuta; Imahase, Hisashi; Imura, Haruki; Irinoda, Takashi; Uehara, Kenji; Ushio, Noritaka; Umegaki, Takeshi; Egawa, Yuko; Enomoto, Yuki; Ota, Kohei; Ohchi, Yoshifumi; Ohno, Takanori; Ohbe, Hiroyuki; Oka, Kazuyuki; Okada, Nobunaga; Okada, Yohei; Okano, Hiromu; Okamoto, Jun; Okuda, Hiroshi; Ogura, Takayuki; Onodera, Yu; Oyama, Yuhta; Kainuma, Motoshi; Kako, Eisuke; Kashiura, Masahiro; Kato, Hiromi; Kanaya, Akihiro; Kaneko, Tadashi; Kanehata, Keita; Kano, Ken-ichi; Kawano, Hiroyuki; Kikutani, Kazuya; Kikuchi, Hitoshi; Kido, Takahiro; Kimura, Sho; Koami, Hiroyuki; Kobashi, Daisuke; Saiki, Iwao; Sakai, Masahito; Sakamoto, Ayaka; Sato, Tetsuya; Shiga, Yasuhiro; Shimoto, Manabu; Shimoyama, Shinya; Shoko, Tomohisa; Sugawara, Yoh; Sugita, Atsunori; Suzuki, Satoshi; Suzuki, Yuji; Suhara, Tomohiro; Sonota, Kenji; Takauji, Shuhei; Takashima, Kohei; Takahashi, Sho; Takahashi, Yoko; Takeshita, Jun; Tanaka, Yuuki; Tampo, Akihito; Tsunoyama, Taichiro; Tetsuhara, Kenichi; Tokunaga, Kentaro; Tomioka, Yoshihiro; Tomita, Kentaro; Tominaga, Naoki; Toyosaki, Mitsunobu; Toyoda, Yukitoshi; Naito, Hiromichi; Nagata, Isao; Nagato, Tadashi; Nakamura, Yoshimi; Nakamori, Yuki; Nahara, Isao; Naraba, Hiromu; Narita, Chihiro; Nishioka, Norihiro; Nishimura, Tomoya; Nishiyama, Kei; Nomura, Tomohisa; Haga, Taiki; Hagiwara, Yoshihiro; Hashimoto, Katsuhiko; Hatachi, Takeshi; Hamasaki, Toshiaki; Hayashi, Takuya; Hayashi, Minoru; Hayamizu, Atsuki; Haraguchi, Go; Hirano, Yohei; Fujii, Ryo; Fujita, Motoki; Fujimura, Naoyuki; Funakoshi, Hiraku; Horiguchi, Masahito; Maki, Jun; Masunaga, Naohisa; Matsumura, Yosuke; Mayumi, Takuya; Minami, Keisuke; Miyazaki, Yuya; Miyamoto, Kazuyuki; Murata, Teppei; Yanai, Machi; Yano, Takao; Yamada, Kohei; Yamada, Naoki; Yamamoto, Tomonori; Yoshihiro, Shodai; Tanaka, Hiroshi; Nishida, Osamu",J Intensive Care,102,8

However, before surgery, the detailed analysis of the epilepsy localization area is an essential and logical step. The Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals from these areas are distinct and are referred to as focal, while the EEG signals from other normal areas are known as nonfocal. The visual inspection of multiple channels for detecting the focal EEG signal is time-consuming and prone to human error. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method based on differential operator and Tunable Q-factor wavelet transform (TQWT) to distinguish the focal and nonfocal signals. For this purpose, first, the EEG signal was differenced and then decomposed by TQWT. Second, several entropy-based features were derived from the TQWT subbands. Third, the efficacy of the six binary feature selection algorithms, binary bat algorithm (BBA), binary differential evolution (BDE) algorithm, firefly algorithm (FA), genetic algorithm (GA), grey wolf optimization (GWO), and particle swarm optimization (PSO), was evaluated. In the end, the selected features were fed to several machine learning and neural network classifiers. We observed that the PSO with neural networks provides an effective solution for the application of focal EEG signal detection. The proposed framework resulted in an average classification accuracy of 97.68%, a sensitivity of 97.26%, and a specificity of 98.11% in a tenfold cross-validation strategy, which is higher than the state of the art used in the public Bern-Barcelona EEG database.","Sadiq, Muhammad Tariq; Akbari, Hesam; Rehman, Ateeq Ur; Nishtar, Zuhaib; Masood, Bilal; Ghazvini, Mahdieh; Too, Jingwei; Hamedi, Nastaran; Kaabar, Mohammed K.

To address the structure-functional complexity of CYP2C8, its catalytic activity was studied using a directed evolution analysis. Consecutive rounds of random mutagenesis and screening using 6-methoxy-luciferin produced two mutants, which displayed highly increased luciferase activity. Wild-type and selected mutants were expressed on a large scale and purified. The expression levels of the D349Y and D349Y/V237A mutants were ~310 and 460 nmol per liter of culture, respectively. The steady-state kinetic analysis of paclitaxel 6α-hydroxylation showed that the mutants exhibited a 5–7-fold increase in k(cat) values and a 3–5-fold increase in catalytic efficiencies (k(cat)/K(M)). In arachidonic acid epoxidation, two mutants exhibited a 30–150-fold increase in k(cat) values and a 40–110-fold increase in catalytic efficiencies. The binding titration analyses of paclitaxel and arachidonic acid showed that the V237A mutation had a lower K(d) value, indicating a tighter substrate-binding affinity. The structural analysis of CYP2C8 indicated that the D349Y mutation was close enough to the putative binding domain of the redox partner; the increase in catalytic activity could be partially attributed to the enhancement of the P450 coupling efficiency or electron transfer.","Lee, Rowoon; Kim, Vitchan; Chun, Youngjin; Kim, Donghak",Pharmaceutics,102,1

The microRNA miR‐133a regulates cellular phenotypes and is reduced in clinical TAA specimens. This study tested the hypothesis that miR‐133a modulates aortic fibroblast phenotype, and overexpression by lentivirus attenuates the development of TAA in a murine model. METHODS AND RESULTS: TAA was induced in mice. Copy number of miR‐133a was reduced in TAA tissue and linear regression analysis confirmed an inverse correlation between aortic diameter and miR‐133a. Analyses of phenotypic markers revealed an mRNA expression profile consistent with myofibroblasts in TAA tissue. Fibroblasts were isolated from the thoracic aortae of mice with/without TAA. When compared with controls, miR‐133a was reduced, migration was increased, adhesion was reduced, and the ability to contract a collagen disk was increased. Overexpression/knockdown of miR‐133a controlled these phenotypes. After TAA induction in mice, a single tail‐vein injection of either miR‐133a overexpression or scrambled sequence (control) lentivirus was performed. Overexpression of miR‐133a attenuated TAA development. The pro‐protein convertase furin was confirmed to be a target of miR‐133a by luciferase reporter assay. Furin was elevated in this murine model of TAA and repressed by miR‐133a replacement in vivo resulting in reduced proteolytic activation. CONCLUSIONS: miR‐133a regulates aortic fibroblast phenotype and over‐expression prevented the development of TAA in a murine model. These findings suggest that stable alterations in aortic fibroblasts are associated with development of TAA and regulation by miR‐133a may lead to a novel therapeutic strategy.","Akerman, Adam W.; Collins, Elizabeth N.; Peterson, Andrew R.; Collins, Lauren B.; Harrison, Jessica K.; DeVaughn, Amari; Townsend, Jaleel M.; Vanbuskirk, Rebecca L.; Riopedre‐Maqueira, Jessica; Reyes, Ailet; Oh, Joyce E.; Raybuck, Charles M.; Jones, Jeffrey A.; Ikonomidis, John S.",J Am Heart Assoc,102,1

Lack of electronic access to medical records across health care organizations impedes interhospital consultation and may lead to incomplete and delayed referrals. To improve referral management, we have established a multidisciplinary neuro-oncological triage panel (NOTP) with digital image exchange and determined the effects on lead times, costs, and time investment. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted from February 2019 to March 2020. All newly diagnosed patients referred to Brain Tumor Center Amsterdam were analyzed according to referral pathway: (1) standard referral (SR), (2) NOTP. The primary outcome was lead time, defined as time-to-referral, time-to-treatment, and total time (median days [interquartile range]). Secondary outcomes were costs and time investment. RESULTS: In total, 225 patients were included, of whom 153 had SR and 72 NOTP referral. Patients discussed in the NOTP were referred more frequently for first neurosurgical consultation (44.7% vs 28.8%) or combined neurological and neurosurgical consultation (12.8% vs 2.5%, P = .002). Time-to-referral was reduced for NOTP referral compared to SR (1 [0.25-4] vs 6 [1.5-10] days, P < .001). Total time decreased from 27 [14-48] days for the standard group to 15 [12-38.25] days for the NOTP group (P = .040). Costs and time investment were comparable for both groups. CONCLUSION: Implementation of digital referral to a multidisciplinary NOTP is feasible and leads to more swift patient-tailored referrals at comparable costs and time investment as SR. This quality improvement initiative has the potential to improve collaboration and coordination of multidisciplinary care in the field of neuro-oncology.","de Swart, Merijn E; Kouwenhoven, Mathilde C M; Hellingman, Tessa; Kuiper, Babette I; Gorter de Vries, Cathelijne; Leembruggen-Vellinga, Machteld; Maliepaard, Niels K; Wouda, Ernest J; Moraal, Bastiaan; Noske, David P; Postma, Tjeerd J; Sanchez Aliaga, Esther; Uitdehaag, Bernard M J; Vandertop, William P; Zonderhuis, Barbara M; Kazemier, Geert; de Witt Hamer, Philip C; Schuur, Maaike",Neurooncol Pract,102,1

Although several large scale decontamination methods have been proposed (hydrogen peroxide vapor, UV-C); many of them are not applicable in remote and low-resource settings. Heat with humidity has been demonstrated as a promising decontamination approach, but care must be taken when implementing this method at a grassroots level. Here we present a simple, scalable method to provide controlled humidity and temperature for individual N95 respirators which is easily applicable in low-resource settings. N95 respirators were subjected to moist heat (>50% relative humidity, 65–80°C temperature) for over 30 minutes by placing them in a sealed container immersed in water that had been brought to a rolling boil and removed from heat, and then allowing the containers to sit for over 45 minutes. Filtration efficiency of 0.3–4.99 μm incense particles remained above 97% after 5 treatment cycles across all particle size sub-ranges. This method was then repeated at a higher ambient temperature and humidity in Mumbai, using standard utensils commonly found in South Asia. Similar temperature and humidity profiles were achieved with no degradation in filtration efficiencies after 6 cycles. Higher temperatures (>70°C) and longer treatment times (>40 minutes) were obtained by insulating the outer vessel. We also showed that the same method can be applied for the decontamination of surgical masks. This simple yet reliable method can be performed even without electricity access using any heat source to boil water, from open-flame stoves to solar heating, and provides a low-cost route for N95 decontamination globally applicable in resource-constrained settings.","Doshi, Siddharth; Banavar, Samhita P.; Flaum, Eliott; Kulkarni, Surendra; Vaidya, Ulhas; Kumar, Shailabh; Chen, Tyler; Bhattacharya, Arnab; Prakash, Manu",PLoS One,102,1

However, associations between rumination, SCI, presenteeism, and psychological well-being are not fully understood. We hypothesized that SCI and presenteeism mediate the associations between rumination and subjective well-being (SWB) and subjective ill-being (SIB). Hence, we investigated the mediating roles of SCI and presenteeism in this study. METHODS: A total of 458 adult workers (mean age, 40.8±11.9 years; 44.1% male), who were recruited in Tokyo using convenience sampling, were analyzed in this study. The Ruminative Responses Scale, Cognitive Complaints in Bipolar Disorder Rating Assessment, Work Limitations Questionnaire 8, and Subjective Well-being Inventory were used to evaluate rumination, SCI, presenteeism, and psychological well-being (SWB and SIB), respectively. Path analyses were performed to evaluate the relations between these parameters. RESULTS: The path analysis indicated that rumination, SCI, and presenteeism were directly and negatively associated with SWB and SIB. Regarding indirect effects, rumination was negatively associated with SWB and SIB via SCI, presenteeism, and both SCI and presenteeism. Furthermore, SCI was negatively associated with SWB and SIB via presenteeism. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that SCI and presenteeism mediate the associations of rumination with SWB and SIB in Japanese adult workers. To address the psychological well-being associated with rumination, evaluating SCI and presenteeism simultaneously may be useful in occupational mental health. This study provides key insights into the development of comprehensive intervention strategy based on the biopsychosocial perspective for worker’s psychological well-being.

However, studies comparing the NK(1)RAs in the class are lacking. A fixed combination of a highly selective NK(1)RA, netupitant, and the 5‐HT(3)RA, palonosetron (NEPA), simultaneously targets two critical antiemetic pathways, thereby offering a simple convenient antiemetic with long‐lasting protection from CINV. This study is the first head‐to‐head NK(1)RA comparative study in patients receiving anthracycline cyclophosphamide (AC) and non‐AC moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC).

The primary efficacy endpoint was complete response (no emesis/no rescue) during the overall (0–120 hour) phase. Noninferiority was achieved if the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the difference between NEPA and the aprepitant group was greater than the noninferiority margin set at −10%. RESULTS: Noninferiority of NEPA versus aprepitant was demonstrated (risk difference 9.2%; 95% CI, −2.3% to 20.7%); the overall complete response rate was numerically higher for NEPA (64.9%) than aprepitant (54.1%). Secondary endpoints also revealed numerically higher rates for NEPA than aprepitant. CONCLUSION: This pragmatic study in patients with cancer receiving AC and non‐AC MEC revealed that a single dose of oral NEPA plus DEX was at least as effective as a 3‐day aprepitant regimen, with indication of a potential efficacy benefit for NEPA. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: In the absence of comparative neurokinin 1 (NK(1)) receptor antagonist (RA) studies, guideline committees and clinicians consider NK(1)RA agents to be interchangeable and equivalent. This is the first head‐to‐head study comparing one NK(1)RA (oral netupitant/palonosetron [NEPA]) versus another (aprepitant) in patients receiving anthracycline cyclophosphamide (AC) and non‐AC moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. Noninferiority of NEPA versus the aprepitant regimen was demonstrated; the overall complete response (no emesis and no rescue use) rate was numerically higher for NEPA (65%) than aprepitant (54%). As a single‐dose combination antiemetic, NEPA not only simplifies dosing but may offer a potential efficacy benefit over the current standard‐of‐care.","Zelek, Laurent; Debourdeau, Philippe; Bourgeois, Hugues; Wagner, Jean Philippe; Brocard, Fabien; Lefeuvre‐Plesse, Claudia; Chauffert, Bruno; Leheurteur, Marianne; Bachet, Jean‐Baptiste; Simon, Hélène; Mayeur, Didier; Scotté, Florian",Oncologist,102,8

Students of vertebrate anatomy can especially benefit from practicing fabrication, or “making”, incorporating skills such as 3D digital modeling, 3D printing, and using familiar low-tech materials to construct informed replicas of animal anatomy. Student perceptions of active learning projects are shaped by motivation theories such as the expectancy-value theory and self-directed learning, both of which are briefly reviewed here. This paper offers inspiration and resources to instructors for establishing a makerspace in an anatomy lab and leveraging community partners to stimulate students to construct their own versions of nature's designs. Learning science in informal environments and specifically in makerspaces has been shown to promote equity and increase motivation to study science. Examples here emphasize accessibility for diverse learners, including strategies for instructors to ensure ease of student access to 3D technology. Scaffolding formative assessments builds student confidence and expertise, further closing opportunity gaps. Two specific cases are detailed where fabrication and the use of 3D digital models are used to augment student learning of vertebrate anatomy at a small liberal arts college. In a semester-long research project in an introductory biomechanics course, students investigate, write about, and build models of animal anatomy of their choice. They use simple materials, crafting supplies, household tools, and/or 3D printing to demonstrate structures of interest, enhancing understanding of the physical principles of animal form and function. Given increased availability of CT data online, students can download, analyze, and 3D print skeletal models of both common and endangered animals. Comparative anatomy students reported that they had increased motivation to study intricate skeletal anatomy simply by manipulating bones in a 3D software assignment. Students in both classes reported enjoying the use of fabrication in learning vertebrate anatomy and this may establish a pattern of lifelong learning.","Staab, Katie Lynn",Integr Comp Biol,102,8

Several studies have shown that a pathogen could be identified only in 50 to 60% of all patients, although in children < 6 month infectious agents can be detected in about 90%. Viral infections are most frequent in children < 2 years (80%), whereas bacterial infections increase with age. RSV, influenzaviruses, rhinoviruses, parainfluenzaviruses and adenoviruses are the most common viruses associated with CAP in children. Among adenoviruses a predominance of adenovirus 7 has been reported in several countries with emergence of highly pathogenic variants with significant lethality in young children. Many childhood respiratory infections are caused by more than one pathogen and up to 30% mixed viral / bacterial infections can be observed. CAP in immunocompetent adults is rare, whereas persons with underlaying diseases have an increased incidence of CAP. In the elderly, RSV, influenzaviruses, parainfluenzaviruses and less frequent adenoviruses are predominant viruses causing pneumonia. Less frequently associated with CAP are the newly discovered human metapneumovirus and the coronaviruses NL63 and HKU1. Hantaviruses, involved in the hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, belong to the emerging pathogens to date in North, Middle and South America. For optimum diagnosis the whole spectrum of potential respiratory viral agents should be included and multiple diagnostic techniques have to be used. In view of the high relevance of influenzavirus for CAP influenza vaccination is highly advisable for prevention of CAP, especially in high-risk groups.","Hampl, Walter; Mertens, Thomas",Community-Acquired Pneumonia,102,1

Indeed, surgery is a specialty born of warfare and will continue to drive advancements as mankind finds new and more lethal methods of combat. As hemorrhage is far and away the leading cause of potentially survivable death on the battlefield, the methods of resuscitation and blood transfusion continue to evolve. The critical role that blood plays in resuscitation of the critically injured patient was first explored during World War I for the treatment of ‘wound shock’. Type O whole blood was collected in sterile glass bottles containing citrate and transfused into patients prior to surgery. During the years following World War I, blood component fractionation became available, blood banking was initiated, and the transfusion of packed red blood cells (RBCs), fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and platelets became a mainstay of the trauma management paradigm. However, in times of war the variable availability of short-lived platelets, FFP, and cryoprecipitate inevitably leads back to the resurrection of fresh whole blood transfusion. Fresh whole blood, though not without some risk, restores the hemostatic mechanism and provides volume and oxygen-carrying capacity.","McMullin, N. R.; Holcomb, J.

The stress response is normally adaptive and time limited and improves the chances of the individual for survival. The stress response is mediated largely by activation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis with the release of cortisol. In general, there is a graded cortisol response to the degree of stress, such as the type of surgery. Cortisol levels also correlate with the severity of injury, the Glasgow Coma Scale, and the APACHE score. Cortisol effects the transcription of thousands of genes in every cell of the body. In addition, the cortisol–glucocorticoid receptor complex effects cellular function by non-transcriptional mechanisms. Cortisol has several important physiological actions on metabolism, cardiovascular function, and the immune system. Cortisol increases the synthesis of catecholamines and catecholamine receptors, which are partially responsible for its positive inotropic effects. In addition, cortisol has potent anti-inflammatory actions including the reduction in number and function of various immune cells, such as T and B lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils at sites of inflammation. Cortisol is the most important inhibitor of the transcription of pro-inflammatory mediators (inhibits NF-κB and AP-1 by multiple mechanisms).(1)","Marik, Paul Ellis",Handbook of Evidence-Based Critical Care,102,1

This is illustrated by the recent introduction and subsequent spread of West Nile virus in the USA, and outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in South-East Asia. It is therefore becoming increasingly important that national (and potentially regional) governments should not only have robust systems in place to reduce the risk of disease introductions, but that they need to also consider how to identify and deal with outbreaks of pathogens in wild and domestic animals. In this chapter we will discuss the roles of risk assessment and contingency planning in the management of exotic disease risks involving wild mammals. The principal purpose of contingency planning is to ensure that a State of preparedness exists in the event of a disease introduction. This requires that the most likely risks of pathogen introduction are identified, that there are adequate means of detecting the pathogen's presence, and that a set of instructions exists describing the best available methods for its rapid and cost-effective containment and control. Contingency planning will involve some of the approaches to disease surveillance (Chapter 10) and management (Chapters 6–8) discussed in other chapters, and so will entail many of the associated challenges, costs and benefits. However, as the aim of a contingency plan is likely to be the rapid containment and subsequent elimination of a pathogen (that is either exotic or endemic but emergent) within a restricted area, the methods of management should reflect this urgency. This may mean that it is appropriate to deploy more severe or costly measures over a short period than would be considered for the sustained control of an endemic pathogen.","Jackson, Vicky S.; Huntley, Selene; Tomlinson, Alex; Smith, Graham C.; Taylor, Mike A.; Delahay, Richard J.",Management of Disease in Wild Mammals,102,1

The removal of airborne particles, such as bacteria, allow for an improvement in indoor air quality so that our environment is healthy and pleasant. Within the medical field, illnesses caused by viruses such as influenza and SARS (2), hospital infections caused by airborne bacteria, fungi and allergic bronchial tube asthma (3), Japanese cedar hay fever caused by inhaling cedar pollen (4) are becoming large social concerns. In this research article, we discuss how we have applied our novel plasma discharge technology to produce positive and negative “cluster” ions. This iongenerating device operates at a normal atmospheric pressure. Subsequent investigations have permitted characterization of the resultant cluster ions.

Prompt quarantining of the infected from the rest, coupled with contact tracing, has been an effective measure to encounter outbreaks. However, urban life and international travel make containment difficult. Furthermore, the length of incubation periods of some contagious diseases like SARS enable infected passengers to elude health screenings before first symptoms appear and thus to carry the disease further. Detecting and visualizing contact–tracing networks, and immediately identifying the routes of infection, are thus important. We apply information visualization and hidden cluster detection for finding cliques of potentially infected people during incubation. Preemptive control and early quarantine are hence possible by our method.

In recent years, there has been a substantial improvement in the understanding of interstitial lung disease in pediatric patients due to the development of a structured classification system based on the etiology of the lung disease, established pathologic criteria for consistent diagnosis, and the improvement of thoracoscopic techniques for lung biopsy. Imaging plays an important role in evaluating interstitial lung diseases in infants and children by confirming and characterizing the disorder, generating differential diagnoses, and providing localization for lung biopsy for pathological diagnosis.

It seems clear that climate change will impact on waterborne pathogens in various ways (Rose et al. 2001), pertinent to transboundary issues are: (1) increases in intense storm events (increasing sewage/animal waste flows into waterways/aquifers) (Charron et al. 2004; Schijven and de Roda Husman 2005; Yang and Goodrich 2009; De Toffol et al. 2009; Richardson et al. 2009); (2) warmer surface water temperatures or salinity changes (for increased autochthonous pathogen growth) (Niemi et al. 2004; Koelle et al. 2005; Lebarbenchon et al. 2008); and (3) changes in food production, as most obvious in animal diseases (Lightner et al. 1997; Rapoport and Shimshony 1997), but also of concern with zoonoses and from changes in social behavior (Schwab et al. 1998; Nancarrow et al. 2008; CDC 2009a). When considering trans-boundary effects on waterborne pathogens, it is therefore the flow of pathogens in surface water (fresh and marine) and in groundwater, as well as in the varying ways water is used/reused in association with human activities (e.g., food production) that are the trans-boundary issues discussed in this chapter (examples in Table 5.1).

Since then, numerous reports have described the detection of hMPV in clinical specimens from children, adults and the elderly (both immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients), diagnosed with an acute respiratory illness all over the world. hMPV is associated with a substantial number of respiratory tract infections in otherwise healthy children, with clinical illnesses similar to those associated with other common respiratory viruses. Serological surveys have shown that hMPV is a ubiquitous virus that infects all children by the age of 5–10 years and has been circulating in humans for at least 50 years. hMPV is a member of the Metapneumovirus genus of the Paramyxoviridae family, a group of negative-stranded RNA viruses. Genetic studies on hMPV have demonstrated the presence of two distinct hMPV serotypes each divided in two subgroups. Diagnosis is made by RT-PCR assays on respiratory secretions. Rapid antigen detection tests are not yet available and its growth in cell cultures is fastidious. No vaccines, antibodies (monoclonal or polyclonal), or chemotherapeutic agents are currently licensed for use to prevent or treat hMPV infections. The contribution of hMPV to pediatric respiratory tract infections suggests that it will be important to develop a vaccine against this virus in combination with those being developed for RSV and parainfluenza viruses. Reverse genetics technology is currently used to develop multivalent vaccines against hMPV and a variety of other important respiratory viruses such as RSV. Additional research to define the pathogenesis of this viral infection and the host’ specific immune response will enhance our knowledge to guide the search for preventive and therapeutical strategies.","Warris, Adilia; de Groot, Ronald",Pediatric Infectious Diseases Revisited,102,22

This article reviews empirical uses of communications technology in humanitarian and pandemic response, and the 2014 Ebola response in particular, in order to propose a three-part conceptual model for the new informatics of pandemic response. This model distinguishes between the use of digital communication tools for diagnostic, risk communication, and coordination activities and highlights how the influx of novel actors and tendencies towards digital and operational convergence risks focusing humanitarian action and decision-making outside national authorities’ spheres of influence in pandemic response. This risk exacerbates a fundamental tension between the humanitarian promise of new technologies and the fundamental norm that international humanitarian response should complement and give primacy to the role of national authorities when possible. The article closes with recommendations for ensuring the inclusion of roles and agency for national authorities in technology-supported communication processes for pandemic response.","Wilson, Christopher; Jumbert, Maria Gabrielsen",,102,1

All apes are endangered. Pathologists contribute to their conservation through understanding diseases affecting both managed and free-living populations. Apes are susceptible to many of the same diseases as humans and other nonhuman primates. Trauma and infectious diseases, such as Ebola, respiratory infections and parasitism affect apes in range countries. Respiratory and gastrointestinal infections are also important in wild as well as captive populations. Degenerative diseases of older age, especially cardiovascular disease and renal disease, are more important in zoo-housed apes than in their wild counterparts. Infections described only in zoo-housed apes include coccidiodomycosis, tularemia, dysentery due to balantidiasis, and systemic amoebiasis due to balamuthia. Those reported only in apes in range countries include yaws, leprosy, Ebola, anthrax-like bacillary septicemia, and gapeworms.","Lowenstine, Linda J.; McManamon, Rita; Terio, Karen A.",Pathology of Wildlife and Zoo Animals,102,5

Although the Holland Code also known as RIASEC has frequently been used to group people by their suitability for six different categories of occupations, the RIASEC category labels of individual jobs are often not found in job posts. This is attributed to significant manual efforts required for assigning job posts with RIASEC labels. To cope with assigning massive number of jobs with RIASEC labels, we propose JPLink, a machine learning approach using the text content in job titles and job descriptions. JPLink exploits domain knowledge available in an occupation-specific knowledge base known as O*NET to improve feature representation of job posts. To incorporate relative ranking of RIASEC labels of each job, JPLink proposes a listwise loss function inspired by learning to rank. Both our quantitative and qualitative evaluations show that JPLink outperforms conventional baselines. We conduct an error analysis on JPLink’s predictions to show that it can uncover label errors in existing job posts.","Silva, Amila; Lo, Pei-Chi; Lim, Ee-Peng",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,102,1

With increasing automation, autonomous agents are expected to take over a lot of this interaction process. Much of automated negotiation literature focuses on agents having a static and known reservation value. In situations involving dynamic environments e.g., an agent negotiating on behalf of a human regarding a meeting, agents can have a reservation value (RV) that is a function of time. This leads to a different set of challenges that may need additional reasoning about the concession behavior. In this paper, we build upon Negotiation algorithms such as ONAC (Optimal Non-Adaptive Concession) and Time-Dependent Techniques such as Boulware which work on settings where the reservation value of the agent is fixed and known. Although these algorithms can encode dynamic RV, their concession behavior and hence the properties they were expected to display would be different from when the RV is static, even though the underlying negotiation algorithm remains the same. We, therefore, propose to use one of Counter, Bayesian Learning with Regression Analysis or LSTM model on top of each algorithm to develop the PredictRV strategy and show that PredictRV indeed performs better on two different metrics tested on two different domains on a variety of parameter settings.","Gear, Aditya Srinivas; Prakash, Kritika; Singh, Nonidh; Paruchuri, Praveen",Group Decision and Negotiation: A Multidisciplinary Perspective,102,1

It boosts the discovery, selection and composition of services and information provided by distributed objects. In SIoT, searching for services is based on the utilization of the social structure resulted from the formed relationships. However, current approaches lack modelling and effective analysis of SIoT. In this work, we address this problem and specifically focus on modelling the SIoT’s evolvement. As the growing number of IoT objects with heterogeneous attributes join the social network, there is an urgent need for identifying the mechanisms by which SIoT structures evolve. We model the SIoT over time and address the suitability of traditional analytical procedures to predict future relationships (links) in the dynamic and heterogeneous SIoT. Specifically, we propose a framework, namely SIoTPredict, which includes three stages: i) collection of raw movement data of IoT devices, ii) generating temporal sequence networks of the SIoT, and iii) predicting relationships among IoT devices which are likely to occur. We have conducted extensive experimental studies to evaluate the proposed framework using real SIoT datasets and the results show the better performance of our framework.","Aljubairy, Abdulwahab; Zhang, Wei Emma; Sheng, Quan Z.; Alhazmi, Ahoud",Advanced Information Systems Engineering,102,1

Healthcare-associated ventriculitis and meningitis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Complications of healthcare-associated ventriculitis and meningitis include persistent vegetative state, moderate and severe disability, and death. Acinetobacter baumannii is the causative pathogen in 3.6–11.2% of cases of healthcare-associated ventriculitis and meningitis. Cases of difficult-to-treat healthcare-associated A. baumannii ventriculitis and meningitis are being reported more frequently. However, in most of these cases, a combination of intravenous (IV) and intraventricular (IVT)/intrathecal colistin achieves good therapeutic outcome. This report describes a clinical case of difficult-to-treat healthcare-associated A. baumannii ventriculitis. The A. baumannii strain was sensitive to colistin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, intermediate to tigecycline, and resistant to other antibiotics. While colistin was the drug of choice in our case, the patient developed anaphylactoid reaction during the IV administration of the loading dose of colistin, which mandated us to discontinue colistin and complicated the treatment of our patient. The patient did not respond to a combination of IV antibiotics that included meropenem, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and tigecycline. However, when IVT tigecycline was added as a last-resort therapeutic option, the patient’s ventriculitis dramatically improved, and the patient was discharged from the hospital. Physicians who treat patients with healthcare-associated A. baumannii ventriculitis might resort to IVT tigecycline when they run out of therapeutic options.","Abdallah, Mohammad; Alsaleh, Hamzeh; Baradwan, Abdallah; Alfawares, Reem; Alobaid, Abdulaziz; Rasheed, Akram; Soliman, Ibrahim",SN Compr Clin Med,102,1

This co-infection has been described in patients requiring treatment in an intensive care unit. The risk factors for its development are still unclear. METHODS: We conducted a nested case-control study using the COVID-19 registry of the ARMII study group, based in the Centro Médico ABC, a private hospital in Mexico City. We included all patients that required admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) from March 12 to June 15, 2020, and excluded patients without serum galactomannan measurements or bronchial secretion cultures. We used the modified definition of IPA proposed by Schauwvlieghe et al for IPA in influenza patients. The control group was formed by patients with ruled-out IPA (negative galactomannan and secretion cultures). We compared both groups to identify risk factors for IPA using the chi-squared test or the Mann-Whitney U test as applicable. RESULTS: Out of a total 239 patients, 54 met the inclusion criteria. We identified 13 patients with IPA (24.07%) that met the definition of IPA (2 with positive cultures and 11 with positive galactomannan) and 41 without IPA. Only three patients with IPA had important comorbidities (COPD, chronic kidney disease, and HIV). Patients with IPA tended to have a higher median age (64.6 vs 53.59, p=0.075) and a higher serum glucose at their arrival (145 vs 119, p=0.028). All patients with IPA presented to the hospital with ARDS (100% vs 72.5%, p=0.034), but ultimately did not have a higher requirement for mechanical ventilation (100% vs 82.93%, p=0.110). There were no statistical significant differences in use of Tocilizumab, use of glucocorticoids, mortality (23.07% vs 17.50%, p=0.563) or length of stay. CONCLUSION: It has been previously described that patients with acute respiratory disease syndrome triggered by viral infection, like the influenza virus, are prone to invasive aspergillosis even in the absence of underlying immunodeficiency. The use of antifungals to prevent aspergillosis in COVID-19 patients should be assessed because of the gravity presented in the patients with this co-infection.

To keep software verification tools up to date with these advances, tool developers keep on integrating newly designed methods into their tools, almost exclusively by re-implementing the method within their own framework. While this allows for a conceptual re-use of methods, it nevertheless requires novel implementations for every new technique. In this paper, we employ cooperative verification in order to avoid re-implementation and enable usage of novel tools as black-box components in verification. Specifically, cooperation is employed for the core ingredient of software verification which is invariant generation. Finding an adequate loop invariant is key to the success of a verification run. Our framework named CoVEGI allows a master verification tool to delegate the task of invariant generation to one or several specialized helper invariant generators. Their results are then utilized within the verification run of the master verifier, allowing in particular for crosschecking the validity of the invariant. We experimentally evaluate our framework on an instance with two masters and three different invariant generators using a number of benchmarks from SV-COMP 2020. The experiments show that the use of CoVEGI can increase the number of correctly verified tasks without increasing the used resources.","Haltermann, Jan; Wehrheim, Heike",Fundamental Approaches to Software Engineering,102,16

We deal with the potential endogeneity between private investment and other macroeconomic determinants by applying an instrumental variable approach (GMM). Our results support the debt overhang hypothesis and indicate that this relationship only works through the public debt channel. In our baseline regression, a 10 percentage point increase in public debt reduced private investment by €18.32 billion, given the levels of private investment prevalent in 2016. By contrast, private debt does not appear to be a significant determinant of private investment. These results hold after controlling for a number of factors that might have caused public debt to increase and private investment to decrease. While our analysis focuses on the financial sector channel, we find no evidence that public debt tightens the credit constraints for private firms or worsens the public debt overhang. We also show that government bailouts of the financial sector, which could alleviate financial distress and boost credit provision, do not appear to be effective in mitigating the public debt overhang effect. Finally, we find evidence that the financial openness of a country does alleviate the negative impact of public debt on private investment. This might suggest that attracting foreign capital compensates for a contraction in the domestic pool of financial resources due to higher public debt levels.","Vanlaer, Willem; Picarelli, Mattia; Marneffe, Wim",Open Econ Rev,102,13

The rise of this concept can be linked to the recognition of the specificity of problems related to the insolvency of multinational enterprise groups, arising from group operational and financial interconnectedness. This has not happened at once, but has resulted from the evolution of views and ideas, evident in hard and soft law instruments of the 2000s and the 2010s. In light of this important development the article explores the concept of a group solution, its rationale, scope of application and limitations. It concludes that despite the gradual acceptance of the group phenomenon, a group solution has not been formed as a coherent and well-defined legal principle. Instead, it represents a variety of approaches, tools and practices, which pursue different policy objectives underpinned by different societal values. Among them are asset value maximization, business rescue, the protection of financial stability and the preservation of banks’ critical functions. With all its flexibility, a group solution has one pervasive limitation—it cannot trump the interests of individual group members and their creditors. At the same time, in order to realize the full potential of a group solution, it is necessary to embrace the group-sensitive and forward-looking interpretation of creditors’ interest, facilitating commercially sensible and practical group solutions.","Kokorin, Ilya",Eur Bus Org Law Rev,102,30

In this study, we aimed to investigate the impact of implementing the use of logic and mathematics through digital literacy on a population of elementary school students in a town in Northeast Brazil. In a non-randomized experimental longitudinal intervention study, 5th-grade students were followed during one semester. They underwent observational testing during class with the use of scales to evaluate their activities in a digital environment, and they were evaluated with respect to their ability to use digital devices. A logic/math assessment was applied prior to and at the end of the course for intervention group and compared to a control group. Questionnaires were used to assess the educators', legal guardians' and students’ perceptions on digital habits and their respective sociodemographic features. The intervention consisted of a 16-h long course developed consisting of 8 2-h long classes which focused on digital technology, digital culture, and computational thinking. The students had a strong interest in the classes. Although some students did not have prior contact with computers, their development was outstanding. Digital literacy competencies and technology-use behavior increased throughout the semester independent of family income and use of digital devices at home. Students progressively improved their interaction with the computer (e.g. touchpad and typing skills) and their confidence in the digital environment. Students’ scores on the logic/math assessment showed significant improvement. This was not observed in the control group, demonstrating the importance of this type of intervention even with one provided by a 16-h course.

Imposed delays to arthroplasty during coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic have led us to postulate that many patients have opted for recent ICSI. We compared the odds of prosthetic joint infection (PJI) in patients who were or were not administered ICSI within 12 months prior to hip or knee arthroplasty. A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, The Cochrane Library and Web of Science was performed in February 2021, with studies assessing the effect of ICS on PJI rates identified. All studies, which included patients that received ICSI in the 12 months prior to primary hip and knee arthroplasty, were included. In total 12 studies were included: four studies with 209 353 hips and eight studies with 438 440 knees. ICSI administered in the 12 months prior to hip arthroplasty increased the odds of PJI [odds ratio (OR) = 1.17, P = 0.04]. This was not the case for knees. Subgroup analysis showed significantly higher odds of PJI in both hip [OR = 1.45, P = 0.002] and knee arthroplasty [OR = 2.04; P = 0.04] when ICSI was within the preceding 3 months of surgery. A significantly higher odds of PJI were seen in patients receiving ICSI within the 12 months prior to hip arthroplasty. Subgroup analysis showed increased odds of PJI in both hip and knee arthroplasty, in patients receiving ICSI within 3 months prior to their arthroplasty. We recommend delaying knee arthroplasty for at least 3 months after ICSI and possibly longer for hip arthroplasty.

The aim of this cross-sectional study was to estimate the prevalence and to determine some associated factors of ED among a sample of adult Egyptian male patients with T2DM. METHODS This cross-sectional study included 150 adult male patients with T2DM (aged 40-60 years) who attended the outpatient clinic of Diabetes in Alexandria Main University hospital. They were evaluated for the presence of ED which was assessed by the validated Arabic-translated five-item version of the International Index of Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5) questionnaire. Fasting blood glucose (FBG), HbA1c, total serum cholesterol, HDL-C, total serum testosterone (TT) and urinary albumin creatinine ratio (uACR) were measured for all study subjects. RESULTS The prevalence of ED was 80% among the studied sample. Significant negative correlation was found between IIEF-5 score and age, duration of diabetes, FBG and urinary ACR; while there was a significant positive correlation between IIEF-5 score and serum total testosterone. On performing multiple linear regression analysis for the parameters affecting IIEF-5 questionnaire score, TT, urinary ACR, age and FBG were the independent predictors of ED. CONCLUSION ED was a common finding in our sample of Egyptian men with T2DM.

Little is known about the food insecurity status in the north of Iran. AIM The present study aimed to investigate the food insecurity status and factors associated with it in a rural area in the north of Iran. METHODS This cross-sectional study was conducted among 573 rural households in Guilan Province in the north of Iran. The food insecurity status of the households was measured using the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale. Data on the demographic characteristics of the households and their depression status were collected by interviewing the heads of the households. The socioeconomic status index of the households was constructed using factor analysis, and a multivariate ordinal logistic regression model was used to estimate the adjusted odds ratio of the independent predictors of food insecurity. RESULTS The results indicated that approximately half of the households (50.8%) had experienced mild (43.2%), moderate (6.5%) or severe (1.1%) food insecurity. The multivariate model showed that sex, age, depression status of the head of the household and having a patient with a chronic condition in the household were independently associated with food security status. CONCLUSIONS This study showed that food insecurity was highly prevalent among rural households in the north of Iran. The study concludes that interventions with the aim of reducing the prevalence of food insecurity, depression and chronic diseases in the area can be effective in improving the nutritional status of the households.","Shakiba, Maryam; Salari, Arsalan; Mahdavi-Roshan, Marjan",Nutrition and health,102,16

While collaboration between organizations provides a unique opportunity to pool resources and save time and effort, the collaboration presents its own unique challenges. OBJECTIVE To assess the perceived needs and current challenges of guideline producers worldwide related to guideline development and collaboration efforts. DESIGN Survey questions were developed by the Guidelines International Network and the US GRADE Network, pilot-tested among attendees of a guideline development workshop, and disseminated electronically using convenience and snowball sampling methods. PARTICIPANTS A total of 171 respondents representing 30 countries and more than 112 unique organizations were included in this analysis. MAIN MEASURES The survey included free-response, multiple-choice, and seven-point Likert-scale questions. Questions assessed respondents' perceived value of guidelines, resource availability and needs, guideline development processes, and collaboration efforts of their organization. KEY RESULTS Time required to develop high-quality systematic reviews and guidelines was the most relevant need (median=7; IQR=5.5-7). In-house resources to conduct literature searches (median=4; IQR=3-6) and the resources to develop rigorous guidelines rapidly (median=4; IQR=2-5) were perceived as the least available resources. Difficulties reconciling differences in guideline methodology (median=6; IQR=4-7) and the time required to establish collaborative agreements (median=6; IQR=5-6) were the most relevant barriers to collaboration between organizations. Results also indicated a general need for improvement in conflict of interest (COI) disclosure policies. CONCLUSION The survey identified organizational challenges in supporting rigorous guideline development, including the time, resources, and personnel required. Connecting guideline developers to existing databases of high-quality systematic reviews and the use of freely available online platforms may facilitate guideline development. Guideline-producing organizations may also consider allocating resources to hiring or training personnel with expertise in systematic review methodologies or utilizing resources more effectively by establishing collaborations with other organizations.","Sultan, Shahnaz; Siedler, Madelin R; Morgan, Rebecca L; Ogunremi, Toju; Dahm, Philipp; Fatheree, Lisa A; Getchius, Thomas S D; Ginex, Pamela K; Jakhmola, Priya; McFarlane, Emma; Murad, M Hassan; Temple Smolkin, Robyn L; Amer, Yasser S; Alam, Murad; Kang, Bianca Y; Falck-Ytter, Yngve; Mustafa, Reem A",Journal of general internal medicine,102,30

CMV DNA and protein were detected using polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry, along with routine autopsy of stillborn infants. RESULTS Overall, CMV DNA was detected in 15% of singleton, >20-week stillborn infants. CMV DNA was detected in kidney (9%), liver (11%), and placenta (5%) specimens, with 75% of infections confirmed by immunohistochemistry.

An online survey, comprising demographic questions and questionnaires on depression, anxiety and loneliness symptoms, was distributed in Canada during the height of social distancing restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Respondents (N=661) from lower income households experienced greater anxiety, depression and loneliness. Specifically, loneliness was greater in those with an annual income <$50,000/yr versus higher income brackets. Younger females (18-29yr) displayed greater anxiety, depressive symptoms and loneliness than their male counterparts; this difference did not exist among the other age groups (30-64yr, >65yr). Moreover, loneliness scores increased with increasing depression and anxiety symptom severity category. The relationship between loneliness and depression symptoms was moderated by gender, such that females experienced higher depressive symptoms when encountering greater loneliness. These data identify younger females, individuals with lower income, and those living alone as experiencing greater loneliness and mental health challenges during the height of the pandemic in Canada.

In order to cope with green analytical chemistry principles and the trending development of miniaturized portable and handheld devices, an innovative microfabricated ion-selective electrode for the analysis of metoclopramide (MTP) was developed. The fabricated electrode adopted a two-step optimization process. The first step of optimization depended on screening different ionophores in order to enhance the sensor selectivity. Calix-4-arene showed the maximal selectivity towards MTP. The second step was utilizing a graphene nanocomposite as an ion-to-electron transducer layer between the calix-4-arene polymeric membrane and the microfabricated copper solid-contact ion-selective electrode. The graphene nanocomposite layer added more stability to electrode potential drift and short response times (10 s), probably due to the hydrophobic behavior of the graphene nanocomposite, which precludes the formation of a water layer at the Cu electrode/polymeric membrane interface. The proposed MTP sensor has been characterized according to IUPAC recommendations and the linear dynamic range estimated to be 1 × 10-6 to 1 × 10-2 M with LOD of 3 × 10-7 M. The proposed sensor has been successfully employed in the selective determination of MTP in bulk powder, pharmaceutical formulation, and biological fluid.

Following National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidance for faecal immunochemical testing (FIT) (DG30), we introduced a service for the measurement of faecal haemoglobin (fHb) in symptomatic patients in line with the 2017 update of the NG12 guidance. The purpose of this study was to audit the use of FIT, focussing on the indication for request and referral for diagnostic tests as recommended in NICE guidance. METHODS Testing was rolled out after careful introduction with extensive education led by the local Cancer Alliance and reinforced by the laboratory. After 6 months, the outcomes of all patients tested were reviewed. RESULTS 1203 samples were received, of which 894 (74.3%) were suitable for analysis. Of these, 482 (53.9%) actually met the criteria for FIT analysis stipulated in our patient pathway. Eight patients were diagnosed with CRC; fHb was detectable in all and was ≥200 µg/g in seven and <10 µg/g in one. 217 patients underwent gastrointestinal investigations, and the sensitivity and specificity of FIT for CRC were found to be 87.5% (95% CI 46.6% to 99.7%) and 52.6% (95% CI 45.6% to 59.6%), respectively. Patients with anaemia were more likely to have fHb ≥10 µg/g. CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest benefits from the introduction of FIT in terms of more efficient use of diagnostic investigations, while revealing initial problems relating to familiarity with a new test. This merits further intervention with education and awareness programmes for Primary Care and further audit.","Ayling, Ruth M; Machesney, Michael",Journal of clinical pathology,102,31

Although adhesion formation is the most frequent complication in abdominal and pelvic surgery, many surgeons are still not aware of the extent of the problem. To provide the best care for their patients, surgeons should consistently inform themselves of anti-adhesion strategies and include these methods in their daily routine. METHODS Searches were conducted in PubMed and The Cochrane Library to identify relevant literature. FINDINGS Various complications are associated with adhesion formation, including small bowel obstruction, infertility and chronic pelvic pain. Increasingly, an understanding of adhesion formation as a complex process influenced by many different factors has led to various conceivable anti-adhesion strategies. At present, a number of different anti-adhesion agents are available. Although some agents have proved effective in reducing adhesion formation in randomised controlled trials, none of them can completely prevent adhesion formation. CONCLUSION To fulfil our duty to provide best possible care for our patients, it is now time to regard adhesions as the most common complication in surgery. Further research is needed to fully understand adhesion formation and to develop new strategies for adhesion prevention. Large clinical efficacy trials of anti-adhesion agents will make it easier for surgeons to decide which agent to use in daily routine.","Hirschelmann, Anja; Tchartchian, Garri; Wallwiener, Markus; Hackethal, Andreas; De Wilde, Rudy Leon",Archives of gynecology and obstetrics,102,30

All single incision bands were placed using the Covidien SILS Port™ and the Allergan Lap-Band(®). The purpose of the present study was to report on the analgesic use after single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) adjustable gastric banding versus that after conventional laparoscopic gastric banding at a community hospital. METHODS A retrospective review of postoperative pain medication use and the time to return to work was conducted of 24 consecutive SILS adjustable gastric banding procedures compared with 24 traditional 5-incision laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding procedures. RESULTS The patients in both groups were evenly matched for age, body mass index, and co-morbidities. All patients were discharged home on postoperative day 1. No complications developed. The mean patient-controlled analgesia morphine use during hospitalization for the SILS group was 33 ± 19.22 mg versus 49 ± 23.78 mg in the traditional group (P <.05). The mean period of postoperative pain medication use for the SILS group was 2 days versus 5 days for the traditional group (P <.05). However, the mean period to return to work was 9.5 days for the SILS group versus 11 days for the traditional group (P = NS). CONCLUSION Transumbilical single-incision laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding with mechanical port fixation resulted in significantly decreased postoperative pain medication use compared with traditional laparoscopic gastric banding with suture fixation of the band port. Also, the patients tended to return to work earlier after SILS gastric banding.","Raman, Shankar R; Franco, Donna; Holover, Spencer; Garber, Shawn",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,102,0

Though best-known for its application in tumor therapy, historically the photodynamic effect was first demonstrated against bacteria at the beginning of the 20th century. Today, in light of spreading antibiotic resistance and the rise of new infections, this photodynamic inactivation (PDI) of microbes, such as bacteria, fungi, and viruses, is gaining considerable attention. This review focuses on the PDI of viruses as an alternative treatment in antiviral therapy, but also as a means of viral decontamination, covering mainly the literature of the last decade. The PDI of viruses shares the general action mechanism of photodynamic applications: the irradiation of a dye with light and the subsequent generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which are the effective phototoxic agents damaging virus targets by reacting with viral nucleic acids, lipids and proteins. Interestingly, a light-independent antiviral activity has also been found for some of these dyes. This review covers the compound classes employed in the PDI of viruses and their various areas of use. In the medical area, currently two fields stand out in which the PDI of viruses has found broader application: the purification of blood products and the treatment of human papilloma virus manifestations. However, the PDI of viruses has also found interest in such diverse areas as water and surface decontamination, and biosafety.","Wiehe, Arno; O'Brien, Jessica M; Senge, Mathias O",Photochemical & photobiological sciences : Official journal of the European Photochemistry Association and the European Society for Photobiology,102,17

Our objective was to develop an outcome score that clinicians could easily calculate at the bedside to predict the risk of death of acute respiratory distress syndrome patients 24 hours after diagnosis. DESIGN A prospective, multicenter, observational, descriptive, and validation study. SETTING A network of multidisciplinary ICUs. PATIENTS Six-hundred patients meeting Berlin criteria for moderate and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome enrolled in two independent cohorts treated with lung-protective ventilation. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Using individual demographic, pulmonary, and systemic data at 24 hours after acute respiratory distress syndrome diagnosis, we derived our prediction score in 300 acute respiratory distress syndrome patients based on stratification of variable values into tertiles, and validated in an independent cohort of 300 acute respiratory distress syndrome patients. Primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. We found that a 9-point score based on patient's age, PaO2/FIO2 ratio, and plateau pressure at 24 hours after acute respiratory distress syndrome diagnosis was associated with death. Patients with a score greater than 7 had a mortality of 83.3% (relative risk, 5.7; 95% CI, 3.0-11.0), whereas patients with scores less than 5 had a mortality of 14.5% (p < 0.0000001). We confirmed the predictive validity of the score in a validation cohort. CONCLUSIONS A simple 9-point score based on the values of age, PaO2/FIO2 ratio, and plateau pressure calculated at 24 hours on protective ventilation after acute respiratory distress syndrome diagnosis could be used in real time for rating prognosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome patients with high probability.","Villar, Jesús; Ambrós, Alfonso; Soler, Juan Alfonso; Martínez, Domingo; Ferrando, Carlos; Solano, Rosario; Mosteiro, Fernando; Blanco, Jesús; Martín-Rodríguez, Carmen; Fernández, María Del Mar; López, Julia; Díaz-Domínguez, Francisco J; Andaluz-Ojeda, David; Merayo, Eleuterio; Pérez-Méndez, Lina; Fernández, Rosa Lidia; Kacmarek, Robert M",Critical care medicine,102,16

The extent to which reactivation of certain developmental pathways in the adult might influence the course of differentiation of alveolar type 2 cells (AT2) into AT1 cells is not known. In this study, we examined selected members of the forkhead (Fox) family of transcription factors and the Wnt (wingless) family of signaling proteins for expression during human alveolar cell differentiation in vitro and determined their potential responses to sulfated components of extracellular matrix (ECM), like those shed from cell surfaces or found in basement membrane and modeled by heparin. Isolated adult human AT2 cells cultured over a 9-day period were used to define the temporal profile of expression of targeted factors during spontaneous differentiation to AT1-like cells. FoxA1 protein was upregulated at early to intermediate time points, where it was strongly elevated by heparin. Gene expression of wnt7A increased dramatically beginning on day 3 and was enhanced even further on days 7 and 9 by heparin, whereas protein expression appeared at days 7 and 9. These temporal changes of expression suggest that sulfated ECMs may act to enhance the increase in FoxA1 at the critical juncture when AT2 cells commence the differentiation process to AT1 cells, in addition to enhancing the increase in wnt7A when the AT1 cell phenotype stabilizes. Collectively, these factors may act to modulate differentiation in the adult human pulmonary alveolus.","Apparao, K B C; Newman, Donna R; Zhang, Huiying; Khosla, Jody; Randell, Scott H; Sannes, Philip L",Anatomical record,102,24

Leventhal's self-regulation educational model is based on the cognitive and emotional experiences of threat responses to symptoms and relates to coping responses. This study aims to investigate the effect of the implementation of a psychoeducational intervention, based on the self-regulation model of menstrual distress in adolescents. METHODS/DESIGN In this randomized controlled trial, 120 adolescent girls with moderate to severe menstrual pain (based on visual analog scale (VAS) ≥ 4) from twelve randomly selected high schools in Qazvin City will be enrolled in the study and will be randomly assigned to either a 3-session psychoeducational intervention (n = 60) or control (n = 60) groups. The sessions will be between 60 and 90 min apiece, and they will run for three consecutive weeks (one session per week). The data collection tools will include questionnaire eliciting menstrual information and demographics, the VAS, the Moos Menstrual Distress Questionnaire, and the illness perception questionnaire. One month prior to the intervention, both groups will participate in an initial assessment to assess the severity of their pain and level of menstrual distress. Finally, all questionnaires will be completed for three consecutive months after the intervention is completed. DISCUSSION It is anticipated that findings of this study will provide evidence for the effectiveness of the Leventhal self-regulation model. Implications for improved practice, understanding, and treatment for menstrual distress may also arise.

Peripheral arterial diseases, neuropathy, and infection contribute to the development of these wounds, which lead to an increased incidence of lower extremity amputations. Early recognition, debridement, offloading, and controlling infection are imperative for timely treatment. However, wound characterization and treatment are highly subjective and based largely on the experience of the treating clinician. Many wound dressings have been designed to address particular clinical presentations, but a prescriptive method is lacking for identifying the particular state of chronic, non-healing wounds. The authors suggest that recent developments in wound dressings and biosensing may allow for the quantitative, real-time representation of the wound environment, including exudate levels, pathogen concentrations, and tissue regeneration. Development of such sensing capability could enable more strategic, personalized care at the onset of ulceration and limit the infection leading to amputation. This review presents an overview of the pathophysiology of diabetic chronic wounds, a brief summary of biomaterial wound dressing treatment options, and biosensor development for biomarker sensing in the wound environment.","Gianino, Elizabeth; Miller, Craig; Gilmore, Jordon",Bioengineering,102,31

The concept of virtual patient evaluation has previously been adopted across a range of medical and surgical specialities yielding safe and efficient pathways associated with good Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) and patient satisfaction rates.

Here, we analyse the supply-chain effects of a set of idealized lockdown scenarios, using the latest global trade modelling framework. We find that supply-chain losses that are related to initial COVID-19 lockdowns are largely dependent on the number of countries imposing restrictions and that losses are more sensitive to the duration of a lockdown than its strictness. However, a longer containment that can eradicate the disease imposes a smaller loss than shorter ones. Earlier, stricter and shorter lockdowns can minimize overall losses. A 'go-slow' approach to lifting restrictions may reduce overall damages if it avoids the need for further lockdowns. Regardless of the strategy, the complexity of global supply chains will magnify losses beyond the direct effects of COVID-19. Thus, pandemic control is a public good that requires collective efforts and support to lower-capacity countries.","Guan, Dabo; Wang, Daoping; Hallegatte, Stephane; Davis, Steven J; Huo, Jingwen; Li, Shuping; Bai, Yangchun; Lei, Tianyang; Xue, Qianyu; Coffman, D'Maris; Cheng, Danyang; Chen, Peipei; Liang, Xi; Xu, Bing; Lu, Xiaosheng; Wang, Shouyang; Hubacek, Klaus; Gong, Peng",Nature human behaviour,102,16

Chest computed Tomography (CT) has proven to be a useful supplement to reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and has been shown to have high sensitivity to diagnose this condition. Therefore, radiological examinations are becoming crucial in early examination of COVID-19 infection. Currently, CT findings have already been suggested as an important evidence for scientific examination of COVID-19 in Hubei, China. However, classification of patient from chest CT images is not an easy task. Therefore, in this paper, a deep bidirectional long short-term memory network with mixture density network (DBM) model is proposed. To tune the hyperparameters of the DBM model, a Memetic Adaptive Differential Evolution (MADE) algorithm is used. Extensive experiments are drawn by considering the benchmark chest-Computed Tomography (chest-CT) images datasets. Comparative analysis reveals that the proposed MADE-DBM model outperforms the competitive COVID-19 classification approaches in terms of various performance metrics.

Since the measurement configuration is requested to moderate the properties of both RMs and samples for obtaining an ideal measurement precision, therefore it is of importance to determine the appropriate measurement configurations of RMs to achieve accurate nitrogen isotope compositions of samples. Therefore, it is urgent to systematically examine RMs for optimizing the configurations and further improve the measurement precision. METHODS Gas source isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) coupled with an online elemental analyzer (EA) equipped with a single quartz reactor was performed to analyze the nitrogen isotope compositions. Some adjustments were executed as follows: (1) as the in-house working standard, urea was used to investigate the influences of the combustion through moderating the different oxygen injections (0~20 mL) and sample delay times (10~12 s), and optimize the combustion conditions in order to enhance the oxidation ability; (2) CO2 from the sample gas stream was removed to prevent interferences between CO2 and N2 ; (3) international RMs including USGS40 (L-glutamic), IAEA600 (caffeine), and soil standard (B2153) with a low organic content, were systematically analyzed under the optimized configurations, and their precisions of the δ15 N values were furthermore examined. RESULTS Our results showed that sufficient oxygen should be injected to improve the sample combustion when analyzing δ15 N in natural samples such as soil or marine sediment with low organic content. In addition, the measurement precision of δ15 N was affected by the tailing of the CO2 peak from the GC column into the subsequent sample measurement if the EA is equipped with a single quartz reactor column. Our adjustments can produce an optimized repeatability and accuracy of the δ15 N value, especially for RMs with low organic content, and the uncertainty of the measurements is improved better than 0.1‰ under optimized configurations. CONCLUSIONS The analytical conditions such as the oxygen flow rate and injection time or sample introduction time into EA, need to be adjusted depending on the combustion conditions of the RMs and samples to obtain a reliable accuracy of measurement. We recommend that when analyzing δ15 N of natural samples such as soil or marine sediment samples with low organic content, more oxygen should be injected to improve the combustion of the samples. In addition, CO2 should be removed from the sample gas stream before introducing into the IRMS when EA is equipped with a single quartz reactor.","Wang, Nan; Liu, Jingyu; Zhang, Yang; Xia, Cuimei; Lin, Deju; Che, Yangli; Wu, Jianzheng; Bao, Rui",Rapid communications in mass spectrometry : RCM,102,16

The target participants were urology healthcare providers. The survey was disseminated via mailing lists and the Twitter platform. RESULTS A total of 526 urology providers from 56 countries responded to the survey and it was completed by 73.3%. Participants' overall experience was better in a face-to-face meeting, followed by a hybrid and webinar only meeting. While opportunities for networking was identified as high in face-to-face meeting, online webinars were more cost effective, and learning opportunity and reach of audience was higher for hybrid meetings. For online webinar format, Zoom platform was used by 73% and majority (69%) saw it on their laptop or desktop. The preference was for a one-hour webinar in the evenings with 3-5 speakers. Urology residents rated face-to-face meetings to have better cost-effectiveness when compared to consultants. Post COVID-19, more than half of all respondents would prefer hybrid meetings compared to the other formats.

METHODS From August to December 2015, patients who underwent US-guided thermal ablation of liver tumors at our hospital with available CT/MRI images were enrolled consecutively. Both CT/MRI-CEUS and US-CEUS fusion imaging were performed in all patients to evaluate treatment responses. The applicable rate, success rate of registration and duration time were recorded. Complications were monitored in the follow-up period, and CECT/MRI within three months were taken as the standard reference of technical efficacy. RESULTS A total of 157 liver tumors (19 ± 8 mm, range 8-55 mm) in 115 patients (54 ± 11 years old, range 2 7∼ 84 years old) were enrolled. The applicable rate of US-CEUS fusion imaging was 61.1% (96/157) because of inconspicuous lesions in US, lower than that of CT/MRI-CEUS fusion imaging (99.7% (155/157)) (p < .05). However, the success rate of registration in US-CEUS fusion imaging (93.8% (90/96)) was superior to that of CT/MRI-US fusion imaging (81.3% (126/155)) (p < .05), especially for cases combined with alternative preablation surgeries or procedures (p < .05). The technical efficacy rate was 99.3% (150/151) according to the CECT/CEMRI.

RESULTS Both toothpastes reduced DH in test teeth, but pain reduction in the test group was significantly better at all timepoints and by all measures (p = 0.005, tooth-level VAS immediately after brushing; p < 0.001 all other comparisons). There was a relative risk reduction of Schiff sensitivity of 55% immediately after brushing which rose to 81% after 7 and 88.6% after 14 days (all p < 0.001). There were no differences in plaque, whole mouth VAS or DHEQ15 scores at any time point. CONCLUSION This study demonstrated the efficacy of an aluminium lactate/potassium nitrate/hydroxylapatite toothpaste compared to a potassium nitrate control toothpaste for the prevention of dentine hypersensitivity both immediately and over a 2 week period. This agent appears to have potential for pain alleviation from the common oral pain condition of DH and further research is warranted. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE DH pain, whilst transient in nature, is arresting in magnitude, affecting quality of life. Daily application of efficacious toothpastes can relieve DH pain however, as yet, there is no gold standard treatment. The results of this study support further investigation of an aluminium lactate/potassium nitrate/hydroxylapatite toothpaste for DH management.","Seong, Joon; Newcombe, Robert G; Foskett, Helen L; Davies, Maria; West, Nicola X",Journal of dentistry,102,17

We therefore compared the outcome of esophagectomy for patients with esophageal cancer performed with open surgery, video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS)/laparotomy (hybrid MIE), and VATS/ laparoscopy (total MIE). METHODS Patients with esophageal cancer undergoing tri-incisional esophagectomy with three different approaches between 2005 and 2009 were analyzed from a prospective database. RESULTS Three groups of patients underwent esophagectomy by open surgery (n = 64), hybrid MIE (n = 44), and total MIE (n = 30). The total MIE group had significantly longer operative times but had shorter postoperative ventilator usage times postoperative hospital stay, and they began jejunostomy feeding sooner (P < 0.05, compared with the other groups). There was a significant trend toward a decrease in postoperative pulmonary complications and anastomotic leakage in parallel to the proportion of minimally invasive procedures for esophagectomy (P < 0.05 for the trend test), with a significant difference between the open surgery and total MIE groups (30% vs. 6.7%, and 28% vs. 6.7%, respectively; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Use of a laparoscopic procedure in MIE for patients with esophageal cancer might provide benefit by facilitating postoperative recovery and reducing the rates of post-esophagectomy pulmonary complications and anastomotic leakage.","Lee, Jang-Ming; Cheng, Jen-Wei; Lin, Ming-Tsang; Huang, Pei-Ming; Chen, Jin-Shing; Lee, Yung-Chie",World journal of surgery,102,1

They help to highlight issues in the conduct of research with the aim of improving health research methodology, and ultimately reducing research waste. MAIN BODY We provide an overview of some of the key aspects of methodological studies such as what they are, and when, how and why they are done. We adopt a ""frequently asked questions"" format to facilitate reading this paper and provide multiple examples to help guide researchers interested in conducting methodological studies. Some of the topics addressed include: is it necessary to publish a study protocol? How to select relevant research reports and databases for a methodological study? What approaches to data extraction and statistical analysis should be considered when conducting a methodological study? What are potential threats to validity and is there a way to appraise the quality of methodological studies? CONCLUSION Appropriate reflection and application of basic principles of epidemiology and biostatistics are required in the design and analysis of methodological studies. This paper provides an introduction for further discussion about the conduct of methodological studies.","Mbuagbaw, Lawrence; Lawson, Daeria O; Puljak, Livia; Allison, David B; Thabane, Lehana",BMC medical research methodology,102,1

METHODS This was an institutional review board-approved study of patients who underwent laparoscopic or open MWA of malignant liver tumors. The impact of ablation algorithm (stepwise or direct heating, single or overlapping ablations, and ablation margin) and tumor-dependent (type, size, location, and blood vessel proximity) parameters on LR was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards. RESULTS A total of 179 patients with 602 liver tumors underwent 200 MWA procedures. Colorectal liver metastasis (CLM) was the most frequent tumor type followed by neuroendocrine liver metastasis (NELM), other metastatic tumors, and hepatocellular cancer (HCC). For patients followed at least a year with imaging, LR rate was 8.8% per lesion and 13.1%,1.3%, 11.7%, and 12.6%, for CLM, NELM, HCC, and other tumor types, respectively. On multivariate analysis, independent predictors of LR included tumor type, tumor size, and ablation margin. CONCLUSION LR after MWA for malignant liver tumors is predicted by both tumor and surgeon-dependent factors. Variations in the ablation algorithm did not affect LR, leaving the ablation margin as the only parameter that could be modified to optimize local tumor control.","Erten, Ozgun; Li, Pengpeng; Gokceimam, Mehmet; Akbulut, Serkan; Berber, Eren",Journal of surgical oncology,102,12

Carcinogen-induced apoptosis may trigger escape from dormancy of microtumors by interfering with inflammation resolution and triggering an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. While eicosanoid and cytokine storms are well-characterized in infection and inflammation, they are poorly characterized in cancer. Here, we demonstrate that carcinogens, such as aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), induce apoptotic cell death and the resulting cell debris stimulates hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumor growth via an ""eicosanoid and cytokine storm."" AFB1-generated debris up-regulates cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), ER stress-response genes including BiP, CHOP, and PDI in macrophages. Thus, selective cytokine or eicosanoid blockade is unlikely to prevent carcinogen-induced cancer progression. Pharmacological abrogation of both the COX-2 and sEH pathways by PTUPB prevented the debris-stimulated eicosanoid and cytokine storm, down-regulated ER stress genes, and promoted macrophage phagocytosis of debris, resulting in suppression of HCC tumor growth. Thus, inflammation resolution via dual COX-2/sEH inhibition is an approach to prevent carcinogen-induced cancer.","Fishbein, Anna; Wang, Weicang; Yang, Haixia; Yang, Jun; Hallisey, Victoria M; Deng, Jianjun; Verheul, Sanne M L; Hwang, Sung Hee; Gartung, Allison; Wang, Yuxin; Bielenberg, Diane R; Huang, Sui; Kieran, Mark W; Hammock, Bruce D; Panigrahy, Dipak",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,102,1

Contemporary surveillance systems have to adapt to these changes. We describe temporal trends and geographic origins of vector-borne diseases in Germany with regard to strengths of existing disease surveillance and to areas marked for improvement. We focused on hantavirus infection (endemic in Germany), chikungunya fever (recently emerging in Europe) and dengue fever (imported from tropical regions), representing important subgroups of vector-borne infections. Routine surveillance data on demographics, origin of infection and the date of reporting were analysed. From 2001 through 2007, 3,005 symptomatic hantavirus infections, and 85 cases of chikungunya fever were reported, similarly 1,048 cases of dengue fever in 2002 through 2007. The geographic origin of hantavirus infection was reported for 95.5% of all cases (dengue virus, 98.4%; chikungunya virus, 100%). Hantavirus infections were acquired in Germany in 97.6% of cases (n = 2800). In 2007, there was a marked increase of hantavirus cases, mainly in areas known to be endemic for hantavirus. In 2006, imported cases of chikungunya fever primarily returned from several islands of the Indian Ocean, while the majority of imported cases in 2007 came from India. The reported number of dengue fever cases have increased since 2004. Thailand contributed the largest proportion of cases (17-43% in individual years), followed by India, Brazil and Indonesia. Surveillance of notifiable vector-borne diseases in Germany is able to timely detect spatial and temporal changes of autochthonous an imported infections. Geographic and temporal data obtained by routine surveillance served as a basis for public health recommendations. In addition to surveillance of vector-borne infections in humans, nationwide monitoring programs and inventory techniques for emerging and reemerging vectors and for wildlife disease are warranted.","Jansen, Andreas; Frank, Christina; Koch, Judith; Stark, Klaus",Parasitology research,102,7

METHODS We prospectively analyzed ECCs on linear stapler cartridges used for anastomosis in 100 colon cancer patients who underwent colectomy. Having completed the functional end-to-end anastomosis, the linear stapler cartridges were irrigated with saline, which was collected for cytological examination and cytological diagnoses were made by board-certified pathologists based on Papanicolaou staining. RESULTS The detection rate of ECCs on the linear stapler cartridges was 20 %. Positive detection of ECCs was significantly associated with depth of tumor invasion (p = 0.012) and preoperative bowel preparation (p = 0.003). There were no marked differences between ECC-positive and ECC-negative groups in terms of the operation methods, tumor location, histopathological classification, and surgical margins. CONCLUSIONS Since ECCs were identified on the cartridge of the linear stapler used for anastomosis, preoperative mechanical bowel preparation using polyethylene glycol solution and cleansing at anastomotic sites using tumoricidal agents before anastomosis may be necessary to decrease ECCs in advanced colon cancer.","Ikehara, Kishiko; Endo, Shungo; Kumamoto, Kensuke; Hidaka, Eiji; Ishida, Fumio; Tanaka, Jun-Ichi; Kudo, Shin-Ei",World journal of surgical oncology,102,16

Residuals effect from surgery/anaesthesia and opioid analgesics may worsen respiration during the first nights after bariatric surgery. The aim of this observational study was to monitor respiration on the first postoperative night following elective bariatric surgery. METHODS This observational study aimed to determine the incidence and severity of hypo/apnea. Oxygen desaturation was analysed by continuous respiratory monitoring. RESULTS 45 patients were monitored with portable polygraphy equipment (Embletta, ResMed) during the first postoperative night at the general ward following elective laparoscopic bariatric surgery. Mean SpO2 was 93%; 10 patients had a mean SpO2 of less than 92% and 4 of less than 90%. The lowest mean SpO2 was 87%. There were 16 patients with a nadir SpO2 of less than 85%, lowest nadir SpO2 being 63%. An Apnoea Hypo/apnea Index (AHI) > 5 was found in 2 patients only (AHI 10 and 6), and an Oxygen Desaturation index (ODI) > 5 was found in 3 patients (24, 10 and 6, respectively). 3 patients had more prolonged (> 30 seconds) apnoea with nadir SpO2 81%, 83% and 86%. CONCLUSIONS A low mean SpO2 and short episodes of desaturation were not uncommon during the first postoperative night following elective bariatric surgery in patients without history of night time breathing disturbance. AHI and/or ODI of more than 5 were only rarely seen. Night-time respiration monitoring provided sparse additional information. Thus, it seems reasonable to have low risk patients at general ward already in their first night after bariatric surgery.","Wickerts, Liselott; Forsberg, Sune; Bouvier, Frederic; Jakobsson, Jan",F1000Research,102,19

We then created machine learning (ML) models that could analyze the collected physiologic data to determine if the ventilator was delivering potentially harmful therapy and if a deadly respiratory condition, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), was present. We also present work to aggregate these models into a mobile application that can provide responsive, real-time alerts of changes in ventilation to providers. As illustrated in the recent COVID-19 pandemic, being able to accurately predict ARDS in newly infected patients can assist in prioritizing care.

We hypothesized that a nocturnal decrease of arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) causes a temporary rise of [Epo] not detected by morning measurements. SaO2 (continuous, finger oximeter) and [Epo] (ELISA, every 4 h) were determined in young highlanders (altitude 2600 m) during 24 h of usual daily activity. In Series I (six male, nine female students), SaO2 fell during the night with the nadir occurring between 01:00 and 03:00; daily means (range 92.4-95.2%) were higher in females (+1.7%, P < 0.01). [Epo] showed opposite changes with zenith occurring at 04:00 without a sex difference. Mean daily values (22.9 ± 10.7SD U/L) were higher than values obtained at 08:00 (17.2 ± 9.5 U/L, P < 0.05). In Series II (seven females), only SaO2 was measured. During follicular and luteal phases, SaO2 variation was similar to Series I, but the rhythm was disturbed during menstruation. While daily [Epo] variations at sea level are not homogeneous, there is a diurnal variation at altitude following changes in SaO2 Larger hypoventilation-dependent decreases of alveolar PO2 decreases during the night probably cause a stronger reduction of SaO2 in highlanders compared to lowlanders. This variation might be enlarged by a diurnal fluctuation of Hb concentration. In spite of a lower [Hb], the higher SaO2 in women compared to men led to a similar arterial oxygen content, likely explaining the absence of differences in [Epo] between sexes.","Cristancho, Edgar; Riveros, Alain; Sánchez, Armando; Peñuela, Oscar; Böning, Dieter",Physiological reports,102,5

METHODS This was a planned exploratory analysis of the Patient Preparedness for Pelvic Organ Prolapse Surgery study, which randomized women to standardized preoperative counseling by office visit or phone call before prolapse surgery. Inclusion criteria were the completion of the assigned counseling intervention and submission of a 7-day postoperative pain and medication diary. Multivariable logistic regression was done to assess the association between counseling method and total opioid use while controlling for variables significant on univariate analysis (surgery type and county of residence). RESULTS There were 84 participants with postoperative data (41 office, 43 phone). Median total number of 5-mg oxycodone tablets used was higher for the office group (5 [interquartile range, 0-10]) than the phone group (0 [interquartile range, 0-2], P = 0.002). On multivariable logistic regression, women who underwent phone counseling were less likely to be in the highest third of opioid use when controlling for surgery type and county of residence (odds ratio, 0.23; P = 0.012; 95% confidence interval, 0.07-0.72). Daily pain scores and nonopioid medication use (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications and acetaminophen) were similar between groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Despite similar pain scores, women who received preoperative phone counseling before pelvic organ prolapse surgery had lower opioid utilization than those with office counseling. Further research is needed to determine the optimal method of preoperative counseling and its role in postoperative pain management.","Sassani, Jessica C; Artsen, Amanda M; Grosse, Philip J; Baranski, Lindsey; Kunkle, Lauren; Ackenbom, Mary F",Female pelvic medicine & reconstructive surgery,102,28

Since its bioavailability is low at high doses, dose proportionality is not achieved for pharmacokinetic parameters. However, when taken with food, its bioavailability increases at high doses. In this study, nanocrystal technology was used to increase the solubility and, hence, the bioavailability of RXB. Pluronic F127, pharmacoat 603, and PVP K-30 were used as stabilizers to prepare RXB nanosuspension, combining ball mill and high pressure homogenization methods. Particle sizes of RXB in nanosuspension (formulation A:348 nm; formulation B:403 nm) and nanocrystal formulations (formulation A:1167 nm; formulation B:606 nm) were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) compared to those of bulk RXB. In both formulations, 80% of the drug dissolved in 30 min. For dose proportionality evaluation, 3, 10, and 15 mg/kg of RXB nanosuspensions (formulation B) were administered to rabbits. The dose proportionality for AUC and Cmax of RXB nanocrystals was assessed by the power model, variance analysis of pharmacokinetic parameters, linear regression, and equivalence criterion methods. Dose proportionality for AUC was achieved at doses between 10-15 and 3-15 mg/kg. In conclusion, the preparation of a nanocrystal formulation of RXB improved its dissolution rate and pharmacokinetic profile.","Demir, Huriye; Gulsun, Tugba; Ozkan, Melike Hacer; Nemutlu, Emirhan; Sahin, Selma; Öner, Levent",AAPS PharmSciTech,102,1

BACKGROUND LVOT obstruction is a life-threatening complication of TMVR, caused by septal displacement of the AML. METHODS The procedure was used in patients with severe mitral valve disease and prohibitive surgical risk. Patients either had prior surgical mitral valve ring (n = 3) or band annuloplasty (n = 1) or mitral annular calcification with stenosis (n = 1). Iatrogenic LVOT obstruction or transcatheter heart valve dysfunction was predicted in all based on echocardiography and computed tomography. Transfemoral coronary guiding catheters directed an electrified guidewire across the center and base of the AML toward a snare in the left atrium. The externalized guidewire loop was then electrified to lacerate the AML along the centerline from base to tip, sparing chordae, immediately before transseptal TMVR. RESULTS Five patients with prohibitive risk of LVOT obstruction or transcatheter heart valve dysfunction from TMVR successfully underwent LAMPOON, with longitudinal splitting of the A2 scallop of the AML, before valve implantation. Multiplane computed tomography modeling predicted hemodynamic collapse from TMVR assuming an intact AML. However, critical LVOT gradients were not seen following LAMPOON and TMVR. Doppler blood flow was seen across transcatheter heart valve struts that encroached the LVOT, because the AML was split. Transcatheter heart valve function was unimpeded. CONCLUSIONS This novel catheter technique, which resembles surgical chord-sparing AML resection, may enable TMVR in patients with prohibitive risk of LVOT obstruction or transcatheter heart valve dysfunction.","Babaliaros, Vasilis C; Greenbaum, Adam B; Khan, Jaffar M; Rogers, Toby; Wang, Dee Dee; Eng, Marvin H; O'Neill, William W; Paone, Gaetano; Thourani, Vinod H; Lerakis, Stamatios; Kim, Dennis W; Chen, Marcus Y; Lederman, Robert J",JACC.

However, mammalian-cell-produced E60 exhibits antibody-dependent enhancement of infection (ADE) activity, rendering it inefficacious in vivo, and treated animals more susceptible to developing more severe diseases during secondary infection. In this study, we evaluated a plant-based expression system for the production of therapeutically suitable E60. The mAb was transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamianaWT and a ∆XFT line, a glycosylation mutant lacking plant-specific N-glycan residues. The mAb was efficiently expressed and assembled in leaves and exhibited highly homogenous N-glycosylation profiles, i.e. GnGnXF3 or GnGn structures, depending on the expression host. Both E60 glycovariants demonstrated equivalent antigen-binding specificity and in vitro neutralization potency against DENV serotypes 2 and 4 compared with their mammalian-cell-produced counterpart. By contrast, plant-produced E60 exhibited reduced ADE activity in Fc gamma receptor expressing human cells. Our results suggest the ability of plant-produced antibodies to minimize ADE, which may lead to the development of safe and highly efficacious antibody-based therapeutics against DENV and other ADE-prone viral diseases. Our study provides so far unknown insight into the relationship between mAb N-glycosylation and ADE, which contributes to our understanding of how sugar moieties of antibodies modulate Fc-mediated functions and viral pathogenesis.","Dent, Matthew; Hurtado, Jonathan; Paul, Amber M; Sun, Haiyan; Lai, Huafang; Yang, Ming; Esqueda, Adrian; Bai, Fengwei; Steinkellner, Herta; Chen, Qiang",The Journal of general virology,102,6

Levels of proteins induced by vitamin K absence for factor II (PIVKA-II) reflect hypocarboxylated prothrombin and can be used to detect subclinical vitamin K deficiency. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of perioperative subclinical vitamin K deficiency among neurosurgical patients using PIVKA-II and investigate the existence of any correlation to standard coagulation assays. Also, the antitumor effects of vitamin K were reviewed. Thirty-five patients undergoing brain tumor resection were included. Blood samples were drawn preoperatively, at the end of surgery and in the morning after surgery. In addition to PIVKA-II, factor II and the Owren and Quick prothrombin times were analyzed. Seventeen of 35 patients had elevated PIVKA-II levels before surgery, which continued to be above normal range postoperatively. Median PIVKA-II and Owren prothrombin time (PT-INR) were increased on the morning day 1 postoperatively compared to before surgery, whereas Quick end-stage prothrombin time (EPT) decreased and factor II was unaffected. Postoperative complications were connected to high PIVKA-II increases. Positive correlations between PIVKA-II and factor II and body mass index (BMI) were found. In conclusion, PIVKA-II was increased in many patients preoperatively and then increased by the morning following surgery. Standard coagulation assays were largely non-pathological. Correlations were demonstrated between PIVKA-II and factor II and BMI. The effect of perioperative treatment with different vitamin K supplements should be investigated in future studies, as well as clinical trials evaluating their antitumor effects.","Dahlberg, Sofia; Nilsson, Caroline Ulfsdotter; Kander, Thomas; Schött, Ulf",Scandinavian journal of clinical and laboratory investigation,102,13

Nurses are health care providers who play a pivotal role in all phases of disaster management and psychiatric nurses are required to be prepared and equipped with competencies to respond to such disasters. This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the effects of mental health nurses' professional quality of life on disaster nursing competencies. This study adhered to the STROBE checklist for observational research. Data were collected from 196 mental health nurses working in various settings, including hospitals and communities in South Korea. Compassion satisfaction and compassion fatigue were measured using the Korean version of the Professional Quality of Life Scale. Disaster nursing competencies were measured using the Disaster Nursing Preparedness-Response Competencies Scale. Multiple regression analysis showed that compassion satisfaction (β = 0.36, P < 0.001) was the most potent predictor of disaster nursing competencies of mental health nurses, followed by participation in disaster nursing (β = 0.15, P = 0.023) and disaster nursing-related education (β = 0.15, P = 0.026); these factors explained 30.1% of the variance. Education programmes ensuring that mental health nurses are adequately prepared for disaster management should include theoretical content as well as simulation training using virtual situations that resemble actual disasters. Further, supportive leadership and work environments that encourage cohesive teamwork are needed to increase compassion satisfaction of nurses.","Jang, Sun Joo; Kim, Heejeong; Lee, Haeyoung",International journal of mental health nursing,102,12

Two different isomeric Pt (II)-porphyrins were synthetized and applied. PDI experiments in the strains of Mycobacteroides abscessus subsp. Abscessus (ATCC 19977), Mycolicibacterium fortuitum (ATCC 6841), Mycobacteroides abscessus subsp. Massiliense (ATCC 48898), and Mycolicibacterium smegmatis (ATCC 700084) conducted with adequate concentration (without aggregation) of photosensitizers (PS) under white-light illumination for 90 min showed that the most effective PS significantly reduced the concentration of viable mycobacteria. The present results show that positively charged porphyrins at the meta position (3-PtTPyP) are more efficient PS against M. abscessus, M. fortuitum, M. massiliense, and M. smegmatis. The effectiveness of the molecule as PS for PDI studies is also clear with mycobacteria, which is strongly related with the porphyrin peripheral charge and coordination platinum (II) compounds and consequently their solubility in physiological media. Tetra-cationic PS may be promising anti-mycobacterial PDI agents with potential applications in medical clinical cases and bioremediation.","Rossi, Grazielle Guidolin; Guterres, Kevim Bordignon; da Silveira, Carolina Hahn; Moreira, Kelly Schneider; Burgo, Thiago Augusto Lima; Iglesias, Bernardo Almeida; de Campos, Marli Matiko Anraku",Microbial pathogenesis,102,1

As the mevalonate pathway (MVP) prevents the activation of inflammasomes and cytokine release and regulates endosomal transport, compromised signaling could be associated with the pathobiology of COVID-19. Prior transcriptomic studies of host cells in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection have not reported to date the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the MVP. In this study, we accessed public datasets to report in-silico investigations into gene expression. In addition, we proposed candidate genes which are thought to have a direct association with the pathogenesis of COVID-19, and which may be dependent on signals derived from the MVP. RESULTS Our results revealed dysregulation of genes involved in the MVP. These results were not found when investigating the gene expression data from host cells infected with H3N2 influenza virus, H1N1 influenza virus (IAV) or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Our manually curated gene set showed significant gene expression variability in A549 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2, as per Blanco-Melo, et al. dataset (GSE147507). CONCLUSIONS In light of the present findings, SARS-CoV-2 could hijack the MVP, leading to hyperinflammatory responses. Prompt reconstitution of this pathway with available agents should be considered in future studies. This article is protected by copyright.

Despite this, there is only a limited number of reports describing the outcomes of pediatric spinal GBMs, both as primary spinal GBMs and metastases from an intracranial tumor. Here, we performed an individual patient meta-analysis to characterize factors affecting prognosis of pediatric spinal GBM. MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane databases were searched for published studies on GBMs involving the spine in pediatric patients (age ≤ 21 years old). Factors associated with the survival were assessed with multi-factor ANOVAs, Cox hazard regression, and Kaplan-Meier analyses. We extracted data on 61 patients with spinal GBM from 40 studies that met inclusion criteria. Median survival was significantly longer in the primary spinal GBM compared that those with metastatic GBM (11 vs 3 months, p < 0.001). However, median survival of metastatic GBM patients was 10 months following diagnosis of their primary brain tumor, which was not different from that of primary spinal GBM patients (p = 0.457). Among primary spinal GBM patients, chemotherapy (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.255 [0.106-0.615], p = 0.013) and extent of resection (HR = 0.582 [0.374-0.905], p = 0.016) conferred a significant survival benefit. Younger age (less than 14 years) was associated with longer survival in patients treated with chemotherapy than those who did not undergo chemotherapy (β = - 1.12, 95% CI [- 2.20, - 0.03], p < 0.05). In conclusion, survival after presentation of metastases from intracranial GBM is poor in the pediatric population. In patients with metastatic GBM, chemotherapy may have provided the most benefit in young patients, and its efficacy might have an association with extent of surgical resection.","Yang, Runze; Isaacs, Albert M; Cadieux, Magalie; Hirmer, Tomas J; CreveCoeur, Travis S; Lapointe, Andrew P; Opoku-Darko, Michael; Premji, Zahra; Riva-Cambrin, Jay; Gallagher, Clare N",Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for Pediatric Neurosurgery,102,16

Currently, the evidence is mixed, but the playing field was not level because traditional statistics cannot provide evidence for the null hypothesis. Experiment 1: MTurk workers (ages 19-74) performed simple and complex visuospatial WM tasks to determine whether a secondary task affected the rate of age-related decline. Performance on both tasks replicated previous laboratory studies, establishing that age-related differences in WM can be studied online. Bayesian analyses revealed it is ten times as likely that there is no inhibitory deficit on visuospatial WM tasks as that there is. Experiment 2: The effects of irrelevant location information on visuospatial WM were examined in older (M age = 64.0) and younger (M age = 25.0) MTurk workers. Irrelevant locations produced interference, but both groups were equally affected. Bayesian analyses provided support for the null hypothesis of no age difference. Conclusions: The results of both experiments on working memory not only revealed equivalent visuospatial inhibitory function in older and younger adults, they also demonstrated that age-related differences in visuospatial WM can be effectively studied online as well as in the laboratory.","Myerson, Joel; Featherston, Kyle G; Flores, Cynthia; Lilienthal, Lindsey; Bui, Young; Hale, Sandra",Experimental aging research,102,1

The value of a QALY has not been used to deny all intervention, as the rule of rescue attests. Further, while there was no other way of managing the pandemic, there were other means available to mitigate the economic losses. Now that vaccine programs have commenced in several countries, it is interesting to consider whether economic evaluation should now be applied. However, the recognised complexities of the evaluation of vaccines, plus the challenge of measuring opportunity costs in the face of an economic recession and the severity of the consequences of an outbreak even though the probability of transmission is exceedingly low, mean its use will be restricted.

Simulation-based team training within emergency medicine and critical care contexts is best known for its use by trauma teams and teams involved in cardiac arrest. In the domain of emergency medicine, simulation-based team training is also used for other typical time-critical clinical presentations. We aimed to review the existing literature and current state of evidence pertaining to non-technical skills obtained via simulation-based team training in emergency medicine and critical care contexts, excluding trauma and cardiac arrest contexts. METHODS This systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement. Before the initiation of the study, the protocol was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) database. We conducted a systematic literature search of 10 years of publications, up to December 17, 2019, in the following databases: PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and CINAHL. Two authors independently reviewed all the studies and extracted data. RESULTS Of the 456 studies screened, 29 trials were subjected to full-text review, and 13 studies were included in the final review. None of the studies was randomized controlled trials, and no studies compared simulation training to different modalities of training. Studies were heterogeneous; they applied simulation-training concepts of different durations and intensities and used different outcome measures for non-technical skills. Two studies reached Kirkpatrick level 3. Out of the remaining 11 studies, nine reached Kirkpatrick level 2, and two reached Kirkpatrick level 1. CONCLUSIONS The literature on simulation-based team training in emergency medicine is heterogeneous and sparse, but somewhat supports the hypothesis that simulation-based team training is beneficial to teams' knowledge and attitudes toward non-technical skills (Kirkpatrick level 2). Randomized trials are called for to clarify the effect of simulation compared to other modalities of team training. Future research should focus on the transfer of skills and investigate improvements in patient outcomes (Kirkpatrick level 4).","Weile, Jesper; Nebsbjerg, Mette Amalie; Ovesen, Stig Holm; Paltved, Charlotte; Ingeman, Mads Lind",Advances in simulation,102,31

Methods A systematic literature search was performed to identify studies reporting outcomes of pediatric (<18 y) LDLT and DDLT published between 2005 and 2019. A meta-analysis was conducted to examine peri- and postoperative outcomes using fixed- and random-effects models. Results Overall, 2518 abstracts were screened, and 10 studies met criteria for inclusion. In total, 1622 LDLT and 6326 DDLT pediatric patients from 4 continents were examined.

The morphology and surface composition were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). For a better understanding of insulin determination on NiO-modified electrodes, the mechanism of electrochemical reaction and the kinetic parameters were studied. They were calculated from both voltammetric and amperometric measurements. The modified carbon electrode displayed a wide linear range from 600 nM to 10 µM, a low limit of detection of 19.6 nM, and a high sensitivity of 7.06 µA/µM. The electrodes were stable for 30 cycles and were able to detect insulin even in bovine blood serum. Additionally, the temperature stability of this electrode and its storage conditions were studied with appropriate outcomes. The above results show the high promise of this electrode for detecting insulin in clinical samples.","Shepa, Jana; Šišoláková, Ivana; Vojtko, Marek; Trnková, Libuše; Nagy, Géza; Maskaľová, Iveta; Oriňak, Andrej; Oriňaková, Renáta",Sensors,102,12

Numerous IE patients develop a persistent functional immunological phenotype that can best be characterized by a profound anti-inflammation and/ or functional ""anergy."" This is pronounced in patients with unresolved infectious foci and was previously referred to as ""injury-associated immunosuppression"" (IAI). IAI can be assessed by measurement of the monocytic human leukocyte antigen-DR (mHLA-DR) expression, a global functional marker of immune competence. Persistence of IAI is associated with prolonged intensive care unit length of stay, increased secondary infection rates, and death. Immunomodulation to reverse IAI was shown beneficial in early immunostimulatory (randomized controlled) clinical trials. METHODS Prospective 1:1 randomized controlled clinical study to compare the course of mHLA-DR in patients scheduled for cardiac surgery for IE. Patients will receive either best standard of care plus cytokine adsorption during surgery while on cardiopulmonary bypass (protocol A) versus best standard of care alone, that is, surgery without cytokine adsorption (protocol B). A total of 54 patients will be recruited and randomized. The primary endpoint is a change in quantitative expression of mHLA-DR (antibodies per cell on CD14+ monocytes/ macrophages, assessed using a quantitative standardized assay) from baseline (preoperation [pre-OP], visit 1) to day 1 post-OP (visit 4). DISCUSSION This randomized controlled clinical trial (RECReATE) will compare 2 clinical treatment protocols and will investigate whether cytokine adsorption restores monocytic immune competence (reflected by increased mHLA-DR expression) in patients with IE undergoing cardiac surgery.

We hypothesized that the liver would activate a developmentally-regulated acute innate immune response to intraperitoneal lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We first assessed the hepatic expression and activity of the NF-κB, a key regulator of the innate immune response, at different developmental ages (p0, p3, p7, p35, and adult). Ontogeny of the NF-κB subunits (p65/p50) revealed a reduction in Rela (p65) and Nfkb1 (p105, precursor to p50) gene expression (p0) and p65 subunit protein levels (p0 and p3) vs. older ages. The acute hepatic innate immune response to LPS was associated by the degradation of the NF-κB inhibitory proteins (IκBα and IκBβ), and nuclear translocation of the NF-κB subunit p50 in all ages, whereas nuclear translocation of the NF-κB subunit p65 was only observed in the p35 and adult mouse. Consistent with these findings, we detected NF-κB subunit p65 nuclear staining exclusively in the LPS-exposed adult liver compared with p7 mouse. We next interrogated the LPS-induced hepatic expression of pro-inflammatory genes (Tnf, Icam1, Ccl3, and Traf1), and observed a gradually increase in gene expression starting from p0. Confirming our results, hepatic NF-κB subunit p65 nuclear translocation was associated with up-regulation of the Icam1 gene in the adult, and was not detected in the p7 mouse. Thus, an inflammatory challenge induces an NF-κB-mediated hepatic innate immune response activation across all developmental ages, but nuclear translocation of the NF-κB subunit p65 and associated induction of pro-inflammatory genes occurred only after the first month of life. Our results demonstrate that the LPS-induced hepatic innate immune response is developmentally regulated by the NF-κB subunit p65 in the mouse.","Zarate, Miguel A; Nguyen, Leanna M; De Dios, Robyn K; Zheng, Lijun; Wright, Clyde J",Frontiers in immunology,102,1

However, there is no comprehensive study reported about the currents status of stroke-related apps available to adopt in Chinese app market. The aim of this study is to assess the current status of stroke-related apps available to adopt in China. MATERIALS AND METHODS Using Stroke-related keywords written in either Chinese or English, the top 6 most prevalent apps online stores in China were searched from June to August 2018, including android market, 360 app market, wan dou jia, baidu mobile app, ying yong bao, apple app store. The basic features of selected apps were analyzed based on operating system, cost, target people, engagement, online interaction, release date, size, popularity, and usefulness. The information accountability of selected apps was evaluated with the Silberg scale. The functionality of selected apps targeting stroke patients at home were reviewed by researchers. RESULTS Our study showed that the downloads of stroke-related apps from android platform and the engagement of health professionals in apps development were critically insufficient. And most apps didn't offer a platform to facilitate online interaction with health professional. The information accountability of apps also presented a huge room for improvement. The average Silberg score of 127 apps was 3.5 (out of 9) with most apps not disclosing sponsorship, authors' affiliations, credentials, and sources or references of information. Few apps were modified in the past months. What's more, although the apps targeting stroke patients at home have covered 9 functionalities, most apps had only a simple functionality. CONCLUSION This study identified areas for improvement concerning information accountability of stroke-related apps available for adoption in China and reviewed functionality of apps targeting stroke patients at home. The findings might guide the development for stroke-related apps in China in the future.","Zhang, Huixia; Wang, Tao; Zhang, Zhenxiang; Lin, Beilei; Mei, Yongxia; Zhang, Yongchao; Chen, Gang",Medicine,102,31

This report describes the first high-throughput screen using a novel self-assembled monolayer desorption ionization (SAMDI)-ASMS methodology to reveal ligands for the human rhinovirus 3C (HRV3C) protease. The approach combines self-assembled monolayers of alkanethiolates on gold with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI TOF) mass spectrometry (MS), a technique termed SAMDI-ASMS. The primary screen of more than 100,000 compounds in pools of 8 compounds per well was completed in less than 8 h, and informs on the binding potential and selectivity of each compound. Initial hits were confirmed in follow-up SAMDI-ASMS experiments in single-concentration and dose-response curves. The ligands identified by SAMDI-ASMS were further validated using differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) and in functional protease assays against HRV3C and the related SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro enzyme. SAMDI-ASMS offers key benefits for drug discovery over traditional ASMS approaches, including the high-throughput workflow and readout, minimizing compound misbehavior by using smaller compound pools, and up to a 50-fold reduction in reagent consumption. The flexibility of this novel technology opens avenues for high-throughput ASMS assays of any target, thereby accelerating drug discovery for diverse diseases.","Scholle, Michael D; McLaughlin, Doug; Gurard-Levin, Zachary A",SLAS discovery : advancing life sciences R & D,102,11

This article examines the vascular safety of six devices currently used for this purpose using cadaveric examination. METHOD Devices were evaluated for cost and for their ability to reliably avoid vessels behind the sacrospinous ligament by applying each to the traditionally described location, two fingerbreadths medial to the right ischial spine. We selected the five predissected, preserved pelves and right hemipelves where vessels remained attached. RESULTS The i stitch(®) was seen to penetrate coccygeal branches of inferior gluteal artery. The Capio(®) , Caspari(™) and Endostitch(®) remained confined within all, including thin, ligaments. The Miya(®) hook and Deschamp(®) impinged upon but deflected vessels behind thin ligaments. CONCLUSIONS VascuIar anatomy behind the sacrospinous ligament is enormously variable. Suture placement two fingerbreadths medial to the spine does not guarantee safety. The ligament may be thin in the elderly, who are unlikely to cope with haemorrhage yet who may represent a growing proportion of those requiring surgery. For vascular safety, the ideal device is compact. It impresses and enfolds but does not penetrate behind the ligament. The sharp penetrating component that carries suture should traverse the shortest distance at the shallowest depth allowing adequate bite. This was satisfied by the Caspari(®) , Capio(®) and less so by Endostitch(®) . The i stitch(®) was not safe in thin ligaments. The Deschamp(®) and Miya(®) devices may be a good compromise for the developing world where cost is important.","Manning, Jane A; Arnold, Peter",The Australian & New Zealand journal of obstetrics & gynaecology,102,5

The aim of this prospective, non-randomized, cohort study is to compare between laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and laparoscopic one-anastomosis gastric bypass (LOAGB) in terms of their early postoperative effects on portal venous flow and patency. METHODS Forty-nine morbidly obese patients were allocated to one of 2 groups (A or B). Group A patients underwent LSG, whereas group B patients underwent LOAGB. Portal venous Doppler ultrasound scanning was performed preoperatively and 2 weeks postoperatively in all cases, in order to assess the portal venous flow (PVF) in terms of flow direction and peak systolic velocity (PSV); as well as to assess the portal venous patency and exclude PVT. The mean change in PSV (ΔPSV) and the mean percentage change in PSV (%ΔPSV) were determined in both groups. RESULTS In all cases (group A (n = 26); group B (n = 23)), the direction of PVF was ""hepatopetal"" both preoperatively and 2 weeks postoperatively. The mean ΔPSV and the mean %ΔPSV were higher in LSG patients ""group A"" (- 0.84 cm/s and 3.25% respectively) compared with LOAGB patients ""group B""(- 0.06 cm/s and 0.27% respectively); P = 0.038 and 0.039 respectively. The mean change in PSV was in the negative direction in both groups, i.e., ""deceleration."" No cases of PVT were reported in the study.

In this study, we describe a surgical strategy for in vivo isolation of the pig liver, resulting in a vascular watertight organ that allows the evaluation of several gene injection conditions. The hepatic artery and portal, suprahepatic and infrahepatic cava veins were dissected. Then, liver vascularization was excluded for 5-7 min. In that time, we first injected 200 ml saline solution containing the p3c-eGFP plasmid (20 µg/ml) simultaneously through two different catheters placed in the portal and cava veins, respectively. Vital constants were monitored during the surgery to assess the safety of the procedure. Basal systolic/diastolic blood pressures were 92.8/63.2 mm Hg and dropped to 40.7/31.3 mm Hg at the end of vascular exclusion; the mean basal heart rate was 58 bpm, reaching 95 bpm when the blood pressure was low. Oxygen saturation was maintained above 98% during the intervention, and no relevant changes were observed in the ECG tracing. Peak plasma AST (aspartate aminotransferase) and ALT (alanine aminotransferase) levels were observed after 24 h (151 and 57 IU, respectively). These values were higher, but not relevant, in 60 ml/s injection than in 20 ml/s injection. Efficiency of gene transfer was studied with simultaneous (cava and portal veins) injection of eGFP gene at flow rates of 20 and 60 ml/s. Liver tissue samples were collected 24 h after injection and qPCR was carried out on each lobe sample. The results confirmed the efficiency of the procedure. Gene delivery differed between 20 ml/s (9.9-31.0 eGFP DNA copies/100 pg of total DNA) and 60 ml/s injections (0.6-1.1 eGFP DNA copies/100 pg of total DNA). Gene transcription showed no significant differences between 20 ml/s (15,701.8-21,475.8 eGFP RNA copies/100 ng of total RNA) and 60 ml/s (12,014-36,371 eGFP RNA copies/100 ng of total RNA). The procedure is not harmful for animals and it offers a wide range of gene delivery options because it allows different perfusion ways (anterograde and retrograde) and different flow rates to determine the optimal conditions of gene transfer. This strategy permits the use of cell therapy and viral or non-viral liver gene therapy, especially appropriated to a wide variety of inherited or acquired diseases because of the liver's ability to produce and deliver proteins to the bloodstream.","Carreño, O; Sendra, L; Montalvá, E; Miguel, A; Orbis, F; Herrero, M J; Noguera, I; Aliño, S F; Lopez-Andujar, R",European surgical research.

Massive changes in the health care system imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic clearly impact the overall quality of medical care. In this survey, we aim to explore experiences and concerns of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) regarding the current pandemic. METHODS A 40-item web-based questionnaire on disease-related experiences and concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic was made available to patients with IBD from 28 April 2020 to 31 July 2020. RESULTS An increased risk of SARS-CoV2 infection was a concern for 56.7% of the 1199 patients (aged 41.3±12.8, women 77%, Crohn's disease 58.8%, ulcerative colitis 38.5%); 61.7% feared an increased risk of severe disease course of COVID-19. Effective preventive measures in either outpatient practices or hospitals were observed by 84.7% of the patients. Appointments with an IBD specialist were canceled in 38.7%, frequently on the patients' initiative. Telecommunication visits were considered an acceptable alternative to personal visits by 71.0%. Medication was reduced or paused in 6.9% because of the pandemic. A swab (SARS-CoV2-PCR) was done in 13.2% of the patients; only 3 patients (0.25%) were tested positive. CONCLUSION The COVID-19 pandemic is a major concern of patients with IBD. However, the cumulative prevalence in our cohort is low. Patients at risk should be identified and counseled individually. When required because of the local COVID-19 situation, telecommunication visits and liberal prescription policies are advisable to reduce in-person contacts, while ensuring continuous therapy and maintaining communication with patients.","Schlabitz, Franziska; Teich, Niels; Riesner-Wehner, Anica; Böhm, Sebastian; Greinert, Robin; Eisenmann, Stephan; Michl, Patrick; Walldorf, Jens",Journal of clinical gastroenterology,102,1

Forty consecutive women with main uterine prolapse stage II or greater defined by the POP quantification(POP-Q) staging system were referred for LONG procedures at our hospitals. Clinical evaluations before and 6 months after surgery included pelvic examination, urodynamic study, and a personal interview to evaluate urinary and sexual symptoms with overactive bladder symptom score(OABSS), the short forms of Urogenital Distress Inventory(UDI-6) and Incontinence Impact Questionnaire(IIQ-7), and the Female Sexual Function Index(FSFI). After follow-up time of 12 to 30 months, anatomical cure rate was 85%(34/40), and the success rates for apical, anterior, and posterior vaginal prolapse were 95%(38/40), 85%(34/40), and 97.5%(39/40), respectively. Six recurrences of anterior vaginal wall all suffered from significant cystocele (stage3; Ba>+1) preoperatively. The average operative time was 73.1 ± 30.8 minutes. One bladder injury occurred and was recognized during surgery. The dyspareunia domain and total FSFI scores of the twelve sexually-active premenopausal women improved postoperatively in a significant manner (P < 0.05).

For gastric cancer patients with an LVAD, surgery may be the only curative treatment, especially as chemotherapy is scarcely available. However, we cannot perform an upper-middle incision in these patients because of the LVAD's location and driveline. Furthermore, to reduce the risk of driveline infection, minimally invasive surgery is desirable. Therefore, laparoscopic surgery is, where possible, suitable for achieving a secure approach to the abdominal cavity. However, laparoscopic surgery for patients with LVAD requires careful consideration not only for anesthetic management, but also for the technical procedure.

METHODS In total, 90 liver tumors, 45 HCCs in a cirrhotic liver and 45 CRLMs were treated with RFA or with one of two MWA devices (MWA_A and MWA_B), resulting in 15 procedures for each tumor type, per device. Device settings were recorded and the applied energy was calculated. Ablation volumes were segmented on the contrast-enhanced CT scans obtained 1 week after the procedure. The ratio of ablation zone volume in milliliters to applied energy in kilojoules was determined for each procedure and compared between HCC (RHCC) and CRLM (RCRLM), stratified according to ablation device. RESULTS With RFA, RHCC and RCRLM were 0.22 mL/kJ (0.14-0.45 mL/kJ) and 0.15 mL/kJ (0.14-0.22 mL/kJ; p = 0.110), respectively. With MWA_A, RHCC was 0.81 (0.61-1.07 mL/kJ) and RCRLM was 0.43 (0.35-0.61 mL/kJ; p = 0.001). With MWA_B, RHCC was 0.67 (0.41-0.85 mL/kJ) and RCRLM was 0.43 (0.35-0.61 mL/kJ; p = 0.040). CONCLUSIONS With RFA, there was no significant difference in energy deposition ratio between tumor types. With both MWA devices, the ratios were higher for HCCs. Tailoring microwave ablation device protocols to tumor type might prevent incomplete ablations. KEY POINTS • HCCs and CRLMs respond differently to microwave ablation • For MWA, CRLMs required more energy to achieve a similar ablation volume • Tailoring ablation protocols to tumor type might prevent incomplete ablations.","Heerink, Wouter J; Solouki, A Millad; Vliegenthart, Rozemarijn; Ruiter, Simeon J S; Sieders, Egbert; Oudkerk, Matthijs; de Jong, Koert P",European radiology,102,1

Traumatic carotid-cavernous fistulas (CCFs) are usually direct internal carotid artery (ICA) high-flow fistulas; whereas spontaneous CCFs are usually dural, low-flow fistulas and generally possess less severe symptoms than direct carotid-cavernous fistulas. METHODS This study involved 34 patients who were classified into 2 groups: Group A included 26 patients with direct carotid-cavernous fistula; and Group B included 8 patients with indirect dural cavernous fistula. All patients had ocular manifestations. One patient had subarachnoid hemorrhage. Coils were used alone in 19 cases of direct fistula and in 1 case of dural fistulas. Coils and Onyx (Covidien, Mansfield, MA, USA) were used in 7 cases of direct fistula and in 2 cases of dural fistulas. Onyx alone was used to treat 5 cases with dural fistulas but none of the cases with direct fistulas. Covered stents and coils were used in 2 cases of direct fistulas. RESULTS All patients in both groups showed full recovery of their clinical signs and symptoms. Only 1 procedure-related complication was observed (3%) in which a patient had an embolic event and trigeminal dysesthesia as a result of Onyx reflux through external carotid artery-ICA anastomosis. CONCLUSION Coils are superior solid embolic agents used for the treatment of direct high-flow fistulas, while Onyx is more valuable in dural low-flow CCF. Onyx shortens the procedure time and decreases procedure cost.

Few studies have investigated the predictive value of chest X-ray radiological measurements for sternal complications. METHODS Several perioperative radiological measurements at chest X-ray and clinical characteristics were computed in 849 patients deemed at high risk for sternal dehiscence (SD) or More than Grade 1 Surgical Site Infection (MG1-SSI). Multivariable analysis identified independent predictors, whilst receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analyses highlighted cut-off values of radiological measurements for the prediction of both complications. RESULTS SD occurred in 8.8% of the patients, MG1-SSI in 6.8%. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was the only independent predictor for SD (Odds Ratio, O.R. 12.1; p < 0.001); proximal sternal height (PSH) was the only independent protective factor (O.R. 0.58; p < 0.001), with a cut-off value of 11.7 mm (sensitivity 70.5%, specificity 71.0%; ROC area under the curve (AUC) = 0.768, p < 0.001). Diabetes mellitus (O.R. 3.5; p < 0.001) and COPD (O.R. 21.3; p < 0.001) were independent predictors for MG1-SSI; indexed proximal sternal height (iPSH) was as a protective factor (O.R. 0.26; p < 0.001) with a cut-off of 5.97 mm (sensitivity 70.2%, specificity 69.0%; ROC AUC = 0.739, p < 0.001). No other radiological measurements were independently correlated with SD or MG1-SS (p = N.S.). CONCLUSION PSH and iPSH at preoperative chest X-ray may act as indicators of high risk for sternal wound complications, allowing for early preventative measures.","Ardigò, Andrea; Francica, Alessandra; Veraldi, Gian Franco; Tropea, Ilaria; Tonelli, Filippo; Rossetti, Cecilia; Onorati, Francesco; Faggian, Giuseppe",Journal of clinical medicine,102,5

While current gold-standard techniques are highly sensitive and quantitative, they are slow and require expensive equipment. Conversely, current rapid field-deployable assays available provide essentially binary information about the presence of the target analyte, not a quantitative measure of concentration. Here, we report the development of a molecular diagnostic test [quantitative recombinase polymerase amplification (qRPA)] that utilizes competitive amplification during a recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) assay to provide semi-quantitative information on a target nucleic acid. We demonstrate that qRPA can quantify DNA, RNA, and viral titers in HIV and COVID-19 patient samples and that it is more robust to environmental perturbations than traditional RPA. These features make qRPA potentially useful for at-home testing to monitor the progress of viral infections or other diseases.","Mancuso, Christopher P; Lu, Zhi-Xiang; Qian, Jason; Boswell, Sarah A; Springer, Michael",Analytical chemistry,102,1

The aim of this study was to evaluate Permacol™ collagen paste (Covidien plc, Gosport, Hampshire, UK) injection for the treatment of complex anal fistulas, reporting feasibility, safety, outcome and functional results. METHODS Between May 2013 and December 2014, 21 consecutive patients underwent Permacol paste injection for complex anal fistula at our institutions. All patients underwent fistulectomy and seton placement 6-8 weeks before Permacol™ paste injection. Follow-up duration was 12 months. RESULTS Eighteen patients (85.7%) had a high transsphincteric anal fistula, and three female patients (14.3%) had an anterior transsphincteric fistula. Fistulas were recurrent in three patients (14.3%). Seven patients (33%) had a fistula with multiple tracts. After a follow-up of 12 months, ten patients were considered healed (overall success rate 47.6%). The mean preoperative FISI score was 0.33 ± 0.57 and 0.61 ± 1.02 after 12 months.

Reduction of Cr(VI) (as a poisonous species) to Cr(III) (as a slight toxic species) was performed using CuO-Kaolin with ultrasound (US) irradiation. The CuO-Kaolin nanocomposites were synthesized via a facile coprecipitation method. Then X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope and Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analyses were performed to identify the structural features of CuO-Kaolin. The role of influential parameters for the reduction of Cr(VI) was investigated in sonocatalytic advanced oxidation system. 89.35% of Cr(VI) was removed via US/CuO-Kaolin process after 90 min at optimum conditions (pH= 3, sonocatalyst dosage= 1 g L-1 and [Cr (VI)]0= 20 mg L-1). This outstanding result was due to the synergistic effect of the increased electron delivery to conduction band on CuO-Kaolin nanocomposite and the increased reactive surface region of nanoparticles by sonication. The presence of H2O2 as an amplifier improved the removal efficiency of Cr(VI) from 89.35 to 100% after 20 min. Kinetic experimental results were well described by a pseudo first-order kinetic model. Desorption experiments showed an excellent stability of sonocatalyst during the reaction and maintenance of the catalytic activity up to 10 sequential cycles.","Ayagh, Kobra; Farrokhi, Mehrdad; Yang, Jae-Kyu; Shirzad-Siboni, Mehdi",Environmental technology,102,31

Topical therapy is the gold standard for psoriasis patients with mild disease courses and for complementary and maintenance treatment in moderate and severe forms. However, while new systemic therapies are rapidly implemented in the daily routine as our pathomechanistic understanding of psoriasis evolves, the development of topical psoriasis therapies stagnates. Modern topical treatments though would require not only new active substances but also improved galenics. Due to their unique ability to directly exert biologic functions, but also to deliver drugs in optimal concentrations, enabling increased therapeutic efficacy, reduced adverse effects and improved patient compliance, nanoparticles may represent ideal drug carriers for local therapeutics in psoriasis. In recent years, a series of reports added important insights into the biology of skin-nanoparticles interactions and on how they impact the epidermal and dermal inflammatory compartments in vitro and in psoriasis plaques. Furthermore, by targeting anti-inflammatory substances to specific skin compartments, nanotechnological advances offer the exciting opportunity to fine tune skin inflammation at molecular and cellular levels, paving the road to a high-precision, skin-directed topical therapy in psoriasis.

Circular RNA (circRNA) has been confirmed to be related to tumor chemoresistance. However, the role and the underlying molecular mechanism of hsa_circ_0004674 in the chemoresistance of osteosarcoma (OS) are still unclear. METHODS The expression of hsa_circ_0004674, miR-342-3p, and fibrillin-1 (FBN1) was determined by qRT-PCR. Cell counting kit 8 assay was used to evaluate the doxorubicin (DXR) resistance of cells. The proliferation and apoptosis of cells were measured using colony formation assay and flow cytometry. Western blot analysis was utilized to examine the protein levels of resistance markers, Wnt/β-catenin pathway markers and FBN1. The interaction between miR-342-3p and hsa_circ_0004674 or FBN1 was confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA pull-down assay. Moreover, animal experiments were performed to assess the effect of hsa_circ_0004674 silencing on the DXR sensitive of OS in vivo. RESULTS The upregulated hsa_circ_0004674 was found in DXR-resistant OS tissues and cells. Knockdown of hsa_circ_0004674 could inhibit the DXR resistance of OS cells in vitro and promote the DXR sensitive of OS tumors in vivo. In addition, we discovered that hsa_circ_0004674 could sponge miR-342-3p, and miR-342-3p could target FBN1. MiR-342-3p inhibitor could reverse the inhibition effect of hsa_circ_0004674 knockdown on the DXR resistance of OS cells. Similarly, the suppressive effect of miR-342-3p on the DXR resistance of OS cells also could be reversed by FBN1 overexpression. Furthermore, we revealed that hsa_circ_0004674 silencing inhibited the activity of Wnt/β-catenin pathway by the miR-342-3p/FBN1 axis. CONCLUSION Hsa_circ_0004674 facilitated the DXR resistance of OS through Wnt/β-catenin pathway via regulating the miR-342-3p/FBN1 axis, suggesting that hsa_circ_0004674 was a promising target for the chemoresistance of OS.","Bai, Yumei; Li, Yanghua; Bai, Juan; Zhang, Yumei",Journal of orthopaedic surgery and research,102,31

This study aimed to assess the impact of gastric bypass surgery (GBS) on leptin levels and its relation to the adipose tissue expression of adiponectin. METHODS Omental and subcutaneous adipose tissue and serum were obtained from 40 obese patients undergoing GBS, from 13 patients 1 year or more after GBS, and from 16 non-obese individuals with a body mass index of 20 to 29 kg/m(2). Adiponectin gene expression was measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and the gene expression was normalized for the GAPDH gene. Serum leptin and adiponectin were measured by a high-sensitivity enzymatic assay. RESULTS Leptin levels were significantly lower in the post-GBS patients (19.8 ± 6.7) than in the pre-GBS patients (59.0 ± 5.1; P = 0.0001), and similar to those in the non-obese control subjects (18.2 ± 4; P = 0.8). Univariate analysis showed an inverse correlation between serum leptin levels and omental adiponectin gene expression (r = -0.32; P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Gastric bypass surgery results in resolution of the leptin resistance status that characterizes obese subjects. The study also demonstrated a significant correlation between leptin and adiponectin. This correlation provides preliminary evidence for studying a potential adiponectin-leptin cross-talking that may represent one of the physiologic pathways responsible for the regulation of food intake in humans.","Chen, Jiegen; Pamuklar, Zehra; Spagnoli, Anna; Torquati, Alfonso",Surgical endoscopy,102,1

However, intervention studies that verify whether recommended ventilation targets can be achieved in practice with reasonable ventilation regimes and that are also suitable for countries with cold winters are practically non-existent. To explore the initial situation in Switzerland we carried out carbon dioxide (CO2) measurements during the winter in 100 classrooms, most of which (94%) had natural window ventilation. In more than two thirds of those, the hygienic limit value of 2000 ppm specified for CO2 in the Swiss Standard SN 520180 (2014) was exceeded. To improve ventilation behavior, an intervention was implemented in 23 classrooms during the heating season. Ventilation was performed exclusively during breaks (to avoid discomfort from cold and drafts), efficiently, and only for as long as was necessary to achieve the ventilation objective of compliance with the hygienic limit value (strategic ventilation). The intervention included verbal and written instructions, awareness-raising via a school lesson and an interactive tool for students, which was also used to estimate the required duration of ventilation. CO2 exposure was significantly reduced in pilot classes (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p = 3.815e-06). Median CO2 levels decreased from 1600 ppm (control group) to 1097 ppm (intervention group), and the average proportion of teaching time at 400-1400 ppm CO2 increased from 40% to 70%. The duration of ventilation was similar to spontaneous natural window ventilation (+5.8%). Stricter ventilation targets are possible. The concept of the intervention is suitable for immediate adoption in schools with natural window ventilation for a limited period, pending the installation of a mechanical ventilation system. The easy integration of this intervention into everyday school life promotes compliance, which is particularly important during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Vassella, Claudia C; Koch, Jeremy; Henzi, Alexander; Jordan, Alexander; Waeber, Roger; Iannaccone, Reto; Charrière, Roland",International journal of hygiene and environmental health,102,8

Methods Fifty adult patients undergoing elective video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy or pneumonectomy were enrolled. Group 1 patients (n = 25) were first maintained in normocarbia (PaCO2: 38 - 42 mmHg) for 30 min and then in hypercarbia (45 - 50 mmHg). In group 2 patients (n = 25), PaCO2 was maintained in the reverse order. Arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO2), respiratory variables, hemodynamic variables, and hemoglobin concentration were compared during normocarbia and hypercarbia. Arterial O2 content and O2 delivery were calculated. Results PaO2 values during normocarbia and hypercarbia were 66.5 ± 10.6 mmHg and 79.7 ± 17.3 mmHg, respectively, (mean difference: 13.2 mmHg, 95% CI for difference of means: 17.0 to 9.3, P < 0.001). SaO2 values during normocarbia and hypercarbia were 92.5 ± 4.8% and 94.3 ± 3.1% (P = 0.009), respectively. Static compliance of the lung (33.0 ± 5.4 vs. 30.4 ± 5.3 mL/cmH2O, P < 0.001), arterial O2 content (15.4 ± 1.4 vs. 14.9 ± 1.5 mL/dL, P < 0.001) and O2 delivery (69.9 ± 18.4 vs. 65.1 ± 18.1 mL/min, P <0.001) were significantly higher during hypercarbia than during normocarbia. Conclusions Hypercarbia increases PaO2 and O2 carrying capacity and improves pulmonary mechanics during OLV, suggesting that it may be helpful to manage oxygenation during OLV. Therefore, permissive hypercarbia may be a simple and valuable modality to manage arterial oxygenation during OLV.","Lee, Junho; Kim, Yesull; Mun, Juhan; Lee, Joseph; Ko, Seonghoon",Korean journal of anesthesiology,102,1

The growing literature of adverse suture material reactions provided the objective of this study, to use in vitro assays to quantify levels of inflammation produced by seven commonly used suture materials in surgical procedures. METHODS Human monocyte/macrophage THP-1 cells were exposed to suture materials for 1, 3 and 5 days. Gene expression and protein secretion of six inflammatory cytokines and two cell surface markers were assessed using qPCR and ELISA respectively, with LPS exposure providing a positive control. Furthermore, a IL-1β/IL-1RA marker ratio was assessed to determine the balance between pro-/anti-inflammatory expression. RESULTS The findings from our in vitro study suggest that four commonly used suture materials cause upregulation of pro-inflammatory markers indicative of an early foreign body reaction, with no balance from anti-inflammatory markers. CONCLUSIONS As prolonged early pro-inflammation is known to produce delayed wound healing responses, the knowledge produced from this study has potential to improve informed surgical decision making and patient safety. This work has the capability to reduce suture-related adverse immune reactions, and therefore positively affect patient outcomes.","Lock, Alistair M; Gao, Ryan; Naot, Dorit; Coleman, Brendan; Cornish, Jillian; Musson, David S",Patient safety in surgery,102,1

In addition, the effect of a percutaneous heel cord lengthening (HCL) during TAA on ankle motion is poorly understood. METHODS A total of 357 primary TAAs treated with a 3-component device (336 patients, mean age 62.6 [24-85] years) performed between May 2003 and November 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. Sagittal ankle ROM was assessed according to a previously published protocol preoperatively (PreOP), 1 year postoperatively (PostOP), and at the last available follow-up (LastFU). Pain assessed on a visual analog scale (VAS) was assessed at the same time points. The effect of a percutaneous HCL on ankle ROM and VAS for pain was also evaluated. RESULTS Preoperative ankle ROM increased from mean 31.3 (0-69) to 33.9 (5-65) degrees 1 year postoperatively (P = .0002) and decreased to 31.9 (5-70) degrees at the LastFU (P = .007). Percutaneous HCL showed no effect on ankle ROM development after TAA (P = .141). Ankle ROM improvement after TAA (PreOP to LastFU) was higher in ankles with lower preoperative ankle motion (P < .0001). A lower ankle ROM at the last follow-up tended to be associated with a higher pain level (P = .056). CONCLUSION Although ankles with a lower preoperative sagittal ROM gained motion, the current data suggest that TAA has little potential to increase the preoperative available ankle motion. In some patients with a high preoperative ankle ROM, a slight decrease of ankle motion was observed postoperatively. Patients with limited ankle motion at long-term follow-up tended toward experiencing higher pain levels. The short- and long-term effect of a percutaneous HCL on ankle ROM following TAA was minimal.

Our aim was to compare LESS simple nephrectomy (LESS-SN) and conventional transperitoneal laparoscopic simple nephrectomy (CTL-SN). PATIENTS AND METHODS In this randomized study that was conducted between December 2008 and September 2009, 27 patients who needed simple nephrectomy were randomized to either LESS-SN or CTL-SN. All procedures in both groups were performed by the first author, who is experienced in laparoscopic surgery. Patient characteristics, perioperative details, and time to return to work were recorded. Postoperative evaluation of pain and use of analgesic medication were recorded. RESULTS There was no difference in median operative time (117.5 vs 114 min, P = 0.52), blood loss (50.71 vs 47.15 mL, P = 0.60), transfusion rates (0% for both), and hospitalization time (2.07 vs 2.11 days, P = 0.74) between the LESS-SN and CTL-SN groups. Time to return to normal activities was shorter in the LESS-SN group compared with the CTL-SN group (10.7 vs 13.5 days, P = 0.001). Both the visual analogue scale and the postoperative use of analgesics were significantly lower during postoperative days 1, 2, and 3 in patients who underwent LESS-SN, compared with patients who underwent CTL-SN. There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications in both groups. Compared with CTL-SN, LESS-SN was more expensive, but all patients undergoing LESS-SN were very pleased with the cosmetic outcome (no visible scars). CONCLUSION The early experience described in this study suggests that LESS-SN is a safe and effective alternative to CTL-SN that provides surgeons with a minimally invasive surgical option and the ability to hide the surgical incision within the umbilicus; however, a larger series is necessary to confirm these findings and to determine if there are any benefits in pain, recovery, or cosmesis.","Tugcu, Volkan; Ilbey, Yusuf Ozlem; Mutlu, Bircan; Tasci, Ali Ihsan",Journal of endourology,102,1

There has been an attempt to move towards a paperless electronic system in many public healthcare facilities, but owing to lack of funding, this has been a challenge to achieve. During the current COVID-19 pandemic, the virus could be transmitted through the physical manipulation of patient records by various categories of staff who handle the records with or without gloves for protection. We discuss a digital option that has been partially used at Tygerberg Hospital (TBH), Cape Town, to avoid SARS-CoV-2 patient hard-copy record manipulation. It includes assignment of a QR code to every patient admitted as a person under investigation or confirmed COVID-19 case. The QR code is synced to one of the many free online medical notes smartphone applications (apps), which are password-protected with patient information privacy regulations (Trello is used at TBH), for daily medical notes review and editing. Upon discharge, all notes made during the patient's hospital stay, together with the discharge summary, are printed to generate a hard copy of notes for filing to avoid violation of the current national and provincial patient records policy. Doing this means that a patient will have a virtual online file through the designated app until discharge, when a physical file will be made for storage and safekeeping. It will keep physical manipulation of patient records to the minimum, and potentially assist in reducing transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus among healthcare workers.","Ntshalintshali, S; Mnqwazi, C",South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,102,19

Currently, no effective vaccines are available for pathogens with a highly variable antigenic load, such as the Human Immunodeficiency Virus or to induce cellular T cell immunity in the fight against cancer. The recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has reinforced the relevance of designing smart therapeutic vaccine modalities to ensure public health. Indeed, academic and private companies have ongoing joint efforts to develop novel vaccine prototypes for this virus. Many pathogens are covered by a dense glycan-coat, which form an attractive target for vaccine development. Moreover, many tumor types are characterized by altered glycosylation profiles that are known as 'tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens' (TACA). Unfortunately, glycans do not provoke a vigorous immune response and generally serve as T cell-independent antigens, not eliciting protective IgG responses nor inducing immunological memory. A close and continuous crosstalk between glycochemists and glycoimmunologists is essential for the successful development of efficient immune modulators. It is clear that this is a key point for the discovery of novel approaches, which could significantly improve our understanding of the immune system. In this review, we discuss the latest advancements in development of vaccines against glycan epitopes to gain selective immune responses, and to provide an overview on the role of different immunogenic constructs in improving glycovaccine efficacy.","Anderluh, Marko; Berti, Francesco; Bzducha-Wróbel, Anna; Chiodo, Fabrizio; Colombo, Cinzia; Compostella, Federica; Durlik, Katarzyna; Ferhati, Xhenti; Holmdahl, Rikard; Jovanovic, Dragana; Kaca, Wieslaw; Lay, Luigi; Marinovic-Cincovic, Milena; Marradi, Marco; Ozil, Musa; Polito, Laura; Reina, Josè Juan; Reis, Celso A; Sackstein, Robert; Silipo, Alba; Švajger, Urban; Vaněk, Ondřej; Yamamoto, Fumiichiro; Richichi, Barbara; van Vliet, Sandra J",The FEBS journal,102,2

In a previous trial, post-hoc analysis indicated that NASHA provides significantly greater pain relief than saline in patients with OA confined to the study knee. We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of NASHA in patients with unilateral knee OA. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS This was a randomized, double-blind, saline-controlled trial. All patients had knee OA confirmed by American College of Rheumatology criteria and a WOMAC pain score of 7-17 in the study knee, but no pain in the previous 3 months in the non-study knee. Treatment comprised a single intra-articular injection of NASHA or saline control. The follow-up period was 6 weeks. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01806207. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary efficacy endpoint was the responder rate, defined as the percentage of patients with ≥40% improvement from baseline in WOMAC pain score and an absolute improvement of ≥5 points. RESULTS A total of 218 patients received study treatment (NASHA: 108, saline: 110). In the main intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, no statistically significant difference in responder rate was found between the two groups at 6 weeks (NASHA: 30.6%; saline: 26.4%). A post-hoc subgroup analysis of patients without clinical effusion in the study knee at baseline showed a significantly higher 6 week responder rate with NASHA than with saline: 40.6% versus 19.7% (p = 0.0084). A total of 68 adverse events were reported among 44 patients in the NASHA group, compared with 69 adverse events among 44 patients in the saline group. The main weakness of the study was the short, 6 week follow-up duration. In addition, image guidance was not used to ensure injection as intended into the intra-articular space. CONCLUSIONS Single-injection NASHA was well tolerated and, although there was no significant benefit versus saline control in the primary analysis, post-hoc analysis showed a statistically significant improvement in pain relief at 6 weeks among patients without clinical effusion at baseline.","Arden, Nigel K; Åkermark, Christian; Andersson, Mats; Todman, Martin G; Altman, Roy D",Current medical research and opinion,102,1

Ovarian tumor (OTU) domain proteases from nairoviruses and arteriviruses were recently found to remove these molecules from host proteins, which inhibits Ub and ISG15-dependent antiviral pathways. This contrasts with the Ub-specific activity of known eukaryotic OTU-domain proteases. Here we describe crystal structures of a viral OTU domain from the highly pathogenic Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) bound to Ub and to ISG15 at 2.5-Å and 2.3-Å resolution, respectively. The complexes provide a unique structural example of ISG15 bound to another protein and reveal the molecular mechanism of an ISG15 cross-reactive deubiquitinase. To accommodate structural differences between Ub and ISG15, the viral protease binds the β-grasp folds of Ub and C-terminal Ub-like domain of ISG15 in an orientation that is rotated nearly 75° with respect to that observed for Ub bound to a representative eukaryotic OTU domain from yeast. Distinct structural determinants necessary for binding either substrate were identified and allowed the reengineering of the viral OTU protease into enzymes with increased substrate specificity, either for Ub or for ISG15. Our findings now provide the basis to determine in vivo the relative contributions of deubiquitination and deISGylation to viral immune evasion tactics, and a structural template of a promiscuous deubiquitinase from a haemorrhagic fever virus that can be targeted for inhibition using small-molecule-based strategies.","James, Terrence W; Frias-Staheli, Natalia; Bacik, John-Paul; Levingston Macleod, Jesica M; Khajehpour, Mazdak; García-Sastre, Adolfo; Mark, Brian L",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,102,7

METHODS EHR data for children were linked to the EHR data of adults living at the same address during the same time in a retrospective cohort study from 2006 to 2014 to evaluate associations between adult and child CM and CBH conditions within a Boston safety-net primary care patient sample. RESULTS Of the 13,845 included children, 61.6% lived with at least one adult with ≥ 1 CM or CBH condition. Compared to children living with an adult(s) without a chronic condition, children living with an adult with a CM or CBH condition had a respective 16.2% and 18.1% increased likelihood of having a chronic condition themselves, with multiple adult chronic conditions in adults increasing children's likelihood. CONCLUSIONS FOR PRACTICE We found a positive association between the chronic diseases of adult and child household members.

MATERIAL AND METHODS The latest available literature was reviewed until October 30, 2020 from the PubMed database. RESULTS The literature reports that vitamin D has immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects. It reduces the expression of cytokines such as IL-6, TNF-α and INF-γ, regulates the activity of T helper lymphocytes, and other elements of the immune system at the molecular level. The deficiency of this vitamin promotes the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, contributing to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome. The severity of the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection depends on comorbidities, the development and course of which may also be affected by vitamin D levels (coagulopathies, pulmonary, cardiological, metabolic diseases). Most of the analyzed research studies from different countries indicated a relationship between insufficient vitamin D levels and a more severe course of COVID-19 and an increase in mortality due to it, especially among the elderly. Researchers agree that further analyzes are necessary concerning both the influence of the vitamin D blood serum levels on the morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19 as well as the use of its supplementation in the struggle against SARS-CoV-2 virus. There are reports of possible beneficial interactions of vitamin D with other substances, such as quercetin, estradiol, some microelements, and other vitamins. CONCLUSIONS Maintaining an adequate level of vitamin D has a positive effect on the functioning of the immune system. At the moment, there is insufficient evidence to establish a clear relationship between vitamin D levels and the severity of COVID-19. It is necessary to conduct further research on a larger study group. The literature does not mention the use of vitamin D as a medication for COVID-19. People at risk of vitamin D deficiency should consider vitamin D supplementation at the current time of the pandemic.","Ręka, Gabriela; Korzeniowska, Anna; Machowiec, Piotr; Maksymowicz, Marcela; Piecewicz-Szczęsna, Halina",Przeglad epidemiologiczny,102,5

Through a comprehensive literature search of PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar from inception to March 2016, we identified randomized controlled trials of ICS therapy lasting at least 6 months. A meta-analysis by the Peto approach was also conducted to generate summary estimates comparing ICS with non-ICS treatment on the risk of URTI. A total of 14 studies involving 19,777 subjects were considered in the meta-analysis. Compared with non-ICS treatment, ICS were associated with a significantly increased risk of URTI (Peto OR: 1.16; 95% CI: 1.05-1.29; I2 = 9%; p = .004). Subgroup analyzes were performed for different dose, high-dose ICS was associated with a significantly increased risk of URTI (Peto OR: 1.19; 95% CI: 1.05-1.34; I2 = 0%; p = .005), whereas low-dose ICS showed a non-significant increased risk of URTI (Peto OR: 1.10; 95% CI: 0.91-1.33; I2 = 0%; p = .32). Moreover, fluticasone was observed with an increased risk of URTI but not mometasone; high-dose fluticasone treatment was associated with a significantly higher risk of URTI but not low-dose. These results suggested to us that ICS use may increase the risk of URTI in patients with COPD, but it should be further investigated.","Yang, Mingjin; Chen, Hong; Zhang, Yan; Du, Yuejun; Xu, Ying; Jiang, Ping; Xu, Zhibo",Inhalation toxicology,102,1

Methods This cross-sectional observational study compared illness beliefs, treatment beliefs, and treatment satisfaction of patients with TTR >75% and TTR <50% using validated tools to determine their association with TTR. Adults requiring chronic VKA therapy were recruited from 2 hospital anticoagulation clinics in London, UK. Results 311 patients with TTR >75% and 214 with TTR <50% were recruited. TTR >75% patients had been taking warfarin on average over 2 years longer than TTR <50% patients (P < .001). Statistically significant differences in beliefs were found in all subscales other than in treatment control, general harm, and general overuse. Cluster analysis determined there were 4 distinct clusters of beliefs among patients. Multivariate binary logistic regression found VTE patients were least likely to have poor TTR (OR = 0.49; 95% CI 0.29, 0.77). Patients in the ""cautious of therapy and fearful of illness"" cluster were most likely to have low TTR (OR = 4.75; 95% CI 2.75, 8.77). Conclusion Illness perceptions, medication beliefs and treatment satisfaction were associated with INR control. VTE patients and those who were accepting of both illness and treatment were most likely to have optimal INR control.","Bartoli-Abdou, John K; Patel, Jignesh P; Xie, Rosa; Dzahini, Olubanke; Vadher, Bipin; Brown, Alison; Roberts, Lara N; Patel, Raj K; Arya, Roopen; Auyeung, Vivian",Research and practice in thrombosis and haemostasis,102,30

The investigated variables were the difference between MAP at baseline and average MAP during GA (ΔMAP) as well as the difference between baseline MAP and the lowest MAP during GA (ΔLMAP). Their association with a shift towards better outcome on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) after 90 days was determined using ordinal logistic regression with adjustment for prognostic baseline variables. RESULTS Sixty of the 85 patients treated under GA in MR CLEAN had sufficient anesthetic information available for the analysis. A greater ΔMAP was associated with worse outcome (adjusted common OR (acOR) 0.95 per point mm Hg, 95% CI 0.92 to 0.99). An average MAP during GA 10 mm Hg lower than baseline MAP constituted a 1.67 times lower odds of a shift towards good outcome on the mRS. For ΔLMAP this association was not significant (acOR 0.97 per mm Hg, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.00, p=0.09). CONCLUSIONS A decrease in MAP during intervention under GA compared with baseline is associated with worse outcome.

The Wavelet-based Anesthetic Value for Central Nervous System (WAVCNS) index calculated by this monitor is based on wavelet analysis of a normalized electroencephalogram signal in the γ-frequency band. The aim of this study was to determine the extent of disagreement between the Bispectral Index (BIS) and the WAVCNS index during propofol-based and sevoflurane-based maintenance of general anesthesia in a routine surgical population. METHODS Patients undergoing elective surgery were enrolled in the study and randomly assigned to receive either propofol or sevoflurane for the maintenance of anesthesia and remifentanil in both groups. Anesthesiologists were blinded to monitors in both groups. Discordance between the 2 monitors was assessed by the count of discrepancy in recommendation (DR) (type 1 defined as one parameter <40 and the other >60, or type 2 defined as BIS and WAVCNS values on different sides of a threshold [40 or 60]) and also by the proportion of agreement (P0) between WAVCNS and BIS, obtained every 5 seconds, in 3 categories of index (<40, 40-60, and >60). RESULTS The analyzed data set consisted of 22 patients (36,872 data pairs) in the propofol group and 24 patients (32,826 data pairs) in the sevoflurane group. The type 1 DR rarely occurred in both the groups (<1%); however, the median (interquartile range) type 2 DR was significantly more frequent in the propofol group (20.6% [7.0-36.9] vs 4.5% [2.3-12.4]; P = 0.0005). The median difference in P0 was 11.53% (95% confidence interval, 0.57-21.32). Major disagreement between WAVCNS index and BIS was related to the weight of burst suppression pattern for the index calculation. CONCLUSIONS Disagreement between BIS and NeuroSENSE during the maintenance of general anesthesia was worse in the propofol group than that in the sevoflurane groups. The disagreement increases during deep anesthesia or in the occurrence of burst suppression.","Bresson, Julie; Gayat, Etienne; Agrawal, Gracee; Chazot, Thierry; Liu, Ngai; Hausser-Haw, Chantal; Fischler, Marc",Anesthesia and analgesia,102,7

This study was conducted to identify the incidence and types of complications related to gastrotomy creation with the needle knife puncture and balloon dilatation technique for NOTES access to the peritoneal cavity. METHODS Between May 2007 and August 2008, transgastric procedures were performed in 76 swine at a single institution. A total of 58 gastrotomies were created using the needle knife puncture and balloon dilatation technique without laparoscopic observation and 18 gastrotomies were created under laparoscopic visualization after CO(2) insufflation through a laparoscopic port. In all cases, a needle knife with an electrosurgical current of 25-W coagulation and/or 25-W cut and a wire-guided endoscopic balloon dilated to 20 mm were used to create the gastrotomy. All complications were collected prospectively and reviewed from laboratory medical records, operative reports, and necropsy findings. RESULTS NOTES gastrotomy-related complications occurred in 10/76 (13.2%) animals. Major complications occurred in six animals (7.9%), including four splenic lacerations, a mesenteric tear, and a fatal diaphragmatic injury. Minor complications occurred in four animals (5.3%), including three abdominal wall injuries and minor gastrotomy site bleeding. When pregastrotomy laparoscopic guidance was used, only one injury occurred in 18 animals (5.5%), but 9/58 (15.5%) gastrotomies performed without laparoscopic visualization caused some type of injury. The difference in rate of injury did not achieve statistical significance. No learning curve effect could be identified. CONCLUSIONS Injuries to adjacent viscera occur more often than is reported with the traditional transgastric needle knife NOTES access technique. Gastric punctures should be made either with laparoscopic visualization or by other techniques such as the PEG approach or with noncutting devices to reduce the incidence of visceral injury associated with transgastric peritoneal entry.","Sohn, Dae Kyung; Turner, Brian G; Gee, Denise W; Willingham, Field F; Sylla, Patricia; Cizginer, Sevdenur; Konuk, Yusuf; Brugge, William R; Rattner, David W",Surgical endoscopy,102,1

METHODS This was a cross-sectional study recruiting 120 pregnant women. The study was conducted at the outpatient clinic of a tertiary hospital. We recruited women attending for antenatal care. Anxiety was evaluated using an Arabic validated Kuwait University Anxiety Scale (KUAS). Depression was evaluated using a validated Arabic form of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). RESULTS The study included 48 (40%) nulliparous and 72 (60%) multiparous women. The mean KUAS scores for nulliparous and multiparous women were 45.27±10.78 and 47.28±10.62. Both nulliparous and multiparous women had a fairly high possibility of depression. Fifty-three (44.2%) of them reported scores ≥ of 14. Ninety-three (77.5%) women thought that COVID-19 pandemic would affect their pregnancies. There was a significant association between the number of women reporting fear related to the COVID-19 pandemic and their KUAS and EPDS scores (p-value <0.001 each).

With improvements in real-time arterial imaging, modern AIS treatment demands a structural approach based upon the level of cerebrovascular occlusion. The poor concordance of presenting National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) with vessel occlusion in recent trials bespeaks the need for an anatomic perspective. Specifically, patients with large-vessel occlusion (LVO) represent a distinct entity with a poorer prognosis than general AIS patients. Ongoing clinical trials and therapeutic strategies must recognize the varied natural history of AIS patients.

Initial angiographic and clinical outcomes were excellent. The final results are presented herein. METHODS AMERICA is a multicenter, prospective single-arm trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of the ev3 Axium MicroFX coil system in 100 separate aneurysms between April 2010 and October 2012. Trial endpoints were 3-6 month angiographic occlusion and clinical status, as reported by treatment center. RESULTS Mean follow-up was 157.9 days (median 153.5, range 1-445, SEM 9.3 days). At last follow-up imaging, 90.6% of all aneurysms, 90% of unruptured aneurysms, and 93.3% of ruptured aneurysms had Raymond grade I or II occlusion. Progression to further occlusion (lower Raymond occlusion grade) occurred in 29/85 aneurysms (34.1%). Aneurysm recurrence occurred in 11/85 aneurysms (12.9%). Ninety-nine per cent of patients treated electively and 68.7% of ruptured patients had a modified Rankin score of 0-2. Delayed adverse events (AEs), occurring after discharge and during the follow-up period, occurred in 10% of patients. In total, two AEs (one severe and one moderate) were potentially related to the device, thereby providing a 2% device-related AE rate. CONCLUSIONS In this prospective, multicenter series of 100 aneurysms treated with Axium MicroFX PGLA (polyglycolic/polylactic acid) coils, 3-6 month angiographic occlusion and clinical outcomes were excellent. This study suggests that Axium MicroFX PGLA coils are safe and effective in the treatment of intracranial aneurysms.","Fargen, Kyle M; Blackburn, Spiros; Deshaies, Eric M; Carpenter, Jeffrey S; Jabbour, Pascal; Mack, William J; Rai, Ansaar T; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Turner, Raymond D; Mocco, J",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,102,24

AIM To evaluate whether an electronic frailty index based on routine primary care data can be used as a measure for daily functioning in research with community-dwelling older persons (aged ≥75 years). DESIGN AND SETTING Cohort study among participants of the Integrated Systemic Care for Older People (ISCOPE) trial (11 476 eligible; 7285 in observational cohort; 3141 in trial; over-representation of frail people). METHOD At baseline (T0) and after 12 months (T12), daily functioning was measured with the Groningen Activities Restriction Scale (GARS, range 18-72). Electronic frailty index scores (range 0-1) at T0 and T12 were computed from the EHRs. The electronic frailty index (electronic Frailty Index - Utrecht) was tested for responsiveness and compared with the GARS as a gold standard for daily functioning. RESULTS In total, 1390 participants with complete EHR and follow-up data were selected (31.4% male; median age = 81 years, interquartile range = 78-85). The electronic frailty index increased with age, was higher for females, and lower for participants living with a partner. It was responsive after an acute major medical event; however, the correlation between the electronic frailty index and GARS at T0 and over time was limited. CONCLUSION Because the electronic frailty index does not reflect daily functioning, further research on new methods to measure daily functioning with routine care data (for example, other proxies) is needed before EHRs can be a useful data source for research with older persons.","Ravensbergen, Willeke M; Blom, Jeanet W; Evers, Andrea Wm; Numans, Mattijs E; de Waal, Margot Wm; Gussekloo, Jacobijn",The British journal of general practice : the journal of the Royal College of General Practitioners,102,13

RECENT FINDINGS Several, but not all, studies examining disasters including earthquake-affected communities and refugee populations have found increased incidence of PSDs. Studies have been inconsistent regarding psychosis incidence in COVID-19 patients. Meanwhile, patients with PSD have been found to cope poorly in recent disasters including flooding and a nuclear accident. Patients with schizophrenia appear to be at particular risk during COVID-19 due to such issues as poor awareness of health precautions and the psychiatric impact of lockdown. However, novel methods including telepsychiatry have allowed care of this population to remain consistent during COVID-19. SUMMARY There is conflicting evidence as to the association between disasters and onset of PSD, and further study is needed to elucidate this link. Patients with PSDs are more likely to fare worse during disasters. Novel approaches to delivery of care have helped offset the psychiatric risks to PSD patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. These approaches may be applicable to other disaster scenarios or to general outpatient care.","Jing, Genevieve P; Katz, Craig L",Current opinion in psychiatry,102,1

The promise and potential of these applications are hindered by the lack of an efficient means of isolation, characterization, and quantitation. Current methods for exosome and EV isolation (including ultracentrifugation, microfiltration, and affinity-based techniques) result in impure recoveries with regard to remnant matrix species (e.g., proteins, genetic material) and are performed on clinically irrelevant time and volume scales. To address these issues, a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) capillary-channeled polymer (C-CP) fiber stationary phase is employed for the solid-phase extraction (SPE) of EVs from various matrices using a micropipette tip-based format. The hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) processing and a spin-down workflow are carried out using a table-top centrifuge. Capture and subsequent elution of intact, biologically active exosomes are verified via electron microscopy and bioassays. The performance of this method was evaluated by capture and elution of exosome standards from buffer solution and three biologically relevant matrices: mock urine, reconstituted non-fat milk, and exosome-depleted fetal bovine serum (FBS). Recoveries were evaluated using UV-Vis absorbance spectrophotometry and ELISA assay. The dynamic binding capacity (50%) for the 1-cm-long (~ 5 μL bed volume) tips was determined using a commercial exosome product, yielding a value of ~ 7 × 1011 particles. The novel C-CP fiber spin-down tip approach holds promise for the isolation of exosomes and other EVs from various matrices with high throughput, low cost, and high efficiency.

Several methods have been proposed, but findings can vary in specific groups such as patients with diabetes, elderly and high and low body mass index and, also, with the stage of CKD. The objective of this study was comparing the accuracy of the currently used equations for estimating GFR with that of the gold standard technetium-(99m)-diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (99mTc-DTPA). METHODS We performed a cross-sectional study of 129 patients with all five CKD stages. GFR was estimated using the following: 24-h urine creatinine clearance, Cockcroft-Gault equation, MDRD equation, CKD-EPI equation, Hoek's cystatin C equation, and isotopic 99mTc-DTPA (as gold standard). We evaluated agreement in the whole study population and according to age, sex, weight, and diabetes. RESULTS All methods had good agreement. The best agreement was observed with the cystatin C [intraclass coefficient correlation (ICC) 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI), 0.87 (0.82-0.91)], followed by CKD-EPI [ICC 0.83 (0.77-0.88)]. Twenty-four-hour urine creatinine clearance showed the worst agreement in patients older than 65 years [ICC 0.70 (0.56-0.79)]. The Cockcroft-Gault equation showed the worst agreement in younger than 65 years [ICC 0.64 (0.42-0.79)]. The best agreement for classification in the correct CKD stage was with the cystatin C equation [κ = 0.80 (0.74-0.87)]. GFR was overestimated with all methods in CKD stages 4 and 5. CONCLUSIONS The methods used in clinical practice are adequate for classification of CKD. Cystatin C is the most accurate method, followed by CKD-EPI. The Cockcroft-Gault equation is not accurate in young patients. Twenty-four-hour urine creatinine clearance loses accuracy in patients aged older than 65 years.","Vega, Almudena; García de Vinuesa, Soledad; Goicoechea, Marian; Verdalles, Ursula; Martínez-Pueyo, María Luz; Chacón, Ana; Quiroga, Borja; Luño, José",International urology and nephrology,102,1

METHODS Twenty patients with metastatic nonseminomatous testicular germ-cell tumor underwent extraperitoneal laparoscopic RPLND after chemotherapy. The procedure was not indicated for patients with a pre-chemotherapy mass larger than 5 cm. Morbidity and oncological outcome were reviewed retrospectively. Surgical complications were graded according to the Clavien classification system. RESULTS Laparoscopic RPLND was completed in all patients, and there was no conversion to open surgery. The median operating time was 223 min (range, 137-399 min). The median blood loss was 20 ml (range, 10-520 ml). There were no intraoperative complications. Postoperatively, 4 patients (20 %) had prolonged lymphorrhea (grade I) and 9 (45 %) had chyle leakage (grade I). Histological examination of the residual mass revealed necrosis in 16 (80 %) and the presence of teratoma with/without viable tumor in 4 (20 %). With a median follow-up of 45 months (range, 24-112), no patient has had disease recurrence. Normal antegrade ejaculation was preserved in all of the 14 patients studied. CONCLUSIONS Extraperitoneal laparoscopic RPLND can be performed with acceptable morbidity and excellent cancer control in select patients. Surgeons should be aware of relatively high incidence of chyle leakage following this procedure.","Arai, Yoichi; Kaiho, Yasuhiro; Yamada, Shigeyuki; Saito, Hideo; Mitsuzuka, Koji; Yamashita, Shinichi; Namiki, Shunichi; Nakagawa, Haruo; Ishidoya, Shigeto; Ito, Akihiro",International urology and nephrology,102,24

This paper proposes a novel automated method for accurate assessing of the level of hypnosis with sevoflurane in 17 patients using the electroencephalogram signal. In this method, a set of distinctive features and a hierarchical classification structure based on support vector machine (SVM) methods, is proposed to discriminate the four levels of anesthesia (awake, light, general and deep states). The first stage of the hierarchical SVM structure identifies the awake state by extracting Shannon Permutation Entropy, Detrended Fluctuation Analysis and frequency features. Then deep state is identified by extracting the sample entropy feature; and finally light and general states are identified by extracting the three mentioned features of the first step. The accuracy of the proposed method of analyzing the brain activity during anesthesia is 94.11%; which was better than previous studies and also a commercial monitoring system (Response Entropy Index).","Shalbaf, Ahmad; Shalbaf, Reza; Saffar, Mohsen; Sleigh, Jamie",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,102,1

RESULTS After reviewing 18 671 database citations and 10 988 grey literature citations, 18 citations describing 11 decision aids remained. Decision aids targeted premature infants, children requiring airway management, children with cancer and children with scoliosis. Three aids underwent testing beyond initial development. Quality scores averaged 27 of 50 points. CONCLUSIONS There are few high-quality decision aids available for use and a lack evidence of widespread clinical use. Additional research is needed to support systematic development and the use of decision aids with families.","Medeiros, Christina; Buckley, Laura; Metcalfe, Kelly; Narayanan, Unni G; Widger, Kimberley",Journal of paediatrics and child health,102,1

Though the host shutoff may facilitate reallocation of cellular resources for viral replication and evasion of host antiviral immune responses, it poses a challenge for continuous synthesis of cellular proteins that are important for viral replication. It is, however, unclear whether and how certain cellular proteins may be selectively synthesized during the vaccinia virus-induced host shutoff. Using simultaneous RNA sequencing and ribosome profiling, two techniques quantifying genome-wide levels of mRNA and active protein translation, respectively, we analyzed the responses of host cells to vaccinia virus infection at both the transcriptional and translational levels. The analyses showed that cellular mRNA depletion played a dominant role in the shutoff of host protein synthesis. Though the cellular mRNAs were significantly reduced, the relative translation efficiency of a subset of cellular mRNAs increased, particularly those involved in oxidative phosphorylation that are responsible for cellular energy production. Further experiments demonstrated that the protein levels and activities of oxidative phosphorylation increased during vaccinia virus infection, while inhibition of the cellular oxidative phosphorylation function significantly suppressed vaccinia virus replication. Moreover, the short 5' untranslated region of the oxidative phosphorylation mRNAs contributed to the translational upregulation. These results provide evidence of a mechanism that couples translational control and energy metabolism, two processes that all viruses depend on host cells to provide, to support vaccinia virus replication during a host shutoff.IMPORTANCE Many viral infections cause global host protein synthesis shutoff. While host protein synthesis shutoff benefits the virus by relocating cellular resources to viral replication, it also poses a challenge to the maintenance of cellular functions necessary for viral replication if continuous protein synthesis is required. Here we measured the host mRNA translation rate during a vaccinia virus-induced host shutoff by analyzing total and actively translating mRNAs in a genome-wide manner. This study revealed that oxidative phosphorylation mRNAs were translationally upregulated during vaccinia virus-induced host protein synthesis shutoff. Oxidative phosphorylation is the major cellular energy-producing pathway, and we further showed that maintenance of its function is important for vaccinia virus replication. This study highlights the fact that vaccinia virus infection can enhance cellular energy production through translational upregulation in the context of an overall host protein synthesis shutoff to meet energy expenditure.","Dai, Aimei; Cao, Shuai; Dhungel, Pragyesh; Luan, Yizhao; Liu, Yizhi; Xie, Zhi; Yang, Zhilong",Journal of virology,102,1

In the Jiaokou Irrigation District, ionic concentrations, hydrogeochemistry, and fluoride contaminations were analyzed using correlation matrices, principal component analysis (PCA), and health risk assessment. The patterns for the average cation and anion concentrations were Na+ > Mg2+ > Ca2+ > K+ and SO42- > HCO3- > Cl- > NO3- > CO32-. The fluoride concentrations ranged between 0.29 and 8.92 mg/L (mean = 2.4 mg/L). 5% of the samples displayed lower than the recommended limit of 0.5 mg/L fluoride content, while 69% exceeded the allowable limits of 1.5 mg/L for drinking. The low F- content is distributed in a small part of the southeast, while elevated F- mainly in the central area of the study region. The PCA results indicated three principal components (PC), PC1 having the greatest variance (45.83%) and affected by positive loadings of TDS, Cl-, SO42-, Na+, and Mg2+, PC2 accounting for 17.03% and dominated by Ca2+, pH, HCO3-, and K+, and PC3 representing 12.17% and mainly comprising of CO32-. High fluoride groundwater is of the SO4-Cl-Na type, followed by HCO3-Na type. Evaporation and ion exchange play important roles in producing high fluoride groundwater. Furthermore, saturation index and anthropogenic activities also promote the high fluoride concentrations. The values of the total hazard quotient of 93% groundwater samples were greater than 1 for infants, followed by 85% for children, 68% for teenagers, and 57% for adults. Non-carcinogenic health risks to infants may occur over the entire study area, while for adults, health risks are mainly found in Weinan and Pucheng. High fluorine may have a potential negative influence on neurodevelopment, especially for infants and children. Adults in this region have serious dental fluorosis and skeletal fluorosis because of long-term drinking of high fluoride groundwater. Therefore, measures, including using organic fertilizers, strengthening defluoridation process, and optimizing water supply strategies, are necessary in this area.","Zhang, Qiying; Xu, Panpan; Qian, Hui; Yang, Faxuan",The Science of the total environment,102,1

The effect of AKI on the clinical outcomes of these two conditions is unclear. METHODS This retrospective, territory-wide cohort study used an electronic public healthcare database in Hong Kong to identify patients with SARS or COVID-19 by diagnosis codes, virologic results, or both. The primary endpoint was a composite of intensive care unit admission, use of invasive mechanical ventilation, and/or death. RESULTS We identified 1670 patients with SARS and 1040 patients with COVID-19 (median ages, 41 versus 35 years, respectively). Among patients with SARS, 26% met the primary endpoint versus 5.3% of those with COVID-19. Diabetes mellitus, abnormal liver function, and AKI were factors significantly associated with the primary endpoint among patients with either SARS or COVID-19. Among patients with SARS, 7.9%, 2.1%, and 3.7% developed stage 1, stage 2, and stage 3 AKI, respectively; among those with COVID-19, 6.6%, 0.4%, and 1.1% developed stage 1, stage 2, and stage 3 AKI, respectively. In both groups, factors significantly associated with AKI included diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Among patients with AKI, those with COVID-19 had a lower rate of major adverse clinical outcomes versus patients with SARS. Renal function recovery usually occurred within 30 days after an initial AKI event. CONCLUSIONS AKI rates were higher among patients with SARS than those with COVID-19. AKI was associated with major adverse clinical outcomes for both diseases. Patients with diabetes mellitus and abnormal liver function were also at risk of developing severe consequences after SARS and COVID-19 infection.","Teoh, Jeremy Yuen-Chun; Yip, Terry Cheuk-Fung; Lui, Grace Chung-Yan; Wong, Vincent Wai-Sun; Chow, Viola Chi-Ying; Ho, Tracy Hang-Yee; Li, Timothy Chun-Man; Tse, Yee-Kit; Chiu, Peter Ka-Fung; Ng, Chi-Fai; Hui, David Shu-Cheong; Chan, Henry Lik-Yuen; Szeto, Cheuk-Chun; Wong, Grace Lai-Hung",Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,102,1

Early Ebola virus (EBOV) seroconversion confers a survival advantage in natural infection, hence transfusion of ECP plasma with high levels of neutralizing EBOV antibodies is a potential passive immune therapy. Techniques to reduce the risk of other transfusion-transmitted infections (TTIs) are warranted as recent ECP survivors are ineligible as routine blood donors. As part of an ongoing clinical trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of ECP, the impact of amotosalen/UVA pathogen reduction technology (PRT) on EBOV antibody characteristics was examined. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Serum and plasma samples were collected from EVD-recovered subjects at multiple timepoints and evaluated by ELISA for antibodies to recombinant EBOV glycoprotein (GP) and irradiated whole EBOV antigen, as well as for EBOV microneutralization, classic plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) and EBOV pseudovirion neutralization assay (PsVNA) activity. RESULTS Six subjects donated 40 individual ECP units. Substantial antibody titers and neutralizing activity results were demonstrated but were generally lower for the ACD plasma samples compared to the serum samples. Anti-EBOV titers by all assays remained essentially unchanged after PRT. CONCLUSION Treatment of ECP with PRT to reduce the risk of TTI did not significantly reduce EBOV IgG antibody titers or neutralizing activity. Although ECP was used in the treatment of repatriated patients, no PRT units from this study were transfused to EVD patients. This inventory of PRT-treated ECP is currently available for future clinical evaluation.","Dean, Christina L; Hooper, Jay W; Dye, John M; Zak, Samantha E; Koepsell, Scott A; Corash, Laurence; Benjamin, Richard J; Kwilas, Steve; Bonds, Shannon; Winkler, Anne M; Kraft, Colleen S",Transfusion,102,19

No specific preventive or therapeutic agent of proven value against MERS-CoV is currently available. Public Health England and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium identified passive immunotherapy with neutralizing antibodies as a treatment approach that warrants priority study. Two experimental MERS-CoV vaccines were used to vaccinate two groups of transchromosomic (Tc) bovines that were genetically modified to produce large quantities of fully human polyclonal immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. Vaccination with a clade A γ-irradiated whole killed virion vaccine (Jordan strain) or a clade B spike protein nanoparticle vaccine (Al-Hasa strain) resulted in Tc bovine sera with high enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and neutralizing antibody titers in vitro. Two purified Tc bovine human IgG immunoglobulins (Tc hIgG), SAB-300 (produced after Jordan strain vaccination) and SAB-301 (produced after Al-Hasa strain vaccination), also had high ELISA and neutralizing antibody titers without antibody-dependent enhancement in vitro. SAB-301 was selected for in vivo and preclinical studies. Administration of single doses of SAB-301 12 hours before or 24 and 48 hours after MERS-CoV infection (Erasmus Medical Center 2012 strain) of Ad5-hDPP4 receptor-transduced mice rapidly resulted in viral lung titers near or below the limit of detection. Tc bovines, combined with the ability to quickly produce Tc hIgG and develop in vitro assays and animal model(s), potentially offer a platform to rapidly produce a therapeutic to prevent and/or treat MERS-CoV infection and/or other emerging infectious diseases.","Luke, Thomas; Wu, Hua; Zhao, Jincun; Channappanavar, Rudragouda; Coleman, Christopher M; Jiao, Jin-An; Matsushita, Hiroaki; Liu, Ye; Postnikova, Elena N; Ork, Britini L; Glenn, Gregory; Flyer, David; Defang, Gabriel; Raviprakash, Kanakatte; Kochel, Tadeusz; Wang, Jonathan; Nie, Wensheng; Smith, Gale; Hensley, Lisa E; Olinger, Gene G; Kuhn, Jens H; Holbrook, Michael R; Johnson, Reed F; Perlman, Stanley; Sullivan, Eddie; Frieman, Matthew B",Science translational medicine,102,16

137695,137695,137695,Will We Be Ready for the Next War?,12.910949,8.712116,2015,"BACKGROUND Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by arterial or venous thrombosis (or both) and/or pregnancy morbidity in association with the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies. The prevalence is estimated at 40 to 50 cases per 100,000 people. The most common sites of thrombosis are cerebral arteries and deep veins of the lower limbs. People with a definite APS diagnosis have an increased lifetime risk of recurrent thrombotic events. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of antiplatelet or anticoagulant agents, or both, for the secondary prevention of recurrent thrombosis, particularly ischemic stroke, in people with antiphospholipid syndrome. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (February 2017), CENTRAL (last search February 2017), MEDLINE (from 1948 to February 2017), Embase (from 1980 to February 2017), and several ongoing trials registers. We also checked the reference lists of included studies, systematic reviews, and practice guidelines, and we contacted experts in the field. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated any anticoagulant or antiplatelet agent, or both, in the secondary prevention of thrombosis in people diagnosed with APS according to the criteria valid when the study took place. We did not include studies specifically addressing women with obstetrical APS. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Pairs of review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias for the included studies. We resolved any discrepancies through discussion or by consulting a third review author and, in addition, one review author checked all the extracted data. MAIN RESULTS We included five studies involving 419 randomized participants with APS. Only one study was at low risk of bias in all domains. One study was at low risk of bias in all domains for objective outcomes but not for quality of life (measured using the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire). We judged the other three studies to be at unclear or high risk of bias in three or more domains.The duration of intervention ranged from 180 days to a mean of 3.9 years. One study compared rivaroxaban (a novel oral anticoagulant: NOAC) with standard warfarin treatment and reported no thrombotic or major bleeding events, but it was not powered to detect such differences (low-quality evidence). Investigators reported similar rates of clinically relevant non-major bleeding (risk ratio (RR) 1.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.25 to 8.33; moderate-quality evidence) and minor bleeding (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.51 to 2.83) for participants receiving rivaroxaban and the standard vitamin K antagonists (VKA). This study also reported some small benefit with rivaroxaban over the standard VKA treatment in terms of quality of life health state measured at 180 days with the EQ-5D-5L 100 mm visual analogue scale (mean difference (MD) 7 mm, 95% CI 2.01 to 11.99; low-quality evidence) but not measured as health utility (MD 0.04, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.10 [on a scale from 0 to 1]).Two studies compared high dose VKA (warfarin) with moderate/standard intensity VKA and found no differences in the rates of any thrombotic events (RR 2.22, 95% CI 0.79 to 6.23) or major bleeding (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.24 to 2.25) between the groups (low-quality evidence). Minor bleeding analyzed using the RR and any bleeding using the hazard ratio (HR) were more frequent in participants receiving high-intensity warfarin treatment compared to the standard-intensity therapy (RR 2.55, 95% CI 1.07 to 6.07; and HR 2.03, 95% CI 1.12 to 3.68; low-quality evidence).In one study, it was not possible to estimate the RR for stroke with a combination of VKA plus antiplatelet agent compared to a single antiplatelet agent, while for major bleeding, a single event occurred in the single antiplatelet agent group. In one study, comparing combined VKA plus antiplatelet agent with dual antiplatelet therapy, the RR of the risk of stroke over three years of observation was 5.00 (95% CI 0.26 to 98.0). In a single small study, the RR for stroke during one year of observation with a dual antiplatelet therapy compared to single antiplatelet drug was 0.14 (95% CI 0.01 to 2.60). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS There is not enough evidence for or against NOACs or for high-intensity VKA compared to the standard VKA therapy in the secondary prevention of thrombosis in people with APS. There is some evidence of harm for high-intensity VKA regarding minor and any bleeding. The evidence was also not sufficient to show benefit or harm for VKA plus antiplatelet agent or dual antiplatelet therapy compared to a single antiplatelet drug. Future studies should be adequately powered, with proper adherence to treatment, in order to evaluate the effects of anticoagulants, antiplatelets, or both, for secondary thrombosis prevention in APS. We have identified five ongoing trials mainly using NOACs in APS, so increasing experimental efforts are likely to yield additional evidence of clinical relevance in the near future.","Bala, Malgorzata M; Celinska-Lowenhoff, Magdalena; Szot, Wojciech; Padjas, Agnieszka; Kaczmarczyk, Mateusz; Swierz, Mateusz J; Undas, Anetta",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,102,1

It is a fatty acid salt obtained from the reaction of a strong base with a fatty substance of animal (tallow) or plant origin (oil). This reaction is called saponification. Syndets, on the other hand, are much more recent and have been in use for about a century. In the case of liquid syndets, they are mainly alkyl sulphates and their derivatives alkyl ether sulphates while isethionates and sarcosinates are more commonly found in solid syndets. Synthetic soaps and detergents are surfactants and, as such, they have detergent properties. The way soap works accounts for its antimicrobial properties. Thanks to its amphiphilic structure, it is able to interact with the lipid membranes of microorganisms (viruses, bacteria, etc.) and inactivate them. In this coronavirus pandemic period, health authorities worldwide recommend hand washing with soap and water. We therefore wanted to provide a summary of the chemical characteristics and applications of soaps, on the one hand, and synthetic detergents, on the other.

The SARS-CoV-2 virus enters the cell via ACE2. ACE2 is a component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) which has an important counterregulatory effect on the classical ACE-dependent pathway. Several antihypertensives increase ACE2 expression or activity, leading to concern that this may facilitate SARS-CoV-2 entry and worsen COVID-19 disease. However, ACE2 is protective against lung injury while ANG II (which is catabolised by ACE2) is associated with lung injury both in mice and humans. We propose that medications which inhibit the RAS ACE-dependent pathway may be beneficial in treating COVID-19 and should be explored in animal models and clinical trials. Here we give an overview of the RAS pathway with respect to COVID-19 and argue that strategies which manipulate this pathway might reduce the destructive lung manifestations of COVID-19 and improve patient outcomes.","Sturrock, Beattie Rh; Milne, Kate; Chevassut, Timothy Jt",Clinical medicine,102,1

CASE We present a patient who developed Bacteroides fragilis sacral osteomyelitis and discitis after laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy with synthetic monofilament mesh and sacral titanium coil fixation. The patient had undergone dental extraction of 3 infected teeth approximately 2 weeks before sacrocolpopexy for stage IV apical vaginal prolapse. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed sacral osteomyelitis and discitis along with Bacteroides fragilis bacteremia approximately a week and a half after the original surgery. The patient was followed up with serial MRIs of the spine which revealed degeneration at the sacral promontory. The patient underwent successful removal of the entire mesh and sacral titanium coils with resolution of her symptoms. Follow-up MRI of the spine revealed resolution of her sacral osteomyelitis.

The role of microvascular dysfunction on MACE beyond traditional risk indicators and inflammation is not well established. We examined whether peripheral microvascular dysfunction is associated with MACE in patients with CAD. Approach and Results: Microvascular function was measured with the Reactive Hyperemia Index (RHI) using digital peripheral arterial tonometry in 546 patients with CAD, who were followed 7 years for incident MACE. The primary end point included cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction; the secondary end point included cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or heart failure hospitalization. Hazard models for competing risk were used to estimate the association between RHI and MACE adjusting for age, sex, race, traditional risk factors, medications, and CAD severity. We also examined the association of baseline interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and matrix metallopeptidase-9 with RHI. Mean age was 62±9 years. Mean RHI was 2.1±0.63. After adjustment, for each 1-SD decrease in RHI, there was a 40% increase in the primary end point (hazard ratio, 1.4 [95% CI, 1.1-1.9], P=0.01) and a similar increase in the secondary end point (HR, 1.3 [95% CI, 1.1-1.7], P=0.006).

We sought to identify existing programs where allied healthcare personnel are the primary providers of the intervention and, to evaluate their effectiveness and safety.MethodsWe systematically searched Medline, CINAHL and EMBASE with terms relating to long-term care, emergency services, hospitalization and allied health personnel. We reviewed 11,176 abstracts and included 22 studies in our narrative synthesis, which we grouped by intervention category.ResultsWe found five categories of interventions including: 1) use of advanced practice nursing; 2) a program called Interventions to Reduce Acute Care Transfers (INTERACT); 3) end-of-life care; 4) condition specific interventions; and 5) use of extended care paramedics. Among studies measuring that outcome, 13/13 reported a decrease in ED visits, and 16/17 reported a decrease hospitalization in the intervention groups. Patient adverse events such as functional status and relapse were seldom reported (6/22) as were measures of emergency system function such as crowding/inability of paramedics to transfer care to the ED (1/22). Only 4/22 studies evaluated patient mortality and 3/4 found a non-statistically significant worsening.ConclusionWe found five types of programs/interventions which all demonstrated a decrease in ED visits or hospitalization. However, most studies were observational and few assessed patient safety. Many identified programs focused on increased primary care for patients, and interventions addressing acute care issues, such as community paramedics, deserve more study.","Leduc, Shannon; Cantor, Zach; Kelly, Peter; Thiruganasambandamoorthy, Venkatesh; Wells, George; Vaillancourt, Christian",Prehospital emergency care : official journal of the National Association of EMS Physicians and the National Association of State EMS Directors,102,5

Objectives: To assess the risk of transmitting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and influenza with administration of drugs via nebulizer. Methods: We searched multiple electronic databases, including PubMed®, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, preprint databases, and clinicaltrials.gov through December 1, 2020. Any study design in any language describing the risk of viral transmission with nebulizer treatment was eligible. Data were abstracted by one investigator and verified by a second. Results: We identified 22 articles: 1 systematic review, 7 cohort/case-control studies, 7 case series, and 7 simulation-based studies. Eight individual studies involved patients with SARS, five involved MERS, and one involved SARS-CoV-2. The seven cohort/case-control studies (four high risk of bias [ROB], three unclear ROB) found mixed results (median odds ratio 3.91, range 0.08-20.67) based on very weak data among a small number of health care workers (HCWs) with variable use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Case series had multiple potential contributors to transmission. Simulation studies found evidence for droplet dispersion after saline nebulization and measureable influenza viral particles up to 1.7 m from the source after 10 minutes of nebulization with a patient simulator. Study heterogeneity prevented meta-analysis. Conclusions: Case series raise concern of transmission risk, and simulation studies demonstrate droplet dispersion with virus recovery, but specific evidence that exposure to nebulizer treatment increases transmission of coronaviruses similar to COVID-19 is inconclusive. Tradeoffs balancing HCW safety and patient appropriateness can potentially minimize risk, including choice of delivery method for inhaled medications (e.g., nebulizer vs. metered dose inhaler) and PPE (e.g., N95 vs. surgical mask).","Goldstein, Karen M; Ghadimi, Kamrouz; Mystakelis, Harry; Kong, Yuanyuan; Meng, Tongtong; Cantrell, Sarah; Von Isenburg, Megan; Gordon, Adelaide; Ear, Belinda; Gierisch, Jennifer M; Williams, John W",Journal of aerosol medicine and pulmonary drug delivery,102,1

However, chronic pain remains a problem with the laparoscopic approach, affecting approximately 10% of patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate clinical outcomes following the use of Parietex ProGrip™ (Covidien, Dublin, Ireland) self-gripping mesh during laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal groin hernia repair. MATERIALS AND METHODS Data were collected prospectively from 145 male and 15 female patients with 235 inguinal hernias. All patients underwent repair by the laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal approach using Parietex ProGrip mesh. During follow-up ranging from 5 to 24 months, complications, pain score, patient satisfaction, and recurrence were analyzed. RESULTS All patients were discharged on the day of surgery or the next morning. There were no immediate complications or returns to the operating room. Delayed postoperative complications included minor bruising to the genital region (3 cases), hematoma/seroma (1 case), and wound infection (1 case). The mean follow-up was 15 months, at which time there were no reports of hernia recurrence and 99% of patients were satisfied with their hernia repair. One patient (0.63%) reported severe pain (numeric rating scale score of >7), and 4 patients (2.5%) reported intermittent mild pain on exertion. CONCLUSIONS The results of this study suggest that the use of a self-gripping mesh during the laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal approach is a promising and effective technique for repairing both primary and recurrent inguinal hernias.","Ozmen, John; Choi, Vincent; Hepburn, Kirsten; Hawkins, Will; Loi, Ken",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

However, there are currently no evidence-based diagnostic rules to identify microbial aetiology in children presenting with acute RTIs. AIM To analyse evidence of associations between clinical symptoms or signs and detection of microbes from the upper respiratory tract (URT) of children with acute cough. DESIGN AND SETTING Systematic review and meta-analysis. METHOD A literature search identified articles reporting relationships between individual symptoms and/or signs, and microbes detected from URT samples. Associations between pathogens and symptoms or signs were summarised, and meta-analysis conducted where possible. RESULTS There were 9984 articles identified, of which 28 met inclusion criteria. Studies identified 30 symptoms and 41 signs for 23 microbes, yielding 1704 potential associations, of which only 226 (13%) have presently been investigated. Of these, relevant statistical analyses were presented for 175 associations, of which 25% were significant. Meta-analysis demonstrated significant relationships between respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) detection and chest retractions (pooled odds ratio [OR] 1.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.6 to 2.3), wheeze (pooled OR 1.7, 95% CI = 1.5 to 2.0), and crepitations/crackles (pooled OR 1.7, 95% CI = 1.3 to 2.2). CONCLUSIONS There was an absence of evidence for URT pathogens other than RSV. The meta-analysis identified clinical signs associated with RSV detection, suggesting clinical presentation may offer some, albeit poor, diagnostic value. Further research is urgently needed to establish the value of symptoms and signs in determining microbiological aetiology and improve targeting of antibiotics in primary care.","Thornton, Hannah V; Blair, Peter S; Lovering, Andrew M; Muir, Peter; Hay, Alastair D",The British journal of general practice : the journal of the Royal College of General Practitioners,102,31

This is a comprehensive meta-analysis of the prevalence of depression in HIV-infected MSM. METHODS Relevant publications were systematically searched in PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Web of Science. Comparative and epidemiological studies with prevalence of depression as measured by the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) were included. The prevalence of depression was pooled using the random-effects model. RESULTS A total of 18 studies with 7653 MSM with HIV and 3395 MSM without HIV were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of depression in MSM living with HIV was 43% (95%CI: 32%-53%). Compared to MSM without HIV, MSM living with HIV were more likely to be depressed (OR = 1.46, 1.05-2.03). Subgroup and meta-regression analyses revealed that different CES-D cut-off values and survey year had significant moderating effects on the prevalence of depression. CONCLUSIONS Depression was common in MSM living with HIV.

Cutaneous sarcoidosis is a rare skin disease and many aspects of the disease presentation and treatment are not well understood. This review will highlight developments in the epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis and treatment of cutaneous sarcoidosis over the past several years. RECENT FINDINGS Epidemiological studies from several different populations reaffirm that cutaneous sarcoidosis is more common in women and is often the presenting symptom of systemic sarcoidosis. Recently, more cases are being reported in association with oncologic immune modulators, which will be of great interest as use of those agents increases. Also, ultrasound has shown promise for the imaging of cutaneous granulomas for disease assessment and measuring response to treatment. Finally, the treatment of cutaneous sarcoidosis remains difficult and is based largely on retrospective data with a paucity of large, prospective trials. There have been recently introduced and validated cutaneous scoring tools which show promise and may lead to more high-quality studies going forward. SUMMARY The recent developments in cutaneous sarcoidosis have identified many new pharmacologic and physical triggers of disease, but the evidence for effective treatment is still lacking. Further research is necessary to improve the care of patients with cutaneous sarcoidosis.","Noe, Megan H; Rosenbach, Misha",Current opinion in pulmonary medicine,102,31

This report describes the initial experience with single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) using the transperitoneal approach for left adrenalectomy. METHODS Between April 2010 and January 2013, all consecutive patients with adrenal masses who agreed to undergo SILS adrenalectomy were included in a prospective study. The left 2.5 cm subcostal incision was the sole point of entry. Data of patients undergoing SILS adrenalectomy were compared with those from an uncontrolled group of patients undergoing conventional laparoscopic adrenalectomy during the same study period. RESULTS There were 40 patients in each study group. SILS was successfully performed and none of the patients required conversion to an open procedure. In 1 case of SILS procedure, an additional lateral 5 mm port was needed for retraction of the kidney. The mean (SD) duration of the operation was 80 (20) minutes in the SILS group and 75 (8) minutes in the conventional laparoscopic adrenalectomy group (P=0.150). No intraoperative or postoperative complications occurred. Differences between the 2 study groups in postoperative pain, number of patients resuming oral intake within the first 24 hours, final pathologic diagnosis (Conn syndrome, Cushing adenomas, nonfunctioning adrenal tumors), and length of hospital stay were not observed. CONCLUSIONS SILS left adrenalectomy is a technically feasible and safe procedure in carefully selected patients and seems to have results similar to a conventional approach in our initial comparison.","Vidal, Oscar; Astudillo, Emiliano; Valentini, Mauro; Ginestá, Cesar; Espert, Juan J; Gracía-Valdecasas, Juan C; Fernández-Cruz, Laureano","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",102,12

The objective of this study was to determine the outcomes of patients treated with bioabsorbable polymer everolimus-eluting (BP-EES; Synergy, Boston Scientific), durable polymer everolimus-eluting (DP-EES; XIENCE, Abbott Vascular), or durable polymer zotarolimus-eluting (DP-ZES; Resolute, Medtronic) stents in routine clinical practice. METHODS All percutaneous coronary intervention cases from 48 hospitals performed after the introduction of the BP-EES stent in 2015 until the first quarter of 2018 were included. Propensity-matched multivariable analysis was used to adjust for differences in baseline characteristics and procedural variables. After matching, we performed pair-wise comparisons between DP-EES and BP-EES, DP-EES and DP-ZES, and BP-EES and DP-ZES for in-hospital postpercutaneous coronary intervention outcomes. We also evaluated 2-year postdischarge mortality in a subset of patients who could be matched to Medicare data. RESULTS During the study period, 53 724 percutaneous coronary intervention cases were performed. A total of 59% of patients were treated with DP-EES stents, 14% with BP-EES stents, and 27% with DP-ZES stents. Although baseline characteristics of patients differed between stent types, these differences were attenuated after matching. In the matched cohort, there was no difference in in-hospital mortality, stent thrombosis, or postprocedural stroke (a falsification end point) between BP-EES, DP-EES, and DP-ZES. After matching, there was no difference in 2-year postdischarge mortality (DP-EES versus BP-EES hazard ratio 0.91, P=0.50; DP-EES versus DP-ZES hazard ratio 1.03, P=0.77; BP-EES versus DP-ZES hazard ratio 1.20, P=0.29). CONCLUSIONS Our data suggest similar risk-adjusted in-hospital outcomes among drug-eluting stent platforms commonly used in clinical practice. The absence of a difference in 2-year mortality between BP-EES, DP-EES, and DP-ZES suggests that stent choice decisions could be made based on other factors, including durability, availability, and cost.","Sutton, Nadia R; Seth, Milan; Madder, Ryan D; Sukul, Devraj; Dixon, Simon R; Cannon, Louis A; Gurm, Hitinder S",Circulation.

Moreover, we presented an overview of the EBPTs mostly used in clinical practice with the aim to modulate immune system dysfunction in sepsis. RECENT FINDINGS Sepsis is a life-threatening disease and recent findings showed that its pathophysiology relies on dysregulated immune system response to pathogen invasion of the body. In the light of this view, EBPTs have been demonstrated effective to remove specific mediators and foster balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory pathways. SUMMARY EBPTs have been widely used in clinical practice, with the aim to modulate immune system dysfunction by the removal of pathogens and inflammatory mediators in critically ill patients with sepsis. Such therapies are characterised by specific structural features, which allow selective and nonselective removal of mediators by adsorption. However, few evidences support their role in the management of critically ill patients with sepsis. Accordingly, an evidence-based and personalized approach to EBPTs in sepsis is strongly advocated, in order to solve controversies in this field and optimise the management of critically ill septic patients.","Cutuli, Salvatore Lucio; Grieco, Domenico Luca; De Pascale, Gennaro; Antonelli, Massimo",Current opinion in anaesthesiology,102,1

This study investigated the mechanisms of penehyclidine hydrochloride (PHC) efficacy on a rat model of primary dysmenorrhea. The model was induced by injecting both estradiol benzoate and oxytocin. Different doses of PHC were administrated intraperitoneally following estradiol benzoate administration. Writhing scores were assessed, and pathological changes of the uterus were observed via hematoxylin and eosin staining. Western blot and real-time PCR were used to evaluate the expression level of the M3 receptor, both TLR3 and TLR4 in uterine tissue, and the level of Ca2+ was measured in uterine tissues. Writhing scores significantly decreased in the PHC treatment group compared to model, and PHC alleviated the occurrence of edema or necrosis in the uteri compared to model group. PHC can decrease the M3 receptor, TLR3 , TLR4 expression, and the Ca2+ level compared to the model group. PHC is a potential candidate for the future treatment of primary dysmenorrhea due to its ability to attenuate muscarinic receptors and TLRs.

Early favorable results led to this confirmatory multi-institutional experience. METHODS Prospectively collected data on consecutive patients undergoing RFT in five North American academic endocrine surgical practices were compiled. Surgical indications, operative times, final pathology, nodule size, complications, and postoperative management (drain use and length of hospital stay) were evaluated. RESULTS A total of 102 RFT procedures were undertaken in 90 patients. All but one of the patients (98.9 %) were female, and the mean age was 41.9 ± 13.1 years (range 12-69 years). The indication for surgery was nodular disease in 91.2 % of cases; 8.8 % were completion procedures performed for a diagnosis of cancer. The mean size of the largest nodule was 1.9 cm (range 0-5.6 cm). The mean total operative time for a thyroid lobectomy was 162 min (range 82-265 min). No permanent complications occurred. There were 4 cases (3.9 %) of transient recurrent laryngeal nerve weakness, no cases of hypocalcemia, and 3 (2.9 %) hematomas. There were no conversions to an anterior cervical approach. The majority of patients were managed on an outpatient basis (61.8 %) and without a drain (65.7 %). CONCLUSIONS RFT is technically feasible and safe in selected patients. RFT can continue to be offered to carefully selected patients as a way to avoid a visible cervical scar. Future prospective studies to compare this novel approach to other remote access approaches are warranted.","Duke, William S; Holsinger, F Christopher; Kandil, Emad; Richmon, Jeremy D; Singer, Michael C; Terris, David J",World journal of surgery,102,7

A multi-prolonged study of polyenes showed that some of them can have not only antifungal, but also antiviral and antitumor action. Fungal pathology develops especially quickly and in this case leads to invasive aspergillosis, which contributes to the complication of coronavirus infection in the lungs and even secondary infection with invasive aspergillosis in the context of a global pandemic. The treatment of an invasive form of bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is directly related to the immunomodulatory and immunostimulating properties of the macrocyclic polyene drug amphotericin B. The article presents experimental data on the study of the biological activity and membrane properties of amphotericin B and the effect of its chemically modified derivatives, as well as liposomal forms of amphotericin B on viral, bacterial and fungal infections. The mechanism of action of amphotericin B and its analogues is based on their interaction with cellular and lipid membranes, by forming ion channels of molecular size in them. The importance of these studies is that polyenes are sensitive to membranes that contain sterols of a certain structure. The analysis showed that pathogenic fungal cells containing ergosterol were 10-100 times more sensitive to polyene antibiotics than host cell membranes containing cholesterol. The high sterol selectivity of the action of polyenes opens up broad prospects for the use of polyene antifungal drugs in practical medicine and pharmacology in the treatment of invasive mycoses and the prevention of atherosclerosis. In this connection, it should be noted that polyene antibiotics are the main tool in the study of the biochemical mechanism of changes in the permeability of cell membranes for energy-dependent substrates. Chemical and genetic engineering transformation of the structure of polyene antibiotic molecules opens up prospects for the identification and creation of new biologically active forms of the antibiotic that have a high selectivity of action in the treatment of pathogenic infections.","Baghirova, A A; Kasumov, Kh M",Biomeditsinskaia khimiia,102,1

The influence of the gastrointestinal microbiome in the setting of maternal obesity during pregnancy is less understood. The purpose of this systematic review is to synthesize the literature on the relationships between maternal obesity and excessive gestational weight gain (EGWG) and the composition of maternal and child gastrointestinal microbiomes. METHOD We searched CINHAL, OVID Medline, Web of Science, and PubMed for relevant literature using medical subject heading terms related to obesity, pregnancy, and the gastrointestinal microbiome. We assessed 249 articles for potential inclusion using the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analyses framework and deemed 11 articles as relevant for this review. RESULTS Maternal obesity was associated with significant microbial changes in both maternal and infant fecal microbiome biospecimens including increases in Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and the Actinobacteria phyla and decreases in Bifidobacteria. However, inconsistencies in uniform taxonomic results across all studies mean that evidence of specific microbial associations with obesity and EGWG is inconclusive. CONCLUSION Our findings suggest that both maternal and child gastrointestinal microbiome composition is altered in the setting of maternal obesity and EGWG during pregnancy. Future microbiome studies should concentrate on the investigation of metagenomic sequencing to elucidate microbial function rather than solely taxonomic composition. More diverse populations of mothers should be sampled to address health disparities and adverse outcomes of underrepresented populations. Finally, analytic pipelines should be standardized across studies to aid in reproducibility.","Dreisbach, Caitlin; Prescott, Stephanie; Alhusen, Jeanne",Biological research for nursing,102,20

Physics- and biology- based models can assist in predicting airborne transmission events, overall disease incidence, and disease control strategy efficacy. We develop a new theory that extends current approaches for the case in which an individual is infected by a single airborne particle, including the scenario in which numerous infectious particles are present in the air but only one causes infection. A single infectious particle can contain more than one pathogenic microorganism and be physically larger than the pathogen itself. This approach allows robust relative risk estimates even when there is wide variation in (a) individual exposures and (b) the individual response to that exposure (the pathogen dose-response function can take any mathematical form and vary by individual). Based on this theory, we propose the Regional Relative Risk - a new metric, distinct from the traditional relative risk metric, that compares the risk between two regions (in theory, these regions can range from individual rooms to large geographic areas). In this paper, we apply the Regional Relative Risk metric to outdoor disease transmission events over spatial scales ranging from 50 m to 20 km demonstrating that in many common cases, minimal input information is required to use the metric. Also, we demonstrate that it is consistent with data from prior outbreaks. Future efforts could apply and validate this theory for other spatial scales, such as indoor environments. This work provides context for (a) the initial stages of an airborne disease outbreak and (b) larger scale disease spread, including unexpected low probability disease ""sparks"" that potentially affect remote populations, a key practical issue in controlling airborne disease outbreaks. Importance Airborne infectious disease transmission events occur over a wide range of spatial scales and can be important to disease outbreaks. We develop a new physics- and biology- based theory for the important case in which individuals are infected by a single airborne particle (numerous infectious particles can be emitted into the air and inhaled). Based on this theory, we propose a new epidemiological metric, Regional Relative Risk, that compares the risk between two geographic regions (in theory, regions can range from individual rooms to large areas). Our modeling of outdoors transmission events predicts that for many scenarios of interest, minimal information is required to use this metric for locations 50 m to 20 km downwind. This prediction is consistent with data from prior disease outbreaks. Future efforts could apply and validate this theory for other spatial scales, such as indoor environments. Our results may a priori be applicable to many airborne diseases as these results depend on the physics of airborne particulate dispersion.","Dillon, Michael B; Dillon, Charles F",Applied and environmental microbiology,102,1

Autoregulation can be monitored in real time with transcranial Doppler (TCD). We have previously demonstrated that near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)-derived regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rS(c)O(2)) provides a clinically suitable surrogate of CBF for autoregulation monitoring. The purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy of a stand-alone ""plug-and-play"" investigational system for autoregulation monitoring that uses a commercially available NIRS monitor with TCD methods. METHODS TCD monitoring of middle cerebral artery CBF velocity and NIRS monitoring were performed in 70 patients during CPB. Indices of autoregulation were computed by both a personal computer-based system and an investigational prototype NIRS-based monitor. A moving linear correlation coefficient between slow waves of ABP and CBF velocity (mean velocity index [Mx]) and between ABP and rS(c)O(2) (cerebral oximetry index [COx]) were calculated. When CBF is autoregulated, there is no correlation between CBF and ABP; when CBF is dysregulated, Mx and COx approach 1 (i.e., CBF and ABP are correlated). Linear regression and bias analysis were performed between time-averaged values of Mx and COx derived from the personal computer-based system and from COx measured with the prototype monitor. Values for Mx and COx were categorized in 5 mm Hg bins of ABP for each patient. The lower limit of CBF autoregulation was defined as the ABP where Mx incrementally increased to ≥0.4. RESULTS There was correlation and good agreement between COx derived from the prototype monitor and Mx (r = 0.510; 95% confidence interval, 0.414-0.595; P < 0.001; bias, -0.07 ± 0.19). The correlation and bias between the personal computer-based COx and the COx from the prototype NIRS monitor were r = 0.957 (95% confidence interval, 0.945-0.966; P < 0.001 and 0.06 ± 0.06, respectively). The average ABP at the lower limit of autoregulation was 63 ± 11 mm Hg (95% prediction interval, 52-74 mm Hg). Although the mean ABP at the COx-determined lower limit of autoregulation determined with the prototype monitor was statistically different from that determined by Mx (59 ± 9 mm Hg; 95% prediction interval, 50-68 mm Hg; P = 0.026), the difference was not likely clinically meaningful. CONCLUSIONS Monitoring CBF autoregulation with an investigational stand-alone NIRS monitor is correlated and in good agreement with TCD-based methods. The availability of such a device would allow widespread autoregulation monitoring as a means of individualizing ABP targets during CPB.","Ono, Masahiro; Zheng, Yueying; Joshi, Brijen; Sigl, Jeffrey C; Hogue, Charles W",Anesthesia and analgesia,102,31

Underlying mechanisms remain largely obscure as they have been related to complex, individual systemic immune properties that are challenging to investigate. In this study, we explored age-related changes in human immunity during a primary virus infection experimentally induced by immunization with live-attenuated yellow fever (YF) vaccine. Applying detailed serology, advanced FACS analysis, and systems biology, we discovered that aged subjects developed fewer neutralizing Abs, mounted diminished YF-specific CD8(+) T cell responses, and showed quantitatively and qualitatively altered YF-specific CD4(+) T cell immunity. Among numerous immune signatures, low in vivo numbers of naive CD4(+) recent thymic emigrants and peripheral dendritic cells correlated well with reduced acute responsiveness and altered long-term persistence of human cellular immunity to YF vaccination. Hence, we reveal in this article that essential elements of immune responses such as recent thymic emigrants and dendritic cells strongly relate to productive immunity in the elderly, providing a conceivable explanation for diminished responsiveness to vaccination with neoantigens and infection with de novo pathogens in the aged population.","Schulz, Axel Ronald; Mälzer, Julia Nora; Domingo, Cristina; Jürchott, Karsten; Grützkau, Andreas; Babel, Nina; Nienen, Mikalai; Jelinek, Tomas; Niedrig, Matthias; Thiel, Andreas",Journal of immunology,102,28

The suggested method was applied to simultaneously recorded subthalamic nucleus (STN) local field potentials (LFP) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) from fourteen Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients who underwent surgery for deep brain stimulation. Recordings were obtained during rest for both OFF and ON dopaminergic medication states. We analyzed the bilateral LFP channels that had the maximum beta power in the OFF state and the cortical sources that had the maximum coherence with the selected LFP channels in the alpha band. Our findings revealed the inherent nonlinearity in the PD data as subcortical high beta (20 - 30 Hz) band and cortical alpha (8 - 12 Hz) band activities. While the former was discernible without medication (p=0.015), the latter was induced upon the dopaminergic medication (p<6.10-4). The degree of subthalamic nonlinearity was correlated with contralateral tremor severity (r=0.45, p=0.02). Conversely, for the cortical signals nonlinearity was present for the ON medication state with a peak in the alpha band and correlated with contralateral akinesia and rigidity (r=0.46, p=0.02). This correlation appeared to be independent from that of alpha power and the two measures combined explained 34 % of the variance in contralateral akinesia scores. Our findings suggest that particular frequency bands and brain regions display nonlinear features closely associated with distinct motor symptoms and functions.","Özkurt, Tolga Esat; Akram, Harith; Zrinzo, Ludvic; Limousin, Patricia; Foltynie, Tom; Oswal, Ashwini; Litvak, Vladimir",NeuroImage,102,7

We assessed functional outcome in ischaemic stroke patients with large vessel anterior circulation occlusion undergoing endovascular thrombectomy under GA, versus thrombectomy not under GA (with or without sedation) versus standard care (ie, no thrombectomy), stratified by the use of GA versus standard care. METHODS For this meta-analysis, patient-level data were pooled from all patients included in randomised trials in PuMed published between Jan 1, 2010, and May 31, 2017, that compared endovascular thrombectomy predominantly done with stent retrievers with standard care in anterior circulation ischaemic stroke patients (HERMES Collaboration). The primary outcome was functional outcome assessed by ordinal analysis of the modified Rankin scale (mRS) at 90 days in the GA and non-GA subgroups of patients treated with endovascular therapy versus those patients treated with standard care, adjusted for baseline prognostic variables. To account for between-trial variance we used mixed-effects modelling with a random effect for trials incorporated in all models. Bias was assessed using the Cochrane method. The meta-analysis was prospectively designed, but not registered. FINDINGS Seven trials were identified by our search; of 1764 patients included in these trials, 871 were allocated to endovascular thrombectomy and 893 were assigned standard care. After exclusion of 74 patients (72 did not undergo the procedure and two had missing data on anaesthetic strategy), 236 (30%) of 797 patients who had endovascular procedures were treated under GA. At baseline, patients receiving GA were younger and had a shorter delay between stroke onset and randomisation but they had similar pre-treatment clinical severity compared with patients who did not have GA. Endovascular thrombectomy improved functional outcome at 3 months both in patients who had GA (adjusted common odds ratio (cOR) 1·52, 95% CI 1·09-2·11, p=0·014) and in those who did not have GA (adjusted cOR 2·33, 95% CI 1·75-3·10, p<0·0001) versus standard care. However, outcomes were significantly better for patients who did not receive GA versus those who received GA (covariate-adjusted cOR 1·53, 95% CI 1·14-2·04, p=0·0044). The risk of bias and variability between studies was assessed to be low. INTERPRETATION Worse outcomes after endovascular thrombectomy were associated with GA, after adjustment for baseline prognostic variables. These data support avoidance of GA whenever possible. The procedure did, however, remain effective versus standard care in patients treated under GA, indicating that treatment should not be withheld in those who require anaesthesia for medical reasons.

In times of an acute crisis, however, close friends might not be available, and physical closeness might be impossible. This functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study investigated the effect of social proximity on the effectiveness of social support for regulating emotions and the underlying neural mechanisms. Participants regulated their emotions in response to negative images either alone (intrapersonal regulation), or with help of a picture and supporting sentence provided by the best friend, or by a stranger (interpersonal regulation). Regulation success was enhanced for the support of friends compared to regulating alone or with the support of strangers. This effect was accompanied by the interplay of large-scale brain networks involved in processing emotions, social cognition, and cognitive control. Interpersonal regulation appeared to be implemented by lateral prefrontal regions. The amygdala showed increased activation for strangers. The activation profile of the social cognition network suggests a role in supporting empathic and mentalizing processes.

We analyze the implications of integrating health and climate when determining the best locations for replacing power plants with new wind, solar, or natural gas to meet a CO2 reduction target in the United States. We employ a capacity expansion model with integrated assessment of climate and health damages, comparing portfolios optimized for benefits to climate alone or both health and climate. The model estimates county-level health damages and accounts for uncertainty by using a range of air quality models (AP3, EASIUR, and InMAP) and concentration-response functions (American Cancer Society and Harvard Six Cities). We find that reducing CO2 by 30% yields $21-68 billion in annual health benefits, with an additional $9-36 billion possible when co-optimizing for climate and health benefits. Additional benefits accrue from prioritizing emissions reductions in counties with high population exposure. Total health benefits equal or exceed climate benefits across a wide range of modeling assumptions. Our results demonstrate the value of considering health in climate policy design and the need for interstate cooperation to achieve additional health benefits equitably.","Sergi, Brian; Adams, Peter J; Muller, Nicholas; Robinson, Allen L; Davis, Steven; Marshall, Julian D; Azevedo, Ines M Lima",Environmental science & technology,102,31

METHODS Multicenter, retrospective, comparative study of perioperative results from open and robotic IHR using standard univariate and multivariate regression analyses for propensity score matched (1:1) cohorts. RESULTS Seven general surgeons at six institutions contributed 602 consecutive open IHR and 652 consecutive R-TAPP IHR cases. Baseline patient characteristics in the unmatched groups were similar with the exception of previous abdominal surgery and all baseline characteristics were comparable in the matched cohorts. In matched analyses, postoperative complications prior to discharge were comparable. However, from post discharge through 30 days, fewer patients experienced complications in the R-TAPP group than in the open group [4.3% vs 7.7% (p = 0.047)]. The R-TAPP group had no reoperations post discharge through 30 days of follow-up compared with five patients (1.1%) in the open group (p = 0.062), respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis which demonstrated patient age > 65 years and the open approach were risk factors for complications within 30 days post discharge in the matched group [age > 65 years: odds ratio (OR) = 3.33 (95% CI 1.89, 5.87; p < 0.0001); open approach: OR = 1.89 (95% CI 1.05, 3.38; p = 0.031)]. CONCLUSIONS In this matched analysis, R-TAPP provides similar postoperative complications prior to discharge and a lower rate of postoperative complications through 30 days compared to open repair. R-TAPP is a promising and reproducible approach, and may facilitate adoption of minimally invasive repairs of inguinal hernias.","Gamagami, R; Dickens, E; Gonzalez, A; D'Amico, L; Richardson, C; Rabaza, J; Kolachalam, R",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,102,1

Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with specific light wavelengths could be used as an energy source for algal growth and lipid synthesis. In this study, the effects of light source on the biomass and lipid production of the aerial microalga Coccomyxa sp. KGU-D001 were evaluated using LEDs. The integration of two-phase cultures, including growth and lipid production under the stress of nitrate depletion, was assessed for efficient lipid production under liquid- or aerial-phase conditions. Different wavelengths of light (blue, green, and red) were tested under liquid- and aerial-phase conditions. Under aerial-phase culture, the fatty acid contents in biofilm reached 320 mg g DWC-1 with the red LEDs. In view of these findings, we describe a one-step culture method for growth and lipid accumulation in algal biofilm under aerial-phase culture with red LED irradiation. When Coccomyxa biofilm was cultured on wet cotton wool with BBM in a petri dish under the red LED, it was able to grow and accumulate lipids under the aerial-phase condition.

Options for endovascular surgeons and interventionists who treat occlusive carotid disease continue to expand. We here present an update and overview of carotid stenting devices. Evidence supporting carotid stenting includes randomized controlled trials that compare endovascular stenting to open surgical endarterectomy. Carotid technologies addressed include the carotid stents themselves as well as adjunct neuroprotective devices. Aspects of stent technology include bare-metal versus covered stents, stent tapering, and free-cell area. Drug-eluting and cutting balloon indications are described. Embolization protection options and new direct carotid access strategies are reviewed. Adjunct technologies, such as intravascular ultrasound imaging and risk stratification algorithms, are discussed. Bare-metal and covered stents provide unique advantages and disadvantages. Stent tapering may allow for a more fitted contour to the caliber decrement between the common carotid and internal carotid arteries but also introduces new technical challenges. Studies regarding free-cell area are conflicting with respect to benefits and associated risk; clinical relevance of associated adverse effects associated with either type is unclear. Embolization protection strategies include distal filter protection and flow reversal. Though flow reversal was initially met with some skepticism, it has gained wider acceptance and may provide the advantage of not crossing the carotid lesion before protection is established. New direct carotid access techniques address difficult anatomy and incorporate sophisticated flow-reversal embolization protection techniques. Carotid stenting is a new and exciting field with rapidly advancing technologies. Embolization protection, low-risk deployment, and lesion assessment and stratification are active areas of research. Ample room remains for further innovations and developments.","Morr, Simon; Lin, Ning; Siddiqui, Adnan H",Medical devices,102,28

MATERIALS AND METHODS Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt and DIPS procedures performed for variceal hemorrhage between January 2008 and July 2014 were reviewed. The default procedure was TIPS creation, with DIPS creation reserved for patients with unfavorable anatomy or who had technically unsuccessful TIPS creation. Thirteen patients underwent DIPS creation (mean age, 60 y ± 12; Child-Pugh class A/B/C, 8%/62%/30%; Model for End-stage Liver Disease score, 15 ± 5; range, 8-26) and 117 underwent TIPS creation. Four patients underwent a TIPS attempt and were converted to DIPS creation upon technical failure; 9 were treated primarily with DIPS creation because of preprocedural imaging revealing unfavorable anatomy (intrahepatic portal thrombosis, n = 2; venous distortion from prior hepatic resections, n = 2; severely angulated hepatic veins, n = 5). RESULTS Direct intrahepatic portocaval shunt creation with variceal embolization (six gastric or esophageal; seven stomal, duodenal, or rectal) was successful in all patients; 11 also had concomitant variceal sclerotherapy. Mean DIPS procedure time was less than 2 hours. There was 1 major procedural complication. During a mean follow-up of 13.0 months ± 15.5, 1 patient developed DIPS thrombosis and recurrent hemorrhage; 1 patient underwent successful transplantation. Two deaths were observed within 30 days, neither associated with recurrent hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS Direct intrahepatic portocaval shunt creation appears to be a safe, expedient, and effective treatment for patients with acute variceal hemorrhage who are poor anatomic candidates for TIPS creation or who have undergone unsuccessful TIPS creation attempts.","Ward, Thomas J; Techasith, Tust; Louie, John D; Hwang, Gloria L; Hofmann, Lawrence V; Sze, Daniel Y",Journal of vascular and interventional radiology : JVIR,102,1

The mechanisms that underlie this phenomenon have nonetheless remained unclear. Methods Biochemical and functional properties of naive CD8+ T cells were characterized and compared between middle aged and older individuals. Findings We identified an age-related link between altered basal lipid metabolism in naive CD8+ T cells and their impaired responsiveness to stimulation, characterized by low proliferative potential and susceptibility to apoptosis. Reversal of the bioenergetic anomalies with lipid-altering drugs, such as rosiglitazone, improved the functional capabilities of naive CD8+ T cells in elderly subjects. Interpretation Interventions that favor lipid catabolism may find utility as adjunctive therapies in the elderly to promote vaccine-induced immunity against emerging pathogens or tumors. Funding A full list of the funding sources is detailed in the Acknowledgment section of the manuscript. RESEARCH IN CONTEXT Evidence before this study Old subjects are highly susceptible to infections and tumors and usually present with low responses to vaccine. This is mainly due to the age-related loss of primary immune resources, i.e. a quantitative decline of naive CD8+ T cells. Nonetheless, few studies have also underlined, within this cell subset, qualitative defects in elderly subjects. Added value of this study Considering the well-demonstrated link between nutrient usage and lymphocyte functions, we characterized the bioenergetics features of old naïve CD8+ T cells. Our data show an age-dependent altered basal metabolism in this cell subset, mostly at the levels of fatty acids and mitochondrial functions. These alterations were associated with functional defects which were partially reverted through the use of lipid-lowering strategies. Implications of all the available evidence This study highlights the potential role of an altered cellular lipid metabolism in immunosenescence, providing clues to understand the epidemiological profile of emerging infections or tumors and to develop preventive and therapeutic strategies based on metabolic manipulation.","Nicoli, Francesco; Cabral-Piccin, Mariela P.; Papagno, Laura; Gallerani, Eleonora; Folcher, Victor; Dubois, Marion; Clave, Emmanuel; Vallet, Hélène; Frere, Justin J.; Gostick, Emma; Llewellyn-Lacey, Sian; Price, David A.; Toubert, Antoine; Boddaert, Jacques; Caputo, Antonella; Gavioli, Riccardo; Appay, Victor",bioRxiv,102,1

Semi-structured in-depth interviews and participant observation were used to examine participants’ racialized experiences. The findings indicate that Western dating apps, such as Tinder, Bumble, and HER, served as crucial channels of these women’s interracial and intercultural encounters while living in Australia. However, they largely perceived these apps, and HER in particular, as White-dominated and ill-suited to their dating practices, thus reinforcing their sense of exclusion and ostracism. Although the participants frequently encountered subtle prejudice on dating apps, they experienced more blatant and aggressive forms of racism triggered by the COVID-19 outbreak. Multiple factors, including their language capability, the COVID-19 pandemic, and their racial, ethnic, and diasporic identities, played an intersectional role in these women’s racialized experiences.

Its importance is recognised increasingly in the global COVID-19 pandemic to help free up inpatient beds. Methods We initially evaluated the time involved in providing an ambulatory heart failure service compared to an inpatient admission for decompensation of heart failure. The NHS Test Bed project is a method of providing access to ambulatory services for heart failure patients and we evaluated the impact of this on admissions, focusing on Emergency Department presentations and emergency inpatient admissions. Results We have demonstrated that an ambulatory heart failure service leads to a reduction in time caring for each patient by 4 hours and 6 minutes compared to an inpatient admission (tables 1 & 2). Our NHS Test Bed study was conducted over a two-year timeframe (inclusive of the introduction of the Combined Application System Innovation (CASI) tool to access ambulatory care services in April 2019) shows a promising linear trend with a step-by-step reduction in Emergency Department presentations for heart failure patients every month (figure 1). However, this was not statistically significant as a greater reduction was seen in the control group who did not have access to this service. The largest study of 1600 heart failure patients used telephone-based heart failure monitoring.3 This showed no reduction in mortality or hospitalisations attributed to this monitoring strategy, but this was attributed to poor adherence with only 55% of patients taking part by the six-month timepoint. The deficit in our study and others in demonstrating a real-world benefit could be attributed to small numbers of patients and short timeframes to evaluate impact. The results also help convey an important safety aspect of using the CASI tool showing a 1.9-fold (95% CI: 1.25 - 2.89;p-value=0.007) increase in the number of emergency admissions for heart failure compared to prior to induction of CASI in the registered users (figure 2). This demonstrates an important triage system embedded in the NHS test bed work in being able to not just send patients to ambulatory care but also filter out patients that need more urgent review. Conclusion It is important to appreciate the importance of an ambulatory heart failure service in freeing up NHS beds. Evaluating the NHS Test Bed project over a longer timeframe with large numbers of patients to reach statistical significance will be of vital importance to prepare for the future surges of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ananthan, K.; Khan, S.",Heart,102,1

As such, public health officials and professionals have sought data regarding the effect of Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) features to control and mitigate viruses, particularly coronaviruses. A systematic review was conducted using international standards to identify and comprehensively synthesize research examining the effectiveness of ventilation for mitigating transmission of coronaviruses. The results from 32 relevant studies showed that: increased ventilation rate was associated with decreased transmission, transmission probability/risk, infection probability/risk, droplet persistence, virus concentration, and increased virus removal and virus particle removal efficiency; increased ventilation rate decreased risk at longer exposure times; some ventilation was better than no ventilation; airflow patterns affected transmission; ventilation feature (e.g., supply/exhaust, fans) placement influenced particle distribution. Some studies provided qualitative recommendations; however, few provided specific quantitative ventilation parameters suggesting a significant gap in current research. Adapting HVAC ventilation systems to mitigate virus transmission is not a one-solution-fits-all approach but instead requires consideration of factors such as ventilation rate, airflow patterns, air balancing, occupancy, and feature placement.","Thornton, G.

Today, millions of people are online gig workers, selling goods and services or renting rooms, houses, and other assets by using platforms such as Uber, Lyft, Rover, DoorDash, eBay, Etsy, VRBO, and Airbnb to connect with customers. Millions more people are defined as offline gig workers: They do not use an online platform to connect with customers but do continue to run errands;walk dogs;rent rooms;care for children and the elderly;sell goods at outdoor markets and roadside stands;and perform housework, yardwork, and other occasional jobs. This article focuses on gig workers-and especially women gig workers-who engage in online or offline gig work as a supplemental source of income rather than as a primary or sole source of their income (i.e., GigSupp workers). In particular, this article answers the following research questions: (1) what do existing measures of GigSupp work show about its growth and whether any data gaps remain;(2) what are the challenges and anticipated needs of GigSupp workers in saving for retirement (including the extraordinary circumstances presented by the COVID-19 pandemic);and (3) what are the specific federal tax, retirement, and financial literacy policy proposals that might help GigSupp workers better finance their retirement?. © 2021 STAIN Kudus.

Such global emergency cases reacquaint us with the fact that education cannot be taken for granted, making the findings of the current research literature inevitable and ready for immediate use for future policy-making regarding online education. Thus, we planned to conduct the present research synthesis including more recent empirical studies of both a quantitative and qualitative character. We took a multi-complementary approach including a meta-analysis together with a meta-thematic analysis of the effectiveness of online education. In order to further complement and consolidate the results of these two reviews of previous studies, we conducted a mixed-methods research (a pre-experimental study and a qualitative study) designed specifically to understand the responses from the abrupt transition period of online education. This kind of research approach is believed to make more contributions to the relevant literature as it may provide a more in-depth perusal of the impacts of online learning on and its effectiveness in student achievement.

Therefore, restaurants have begun to provide local food, which is reflected in “farm to fork” or “locally-sourced” or “farm to table” restaurants. Thus, purchasing sustainable food, specifically local food products, has become one of the most salient sustainability practices in restaurants. Therefore, this study seeks to further explore the influences of the Sustainable Local Food Supply Chain (SLFSC) of green fine-dining restaurants on tourist food experiences and destination branding in the USA. Data were analyzed using the partial least square (PLS) technique of a sample of 232 respondents. The findings of this study showed positive impacts of all sustainability dimensions on most consumption values of tourists (i.e., emotional, epistemic, health, taste/quality, etc.). The findings indicated that each sustainability dimension and overall sustainability of the local food supply chain had strong positive effects on destination branding. Finally, tourist food experiences in totality mediated the relationship between the overall Sustainable Local Food Supply Chain and destination branding. This study contributes to the existing literature by developing and validating a scale to measure the sustainability practices of local food supply chains in restaurants to fill this gap in the literature. Additionally, the findings have intimate important theoretical and practical implications.","Alsetoohy, Omar Ayoun Baker Abou-Kamar Mahmoud",Sustainability,102,1

Furthermore, we assess Mongolia’s external debt sustainability under the COVID−19 pandemic shock. Under our assumed pandemic scenario, Mongolia’s external debt will increase by 30% from its steady state over the next 10–28 quarters.

The TDC will be a part of the readout ASIC, called ETROC, to read out Low-Gain Avalanche Detectors (LGADs) for the CMS Endcap Timing Layer (ETL) of High-Luminosity LHC upgrade. One of the challenges of the ETROC design is that the TDC is required to consume less than 200 W for each pixel at the nominal hit occupancy of 1%. To meet the low-power requirement, we use a single delay line for both the Time of Arrival (TOA) and the Time over Threshold (TOT) measurements without delay control. A double-strobe self-calibration scheme is used to compensate for process variation, temperature, and power supply voltage. The TDC is fabricated in a 65 nm CMOS technology. The overall performances of the TDC have been evaluated. The TOA has a bin size of 17.8 ps within its effective dynamic range of 11.6 ns. The effective measurement precision of the TOA is 5.6 ps and 9.9 ps with and without the nonlinearity correction, respectively. The TDC block consumes 97 W at the hit occupancy of 1%. Over a temperature range from 23 C to 78 C and a power supply voltage range from 1.05 V to 1.35 V (the nominal value of 1.20 V), the self-calibrated bin size of the TOA varies within 0.4%.

Research in the area continues to grow, with a greater focus on reliable measurement, evidence-based interventions and sensitive outcomes. The relationship between missed care and adverse patient outcomes is undeniable, including increased mortality levels, and hospital acquired infections. The link between hospital acquired infections and non-compliance with infection prevention and control guidelines is also widely acknowledged. The idea of non-compliance as an element of missed nursing care has not been closely examined and this relationship is explored in this review. Objectives The aim of this study is to identify the shared factors related to both nurse non-compliance with infection prevention and control practices and the recognised research field of missed nursing care, here in relation to infection prevention and control. Methods A scoping review methodology was selected to help explore and map the research evidence on non-compliance with infection prevention and control practices and missed nursing care in relation to infection prevention and control. Results Five key themes were identified which impact on both missed nursing care and non-compliance in the area of infection prevention and control. These included (1) Organisation of nursing staff and resources;(2) Workplace Environment;(3) Nursing Care Context;(4) Managerial and Inter- Professional Relationships;and (5) Individual Nurse Factors. These shared themes underline the relationship between the concepts and suggest a shared research area. Conclusion Missed nursing care in the area of infection prevention and control overlaps significantly with the research area of infection prevention and control non-compliance. This suggests that rather than being approached as separate or distinct entities, these research areas should be acknowledged as related or overlapping, enabling more focused attention to reducing levels of both. Tweetable abstract Missed nursing care in the area of infection control, overlaps significantly with the research area of non-compliance with infection prevention and control guidelines. Contribution of the Paper What is already known about the topic? • Missed nursing care has been linked over many years with increased rates of Healthcare Associated Infection rates. • Healthcare Associated Infections can result in higher rates of morbidity and mortality, but they are largely preventable. • Infection prevention and control guidelines are designed to protect both patients and healthcare workers from infection in healthcare settings, but non-compliance with these guidelines is an on-going concern. What this paper adds? • Factors influencing missed nursing care in general, and specifically missed infection prevention and control care, are similar to factors influencing non-compliance rates with infection prevention and control guidelines. • The concepts of missed nursing care in infection prevention and control, and non-compliance with infection prevention and control guidelines are essentially the same thing and should be treated as such by nurses, researchers, and healthcare organisations. This would enable a more focused and strategic response to infection prevention and control practices, ultimately helping to reduce preventable healthcare associated infections.","McCauley, Lauren Kirwan Marcia Matthews Anne",International Journal of Nursing Studies Advances,102,1

The decision of the ANSM comprised obvious political aspects, as baclofen approval followed a decade-long practice of off-label prescription, where doses used could reach 300 mg per day or more. This situation led to a prolonged and ferocious debate between those who questioned such a widespread and unevidenced practice, and those who defended the place of an “common sense” empirical medicine. The French story of baclofen echoes other similar controversial off-label prescribing practices in the country, from the pioneer use buprenorphine for opioid use disorder in the 1990s, to the more recent off-label use of hydroxychloroquine during the COVID-19 outbreak. In each case, similar “pros” and “cons” arguments were opposed, highlighting the difficult interpenetration between evidence-based medicine on the one hand, and on-the-ground practice on the other hand.DisclosureBenjamin Rolland declare having received fees for lectures and expertise from Ethypharm.

It has been proposed that the most iconic Antarctic animal, the penguin, experiences low pathogen pressure, accounting for their disease susceptibility in foreign environments. However, there is a limited understanding of virome diversity in Antarctic species, the extent of in situ virus evolution, or how it relates to that in other geographic regions. To test the idea that penguins have limited microbial diversity we determined the viromes of three species of penguins and their ticks sampled on the Antarctic peninsula. Using total RNA-Sequencing we identified 107 viral species, comprising likely penguin associated viruses (n = 13), penguin diet and microbiome associated viruses (n = 82) and tick viruses (n = 8), two of which may have the potential to infect penguins. Notably, the level of virome diversity revealed in penguins is comparable to that seen in Australian waterbirds, including many of the same viral families. These data therefore reject the theory that penguins are subject to lower pathogen pressure. The repeated detection of specific viruses in Antarctic penguins also suggests that rather than being simply spill-over hosts, these animals may act as key virus reservoirs.","Wille, Michelle; Harvey, Erin; Shi, Mang; Gonzalez-Acuña, Daniel; Holmes, Edward C.; Hurt, Aeron C.",bioRxiv,102,1

Despite the impact of social expectations on toilet usage, few programs and studies have developed theoretically grounded norms-centric behavior change interventions to increase toilet use in low-income settings. This protocol details the rationale and design of an ex-ante, parallel cluster-randomized trial evaluating the impact of a demand-side, norms-centric behavior change intervention on exclusive toilet use and maintenance in peri-urban Tamil Nadu, India. Methods and Analysis: Following two years of formative research, we developed an evidence-based norm-centric behavior change intervention called Nam Nalavazhvu (Tamil for 'Our wellbeing'). The multi-level intervention aims to shift collective beliefs by shifting empirical expectations or beliefs about other relevant people's sanitation practices. It also provides action-oriented information to aid individuals to set goals and overcome barriers to build, consistently use and maintain their toilets. This trial includes 76 wards in Pudukkottai and Karur districts, where half were randomly assigned to receive the intervention and the remaining serve as counterfactuals. During baseline and endline (conducted one year after the initiation of intervention) assessments, we collect relevant data and compare results between study arms to determine the impacts of the Nam Nalavazhvu intervention on sanitation-related behavioral, health, wellbeing outcomes and potential moderators. This study is powered to detect differences in the prevalence of exclusive toilet use between study arms. We will also conduct a process evaluation to understand the extent to which the intervention was implemented, as designed.","Ashraf, S.; Bicchieri, C.; Delea, M.

Two linked methods are considered. The first, termed the gradualist approach, assumes that the R-rate is controlled to a value close to 1.0 and that the social distancing index (SDI), which measures the nation’s level of interpersonal contact, is allowed to increase continuously to the point where it can grow no further and society and the economy are fully open. The second method, termed the two-step strategy, adopts the gradualist approach initially, but then, after a certain time, the SDI is stepped to its maximum value, which implies the immediate removal of all restrictions. It is found that, while vaccination-generated immunity makes a very valuable contribution to overall immunity, the other components—prior T-cell immunity and immunity generated by infection—are just as important. Infection-generated immunity needs to be the largest component if all restrictions are to be removed, under both strategies. Leaving lockdown to the point where all restrictions can be fully eased requires a narrow path to be followed during the spring and early summer of 2021, keeping the R-rate in a central band around 1.0. Close control of the R-rate is needed and this will require it to be measured accurately, continuously and rapidly. The gradualist approach might allow all restrictions to be lifted by the end of the summer 2021, while the two-step strategy might offer the prospect of full derestriction by the end of May 2021. © 2021 Collegium Basilea.","Thomas, P.",Nanotechnology Perceptions,102,1

Amidst circulation of the highly infectious Delta variant, there is danger that without the appropriate safety precautions, substantial amount of school-based spread of COVID-19 may occur. Methods: We used an extended Susceptible-Infected-Recovered computational model to estimate the number of new infections during 1 semester among a student population under different assumptions about mask usage, routine testing, and levels of incoming protection. Our analysis considers three levels of incoming protection (30%, 40%, or 50%; denoted as ""low"", ""mid"", or ""high""). Universal mask usage decreases infectivity by 50%, and weekly testing may occur among 50% of the student population; positive tests prompt quarantine until recovery, with compliance contingent on symptom status. Results: Without masking and testing, more than 75% of susceptible students become get infected within three months in all settings. With masking, this values decreases to 50% for ""low"" incoming protection settings (""mid""=35%, ""high""=24%). Testing half the masked population (""testing"") further drops infections to 22% (16%, 13%). Conclusion: Without interventions in place, the vast majority of susceptible students will become infected through the semester. Universal masking can reduce student infections by 26-78%, and biweekly testing along with masking reduces infections by another 50%. To prevent new infections in the community, limit school absences, and maintain in-person learning, interventions such as masking and testing must be implemented widely, especially among elementary school settings in which children are not yet eligible for the vaccine.","Zhang, Y.; Johnson, K.; Hassmiller Lich, K.; Ivy, J.; Keskinocak, P.; Mayorga, M.; Swann, J.

The purpose of this study, therefore, is to determine the key dimensions of memorable tourism experiences (MTEs) that influence tourists' satisfaction with the vacation experience motivated by the beauty of nature and landscape, as well as the impact of satisfaction with vacation experience on behavioural intentions. Design - Using a structured questionnaire on pencil and paper, data were collected from a sample of 334 travellers who were citizens of the Republic of Croatia and whose primary motive for travel was to visit a natural attraction. Methodology/approach - The questionnaire adopted previously validated scales and was used to explore MTEs, satisfaction with the vacation experience and behavioural intentions. The hypotheses were empirically tested using partial least square structural equation modelling. Findings - The results show that not all MTE dimensions influence satisfaction with the vacation experience among tourists whose primary travel motive was the beauty of nature and landscape. Hedonism, refreshment, and involvement as MTE dimensions had a statistically significant influence on satisfaction with the vacation experience. In addition, satisfaction with the vacation experience had a statistically significant influence on several behavioural intentions, with the strongest influence on intention to recommend. Originality of the research - Tourists in nature-based destinations were found to exhibit specific behaviours, as not all MTE dimensions contribute equally to satisfaction with the vacation experience.

The data also underscores the growing importance of the role of external stakeholders including regulators and the general public in setting priorities as we match the capabilities of an increasingly responsive grid to an increasingly dynamic risk environment. While there are key differences between the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on utility operations and the grid versus the typical impact of weather-related events, a grid that is more resilient to weather-related events also provides resilience during a pandemic. The timeline to a post-pandemic normal is still unknown, but utilities can leverage the economic recovery that will follow the current economic recession to build a more resilient and sustainable grid with the support of analytic tools, models and metrics that enable dynamic grid operations and investment that address immediate and longer term risks. © 2021 IEEE.","Aguilar, S.; Kushner, D.; Ortega, J.; Paaso, A.; Ratner, J.; Schlegelmilch, J.","8th IEEE Conference on Technologies for Sustainability, SusTech 2021",102,1

Mutated DNA was transfected into B lymphoma cells that were then selected by neomycin resistance and for their ability to express I-Ak molecules on their plasma membrane. The translational diffusion coefficient (Dlat) of I-Ak molecules composed of a wild-type beta chain paired with an alpha chain missing either 6 or 12 amino acids from the cytoplasmic domain is on the average threefold higher than the Dlat of wild-type I-Ak molecules as measured by fluorescence photobleaching and recovery. The removal of 12 amino acids from the cytoplasmic domain of the beta chain did not change the Dlat value from that of wild-type I-Ak if the truncated beta chain was paired with a wild-type alpha chain. Removing all amino acids of the cytoplasmic domains of both the alpha and beta chains resulted in a 10-fold increase in the Dlat, the highest value for any of the truncated I-Ak molecules tested. These data indicate that the carboxy- terminal six amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain of the alpha chain and the six plasma membrane-proximal amino acids of the beta chain are important in constraining the translational diffusion of I-Ak molecules in the plasma membrane.",,J Cell Biol,102,12

To check appropriateness of the antigen based testing, we determined sensitivity of two point-of-care antigen tests when applied to a cohort of COVID-19 symptomatic, COVID-19 asymptomatic and healthy persons. METHODS We examined nasopharyngeal swabs with antigen test 1 (Panbio Covid-19 Ag Rapid Test, Abbott) and antigen test 2 (Standard F Covid-19 Ag FIA, SD Biosensor). An additional nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab of the same individual was checked with PCR (Allplex SARS-nCoV-2, Seegene). Within a 4-day period in October 2020, we collected specimens from 591 subjects. Of them, 290 had COVID-19 associated symptoms. RESULTS While PCR positivity was detected in 223 cases, antigen test 1 and antigen test 2 were found positive in 148 (sensitivity 0.664, 95%CI 0.599, 0.722) and 141 (sensitivity 0.623, 95%CI 0.558, 0.684) patients, respectively. When only symptomatic patients were analysed, sensitivity increased to 0.738 (95%CI 0.667, 0.799) for the antigen test 1 and to 0.685 (95%CI 0.611, 0.750) for the antigen test 2. The substantial drop in sensitivity to 12.9% (95%CI 0.067, 0.234) was observed for samples with the PCR threshold cycle above > 30. CONCLUSIONS Low sensitivity of antigen tests leads to the considerable risk of false negativity. It is advisable to implement repeated testing with high enough frequency if the antigen test is used as a frontline screening tool, and to follow with PCR if it is applied to vulnerable populations.","Dřevínek, P; Hurych, J; Kepka, Z; Briksi, A; Kulich, M; Zajac, M; Hubáček, P","Epidemiologie, mikrobiologie, imunologie : casopis Spolecnosti pro epidemiologii a mikrobiologii Ceske lekarske spolecnosti J.E.

PRCV multiplies mainly in tonsilar tissues and the respiratory tract. There are no enteric symptoms and in experimentally infected pigs, even the respiratory tract infection is usually asymptomatic. PRCV is spread aerogenically through herds and the significance of PRCV as a pathogen in swine has yet to be determined. Despite the differences in pathogenesis and tissue tropism, the behavior of TGEV and PRCV are closely related antigenically. PRCV induces an antibody response in pigs that cannot be distinguished from TGEV-infected pigs by conventional serological assays. PRCV sensitized animals are not protected from TGEV challenge nor is the milk antibody provided to nursing piglets completely effective in prevention of TGEV infections; thus PRCV is not a good vaccine candidate for TGEV infections. PRCV subclinical infections have led to several reported cases of enzootic TGEV in herds that had been diagnosed as TGEV immune strictly on the basis of serum neutralizing titers which were later found to be due to exposure to PRCV. Vaccination studies conducted with the Ambico, oral modified live TGEV vaccine have led to some startling new results: (1) Use of Ambico TGEV modified live vaccine has been shown to provide complete protection against subsequent PRCV challenge and (2) the effectiveness of TGEV vaccination is actually enhanced by previous exposure to PRCV (3) Weanling pigs which have passively acquired circulating TGEV neutralizing antibodies are protected from subsequent PRCV infections.","Welter, M W; Horstman, M P; Welter, C J; Welter, L M",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,102,28

METHODS The clinical data of 94 SARS cases treated during the outbreak of SARS in South China in 2003 were collected for a retrospective review. According to different treatment regimens, the patients were divided into hormone group (n=35) and non-hormone group (n=59). The control groups consisted of 65 patients with interstitial pneumonia, 78 with bacterial pneumonia and 57 with upper respiratory tract infection. The changes in body temperature were compared between the SARS patients and those with other respiratory diseases and the effect of glucocorticoid hormone on controlling body temperature of the SARS patients was explored. RESULTS The body temperature of patients with the 4 diseases all exhibited obvious reduction 7 days after hospitalization (P<0.001) with only subsequent mild fluctuation within the basically normal range. At each time point of measurement, the body temperature of SARS patients was significantly higher than that of patients with other diseases (P<0.03), with a fluctuation of 0.2 to 0.5 degrees C; and following a pattern of variation similar to those of the other diseases. Of the 4 time points of daily measurement, namely 6, 10, 14 and 18 o'clock, the temperature measured at 14 o'clock was significantly higher than those at the other 3 time points (P<0.001). Hormone therapy did not significantly affect the temperature of SARS patients (P=0.180), who had longer duration of high fever. CONCLUSION SARS patients have higher body temperature and longer duration of high fever. Hormone therapy may not produce significant effect in controlling the temperature of SARS patients.","Chen, Ping-yan; Liu, Li; Liu, Ding-li; Mo, Yi-xin; Zhang, Chao; Ou, Chun-quan; Wang, Shu-ping; Yang, Hai-qing; An, Sheng-li",Di 1 jun yi da xue xue bao = Academic journal of the first medical college of PLA,102,16

An inactivated polyvalent adjuvant vaccine has been developed for the prevention and specific prophylaxis of these enteral infections; the vaccine contains bovine rotavirus, bovine coronavirus and three enterotoxigenic serotypes of E. coli with protective antigen K 99. The rotavirus and coronavirus are propagated on the stable cellular line MDBK and inactivated with 0.2% formalin, the Escherichia strains are submersed in the MINCA culture medium during their cultivation and inactivated with 0.5% formalin. The vaccine was prepared as a blend of the same amounts of rotavirus and coronavirus and of such an amount of bacterin so that 1 ml of the vaccine will contain 10(9) bacteria. One part of oil adjuvant was added to five parts of the virus-bacterial blend and the blend was homogenized in the Ultraturax apparatus. The vaccine is to be used for immunization of pregnant cows and heifers; in these animals it induces the production of specific antibodies to all antigens contained in the vaccine. Its immunogenic effects were checked in 32 calves and 38 cows in the herds with the occurrence of diarrheas caused by both enteropathogenic viruses and enterotoxigenic escherichia. It was demonstrated that the inactivation did not influence in either of the viruses the process of inducing the production of specific antibodies, and the antibody response of the calves and heifers after application of 2 ml of complete inactivated vaccine was equally strong as after application of live vaccine containing only rotavirus and coronavirus. The level of the rotavirus antibodies increased on the average 30 times and 200 times, coronavirus antibodies twice and four times. The antibody response to coronavirus was negatively influenced by the relatively high levels of antibodies before vaccination. The antibody response to antigen K 99 was expressive in all cases.","Stĕpánek, J; Salajka, E; Zuffa, A; Mensík, J; Franz, J",Veterinarni medicina,102,1

Here, we define molecular mechanisms that mediate infections of human epithelial cells with human rhinovirus strain 14 (RV14). We demonstrate that RV14 activates p38-MAPKinase (p38-K) in a biphasic time course. Early stimulation of p38-K by RV14 was observed a few minutes after initiation of the infection, while the late increase of p38-K activity occurred 7-12 hrs upon infection. The stimulation of p38-K was mediated by the small G-protein RhoA,which was activated by RV14. Transfection of a genetic construct preventing RhoA activation blocked RV14-induced p38-K activation. Further, integrity of cholesterol and sphingolipid-enriched membrane domains was required for RV14-mediated p38-K activation, which was inhibited by destruction of membrane rafts. The data indicate that RV employs a signaling cascade from membrane rafts via the small G-protein RhoA to p38-K to infect human cells.","Dumitru, Claudia Alexandra; Dreschers, Stephan; Gulbins, Erich","Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology",102,11

However, some children will develop persistent or late wheezing. OBJECTIVE We hypothesized that early and late postbronchiolitis wheezing are determined by distinct clinical, immunologic, and genetic variables. METHODS A cohort of 101 children hospitalized for RSV LRTI was prospectively followed for 6 years. During RSV LRTI, cytokine studies were performed and genetic polymorphisms were determined. Parents performed daily log registration of respiratory symptoms during the first 3 years of follow-up and again at age 6 years during the winter season. RESULTS Distinctive associations for early and late postbronchiolitis wheezing were found. We previously showed that airflow limitation during RSV LRTI as well as convalescent monocyte IL-10 production are associated with early wheezing. These variables were not associated with late wheezing. On the other hand, atopic family history was not associated with early wheezing, but it was associated with late wheezing. Most importantly, the IL-13 Gln allele was associated with late wheezing (odds ratio 3.27, 95% confidence interval 1.32-8.06), but it was not associated with early wheezing. CONCLUSION This study revealed distinct clinical, immunologic, and genetic determinants of early and late wheezing after RSV LRTI, indicating distinct pathophysiological mechanisms. We conclude that late wheezing at age 6 years, but not early postbronchiolitis wheezing, is an asthmatic phenomenon and genetically related to a functional IL-13 polymorphism. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS After RSV LRTI, wheezing at age 6 years is not related to early postbronchiolitis wheezing and represents a distinct disease entity.","Ermers, Marieke J J; Hoebee, Barbara; Hodemaekers, Hennie M; Kimman, Tjeerd G; Kimpen, Jan L L; Bont, Louis",The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,102,12

However a number of them recur locally or metastasize. Recurrences can occur several years after excision of the primary tumour. Complete surgical excision remains the primary modality of treatment. But, in sites where complete excision is not possible, other modalities have been tried with varying success. Here, we describe a SFT of the mesentery of the small intestine, an uncommon manifestation of the tumour, recurring after a period of 19 years in a 55 year old female, and presenting to the Emergency Department as an acute abdomen caused by acute intestinal obstruction. Surgical excision of the tumour was performed together with primary anastomosis of the small intestine.

190498,190498,190498,Molecular mimicry revisited: gut bacteria and multiple sclerosis.,12.788523,8.284216,2006,"We previously demonstrated by site-directed mutagenesis analysis that the amino acid residues at positions 62 and 214 to 216 in the N-terminal region of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) spike (S) protein are important for receptor-binding activity (H. Suzuki and F. Taguchi, J. Virol. 70:2632-2636, 1996). To further identify the residues responsible for the activity, we isolated the mutant viruses that were not neutralized with the soluble form of MHV receptor proteins, since such mutants were expected to have mutations in amino acids responsible for receptor-binding activity. Five soluble-receptor-resistant (srr) mutants isolated had mutations in a single amino acid at three different positions: one was at position 65 (Leu to His) (srr11) in the S1 subunit and three were at position 1114 (Leu to Phe) (srr3, srr4, and srr7) and one was at position 1163 (Cys to Phe) (srr18) in the S2 subunit. The receptor-binding activity examined by a virus overlay protein blot assay and by a coimmunoprecipitation assay showed that srr11 S protein had extremely reduced binding activity, while the srr7 and srr18 proteins had binding activity similar to that of wild-type cl-2 protein. However, when cell surface receptors were used for the binding assay, all srr mutants showed activity similar to that of the wild type or only slightly reduced activity. These results, together with our previous observations, suggest that amino acids located at positions 62 to 65 of S1, a region conserved among the MHV strains examined, are important for receptor-binding activity. We also discuss the mechanism by which srr mutants with a mutation in S2 showed high resistance to neutralization by a soluble receptor, despite their sufficient level of binding to soluble receptors.","Saeki, K; Ohtsuka, N; Taguchi, F",Journal of virology,102,1

In recent years a number of different surgical approaches have been introduced with a view to avoiding the complete section of the hypoglossal nerve, such as the Jump Graft technique. This paper aims to present the results of the Hypoglossal-Facial nerve Jump Graft technique in relation to facial musculature reanimation capability and hemitongue function preservation. METHODS A retrospective analysis of the records of eight patients submitted to Hypoglossal-Facial nerve Jump Graft technique was performed. The surgical approach was characterised by the interposition of a short graft sutured to the distal stump of the transected facial nerve and sutured end-to-side to the hypoglossi, with cutting of only a third of the diameter of the latter. FINDINGS The facial nerve injuries were secondary to temporal bone trauma in five cases and to cerebellopontine angle tumour surgery in three. Grafts were harvested from the greater auricular nerve in six patients and from the sural nerve in two. The results of facial reanimation demonstrated facial symmetry and improvement in the facial tone in all cases, and classified as House-Brackmann grade IV in three (37.5%) and grade III in five (62.5%) patients. There was no incidence of definitive hemitongue atrophy and no patient complaint of swallowing or speech difficulty. CONCLUSIONS The modification of the conventional technique of Hypoglossal-Facial nerve anastomosis by means of sectioning one third of the hypoglossal nerve area does not lead to dysfunction of this nerve and the surgical results in terms of facial reanimation are satisfactory.","Flores, L P",Acta neurochirurgica,102,9

The pandemic has altered people's living norms, yet coherently escalating countries' socioeconomic instability. This real-time consensus review aims to describe the epidemiological trends of COVID-19 pandemic across six South-East Asian nations, and countryspecific experiences on pandemic preparedness, responses and interventions. METHODS Consensus-driven approach between authors from the six selected countries was applied. Country specific policy documents, official government media statements, mainstream news portals, global statistics databases and latest published literature available between January-October 2020 were utilised for information retrieval. Situational and epidemiological trend analyses were conducted. Country-specific interventions and challenges were described. Based on evidence appraised, a descriptive framework was considered through a consensus. The authors subsequently outlined the lessons learned, challenges ahead and interventions that needs to be in place to control the pandemic. RESULTS The total number of people infected with COVID-19 between 1 January and 16 November 2020 had reached 48,520 in Malaysia, 58,124 in Singapore, 3,875 in Thailand, 470,648 in Indonesia, 409,574 in Philippines and 70,161 in Myanmar. The total number of people infected with COVID- 19 in the six countries from January to 31 October 2020 were 936,866 cases and the mortality rate was 2.42%. Indonesia had 410,088 cases with a mortality rate of 3.38%, Philippines had 380,729 cases with a mortality rate of 1.90%, Myanmar had 52,706 cases with a mortality rate of 2.34%, Thailand had 3,780 cases with a mortality rate of 1.56%, Malaysia had 31,548 cases with a mortality rate of 0.79%, and Singapore had 58,015 cases with a mortality rate of 0.05% over the 10- month period. Each country response varied depending on its real-time situations based on the number of active cases and economic situation of the country. CONCLUSION The number of COVID-19 cases in these countries waxed and waned over the 10-month period, the number of cases may be coming down in one country, and vice versa in another. Each country, if acting alone, will not be able to control this pandemic. Sharing of information and resources across nations is the key to successful control of the pandemic. There is a need to reflect on how the pandemic affects individuals, families and the community as a whole. There are many people who cannot afford to be isolated from their families and daily wage workers who cannot afford to miss work. Are we as a medical community, only empathising with our patients or are we doing our utmost to uphold them during this time of crisis? Are there any other avenues which can curb the epidemic while reducing its impact on the health and socio-economic condition of the individual, community and the nation?","Rampal, L; Liew, B S; Choolani, M; Ganasegeran, K; Pramanick, A; Vallibhakara, S A; Tejativaddhana, P; Hoe, V C",The Medical journal of Malaysia,102,12

However, substantial changes in Chinese society have been followed by a resurgent epidemic of sexually transmitted diseases. Sporadic reports have provided clues to the magnitude of the spread of syphilis, but a national surveillance effort is needed to provide data for planning and intervention. METHODS We collected and assessed case report data from China's national sexually transmitted disease surveillance system and sentinel site network. FINDINGS In 1993, the reported total rate of cases of syphilis in China was 0.2 cases per 100,000, whereas primary and secondary syphilis alone represented 5.7 cases per 100,000 persons in 2005. The rate of congenital syphilis increased greatly with an average yearly rise of 71.9%, from 0.01 cases per 100,000 livebirths in 1991 to 19.68 cases per 100 000 livebirths in 2005. INTERPRETATION The results suggest that a range of unique biological and social forces are driving the spread of syphilis in China. A national campaign for detection and treatment of syphilis, and a credible prevention strategy, are urgently needed.","Chen, Zhi-Qiang; Zhang, Guo-Cheng; Gong, Xiang-Dong; Lin, Charles; Gao, Xing; Liang, Guo-Jun; Yue, Xiao-Li; Chen, Xiang-Sheng; Cohen, Myron S",Lancet,102,28

Although the motor dysfunction (bradykinesia, tremor, rigidity) of Parkinson's Disease is well described in the literature, the nonmotor dysfunction related to autonomic system changes is not as commonly addressed. Ironically, nonmotor changes, such as seborrhea, sialorrhea, hyperhidrosis, and sensory denervation occur earlier in the disease process and exert a profound effect on patients' quality of life. The depletion of dopamine, a critically important neurotransmitter, is the critical pathology of Parkinson's disease. Therapies targeting this abnormality and the effect of insufficient dopamine itself can affect the integumentary system and potentially wound healing. The purpose of this review is to describe changes in the autonomic nervous system due to Parkinson's Disease with a focused overview of common skin and wound care issues that may affect wound care clinician practice. Implications for nurses and other clinicians caring for Parkinson's Disease patients include surveillance for melanoma and other skin cancers, skin protection against excessive moisture or the effects of insufficient moisture, monitoring of wound healing progress, and interventions to prevent or ameliorate complications of immobility.","Beitz, Janice M",Ostomy/wound management,102,19

METHODS Questionnaires were sent to all doctors, nurses and healthcare assistants (HCA) working in the ED of all public hospitals. The overall degree of mental distress was measured by a single-item 11-point Likert scale. The source of distress was measured by an 18-item questionnaire, which was designed based on the experience of clinical psychologist colleagues providing counselling to staff taking care of SARS patients. The Brief Cope questionnaire was used to study coping strategies adopted by staff. RESULTS A total of 1260 questionnaires were sent out and the response rate was approximately 37%. The mean overall distress level was 6.19 out of a 10-point scale. The mean overall distress levels for doctors, nurses and HCA were 5.91, 6.52 and 5.44, respectively (F(2,420)=6.47, P<0.005). The overall distress level for nurses was significantly higher than for HCA (P<0.005) but not doctors. The overall distress level was highly and significantly correlated with the six sources of distress: vulnerability/loss of control (r=0.68); health of self (r=0.62); spread of virus (r=0.60); health of family and others (r=0.59); changes in work (r=0.46); being isolated (r=0.45). The scores for nurses were significantly higher than for doctors in terms of the six sources of distress (all P values <0.01). HCA were significantly higher than doctors (but not nurses) in worrying about their family's and others' health (P<0.05). In terms of coping strategies, doctors were significantly more likely than nurses and HCA to use planning (P<0.05 and <0.01 respectively); nurses were significantly more likely than doctors to use behavioural disengagement (P<0.01); whereas HCA were significantly more likely than doctors to use self distractions (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS SARS had caused a significant level of distress among ED staff. The distress level was highest for nurses, followed by doctors and HCA. The three most important variables that could account for the distress level were loss of control/vulnerability, fear for self-health and spread of the virus. Overall, the more frequently adopted coping strategies were acceptance, active coping, and positive framing.","Wong, Tai W; Yau, Josephine K Y; Chan, Cecilia L W; Kwong, Rosalie S Y; Ho, Samuel M Y; Lau, Chor C; Lau, Fei L; Lit, Chau H",European journal of emergency medicine : official journal of the European Society for Emergency Medicine,102,1

This technique is used for several surgical procedures. This paper documents a new and cheaper access method known as ""surgical glove port"" or ""homemade single-port"", and describes our initial experience with 25 cases. METHOD Eleven cholecystectomies, eight totally extraperitoneal inguinal hernia repairs, three splenectomies, two gastric wedge resections, and one anti-reflux procedure were performed. RESULTS Twenty-four procedures out of twenty-five were completed without conversion to open or multiple port techniques. An individual patient who had both cholelithiasis and gastrointestinal stromal tumor underwent both cholecystectomy and gastric wedge resection in the same session with surgical glove port technique. In another case two additional 5-mm incisions were made for hemostasis. The additional operation was required and performed by using surgical glove port for a hiatal hernia repair case, because of postoperative hemorrhage. CONCLUSION Single-port laparoscopic surgery is an applicable technique for plenty of surgical procedures.

In France, 5 probable cases of SARS were diagnosed until May 2003. We report the case of one of the 5 French cases, hospitalized successively in Besançon then in Strasbourg. OBSERVATION This 54 year-old man was infected during the Air France flight from Hanoi to Paris via Bangkok by the index case, who himself had been contaminated at the French hospital in Hanoi and who was hospitalized in a critical state in the Tourcoing hospital shortly after his arrival in France. The first clinical signs (fever and dry cough) appeared 4 days after contact with the index case. The chest X-ray showed a pulmonary consolidation 6 days after the first clinical symptoms. Blood test revealed deep lymphopenia and elevated LDH. The patient finally recovered with a treatment combining ribavirin and steroids. CONCLUSION The clinical symptoms of SARS are unspecific and its evolution may be misleading. The epidemiological context (contact with the index case) is a key point for the diagnosis.

The purpose of this study was to: 1) evaluate the mean load to failure of different sutures, and 2) compare the mean load to failure of the sutures after soaking in four different antiseptic solutions. MATERIALS AND METHODS Load-to-failure tests were conducted on four sets of comparable sutures (eight sutures) from two different companies Ethicon Inc. (Somerville, New Jersey) and Covidien (Mansfield, Massachusetts). The four suture types included: 1) non-absorbable braided polyethylene, 2) absorbable braided glycolide or lactide polymer, 3) absorbable monofilament polydioxanone or polyglyconate, and 4) absorbable monofilament polyglecaprone or gylcomer. Sutures were tested for tensile strength at baseline (i.e., no solution; n=5 per suture), and were then soaked for five minutes in one of four different antiseptic solutions: 0.125% sodium hypochlorite, 4% chlorhexidine gluconate, 10% povidone-iodine, and a 1:1 ratio of 3% hydrogen peroxide and sterile water. Effects of the different solutions on individual sutures were assessed with analysis of variance, and pairwise comparison tests were performed with post-hoc Tukey tests. RESULTS For the controls, the mean failure loads for the type 1 sutures were 118.5 N and 120.3 N, for the type 2 sutures, 145.8 N and 155.4 N, the type 3 sutures, 103.8 N and 162.2 N, and the type 4 sutures, 86.9 N and 87.7 N. After being soaked in sodium hypochlorite, the mean failure load decreased for one of the type 2 sutures (mean difference, -12.8 N;p=0.003), while the other type 2 suture had a decreased failure load after soaking in povidone-iodine (mean difference, -10.3 N;p=0.041) and hydrogen peroxide (mean difference, -14.6 N;p=0.001). A type 1 suture had an increased load to failure after soaking in povidone-iodine (mean difference, 13.2 N;p<0.0001) and hydrogen peroxide (mean difference, 10.5 N;p<0.0001). CONCLUSION Certain sutures may have changes in their breaking point depending on what type of antiseptic solution is used for wound irrigation, but due to the small magnitude of change, this may not necessarily be clinically relevant.","Newman, Jared M; George, Jaiben; Shepherd, Jeffery T; Klika, Alison K; Higuera, Carlos A; Krebs, Viktor E",Surgical technology international,102,1

We used monoclonal antibodies specifically directed against N protein to establish a sensitive antigen capture sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of SARS-CoV. The assay employed a mixture of three monoclonal antibodies for capture and rabbit polyclonal antibodies for detection of serum antigen in 32 cases of clinically probable SARS as defined by the World Health Organization during the epidemic in Guangzhou, China. Recombinant N protein was used as a standard to establish a detection sensitivity of approximated 50 pg/ml. The linear range of detection in clinical specimens was from 100 pg/ml to 3.2 ng/ml. Using a panel of sera collected at different points in time, the amount of circulating N antigen was found to peak 6 to 10 days after the onset of symptoms. The sensitivity of the assay was 84.6% in 13 serologically confirmed SARS patients with blood taken during the first 10 days after the onset of symptoms (11 of 13).

The national trend shows no sign of decrease as 19 September 2020 the report sets a new mark of 4000 new cases in a day. The concept of controlling disease transmission relies on contacts suppression; and on the longer end, relies on vaccinations. As 27 September 2020, no vaccine is approved for use in the general population. Until then, countries should implement early, widespread, and strict disease mitigation strategies. While much remains to be learned on COVID-19, global evidence assert at least three strategies at the population level contributes to flatten the curve: mobility restriction, testing and isolation and rigorous contact-tracing.Indonesia is not on entire absences of actions, but the epidemic calls for more. The central government called for social distancing two weeks after the first case confirmed and regulation on the large scale social distancing (Pembatasan Sosial Berskala Besar/ PSBB) that restrict non-essential population mobility is enacted by April 2020. Recent evidence outlines test, tracing and isolation are effective in suppressing COVID-19 transmission. Minimizing testing and tracing delay, less than four days with coverage of 80% close contacts could prevent and reduce onwards transmission.That we need to more is indisputable. The vaccine is not a magic bullet; it is a long-term control measure and should be a complete series of careful and precise examinations. Indonesia will also likely require high coverage of vaccination to achieve herd immunity. At present, if there is no significant improvement in the coverage of preventive measures in the population and disease surveillance system, our hospital will be overwhelmed, and case fatality will be devastating.","Ariawan, Iwan; Jusril, Hafizah",Acta medica Indonesiana,102,30

Group B rotaviruses are associated with sporadic cases of diarrhea in calves and adult cows. From diagnostic submissions to our laboratory, 90 fecal samples from cases of calf diarrhea, 81 fecal samples from cases of adult cow diarrhea (winter dysentery), and 20 fecal samples from case control normal adult cows were tested for group B rotaviruses by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), and reverse transcription (RT)-PCR (targeting 279 bp of the VP7 gene). In addition, 53 fecal samples from diarrheic adult cows were tested for group B rotaviruses by immune electron microscopy (IEM). By RT-PCR, five samples from calves were group B rotavirus positive (5.6%). Fifteen samples from adult cows with diarrhea were group B rotavirus positive (18.5%), and none of the control fecal samples from normal cows were positive for group B rotaviruses. By PAGE, one calf sample (RT-PCR positive) was group B rotavirus positive (short electropherotype), but none of the adult cow samples were positive for group B rotaviruses. By IEM, 5 (9.4%) of the 53 fecal samples from diarrheic adult cows were group B positive (all were also RT-PCR positive). The VP7 genes of three strains (WD653 from an adult cow and the ATI and Mebus calf strains) were sequenced. The VP7 genes from the three bovine strains showed high (over 90%) nucleotide and deduced amino acid homologies, but lower homologies (48 to 61%) were seen between these genes and the genes from rodent (IDIR) and human (ADRV) group B rotaviruses. Although there were some differences of degree, all inoculated gnotobiotic calves (n = 6) showed abnormal feces between 1 and 3 days after inoculation with each of three strains of group B bovine rotaviruses, and group B rotaviruse, were detected in the feces for up to 2 weeks by RT-PCR but for shorter periods by PAGE or IEM.","Chang, K O; Parwani, A V; Smith, D; Saif, L J",Journal of clinical microbiology,102,1

METHODS Standardized questionnaire was used to conduct case investigation and contact tracing by combining the field investigation and telephone interview. Transmission process, infectivity, transmission chain and contact history of SARS were studied through data analyses. RESULTS On 25th March 2003, a 91 year old man was admitted to Hospital J in Beijing with stroke and fever. He died on 30th March. From 31st March, there was an outbreak of SARS among his contacts in the family and in the hospital he was admitted to. Contacts would include his relatives, other co-patients and health care workers in the Hospital J. Chinese Field Epidemiology Training Program trainees conducted an investigation of the outbreak. Among the 207 contacts of the index cases through different generations, there were 36 cases of SARS (attack rate 17%) patients with one death. There were 12 cases having directly contact with the index case and 13 cases with one secondary case. The transmission chains of this outbreak could clearly be depicted. All the cases had close contacts during the symptomatic period of their index patients. Among the relatives, 85% of the cases had 3 - 5-day contact with their index patients after the onset of the illnesses. There was no significant difference between the two attack rates-70% for whose who had contact with the patient before and after illness onset) and 67% for those who only had contact after the onset of the illness. Out of the 44 social acquaintances and 38 of the family members who had contacts with the index patients during the incubation period, no one was found ill. Among the close contacts at the hospital who had no protection when providing care to the patient, the attack rate was found over 80%. CONCLUSIONS All the secondary cases of this outbreak had a history of direct and close contacts to the index patients after the onset of the illness. There was no evidence indicating that SARS cases were infectious during their incubation period.","Xie, Shu-yun; Zeng, Guang; Lei, Jie; Li, Qun; Li, Hai-bei; Jia, Qi-bin",Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,102,15

This review examines recent research studies in humans to determine whether mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) may be used effectively and safely to target potentially deadly lung damage that may follow infection. METHODS A literature search was conducted to find published manuscripts on the treatment of ARDS and COVID-19 symptoms, disease presentation, and available treatment regimens. Electronic data bases of scientific articles and records of printed documents of JAMA journals were searched to find research publications on MSC treatment of ARDS and COVID-19. Outcome variables included mortality over varying time periods, hospital days, days on ventilator, and biological factors. RESULTS Two randomized double-blind clinical trials, 2 pilot studies, and 2 case reports described MSC use to treat ARDS with specific focus on COVID-19 and lung symptoms of cytokine storm. The MSCs were well-tolerated across studies. No significant differences in treatment outcome were found in randomized double-blind trials; however, results of 1 pilot study and 1 case report showed that MSCs led to lung symptom resolution and survival in severely ill treatment patients. CONCLUSIONS There is little published research on disease and survival outcomes among patients suffering severe lung disease associated with ARDS and COVID-19, and studies available are limited by lack of consistency in design and numerous flaws and limitations. Comparisons across studies are difficult. Nevertheless, it is documented that 8 ARDS patients with COVID-19 experienced symptom recovery and survival subsequent to MSC administration. MSCs are potentially life-saving treatment approaches for some patients who exhibit severe lung distress and have not responded to standard treatments. This is an obviously exciting research and treatment option for COVID-19 and other life-threatening diseases.","Kaye, Rachel J",Pain physician,102,33

Because of the impact of SARS on the Radiology Department, the department established a SARS emergency infection control team and re-designed the department's infection-control and emergency-management procedures based on the concept of risk-grade protection. This effort included installing a radiographic room at the fever-screening station, re-allocating human resources in the Radiology Department, training the department staff in infection control, and drafting new operational procedures for radiographers conducting X-ray examinations on SARS patients.

On the basis of previous research with adults, this choice was thought to cause dissonance because it conflicted with subjects' belief that the two options were equally valuable. We therefore expected subjects to change their attitude toward the unchosen alternative, deeming it less valuable. We then presented subjects with a choice between the unchosen option and an option that was originally as attractive as both options in the first choice. Both groups preferred the novel over the unchosen option in this experimental condition, but not in a control condition in which they did not take part in the first decision. These results provide the first evidence of decision rationalization in children and nonhuman primates.

This study was undertaken to study the clinical profile, incidence, severity, requirement of renal replacement therapy, and the outcomes of COVID-19 patients with Acute Kidney Injury admitted in the Intensive Care Unit. MATERIALS AND METHODS A prospective observational study was conducted at a tertiary hospital recognized as Dedicated COVID Hospital during the period of May 2020 to September 2020. 218 patients hospitalised in the Intensive Care Unit during this period were monitored for the development of Acute Kidney Injury. The clinical profile, laboratory findings, requirement of invasive ventilation and renal replacement therapy, and outcomes of such patients were recorded. Data was analysed using the SPSS software. RESULTS Among all the patients enrolled in the Intensive Care Unit during the study period, 27.06% developed Acute Kidney Injury. 67.79% of these patients developed AKI during the first five days of hospitalisation. 76.27% of the patients with AKI required invasive mechanical ventilation, while 28.81% required renal replacement therapy. There was a significant association between the development of Acute Kidney Injury and the requirement of invasive mechanical ventilation (p = 0.0000015). 44.68% of the deaths among the 218 patients were associated with COVID-19 related AKI (p = 0.0000003).

Twenty healthy male athletes (age between 18-30 years) voluntarily participated in this study. All of the subjects visited the laboratory to complete the following intervention in a randomized order on 5 separate days; (a) non-stretching (control), (b) static stretching of the quadriceps muscles, (c) static stretching of the hamstring muscles, (d) dynamic stretching of the quadriceps muscles, and (e) dynamic stretching of the hamstring muscles. Static stretching exercises either for the quadriceps or the hamstring muscles were carried out at the standing and sitting positions. Subjects performed four successive repetitions of each stretching exercises for 30 seconds in both stretching positions. Similar to static stretching exercises two different stretching modes were designed for dynamic stretching exercises. Concentric and eccentric isokinetic peak torque for the non-stretched antagonist quadriceps or hamstring muscles at angular velocities of 60°/sec and 240°/sec and their concurrent electromyographic (EMG) activities were measured before and immediately after the intervention. Isokinetic peak torques of the non-stretched agonist hamstring and quadriceps muscles did not represent any significant (p > 0.05) differences following static and dynamic stretching of the antagonist quadriceps and hamstring muscles, respectively. Similarly, the EMG activities of the agonist muscles exhibited no significant alterations (p > 0.05) following both stretching exercises of the antagonist muscles. According to the results of the present study it is possible to state that antagonist stretching exercises either in the static or dynamic modes do not affect the isokinetic peak torques and the EMG activities of the non-stretched agonist quadriceps or hamstring muscles.","Serefoglu, Abdullah; Sekir, Ufuk; Gür, Hakan; Akova, Bedrettin",Journal of sports science & medicine,102,12

OBJECTIVE The current study reports the long-term effectiveness and safety of this new treatment modality. DESIGN This was a prospective multicenter pilot study. SETTINGS The study was performed at 4 clinical sites in Europe and the United States. PATIENTS The cohort included patients with severe fecal incontinence for ≥6 months who had previously failed conservative therapy and were implanted with a magnetic anal sphincter device between 2008 and 2011. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Adverse events, symptom severity, quality of life, and bowel diary data were collected. RESULTS A total of 35 patients (34 women) underwent magnetic anal sphincter augmentation. The median length of follow-up was 5.0 years (range, 0-5.6 years), with 23 patients completing assessment at 5 years. Eight patients underwent a subsequent operation (7 device explantations) because of device failure or complications, 7 of which occurred in the first year. Therapeutic success rates, with patients who underwent device explantation or stoma creation counted as treatment failures, were 63% at year 1, 66% at year 3 and 53% at year 5.

S protein, that is recognized by the cellular receptor, has been proposed that plays an essential role in controlling the dominant tropism. The genetic relationship of S gene from different enteric strains and non-enteropathogenic porcine respiratory coronaviruses (PRCVs) was determined. A correlation between tropism and the genetic structure of the S gene was established. PRCVs, derived from enteric isolates have a large deletion at the N-terminus of the S protein. Interestingly, two respiratory isolates, attenuated Purdue type virus (PTV-ATT) and Toyama (TOY56) have a full-length S gene. PTV-ATT has two specific amino acid differences with the S protein of the enteric viruses. One is located around position 219, within the deleted area, suggesting that alterations around this amino acid may result in the loss of enteric tropism. To study the role of different genes in tropism, a cluster of viruses closely related to PUR46 strain was analyzed. All of them have been originated by accumulating point mutations from a common, virulent isolate which infected the enteric tract. During their evolution these viruses have lost, virulence first, and then, enteric tropism. Sequencing analysis proved that enteric tropism could be lost without changes in ORFs 3a, 3b, 4, 6, and 7, and in 3'-end untranslated regions (3'-UTR). To study the role of the S protein in tropism recombinants were obtained between an enteric and a respiratory virus of this cluster. Analysis of the recombinants supported the hypothesis on the role in tropism of S protein domain around position 219.","Ballesteros, M L; Sánchez, C M; Martin-Caballero, J; Enjuanes, L",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,102,12

Nevertheless, mucosal immunity functions essentially independently from peripheral immunity. In our study, 27 immune mediators were profiled in parallel, in nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) and plasma from 22 < 2 year-old children with a severe respiratory syncytial virus infection involving the lower respiratory tract, using a multiplex assay. NPAs from 22 children with innocent heart murmurs were used as controls. Differences in mediator concentrations between NPAs from patients and controls were assessed using the Mann-Whitney test. Ratios of innate/adaptive-immunity mediators, Th2/Th1-cytokines and CXC/CC-chemokines were calculated for NPAs and plasmas and differences were assessed using the Wilcoxon test. Associations mediators, severity and leukocyte counts were studied using the Spearman-Karber test. RESULTS increased levels of Th1 cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-12p70, IFNgamma, TNFalpha), Th2 cytokines (IL-13, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10), chemokines (IP-10, IL-8, MIP1alpha, MIP-1beta), growth factors (FGFb, PDGFbb, GCSF) and IL-1RA, IL-17 were observed in patient NPAs in comparison to controls. In the relative comparisons between patient NPAs and plasmas, a predominance of innate immunity mediators, Th2 cytokines and CXC chemokines was found at the mucosal level. No association between the level of each mediator in NPAs and plasma was found. In plasma, PDGFbb, VEGF, MIP-1alpha, IL-8 correlated with severity; RANTES and IL-6 correlated with leukocyte counts. CONCLUSIONS acute respiratory syncytial virus infection induces a relative predominance of innate-immunity mediators, Th2 cytokines and CXC chemokines in the mucosal compartment in infected children.","Bermejo-Martin, Jesus F; Garcia-Arevalo, Maria C; De Lejarazu, Raul Ortiz; Ardura, Julio; Eiros, Jose M; Alonso, Ana; Matías, Vanesa; Pino, Maria; Bernardo, David; Arranz, Eduardo; Blanco-Quiros, Alfredo",European cytokine network,102,19

To explore the possible molecular mechanisms of the invasion and virulence of SARS-CoV, we investigated the structural basis of the viral proteins using computational biology. Forty-five motifs relating to superantigens, toxins and other bioactive molecules were detected in the proteins of SARS-CoV. The results showed that the distribution of the motifs varied in different proteins. Enzyme-like motifs were located in the R protein, while ICAM- 1-like and toxin-like molecules were located in the spike, envelop, nucleocapsid, PUP1, PUP 2 and PUP 4 proteins. Comparison of SARS-CoV with other viruses (OC43, PEDV, HRSV, HHerpV and HAdenoV) showed that each group of motifs was different for each type of virus. Data suggest that the proteins of SARS-CoV with toxic motifs might play crucial roles in targeting host cells and interfering with the immune system.

The main objectives of this paper were to review the regulatory measures for plastic waste reduction and recycling, analyse the trend changes on the recycled amounts of regulated plastic containers and also address the discussions on the impacts of COVID-19 on the expected increase in plastic waste. In the past two decades, the central competent authority (i.e. Environmental Protection Administration (EPA)) in Taiwan has promulgated some regulations governing plastic waste reduction and recycling, especially plastic containers. Based on the official statistics, it showed that total certified amounts of regulated plastic containers have increased from 45,552 tonnes in 1998 to 194,133 tonnes in 2019. This shift was in line with circular economy policies by the Zero Waste Program and Resource Recycling and Reuse Plan launched by the Taiwan EPA during this period. On the other hand, the COVID-19 pandemic will impact on the regulatory policies for plastic waste management because the excess use of regulated plastic products will be temporarily permitted due to the epidemic prevention and control measures. Although the increased proportion of plastic waste in municipal solid waste (MSW) will be beneficial for the energy efficiencies of waste-to-power systems in MSW incineration plants, the recycling and reduction rates of regulated plastic containers or products could decline during the COVID-19 breakout.","Tsai, Wen-Tien",Waste Manag Res,102,4

Respiratory injuries are major COVID-19 related complications, leading to poor lung circulation, tissue scarring, and airway obstruction. Despite an in-depth investigation of respiratory injury's molecular pathogenesis, effective treatments have yet to be developed. Moreover, early detection of viral infection is required to halt the disease-related long-term complications, including respiratory injuries. The currently employed detection technique (quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction or qRT-PCR) failed to meet this need at some point because it is costly, time-consuming, and requires higher expertise and technical skills. Polymer-based nanobiosensing techniques can be employed to overcome these limitations. Polymeric nanomaterials have the potential for clinical applications due to their versatile features like low cytotoxicity, biodegradability, bioavailability, biocompatibility, and specific delivery at the targeted site of action. In recent years, innovative polymeric nanomedicine approaches have been developed to deliver therapeutic agents and support tissue growth for the inflamed organs, including the lung. This review highlights the most recent advances of polymer-based nanomedicine approaches in infectious disease diagnosis and treatments. This paper also focuses on the potential of novel nanomedicine techniques that may prove to be therapeutically efficient in fighting against COVID-19 related respiratory injuries.","Rana, Md Mohosin",J Biomater Sci Polym Ed,102,20

The Portuguese health authorities are currently using some decision analysis-like techniques to assess the impact of this pandemic and implementing measures for each county, region, or the whole country. Such decision tools led to some criticism and many stakeholders asked for novel approaches, in particular those having in consideration dynamical changes in the pandemic behavior arising, e.g., from new virus variants or vaccines. A multidisciplinary team formed by researchers of the Covid-19 Committee of Instituto Superior T\'ecnico at Universidade de Lisboa (CCIST analysts team) and medical doctors from the Crisis Office of the Portuguese Medical Association (GCOM experts team) gathered efforts and worked together in order to propose a new tool to help politicians and decision-makers in the combat of the pandemic.

A multiple criteria approach based on an additive multi-attribute value theory (MAVT) aggregation model was used to construct the pandemic assessment composite indicator (PACI). The parameters of the additive model were built through a sociotechnical co-constructive interactive process between CCIST and GCOM team members.

METHODS: Using a community practice-based rheumatologist network, we examined trends in in-person vs. telehealth visits vs. canceled visits in three time periods: pre-COVID19, COVID19-Transition (6-weeks beginning 3/23/20), and post-COVID19-Transition (May-August). In the Transition period, we compared patients who received in-person care vs. telehealth visits vs. cancelled all visits. We used multivariable logistic regression to identify factors associated with canceled or telehealth visits. RESULTS: Pre-COVID19, there were 7,075 visits/week among 60,002 unique rheumatology patients cared for by approximately 300 providers practicing in 92 offices. This decreased substantially (24.6% reduction) during COVID19-Transition period for in-person but rebounded to pre-COVID19 levels during post-COVID19 transition. There were almost no telehealth visits pre-COVID19, but telehealth increased substantially during the COVID19-Transition (41.4% of all follow-up visits) and slightly decreased during post-COVID19-Transition (27.7% of visits). Older age, female sex, Black or Hispanic race/ethnicity, lower socioeconomic status, and rural residence were associated with greater likelihood of cancelling visits. Most factors were also associated with a lower likelihood of having telehealth vs. in-office visits. Patients living further from the rheumatologists' office were more likely to use telehealth. CONCLUSION: COVID19 led to large disruptions in rheumatology care; these disruptions were only partially offset by increases in telehealth use and disproportionately affected racial/ethnic minorities and patients with lower socioeconomic status. During the COVID-19 era, telehealth continues to be an important part of rheumatology practice, but disparities in access to care exist for some vulnerable groups.","George, Michael; Danila, Maria I; Watrous, Daniel; Reddy, Shanmugapriya; Alper, Jeffrey; Xie, Fenglong; Nowell, W Benjamin; Kallich, Joel; Clinton, Cassie; Saag, Kenneth G; Curtis, Jeffrey R",Arthritis care &amp; research (2010 : Online),102,6

Such interventions may consider modifying the identified factors of vaccination intention, including strengthening perceived efficacy, positive feelings about vaccination, the need to avoid future regret, self-efficacy, and social norms. Future studies should examine the actual behavior patterns of COVID-19 vaccination and testing the efficacy of promotion intervention through randomized controlled studies.","She, Rui; Chen, Xi; Li, Liping; Li, Lijuan; Huang, Zepeng; Lau, Joseph T F",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,102,23

Here, we instead use satellite observations together with bottom-up information to track the daily dynamics of CO$_2$ emissions during the pandemic. Unlike activity data, our observation-based analysis can be independently evaluated and can provide more detailed insights into spatially-explicit changes. Specifically, we use TROPOMI observations of NO$_2$ to deduce ten-day moving averages of NO$_x$ and CO$_2$ emissions over China, differentiating emissions by sector and province. Between January and April 2020, China's CO$_2$ emissions fell by 11.5% compared to the same period in 2019, but emissions have since rebounded to pre-pandemic levels owing to the fast economic recovery in provinces where industrial activity is concentrated.","Zheng, Bo; Geng, Guannan; Ciais, Philippe; Davis, Steven J.; Martin, Randall V.; Meng, Jun; Wu, Nana; Chevallier, Frederic; Broquet, Gregoire; Boersma, Folkert; Ronaldvander, A; Lin, Jintai; Guan, Dabo; Lei, Yu; He, Kebin; Zhang, Qiang",,102,16

During the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, huge amount of information is increasingly available in digital information sources and overwhelms the average person. The purpose of this research was to investigate public's information seeking behavior on COVID-19 in Greece. METHOD: The study was conducted through a web-based survey, facilitated by the use of questionnaire posted on the Google Forms platform. The questionnaire consisted of closed-ended, 7-point Likert scale questions and multiple choice questions and was distributed to all over Greek Regions to almost 3.000 recipients, during the implementation of restrictive measures against the COVID-19 outbreak in Spring 2020. The data collected were subjected to a descriptive statistical analysis. The median was used to present the results. In order to perform analysis between genders, as well as age groups, the non-parametric criteria Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis were applied to determine the existence of differences in participants' beliefs. RESULTS: Responses by 776 individuals were obtained. Individuals dedicated up to 2 h per day to be informed on COVID-19. Television, electronic press and news websites were reported by the participants as more reliable than social media, in obtaining information on COVID-19. Respondents paid attention to official sources of information (Ministry of Health, Civil Protection etc.). Family and friends played an additional role in the participants' information on COVID-19, while the personal doctor, other health workers and pharmacists did not appear to be most preferred sources of information on COVID-19. Participants' most common information seeking strategy in digital environment was keyword searching. Unreliable information, fake news and information overload were the most common difficulties that the participants encountered seeking information on COVID-19. The respondents' views seemed to differ significantly among age groups. The older the participants, the more often they were informed by television (p < 0.001) and the less often by the internet (p < 0.001). Females appear to use more frequently internet (p < 0.001) and social media (p = 0.001) out of habit and visit more often the Ministry of Health (p < 0.001) and the Civil Protection (p=0.005) websites, compared to males. Most of the participants seemed to worry about the fake news phenomenon and agreed that fake news on COVID-19 is being spread in the media and especially social networks. CONCLUSION: The study revealed that, during the COVID-19 pandemic in Greece, participants obtained information about the disease mainly by television, electronic press and news websites. On the contrary, the limited use of social media demonstrates the participants awareness of the spread of fake news on social media. This observed information seeking behavior might has contributed to individuals' acceptance of the necessary behavioral changes that had led to the Greek success story in preventing spread of the disease.","Skarpa, Paraskevi El; Garoufallou, Emmanouel",Int J Med Inform,102,16

In particular, since the end of 2020, several variants of concern have been identified around the world, including variants ""alpha"" (B.1.1.7, ""British""), ""beta"" (B.1.351, ""South African""), ""gamma"" (P.1, ""Brazilian"") and ""delta"" (B.1.617.2, ""Indian""). However, the existing mechanism for searching for important mutations and identifying strains may not be effective enough, since only a relatively small fraction of all identified pathogen samples can be examined for genetic changes by whole genome sequencing due to its high cost. In this study, we used the method of targeted high-throughput sequencing of the most significant regions of the gene encoding the S-glycoprotein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, for which a primer panel was developed. Using this technique, we examined 579 random samples obtained from patients in Moscow and the Moscow region with coronavirus infection from February to June 2021. The study demonstrated the dynamics of the representation in the Moscow region of a number of SARS-CoV-2 strains and its most significant individual mutations in the period from February to June 2021. It was found that the strain B.1.617.2 began to spread rapidly in Moscow and the Moscow region in May, and in June it became dominant, partially displacing other varieties of the virus. The results obtained make it possible to accurately determine the belonging of the samples to the abovementioned and some other strains. The approach can be used to standardize the procedure for searching for new and existing epidemiologically significant mutations in certain regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, which allows studying a large number of samples in a short time and to get a more detailed picture of the epidemiological situation in the region.",,,102,16

Recovery from acute respiratory failure (ARF) is usually determined by normalized arterial blood gases (ABGs), but the prevalence of persistent exercise-induced desaturation (EID) and dyspnea is still unknown. METHODS: We investigated the prevalence of EID in 70 patients with normal arterial oxygen at rest after recovery from ARF due to COVID-19 pneumonia. Patients underwent a 6-min walking test (6MWT) before discharge from hospital. We recorded dyspnea score and heart rate during 6MWT. We also investigated the possible role of lung ultrasound (LU) in predicting EID. Patients underwent a LU scan and scores for each explored area were summed to give a total LU score. RESULTS: In 30 patients (43%), oxygen desaturation was >4% during 6MWT. These patients had significantly higher dyspnea and heart rate compared to non-desaturators. LU score >8.5 was significantly able to discriminate patients with EID. CONCLUSION: In SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, ABGs at discharge cannot predict the persistence of EID, which is frequent.

The most favorable epidemic control scenario, which provides long-term protection against COVID-19 outbreak, is the development and distribution of an effective and safe vaccine. The need to develop a new COVID-19 vaccine is pressing; however, it is likely to take a long time, possibly several years. This is due to the time required to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the proposed vaccine. and the time required to manufacture and distribute millions of doses. OBJECTIVES: To accelerate this development and associated safety testing, the deliberate infection of healthy volunteers has been suggested. The purpose of this short communication is to describe the ethical aspects of this type of testing, RESULTS: Deliberate infection of volunteers with a dangerous virus such as SARS-CoV-2 was initially considered unethical by researchers; but the current pandemic is so different from previous ones that these studies are considered ethical if certain criteria are met. Participants in human challenge studies must be relatively young, in good health and must receive the highest quality medical care, with frequent monitoring. Tests should also be performed with great caution and specialized medical supervision. Besides, the fact that obtaining vaccines faster through deliberate infection studies of healthy people has greater benefits than risks, has been demonstrated by obtaining other vaccines in other historical pandemics such as: smallpox, influenza, malaria, typhoid fever, Dengue fever and Zika. CONCLUSIONS: One possibility to shorten the time required for the development of COVID-19 vaccines is to reduce clinical phases II and III by using human challenge studies through eliberate infection of healthy volunteers with SARS-CoV-2 after administration of the candidate vaccine. Accelerating the development of a COVID-19 vaccine even for a few weeks or months would have a great beneficial impact on public health by saving many lives.","Calina, Daniela; Hartung, Thomas; Docea, Anca Oana; Spandidos, Demetrios A; Egorov, Alex M; Shtilman, Michael I; Carvalho, Felix; Tsatsakis, Aristidis",,102,10

A growing body of evidence suggests that asymptomatic and mild infections (together making up over 95% of all infections) are associated with lower antibody titers than severe infections. Antibody levels also peak a few weeks after infection and decay gradually. We developed a statistical approach to produce adjusted estimates of seroprevalence from raw serosurvey results that account for these sources of spectrum bias. We incorporate data on antibody responses on multiple assays from a post-infection longitudinal cohort, along with epidemic time series to account for the timing of a serosurvey relative to how recently individuals may have been infected. We applied this method to produce adjusted seroprevalence estimates from five large-scale SARS-CoV-2 serosurveys across different settings and study designs. We identify substantial differences between reported and adjusted estimates of over two-fold in the results of some surveys, and provide a tool for practitioners to generate adjusted estimates with pre-set or custom parameter values.

They are named as such due to their ability to ‘interfere’ with the viral cell production.There are three forms of interferons-Type I, Type II and Type III. Type I interferons consist of IFN-α, IFN-ß, IFN-ω, IFN-к, IFN-ε that are induced by cytokines and act/bind on the IFNAR receptor. Type II interferon consists only of IFN-४ and is mostly produced by NK cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and B cells. In addition to the antiviral property, they also have antiproliferative effects on tumours. Type III interferon has four types of IFN-λ that act through an FNGR receptor. Interferon has wide activity as an antiviral, antiangiogenic, antiproliferative agent-effectively preventing cancers, chronic viral infections and threatening diseases. Interferon can be applied as systemic or topical based on the treatment to be rendered to the patient-although topical had slight to no side effects. Recently, IFN-ß-1b and IFN-α2b have been studied for their properties in the growing COVID-19 pandemic and have proved to be effective as they show faster relief than other drugs. Although it has various advantages, interferon therapy includes numerous side effects like anxiety, depression, alopecia; mainly causing neurotoxicity and haematotoxicity-neutropenia. Some of these side effects are short and manageable but others may be long and persist after treatment also.

245506,245506,245506,Valinomycin as a potential antiviral agent against coronaviruses: A review,12.48766,7.0461135,2020,"BACKGROUND: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, medical schools suspended clinical rotations. This displacement of medical students from wards has limited experiential learning. Concurrently, outpatient practices are experiencing reduced volumes of in-person visits and are shifting towards virtual healthcare, a transition that comes with its own logistical challenges. This article describes a workflow that enabled medical students to engage in meaningful clinical education while helping an institution's outpatient practices implement remote telemedicine visits. METHODS: A 4-week virtual elective was designed to allow clinical learners to participate in virtual telemedicine patient encounters. Students were prepared with EMR training and introduced to a novel workflow that supported healthcare providers in the outpatient setting. Patients were consented to telehealth services before encounters with medical students. All collected clinical information was documented in the EMR, after which students transitioned patients to a virtual Doxy.me video appointment. Surveys were used to evaluate clinical and educational outcomes of students' participation. Elective evaluations and student reflections were also collected. RESULTS: Survey results showed students felt well-prepared to initiate patient encounters. They expressed comfort while engaging with patients virtually during telemedicine appointments. Students identified clinical educational value, citing opportunities to develop patient management plans consistent with in-person experiences. A significant healthcare burden was also alleviated by student involvement. Over 1000 total scheduled appointments were serviced by students who transitioned more than 80 % of patients into virtual attending provider waiting rooms. CONCLUSIONS: After piloting this elective with fourth-year students, pre-clerkship students were also recruited to act in a role normally associated with clinical learners (e.g., elicit patient histories, conduct a review of systems, etc.). Furthermore, additional telemedicine electives are being designed so medical students can contribute to patient care without risk of exposure to COVID-19. These efforts will allow students to continue with their clinical education during the pandemic. Medical educators can adopt a similar workflow to suit evolving remote learning needs.","Weber, Alec M; Dua, Anoushka; Chang, Kitae; Jupalli, Hamsitha; Rizwan, Farsha; Chouthai, Abhishek; Chen, Catherine",BMC Med Educ,102,16

METHODS: We performed an observational cohort study of all consecutive patients admitted for &#8805;48 hours to the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona for COVID-19 (28 February to 22 April 2020) who were discharged or dead. We describe demographic, epidemiologic, laboratory and microbiologic results, as well as outcome data retrieved from electronic health records. RESULTS: Of a total of 989 consecutive patients with COVID-19, 72 (7.2%) had 88 other microbiologically confirmed infections: 74 were bacterial, seven fungal and seven viral. Community-acquired co-infection at COVID-19 diagnosis was uncommon (31/989, 3.1%) and mainly caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus. A total of 51 hospital-acquired bacterial superinfections, mostly caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli, were diagnosed in 43 patients (4.7%), with a mean (SD) time from hospital admission to superinfection diagnosis of 10.6 (6.6) days. Overall mortality was 9.8% (97/989). Patients with community-acquired co-infections and hospital-acquired superinfections had worse outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Co-infection at COVID-19 diagnosis is uncommon. Few patients developed superinfections during hospitalization. These findings are different compared to those of other viral pandemics. As it relates to hospitalized patients with COVID-19, such findings could prove essential in defining the role of empiric antimicrobial therapy or stewardship strategies.","Garcia-Vidal, Carolina; Sanjuan, Gemma; Moreno-García, Estela; Puerta-Alcalde, Pedro; Garcia-Pouton, Nicole; Chumbita, Mariana; Fernandez-Pittol, Mariana; Pitart, Cristina; Inciarte, Alexy; Bodro, Marta; Morata, Laura; Ambrosioni, Juan; Grafia, Ignacio; Meira, Fernanda; Macaya, Irene; Cardozo, Celia; Casals, Climent; Tellez, Adrian; Castro, Pedro; Marco, Francesc; García, Felipe; Mensa, Josep; Martínez, José Antonio; Soriano, Alex",Clin. microbiol. infect,102,29

DATA SOURCES: The following PubMed literature search terms were used from July 2020 to January 2, 2021: diabetes, COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), glucose-lowering agents, and pharmacology. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: English-language studies reporting on the association between diabetes, COVID-19 adverse outcomes, and the potential roles of glucose-lowering agents were reviewed. DATA SYNTHESIS: Selected glucose-lowering agents have benefits beyond glycemic control, with the potential to reduce the risks of severe complications during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Key benefits include anti-inflammatory, anticoagulant, immune modulating, and enzyme/receptor effects. RELEVANCE TO PATIENT CARE AND CLINICAL PRACTICE: This review summarizes the current knowledge of glucose-lowering agents and their potential roles in COVID-19 outcomes. Considering beneficial mechanisms on COVID-19 outcomes that extend beyond glycemic control as well as safety profiles, current data suggest that dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) inhibitors and metformin may have the most promise and warrant further investigation. CONCLUSIONS: Certain glucose-lowering agents may offer additional benefits beyond glucose control-namely, by modulating the mechanisms contributing to adverse outcomes related to COVID-19 in patients with diabetes. DPP-IV inhibitors and metformin appear to have the most promise. However, current published literature on diabetes medications and COVID-19 should be interpreted with caution. Most published studies are retrospective and consist of convenience samples, and some lack adequate analytical approaches with confounding biases. Ongoing trials aim to evaluate the effects of glucose-lowering agents in reducing the severity of COVID-19 outcomes.","Berlie, Helen D; Kale-Pradhan, Pramodini B; Orzechowski, Tara; Jaber, Linda A",Ann Pharmacother,102,33

We test whether the inter-state differences in mobility influenced changes in reported psychological distress. Our study is not on the surge in COVID-19 in the later part of 2020. OBJECTIVE: To identify whether the change in state-level mobility is associated with the change in individuals' reported psychological distress during the early COVID-19 pandemic and whether the intensity of the association varies by older individuals, females, and nonwhites. METHODS: We use differences in state-level mobility and change in reported psychological distress between the two dates of interviews of 5,132 individuals who participated in March and April 2020 waves of Understanding America Study (UAS). RESULTS: We find support for modest effects, i.e., a one standard deviation decline in mobility was associated with a 3.02% higher psychological distress [95% CI: 0.4%-5.64%], and the effects are robust to controlling for reported changes in exercise intensity, alcohol consumption, cannabis use, recreational drug use, and meditation intensity. We also find support for a stronger association for females, but not for older individuals or non-whites. Further, we do not find support for the mediation effects from change in chance of running out of money or change in chance of getting COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Our findings show that reduced mobility from lockdowns during the early COVID-19 wave in the US is associated with a modest increase in reported psychological distress, especially for females. However, these conclusions should not be construed as a small increase in psychological distress in general, as a variety of non-mobility related factors associated with COVID-19 could have exacerbated psychological distress during the early COVID-19 wave in the US.","Devaraj, Srikant; Patel, Pankaj C",Soc Sci Med,102,20

We aimed to evaluate the effect of concurrent and recurrent temporary closures of EDs on the clinical outcomes of patients who visited EDs during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used a nationwide emergency patient database. Patients who visited one of the 46 EDs in Daegu and Gyeongbuk between January 21 and April 14, 2020 were included. The main exposure variable was the first medical contact (ED visit or 119 call to emergency medical services (EMS)) during closure of at least one ED. There were 25 temporary closures of six Level-1 and Level-2 EDs between February 18 and March 17, 2020. We constructed a dataset by performing bidirectional crossover matching and conducted a conditional logistic regression analysis where the primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Of the 94,360 eligible study participants, 36,327 were classified into the non-EMS-use group and 10,116 were classified into the EMS-use group. In-hospital mortality rates were 2.0% and 1.6% for the temporary-closure and no-closure groups in the non-EMS-use group (p-value, 0.03) and 8.7% and 7.4% in the EMS-use group (p-value, 0.02), respectively. In the conditional logistic analysis for in-hospital mortality, the odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of the temporary-closure group compared the no-closure group were 1.22 (1.03-1.44) among the non-EMS-use group and 1.23 (1.04-1.46) among the EMS-use group. CONCLUSION: The temporary closures of EDs due to the unpredicted COVID-19 exposure resulted in an increase in emergency patients' in-hospital mortality rates irrespective of whether they used EMS.

While the medical research area dedicates efforts to find cures and remedies to counteract the effects of a virus, the engineering area is involved in providing risk assessments in indoor environments by simulating the airborne transmission of the virus during an epidemic. To this end, virus air emission data are needed. Unfortunately, this information is usually available only after the outbreak, based on specific reverse engineering cases. In this work, a novel approach to estimate the viral load emitted by a contagious subject on the basis of the viral load in the mouth, the type of respiratory activity (e.g. breathing, speaking, whispering), respiratory physiological parameters (e.g. inhalation rate), and activity level (e.g. resting, standing, light exercise) is proposed. The results showed that high quanta emission rates (>100 quanta h-1) can be reached by an asymptomatic infectious SARS-CoV-2 subject performing vocalization during light activities (i.e. walking slowly) whereas a symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 subject in resting conditions mostly has a low quanta emission rate (<1 quantum h-1). The findings in terms of quanta emission rates were then adopted in infection risk models to demonstrate its application by evaluating the number of people infected by an asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 subject in Italian indoor microenvironments before and after the introduction of virus containment measures. The results obtained from the simulations clearly highlight that a key role is played by proper ventilation in containment of the virus in indoor environments.","Buonanno, G; Stabile, L; Morawska, L",Environ Int,102,16

The true impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection on immunocompromised CAR T-cell therapy recipients and kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) has not yet been established. CASE PRESENTATION: In this report, we compare two patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia in either the humoral or cell-mediated immunodeficient states. The first patient was a man in his early 30s who was diagnosed with refractory multiple myeloma. He received fully humanized, anti-B-cell maturation antigen, CAR T-cell therapy before 4 months and achieved strict complete remission. He was infected with SARS-CoV-2 starting on January 26, 2019 and gradually progressed to severe pneumonia. Throughout the clinical progression of the disease, SARS-CoV-2 could not be cleared due to his humoral immunodeficient state. During this period of his severe COVID-19 pneumonia, elevated cytotoxic T-cells were observed in this patient's peripheral blood while elevated plasma levels of interleukin (IL)-2R, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor &#945;, and ferritin were observed in his cytokine profiles. This patient eventually progressed into acute respiratory distress syndrome and recieved non-invasive ventilatory support. He failed to generate specific SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and died of respiratory failure on day 33 (d33). The second patient was a 52-year-old kidney transplant recipient (KTR) who took ciclosporin after renal transplantation for more than 7 years. He confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection on January 20, 2019 and gradually progressed into severe pneumonia on d16 with a slightly elevated B-cell percentage and normal T-lymphocyte subsets. Viral clearance occurred together with the generation of specific anti-immunoglobulin G-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies after 2 weeks of treatment. He was symptom-free and discharged from the hospital on d42. CONCLUSION: We report a CAR T-cell therapy recipient diagnosed with COVID-19 for the first time. His virus clearance failure and life-threating cytokine storm during SARS-CoV-2 infection suggested that any decision to proceed CAR T-cell therapy during COVID-19 pandemics will require extensive discussion of potential risks and benefits. Immunosuppressant treatment based on ciclosporin could be relatively safe for KTRs diagnosed with COVID-19.

In this study, we sought to describe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on inpatient use within children's hospitals. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study using the Pediatric Health Information System. We compared inpatient use and clinical outcomes for children 0 to 18 years of age during the COVID-19 period (March 15 to August 29, 2020) to the same time frame in the previous 3 years (pre-COVID-19 period). Adjusted generalized linear mixed models were used to examine the association of the pandemic period with inpatient use. We assessed trends overall and for a subgroup of 15 medical All Patient Refined Diagnosis Related Groups (APR-DRGs). RESULTS: We identified 424 856 hospitalizations (mean: 141 619 hospitalizations per year) in the pre-COVID-19 period and 91 532 in the COVID-19 period. Compared with the median number of hospitalizations in the pre-COVID-19 period, we observed declines in hospitalizations overall (35.1%), and by APR-DRG (range: 8.5%-81.3%) with asthma (81.3%), bronchiolitis (80.1%), and pneumonia (71.4%) experiencing the greatest declines. Overall readmission rates were lower during the COVID-19 period; however, other outcomes, including length of stay, cost, ICU use, and mortality remained similar to the pre-COVID-19 period with some variability by APR-DRGs. CONCLUSIONS: US children's hospitals observed substantial reductions in inpatient admissions with largely unchanged hospital-level outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the impact on use varied by condition, the most notable declines were related to inpatient admissions for respiratory conditions, including asthma, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia.","Markham, Jessica L; Richardson, Troy; DePorre, Adrienne; Teufel, Ronald J; Hersh, Adam L; Fleegler, Eric W; Antiel, Ryan M; Williams, Daniel C; Goldin, Adam B; Shah, Samir S",Pediatrics,102,0

We examined the associations between symptomology, presence of fever, and outcomes of a COVID-19 cohort. METHODS: Between 23rd January to 30th April 2020, 554 COVID-19 patients were admitted to a tertiary hospital in Singapore. They were allocated into 4 groups based on symptomology and fever - Group 1: asymptomatic and afebrile, Group 2: symptomatic but afebrile, Group 3: febrile but asymptomatic, Group 4: symptomatic and febrile. The primary outcomes were intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and mortality. The composite end-point included ICU admissions, mortality or any COVID-19 related end-organ involvement. RESULTS: There were differences in ferritin (p = 0.003), C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (p < 0.001) and lymphopenia (p = 0.033) across all groups, with the most favourable biochemical profile in Group 1, and the least in Group 4. Symptomatic groups (Groups 2 and 4) had higher ICU admissions (1.9% and 6.0%, respectively, p = 0.003) than asymptomatic groups (Groups 1 and 3). Composite end-point was highest in Group 4 (24.0%), followed by Group 3 (8.6%), Group 2 (4.8%) and Group 1 (2.4%) (p < 0.001). The presence of fever (OR 4.096, 95% CI 1.737-9.656, p = 0.001) was associated with the composite end-point after adjusting for age, pulse rate, comorbidities, lymphocyte, ferritin, CRP. Presence of symptoms was not associated with the composite end-point. CONCLUSION: In this COVID-19 cohort, presence of fever was a predictor of adverse outcomes. This has implications on the management of febrile but asymptomatic COVID-19 patients.","Ws Chew, Nicholas; Nicholas Ngiam, Jinghao; Meng Tham, Sai; Yu Lim, Zhen; Yi-Wei Li, Tony; Cen, Shuyun; Soo Yap, Eng; Anantharajah Tambyah, Paul; Santosa, Amelia; Brenda Cross, Gail; Sia, Ching-Hui",QJM,102,1

A community-driven preparedness strategy has been implemented in metropolitan areas in China. The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC) has required that all COVID-19 confirmed cases be recorded and documented in a national notifiable disease surveillance system (NDSS). After receiving reports of newly confirmed cases, an epidemiological services team at the CCDC or trained medical professionals at local clinical facilities start a case-contact investigation. A task force performs home visits to infected individuals. Persons under investigation (PUIs) can stay in designated quarantine facilities for 14 days or in special circumstances can be quarantined at home.

Isolation and loneliness are indirect effects of these preventive measures. Given these premises, monitoring the behavior of the population in the face of these eventualities becomes important. Worry as an indirect measure of anxiety and stress enables one to recognize subjects who are vulnerable to phenomena of high uncertainty, since measures taken to avoid excessive contagion can have high costs for this population. This phenomenon has been consistently observed in other pandemics such as H1/N1 influenza. Objective To determine the prevalence of worry and perceived risk of contagion in the Guadalajara population during the COVID-19 quarantine and to identify differentiating effects. Method A total of 255 people from western Mexico (Guadalajara, Jalisco) voluntarily participated by answering the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ) adapted to Mexican population. The average age of the respondents, aged between 18 and 70 years, was 31.71 (± 5.19). A total of 170 women and 85 men participated in the study. Results 40.12% of the population scored high levels of worry, making them vulnerable to mental health conditions. Subjects favored the prevention of a contagion regardless of whether they were self-isolated. The only variable that had a differential effect was sex (p &lt; .05), and there were no differences in educational attainment, occupational demandingness, and isolation between the groups. Discussion and conclusion A preventive attitude was observed among the participants, and so it is important to implement strategies that will prevent mental health costs in those who express excessive worry to avoid saturating mental health services.","Guzmán-González, Jesua Iván; Sánchez-García, Franco Giordano; Ramírez-de los Santos, Saúl; Gutiérrez-Rodríguez, Francisco; Palomino-Esparza, David; Telles-Martínez, Ana Laura",Salud ment,102,10

METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis using the Vizient Clinical Data Base. We separately compared two cohorts of patients with COVID-19 admitted April 1-October 31, 2020-patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and those with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)-with control patients with ICH or SAH who did not have COVID-19 admitted at the same hospitals in 2019. The primary outcome was in-hospital death. Favorable discharge and length of hospital and intensive-care stay were the secondary outcomes. We fit multivariate mixed-effects logistic regression models to our outcomes. RESULTS: There were 559 ICH-COVID patients and 23,378 ICH controls from 194 hospitals. In the ICH-COVID cohort versus controls, there was a significantly higher proportion of Hispanic patients (24.5% vs. 8.9%), Black patients (23.3% vs. 20.9%), nonsmokers (11.5% vs. 3.2%), obesity (31.3% vs. 13.5%), and diabetes (43.4% vs. 28.5%), and patients had a longer hospital stay (21.6 vs. 10.5 days), a longer intensive-care stay (16.5 vs. 6.0 days), and a higher in-hospital death rate (46.5% vs. 18.0%). Patients with ICH-COVID had an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 2.43 [1.96-3.00] for the outcome of death and an aOR of 0.55 [0.44-0.68] for favorable discharge. There were 212 SAH-COVID patients and 5,029 controls from 119 hospitals. The hospital (26.9 vs. 13.4 days) and intensive-care (21.9 vs. 9.6 days) length of stays and in-hospital death rate (42.9% vs. 14.8%) were higher in the SAH-COVID cohort compared with controls. Patients with SAH-COVID had an aOR of 1.81 [1.26-2.59] for an outcome of death and an aOR of 0.54 [0.37-0.78] for favorable discharge.

While the vaccination has made progress, there has been no study analyzing the federal/union vaccine policy and its effect on vaccination coverage across Indian states. In this context, this study analyses the federal vaccination policy and its effect on interstate variation in vaccine coverage and the correlation of state economy with vaccination coverage. MethodsThe study analyses vaccine policy documents, secondary data on vaccination coverage and state gross domestic product (GDP) available in public domain. ANOVA test has been used to assess the effect of vaccine policy on interstate vaccine coverage and correlation-regression analysis has been conducted to assess the type and strength of association between gross state domestic product and vaccination coverage. ResultsInterstate variation in vaccination coverage in the first 15 weeks was the least (F=3.5), when vaccine procurement and supply was entirely provided by the union/federal government and vaccination was limited to priority groups. However, with the extension of vaccine policy to other groups and reduction in federal government involvement in vaccine procurement, the interstate variation in vaccination coverage increased significantly (F=10.74) by the end of 30 weeks. The highest interstate variation was observed in the period between 23-30 weeks (F=25.31). State GDP was positively and strongly correlated with state vaccination coverage with a high coefficient of correlation (R=0.94) and high coefficient of determination (R2= 0.88). ConclusionsThe study finds that federal procurement and supply of vaccination among prioritized groups has been the best strategy till date to address the inequity in vaccination coverage across the states of India.","Mukherjee, Kanchan",,102,22

The complete epidemic data are available for a complete assessment of epidemiological parameters in all regions and time periods. METHODS: This study aims to present a spatiotemporal epidemic model based on spatially stratified heterogeneity (SSH) to simulate the epidemic spread. A susceptible-exposed/latent-infected-removed (SEIR) model was constructed for each SSH-identified stratum (each administrative city) to estimate the spatiotemporal epidemiological parameters of the outbreak. RESULTS: We estimated that the mean latent and removed periods were 5.40 and 2.13 days, respectively. There was an average of 1.72 latent or infected persons per 10,000 Wuhan travelers to elsewhere until January 20th, 2020. The space-time basic reproduction number (R0) estimates indicate an initial value between 2 and 3.5 in most cities on this date. The mean period for R0 estimates to decrease to 80% and 50% of initial values in cities were an average of 14.73 and 19.62 days, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our model estimates the complete spatiotemporal epidemiological characteristics of the outbreak in a space-time domain, and the findings will help enhance a comprehensive understanding of the outbreak and inform the strategies of prevention and control in other countries worldwide.","Hu, Bisong; Ning, Pan; Qiu, Jingyu; Tao, Vincent; Devlin, Adam Thomas; Chen, Haiying; Wang, Jinfeng; Lin, Hui",Int. j. infect. dis,102,16

Rapid serological tests (RSTs) could be an invaluable tool for HCWs to control COVID-19 transmission. This study assesses the benefits of RSTs for HCWs in Marseille, France. Study design: Mixed-methods exploratory analysis. Methods: A mixed-methods approach was used, combining quantitative and qualitative data, to prospectively analyse acceptability of RSTs, prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and prevention behaviours in 106 HCWs from 18 non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and health or social institutions in Marseille from June 1 to July 31, 2020. For the qualitative dimension, semi-structured individual interviews were conducted with 21 HCWs from 7 of 18 NGOs and institutions. Results: Most of the 106 HCWs in the quantitative study reported better prevention measures at work than in their homes. Despite this, the majority reported that they felt unsafe at work in terms of COVID-19 infection risk. SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroprevalence among the study population was 6.1%. Only four HCWs refused to have an RST.The 21 qualitative interviews highlighted that HCWs were not afraid of RSTs or of any possible stigma associated with a positive serological status, although they were sometimes suspicious about RST validity. Downplaying their risk of infection was a coping strategy to keep both a sense of control and remain motivated at work. Conclusions: RSTs should be adopted as an additional tool in the strategy to protect both HCWs and healthcare service users. Additional follow-up of these observational findings is needed, especially with the increasing prevalence of vaccination in HCWs.","Mosnier, Emilie; Nevissas, Olivia; Loubière, Sandrine; Mosnier, Marine; Bosetti, Thomas; Bottero, Julie; Roux, Perrine; Monfardini, Elisabetta; Tinland, Aurélie",Public Health Pract (Oxf),102,24

Given prior quality concerns about antibiotic management for children during telemedicine visits outside of primary care, we sought to examine acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) visit volume and antibiotic management for children via telemedicine integrated within pediatric primary care. METHODS: Using electronic health record data from 47 practices within a large pediatric primary care network, we identified visits for ARTI from April to September 2020. For these visits, we categorized antibiotic management consistent with clinical guidelines as guideline concordant. We compared telemedicine and in-person visit guideline-concordant antibiotic management, diagnoses, and antibiotic prescribing using chi-square tests and examined trends over time using descriptive statistics. Antibiotic stewardship during the study period included learning collaborative videoconferences and sharing of clinic and clinician-level metrics through an interactive dashboard. RESULTS: During the 6-month period, 8332 ARTI visits were identified, with 3003 (36%) via telemedicine. Guideline-concordant antibiotic management occurred in 92.5% of telemedicine visits compared to 90.7% of in-person office visits (P = .004). Telemedicine ARTI visits receiving diagnoses of acute otitis media or streptococcal pharyngitis declined from peak of 52% (May) to 7% (September). Guideline-concordant antibiotic management of sinusitis and viral ARTI during telemedicine visits increased from 88% (April) to 97% (September). CONCLUSION: With active antibiotic stewardship, pediatricians practicing within certified medical homes consistently delivered highly guideline-concordant care for ARTIs to their patient population via telemedicine integrated into primary care.","Ray, Kristin N; Martin, Judith M; Wolfson, David; Schweiberger, Kelsey; Schoemer, Pam; Cepullio, Christine; Iagnemma, Jennifer; Hoberman, Alejandro",,102,10

001), and loneliness (r= 26, p&lt; 005) Interestingly, frequency of using remote forms of communication with friends and family outside the home were inversely related to pathological mental health symptoms In other words, those who report frequently keeping in touch with loved ones outside their homes also indicated having lower symptoms of depression (r=- 18, p&lt; 05), anxiety (r=- 18, p&lt; 05), and loneliness (r=- 24, p&lt; 005) Notably, household size was not predictive of the above-mentioned symptoms, but was predictive of stress, such that greater household size was associated with higher levels of stress (r= 21, p&lt; 05) We then separately examined two groups of OAs – those who reported having experienced at least some DSM-5 depressive disorders symptoms in the past 30 days, and those who did not Self-reported magnitude of pandemic-related detriment to social behavior significantly predicted the severity of loneliness, but only in OAs who report some depressive disorder symptoms (r= 24, p&lt; 05) Similarly, in this group, lower perceived social support significantly predicted higher stress (r=- 46, p&lt; 0001) and lower self-reported social contribution predicted higher loneliness (r=- 33, p&lt; 01) respectively Conclusions The preliminary data from our study suggest that greater levels of pandemic-related social isolation are associated with higher severity of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and loneliness Importantly, OAs with depressive symptoms appear to be at risk of adversely being impacted by loss of social support and absence of meaningful outlet for social contributions during prolonged social isolation Conversely, our data suggest utilizing psychosocial interventions designed to shore up social support and greater agency in social contribution may be particularly beneficial to OAs who experience depressive symptoms The correlational nature of our current data is a limitation that will be addressed by our future work gathering responses from the same group of participants who are expected to resume social activity outside the context of pandemic-related social isolation (i e , Wave 2) Our future work will also address how social isolation relates to day-to-day experience and control of emotions, which is a significant dimensional predictor of functional impairment and distress across multiple psychopathologies Funding Funding support from Special Emphasis: Emerging COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 Research seed grant awarded to J Kim, through the Immunology, Inflammation and Infectious Diseases Initiative and the Office of the Vice President for Research at the University of Utah","Kim, Joseph Lee Somi Pfau Nathan Mitamura Madison Jacobson Trace Jeong Gina Germain Jacob Bradford Anna Smith Andrew Koppelmans Vincent",The American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry,102,5

STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Sakarya University Education and Training Hospital, Sakarya, Turkey, between April 1 and 30, 2020. METHODOLOGY: The study included 55 patients who were admitted with diagnosis of COVID-19, and whose illnesses showed a critical course that leads to AKI. The variables were studied as per objective. RESULTS: During the follow-up, 43 out of 55 patients (78.2%) died and 12 (21.8%) were discharged with recovery. The mortality was higher in patients at stage 3 (88.9% mortality) compared to stage 2 (53.8% mortality) (p=0.014). In the nonsurvivor group, RDW (red cell distribution width) and albumin levels were lower at admission; whereas, the LDH levels and CRP/albumin ratios were higher. On regression analysis, low albumin level (OR: 12.793, p = 0.010), high LDH level (OR: 8.454, p = 0.026), and presence of stage 3 AKI (OR: 10.268, p = 0.020) were found as independent risk factors for mortality in COVID-19 patients, who developed AKI. CONCLUSION: In critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, who developed AKI, it was seen that the presence of low albumin, high LDH, and stage 3 AKI at the time of admission could be used as predictors of mortality. Moreover,, it was shown for the first time that in these patients, the high CRP/albumin ratio and low RDW could be associated with mortality.

For informing individuals whether they have had coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), they need to be very accurate. For measuring population prevalence of past infection, the numbers of false positives and negatives need to be roughly equal. With a series of worked examples for a notional population of 100,000 people, we show that even test systems with a high specificity can yield a large number of false positive results, especially where the population prevalence is low. For example, at a true population prevalence of 5%, using a test with 99% sensitivity and specificity, 16% of positive results will be false and thus 950 people will be incorrectly informed they have had the infection. Further confirmatory testing may be needed. Giving false reassurance on which personal or societal decisions might be based could be harmful for individuals, undermine public confidence and foster further outbreaks.","Kumleben, N; Bhopal, R; Czypionka, T; Gruer, L; Kock, R; Stebbing, J; Stigler, F L",Public Health,102,24

From the beginning, Italy (in particular the Northern regions) was the first large European country to be hit and one of the most affected countries worldwide. This had a significant impact on the workload and psychological health of health workers. The aim of this web-based cross-sectional study is to assess the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on Italian doctors' well-being and psychological distress, in respect of demographic and occupational characteristics, lifestyle and habits during the lockdown period. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a web-based cross-sectional survey based on Google® Forms to collect data. The participation was available during the lockdown period that started in Italy on March 9, 2020 and it was voluntary and anonymous. The questionnaire explored demographic and occupational variables, lifestyle and habits during the lockdown, perceived well-being and psychological distress. Multivariate logistic regression models were fitted. RESULTS: Our study reported the very alarming psychological conditions of Italian doctors, especially among those who worked in the most affected regions, where a level of psychological distress of 93.8% and poor well-being of 58.9% were registered. These percentages were even higher in the case of female hospital workers with low job seniority, and those caring for COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reported a significant psychosocial impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on Italian doctors, particularly among those working in the most affected regions of the country. Further studies are necessary to better understand the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on doctors' well-being and mental health over time, in order to implement effective prevention measures.","De Sio, S; Buomprisco, G; La Torre, G; Lapteva, E; Perri, R; Greco, E; Mucci, N; Cedrone, F",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,102,26

In response, many governments denied entry to travellers arriving from various countries affected by the virus. While several industries continue to experience economic losses due to the imposed interventions, it is unclear whether the different travel restrictions were successful in reducing COVID-19 importations. Here we develop a comprehensive framework to model daily COVID-19 importations, considering different travel bans. We quantify the temporal effects of the restrictions and elucidate the relationship between incidence rates in other countries, travel flows and the expected number of importations into the country under investigation. As a cases study, we evaluate the travel bans enforced by the Australian government. We find that international travel bans in Australia lowered COVID-19 importations by 87.68% (83.39 - 91.35) between January and June 2020. The presented framework can further be used to gain insights into how many importations to expect should borders re-open.

Methods: We used the Project for Extension for Community Health Outcomes (ECHO) tele-education model as an implementation strategy. We examined the number of clinicians newly waivered, the number of patients treated with buprenorphine, the relationship between clinician engagement with ECHO training and rates of buprenorphine prescribing, and treatment retention at 180 days. Results: The number of clinicians with a waiver and number of patients treated increased during and after ECHO training. There was a moderate correlation between the number of ECHO sessions attended by a clinician and number of their buprenorphine prescriptions (r = 0.50, p = 0.01). The 180-day retention rate was 80.7%. Conclusions: Project ECHO was highly effective for increasing access to this evidence-based treatment.

Nevertheless, ancient DNA characterization of Formative Period archaeological human remains is particularly scant, especially for Northwest Argentina. To expand current information on genetic characterization of the first agricultural communities of the southern Calchaquí Valleys, we present and discuss the first mitochondrial ancient DNA information obtained on samples dated to ca. 3,600-1,900 years before present from the Cajón Valley, Catamarca Province. Reproducible mtDNA hypervariable region 1 (HVR-1) sequences were obtained in seven individuals. Mitochondrial HVR-1 haplotypes were assigned to three of the four founding haplogroups, D1 (57.1%), C1 (28.5%), and B2 (14.2%), with absence of A2. Our results show that the Cajón Valley sample, with predominance of D1 and C1, differs from that commonly observed in ancient and modern Andean populations, which usually show a high prevalence of haplogroup B2. The fact that the Cajón Valley and Pampa Grande (Salta Province, Argentina) share a prevalence of haplogroup D1 could provide additional evidence to support possible genetic affinities between the valleys and the eastern sub-Andean region during the Formative Period in Northwest Argentina, expanding the archaeological evidence of contact between both populations. Future complete mitogenomic analysis will provide substantial information to formulate new hypotheses about the origins and phylogenetic relationships between the individuals of the Cajón Valley and other groups from the Andes, Gran Chaco, and the Amazon.","Parolin, María Laura; Cortés, Leticia Inés; Basso, Néstor; Scattolin, María Cristina",Hum Biol,102,24

AIM: To determine clinical factors of a poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19 infection. DESIGN AND SETTING: Descriptive, observational, retrospective study in three primary healthcare centres with an assigned population of 100,000. METHOD: Examination of the medical records of patients with COVID-19 infections confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. Logistic multivariate regression models adjusted for age and sex were constructed to analyse independent predictive factors associated with death, ICU admission and hospitalization. RESULTS: We included 322 patients (mean age 56.7 years, 50% female, 115 (35.7%) aged &#8805; 65 years): 123 (38.2) were health workers (doctors, nurses, auxiliaries). Predictors of ICU admission or death were greater age (OR = 1.05; 95%CI = 1.03 to 1.07), male sex (OR = 2.94; 95%CI = 1.55 to 5.82), autoimmune disease (OR = 2.82; 95%CI = 1.00 to 7.84), bilateral pulmonary infiltrates (OR = 2.86; 95%CI = 1.41 to 6.13), elevated lactate-dehydrogenase (OR = 2.85; 95%CI = 1.28 to 6.90), elevated D-dimer (OR = 2.85; 95%CI = 1.22 to 6.98) and elevated C-reactive protein (OR = 2.38; 95%CI = 1.22 to 4.68). Myalgia or arthralgia (OR = 0.31; 95%CI = 0.12 to 0.70) was protective factor against ICU admission and death. Predictors of hospitalization were chills (OR = 5.66; 95%CI = 1.68 to 23.49), fever (OR = 3.33; 95%CI = 1.89 to 5.96), dyspnoea (OR = 2.92; 95%CI = 1.62 to 5.42), depression (OR = 6.06; 95%CI = 1.54 to 40.42), lymphopenia (OR = 3.48; 95%CI = 1.67 to 7.40) and elevated C-reactive protein (OR = 3.27; 95%CI = 1.59 to 7.18). Anosmia (OR = 0.42; 95%CI = 0.19 to 0.90) was the only significant protective factor for hospitalization after adjusting for age and sex.

On short timescales, superspreading events lead to burstiness and overdispersion, whereas long-term persistent heterogeneity in susceptibility is expected to lead to a reduction in both the infection peak and the herd immunity threshold (HIT). Here, we develop a general approach to encompass both timescales, including time variations in individual social activity, and demonstrate how to incorporate them phenomenologically into a wide class of epidemiological models through reparameterization. We derive a nonlinear dependence of the effective reproduction number [Formula: see text] on the susceptible population fraction S. We show that a state of transient collective immunity (TCI) emerges well below the HIT during early, high-paced stages of the epidemic. However, this is a fragile state that wanes over time due to changing levels of social activity, and so the infection peak is not an indication of long-lasting herd immunity: Subsequent waves may emerge due to behavioral changes in the population, driven by, for example, seasonal factors. Transient and long-term levels of heterogeneity are estimated using empirical data from the COVID-19 epidemic and from real-life face-to-face contact networks. These results suggest that the hardest hit areas, such as New York City, have achieved TCI following the first wave of the epidemic, but likely remain below the long-term HIT. Thus, in contrast to some previous claims, these regions can still experience subsequent waves.","Tkachenko, Alexei V; Maslov, Sergei; Elbanna, Ahmed; Wong, George N; Weiner, Zachary J; Goldenfeld, Nigel",Proc.

OBJECTIVES: We estimated the association between patients' characteristics and COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalisation and adverse outcome in Mexico. METHODS: This retrospective case series used a publicly available nation-level dataset released on May 31, 2020 by the Mexican Ministry of Health, with patients classified as suspected cases of viral respiratory disease. Patients with COVID-19 were laboratory-confirmed. Their profile was stratified by COVID-19 diagnosis or not. Differences among COVID-19 patients based on two separate clinical endpoints, hospitalisation and adverse outcome, were examined. Multivariate logistic regressions examined the associations between patient characteristics and hospitalisation and adverse outcome. RESULTS: Overall, 236â439 patients were included, with 89â756 (38.0%) being diagnosed with COVID-19. COVID-19 patients were disproportionately older, males and with increased prevalence of one or more comorbidities, particularly diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. Age, male gender, diabetes, obesity and having one or more comorbidities were independently associated with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Current smokers were 23% less likely to be diagnosed with COVID-19 compared to non-smokers. Of all COVID-19 patients, 34.8% were hospitalised and 13.0% experienced an adverse outcome. Male gender, older age, having one or more comorbidities, and chronic renal disease, diabetes, obesity, COPD, immunosuppression and hypertension were associated with hospitalisation and adverse outcome. Current smoking was not associated with adverse outcome. CONCLUSION: This largest ever case series of COVID-19 patients identified risk factors for COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalisation and adverse outcome.

Preoperative supportive intervention, prehabilitation, has been proven to improve patients' functional status and clinical trajectories. Presently, there is a critical need for prehabilitation to optimize patient health, as they experience extended wait times. However, in-hospital delivery may not be an ideal approach due to public health and safety measures. Telehealth is a field of research and practice, which has grown and evolved significantly in the last two decades, allowing for the remote delivery of health services.

AIM: To investigate the timing of end-of-life recognition, palliative registration, and the recording of end-of-life preferences in primary care for people aged &#8805;75 years. DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective cohort study using national primary care record data, covering 34% of GP practices in England. METHOD: ResearchOne data from electronic healthcare records (EHRs) of people aged &#8805;75 years who died in England between 1 January 2015 and 1 January 2016 were examined. Clinical codes relating to end-of-life recognition, palliative registration, and end-of-life preferences were extracted, and the number of months that elapsed between the code being entered and death taking place were calculated. The timing for each outcome and proportion of relevant EHRs were reported. RESULTS: Death was recorded for a total of 13 149 people in ResearchOne data during the 1-year study window. Of those, 6303 (47.9%) records contained codes suggesting end of life had been recognised at a point in time prior to the month of death. Recognition occurred &#8805;12 months before death in 2248 (17.1%) records. In total, 1659 (12.6%) people were on the palliative care register and 457 (3.5%) were on the register for &#8805;12 months before death; 2987 (22.7%) records had a code for the patient's preferred place of care, and 1713 (13.0%) had a code for the preferred place of death.

F-formation defines social orientations in space where two or more person tends to communicate in a social place. Thus, essentially, we detect F-formations in social gatherings such as meetings, discussions, etc. and predict the robot's approach angle if it wants to join the social group. Additionally, we also detect outliers, i.e., the persons who are not part of the group under consideration. Our proposed pipeline consists of -- a) a skeletal key points estimator (a total of 17) for the detected human in the scene, b) a learning model (using a feature vector based on the skeletal points) using CRF to detect groups of people and outlier person in a scene, and c) a separate learning model using a multi-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict the exact F-formation of the group of people in the current scene and the angle of approach for the viewing robot. The system is evaluated using two data-sets. The results show that the group and outlier detection in a scene using our method establishes an accuracy of 91%. We have made rigorous comparisons of our systems with a state-of-the-art F-formation detection system and found that it outperforms the state-of-the-art by 29% for formation detection and 55% for combined detection of the formation and approach angle.","Barua, Hrishav Bakul; Pramanick, Pradip; Sarkar, Chayan; Mg, Theint Haythi",,102,20

Most of the people in the Indian nation are ordinary people. Many tests for Covid19 are expensive and beyond the reach of the average person. With the advent of the novel Corona Virus, every country now places great importance on health care. So this year, the best solution for such infectious diseases is the IoT-cloud based health monitoring system. The Internet is a newcomer to the field of research, especially in the field of healthcare. With the proliferation of usable sensors and therefore smartphones, this remote health care monitoring has developed at such a pace. IoT health monitoring helps to prevent the spread of the disease and to make an accurate diagnosis of the patient's health condition even if the doctor is far away. In this paper, the portable physiological checking framework will be displayed, which will be able to constantly check the patient's heart rate, temperature, blood oxygen level and blood pressure, as the main symptoms of coronavirus are high fever, fatigue, and difficulty breathing. Sensor data is transferred directly to the IoT cloud using Wi-Fi. Any HTTP and MQTT protocols used in the IoT cloud to provide users with visible and timed sensor data.

As the epidemic grows, prognosis prediction is essential for monitoring risky patient. It is thus important to consider gastrointestinal manifestations and the duration of symptoms as predictors of prognosis. Our aim was to determine the correlation of gastrointestinal symptoms and laboratory markers with disease outcomes and whether symptom duration varies substantially between patients. We also undertook this study to determine the optimal time to predict COVID-19 outcome. Patients and Methods: A total of 190 patients with polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19 were followed up until recovery. We proposed a correlation between gastrointestinal symptoms and disease severity (based on clinical data, and diagnostic investigations) to estimate the duration of symptoms as a predictor of COVID-19 prognosis. Results: The prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms was 49.5%, consisting mainly of diarrhea in 27.9% of patients. In addition, a longer disease duration and higher temperature were observed in patients with diarrhea. Symptom duration was variable, with a median of 12 days and a range of 1-55 days. Statistical analysis indicated that patients with a duration of symptoms &gt;=12 day had more severe symptoms and a worse prognosis. Patients who complained of diarrhea had 2.7 times the odds of a longer duration of symptoms, and those with a history of chronic lung disease have 7.2 times the odds of a longer duration of symptoms. Conclusion: GIT manifestations (mainly diarrhea) and the duration of symptoms of COVID-19 provide prognostic evidence of COVID-19 outcomes, irrespective of earlier categorization by the World Health Organization. Thus, patients with mild symptoms who present with diarrhea and a duration of symptoms longer than 12 days are expected to have a worse prognosis.","Hegazy, M. A.; Lithy, R. M.; Abdel-Hamid, H.

The most sensitive test involves the detection of viral RNA using RT-qPCR (quantitative reverse transcription PCR), with many commercial kits now available for this purpose. However, these are expensive, and supply of such kits in sufficient numbers cannot always be guaranteed. We therefore developed a multiplex assay using well-established SARS-CoV-2 targets alongside a human cellular control (RPP30) and a viral spike-in control (Phocine Herpes Virus 1 [PhHV-1]), which monitor sample quality and nucleic acid extraction efficiency, respectively. Here, we establish that this test performs as well as widely used commercial assays, but at substantially reduced cost. Furthermore, we demonstrate >1,000-fold variability in material routinely collected by combined nose and throat swabbing and establish a statistically significant correlation between the detected level of human and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids. The inclusion of the human control probe in our assay therefore provides a quantitative measure of sample quality that could help reduce false-negative rates. We demonstrate the feasibility of establishing a robust RT-qPCR assay at approximately 10% of the cost of equivalent commercial assays, which could benefit low-resource environments and make high-volume testing affordable.","Reijns, Martin A M; Thompson, Louise; Acosta, Juan Carlos; Black, Holly A; Sanchez-Luque, Francisco J; Diamond, Austin; Parry, David A; Daniels, Alison; O039,; Shea, Marie; Uggenti, Carolina; Sanchez, Maria C; Callaghan, Alan; McNab, Michelle L L; Adamowicz, Martyna; Friman, Elias T; Hurd, Toby; Jarman, Edward J; Chee, Frederic Li Mow; Rainger, Jacqueline K; Walker, Marion; Drake, Camilla; Longman, Dasa; Mordstein, Christine; Warlow, Sophie J; McKay, Stewart; Slater, Louise; Ansari, Morad; Tomlinson, Ian P M; Moore, David; Wilkinson, Nadine; Shepherd, Jill; Templeton, Kate; Johannessen, Ingolfur; Tait-Burkard, Christine; Haas, Jürgen G; Gilbert, Nick; Adams, Ian R; Jackson, Andrew P",PLoS Biol,102,16

Air pollution has been linked to cardiorespiratory-related diseases and even premature mortality. The short-term exposure to air pollution may aggravate pulmonary symptoms in COVID-19 patients. The relationship between the short-term exposure to air pollution and hospital admission and mortality resulting from COVID-19 will be examined in Tehran, Iran, during the spring and summer of 2020. The statistics of PM2.5, PM10, and 8-h maximum ozone (O3) concentrations, meteorological conditions, and COVID-19 hospital admissions/mortality were analyzed. The cross-correlation and temporal relationship between the daily concentration of the aforementioned pollutants (as well as the meteorological conditions) and the COVID-19 hospital admissions/mortality rate was calculated for each month. The concentration of PM2.5, PM10, and 8-h maximum O3, along with temperature, increased in the summer. The hospital admissions and mortality associated with COVID-19 decreased from the first peak in the spring and then increased to its second peak in the summer. The short-term exposure to ambient PM2.5, PM10, O3, and elevated temperatures is associated with higher rates of COVID-19-related hospital admissions/mortality throughout the summer. Among these variables, the correlation with O3 was statistically significant in more summer months. The short-term exposure to air pollution (especially O3) may increase the susceptibility of the population infected with COVID-19 and, therefore, increases the rate of hospital admissions and mortality even during the warm seasons.","Khorsandi, Babak; Farzad, Kiarash; Tahriri, Hannaneh; Maknoon, Reza",Environ Monit Assess,102,29

These plans' implementation was part of the usual logic of post-marketing surveillance of new and innovative health products. It was especially adapted to the context of post-marketing monitoring of drugs developed according to the usual scientific quality standards but in an accelerated schedule. In Europe, the reinforced surveillance system relies on the complementary strengths of pharmacovigilance and pharmacoepidemiology. If the performances of pharmacovigilance monitoring are incomparable for the detection of safety signals relating to rare events of atypical presentation, it needs to be completed with pharmacoepidemiology activities for more common events, either multifactorial or frequently classified as idiopathic. The pharmacoepidemiological monitoring developed in Europe was elaborated before the first SARS-Cov-2 vaccines where marketed, taking into account the lessons learned from the vaccination campaign against 2009 A (H1N1) influenza. It includes numerous academic studies as well as studies performed within vaccines risk management plans. In terms of safety, those defined a priori mostly concerns a list of pre-established health events of specific interest. Aside of these planned activities, ad-hoc studies will be latter developed on purpose to investigate safety signals or potential signals that could be identified as the result of pharmacovigilance activities. Aside of these regulated activities, as for today, very few studies have been published regarding SARS-Cov-2 vaccines; most of the existing consist in preprints that should be considered with caution. Pharmacoepidemiology of vaccines is thought to allow near-real time monitoring that needs sufficient time to provide with valid results. In the constant urge for information that accompanies COVID-related science, it is important not to make haste the enemy of speed and to let pharmacoepidemiology provides with what it is expected to do: rock-solid scientific information contributing to evidence-based decision-making.","Pariente, Antoine; Bezin, Julien",Therapie,102,3

An information note,12.653248,8.849088,2021,"PURPOSE: Thirty-day mortality of patients with hip fracture is well researched and predictive; validated scoring tools have been developed (Nottingham Hip Fracture Score, NHFS). COVID-19 has significantly greater mortality in the elderly and comorbid patients which includes hip fracture patients. Non-operative treatment is not appropriate due to significantly higher mortality, and therefore, these patients are often exposed to COVID-19 in the peri-operative period. What is unclear is the effect of concomitant COVID-19 infection in these patients. METHODS: A multicentre prospective study across ten sites in the United Kingdom (responsible for 7% of hip fracture patients per annum in the UK). Demographic and background information were collected by independent chart review. Data on surgical factors included American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, time to theatre, Nottingham Hip fracture score (NHFS) and classification of fracture were also collected between 1st March 2020 and 30th April 2020 with a matched cohort from the same period in 2019. RESULTS: Actual and expected 30-day mortality was found to be significantly higher than expected for 2020 COVID-19 positive patients (RR 3.00 95% CI 1.57-5.75, p < 0.001), with 30 observed deaths compared against the 10 expected from NHFS risk stratification. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 infection appears to be an independent risk factor for increased mortality in hip fracture patients. Whilst non-operative management of these fractures is not suggested due to the documented increased risks and mortality, this study provides evidence to the emerging literature of the severity of COVID-19 infection in surgical patients and the potential impact of COVID-19 on elective surgical patients in the peri-operative period.","Narang, A; Chan, G; Aframian, A; Ali, Z; Carr, A; Goodier, H; Morgan, C; Park, C; Sugand, K; Walton, T; Wilson, M; Belgaumkar, A; Gallagher, K; Ghosh, K; Gibbons, C; Keightley, A; Nawaz, Z; Wakeling, C; Sarraf, K; Rogers, B A; Kieffer, W K M",Int. orthop,102,14

We report a patient with no respiratory symptoms, presented with abdominal pain and an extensive splenic infarction after COVID-19. Case report: A 67 year-old man was admitted to the emergency department with a moderate, dull, left-sided abdominal pain. The patient denied respiratory symptoms but referred contact with family members positive for COVID-19. He tested positive for COVID-19 and had increased D-dimer levels. Imaging studies revealed splenic infarcts and ground-glass opacities in bilateral pulmonary bases. He was treated with full-dose anticoagulation and was discharged home on oral Rivaroxaban. Discussion: Although rare in the literature, cases of acute abdomen in COVID-19 patients associated with vascular infarctions have increased. Coagulopathy may be present even without clinical respiratory manifestations of the disease. Patients meeting disseminated intravascular coagulation criteria or with markedly elevated D-dimer may benefit from anticoagulant therapy. Conclusion: Clinicians should suspect of abdominal visceral infarctions in COVID-19 patients presented with acute abdominal pain, despite the absence of respiratory symptoms.","Castro, Gustavo Rodrigues Alves; Collaço, Iwan Augusto; Dal Bosco, Caroline L Balcewicz; Corrêa, Gustavo Gusso; Dal Bosco, Giovana Balcewicz; Corrêa, Giovana Luiza",IDCases,102,22

METHODS: From March to May 2020, learners were invited to participate in a monthly 60-minute virtual MEJC. A needs assessment survey informed article selection. Facilitators developed a presentation to provide background and describe the article's research question(s). In breakout groups, learners generated study designs to answer the research question(s). After the actual study methodology and results were revealed, learners engaged in facilitated open discussion. After the session, learners completed an electronic survey to rate perceived usefulness and suggest improvement areas. RESULTS: A total of 15 learners participated; most completed the survey (13/15; 87%). The MEJC was rated as very or extremely useful. Qualitative feedback indicated that it was convenient, allowed creativity, and enabled rich discussion without prior preparation. When possible, improvement suggestions were implemented.

The Kingman coalescent is used in a generative model of molecular sequence variation to infer evolutionary parameters. However, it is well understood that inference under this model does not scale well with sample size. Here, we build on recent work based on a lower resolution coalescent process, the Tajima coalescent, to model longitudinal samples. While the Kingman coalescent models the ancestry of labeled individuals, the heterochronous Tajima coalescent models the ancestry of individuals labeled by their sampling time. We propose a new inference scheme for the reconstruction of effective population size trajectories based on this model with the potential to improve computational efficiency. Modeling of longitudinal samples is necessary for applications (e.g. ancient DNA and RNA from rapidly evolving pathogens like viruses) and statistically desirable (variance reduction and parameter identifiability). We propose an efficient algorithm to calculate the likelihood and employ a Bayesian nonparametric procedure to infer the population size trajectory. We provide a new MCMC sampler to explore the space of heterochronous Tajima's genealogies and model parameters. We compare our procedure with state-of-the-art methodologies in simulations and applications.","Cappello, Lorenzo; Veber, Amandine; Palacios, Julia A.",,102,20

A first analysis of simple day-lag maps points to some universality in the epidemic spreading, suggesting that simple mean-field models can be meaningfully used to gather a quantitative picture of the epidemic spreading, and notably the height and time of the peak of confirmed infected individuals. The analysis of the same data within a simple susceptible-infected-recovered-deaths model indicates that the kinetic parameter that describes the rate of recovery seems to be the same, irrespective of the country, while the infection and death rates appear to be more variable. The model places the peak in Italy around March 21st2020, with a peak number of infected individuals of about 26000 (not including recovered and dead) and a number of deaths at the end of the epidemics of about 18,000. Since the confirmed cases are believed to be between 10 and 20% of the real number of individuals who eventually get infected, the apparent mortality rate of COVID-19 falls between 4% and 8% in Italy, while it appears substantially lower, between 1% and 3% in China. Based on our calculations, we estimate that 2500 ventilation units should represent a fair figure for the peak requirement to be considered by health authorities in Italy for their strategic planning. Finally, a simulation of the effects of drastic containment measures on the outbreak in Italy indicates that a reduction of the infection rate indeed causes a quench of the epidemic peak. However, it is also seen that the infection rate needs to be cut down drastically and quickly to observe an appreciable decrease of the epidemic peak and mortality rate.

Results indicate that everyday discrimination and healthcare discrimination were associated with significantly higher general medical mistrust, and healthcare discrimination and structural discrimination were associated with higher endorsement of health-specific COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs. Higher endorsement of health-specific COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs, but not general medical mistrust, was associated with significantly lower engagement in health-specific COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs.

The Korean government has declared a red alert, which is the highest level of the national infectious disease alert system, and the World Health Organization has similarly declared its highest-level pandemic alert (phase 6). The spread of COVID-19 is an unprecedented worldwide public health problem that governments and individuals must work to overcome. Recently, an infection cluster arose in a call center in Seoul. To support call center companies, the Korean Ministry of Employment and Labor has proposed covering the costs of installing partitions and air purifiers, providing hand sanitizers, and supplying masks to prevent droplet and aerosol infections. Air purifiers are expected to be installed on the floor with the exhaust outlets at a higher level, such as the level of the desks or breathing zones of workers. When a worker coughs or releases droplets near a colleague's respiratory system, the droplets may spread throughout the call center via air flow from air purifier. In this fashion, a single infected person can give rise to an infection cluster. Attempts to prevent infection must not lead to new infections, and the installation of air purifiers may cause new problems. Therefore, using air purifiers to control the spread of COVID-19 should be approached with caution.","Ham, Seunghon",Epidemiol Health,102,32

Subsequently, confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the robustness of the measure by referring to a wide range of goodness-of-fit indices that met the recommended standards. The construct validity of the scale has been proved by its convergent and discriminant validity.The reliability of the instrument examined by means of three internal consistency indices and the corrected item-total correlation demonstrated that the three dimensions of the instrument are reliable: Cronbach's &#945; indices have values of 0.89, 0.88 and 0.88 for the Consumption, Confidence, and Sharing subscales, respectively.The corrected item-total correlation ranged from 0.70 to 0.78.The correlation between the instrument's dimensions with the internet addiction scale and mental health factors showed positive associations. Conclusion:The scale is eligible for measuring the credibility of disinformation and can be adapted to measure the credibility of social media disinformation in other contexts.","Guelmami, Noomen; Ben Khalifa, Maher; Chalghaf, Nasr; Kong, Jude Dzevela; Amayra, Tannoubi; Wu, Jianhong; Azaiez, Fairouz; Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi",,102,16

A substantial part of this variation is due to the presence of transposable elements (TEs). They contribute significantly to a cell's mass of DNA and have the potential to become involved in host gene control. We argue that the suppression of their activities by methylation of the C-phosphate-G (CpG) dinucleotide in DNA is essential for their long-term accommodation in the host genome and, therefore, to its expansion. An inevitable consequence of cytosine methylation is an increase in C-to-T transition mutations via deamination, which causes CpG loss. Cytosine deamination is often needed for TEs to take on regulatory functions in the host genome. Our study of the whole-genome sequences of 53 organisms showed a positive correlation between the size of a genome and the percentage of TEs it contains, as well as a negative correlation between size and the CpG observed/expected (O/E) ratio in both TEs and the host DNA. TEs are seldom found at promoters and transcription start sites, but they are found more at enhancers, particularly after they have accumulated C-to-T and other mutations. Therefore, the methylation of TE DNA allows for genome expansion and also leads to new opportunities for gene control by TE-based regulatory sites.","Zhou, Wanding; Liang, Gangning; Molloy, Peter L; Jones, Peter A",Proc.

METHODS: This single-center, pilot study investigated the effects of a 4-week (eight sessions) virtual AF self-management program. Questionnaires were completed at baseline and 1 week after the intervention, and assessed AF knowledge, adherence to self-management behaviors, mental health, physical function, and disease-specific quality of life in patients with AF. Secondary outcomes included knowledge of COVID-19, intervention, acceptability, and satisfaction. RESULTS: Of 68 patients who completed baseline questionnaires, 57 participated in the intervention and were included in the analysis (mean age of 73.4 ± 10.0 years, 60% male). Adherence to AF self-monitoring behaviors, including monitoring their heart rate (p < .001), heart rhythm (p = .003), and blood pressure (p = .013) were significantly improved at the end of the intervention compared with baseline. Symptom identification (p = .007) and management (p < .001) also improved. Reductions in sleep disturbance (p < .001), anxiety (p = .014), and depression (p = .046) were also observed. Misinformation and inaccurate beliefs about COVID-19 were significantly reduced at the end of the intervention compared with baseline.

SARS-CoV2 virus-like particles (VLPs) offer a BSL-1, replication-incompetent system that can be used to evaluate virus assembly and virus-cell entry processes in tractable cell culture conditions. Here, we describe a SARS-CoV2 VLP system that utilizes nanoluciferase (Nluc) fragment complementation to track assembly and entry. We utilized the system in two ways. Firstly, we investigated the requirements for VLP assembly. VLPs were produced by concomitant synthesis of three viral membrane proteins, spike (S), envelope (E), and matrix (M), along with the cytoplasmic nucleocapsid (N). We discovered that VLP production and secretion were highly dependent on N proteins. N proteins from related betacoronaviruses variably substituted for the homologous SARS-CoV2 N, and chimeric betacoronavirus N proteins effectively supported VLP production if they contained SARS-CoV2 N carboxy-terminal domains (CTD). This established the CTDs as critical features of virus particle assembly. Secondly, we utilized the system by investigating virus-cell entry. VLPs were produced with Nluc peptide fragments appended to E, M, or N proteins, with each subsequently inoculated into target cells expressing complementary Nluc fragments. Complementation into functional Nluc was used to assess virus-cell entry. We discovered that each of the VLPs were effective at monitoring virus-cell entry, to various extents, in ways that depended on host cell susceptibility factors. Overall, we have developed and utilized a VLP system that has proven useful in identifying SARS-CoV2 assembly and entry features.","Kumar, Binod; Hawkins, Grant M; Kicmal, Tom; Qing, Enya; Timm, Emily; Gallagher, Tom",,102,11

Many patients may have sudden clinical worsening and may be already compromised at hospitalisation. We investigated the burden of lung involvement according to the time to hospitalisation. METHODS: In this observational cohort study, 55 consecutive COVID-19-related pneumonia patients were admitted to the Emergency Medicine Unit. Groups of lung involvement at computed tomography were classified as follows: 0 (<5%), 1 (5%-25%), 2 (26%-50%), 3 (51%-75%) and 4 (>75%). We also investigated in-hospital death and the predictive value of Yan-XGBoost model and PREDI-CO scores for death. RESULTS: The median age was 74 years and 34 were men. Time to admission increased from 2 days in group 0 to 8.5-9 days in groups 3 and 4. A progressive increase in LDH, CRP and d-dimer was found across groups, while a decrease of lymphocytes paO2 /FiO2 ratio and SpO2 was found. Ten (18.2%) patients died during the in-hospital staying. Patients who died were older, with a trend to lower lymphocytes, a higher d-dimer, creatine phosphokinase and troponin T. The Yan-XGBoost model did not accurately predict in-hospital death with an AUC of 0.57 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37-0.76), which improved after the addition of the lung involvement groups (AUC 0.68, 95%CI 0.45-0.90). Conversely, a good predictive value was found for the original PREDI-CO score with an AUC of 0.76 (95% CI 0.58-0.93) which remained similar after the addition of the lung involvement (AUC 0.76, 95% CI 0.57-0.94). CONCLUSION: We found that delayed hospital admission is associated with higher lung involvement. Hence, our data suggest that patients at risk for more severe disease, such as those with high LDH, CRP and d-dimer, should be promptly referred to hospital care.","Marino, Luca; Suppa, Marianna; Rosa, Antonello; Servello, Adriana; Coppola, Alessandro; Palladino, Mariangela; Mazzocchitti, Anna Maria; Bresciani, Emanuela; Petramala, Luigi; Bertazzoni, Giuliano; Pastori, Daniele",Int J Clin Pract,102,16

During the high solar activity, emissions of matter and electromagnetic fields from the Sun make it difficult for cosmic rays to penetrate the Earth. When solar energy is high, cosmic ray intensity is lower, so that the solar magnetic field and solar winds affect the Earth externally and originate new viruses. In this paper, we assess the possible effects of sunspot numbers on the world virus appearance. The literature has no sufficient results about these phenomena. Therefore, we try to relate solar ray extremum to virus generation and the history of pandemics. First, wavelet decomposition is used for smoothing the sunspot cycle to predict past pandemics and forecast the future time of possible virus generation. Finally, we investigate the geographical appearance of the virus in the world to show vulnerable places in the world. The result of the analysis of pandemics that occurred from 1750 to 2020 shows that world's great viral pandemics like COVID-19 coincide with the relative extrema of sunspot number. Based on our result, 27 pandemic (from 36) incidences are on sunspot extrema. Then, we forecast future pandemics in the world for about 110 years or 10 cycles using presented multi-step autoregression (MSAR). To confirm these phenomena and the generation of new viruses because of solar activity, researchers should carry out experimental studies.","Nasirpour, Mohammad Hossein; Sharifi, Abbas; Ahmadi, Mohsen; Jafarzadeh Ghoushchi, Saeid",Environ. sci. pollut. res. int.

Severe pediatric COVID-19 disease is rare, limiting potential data accumulation on associated respiratory failure in children. Pediatric intensivists and pulmonologists managing COVID-19 patients look to adult guidelines and pediatric-specific consensus statements to guide management. The purpose of this article is to review the current literature and recommended strategies for the escalation of noninvasive and invasive respiratory support for acute respiratory failure associated with COVID-19 disease in children. RECENT FINDINGS: There are no prospective studies comparing COVID-19 treatment strategies in children. Adult and pediatric ventilation management interim guidance is based on evidence-based guidelines in non-COVID acute respiratory distress syndrome, with considerations of (1) noninvasive positive pressure ventilation versus high-flow nasal cannula and (2) high versus lower positive end expiratory pressure strategies related to lung compliance and potential lung recruitability. SUMMARY: Management of acute respiratory failure from COVID-19 requires individualized titration of noninvasive and invasive ventilation modalities with consideration of preserved or compromised pulmonary compliance. Research regarding best practices in the management of pediatric severe COVID-19 with respiratory failure is lacking and is acutely needed as the pandemic surges and vaccination of the pediatric population will be delayed compared to adults.","Blumenthal, Jennifer A; Duvall, Melody G",Curr Opin Pediatr,102,23

The pandemic period from 1/3/2020 to 31/7/2020 was compared with the same period in 2019. Overall, in 2020 there was a 2.4% reduction in the number of allo-HCT cases compared to 2019. Interestingly, this deflection did not affect the acute leukemia cases (+5.7% in 2020). The use of peripheral blood-derived stem cells (+10.7%) and cryopreservation (97.4% of the centers) was highly adopted in 2020. Despite the sanitary emergency, almost all of the surveyed centers declared no impact of SARS-CoV2 pandemic on the transplant timing and outcomes, and the sanitary policy was positively evaluated by the majority of centers. The emergency measures ensured that only a minority of the allo-HCT patients had been infected by SARS-CoV2; however, a mortality of 42.1% among the allo-HCT patients hospitalized for COVID-19 was recorded. This survey gives us the information that the GITMO Group reacted positively to the pandemic. Thanks to the emergency strategies, the Italian allo-HCT activity continued safely, showing only a minor deflection and offering the same probability of cure to the transplanted patients.","Russo, Domenico; Polverelli, Nicola; Malagola, Michele; Farina, Mirko; Leoni, Alessandro; Bernardi, Simona; Mammoliti, Sonia; Sacchi, Nicoletta; Martino, Massimo; Ciceri, Fabio",Bone marrow transplant,102,15

This article reviews advances in the use of artificial intelligence for the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of urinary stone disease over the last 2 years. Pertinent studies were identified via a nonsystematic review of the literature performed using MEDLINE and the Cochrane database. RECENT FINDINGS: Twelve articles have been published, which met the inclusion criteria. This included three articles in the detection and diagnosis of stones, six in the prediction of postprocedural outcomes including percutaneous nephrolithotomy and shock wave lithotripsy, and three in the use of artificial intelligence in prevention of stone disease by predicting patients at risk of stones, detecting the stone type via digital photographs and detecting risk factors in patients most at risk of not attending outpatient appointments. SUMMARY: Our knowledge of artificial intelligence in urology has greatly advanced in the last 2 years. Its role currently is to aid the endourologist as opposed to replacing them. However, the ability of artificial intelligence to efficiently process vast quantities of data, in combination with the shift towards electronic patient records provides increasingly more 'big data' sets. This will allow artificial intelligence to analyse and detect novel diagnostic and treatment patterns in the future.","Yang, Bob; Veneziano, Domenico; Somani, Bhaskar K",Curr Opin Urol,102,26

A sample of 235 subjects (73.2% girls;ages 12–18 years, M = 16.08, SD = 1.7) was involved. Participants were asked to complete part of the MADRE Questionnaire, as well as to report their Most Recent Dream by responding to specific questions related to this dream content (e.g., positive vs. negative emotions, realism/bizarreness, and presence of sensory impressions). Results indicated that participants most strongly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic reported the strongest effects on their dreams, as well as longest dreams. Results also indicated that girls recall dreams more often than boys, in addition to reporting higher emotional intensity, predominantly negative emotions, and more nightmares, including recurrent ones. Finally, the most recent dreams were set in both indoor and outdoor settings, with many family members and friends present. They were marked by strong negative emotions, especially related to dangerous, violent, and frustrating situations. In sum, the findings of this study indicate that the method of quali-quantitative dream content analysis is a very informative approach for studying the effects of significant contextual and catastrophic events on people’s inner lives. © 2021.

Here we report changes from 2013 to 2018 in PrEP and postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) awareness and use among HIV-negative gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) and assess predictors of PrEP initiation. METHODS: In the prospective cohort study Attitudes to, and Understanding of Risk of Acquisition of HIV 2 (AURAH2), MSM were recruited from three sexual health clinics in England: two in London and one in Brighton, UK. Men were eligible if they were aged 18 years or older and HIV-negative or of unknown HIV status. Participants self-completed a baseline paper questionnaire at one of the three clinics between July 30, 2013, and April 30, 2016, and were subsequently able to complete 4-monthly and annual online questionnaires, which were available between March 1, 2015, and March 31, 2018, and collected information on sociodemographics, health and wellbeing, HIV status, and sexual behaviours. PrEP and PEP use in the previous 12 months was obtained at baseline and in annual questionnaires. We assessed trends over calendar time in 3-month periods from first enrolment to the end of the study period (July-December, 2013, was counted as one period) in use of PrEP and PEP using generalised estimating equation logistic models. We used age-adjusted Poisson models to assess factors associated with PrEP initiation among participants who reported never having used PrEP at baseline. FINDINGS: 1162 men completed a baseline questionnaire, among whom the mean age was 34 years (SD 10·4), and of those with available data, 942 (82%) of 1150 were white, 1076 (94%) of 1150 were gay, and 857 (74%) of 1159 were university educated. 622 (54%) of 1162 men completed at least one follow-up online questionnaire, of whom 483 (78%) completed at least one annual questionnaire. Overall, PrEP use in the past year increased from 0% (none of 28 respondents) in July to December, 2013, to 43% (23 of 53) in January to March, 2018. The corresponding increase in PrEP use among men who reported condomless sex with two or more partners was from 0% (none of 13 respondents) to 78% (21 of 27). PEP use peaked in April to June, 2016, at 28% (41 of 147 respondents), but decreased thereafter to 8% (four of 53) in January to March, 2018. Among 460 men who had never used PrEP at baseline, predictors of initiating PrEP included age 40-44 years (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 4·25, 95% CI 1·14-15·79) and 45 years and older (3·59, 1·08-11·97) versus younger than 25 years; and after adjustment for age, recent HIV test (5·17, 1·89-14·08), condomless sex (5·01, 2·16-11·63), condomless sex with two or more partners (5·43, 2·99-9·86), group sex (1·69, 1·01-2·84), and non-injection chemsex-related drugs use (2·86, 1·67-4·91) in the past 3 months, PEP use (4·69, 2·83-7·79) in the past 12 months, and calendar year (Jan 1, 2017, to March 31, 2018 vs July 30, 2013, to Dec 31, 2015: 21·19, 9·48-47·35). Non-employment (0·35, 0·14-0·91) and unstable or no housing (vs homeowner 0·13, 0·02-0·95) were associated with reduced rates of PrEP initiation after adjustment for age. About half of PrEP was obtained via the internet, even after the PrEP Impact trial had started (11 [48%] of 23 respondents in January to March, 2018). INTERPRETATION: PrEP awareness and use increased substantially from 2013 to 2018 among a cohort of MSM in England. Improving access to PrEP by routine commissioning by National Health Service England could increase PrEP use among all eligible MSM, but should include public health strategies to target socioeconomic and demographic disparities in knowledge and use of PrEP.

Vitamin D has emerged as a potential treatment able to reduce the disease severity. OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the effect of calcifediol [25OHD3] treatment on COVID-19-related outcomes. DESIGN: Observational cohort study from March to May, 2020. SETTING: Patients admitted to COVID-19 wards of Hospital del Mar, Barcelona, Spain. PATIENTS: A total of 930 patients with COVID-19 were included. Ninety-two were excluded due to previous calcifediol intake. INTERVENTION: Of the remaining 838, a total of 447 received calcifediol (532ug on day one plus 266ug on day 3, 7, 15, and 30) whereas 391 were not treated at the time of hospital admission (Intention-to-Treat). Of the latter, 53 patients were treated later during ICU admission and were allocated in the treated group in a second analysis. In healthy subjects, calcifediol is about 3.2-fold more potent on a weight basis than cholecalciferol. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: ICU admission and mortality. RESULTS: ICU assistance was required by 102 (12.2%) participants. Out of 447 patients treated with calcifediol at admission, 20 (4.5%) required ICU, compared to 82 (21%) out of 391 non-treated (p-value<0.0001). Logistic regression of calcifediol treatment on ICU admission, adjusted by age, gender, linearized 25OHD levels at baseline, and comorbidities showed that treated patients had a reduced risk to require ICU (OR 0.13 [95% CI 0.07;0.23]). Overall mortality was 10%. In the Intention-to-Treat analysis, 21 (4.7%) out of 447 patients treated with calcifediol at admission died compared to 62 patients (15.9%) out of 391 non-treated (p=0.0001). Adjusted results showed a reduced mortality risk with an OR 0.21 [95% CI 0.10; 0.43]). In the second analysis, the obtained OR was 0.52 [95% CI 0.27;0.99].

Between November 13 and 18, Rt was reduced by 14.71% (95% credible interval, CrI, [14.41%, 14.99%]) in North Dakota following a mask mandate; Idaho saw a 1.93% (95% CrI [1.87%, 1.99%]) reduction and Montana saw a 9.63% (95% CrI [9.26%, 9.98%]) reduction following the tightening of restrictions. High-population counties had higher per-capita cumulative case-count in North Dakota at four time points (June 30, August 31, October 31, and December 31, 2020). In Idaho, North Dakota, and South Dakota, there was a positive correlation between population size and per-capita weekly incident case-count, adjusted for calendar time and social vulnerability index variables. ConclusionsRt decreased after mask mandate during the regions case-count spike suggested reduction in SARS-CoV-2 transmission.","Hua, Xinyi; Kehoe, Aubrey R.

Neuroimaging studies showed that (complex) circular dynamic GPs mainly activate areas along both the ventral and the dorsal stream such as hMT+, V3b/KO, dorsal V4 and LOC, whereas directional motion from rotating random dot kinematograms (RDKs) mainly activates the human MT complex (hMT+) and area V6. However, despite the large number of correlational information from fMRI studies, there is scarce evidence about the causal involvement of these brain areas in the perception of dynamic circular GPs and rotating RDKs. The aim of this study is to compare the neural basis of dynamic circular GPs and rotating RDKs by temporarily interfering with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) delivered over two visual areas largely involved in form and motion processing, such as V1/V2 and hMT+. Our results showed that rTMS over hMT+ interfered only with the processing of rotating RDKs but not with the processing of circular dynamic GPs. On the other hand, rTMS delivered over early visual areas (V1/V2) did not interfere with the processing of both visual stimuli. These results suggest that partially different neural substrates subtend the processing of circular directional motion and apparent non-directional motion.","Donato, Rita; Pavan, Andrea; Nucci, Massimo; Campana, Gianluca",Neuropsychologia,102,20

METHODS: The ACEI cohort comprised 22,384 patients aged &#8805; 18 years with a first prescription of ACEI. The comparison angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) cohort consisted of age-, sex- and comorbidity-matched patients at a ratio of 1:1. The primary outcome was the incidence of lung cancer, which was evaluated using a proportional hazard model. RESULTS: The overall incidence rates of lung cancer in the ACEI and ARB cohorts were 16.6 and 12.2 per 10,000 person-years, respectively. The ACEI cohort had a significantly higher risk of lung cancer than the ARB cohort (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]. = 1.36; 95% confidence interval [CI]. = 1.11-1.67). Duration-response and dose-response analyses revealed that compared with patients who did not receive ACEIs, patients who received ACEIs for more than 45 days per year (aHR = 1.87; 95% CI = 1.48-2.36) and patients who received more than 540 defined daily doses of ACEIs per year (aHR =1.80; 95% CI = 1.43--2.27) had a significantly higher risk of lung cancer. The cumulative incidence of lung cancer was also significantly higher in the ACEI cohort than in the ARB cohort (log-rank test, p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: ACEI use is associated with an increased risk of lung cancer compared with ARB use. Patients using ARBs have a significantly lower risk of lung cancer than non-ARB users.","Lin, Shih-Yi; Lin, Cheng-Li; Lin, Cheng-Chieh; Hsu, Wu-Huei; Lin, Chia-Der; Wang, I-Kuan; Hsu, Chung-Y; Kao, Chia-Hung",,102,24

We here describe our experiences during the treatment of COVID-19 patients (n = 42) treated from 2 March 2020 to 16 April 2020 at a German district hospital. Forty-two COVID-19 patients were hospitalized and five patients developed a severe disease, requiring intensive care. Overall, 11 out of 42 hospitalized patients died. COVID-19 caused lymphocytopenia, as well as increased d-dimer, c-reactive protein and creatine kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase levels. These changes were mostly pronounced in patients that developed a severe disease course. Radiologic findings included ground-glass opacity, bilateral/multilobular involvement, consolidation, and posterior involvement. We compared COVID-19 patients to an average population of ‘non-COVID’ patients. Interestingly, no laboratory or radiologic finding was specific for COVID-19 when standing alone, as comorbidities of ‘non-COVID’ patients certainly can mimic similar results. In common praxis, the diagnosis of COVID-19 is based on a positive PCR result. However, a false-negative result causes problems for the workflow of an entire hospital. In our clinic, the consequences of a false assumption of SARS-CoV-2 negativity in four cases had dramatic consequences, as contact persons had to be quarantined. To avoid this, a comprehensive view of lab-results, radiology, clinical symptoms and comorbidities is necessary for the correct diagnosis or exclusion of COVID-19.","Schiller, Martin; Fisahn, Juergen; Huebner, Ute; Hofmann, Patrick; Walther, Joerg; Riess, Susann; Grimm, Christiane; Schwab, Hansjörg; Kick, Wolfgang",J.

The potential of becoming infected can be reduced by a systematic and integrated approach that assesses infection risk. The latter leads to an acceptable choice of materials and techniques for personal protection and prevention of cross-contamination to other patients and staff. The authors have presented a protocolized approach that uses diagnostic criteria to clearly define benchmarks from the medical history along with clinical symptoms and laboratory tests. Patients can then be rapidly assigned into 1 of 3 risk categories that direct the choice of protective materials and/or techniques. Each hospital can adapt this approach to develop a system that fits its individual resources.

The results show evidence for the eigth following groups: (i) SARS-CoV related coronaviruses (SCoVrC including many bat viruses from China), (ii) SARS-CoV-2 related coronaviruses (SCoV2rC; including five bat viruses from Cambodia, Thailand and Yunnan), (iii) pangolin viruses, (iv) three bat viruses showing evidence of recombination between SCoVrC and SCoV2rC genomes, (v) two highly divergent bat viruses from Yunnan, (vi) the bat virus from Japan, (vii) the bat virus from Bulgaria, and (viii) the bat virus from Kenya. All these groups can be diagnosed by specific nucleotide compositional features except the one concerned by recombination between SCoVrC and SCoV2rC. In particular, SCoV2rC genomes are characterised by the lowest percentages of cyosine and highest percentages of uracil at third codon-positions, whereas the genomes of pangolin viruses exhibit the highest percentages of adenine at third codon-positions. I suggest that latitudinal and taxonomic differences in the imbalanced nucleotide pools available in host cells during viral replication can explain the seven groups of SNC here detected among Sarbecovirus genomes. A related effect due to hibernating bats is also considered. I conclude that the two independent host switches from Rhinolophus bats to pangolins resulted in convergent mutational constraints and that SARS-CoV-2 emerged directly from a horseshoe bat virus.","HASSANIN, Alexandre",,102,16

The circumstance demanded online classes as the alternative strategy for continuation of education. Objective To assess current practice and perception about online education among faculties of dental colleges in Nepal. Method A cross-sectional study was conducted among 208 faculties of all dental colleges in Nepal. Data collection was done through structured online questionnaire comprising demographic information, practice and perception of the respondents towards online education. Descriptive statistics surveyed the frequency distribution and Chisquare test assessed the difference in perception among the faculties of different universities. Result The response rate was 74.3%. Faculties commonly used PowerPoint presentation (96.6%) on Zoom platform (83.3%) using laptop (94.7%) with Wi-Fi connection (91.8%). Majority of faculties had good or satisfactory access to internet (94.8%). The faculties believed that the online class environment was interactive (95.2%); but it was not effective (86.5%) as live classroom. Majority of the faculties (79.4%) felt tracking of students' presence was difficult. There was no significant difference on perception towards online class among the faculties of Kathmandu University, Tribhuvan University and BP Koirala Institute Health Sciences at p < 0.05. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic has paved the way for e-learning in dental education in Nepal. Faculties agree to complete the theory syllabus and conduct sessional exams as an alternative during the lockdown period. However, they show strong reservations in carrying out practical/clinical simulations and university exams online. Training on e-learning and institutional strategy for online education is recommended.","Shrestha, R M; Shrestha, S; Acharya, A; Gupta, A",Kathmandu Univ Med J (KUMJ),102,26

Since specific antiviral treatments have not been developed yet and its fatal rate is almost high, early and fast detection is critical for controlling the outbreak. In this study, a piezoelectric microcantilever biosensor has been designed for detecting COVID-19 samples directly without requiring preparation steps. The biosensor acts as a transducer and is coated with the related antibody. When the SARS-CoV-2 antigens adsorbed on the microcantilever top surface through their spike proteins, a surface stress due to the mass change would be prompted leading to the measurable tip deflection and floating voltage. To obtain a biosensor with optimum parameters, different shapes and piezoelectric materials have been assessed and it was concluded that a Poly (vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) biosensor in a shape of a holed punched form triangle, represented the best result. Therefore, the highly sensitive microcantilever biosensor can detect COVID-19 in clinical samples with various viral loads, rapidly. Also, it is selective enough to differentiate SARS-CoV-2 from other viruses with similar symptoms.","Kabir, Hannaneh; Merati, Mohsen; Abdekhodaie, Mohammad J",J Med Eng Technol,102,26

In this work, we quantify age-specific probabilities of transitions between stages defining the natural history of SARS-CoV-2 infection from 1,965 SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals identified in Italy between March and April 2020 among contacts of confirmed cases. Infected contacts of cases were confirmed via RT-PCR tests as part of contact tracing activities or retrospectively via IgG serological tests and followed-up for symptoms and clinical outcomes. In addition, we provide estimates of time intervals between key events defining the clinical progression of cases as obtained from a larger sample, consisting of 95,371 infections ascertained between February and July 2020. We found that being older than 60 years of age was associated with a 39.9% (95%CI: 36.2-43.6%) likelihood of developing respiratory symptoms or fever>= 37.5 {\deg}C after SARS-CoV-2 infection; the 22.3% (95%CI: 19.3-25.6%) of the infections in this age group required hospital care and the 1% (95%CI: 0.4-2.1%) were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU).

However, outside of the short sniffing bouts, a more stable ~ 2 Hz RR was recently shown to rhythmically modulate non-olfactory cognitive processes, as well. The underlying RR coupling with wide-spread forebrain activity was confirmed using advanced techniques, creating solid premise for investigating how higher networks use this mechanism in their communication. Here we show essential differences in the way prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HC) process the RR signal from the olfactory bulb (OB) that may support dynamic, flexible PFC-HC coupling utilizing this input. We used inter-regional coherences and their correlations in rats, breathing at low rate (~ 2 Hz), outside of the short sniffing bouts. We found strong and stable OB-PFC coherence in wake states, contrasting OB-HC coherence which was low but highly variable. Importantly, this variability was essential for establishing PFC-HC synchrony at RR, whereas variations of RRO in OB and PFC had no significant effect. The findings help to understand the mechanism of rhythmic modulation of non-olfactory cognitive processes by the on-going regular respiration, reported in rodents as well as humans. These mechanisms may be impaired when nasal breathing is limited or in OB-pathology, including malfunctions of the olfactory epithelium due to infections, such as in Covid-19.","Mofleh, Rola; Kocsis, Bernat",Sci Rep,102,1

This study explored these variables as potential mortality predictors. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted by searching the MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science databases of studies available through July 27, 2020. The pooled risk was estimated with the odds ratio (p-OR) or effect size (p-ES) obtained through random-effects meta-analyses. Subgroup analyses and meta-regression were applied to explore differences by age, sex and health conditions. The MOOSE guidelines were strictly followed. RESULTS: The meta-analysis included 60 studies, with a total of 51,225 patients (12,458 [24.3%] deaths) from hospitals in 13 countries. A higher in-hospital mortality risk was found for dyspnoea (p-OR = 2.5), smoking (p-OR = 1.6) and several comorbidities (p-OR range: 1.8 to 4.7) and laboratory parameters (p-ES range: 0.3 to -2.6). Age was the main source of heterogeneity, followed by sex and health condition. The following predictors were more markedly associated with mortality in studies with patients with a mean age &#8804;60 years: dyspnoea (p-OR = 4.3), smoking (p-OR = 2.8), kidney disease (p-OR = 3.8), hypertension (p-OR = 3.7), malignancy (p-OR = 3.7), diabetes (p-OR = 3.2), pulmonary disease (p-OR = 3.1), decreased platelet count (p-ES = -1.7), decreased haemoglobin concentration (p-ES = -0.6), increased creatinine (p-ES = 2.4), increased interleukin-6 (p-ES = 2.4) and increased cardiac troponin I (p-ES = 0.7). On the other hand, in addition to comorbidities, the most important mortality predictors in studies with older patients were albumin (p-ES = -3.1), total bilirubin (p-ES = 0.7), AST (p-ES = 1.8), ALT (p-ES = 0.4), urea nitrogen (p-ES), C-reactive protein (p-ES = 2.7), LDH (p-ES = 2.4) and ferritin (p-ES = 1.7). Obesity was associated with increased mortality only in studies with fewer chronic or critical patients (p-OR = 1.8). CONCLUSION: The prognostic effect of clinical conditions on COVID-19 mortality vary substantially according to the mean age of patients.

Through a review of the literature on algorithms and an analysis of Articles 6, IX and 20 of the Brazilian Federal Law n° 13.709/2018 (LGPD) this article concludes that claims that algorithmic decisions are unlawful because of profiling or because they replace human analysis are imprecise and could be better framed. Profiles are nothing more than generalizations, largely accepted in legal systems, and there are many kinds of decisions based on generalizations which algorithms can adequately make with no human intervention. In this context, this article aims at restating the debate about automated decisions and fundamental rights focusing on two main obstacles: (i) the potential for discrimination by algorithmic systems and (ii) accountability of their decision-making processes.

We evaluated whether the rate of severe presentations of new onset type 1 diabetes (DM1), such as, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) has changed since the COVID-19 public health measures were enacted. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review of children less than 18 years of age presenting with new onset DM1 during the pandemic period of March 17, 2020 to August 31, 2020 was conducted at two tertiary care pediatric hospitals in Alberta, Canada. Rates of DKA and severe DKA were compared to the same time period in the year 2019 (pre-pandemic control). RESULTS: The number of children presenting with newly diagnosed DM1 was similar during the pandemic year of 2020 compared with 2019 (107 children in 2020 vs. 114 in 2019). The frequency of DKA at DM1 onset was significantly higher in the pandemic period (68.2% vs 45.6%; p < 0.001) and incidence of severe DKA was also higher (27.1% in 2020 vs 13.2% in 2019; p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant increase in DKA and severe DKA in children presenting with new onset DM1 during the COVID-19 pandemic period. This emphasizes the need for educating health care professionals and families to be aware of the symptoms of hyperglycemia and the importance of early diagnosis and treatment even during public health measures for COVID-19.","Ho, Josephine; Rosolowsky, Elizabeth; Pacaud, Daniele; Huang, Carol; Lemay, Julie-Anne; Brockman, Nicole; Rath, Mitchell; Doulla, Manpreet",Pediatr Diabetes,102,20

The sudden draconian measures changed the delivery of dental education and practice throughout the country. The study aimed to screen for depression during the COVID-19 lockdown and the factors associated with it among dental students and practitioners in highly COVID-19 infected states of India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The current study is an online cross-sectional survey performed in Delhi NCR, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu during May 2020. The participants were recruited by convenience sampling. The main outcome measure was the screening of depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), which was categorized as mild, moderate, and severe depression. The data analysis was performed with IBM SPSS Version 23.0. A multivariable logistic regression model was fitted to identify the independent predictors of depression. RESULTS: In total, 335 dental students and practitioners participated in the survey. Among this, a significant number of the dental students (54%) and practitioners (44%) scored moderate to severe depression in terms of depression severity according to the PHQ-9 scores. Those who were screened depressed were likely to be males and younger than 30 years old. The results of correlation analysis indicated that worry about the professional growth, concerns regarding setbacks in clinical and research experiences, previous history of mental health issues, and fear of contracting COVID-19 from patients were positively related to higher depression scores in students. Moreover, for practitioners, fear of contracting COVID-19 from the patients scored higher levels of depression. The practitioners who reported less concern about their practice/job post COVID-19 lockdown and those who were able to meet their financial expenses during the lockdown were the least likely to be depressed. CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate a high level of depression among a significant number of dental students and practitioners. It is important to monitor and address the mental health needs of dental students and practitioners during and after the lockdown.","Chakraborty, Trishnika; Subbiah, Gireesh Kumar; Damade, Yogesh",European journal of dentistry,102,26

Magnesium plays a critical role in vitamin D biosynthesis and metabolism; and deficiencies in magnesium and vitamin D show associations with poor cognition. However, no study has examined their interaction. This study aimed to evaluate the associations of magnesium intake and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations, indicating vitamin D status, with cognition, and interaction between these nutrients in older adults. METHODS: Based on the National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES) 2011-2014, the study included 2466 participants aged &#8805; 60 years who completed the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) and had data available on serum 25(OH)D and magnesium intake. Cognitive impairment was defined as a DSST score lower than the lowest quartile. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were measured by HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Higher total magnesium intake was independently associated with higher DSST scores (highest quartile vs lowest: ß = 4.34, 95% CI 1.14-7.54). The association of total magnesium intake with high DSST score was primarily observed among women, non-Hispanic whites, physically active participants and those with sufficient vitamin D status, although the interactions were not significant. The odds of cognitive impairment was reduced with increasing intake of total magnesium (p trend < 0.01) and higher level of serum 25(OH)D (p trend = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that high magnesium intake alone may improve cognitive function in older adults, and the association may be stronger among subjects with sufficient vitamin D status. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.","Peeri, Noah C; Egan, Kathleen M; Chai, Weiwen; Tao, Meng-Hua",Eur. j. nutr,102,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS: An ad hoc self-administered anonymous questionnaire was submitted to Italian dentists. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Differences in rates were calculated using the chi-square test. The level of significance was set at p < 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 849 dentists fully completed the survey. Eighty-eight per cent of Italian dentists are worried about the health of their families, with no difference in high-risk (red zone) and low-risk (orange zone) regions. About 86% of professionals report some income loss and 94% fear a drop in patients after the quarantine phase, with the dentists working the red zone claiming a greater economic loss and fearing a reduced practice after the end of the lockdown. DISCUSSION: A large majority of the Italian dentists appears to be aware of the need for changes in their dental practices by planning specific sterilization processes between appointments, testing patients for SARS-CoV-2 serology, asking patients not to be accompanied, and reducing the number of visits per day.

Approximately 3.2% of patients with COVID-19 required intubation and invasive ventilation at some point in the disease course. Providing best practices regarding intubation and ventilation for an overwhelming number of patients with COVID-19 amid an enhanced risk of cross-infection is a daunting undertaking. The authors presented the experience of caring for the critically ill patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan. It is extremely important to follow strict self-protection precautions. Timely, but not premature, intubation is crucial to counter a progressively enlarging oxygen debt despite high-flow oxygen therapy and bilevel positive airway pressure ventilation. Thorough preparation, satisfactory preoxygenation, modified rapid sequence induction, and rapid intubation using a video laryngoscope are widely used intubation strategies in Wuhan. Lung-protective ventilation, prone position ventilation, and adequate sedation and analgesia are essential components of ventilation management.","Meng, Lingzhong; Qiu, Haibo; Wan, Li; Ai, Yuhang; Xue, Zhanggang; Guo, Qulian; Deshpande, Ranjit; Zhang, Lina; Meng, Jie; Tong, Chuanyao; Liu, Hong; Xiong, Lize",Anesthesiology,102,25

Objective: The aim of this study was to determine knowledge, awareness and preparedness regarding coronavirus disease 2019 among CPPs working in Kathmandu, Nepal. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted using a convenience sampling method from 10 February to 25 March 2020. Data were analysed descriptively, and one-sample independent t-test and one-way analysis of variance were used to compare scores among different subgroups of respondents (p < 0.05). Post hoc analyses (following analysis of variance) were done using the Bonferroni test. Results: A total of 81 CPPs participated. Mean ± standard deviation age was 26.70 ± 5.29 years. Majority of the respondents were male (64.2%). Many CPPs (40.7%) had work experience between 1 and 5 years. Almost half (45.7%) had an educational qualification of Diploma in Pharmacy. Significant differences in knowledge (p = 0.022) and preparedness (p < 0.001) were found among individuals with differing levels of work experience. Similarly, a significant difference was found between knowledge-preparedness and work experience (p = 0.022 and p < 0.001), location of pharmacy (p < 0.001) and educational qualification (p = 0.031). Awareness (p < 0.001) and preparedness scores (p = 0.049) were different among community pharmacies with the different number of medicines available. Conclusion: Knowledge was found to be higher in CPPs with a work experience of more than 5 years. CPPs working at larger community pharmacies were more aware and prepared. CPPs' knowledge, awareness and preparedness should be evaluated more widely and strengthened.","Shrestha, Sunil; Jha, Nisha; Palaian, Subish; Shankar, Pathyil Ravi",SAGE Open Med,102,16

METHODS: A case series of critically ill adult men and non-pregnant women, &#8805;18 years of age, with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, was studied at the Royal Hospital, Oman, from April 17 to May 11, 2020. Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) was performed on patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with confirmed or imminent acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or severe pneumonia. The analysis was performed using univariate statistics. RESULTS: A total of 31 COVID-19 patients were included with an overall mean age of 51±15 years (range: 27-76 years); 90% (n=28) were males, and 35% (n=11) of the patients had TPE as a mode of treatment. The TPE group was associated with higher extubation rates than the non-TPE cohort (73% versus 20%; p=0.018). Additionally, patients on TPE had a lower 14 days (0 versus 35%; p=0.033) and 28 days (0 versus 35%; p=0.033) post plasma exchange mortality compared to patients not on TPE. However, all-cause mortality was only marginally lower in the TPE group compared to the non-TPE group (9.1% versus 45%; p=0.055; power=66%). Laboratory and ventilatory parameters also improved post TPE (n = 11). CONCLUSIONS: The use of TPE in severe COVID-19 patients has been associated with improved outcomes, however, randomized controlled clinical trials are warranted to draw final, conclusive findings.","Khamis, Faryal; Al-Zakwani, Ibrahim; Al Hashmi, Sabria; Al Dowaiki, Samata; Al Bahrani, Maher; Pandak, Nenad; Al Khalili, Huda; Memish, Ziad",Int J Infect Dis,102,16

A total of 281 older patients with severe COVID-19 were categorized into two age groups (60-79 years and &#8805; 80 years). Epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory data, and outcome were obtained. Patients aged &#8805; 80 years had higher mortality (63.6%) than those aged 60-79 years (33.5%). Anorexia and comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes and COPD, higher levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), osmotic pressure, C-reactive protein, D-dimer, high-sensitivity troponin I and procalcitonin, and higher SOFA scores were more common in patients aged > 80 years than those aged 60-79 years and also more common and higher in non-survivors than survivors. LDH, osmotic pressure, C-reactive protein, D-dimer, high-sensitivity troponin I, and procalcitonin were positively correlated with age and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA), whereas CD8+ and lymphocyte counts were negatively correlated with age and SOFA. Anorexia, comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), LDH, osmotic pressure, and SOFA were significantly associated with 28-day all-cause mortality. LDH, osmotic pressure and SOFA were valuable for predicting 28-day all-cause mortality, whereas the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of LDH was the largest, with sensitivity of 86.0% and specificity of 80.8%. Therefore, patients with severe COVID-19 aged &#8805; 80 years had worse condition and higher mortality than did those aged 60-79 years, and anorexia and comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, COPD, elevated plasma osmotic pressure, LDH, and high SOFA were independent risk factors associated with 28-day all-cause mortality in older patients with severe COVID-19. LDH may have the highest predictive value for 28-day all-cause mortality in all examined factors.","Jiang, Yi; Abudurexiti, Subi; An, Meng-Meng; Cao, Da; Wei, Jie; Gong, Ping",Sci Rep,102,29

The current COVID-19 pandemic poses a challenge to nursing staff, who are in a key position to provide high-quality palliative care for people with dementia and their families. OBJECTIVE: To formulate practice recommendations for nursing staff with regard to providing palliative dementia care in times of COVID-19. DESIGN AND METHOD: A rapid scoping review following guidelines from the Joanna Briggs Institute. Eligible papers focused on COVID-19 in combination with palliative care for older people or people with dementia and informed practical nursing recommendations for long-term care facilities. After data extraction, we formulated recommendations covering essential domains in palliative care adapted from the National Consensus Project's Clinical Practice Guidelines for Quality Palliative Care. DATA SOURCES: We searched the bibliographic databases of PubMed, CINAHL and PsycINFO for academic publications. We searched for grey literature using the search engine Google. Moreover, we included relevant letters and editorials, guidelines, web articles and policy papers published by knowledge and professional institutes or associations in dementia and palliative care. RESULTS: In total, 23 documents (7 (special) articles in peer-reviewed journals, 6 guides, 4 letters to editors, 2 web articles (blogs), 2 reports, a correspondence paper and a position paper) were included. The highest number of papers informed recommendations under the domains 'advance care planning' and 'psychological aspects of care'. The lowest number of papers informed the domains 'ethical care', 'care of the dying', 'spiritual care' and 'bereavement care'. We found no papers that informed the 'cultural aspects of care' domain. CONCLUSION: Literature that focuses specifically on palliative care for people with dementia in long-term care facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic is still largely lacking. Particular challenges that need addressing involve care of the dying and the bereaved, and ethical, cultural and spiritual aspects of care. Moreover, we must acknowledge grief and moral distress among nursing staff. Nursing leadership is needed to safeguard the quality of care and nursing staff should work together within an interprofessional care team to initiate advance care planning conversations in a timely manner, to review and document advance care plans, and to adapt goals of care as they may change due to the COVID-19 situation. Tweetable abstract: The current COVID-19 pandemic affects people living with dementia, their families and their professional caregivers. This rapid scoping review searched for academic and grey literature to formulate practical recommendations for nursing staff working in long-term care facilities on how to provide palliative care for people with dementia in times of COVID-19. There is a particular need for grief and bereavement support and we must acknowledge grief and moral distress among nursing staff. This review exposes practice and knowledge gaps in the response to COVID-19 that reflect the longstanding neglect and weaknesses of palliative care in the long-term care sector. Nursing leadership is needed to safeguard the quality of palliative care, interprofessional collaboration and peer support among nursing staff.","Bolt, Sascha R; van der Steen, Jenny T; Mujezinovic, Irma; Janssen, Daisy J A; Schols, Jos M G A; Zwakhalen, Sandra M G; Khemai, Chandni; Knapen, Els P A G M; Dijkstra, Lara; Meijers, Judith M M",Int J Nurs Stud,102,20

The previous report has demonstrated that chitosan mediates the differentiation of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) through insulin-like growth factors and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-2 axis in an in vitro model. However, whether chitosan can further treat olfactory dysfunction in vivo remains unexplored. This study aims to evaluate the therapeutic effect of chitosan on a 3-methylindole-induced anosmic rat model. Intraperitoneal injection of 3-methylindole is performed to induce anosmia in rats. Experimental results demonstrate that the food-finding duration after chitosan treatment gradually decrease to around 80 s, and both the olfactory neuroepithelium (ON) thickness and mature ORNs (expressing olfactory marker protein) are significantly restored. Furthermore, proliferating cells (expressing bromodeoxyuridine) are mainly co-expressed with immature ORNs (expressing ßIII tubulin) below the intermediate layer of the ON in the chitosan-treated group on day 28 following 3-methylindole treatment. Conversely, proliferating cells are scattered over the ON, and co-localized with immature ORNs and sustentacular cells (expressing keratin 18) in the sham group, and even immature ORNs go into apoptosis (expressing DNA fragmentation and cleaved caspase-3), possibly causing incomplete regeneration. Consequently, chitosan regenerates the ON by regulating olfactory neural homeostasis and reducing ORN apoptosis, and serves as a potential therapeutic intervention for olfactory dysfunction in the future.","Li, Sheng-Tien; Young, Tai-Horng; Huang, Tsung-Wei",Biomaterials,102,1

While a multitude of studies have demonstrated the theoretic potential of BCI, a point of concern is that the studies are still confined to lab settings and mostly limited to healthy, able-bodied subjects. The CYBATHLON 2020 BCI race represents an opportunity to further develop BCI design strategies for use in real-time applications with a tetraplegic end user. In this study, as part of the preparation to participate in CYBATHLON 2020 BCI race, we investigate the design aspects of BCI in relation to the choice of its components, in particular, the type of calibration paradigm and its relevance for long-term use. The end goal was to develop a user-friendly and engaging interface suited for long-term use, especially for a spinal-cord injured (SCI) patient. We compared the efficacy of conventional open-loop calibration paradigms with real-time closed-loop paradigms, using pre-trained BCI decoders. Various indicators of performance were analysed for this study, including the resulting classification performance, game completion time, brain activation maps and also subjective feedback from the pilot. Our results show that the closed-loop calibration paradigms with real-time feedback is more engaging for the pilot and helped to enhance the classification performance (p=0.0008). We also observe that stronger and more localized brain activation patterns are elicited in closed-loop paradigm in which the experiment interface closely resembled the end application. Thus, based on this longitudinal evaluation of single-subject data, we demonstrate the relevance of certain components of BCI design that may contirbute to user acceptability and better performance.","Robinson, Neethu Chouhan Tushar Mihelj Ernest Kratka Paulina Debraine Frédéric Wenderoth Nicole Guan Cuntai Lehner Rea",Frontiers in Human Neuroscience,102,32

ABCA1 promotes cholesterol efflux, reduces cellular cholesterol accumulation, and regulates anti-inflammatory activities in an apoA-I- or ANXA1-dependent manner. The latter activity occurs by mediating the efflux of ANXA1, which plays a critical role in anti-inflammatory effects, cholesterol transport, exosome and microparticle secretion, and apoptotic cell clearance. ApoA-I increases ANXA1 expression via the ERK, p38MAPK, AKT, and PKC pathways. ApoA-I regulates the signaling pathways by binding to ABCA1, suggesting that apoA-I increases ANXA1 expression by binding to ABCA1. Furthermore, ANXA1 may increase ABCA1 expression. ANXA1 increases PPARÎ³ expression by modulating STAT6 phosphorylation. PPARÎ³ also increases ANXA1 expression by binding to the promoter of ANXA1. Therefore, ABCA1, PPARÎ³, and ANXA1 may form a feedback loop and regulate each other. Interestingly, the ANXA1 needs to be externalized to the cell membrane or secreted into the extracellular fluids to exert its anti-inflammatory properties. ABCA1 transports ANXA1 from the cytoplasm to the cell membrane by regulating lipidization and serine phosphorylation, thereby mediating ANXA1 efflux, likely by promoting microparticle and exosome release. The direct role of ABCA1 expression and ANXA1 release in atherosclerosis has been unclear. In this review, we focus on the role of ANXA1 in atheroprogression and its novel interaction with ABCA1, which may be useful for providing basic knowledge for the development of novel therapeutic targets for atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease.","Shen, Xin; Zhang, Shun; Guo, Zhu; Xing, Dongming; Chen, Wujun",Mol Med,102,16

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of the COVID-19 response on biochemical test requests received from outpatient departments (OPDs) and peripheral clinics serviced by the National Health Laboratory Service Chemical Pathology Laboratory at Tygerberg Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa (SA). Request volumes were used as a measure of the routine care of patients, as clinical information was not readily available. METHODS: A retrospective audit was conducted. The numbers of requests received from OPDs and peripheral clinics for creatinine, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), lipid profiles, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine, free tri-iodothyronine (fT3), serum and urine protein electrophoresis, serum free light chains and neonatal total serum bilirubin were obtained from 1 March to 30 June for 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020. RESULTS: The biggest impact was seen on lipids, creatinine, HbA1c, TSH and fT3. The percentage reduction between 1 March and 30 June 2019 and between 1 March and 30 June 2020 was 59% for lipids, 64% for creatinine and HbA1c, 80% for TSH and 81% for fT3. There was a noteworthy decrease in overall analyte testing from March to April 2020, coinciding with initiation of level 5 lockdown. Although an increase in testing was observed during June 2020, the number of requests was still lower than in June 2019. CONCLUSIONS: This study, focusing on the short-term consequences of the SA response to the COVID-19 pandemic, found that routine follow-up of patients with communicable and non-communicable diseases was affected. Future studies are necessary to evaluate the long-term consequences of the pandemic for these patient groups.","Kruger, E C; Banderker, R; Erasmus, R T; Zemlin, A E",S Afr Med J,102,24

The Pituitary Society has produced recommendations to guide management during this era. We sought to assess contemporary neurosurgical practice and the effects of COVID-19. METHODS: A multicenter prospective observational cohort study was conducted at 12 tertiary neurosurgical units (United Kingdom and Ireland). Data were collected from March 23 to July 31, 2020, inclusive. The data points collected included patient demographics, preoperative COVID-19 test results, operative modifications, and 30-day COVID-19 infection rates. RESULTS: A total of 124 patients were included. Of the 124 patients, 116 (94%) had undergone COVID-19 testing preoperatively (transsphenoidal approach, 97 of 105 [92%]; expanded endoscopic endonasal approach, 19 of 19 [100%]). One patient (1 of 116 [0.9%]) had tested positive for COVID-19 preoperatively, requiring a delay in surgery until the infection had been confirmed as resolved. Other than transient diabetes insipidus, no other complications were reported for this patient. All operating room staff had worn at least level 2 personal protective equipment. Adaptations to surgical techniques included minimizing drilling, draping modifications, and the use of a nasal iodine wash. At 30 days postoperatively, no evidence of COVID-19 infection (symptoms or positive formal testing results) were found in our cohort and no mortality had occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative screening protocols and operative modifications have facilitated endonasal neurosurgery during the COVID-19 pandemic, with the Pituitary Society guidelines followed for most of these operations. We found no evidence of COVID-19 infection in our cohort and no mortality, supporting the use of risk mitigation strategies to continue endonasal neurosurgery in subsequent pandemic waves.","Bandyopadhyay, S.; Khan, D.

Considering its long-term effects on day to day lives, the necessity of wearing face mask and social distancing brings in picture the requirement of a contact less biometric system for all future authentication systems. One of the solutions is to use periocular biometric as it does not need physical contact like fingerprint biometric and is able to identify even people wearing face masks. Since, the periocular region is a small area as compared to face, extraction of required number of features from that small region is the major concern to make the system highly robust. This research proposes a feature fusion approach which combines the handcrafted features HOG, non-handcrafted features extracted using pretrained CNN models and gender related features extracted using a five layer CNN model. The proposed feature fusion approach is evaluated using multiclass SVM classifier with three different benchmark databases, UBIPr, Color FERET and Ethnic Ocular as well as for three non-ideal scenarios i.e. the effect of eyeglasses, effect of eye occlusion and pose variations.

We investigated whether patients with inflammatory bowel disease treated with infliximab have attenuated serological responses to a single dose of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. DESIGN: Antibody responses and seroconversion rates in infliximab-treated patients (n=865) were compared with a cohort treated with vedolizumab (n=428), a gut-selective anti-integrin &#945;4ß7 monoclonal antibody. Our primary outcome was anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) antibody concentrations, measured using the Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) antibody assay 3-10 weeks after vaccination, in patients without evidence of prior infection. Secondary outcomes were seroconversion rates (defined by a cut-off of 15 U/mL), and antibody responses following past infection or a second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine. RESULTS: Geometric mean (SD) anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody concentrations were lower in patients treated with infliximab than vedolizumab, following BNT162b2 (6.0 U/mL (5.9) vs 28.8 U/mL (5.4) p<0.0001) and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (4.7 U/mL (4.9)) vs 13.8 U/mL (5.9) p<0.0001) vaccines. In our multivariable models, antibody concentrations were lower in infliximab-treated compared with vedolizumab-treated patients who received the BNT162b2 (fold change (FC) 0.29 (95% CI 0.21 to 0.40), p<0.0001) and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (FC 0.39 (95% CI 0.30 to 0.51), p<0.0001) vaccines. In both models, age &#8805;60 years, immunomodulator use, Crohn's disease and smoking were associated with lower, while non-white ethnicity was associated with higher, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody concentrations. Seroconversion rates after a single dose of either vaccine were higher in patients with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and after two doses of BNT162b2 vaccine. CONCLUSION: Infliximab is associated with attenuated immunogenicity to a single dose of the BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Vaccination after SARS-CoV-2 infection, or a second dose of vaccine, led to seroconversion in most patients. Delayed second dosing should be avoided in patients treated with infliximab.

HCMV infection profoundly influences the host immune system and, perhaps more than any other human pathogen, has been shown to create a lasting imprint on human T and NK cell compartments. HCMV-seropositivity has been associated with both beneficial effects, such as increased vaccine responsiveness or heterologous protection against infections, and deleterious effects, such as pathological neurodevelopmental sequelae from congenital infection in utero and cumulative damage from chronic lifelong latency into old age. The significance of many of these associations is unclear, as studies into the causal mechanisms linking HCMV and these disease outcomes are lacking; however, HCMV-mediated changes to the immune system may play a key role.

Understanding the routes and pathogenesis of the coronavirus is important and it is considered that the studies on host cell receptor Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) may be valuable for the treatment and prevention of the disease. AIM: To evaluate the possibility of inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 at throat. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted. CONCLUSION: In view of the fact that the mouth and nose have higher number of ACE2 expressed cells, they serve as a gateway for the virus to enter. Thus, blocking the gate could be a good choice to reduce or even prevent the transmission. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are double-stranded RNA molecules and could be designed easily and directed against many strains of a virus. Due to their features, siRNAs can provide a potential strategy to interfere with the replication of viral diseases. We think that since oral and nasal epithelial cells are relatively easily accessible it may allow to develop siRNA molecules to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 already at the entry where it continues to replicate for a period (Fig. 1, Ref. 50).","Kaya, M; Abuaisha, A M; Serakinci, N; Ozturk, S",Bratisl Lek Listy,102,10

Current evidence and future perspectives,12.720879,8.585666,2020,"COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 has impacted all aspects of clinical practice in the UK. Cataract services suffered severe disruption due to necessary measures taken to reduce elective surgery in order to release capacity to support intensive care requirements. Faced with a potential 50% increase in cataract surgery workload per week in the post-COVID-19 world, eye units should use this event to innovate, not just survive but to also evolve for a sustainable future. In this article, we discuss the inadequacies of existing service rationing options to tackle the COVID-19 cataract backlog. This includes limiting rationing based on visual acuity, limiting surgery to first or only seeing eyes, and postponing clinic and surgical dates according to referral dates. We propose units use the lockdown time to reset and develop a comprehensive patient-centred care pathway using principles of value-based healthcare: the cataract integrated practice units. Developing an agile surgical database that incorporates all aspects of patient need from education to follow-up in their individual cataract journey will allow units to react and plan quickly in the early phase of recovery and beyond. We also discuss the considerations units should bear in mind on telemedicine, modifications for face-to-face clinics, theatre organisation and options of expanding cataract throughput capacity. The pause in elective surgery due to the pandemic may have provided cataract services a rare opportunity to reset and transform cataract service pathways for the digital era.","Lin, Pei-Fen; Naveed, Hasan; Eleftheriadou, Maria; Purbrick, Robert; Zarei Ghanavati, Mehran; Liu, Christopher",Br. j. ophthalmol,102,1

Personal protective equipment (PPE) use is recommended in all surgeries. The authors have experienced varying degrees of field of view (FOV) loss under the surgical microscope with different PPE. Herein, they aimed to investigate the effects of different PPE on FOV while using the surgical microscope. METHODS: Fifteen neurosurgeons and neurosurgery residents participated in this study. Three kinds of PPE (safety spectacles, blast goggles, and face shields) were tested while using a surgical microscope. FOV was measured using a 12 × 12-cm checkered sheet of paper on which every square had an area of 25 mm2 under the microscope. The surgical microscope was positioned perpendicular to the test paper, and the zoom was fixed. Each participant marked on the test sheet the peripheral borders of their FOV while using different PPE and without wearing any PPE. A one-way repeated-measures ANOVA was performed to determine if there was a significant difference in FOV values with the different PPE. RESULTS: FOV was significantly different between each PPE (F[3, 42] = 6339.845, p < 0.0005). Post hoc analysis revealed a significant decrease in the FOV from the naked eye (9305.33 ± 406.1 mm2) to blast goggles (2501.91 ± 176.5 mm2) and face shields (92.33 ± 6.4 mm2). There were no significant FOV changes with the safety spectacles (9267.45 ± 410.5 mm2). CONCLUSIONS: While operating under a surgical microscope safety spectacles provide favorable FOVs. Face shields increase the eye piece-pupil distance, which causes a severe reduction in FOV.","Celtikci, Emrah; Karaaslan, Burak; Börcek, Alp Özgün; Emmez, Omer Hakan",Neurosurg Focus,102,25

The hepato-biliary system and the pancreas may also be involved, usually with a mild elevation of transaminases and, rarely, pancreatitis. In contrast, a late hyper-inflammatory phenomenon, termed multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C), is characterized by more frequent gastrointestinal manifestations with greater severity, sometimes presenting as peritonitis.Gastrointestinal and hepato-biliary manifestations are probably related to a loss in enterocyte absorption capability and microscopic mucosal damage caused by viral infection of intestinal epithelial cells, hepatocytes and other cells through the angiotensin conversion enzyme 2 receptor resulting in immune cells activation with subsequent release of inflammatory cytokines. Specific conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and liver transplantation may pose a risk for more severe presentation of COVID-19 but as adult data accumulate, paediatric data is still limited.The aim of this review is to summarise the current evidence about the effect of COVID-19 on the gastrointestinal system in children, with emphasis on the emerging MIS-C and specific considerations such as patients with IBD and liver transplant recipients.","Assa, Amit; Benninga, Marc A; Borrelli, Osvaldo; Broekaert, Ilse; de Carpi, Javier Martin; Saccomani, Marco Deganello; Dolinsek, Jernej; Mas, Emmanuel; Miele, Erasmo; Thomson, Mike; Tzivinikos, Christos",J. pediatr. gastroenterol. nutr,102,15

However, when genomes have low variability in the early stages of a pandemic, the impact of technical and/or sequencing errors increases. We quantitatively assessed inter-laboratory differences in consensus genome assemblies of 72 matched SARS-CoV-2-positive specimens sequenced at different laboratories in Sydney, Australia. Raw sequence data were assembled using two different bioinformatics pipelines in parallel, and resulting consensus genomes were compared to detect laboratory-specific differences. Matched genome sequences were predominantly concordant, with a median pairwise identity of 99.997%. Identified differences were predominantly driven by ambiguous site content. Ignoring these produced differences in only 2.3% (5/216) of pairwise comparisons, each differing by a single nucleotide. Matched samples were assigned the same Pango lineage in 98.2% (212/216) of pairwise comparisons, and were mostly assigned to the same phylogenetic clade. However, epidemiological inference based only on single nucleotide variant distances may lead to significant differences in the number of defined clusters if variant allele frequency thresholds for consensus genome generation differ between laboratories. These results underscore the need for a unified, best-practices approach to bioinformatics between laboratories working on a common outbreak problem.","Foster, Charles S.P.; Stelzer-Braid, Sacha; Deveson, Ira W.; Bull, Rowena A.; Yeang, Malinna; Phan-Au, Jane; Silva, Mariana Ruiz; Hal, Sebastiaan J. van; Rockett, Rebecca J.; Sintchenko, Vitali; Kim, Ki Wook; Rawlinson, William D.",,102,16

Antibiotics are becoming less effective as new resistant strains appear. Therefore, the development of novel enhanced activity antibacterial agents becomes very significant. A combination of nanomaterials with different physical and chemical properties enables us to generate novel multi-functional derivatives. In this study, graphene oxide and polyvinylpyrrolidone-stabilized silver nanoparticles hybrid nanocomposite (GO-Ag HN) were synthesized. The relation between antibiotic resistance and GO-Ag HN potential toxicity to clinical P. aeruginosa strains, their antibiotic resistance, and molecular mechanisms were assessed. Methods: Chemical state, particle size distribution, and morphology of synthesized GO-Ag NH were investigated using spectroscopy and microscopy techniques (UV-Vis, FTIR, XPS, TEM, SEM, AFM). Broad-spectrum antibiotic resistance of P. aeruginosa strains was determined using E-test. Antibiotic resistance genes were identified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results: In this study, the toxicity of the GO-Ag NH to the isolated clinical P. aeruginosa strains has been investigated. A high antibiotic resistance level (92%) was found among P. aeruginosa strains. The most prevalent antibiotic resistance gene among tested strains was the AMPC beta-lactamase gene (65.6%). UV-vis, FTIR, and XPS studies confirmed the formation of the silver nanoparticles on the GO nanosheets. The functionalization process occurred through the interaction between Ag nanoparticles, GO, and polyvinylpyrrolidone used for nanoparticle stabilization. SEM analysis revealed that GO nanosheets undergo partial fragmentation during hybrid nanocomposite preparation, which remarkably increases the number of sharp edges and their mediated cutting effect. TEM analysis showed that GO-Ag HN spherical Ag nanoparticles mainly 9-12 nm in size were irregularly precipitated on the GO nanosheet surface. A higher density of Ag NPs was observed in the sheets' wrinkles, corrugations, and sharp edges. This hybrid nanocomposite poses enhanced antibacterial activity against carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa strains through a possible synergy between toxicity mechanisms of GO nanosheets and Ag nanoparticles. With incubation time increasing up to 10 minutes, the survival of P. aeruginosa decreased significantly. Conclusion: A graphene oxide and silver nanoparticles hybrid composite has been shown to be a promising material to control nosocomial infections caused by bacteria strains resistant to most antibiotics.","Lozovskis, Povilas; Jankauskaite, Virginija; Guobiene, Asta; Kareiviene, Violeta; Vitkauskiene, Astra",Int J Nanomedicine,102,7

We combine a model of customer movement with two models of disease transmission: direct exposure when two customers are in close proximity and wake exposure when one customer is in the airflow behind another customer. We find that the effectiveness of some operational interventions is sensitive to the primary mode of transmission. Restricting customer flow to one-way movement is highly effective if direct exposure is the dominant mode of transmission. In particular, the rate of direct transmission under full compliance with one-way movement is less than one-third the rate under two-way movement. Directing customers to follow one-way flow, however, is not effective if wake exposure dominates. We find that two other interventions-reducing the speed variance of customers and throughput control-can be effective whether direct or wake transmission is dominant. We also examine the trade-off between customer throughput and the risk of infection to customers, and we show how the optimal throughput rate drops rapidly as the population prevalence rises.","Shumsky, Robert A; Debo, Laurens; Lebeaux, Rebecca M; Nguyen, Quang P; Hoen, Anne G",Proc.

We aimed to identify participating occupational groups and methods for evaluation. Secondly, we aimed to describe resident-level interventions and which outcomes were measured. METHODS: Following extended PRISMA guideline for scoping reviews, we conducted systematic searches of Medline, CINAHL, Psychinfo, and ASSIA (2000-2019). Furthermore, we searched systematic reviews databases including Cochrane Library and JBI, and the grey literature database, Greylit. Four co-authors contributed to selection and data extraction. RESULTS: Sixty five studies were included, 6 of which had multiple publications (75 articles overall). A range of quality improvement strategies were implemented, including audit feedback and quality improvement collaboratives. Methods consisted of controlled trials, quantitative time series and qualitative interview and observational studies. Process evaluations, involving staff of various occupational groups, described experiences and implementation measures. Many studies measured resident-level outputs and health outcomes. 14 studies reported improvements to a clinical measure; however, four of these articles were of low quality. Larger randomised controlled studies did not show statistically significant benefits to resident health outcomes. CONCLUSION: In care homes, quality improvement has been applied with several different strategies, being evaluated by a variety of measures. In terms of measuring benefits to residents, process outputs and health outcomes have been reported. There was no pattern of which quality improvement strategy was used for which clinical problem. Further development of reporting of quality improvement projects and outcomes could facilitate implementation.","Chadborn, Neil H; Devi, Reena; Hinsliff-Smith, Kathryn; Banerjee, Jay; Gordon, Adam L",,102,20

Studies have suggested that pregnant women are more susceptible to COVID-19 compared to non-pregnant women. However, it's unclear whether pregnant women in Ghana are knowledgeable about COVID-19 and practice preventive measures against it. This study sought to assess the knowledge and preventive practices towards COVID-19 among pregnant women seeking antenatal services in Northern Ghana. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted using a structured questionnaire in the Nabdam district in Ghana. A total of 527 pregnant women were randomly sampled from health facilities offering antenatal care services in the district. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association between the predictors and outcome variables. RESULTS: The prevalence of adequate knowledge and good COVID-19 preventive practices were 85.6%, (95% CI: 82.57, 88.59) and 46.6%, (95% CI: 42.41, 50.95) respectively. Having at least a primary education, residing in an urban area, and receiving COVID-19 education at a health facility were positively associated with adequate knowledge on COVID-19. Factors positively associated with good COVID-19 preventive practices were older age, having at least a primary education, pregnant women with a chronic disease, and living in an urban area. Multiparity was negatively associated with good COVID-19 preventive practices. CONCLUSION: Although majority of women had adequate knowledge of COVID-19, less than half of them were engaged in good COVID-19 preventive practices. Education of pregnant women on COVID-19 preventive practices should be intensified at health facilities while improving upon the water, sanitation and hygiene need particularly in rural communities.","Kumbeni, Maxwell Tii; Apanga, Paschal Awingura; Yeboah, Eugene Osei; Lettor, Isaac Bador Kamal",PLoS One,102,16

Early reports that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was detectable in wastewater in advance of confirmed cases sparked widespread interest in wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) as a tool for mitigation of COVID-19 outbreaks. One hypothesis was that wastewater surveillance might provide a cost-effective alternative to other more expensive approaches such as pooled and random testing of groups. In this paper, we report the outcomes of a wastewater surveillance pilot program at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, a large urban university with a substantial population of students living in on-campus dormitories. Surveillance was conducted at the building level on a thrice-weekly schedule throughout the university's fall residential semester. In multiple cases, wastewater surveillance enabled the identification of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases that were not detected by other components of the campus monitoring program, which also included in-house contact tracing, symptomatic testing, scheduled testing of student athletes, and daily symptom reporting. In the context of all cluster events reported to the University community during the fall semester, wastewater-based testing events resulted in the identification of smaller clusters than were reported in other types of cluster events. Wastewater surveillance was able to detect single asymptomatic individuals in dorms with resident populations of 150-200. While the strategy described was developed for COVID-19, it is likely to be applicable to mitigation of future pandemics in universities and other group-living environments.","Gibas, Cynthia; Lambirth, Kevin; Mittal, Neha; Juel, Md Ariful Islam; Barua, Visva Bharati; Roppolo Brazell, Lauren; Hinton, Keshawn; Lontai, Jordan; Stark, Nicholas; Young, Isaiah; Quach, Cristine; Russ, Morgan; Kauer, Jacob; Nicolosi, Bridgette; Chen, Don; Akella, Srinivas; Tang, Wenwu; Schlueter, Jessica; Munir, Mariya",Sci Total Environ,102,26

OBJECTIVES: The aim of our research was to assess the performance of FREND&#8482; COVID-19 Ag assay (NanoEntek, South Korea) as a ultra-rapid frontline test for SARS-CoV-2 identification, in comparison with RT-PCR and another COVID-19 antigen fluorescence immunoassay (FIA). STUDY DESIGN: The qualitative FIA FREND&#8482; test, designed to detect within 3â¯min the Nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2, was evaluated using nasopharyngeal swabs in Universal Transport Medium (UTM&#8482;, Copan Diagnostics Inc, US) from suspected COVID-19 cases who accessed the Emergency Room of the Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Liguria, Northwest Italy. Diagnostic accuracy was determined in comparison with SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and STANDARD F&#8482; COVID-19 Ag FIA test (SD BIOSENSOR Inc., Republic of Korea). RESULTS: In November 2020, 110 nasopharyngeal samples were collected consecutively; 60 resulted RT-PCR positive. With respect to RT-PCR results, sensitivity and specificity of FREND&#8482; COVID-19 Ag test were 93.3 % (95 % CI: 83.8-98.2) and 100 % (95 % CI: 92.9-100), respectively.

Following the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, a study was undertaken of the prevalence of, and factors contributing to, symptoms of anxiety and depression among pregnant women in Shenzhen, China. METHODS: A cross-sectional study on pregnant women was conducted from September to December 2020 in Shenzhen, using a random-recruit method. The General Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) surveys were used to evaluate symptoms of anxiety and depression. A multivariate logistic regression model was developed to explore factors potentially associated with symptoms of anxiety and depression during pregnancy. RESULTS: A total of 3,434 pregnant women aged 15 to 59 years were enrolled. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were present in 9.8% and 6.9%, respectively. Logistic regression analysis using a stepwise procedure revealed that an increased risk of symptoms of anxiety and depression was associated with unmarried/divorced/widowed, unemployed, received professional psychological counseling, family dysfunction, the first trimester of pregnancy, pregnancy complications and vaginal bleeding, unplanned pregnancy, decline in household income and disputes between partners caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, consumption of alcoholic drinks by women and their partners, smoking, lack of exercise and sedentary lifestyle. Women with education from junior high school through college were less likely to experience symptoms of prenatal depression. CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed factors associated with psychological symptoms among pregnant women in the post-COVID-19-pandemic era. These results should help to update guidance for psychological interventions for pregnant women during the period of COVID-19.","Wu, Fei; Lin, Wei; Liu, Peiyi; Zhang, Minyi; Huang, Shengbin; Chen, Caiyun; Li, Qiushuang; Huang, Weikang; Zhong, Chuyan; Wang, Yueyun; Chen, Qing",J Affect Disord,102,1

Our goal is to minimize the number of fatalities over the course of two years without inducing excessive social costs. We consider a tailored model of the German COVID-19 outbreak with different parameter sets to design and validate our approach. Our analysis reveals that an open-loop optimal control policy can significantly decrease the number of fatalities when compared to simpler policies under the assumption of exact model knowledge. In a more realistic scenario with uncertain data and model mismatch, a feedback strategy that updates the policy weekly using model predictive control (MPC) leads to a reliable performance, even when applied to a validation model with deviant parameters. On top of that, we propose a robust MPC-based feedback policy using interval arithmetic that adapts the social distancing measures cautiously and safely, thus leading to a minimum number of fatalities even if measurements are inaccurate and the infection rates cannot be precisely specified by social distancing. Our theoretical findings support various recent studies by showing that (1) adaptive feedback strategies are required to reliably contain the COVID-19 outbreak, (2) well-designed policies can significantly reduce the number of fatalities compared to simpler ones while keeping the amount of social distancing measures on the same level, and (3) imposing stronger social distancing measures early on is more effective and cheaper in the long run than opening up too soon and restoring stricter measures at a later time.","Köhler, Johannes; Schwenkel, Lukas; Koch, Anne; Berberich, Julian; Pauli, Patricia; Allgöwer, Frank",Annual reviews in control,102,16

In the absence of firm evidence, these have been developed by expert committees, limited in participant number. This study aimed to validate international COVID-19 surgical guidance using a rapid Delphi consensus exercise. METHODS: Delphi statements were directly mapped to guidance from surgical professional bodies in the US and Europe (SAGES/EAES), the UK (Joint RCS), and Australasia (RACS), to validate content against international consensus. Agreement from &#8805;70% participants was determined as consensus agreement. RESULTS: The Delphi exercise was completed by 339 individuals from 41 countries and 52 statements were mapped to the guidance, 47 (90.4%) reaching consensus agreement. Of these, 27 statements were mapped to SAGES/EAES guidance, 21 to the Joint RCS document, and 33 to the RACS document. Within the SAGES/EAES document, 92.9% of items reached consensus agreement (median 89.0%, range 60.5-99.2%), 90.4% within the Joint RCS document (87.6%, 63.4-97.9%), and 90.9% within the RACS document (85.5%, 18.7-98.8%).

Here, we investigated additive effect of combination therapy using remdesivir with recombinant soluble ACE2 (high/low dose) on Vero E6 and kidney organoids, targeting two different modalities of SARS-CoV-2 life cycle: cell entry via its receptor ACE2 and intracellular viral RNA replication. This combination treatment markedly improved their therapeutic windows against SARS-CoV-2 in both models. By using single amino-acid resolution screening in haploid ES cells, we report a singular critical pathway required for remdesivir toxicity, namely Adenylate Kinase 2.

METHODS: Patients with RD who presented over a 1-year period (September 14, 2019 to September 13, 2020). The relationship between demographic, anatomic, and visual acuity parameters were compared before and after onset of the pandemic using generalized estimating equations. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Macular status and corrected distance visual acuity on presentation. RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-seven eyes, divided into 2 cohorts: pre-COVID (nâ¯=â¯100 September 14, 2019 to March 13, 2020) and post-COVID (nâ¯=â¯87, March 14, 2020 to September 13, 2020). Of the eyes, 63.2% (nâ¯=â¯87) presented with macular detachment in the post-COVID group compared with 45% (nâ¯=â¯100) in the pre-COVID group (odds ration [OR], 2.14; 95% confidence interval [CI],1.19-3.86; pâ¯=â¯0.011). As well, eyes in the pre-pandemic cohort had significantly fewer detached quadrants on initial examination (OR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.30-0.93; pâ¯=â¯0.026). Patients in the post-COVID group had a significantly worse corrected distance visual acuity at baseline (mean difference [MD]â¯=â¯-0.35 logMAR, 95% CI, -0.60 to -0.09; pâ¯=â¯0.008), but not at 1 month or at final follow-up.

New data on the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus are entering the public domain at a rapid rate such that their distillation often lags behind. To minimise weak associations becoming perceived as established paradigms, it is imperative that methodologies and outputs from different studies are appropriately critiqued and compared. In this review, we examine recent data on a potential relationship between smoking and COVID-19. While the causal role of smoking has been firmly demonstrated in regard to lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, such associations have the benefit of decades' worth of multi-centre epidemiological and mechanistic data. From our analysis of the available studies to date, it appears that a relationship is emerging in regard to patients with a smoking history having a higher likelihood of developing more severe symptoms of COVID-19 disease than non-smokers. Data on whether COVID-19 has a greater incidence in smokers than non-smokers is thus far, contradictory and inconclusive. There is therefore a need for some caution to be exercised until further research has been conducted in a wider range of geographical settings with sufficient numbers of patients that have been carefully phenotyped in respect of smoking status and adequate statistical control for confounding factors.","Shastri, Madhur D; Shukla, Shakti D; Chong, Wai Chin; Kc, Rajendra; Dua, Kamal; Patel, Rahul P; Peterson, Gregory M; O039,; Toole, Ronan F",Respir Med,102,6

No randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have tested interventions to reduce mental health consequences of contagious disease outbreaks. The primary objective of the Scleroderma Patient-centered Intervention Network COVID-19 Home-isolation Activities Together (SPIN-CHAT) Trial is to evaluate the effect of a videoconference-based program on symptoms of anxiety. Secondary objectives include evaluating effects on symptoms of depression, stress, loneliness, boredom, physical activity, and social interaction. METHODS: The SPIN-CHAT Trial is a pragmatic RCT that will be conducted using the SPIN-COVID-19 Cohort, a sub-cohort of the SPIN Cohort. Eligible participants will be SPIN-COVID-19 Cohort participants without a positive COVID-19 test, with at least mild anxiety (PROMIS Anxiety 4a v1.0 T-scoreâ¯&#8805;â¯55), not working from home, and not receiving current counselling or psychotherapy. We will randomly assign 162 participants to intervention groups of 7 to 10 participants each or waitlist control. We will use a partially nested RCT design to reflect dependence between individuals in training groups but not in the waitlist control. The SPIN-CHAT Program includes activity engagement, education on strategies to support mental health, and mutual participant support. Intervention participants will receive the 4-week (3 sessions per week) SPIN-CHAT Program via videoconference. The primary outcome is PROMIS Anxiety 4a score immediately post-intervention. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The SPIN-CHAT Trial will test whether a brief videoconference-based intervention will improve mental health outcomes among at-risk individuals during contagious disease outbreak.","Thombs, Brett D; Kwakkenbos, Linda; Carrier, Marie-Eve; Bourgeault, Angelica; Tao, Lydia; Harb, Sami; Gagarine, Maria; Rice, Danielle; Bustamante, Laura; Ellis, Kelsey; Duchek, Delaney; Wu, Yin; Bhandari, Parash Mani; Neupane, Dipika; Carboni-Jiménez, Andrea; Henry, Richard S; Krishnan, Ankur; Sun, Ying; Levis, Brooke; He, Chen; Turner, Kimberly A; Benedetti, Andrea; Culos-Reed, Nicole; El-Baalbaki, Ghassan; Hebblethwaite, Shannon; Bartlett, Susan J; Dyas, Laura; Patten, Scott; Varga, John",J Psychosom Res,102,1

There are two biotypes of BVDV: non-cytopathic (NCP) and cytopathic (CP). One strategy that has been used to treat or prevent virus-associated diseases is the modulation of autophagy, which is used by the innate immune system to defend against viral infection; however, at present, the interplay between autophagy and BVDV remains unclear. Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells stably expressing microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3B (LC3B) with green fluorescent protein (GFP) (GFP-LC3-MDBK cells) and autophagy-deficient MDBKs (shBCN1-MDBK cells) were constructed. Then MDBK, GFP-LC3-MDBK and shBCN1-MDBK cells were infected with CP or NCP BVDV strains. The LC3-II turnover rate was estimated by western blot, autophagosomes were visualized by confocal microscopy, and ultrastructural analysis was performed using electron microscopy. Autophagy flux was observed using chloroquine as an inhibitor of the autophagic process. The influence of autophagy on BVDV replication and release was investigated using virus titration, and its effect on cell viability was also studied. The effect of BVDV-induced autophagy on the survival of BVDV-infected host cell, cell apoptosis, and interferon (IFN) signalling was studied by flow cytometric analysis and quantitative RT-(q)PCR using shBCN1-MDBK cells. we found that infection with either CP or NCP BVDV strains induced steady-state autophagy in MDBK cells, as evident by the increased number of double- or single-membrane vesicles, the accumulation of GFP- microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) dots, and the conversion of LC3-I (cytosolic) to LC3-II (membrane-bound) forms. The complete autophagic process was verified by monitoring the LC3-II turnover ratio, lysosomal delivery, and proteolysis. In addition, we found that CP and NCP BVDV growth was inhibited in MDBK cells treated with high levels of an autophagy inducer or inhibitor, or in autophagy deficient-MDBK cells. Furthermore, our studies also suggested that CP and NCP BVDV infection in autophagy-knockdown MDBK cells increased apoptotic cell death and enhanced the expression of the mRNAs for IFN-α, Mx1, IFN-β, and OAS-1 as compared with control MDBK cells. Our study provides strong evidence that BVDV infection induces autophagy, which facilitates BVDV replication in MDBK cells and impairs the innate immune response. These findings might help to illustrate the pathogenesis of persistent infection caused by BVDV.","Zhou, Yulong; Ren, Yachao; Cong, Yanlong; Mu, Yu; Yin, Renfu; Ding, Zhuang",Arch Virol,102,18

What is not known is whether children with chronic respiratory illnesses have exacerbations associated with SARS-CoV-2 virus. METHODS: An expert panel created a survey, which was circulated twice (in April and May 2020) to members of the Paediatric Assembly of the European Respiratory Society (ERS) and via the social media of the ERS. The survey stratified patients by the following conditions: asthma, cystic fibrosis (CF), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and other respiratory conditions. RESULTS: In total 174 centres responded to at least one survey. 80 centres reported no cases, whereas 94 entered data from 945 children with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from 49 children with asthma of whom 29 required no treatment, 19 needed supplemental oxygen and four children required mechanical ventilation. Of the 14 children with CF and COVID-19, 10 required no treatment and four had only minor symptoms. Among the nine children with BPD and COVID-19, two required no treatment, five required inpatient care and oxygen and two were admitted to a paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) requiring invasive ventilation. Data were available from 33 children with other conditions and SARS-CoV-2 of whom 20 required supplemental oxygen and 11 needed noninvasive or invasive ventilation. CONCLUSIONS: Within the participating centres, in children with asthma and CF, infection with SARS-CoV-2 was well tolerated, but a substantial minority of children with BPD and other conditions required ventilatory support indicating that these latter groups are at risk from SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Moeller, Alexander; Thanikkel, Leo; Duijts, Liesbeth; Gaillard, Erol A.; Garcia-Marcos, Luis; Kantar, Ahmad; Tabin, Nathalie; Turner, Steven; Zacharasiewicz, Angela; Pijnenburg, Mariëlle W.H.",ERJ Open Res,102,3

Taking RT-PCR as the diagnostic gold standard, the quantitative spectral LIFA platform could correctly detect all 12 COVID-19 patients. Concerning RT-PCR negative patients, all three antibody testing methods found positive cases. The optical-based platform exhibited the ability of early detection of immunoglobulins of RT-PCR negative patients. There was an apparent trend that elevation of IgM levels in the acute phase of infection; then IgG levels rose later. It exhibited the risk of a false-negative diagnosis of RT-PCR in COVID-19 testing.

METHODS: We share novel insights from our experience in five HTx patients with COVID‐19 (three within 2 months post‐transplant) from our institution at the epicenter of the pandemic. Results: All five exhibited moderate (requiring hospitalization, n = 3) or severe (requiring ICU and/or mechanical ventilation, n = 2) illness. Both cases with severe illness were transplanted approximately 6 weeks before presentation and acquired COVID‐19 through community spread. All five patients were on immunosuppressive therapy with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and tacrolimus, and three that were transplanted within the prior 2 months were additionally on prednisone. The two cases with severe illness had profound lymphopenia with markedly elevated C‐reactive protein, procalcitonin, and ferritin. All had bilateral ground‐glass opacities on chest imaging. MMF was discontinued in all five, and both severe cases received convalescent plasma.

It aims to (a) explore the perceived psychological impact and future concerns; (b) evaluate vulnerability factors; (c) describe the perceived psychological impacts on participants whose psychological help and actual online psychotherapy was interrupted; and (d) explore the future need for psychological help. Procedure: An online survey was carried out (the first 2 weeks of lockdown in Santiago), which included sociodemographic data, perceived psychological impact, future concerns, and questions about psychological support. Participants: A total of 3,919 subjects answered, mostly women (80%). Results: The main perceived psychological impacts were concern (67%) and anxiety (60%). Future concerns were: general health (55.3%), employment (53.1%), and finances (49.8%). Younger participants had a greater perceived psychological impact (p's < 0.01) and concerns about employment, finances, mental health, stigma, and general health (p's < 0.001). Women reported more perceived psychological impact than men (p's < 0.05). Men reported mainly boredom (χ(2) = 11.82, gl = 1, p < 0.001). Dependent employees experienced more boredom, anxiety, distress, sleep problems, an inability to relax, and a lack of concentration than the self-employed (p's < 0.05). While the latter reported future concerns about employment and finances (p's < 0.001), dependent employees reported them on their general and mental health (p's < 0.001).

Costs of medications obtained inside and outside the pharmacy and other burdens associated with drugs’ unavailability are also estimated and explored. PATIENT AND METHODS: A facility-based cross-sectional study design was conducted from November 9 to November 23, 2020. Quantitative data on medication costs were collected from patients admitted to TikurAnbessa Specialized Hospital internal medicine ward B8. Qualitative information was collected from patients, caregivers, and health care professionals through interviews to assess the burdens of unavailability of pharmaceuticals on patients and the health care system. RESULTS: A total of 32 patients were enrolled in the study. Participants’ age ranged from 14 to 92. Eighteen (56.25%) paid in cash for medications bought within the hospital pharmacy, while the remaining 14 (43.75%) were treated for free. A total of 68 medicines were prescribed during the study period. Of this, 33 (48.53%) medicines were not available in the hospital pharmacy. The total costs of patients were 78.07$ and 1530.84$ when purchased from inside and outside the hospital pharmacy, respectively. The average price of medications per patient ranged from 0.025 to 8.41$ inside the hospital pharmacy, where the average cost per patient outside the hospital pharmacy ran from 0.128 to 54.67$. For the qualitative part, four patients and/or caregivers and five health care professionals were interviewed, and three key themes emerged from the thematic analysis: (i) awareness of the availability of medication, (ii) management of the burden of stock out, and (iii) impact of the stock out. CONCLUSION: The study came up with a result that the hospital pharmacy has high unavailability of medication.

This study examined the associations between health-related and socioeconomic stressors associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, and reported increases in cannabis use. Indirect effects of health-related and socioeconomic stressors on increased cannabis use through cannabis coping motives were also tested. Methods: Cross-sectional survey data, based on responses from a convenience sample of 755 Israeli adults who reported frequent consumption of cannabis for recreational purposes, was analyzed using structural equation models. Results: About 35% of the respondents reported that they agreed to a large/very large extent that their cannabis use had increased since the COVID-19 pandemic had started. Both health and socioeconomic stressors were related to increased cannabis use during the pandemic, and coping motives mediated this relationship. The direct and indirect associations of socioeconomic stressors and increased cannabis use were stronger than the associations of health-related stressors. Conclusions: Cannabis consumption may serve as a means of coping with health and socioeconomic COVID-19 stressors. Particular attention should be placed on socioeconomic stressors as these may be particularly important in understanding coping related cannabis use during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sznitman, Sharon; Rosenberg, Dennis; Lewis, Nehama",Subst Abus,102,1

Many of the comorbidities described in COVID-19 are also qualifying conditions for medical cannabis access. Bat guano has been identified as a rich source for novel coronavirus discovery and it is also a common fertilizer in the cannabis field. To better assess cannabis fomite risk we developed a SARs-CoV-2 quantitative PCR assay optimized to operate with a hemp flower background matrix. This assay was utilized to estimate the stability of gamma irradiated SARs-CoV-2 as a hemp flower fomite.","McKernan, Kevin; Kane, Liam T; Helbert, Yvonne",bioRxiv,102,23

OBJECTIVES: To provide an overview of reviews describing task shifts from physicians to allied healthcare workers in primary care and its impact on clinical outcomes. METHODS: Six electronic databases were searched up to 15 December 2020, to identify reviews describing task shifting in primary care. Two reviewers independently screened the references for relevant studies, extracted the data and assessed the methodological quality of included reviews using AMSTAR-2. RESULTS: Twenty-one reviews that described task shifting in primary care were included. Task shifted include provision of care for people with chronic conditions, medication prescribing, and health education. We found that task shifting could potentially improve several health outcomes such as blood pressure, HbA1c, and mental health while achieving cost savings. Key elements for successful implementation of task shifting include collaboration among all parties, a system for coordinated care, provider empowerment, patient preference, shared decision making, training and competency, supportive organisation system, clear process outcome, and financing. CONCLUSION: Evidence suggests that allied healthcare workers such as pharmacists and nurses can potentially undertake substantially expanded roles to support physicians in primary care in response to the changing health service demand. Tasks include providing care to patients, independent prescribing, counselling and education, with comparable quality of care.","Leong, Siew Lian; Teoh, Siew Li; Fun, Weng Hong; Lee, Shaun Wen Huey",The European journal of general practice,102,17

Infections caused by the pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza virus range from mild upper respiratory tract syndromes to fatal diseases. However, studies comparing virological and immunological profile of different clinical severity are lacking. Methods. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 74 patients with pandemic H1N1 infection, including 23 patients who either developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or died (ARDS-death group), 14 patients with desaturation requiring oxygen supplementation and who survived without ARDS (survived-without-ARDS group), and 37 patients with mild disease without desaturation (mild-disease group). We compared their pattern of clinical disease, viral load, and immunological profile. Results. Patients with severe disease were older, more likely to be obese or having underlying diseases, and had lower respiratory tract symptoms, especially dyspnea at presentation. The ARDS-death group had a slower decline in nasopharyngeal viral loads, had higher plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and were more likely to have bacterial coinfections (30.4%), myocarditis (21.7%), or viremia (13.0%) than patients in the survived-without-ARDS or the mild-disease groups. Reactive hemophagocytosis, thrombotic phenomena, lymphoid atrophy, diffuse alveolar damage, and multiorgan dysfunction similar to fatal avian influenza A H5N1 infection were found at postmortem examinations. Conclusions. The slower control of viral load and immunodysregulation in severe cases mandate the search for more effective antiviral and immunomodulatory regimens to stop the excessive cytokine activation resulting in ARDS and death.","To, Kelvin K.

However, true incidence of thromboembolic events is difficult to determine in the ICU setting. The aim of our study was to investigate the cumulative incidence of thromboembolic events in Covid-19 patients needing intensive care unit (ICU) admission and assessing the utility of point of care ultrasound (POCUS) to screen for and diagnose lower extremity deep venous thrombosis (DVT). METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study between April 22nd and May 26th, 2020 where all adult patients with the diagnosis of Covid-19 pneumonia admitted to 8 ICUs of Montefiore Medical Center were included. POCUS exam was performed on all patients at day 1 of ICU admission and at day 7 and 14 after the first exam. RESULTS: The primary outcome was to study the cumulative incidence of thromboembolic events in Covid-19 patients needing ICU admission. A total of 107 patients were included. All patients got POCUS exam on day 1 in the ICU, 62% got day 7 and 41% got day 14 exam. POCUS diagnosed 17 lower extremity DVTs on day 1, 3 new on day 7 and 1 new on day 14. Forty patients developed 52 thromboembolic events, with the rate of 37.3%. We found a high 45-day cumulative incidence of thromboembolic events of 37% and a high 45-day cumulative incidence of lower and upper extremity DVT of 21% and 10% respectively. Twelve (30%) patients had failure of therapeutic anticoagulation. Occurrence of a thromboembolic event was not associated with a higher risk of mortality (HR 1.08, p value = .81). CONCLUSIONS: Covid-19 patients in ICU have a high cumulative incidence of thromboembolic events, but not associated with higher mortality. POCUS is an excellent tool to help screen and diagnose DVT during a pandemic.","Kapoor, Sumit; Chand, Sudham; Dieiev, Vladyslav; Fazzari, Melissa; Tanner, Tristan; Lewandowski, David C.; Nalla, Anil; Abdulfattah, Omar; Aboodi, Michael S.; Shiloh, Ariel L.; Gong, Michelle N.",J Intensive Care Med,102,0

Fungi, particularly mushrooms, are the principal source of naturally occurring psychedelics. The mushroom extract, psilocybin has historically been used as a psychedelic agent for religious and spiritual ceremonies, as well as a therapeutic option for neuropsychiatric conditions. Psychedelic use was largely associated with the “hippie” counterculture movement, which, in turn, resulted in a growing, and still lingering, negative stigmatization for psychedelics. As a result, in 1970, the U.S. government rescheduled psychedelics as Schedule 1 drugs, ultimately ending scientific research on psychedelics. This prohibition on psychedelic drug research significantly delayed advances in medical knowledge on the therapeutic uses of agents such as psilocybin. A 2004 pilot study from the University of California, Los Angeles, exploring the potential of psilocybin treatment in patients with advanced-stage cancer managed to reignite interest and significantly renewed efforts in psilocybin research, heralding a new age in exploration for psychedelic therapy. Since then, significant advances have been made in characterizing the chemical properties of psilocybin as well as its therapeutic uses. This review will explore the potential of psilocybin in the treatment of neuropsychiatry-related conditions, examining recent advances as well as current research.

The COVID-19 pandemic has been suspected to increase online gambling and gambling problems. In a number of recent media reports, day trading has been reported to increase during COVID-19, possibly in relation to changes in everyday life, financial problems and job insecurity during the pandemic. Increasing day trading has thereby been suspected to cause addictive behavior, financial difficulties, and poor mental health. However, there is hitherto a lack of research in the area. The present paper addresses the potential for day trading to cause problem gambling, debts and mental health problems, and calls for research and clinical guidelines in problem gambling related to stock market behavior as a problematic gambling behavior.

Despite the growing evidence, current knowledge on the subject remains insufficient, so that data obtained with different tools, from multiple centers and in distinct scenarios are welcome. Yet, the predictive value of olfactory dysfunction in terms of the overall prognosis of COVID-19 is unknown. This study aims to evaluate the olfactory function of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and the impact of the results on their clinical outcomes. METHODS: Patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) admitted to a university tertiary hospital were recruited and divided into those with ARDS due to COVID-19, and those with ARDS of any other cause. Sociodemographic and clinical data were collected at baseline and the patients had their objective olfactory function evaluated by the Alcohol Sniff Test on admission and during hospital stay. The participants were then followed up until reaching an endpoint: hospital discharge, endotracheal intubation, transfer to the intensive care unit, or death. Patients with COVID-19 were also subgrouped and compared according to their olfactory thresholds and to their overall clinical outcomes. The obtained data was analyzed using R software. Level of significance was set at 0.05. RESULTS: Eighty-two patients were included (of which 58 had COVID-19). 87.93% of the patients with COVID-19 had diminished olfactory dysfunction on admission. The mean length of hospital stay among patients with olfactory dysfunction was greater (7.84 vs 6.14 days) and nine individuals in this subgroup had poor overall outcomes. None of those with normal olfactory function developed critical COVID-19. The mean olfactory function was significantly worse among patients with COVID-19 and poor outcomes (3.97 vs 7.90 cm, P = .023). CONCLUSION: Objective olfactory dysfunction is frequent in ARDS caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients with longitudinal poorer outcomes present worse olfactory thresholds on admission.","Mangia, Lucas Resende Lucinda; Soares, Marcelly Botelho; de Souza, Thiago Sasso Carmona; De Masi, Roberta David João; Scarabotto, Patrícia Cristina; Hamerschmidt, Rogério",Auris Nasus Larynx,102,20

Asymptomatic and symptomatic patients can transmit SARS-CoV-2. This study aimed to study the humoral immune response in Saudis who are Covid-19 symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. We created three types of enzyme-linked immunosorbant assays (ELISAs) to reveal IgG and IgM antibodies (Abs) against SARS-CoV-2. The developed ELISAs were designed to detect Abs against SARS-CoV-2 N, S and N + S proteins. A number of Covid-19 symptomatic (1 5 3) and asymptomatic (84) RT–PCR-confirmed patient sera were used to evaluate the ELISAs and to determine the IgG and IgM antibody profile in those patients. The sensitivity and specificity of these ELISAs were evaluated using pre-Covid-19 pandemic serum samples. The results revealed the existence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM Abs in Covid-19 symptomatic and asymptomatic Saudi persons. The use of SARS-CoV-2 N and S proteins in the same ELISA greatly increased the detectability of infection. In conclusion, the Covid-19 symptomatic and asymptomatic Saudi persons demonstrated both IgG and IgM antibody profile with higher titer in symptomatic patients.

Previous research indicated that young people are especially vulnerable for a wide range of mental health problems during the pandemic, but little is known about the mechanisms. This study examined mental distress and its contributing factors among young Belgian people. Methods: An online survey was widely distributed in Belgium during the first wave of COVID-19 in March, and 16–25-year-olds were selected as a subsample. Mental distress was assessed using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), and a threshold of ≥4 was used to discriminate mental distress cases from non-cases. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate possible predictors of mental distress, including demographics, chronic condition, history of mental health problems, social support, exposure to COVID-19, and several changes in everyday activities. Results: A total of 2,008 respondents were included, of which the majority was female (78.09%) and student (66.82%). The results indicate that about two thirds (65.49%) experienced mental distress. In the multivariable regression model, significant (p < 0.01) predictors of mental distress were female gender (OR = 1.78), low social support (OR = 2.17), loneliness (OR = 5.17), a small (OR = 1.63), or large (OR = 3.08) increase in social media use, a small (OR = 1.63) or large (OR = 2.17) decrease in going out for drinks or food, and a decrease in doing home activities (OR = 2.72). Conclusion: Young people experience high levels of mental distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings indicate that mental distress was highest among women, those experiencing loneliness or low social support and those whose usual everyday life is most affected.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged in 2012, causing severe acute respiratory disease and pneumonia, with 44% mortality among 136 cases to date. Design of vaccines to limit the virus spread or diagnostic tests to track newly emerging strains requires knowledge of antigenic and serologic relationships between MERS-CoV and other CoVs. Methods. Using synthetic genomics and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicons (VRPs) expressing spike and nucleocapsid proteins from MERS-CoV and other human and bat CoVs, we characterize the antigenic responses (using Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and serologic responses (using neutralization assays) against 2 MERS-CoV isolates in comparison with those of other human and bat CoVs. Results. Serologic and neutralization responses against the spike glycoprotein were primarily strain specific, with a very low level of cross-reactivity within or across subgroups. CoV N proteins within but not across subgroups share cross-reactive epitopes with MERS-CoV isolates. Our findings were validated using a convalescent-phase serum specimen from a patient infected with MERS-CoV (NA 01) and human antiserum against SARS-CoV, human CoV NL63, and human CoV OC43. Conclusions. Vaccine design for emerging CoVs should involve chimeric spike protein containing neutralizing epitopes from multiple virus strains across subgroups to reduce immune pathology, and a diagnostic platform should include a panel of nucleocapsid and spike proteins from phylogenetically distinct CoVs.","Agnihothram, Sudhakar; Gopal, Robin; Yount, Boyd L.; Donaldson, Eric F.; Menachery, Vineet D.; Graham, Rachel L.; Scobey, Trevor D.; Gralinski, Lisa E.; Denison, Mark R.; Zambon, Maria; Baric, Ralph S.",The Journal of Infectious Diseases,102,16

Acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) are responsible for considerable morbidity in the community, but little is known about the presence of respiratory pathogens in asymptomatic individuals. We hypothesized that asymptomatic persons could have a subclinical infection and thus act as a source of transmission. Methods. During the period of 2000–2003, all patients with ARTI who visited their sentinel general practitioner had their data reported to estimate the incidence of ARTI in Dutch general practices. A random selection of these patients (case patients) and an equal number of asymptomatic persons visiting for other complaints (control subjects) were included in a case-control study. Nose and throat swabs of participants were tested for a broad range of pathogens. Results. The overall incidence of ARTI was 545 cases per 10,000 person-years, suggesting that, in the Dutch population, an estimated 900,000 persons annually consult their general practitioner for respiratory complaints. Rhinovirus was most common in case patients (24%), followed by influenza virus type A (11%) and coronavirus (7%). Viruses were detected in 58% of the case patients, β-hemolytic streptococci group A were detected in 11%, and mixed infections were detected in 3%. Pathogens were detected in ∼30% of control subjects, particularly in the youngest age groups. Conclusion. This study confirms that most ARTIs are viral and supports the reserved policy of prescribing antibiotics. In both case and control subjects, rhinovirus was the most common pathogen. Of bacterial infections, only group A β-hemolytic streptococci were more common in case patients than in control subjects. Furthermore, we demonstrated that asymptomatic persons might be a neglected source of transmission.","van Gageldonk-Lafeber, Arianne B.; Heijnen, Marie-Louise A.; Bartelds, Aad I.M.; Peters, Marcel F.; van der Plas, Simone M.; Wilbrink, Berry",Clin Infect Dis,102,1

In relation with these measures, particularly with the staying at home, increasing rates of domestic violence are beginning to surface. Hence, this study was aimed at determining the prevalence of intimate partner violence against reproductive age women in northern Ethiopia during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study design was employed. The data were collected during the period of April to May, 2020 using interviews and a self-administered standard questionnaire. The data were entered into the Epi-data manager version 4.2 and exported to SPSS 22 for analysis. The descriptive analysis such as frequency distribution, percentage, and measures of central tendency were used. This was followed by binary and multiple logistic regression analysis to infer the association between the outcome and independent variables. RESULTS: A total of 682 participants were included in the study. The prevalence of intimate partner violence against women was found to stood at 24.6% with psychological violence being the most prevalent (13.3%), followed by physical (8.3%) and sexual violence (5.3%). Women were more likely to suffer from violence if they were housewives (AOR, 95% CI (18.062 (10.088, 32.342))), age less than 30 (AOR, 95% CI (23.045 (5.627, 94.377))), women with arrange marriage (AOR, 95% CI (2.535 (1.572, 4.087))) and women with husband’s age being “between” 31–40 (AOR, CI 95% (2.212 (1.024, 4.777))). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed the presence of a relatively high prevalence of intimate partner violence against women. Thus, public reporting of any cases or concerns of abuse is critical and vital to mitigate the problem.","Gebrewahd, Gebremeskel Tukue; Gebremeskel, Gebreamlak Gebremedhn; Tadesse, Degena Bahrey",Reprod Health,102,8

We evaluated the association between RAAS inhibitor use and outcomes of Covid-19. METHODS: This study was a retrospective observational cohort study that used data based on insurance benefit claims sent to the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service of Korea by May 15, 2020. These claims comprised all Covid-19 tested cases and the history of medical service use in these patients for the past five years. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, and the rate of ventilator care was compared between the groups. RESULTS: From a total of 7,590 patients diagnosed with Covid-19, two distinct cohorts were generated based on RAAS inhibitors prescribed within 6 months before Covid-19 diagnosis. A total of 1,111 patients was prescribed RAAS inhibitors, and 794 patients were prescribed antihypertensive drugs, excluding RAAS inhibitors. In propensity-score matched analysis, 666 pairs of data set were generated, and all-cause mortality of the RAAS inhibitor group showed no significant difference compared with the non-RAAS inhibitor group (14.6% vs. 11.1%; hazard ratio [HR], 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.54–1.15; p = 0.22). The rate of ventilator care was not significantly different between the two groups (4.4% vs. 4.1%; HR, 1.04; 95%CI, 0.60–1.79; p = 0.89). CONCLUSIONS: RAAS inhibitor treatment did not appear to increase the mortality of Covid-19 patients compared with other antihypertensive drugs, suggesting that they may be safely continued in Covid-19 patients.","Park, Jungchan; Lee, Seung-Hwa; You, Seng Chan; Kim, Jinseob; Yang, Kwangmo",PLoS One,102,10

We obtained serum from thirteen COVID-19 patients. Most individuals revealed neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 assessed by a pseudotype virus-neutralizing assay. The antibody production against the spike glycoprotein (S protein) or receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 was elevated, with large individual differences, as assessed by ELISA. In the analysis of the predicted the linear B cell epitopes, two regions (671-690 aa. and 1146-1164 aa.), which were located in S1 and S2 but not in the RBD, were highly reactive with the sera from patients. In the further analysis of the B cell epitope within the S protein by utilizing a B cell epitope array, a hot spot in the N-terminal domain of the S protein but not the RBD was observed in individuals with neutralizing activity. Overall, the analysis of antibody production and B cell epitopes of the S protein from patient serum may provide a novel target for the vaccine development against SARS-CoV-2.","Yoshida, Shota; Ono, Chikako; Hayashi, Hiroki; Shiraishi, Satoshi; Kazunori, Tomono; Arase, Hisashi; Matsuura, Yoshiharu; Nakagami, Hironori",bioRxiv,102,28

By analyzing interferon responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors conditioned with heat-killed Candida, trained innate immunity can be modeled in vitro. In this model, hydroxychloroquine inhibits the responsiveness of these innate immune cells to virus-like stimuli and interferons. This is associated with a suppression of histone 3 lysine 27 acetylation and histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation of inflammation-related genes, changes in the cellular lipidome, and decreased expression of interferon-stimulated genes.

Non-critical coronavirus disease 2019 patients often lack follow up visits which has led to incomplete understanding of disease process. The aim of this study was to find out the prevalence of persistent symptoms in such patients during two months follow-up to a district hospital. METHODS: This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in a district hospital from September 2020 to February 2021 among non-critical corona virus disease 2019 patients admitted to the isolation center of Nepal. Ethical approval was taken from the ethical review board of Nepal Health Research Council (reference number: 1707). Convenience sampling was done. Data was collected using a structured questionnaire. Data analysis was done using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 26. Point estimate at 95% Confidence Interval was calculated along with frequency and proportion for binary data. RESULTS: Out of 132 patients, 66 (50%) (41.5-58.5 at 95% Confidence Interval) patients had persistent symptoms at two-month follow-up. Forty-eight (36.4%) patients showed one symptom, 15 (11%) had two symptoms, and 3 (2%) had two or more symptoms. The most frequent symptom reported was fatigue in 17 (13%), cough in 15 (11%), myalgia in 9 (7%), and headache in 9 (7%). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of persistent symptoms at two months follow up in our study was lower than findings from other international studies.","Tiwari, Bishal; Ghimire, Manoj; Bhatta, Gaurab; Banstola, Hemant; Tiwari, Bimala; Twayana, Anuradha; Shrestha, Karun",JNMA J Nepal Med Assoc,102,16

Traditional sequence alignment methods are not suitable and there is a need for fast alignment-free techniques for sequence analysis. Information theory and data compression algorithms provide a rich set of mathematical and computational tools to capture essential patterns in biological sequences. In 2013, our research group (Nagaraj et al., Eur. Phys. J. Special Topics 222(3-4), 2013) has proposed a novel measure known as Effort-To-Compress (ETC) based on the notion of compression-complexity to capture the information content of sequences. In this study, we propose a compression-complexity based distance measure for automatic identification of SARS coronavirus strains from a set of viruses using only short fragments of nucleotide sequences. We also demonstrate that our proposed method can correctly distinguish SARS-CoV-2 from SARS-CoV-1 viruses by analyzing very short segments of nucleotide sequences. This work could be extended further to enable medical practitioners in automatically identifying and characterizing SARS coronavirus strain in a fast and efficient fashion using short and/or incomplete segments of nucleotide sequences. Potentially, the need for sequence assembly can be circumvented. Note The main ideas and results of this research were first presented at the International Conference on Nonlinear Systems and Dynamics (CNSD-2013) held at Indian Institute of Technology, Indore, December 12, 2013.

Its environmental impacts include acid rains, reduced visibility, but more importantly and significantly, it affects human health. The price tag of not managing AP is seen in the rise of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cardiovascular disease, and respiratory ailments like asthma and chronic bronchitis. But as the world battles the corona pandemic, COVID-19 lockdown has abruptly halted human activity, leading to a significant reduction in AP levels. The effect of this reduction is captured by reduced cases of morbidity and mortality associated with air pollution. The current study aims to monetarily quantify the decline in health impacts due to reduced AP levels under lockdown scenario, as against business as usual, for four cities—Delhi, London, Paris, and Wuhan. The exposure assessment with respect to pollutants like particulate matter (PM(2.5) and PM(10)), NO(2), and SO(2) are evaluated. Value of statistical life (VSL), cost of illness (CoI), and per capita income (PCI) for disability-adjusted life years (DALY) are used to monetize the health impacts for the year 2019 and 2020, considering the respective period of COVID-19 lockdown of four cities. The preventive benefits related to reduced AP due to lockdown is evaluated in comparison to economic damage sustained by these four cities. This helps in understanding the magnitude of actual damage and brings out a more holistic picture of the damages related to lockdown.","Bherwani, Hemant; Nair, Moorthy; Musugu, Kavya; Gautam, Sneha; Gupta, Ankit; Kapley, Atya; Kumar, Rakesh",Air Qual Atmos Health,102,27

However, Iraq has had capital-focused health services and successive conflicts and political turmoil have hampered health services around the country. Iraq has embarked on a new reconstruction process since 2018 and it could be time to aim for equitable healthcare access to realise UHC. We aimed to examine inequality and determinants associated with Iraq's progress towards UHC targets. METHODS: We assessed the progress toward UHC in the context of equity using six nationally representative population-based household surveys in Iraq in 2000-2018. We included 14 health service indicators and two financial risk protection indicators in our UHC progress assessment. Bayesian hierarchical regression model was used to estimate the trend, projection, and determinant analyses. Slope and relative index of inequality were used to assess wealth-based inequality. RESULTS: In the national-level health service indicators, inequality indices decreased substantially from 2000 to 2030. However, the wide inequalities are projected to remain in DTP3, measles, full immunisations, and antenatal care in 2030. The pro-rich inequality gap in catastrophic health expenditure increased significantly in all governorates except Sulaimaniya from 2007 to 2012. The higher increases in pro-rich inequality were found in Missan, Karbala, Erbil, and Diala. Mothers' higher education and more antenatal care visits were possible factors for increased coverage of health service indicators. The higher number of children and elderly population in the households were potential risk factors for an increased risk of catastrophic and impoverishing health payment in Iraq. CONCLUSIONS: To reduce inequality in Iraq, urgent health-system reform is needed, with consideration for vulnerable households having female-heads, less educated mothers, and more children and/or elderly people. Considering varying inequity between and within governorates in Iraq, reconstruction of primary healthcare across the country and cross-sectoral targeted interventions for women should be prioritised.","Taniguchi, Hiroko; Rahman, Md Mizanur; Swe, Khin Thet; Islam, Md Rashedul; Rahman, Md Shafiur; Parsell, Nadia; Hussain, Ashraf; Shibuya, Kenji; Hashizume, Masahiro",Int J Equity Health,102,22

The purpose of this study was to assess the impacts of the lockdown measures on air quality and pollutant emissions in Valencia, Spain. For this reason, we determined if there was a significant difference in the concentration levels of different particulate matter (PM) sizes, PM(10), PM(2.5), and NO(x), NO(2), NO, and O(3,) between the period of restrictions in 2020 and the same period in 2019. Our findings indicated that PM pollutant levels during the lockdown period were significantly different from the same period of the previous year, even if there is variability in the different local areas. The highest variations reduction in the PM(10) and PM(2.5) levels were observed for the València Centre, València Avd Francia, and València Pista de Silla (all of the urban traffic type) in which there was a reduction of 58%–42%, 56%–53%, and 60%–41% respectively. Moreover, consistent with recent studies, we observed a significant reduction in nitric oxide levels in all the air monitoring stations. In all seven monitoring stations, it was observed, in 2020, NO(x), NO(2), and NO concentrations decreased by 48.5%–49.8%–46.2%, 62.1%–67.4%–45.7%, 37.4%–35.7%–35.3%, 60.7%–67.7%–47.1%, 65.5%–65.8%–63.5%, 60.0%–64.5%–41.3%, and 60.4%–61.6%–52.5%, respectively. Lastly, overall O(3) levels decreased during the lockdown period, although this phenomenon was more closely related to weather conditions. Overall, no significant differences were observed between the meteorological conditions in 2019 and 2020. Our findings suggest that further studies on the effect of human activities on air quality are needed and encourage the adoption of a holistic approach to improve urban air quality.","Donzelli, Gabriele; Cioni, Lorenzo; Cancellieri, Mariagrazia; Llopis-Morales, Agustin; Morales-Suárez-Varela, María",Int J Environ Res Public Health,102,1

We aim to describe a cohort of older adults admitted in an inner-city London hospital during the first peak of the pandemic. METHODS: A retrospective observational study that enrolled older adults consecutively admitted into two geriatric wards with suspected or confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We collected socio-demographic data, comorbidities, symptoms at presentation and/or during admission, biochemical and radiological data and outcomes at 28 days. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-four patients were included, and 75% were > 80 years old. 19.5% of COVID-19 cases were judged to be hospital-acquired. More than half presented or developed typical symptoms, respiratory failure or fatigue. 46.8% were diagnosed with delirium, 24.2% with falls and dysphagia was present in 13.7%. The mortality rate was 29.8% and was higher among males, those > 80 years, patients with a higher grade of frailty, a history of dementia or chronic kidney disease, as well as those diagnosed with respiratory failure, acute kidney injury or hypernatremia. Independent predictors of mortality were male sex, age > 80 years, respiratory failure and hypernatremia. CONCLUSION: We have described a cohort of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the first UK peak of the global pandemic.

We aimed to investigate whether socioeconomic status affected the risk of contracting COVID-19 in the South Korean population. METHODS: The NHIS-COVID-19 database cohort was used in this population-based study. We collected the data of COVID-19 patients who were diagnosed between January 1, 2020 and June 4, 2020 and those of the control population. The income levels of all individuals as of February 2020 were extracted, and study participants were classified into four groups based on quartiles: Q1 (the lowest) to Q4 (the highest). Data were statistically analyzed using multivariable logistic regression modeling. RESULTS: In total, 122,040 individuals—7669 and 114,371 individuals in the COVID-19 and control groups, respectively—were included in the final analysis. The multivariable logistic regression model showed that the Q1 group had a 1.19-fold higher risk of contracting COVID-19 than the Q4 group, whereas the Q2 and Q3 groups showed no significant differences. In the 20–39 years age group, compared with the Q4 group, the Q3 and Q2 groups showed 11 and 22% lower risks of contracting COVID-19, respectively. In the ≥60 years age group, compared with the Q4 group, the Q1, Q2, and Q3 groups showed a 1.39-, 1.29-, and 1.14-fold higher risks of COVID-19, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Lower socioeconomic status was associated with a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 in South Korea. This association was more evident in the older population (age ≥ 60 years), whereas both lower and higher socioeconomic statuses were associated with higher risks of contracting COVID-19 in the young adult population (in the 20–39 year age group). Strategies for the prevention of COVID-19 should focus on individuals of lower socioeconomic status and on young adults of higher and lower socioeconomic status.

During this time, employers played a key role, along with employees involved in Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) activities, as they were responsible for implementing the recommendations of the European Commission. There is no unambiguous definition of OHS in Polish legislation. It is assumed that it is a set of rules defining the manner of performing work, and above all, a method of providing employees with working conditions so that their performance is safe and hygienic. Responsibility for the health and safety in the workplace is imposed on the employer by the legislature. Thus, effective health and safety training is an essential element of the success of any properly operating company. In the literature, no studies have been identified that evaluate the effectiveness of actions during the COVID-19 outbreak. The aim of the article is to present the actions of Polish employers along with their effectiveness assessment related to the protection of employees during the COVID-19 outbreak. The article presents a proposal for conducting remote OHS (Occupational Health and Safety) training using the platform Moodle. The created course was implemented during OHS training conducted in a selected manufacturing company. At its end, an evaluation of the course was carried out, and the collected opinions of training participants allowed the formulation of interesting conclusions, which became the contribution of this paper. The authors pay special attention to three main points of the work. The first is the form of training, which gives the possibility to conduct training at a distance while maintaining its effectiveness. The second important point is the mandatory feedback of the trainees, ensuring the possibility of continuous improvement and quality enhancement of both the program and the form of training. The evaluation was developed on the basis of the extended Kirkpatrick model, which is a completely new approach to OHS training evaluation. The third point emphasized by the authors is the possibility of precise adaptation of the training to other plants and even industries. Therefore, it can be concluded that the course developed by the authors is a very interesting and practical didactic tool with great implementation potential.","Bartnicka, Joanna; Kabiesz, Patrycja; Palka, Dorota; Gajewska, Paulina; Islam, Ejaz Ul; Szymanek, Damian",Int J Environ Res Public Health,102,13

OBJECTIVE.­: To develop and implement a digital slide-based virtual surgical pathology (VSP) clinical elective to meet the demand for meaningful and robust virtual clinical electives in response to the temporary suspension of in-person clinical rotations at JHUSOM. DESIGN.­: The VSP elective was modeled after the in-person surgical pathology elective to include virtual previewing and sign-out with standardized cases supplemented by synchronous and asynchronous pathology educational content. RESULTS.­: Validation of existing Web communications technology and slide-scanning systems was performed by feasibility testing. Curriculum development included drafting of course objectives and syllabus, Blackboard course site design, electronic-lecture creation, communications with JHUSOM leadership, scheduling, and slide curation. Subjectively, the weekly schedule averaged 35 to 40 hours of asynchronous, synchronous, and independent content, approximately 10 to 11 hours of which were synchronous. As of February 2021, VSP has hosted 35 JHUSOM and 8 non-JHUSOM students, who have provided positive subjective and objective course feedback. CONCLUSIONS.­: The Johns Hopkins VSP elective provided meaningful clinical experience to 43 students in a time of immense online education need. Added benefits of implementing VSP included increased medical student exposure to pathology as a medical specialty and demonstration of how digital slides have the potential to improve standardization of the pathology clerkship curriculum.","White, Marissa J; Birkness, Jacqueline E; Salimian, Kevan J; Meiss, Alice E; Butcher, Monica; Davis, Katelynn; Ware, Alisha D; Zarella, Mark D; Lecksell, Kristen; Rooper, Lisa M; Cimino-Mathews, Ashley; VandenBussche, Christopher J; Halushka, Marc K; Thompson, Elizabeth D",Arch Pathol Lab Med,102,16

This fact has raised concerns and uncertainties about the possible risks of NMs to human health and the adverse effects on the environment. These concerns underline the need and importance of assessing its nanosecurity. The present review focuses on the main mechanisms underlying the MOx NPs toxicity, illustrated with different biological models: release of toxic ions, cellular uptake of NPs, oxidative stress, shading effect on photosynthetic microorganisms, physical restrain and damage of cell wall. Additionally, the biological models used to evaluate the potential hazardous of nanomaterials are briefly presented, with particular emphasis on the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as an alternative model in nanotoxicology. An overview containing recent scientific advances on cellular responses (toxic symptoms exhibited by yeasts) resulting from the interaction with MOx NPs (inhibition of cell proliferation, cell wall damage, alteration of function and morphology of organelles, presence of oxidative stress bio-indicators, gene expression changes, genotoxicity and cell dead) is critically presented. The elucidation of the toxic modes of action of MOx NPs in yeast cells can be very useful in providing additional clues about the impact of NPs on the physiology and metabolism of the eukaryotic cell. Current and future trends of MOx NPs toxicity, regarding their possible impacts on the environment and human health, are discussed. KEY POINTS: • The potential hazardous effects of MOx NPs are critically reviewed. • An overview of the main mechanisms associated with MOx NPs toxicity is presented. • Scientific advances about yeast cell responses to MOx NPs are updated and discussed.","Soares, Eduardo V.; Soares, Helena M.

It can be transmitted from a person to another through droplets and that makes the dentists at high risk of infection. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to assess the awareness and knowledge of dental students about the signs and symptoms of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and to evaluate their awareness about the required infection control measures during the dental treatment to control the spread of the disease. A questionnaire was formed using Google forms and distributed among dental students and interns in different universities in Cairo, Egypt. Questions were about signs and symptoms of COVID-19, attitude of the dentists toward dental treatment of suspected patients and the required personal protective equipment (PPE) and infection control measures at the dental clinic. RESULTS: The majority of the participants strongly agreed/agreed that COVID-19 is a highly dangerous disease, Participants reported that the most common symptom is difficulty in breathing (89.4%) followed by fever (84.4%). Face shield was the most recommended personal protective equipment (PPE) during dental treatment (98.6%) followed by disposable gown (96.3%). The majority of participants (84.8%) recommended using 70% ethyl alcohol as the first method to disinfect surfaces in between dental visits, followed by sodium hypochlorite. CONCLUSIONS: Dental students and interns in Cairo, Egypt, have good knowledge and awareness about COVID-19 and the necessary precautions required to provide adequate dental treatment for the patients during the pandemic COVID-19; however, the importance of infection control should be highlighted for both clinical and preclinical dental students, to provide safe dental treatment to the patients as well as protection of the dentists and healthcare workers.","Sharaf, Rasha F.; Kabel, Nihal",Bull Natl Res Cent,102,1

It was found that the survival ratio of B. subtilis can be considerably affected by the field and duration. It was also found that the viability of bacillus decreases with the increase of the duration. In addition, the comparative survival ratio (CSR) of B. subtilis decreases to 35% even during a short duration as the applied field reaches an enough high value of more than 15 kV/cm. These indicated that the uniform field inactivated the viability of B. subtilis availability. Based on the inactivation effect of the applied field on the B. subtilis, the effectiveness of charged polypropylene films on the inactivation of B. subtilis was measured and discussed.","Bu, Dan; Liu, Yingyan; Zhou, Yuanxiang; Xu, Zhe; Guo, Lixin; Zhang, Baile; Liang, Xidong; Guan, Zhicheng",J Electrostat,102,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional internet-based survey was completed by 706 pregnant women (mean age 29.6 years ± 3.2) residing in the United States in May 2020 to assess self-reported changes in diet, physical activity, and sleep during the COVID-19 pandemic. Logistic regression analyses examined whether sociodemographic, clinical, and pandemic-related characteristics were associated with health behavior changes. RESULTS: Approximately 17% of women reported their diets worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic, 42% reported improvements, and 41% reported no change. For physical activity, 22% reported they stopped being active, 2% reported they became active, and 76% reported no change. Nearly one-third of participants reported getting less sleep. The factors consistently associated with adverse lifestyle changes (worse diet, stopped being active, and reduced sleep) were experiences of pregnancy complications, loss of income due to COVID-19, and changes in social connections due to COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion of pregnant women reported adverse lifestyle changes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Interventions during the pandemic to optimize health behaviors in pregnant women, especially among those with pregnancy complications, should address economic disadvantages and social support.","Whitaker, Kara M.; Hung, Peiyin; Alberg, Anthony J.; Hair, Nicole L.; Liu, Jihong",Midwifery,102,8

But it is now becoming clear that being male is also a factor. The epidemiological findings reported across different parts of the world indicated higher morbidity and mortality in males than females. While it is still too early to determine why the gender gap is emerging, this article point to several possible factors such as higher expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE 2; receptors for coronavirus) in male than female, sex-based immunological differences driven by sex hormone and X chromosome. Furthermore, a large part of this difference in number of deaths is caused by gender behavior (lifestyle), i.e., higher levels of smoking and drinking among men compared to women. Lastly, studies reported that women had more responsible attitude toward the Covid-19 pandemic than men. Irresponsible attitude among men reversibly affect their undertaking of preventive measures such as frequent handwashing, wearing of face mask, and stay at home orders.","Bwire, George M.",SN Compr Clin Med,102,21

It is unknown whether peripheral immunity is related to cognitive dysfunction in ALS patients. OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship between the peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets and the cognitive status in ALS patients. METHODS: Among 81 ALS patients, we compared the demographic, clinical, and peripheral levels of total T lymphocyte, CD4+ T lymphocyte, CD8+ T lymphocyte, B lymphocyte, and NK cell between those with cognitive impairment (ALS-ci) and those without (ALS-nci). The cognitive status was evaluated via the Chinese version of the Edinburgh cognitive and behavioral screen (ECAS). Significant predictors of cognitive impairment in univariate logistic regression analysis were further examined using multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: 39.5% of all ALS patients had cognitive impairment. The ALS-ci group had shorter education time, older age at both symptom onset and testing, longer disease duration, and lower levels of peripheral total, CD4+, and CD8+ T lymphocyte and B lymphocyte than the ALS-nci group. Frequency of behavioral impairment did not differ between the two groups. While parameters with significant differences identified by group comparison were also significant predictors of cognitive impairment in univariate logistic regression analysis except the level of B lymphocyte, only older age at testing, education time less than 9 years, and lower level of CD4+ T lymphocyte remained significant in multivariate logistic regression analysis. The predictive model combining these three parameters had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve value of 0.842 with a sensitivity of 90.6% and a specificity of 67.3%. CONCLUSION: In Chinese ALS patients, blood CD4+ T lymphocyte might help evaluate cognitive impairment along with age and education level.

Así pues, el objetivo del presente trabajo es revisar la literatura disponible al respecto y emitir algunas recomendaciones del papel que el COVID-19 ejerce sobre el hígado en la salud y la enfermedad. La incidencia de lesión hepática asociada específicamente a COVID-19 varía de 14.8-53%. La mayoría de las series de casos han reportado alteración en ALT y AST, elevación de bilirrubinas totales y albúmina sérica baja. La afectación hepática se asociado a casos más graves de COVID-19. Por otra parte, se reconoce que la cirrosis hepática es un estado de disfunción inmune que comprende inmunodeficiencia e inflamación sistémica, lo cual hace razonable que estos pacientes sean más susceptibles a la infección por SARS-COV-2. Las recomendaciones para estos pacientes además de las medidas generales para la población (aislamiento social, lavado de manos) incluyen el apoyo social, médico y psicológico durante el periodo de estancia en el domicilio para evitar transgresiones a la terapia.

Abstract The novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is responsible for the infectious disease caused by coronavirus 19 (COVID-19). The current pandemic is growing worldwide and could affect 50-60% of the world population in the months to come. The most severe disease manifestations are atypical pneumonia and sepsis, but the gastrointestinal tract, particularly the liver, has recently been reported to be affected by SARS-COV2. Therefore, the aim of the present work was to review the literature available on the topic and provide information about COVID-19, in both healthy and diseased livers, and issue recommendations. The incidence of liver injury specifically associated with COVID-19 varies from 14.8-53%. The majority of case series have reported altered ALT and AST, elevated total bilirubin, and low serum albumin and liver compromise has been associated with the most severe cases of COVID-19. Cirrhosis of the liver has a recognized immune dysfunction status that includes immunodeficiency and systemic inflammation, making it reasonable for those patients to be more susceptible to SARS-COV-2 infection. The recommendations for those patients, in addition to the general measures of physical distancing and handwashing for all persons, include social, medical, and psychologic support during the period of home quarantine to prevent lapses in treatment. Patients should be made aware that they need to keep abreast of changes in recommendations and social policies.","Velarde-Ruiz Velasco, J. A.; García-Jiménez, E. S.; Remes-Troche, J.

METHODS: To evaluate the epidemiologic characteristics of HAdV-ARI in the Korean military, we analyzed respiratory virus polymerase chain reaction (RV-PCR) results, pneumonia surveillance results, and severe HAdV cases from all 14 Korean military hospitals from January 2013 to May 2018 and compared these data with nationwide RV surveillance data for the civilian population. RESULTS: A total of 14,630 RV-PCRs was performed at military hospitals. HAdV (45.4%) was the most frequently detected RV, followed by human rhinovirus (12.3%) and influenza virus (6.3%). The percentage of the military positive for HAdV was significantly greater than the percentage of civilians positive for HAdV throughout the study period, with a large outbreak occurring during the winter to spring of 2014 to 2015. The outbreak continued until the end of the study, and non-seasonal detections increased over time. The reported number of pneumonia patients also increased during the outbreak.

AIM OF THE STUDY: To provide experimental data of clinical adaption of total indole alkaloids (TA) from leaf of A. scholaris for treating post-infectious cough in phase II clinical trial. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To model post-infectious cough, all animals except control group were instilled intra-tracheal with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (80 μg/50 µL/mouse), followed by subsequent exposure to cigarette smoke (CS) for 30 min per day for a total of 30 days. Mice were orally given TA at dose of 10, 25, 50 mg/kg, and four main alkaloids (Sch: scholaricine, Epi: 19-epischolaricine, Val: vallesamine, Pic: picrinine) once daily. Cellular infiltration was assessed in the broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) in the serum was determined, the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity as well as malondialdehyde (MDA) content in the serum and homogenate were examined. Finally, histopathological examination in the lungs was assessed by H. E. staining. RESULTS: After administration of TA and four major alkaloids respectively, the symptoms of cough in mice were obviously attenuated. Total white blood cells (WBC) and neutrophils (NEU) amounts in BALF were reduced obviously and the pathological damage of lung was also attenuated. There was also significant reduction in IL-6, CRP, MDA and a marked improvement in SOD. CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of indole alkaloids against post-infectious cough (PIC) was shown in the down-regulation of inflammatory cells, cytokines, and the balance of antioxidants. What's more, the pharmacological effects of TA were better than single indole alkaloid, which might be related to the synergic effect of four major alkaloids.","Zhao, Yun-Li; Yang, Zi-Feng; Shang, Jian-Hua; Huang, Wan-Yi; Wang, Bei; Wei, Xin; Khan, Afsar; Yuan, Zhi-Wei; Liu, Ya-Ping; Wang, Yi-Fen; Wang, Xin-Hua; Luo, Xiao-Dong",J Ethnopharmacol,102,21

Differences in how leaders address the pandemic through public messages have practical implications for building trust and an effective response within a country. METHODS: We analysed the speeches made by 20 heads of government around the world (Bangladesh, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Dominican Republic, Finland, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, New Zealand, Niger, Norway, Russia, South Africa, Scotland, Sint Maarten, United Kingdom, United States and Taiwan) to highlight the differences between men and women leaders in discussing COVID-19. We used an inductive analytical approach, coding speeches for specific themes based on language and content. FINDINGS: Five primary themes emerged across a total of 122 speeches on COVID-19, made by heads of government: economics and financial relief, social welfare and vulnerable populations, nationalism, responsibility and paternalism, and emotional appeals. While all leaders described the economic impact of the pandemic, women spoke more frequently about the impact on the individual scale. Women leaders were also more often found describing a wider range of social welfare services, including: mental health, substance abuse and domestic violence. Both men and women from lower-resource settings described detailed financial relief and social welfare support that would impact the majority of their populations. While 17 of the 20 leaders used war metaphors to describe COVID-19 and the response, men largely used these with greater volume and frequency. CONCLUSION: While this analysis does not attempt to answer whether men or women are more effective leaders in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, it does provide insight into the rhetorical tools and types of language used by different leaders during a national and international crisis. This analysis provides additional evidence on the differences in political leaders’ messages and priorities to inspire citizens’ adhesion to the social contract in the adoption of response and recovery measures. However, it does not consider the influence of contexts, such as the public audience, on leaders’ strategic communication approaches.","Dada, Sara; Ashworth, Henry Charles; Bewa, Marlene Joannie; Dhatt, Roopa",BMJ Glob Health,102,22

Participants attend quarterly visits with behavioral surveys and HIV/STI testing. In April 2020, we implemented an additional survey to measure the impact of COVID-19 on sexual behavior. Our analysis compared participants’ reported sexual behavior during two periods: April-July 2020 (T1) and August-December 2020 (T2).ResultsOf the 200 participants who completed at least one COVID-19 survey in either time period, 10 (5%) self-reported a previous COVID-19 diagnosis. We compared behaviors reported by 174 respondents who submitted surveys in both time periods. During T1, about half (46%) said they felt more anxious about sex since COVID-19;anxiety was similar during T2 (43%). Many reported engaging in online sexual activities, though we saw no meaningful differences by time period for starting or increasing chatting on hookup apps (T1=30%, T2=30%), sexting (T1=30%, T2=25%), or video chat sex (T1=16%, T2=14%). Watching pornography was reported more often in T1 than T2 (53% vs. 42%). Nearly a third of respondents (30%) in T1 reported that they were not having sex;this decreased to 17% in T2.

Indigenous peoples understand their world as populated by powerful human and nonhuman beings; for them, the moral duty of achieving happiness and abundance for all implies sustaining reciprocal and respectful relations with these beings (including the State). In contrast Colombian environmental policy distinguishes between nature and culture, seeking to safeguard landscapes from human interference so that natural processes can unfold unhindered. In practice these partially connected, yet incommensurable worldviews make for a ‘perfect storm’ - opening opportunities for illegal mining. Drawing on recent fieldwork among the Andoke, an ethnic group well acquainted with extractivism in its different historical modalities and presently affronting the fallout of gold dredge mining we narrate how a parallel, non-state governance system makes it difficult for them to care for their land and entertain mutual and respectful relations with human and nonhuman beings (which we translate as ‘territorial health’). We conclude by arguing for the need to re-imagine environmental governance in ways that more closely engage with what we call pluriversal governance: a form of (environmental) governance that does ontological justice to those involved in the environmental conflict – including, crucially, Indigenous people.","Torres, Camilo; Verschoor, Gerard",Geoforum,102,20

METHODS: Blood and nasopharyngeal washings from children <3 years of age with viral LRTI attending a hospital were collected within 24 hours (acute) and after 4–6 weeks (recovery). Patients were assigned to a mild (observation only), moderate (supplemental oxygen and/or nasogastric feeding) or severe (mechanical ventilation) group. Linear regression analysis was used to design a prediction rule using plasma levels of C reactive protein (CRP), serum amyloid A (SAA), pentraxin 3 (PTX3), serum amyloid P component and properdin. This rule was tested in a validation cohort. RESULTS: One hundred and four children (52% male) were included. A combination of CRP, SAA, PTX3 and properdin was a better indicator of severe disease compared with any of the individual makers and age (69% sensitivity (95% CI 50 to 83), 90% specificity (95% CI 80 to 96)). Validation in 141 patients resulted in 71% sensitivity (95% CI 53 to 85), 87% specificity (95% CI 79 to 92), negative predictive value of 64% (95% CI 47 to 78) and positive predictive value of 90% (95% CI 82 to 95). The prediction rule was not able to identify patients with a mild course of disease. CONCLUSION: A combination of CRP, SAA, PTX3 and properdin was able to identify children with a severe course of viral LRTI disease, even in children under 2 months of age. To assess the true impact on clinical management, these results should be validated in a prospective randomised control study.","Ahout, Inge M L; Brand, Kim H; Zomer, Aldert; van den Hurk, Wilhelma H; Schilders, Geurt; Brouwer, Marianne L; Neeleman, Chris; de Groot, Ronald; Ferwerda, Gerben",BMJ Open,102,13

The burden of influenza is very heavy. Indeed, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that annual epidemics affect 5-15% of the world's population, causing up to 4-5 million severe cases and from 250,000 to 500,000 deaths. In order to design anti-influenza molecules and compounds, it is important to understand the complex replication cycle of the influenza virus. Replication is achieved through various stages. First, the virus must engage the sialic acid receptors present on the free surface of the cells of the respiratory tract. The virus can then enter the cells by different routes (clathrin-mediated endocytosis or CME, caveolae-dependent endocytosis or CDE, clathrin-caveolae-independent endocytosis, or macropinocytosis). CME is the most usual pathway; the virus is internalized into an endosomal compartment, from which it must emerge in order to release its nucleic acid into the cytosol. The ribonucleoprotein must then reach the nucleus in order to begin the process of translation of its genes and to transcribe and replicate its nucleic acid. Subsequently, the RNA segments, surrounded by the nucleoproteins, must migrate to the cell membrane in order to enable viral assembly. Finally, the virus must be freed to invade other cells of the respiratory tract. All this is achieved through a synchronized action of molecules that perform multiple enzymatic and catalytic reactions, currently known only in part, and for which many inhibitory or competitive molecules have been studied. Some of these studies have led to the development of drugs that have been approved, such as Amantadine, Rimantadine, Oseltamivir, Zanamivir, Peramivir, Laninamivir, Ribavirin and Arbidol. This review focuses on the influenza lifecycle and on the currently available drugs, while potential antiviral compounds for the prevention and treatment of influenza are considered in the subsequent review.","GASPARINI, R.; AMICIZIA, D.; LAI, PL.; BRAGAZZI, NL.; PANATTO, D.",J Prev Med Hyg,102,12

Glycyrrhizin is widely used to cure allergic diseases due to its medicinal properties. In the present study, we evaluated the role of glycyrrhizin on lipid peroxidation and antioxidant status in the blood and nasal mucosa of allergic rhinitis (AR) mice. Mice were divided into six groups: normal control mice, model control (MC) mice, three glycyrrhizin-treated mice groups and lycopene-treated mice. Sensitization-associated increase in lipid peroxidation was observed in the blood and nasal mucosa of MC mice. Activities of antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), total antioxidant capacity (TAOC) and levels of glutathione (GSH) were found to be significantly decreased in the blood and nasal mucosa in MC mice when compared to normal control mice. However, normalized lipid peroxidation and antioxidant defenses were reported in the glycyrrhizin-treated and lycopene-treated mice. Moreover, glycyrrhizin treatment still enhanced IFN-γ and reduced IL-4 levels in glycyrrhizin-treated mice.

Coronavirus has infected over 38.3 million people and caused millions of deaths worldwide. The COVID-19 outbreak has accentuated the need for additional efforts to develop broad-spectrum therapeutics to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the current investigation, an attempt was made to design potential SARS-CoV PLpro inhibitors containing naphthalene and 3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran moieties connected via -NHCO- linker. The ligands obeyed Lipinski's rule and were found to have good drug-likeness and ADMET properties. Docking simulations confirmed strong binding affinity and inhibition potential of the designed ligands against the receptor SARS CoV-2 Papain-like protease (PLpro). LigandL10 incorporating the oxadiazole ring system displayed better binding affinity than the control 5-acetamido-2-methyl-N-[(1R)-1-naphthalen-1-ylethyl]benzamide. Further, the docked complex of LigandL10 was subjected to molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to examine the molecular mechanisms of protein-ligand interactions.

On the donor side, infection concerns resulted in a dramatic reduction in donor lung offers and raised the specter of viral transmission to procurement team members. On the recipient side, the need for pre-transplant COVID-19 testing and COVID free patient care units presented unprecedented logistical challenges. New indications for ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) also emerged, including logistics (e.g. providing adequate time for recipient COVID testing), and donor lung evaluation following 3rd party procurement. In this study, we defined the novel roles of EVLP that our LTx program developed during the COVI-19 pandemic. Methods Retrospective analysis of adult LTx procedures performed at our institute from March 17th (when COVID restrictions began at our institute) through May 31st 2020, compared to LTx performed during the same period in 2019. Results During the study period, 17 LTx were performed. Eight of 17 were performed after EVLP evaluation, and 6 with EVLP back-up. Notably, the number of LTx after EVLP doubled vs. the same period in 2019, and the number of LTx cases with EVLP backup tripled (Figure 1A). Indications for EVLP in 4 LTx cases and 4 cases with EVLP backup were unique to pandemic conditions (Figure 1B). To date, no patients transplanted during this period, or team members tested positive for COVID-19, or are suspected of COVID infection post-LTx. 30-day survival was 100%, and incidence of primary graft dysfunction grades 0, 1, 2, and 3 at 72 hours post-transplant were 39%, 52%, 4%, and 4%, respectively. Median ventilation duration was 1 day. Conclusion Maintaining LTx activity with EVLP was feasible in the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. EVLP enabled our team to solve challenges with donor evaluation and logistics. By enabling donor assessment after local procurement, EVLP also increased the procurement team's safety. In the future, these newer EVLP indications may be applicable beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ayyat, K. S.; Okamoto, T.; Sakanoue, I.; Elgharably, H.; Budev, M. M.; Yun, J. J.; McCurry, K.

We conducted this meta‐analysis to explore the prevalence of cardiovascular comorbidities in COVID‐19, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) cases. METHODS AND RESULTS: Relevant reports updated to April 17, 2020, were searched from PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library with no restriction on language. A random‐effects model was used in this meta‐analysis to obtain pooled proportions of cardiovascular comorbidities in COVID‐19, SARS, and MERS. A total of 22 studies (12 for COVID‐19, 4 for SARS, and 6 for MERS) were included in this analysis, and the average age of patients with COVID‐19, SARS, and MERS was 46.41±1.79, 39.16±2.25, and 52.51±4.64 years, respectively. Proportions of cardiovascular comorbidities in coronavirus diseases were as follows: COVID‐19: proportion of hypertension was 17.1% (95% CI, 13.2%–20.9%), proportion of cardiac disease was 4.5% (95% CI, 3.6%–5.5%) and proportion of diabetes mellitus was 8.5% (95% CI, 5.5%–11.4%); SARS: proportion of hypertension was 4.5% (95% CI, 2.0%–7.0%), proportion of cardiac disease was 2.1% (95% CI, 0.6%–3.7%) and proportion of diabetes mellitus was 3.7% (95% CI, 1.0%–6.4%); MERS: proportion of hypertension was 30.3% (95% CI, 18.3%–42.2%), proportion of cardiac disease was 20.9% (95% CI, 10.7%–31.1%), and proportion of diabetes mellitus was 45.4% (95% CI, 27.3%–63.5%).

Here, we report that induced mild pulmonary morbidities rendered SARS-CoV-2–refractive CD-1 mice susceptible to this virus. Specifically, SARS-CoV-2 infection after application of low doses of the acute lung injury stimulants bleomycin or ricin caused severe disease in CD-1 mice, manifested by sustained body weight loss and mortality rates greater than 50%. Further studies revealed markedly higher levels of viral RNA in the lungs, heart, and serum of low-dose ricin–pretreated mice compared with non-pretreated mice. Furthermore, lung extracts prepared 2–3 days after viral infection contained subgenomic mRNA and virus particles capable of replication only when derived from the pretreated mice. The deleterious effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection were effectively alleviated by passive transfer of polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies generated against the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD). Thus, viral cell entry in the sensitized mice seems to depend on viral RBD binding, albeit by a mechanism other than the canonical ACE2-mediated uptake route. This unique mode of viral entry, observed over a mildly injured tissue background, may contribute to the exacerbation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pathologies in patients with preexisting morbidities.","Falach, Reut; Bar-On, Liat; Lazar, Shlomi; Kadar, Tamar; Mazor, Ohad; Aftalion, Moshe; Gur, David; Evgy, Yentl; Shifman, Ohad; Aminov, Tamar; Israeli, Ofir; Cohen-Gihon, Inbar; Zaide, Galia; Gutman, Hila; Vagima, Yaron; Makdasi, Efi; Stein, Dana; Rosenfeld, Ronit; Alcalay, Ron; Zahavy, Eran; Levy, Haim; Glinert, Itai; Ben-Shmuel, Amir; Israely, Tomer; Melamed, Sharon; Politi, Boaz; Achdout, Hagit; Yitzhaki, Shmuel; Kronman, Chanoch; Sabo, Tamar",JCI insight,102,16

Curbing the spread of COVID-19 and future pandemics may be accomplished through understanding the environmental context of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and adoption of effective detection tools and mitigation policies. This article aims to examine the latest investigations on SARS-CoV-2 plausible environmental transmission modes, employment of wastewater surveillance for early detection of COVID-19, and elucidating the role of solid waste, water, and atmospheric quality on viral infectivity. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via faecal-oral or bio-aerosols lacks robust evidence and remains debatable. However, improper disinfection and defected plumbing systems in indoor environments such as hospitals and high-rise towers may facilitate the transport of virus-laden droplets of wastewater causing infection. Clinical and epidemiological studies are needed to present robust evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is transmissible via aerosols, though quantification of virus-laden aerosols at low concentrations presents a challenge. Wastewater surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 can be an effective tool in early detection of outbreak and determination of COVID-19 prevalence within a population, complementing clinical testing and providing decision makers guidance on restricting or relaxing movement. While poor air quality increases susceptibility to diseases, evidence for air pollution impact on COVID-19 infectivity is not available as infections are dynamically changing worldwide. Solid waste generated by households with infected individuals during the lockdown period may facilitate the spread of COVID-19 via fomite transmission route but has received little attention from the scientific community. Water bodies receiving raw sewage may pose risk of infection but this has not been investigated to date. Overall, our understanding of the environmental perspective of SARS-CoV-2 is imperative to detecting outbreak and predicting pandemic severity, allowing us to be equipped with the right tools to curb any future pandemic.","Al Huraimel, Khalid; Alhosani, Mohamed; Kunhabdulla, Shabana; Stietiya, Mohammed Hashem",Sci Total Environ,102,10

SARS-CoV-2 can result in overactivity or suppression of the innate immune system. A dysregulated immune response is associated with poor outcomes; with patients having significant Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte ratios (NLR) due to neutrophilia alongside lymphopenia. Elevated interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 leads to overactivity and is a prominent feature of severe COVID-19 patients. IL-6 can result in lymphopenia; where COVID-19 patients typically have significantly altered lymphocyte subsets. IL-8 attracts neutrophils; which may play a significant role in lung tissue damage with the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps leading to cytokine storm or acute respiratory distress syndrome. Several factors like pre-existing co-morbidities, genetic risks, viral pathogenicity, and therapeutic efficacy act as important modifiers of SARS-CoV-2 risks for disease through an interplay with innate host inflammatory responses.

However, many clinical reports have listed different neurological symptoms, leading to increased interest in the neurological involvement of COVID-19. Various pathophysiological mechanisms have been proposed to explain these neurological aspects. Direct viral invasion of the nervous system, systemic cytokine storm and severe hypoxemia are key factors in the development of symptoms. Critically ill patients present several additional risk factors for nervous system damage. Reasons for these include deep sedation and extended muscular paralysis, bed rest for several days, and the inability to receive proper physical rehabilitation. After ICU treatment, COVID-19 patients generally require an extensive rehabilitation program.

This article reviews the aspects of the pathophysiology of the disease that have an impact on the infectivity of the body's tissues and fluids, measures for preventing biological risk, taking samples and pathological findings, both macroscopic and microscopic, associated with death caused by infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus.","Bañon-Gonzalez, Rafael; Carnicero-Caceres, Silvia; Suarez-Mier, M.

Recent increases in both asthma and obesity among youth have led to high health care utilization, increased health related complications, and expanded risks of subsequent cardiovascular disease burden. Common symptoms seen with asthma and obesity include fatigue, pain, depression, and anxiety. These symptoms can result in decreased physical activity, social isolation, and poor quality of life, which also may contribute to increased morbidity and mortality over time. Youth ages 10–17 are in a transitionary period where their overall health and disease management shifts from one of parental oversight to one where the youth gradually experience increased autonomy over their health and care management. Managing Asthma and Obesity Related Symptoms (MATADORS), is a mHealth technology-enhanced nurse-guided intervention that incorporates a novel mobile health application and motivational enhancement principles within a behavioral activation framework. Providing high-risk youth with strategies to enhance symptom self-management may result in decreased symptom prevalence, improved quality of life, and long-term reduction of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality as they move into adulthood. Moreover, developing low-cost, scalable tools with end-user input may facilitate promote early intervention and improved access to care, and reduce overall disease burden and healthcare costs.","Nichols, Michelle; Teufel, Ronald; Miller, Sarah; Madisetti, Mohan; Giovanni, Christine San; Chike-Harris, Katherine; Jones, Lacy; Prentice, Margaret; Ruggiero, Kenneth; Kelechi, Teresa",Int J Environ Res Public Health,102,22

Bearing the largest single-stranded RNA genomes in nature, coronaviruses are critically dependent on long-distance RNA-RNA interactions to regulate the viral transcription and replication pathways. Here we experimentally mapped the in vivo RNA-RNA interactome of the full-length SARS-CoV-2 genome and subgenomic mRNAs. We uncovered a network of RNA-RNA interactions spanning tens of thousands of nucleotides. These interactions reveal that the viral genome and subgenomes adopt alternative topologies inside cells, and engage in different interactions with host RNAs. Notably, we discovered a long-range RNA-RNA interaction - the FSE-arch - that encircles the programmed ribosomal frameshifting element. The FSE-arch is conserved in the related MERS-CoV and is under purifying selection. Our findings illuminate RNA structure based mechanisms governing replication, discontinuous transcription, and translation of coronaviruses, and will aid future efforts to develop antiviral strategies.","Ziv, Omer; Price, Jonathan; Shalamova, Lyudmila; Kamenova, Tsveta; Goodfellow, Ian; Weber, Friedemann; Miska, Eric A.",Mol Cell,102,1

In this international, multi-center study conducted by the World Alliance Societies of Echocardiography (WASE), we aim to determine the clinical and echocardiographic phenotype of acute cardiac disease in COVID-19 patients, to explore phenotypic differences in different geographic regions across the world, and to identify parameters associated with in-hospital mortality. Methods We studied 870 patients with acute COVID-19 infection from 13 medical centers in four world regions (Asia, Europe, United States, Latin America) who had undergone transthoracic echocardiograms (TTEs). Clinical and laboratory data were collected, including patient outcomes. Anonymized echocardiograms were analyzed with automated, machine learning-derived algorithms to calculate left ventricular (LV) volumes, ejection fraction (EF), and LV longitudinal strain (LS). Right-sided echocardiographic parameters that were measured included right ventricular (RV) LS, RV free wall strain (FWS), and RV basal diameter (RVBD). Multivariate regression analysis was performed to identify clinical and echocardiographic parameters associated with in-hospital mortality. Results Significant regional differences were noted in terms of patient co-morbidities, severity of illness, clinical biomarkers, and LV and RV echocardiographic metrics. Overall in-hospital mortality was 21.6%. Parameters associated with mortality in a multivariate analysis were age (OR 1.12 [1.05, 1.22], p = 0.003), previous lung disease (OR 7.32 [1.56, 42.2], p = 0.015), LVLS (OR 1.18 [1.05, 1.36], p = 0.012), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) (OR 6.17 [1.74, 28.7], p = 0.009), and RVFWS (OR 1.14 [1.04, 1.26], p = 0.007). Conclusions LV dysfunction is noted in approximately 20% and RV dysfunction in approximately 30% of patients with acute COVID-19 illness and portend a poor prognosis. Age at presentation, previous lung disease, LDH, LVLS, and RVFWS were independently associated with in-hospital mortality.

Conjugating Purified Protein Derivative (PPD) onto tumour cells and injecting into BCG primed mice was found to enhance anti-tumour immune response. We had proposed earlier that in vitro activated autologous anti-tumour T-cells bearing Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) II on their surface, if pulsed with PPD and re-infused in a BCG – primed patient, can activate PPD – specific helper T-cells and the focused secretion of lymphokines like the IL-2 can selectively amplify the antitumor T-cell response by their proliferation and activation in a specific manner bypassing the suppression exerted by the anti-idiotypic and suppressor cells. The prime – boost strategy with the BCG–PPD system can also be applied to the immunoprophylaxis and immunotherapy of COVID-19. The autologous anti-Corona virus B and T lymphocytes can be activated in vitro by inactivated virus or mitogens like Concanavalin A to express MHC class II molecules on their surface and pulsed with PPD for carrier targeting in vivo. Such PPD – pulsed activated (MHC-II+ve) anti-viral lymphocytes if transfused back into a patient already vaccinated with BCG during childhood or primed with BCG during adulthood 2 weeks before transfusion, could lead to a high magnitude of selective in vivo amplification of specific anti-viral lymphocytes, which can mount adequate and appropriate immune response to get rid of the virus and cure the patient from COVID-19. Conjugating antigens to PPD and injecting into BCG primed humans may also be helpful for immunoprophylaxis against COVID-19.

The following reports our experience of a Gynaecologic Oncology Unit's reallocation of resources in a COVID-19 free surgical oncologic hub in order to guarantee standard quality of surgical activities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a prospective observational study performed in the Gynaecologic Oncology Unit, on the outcomes of the reallocation of surgical activities outside the University Hospital of Bologna, Italy, during the Italian lockdown period. Here, we described our COVID-19 free surgical oncologic pathway, in terms of lifestyle restrictions, COVID-19 screening measures, and patient clinical, surgical and follow up outcomes. RESULTS: During the lockdown period (March 9th – May 4th, 2020), 83 patients were scheduled for oncological surgery, 51 patients underwent surgery. Compared to pre-COVID period, we performed the same activities: number of cases scheduled for surgery, type of surgery and surgical and oncological results. No cases of COVID-19 infection were recorded in operated patients and in medical staff. Patients were compliant and well accepted the lifestyle restrictions and reorganization of the care.

As the etiological coronavirus (a.k.a. SARS-CoV2) may putatively have a bat origin, our understanding about its intermediate reservoir between bats and humans, especially its tropism in wild and domestic animals are mostly unknown. This constitutes major concerns in public health for the current pandemics and potential zoonosis. Previous reports using structural analysis of the viral spike protein (S) binding its cell receptor of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), indicate a broad potential of SARS-CoV2 susceptibility in wild and particularly domestic animals. Through integration of key immunogenetic factors, including the existence of S-binding-void ACE2 isoforms and the disparity of ACE2 expression upon early innate immune response, we further refine the SARS-CoV2 susceptibility prediction to fit recent experimental validation. In addition to showing a broad susceptibility potential across mammalian species based on structural analysis, our results also reveal that domestic animals including dogs, pigs, cattle and goats may evolve ACE2-related immunogenetic diversity to restrict SARS-CoV2 infections. Thus, we propose that domestic animals may be unlikely to play a role as amplifying hosts unless the virus has further species-specific adaptation. Findings may relieve relevant public concerns regarding COVID-19-like risk in domestic animals, highlight virus-host coevolution, and evoke disease intervention through targeting ACE2 molecular diversity and interferon optimization.","Sang, Eric R.; Tian, Yun; Gong, Yuanying; Miller, Laura C.; Sang, Yongming",Heliyon,102,1

There are more than 200 ongoing trials on different drugs or vaccines, but new medications may take until 2021 to develop. Defining the optimal number of patients to be included in a study is a considerable challenge in these interventional researches. Ethical considerations prompt researchers to minimize the number of patients included in a trial. This gains particular importance when the disease is rare or lethal which is particularly so in the case of COVID-19. It is of paramount importance to explore some of the available tools that could help accelerate the adoption of any or some of the many proposed modalities for the treatment of diseases. These tools should be effective, yet efficient, for rapid testing of such treatments. Sequential analysis has not been frequently used in many clinical trials where it should have been used. None of the authors in published literature, as far as we know, used sequential analysis techniques to test potential drugs for COVID-19. In addition to its usefulness when the results of new forms of treatment are quickly needed, other important benefit of sequential analysis includes the ability to reach a similar conclusion about the utility of a new drug without unduly exposing more patients to the side effect of the old drug, in particularly, for the treatment of a rare disease.","El Taguri, Adel; NASEF, Aisha",The Libyan journal of medicine,102,24

To offer a better understanding for an implementation of multidisciplinary policies in COVID-19 control, we compared the impact of NPIs by assessing the transmissibility and severity of COVID-19 in different phases of the epidemic during the first five months in WPR. In this study, we estimated the piecewise instantaneous reproduction number (R(t)) and the reporting delay-adjusted case-fatality ratio (dCFR) of COVID-19 in seven WPR jurisdictions: Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Japan, Malaysia, Shanghai, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan. According to the results, implementing NPIs was associated with an apparent reduction of the piecewise R(t) in two epidemic waves in general. However, large cluster outbreaks raised the piecewise R(t) to a high level. We also observed relaxing the NPIs could result in an increase of R(t). The estimated dCFR ranged from 0.09% to 1.59% among the jurisdictions, except in Japan where an estimate of 5.31% might be due to low testing efforts. To conclude, in conjunction with border control measures to reduce influx of imported cases which might cause local outbreaks, other NPIs including social distancing measures along with case finding by rapid tests are also necessary to prevent potential large cluster outbreaks and transmissions from undetected cases. A comparatively lower CFR may reflect the health system capacity of these jurisdictions. In order to keep track of sustained disease transmission due to resumption of economic activities, a close monitoring of disease transmissibility is recommended in the relaxation phase.

The purpose of this study was to assess how flipped classrooms affect the acquisition of knowledge in clinical dental education based on multilevel factor analysis. METHOD: The authors conducted a 3-year (2017, 2018, and 2019) randomized controlled trial in a series of introductory prosthodontics courses in dental education. A total of 137 participants were randomly assigned to flipped classroom (n = 70, 51%) or lecture (n = 67, 49%) formats. The flipped group was instructed to self-learn knowledge-based content through online preparation materials, including videos and text, while the lecture group was given text only. Both groups were provided with the same study content and opportunities for different styles of learning. The session attendance rate and number of times the materials were accessed were monitored. Individual and team readiness assurance tests (IRAT/TRAT) were conducted to evaluate knowledge acquisition. A multilevel linear regression analysis was conducted on both instructional styles (flipped vs. lecture) as an intervention factor, and confounding factors that could affect the outcomes were implemented. RESULTS: The average number of online accesses was 2.5 times per session in the flipped group and 1.2 in the lecture group, with a significant difference (p < .05). The average IRAT score was significantly higher in the flipped than in the lecture group (effect size [ES] 0.58, p < .001). The number of online accesses was significantly and positively correlated with IRAT scores (0.6 [0.4, 0.8]). The instructional style was significantly and positively correlated with TRAT scores (coefficient [95% confidence interval]: 4.6 [2.0, 7.3]), but it was not correlated with IRAT (4.3 [-0.45, 9.0]). CONCLUSIONS: The flipped classroom was more effective than the lecture format regarding knowledge acquisition; however, the decisive factor was not the instructional style but the number of individual learning occasions. The employment of the flipped classroom was the decisive factor for team-based learning outcomes.","Wang, Zuo; Kohno, Eiko Yoshida; Fueki, Kenji; Ueno, Takeshi; Inamochi, Yuka; Takada, Kazuki; Wakabayashi, Noriyuki",PLoS One,102,1

We present a case of BrS unmasked by fever secondary to COVID-19 infection. CASE PRESENTATION: 38-year-old male with no prior medical history presented with a two-day history of subjective fevers, chills, productive cough, dyspnea, and left-sided pleuritic chest pain. He was noted to be febrile, tachypneic, tachycardic and hypoxic to the low-90s on room air. Bloodwork revealed elevated inflammatory markers with leukocytosis. Imaging and bloodwork were consistent with severe bilateral multifocal pneumonia secondary to COVID-19 infection. EKG on admission showed evidence of sinus tachycardia and type I Brugada pattern in leads V1 and V2 without ischemic changes. He was admitted for treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia with intravenous (IV) Remdesivir, IV steroids, and oxygen supplementation. Despite this, patient continued to be febrile, and interestingly, serial EKGs showed persistent type 1 Brugada pattern, which transformed into type 2 Brugada pattern after day 2 of admission, to persist for the next seven days. Echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular systolic function (ejection fraction 65%) with no significant valvular abnormalities. The Brugada pattern was thought to be induced by the febrile episodes, therefore all fevers were aggressively treated, and patient was closely monitored for any ventricular arrhythmias. Patient was educated on avoiding tricyclic antidepressants and sodium channel blockers as they are contraindicated in BrS. He was discharged home with plans for outpatient electrophysiological study. DISCUSSION: BrS is a clinical entity that can lead to sudden cardiac death and is associated with ECG changes of a 2mm J-point elevation and 1mm ST-segment elevation in two or more of the right precordial leads;type 1 is characterized by coveted-ST elevation in V1 and V2 whereas type 2 involves a saddle-back appearance. Diagnosis is made after excluding all other known causes of ST-segment elevation in right precordial leads, known as phenocopies. Known triggers include fever, intoxication, vagal stimulation, electrolyte imbalances, and various medications. Fever-induced BrS is more common among men in an age group of 30 to 60 years [4], it can precipitate cardiac arrest due to increased arrhythmogenicity of cardiac sodium channels at higher temperatures. Thus, timely and aggressive control of fever is crucial in preventing fatal arrhythmias, with fever-induced BrS leading to cardiac arrest in 18-20% of patients [2,3]. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians need to be aware of the circumstances that can induce BrS, including fevers and medications, as BrS can be fatal, leading to cardiac arrest in many patients. Early recognition can lead to early intervention, through placement of an implantable pacemaker for documented arrhythmia, to decrease morbidity and mortality. REFERENCE #1: 1.

Limited information is available for characterizing epidemiological features and transmission patterns in the regions outside of Hubei Province. Detailed data on transmission at the individual level could be an asset to understand the transmission mechanisms and respective patterns in different settings. OBJECTIVE: To reconstruct infection events and transmission clusters of SARS-CoV-2 for estimating epidemiological characteristics at household and non-household settings, including super-spreading events, serial intervals, age- and gender-stratified risks of infection in China outside of Hubei Province. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: 9,120 confirmed cases reported online by 264 Chinese urban Health Commissions in 27 provinces from January 20 to February 19, 2020. A line-list database is established with detailed information on demographic, social and epidemiological characteristics. The infection events are categorized into the household and non-household settings. EXPOSURES: Confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Information about demographic characteristics, social relationships, travel history, timelines of potential exposure, symptom onset, confirmation, and hospitalization were extracted from online public reports. 1,407 infection events formed 643 transmission clusters were reconstructed. RESULTS: In total 34 primary cases were identified as super spreaders, and 5 household super-spreading events were observed. The mean serial interval is estimated to be 4.95 days (standard deviation: 5.24 days) and 5.19 days (standard deviation: 5.28 days) for households and non-household transmissions, respectively. The risk of being infected outside of households is higher for age groups between 18 and 64 years, whereas the hazard of being infected within households is higher for age groups of young (<18) and elderly (>65) people. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The identification of super-spreading events, short serial intervals, and a higher risk of being infected outside of households for male people of age between 18 and 64 indicate a significant barrier to the case identification and management, which calls for intensive non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g. cancellation of public gathering, limited access of public services) as the potential mitigation strategies.","Xu, Xiao-Ke; Liu, Xiao-Fan; Wang, Lin; Ali, Sheikh Taslim; Du, Zhanwei; Bosetti, Paolo; Cowling, Benjamin J.; Wu, Ye",medRxiv,102,20

In order to better understand evolutionary relationships among SARS coronaviruses (SCoVs) from different international regions, we performed phylogenetic comparisons of full-length genomic and protein sequences from 45 human SCoVs (including 12 from Taiwan) and two civet SCoVs. All the Taiwanese SARS-CoV strains which associated with nosocomial infection formed a monophyletic clade within the late phase of the SARS epidemic. This Taiwanese clade could be further divided into two epidemic waves. Taiwan SCoVs in the first wave clustered with three isolates from the Amoy Gardens housing complex in Hong Kong indicating their possible origin. Of the 45 human SCoVs, one isolate from Guangdong province, China, exhibited an extra 29-nucleotide fragment between Orf 10 and Orf 11—similar to the civet SCoV genome. Nucleotide and protein sequence comparisons suggested that all SCoVs of late epidemic came from human-to-human transmission, while certain SCoVs of early epidemic might have originated in animals.","Lan, Yu-Ching; Liu, Hsin-Fu; Shih, Yi-Ping; Yang, Jyh-Yuan; Chen, Hour-Young; Chen, Yi-Ming Arthur",Infect Genet Evol,102,2

Diffusion in the social network can be referred to spread of information among interconnected nodes or entities in a network. The rate and intensity of diffusion depend upon network topology and initialization of network parameters. Individual nodes act as source of motivation for others in the diffusion process. The epidemic model is one of the basic diffusion models that helps in analyzing the transmission of infectious disease from one person to another through social connections. This can be further generalized for other socially connected platforms involving information exchange. In our research, we have proposed a diffusion methodology for tracking the rate with which information spread over underlying social interaction structure, with variation in time and other social parameters. In addition to forward state transitions, recoverable transition is also proposed, which allows a node currently under influence of incoming information, to revert back to previous state of perception. The proposed model also assists in predicting the fraction of population getting diffused over real and large-scale complex network for specific temporal domain.","Kumar, Pawan; Sinha, Adwitiya",Soc Netw Anal Min,102,20

Telemedicine has the potential to overcome many of the difficulties in routine management. Herein, we present a structured protocol that can be used to remotely manage patients with MS, describing in detail the steps to be taken and exams needed at each stage. A working group was established which developed a tailored protocol that can be adapted to a variety of settings. The overall protocol consisted of 5 phases: enrolment, document sharing phase, pre-evaluation, virtual visit, and post-visit phase, which was divided into 14 individual steps. As of October 2020, 25 virtual visits have been carried out, all via Skype. The patient’s caregiver was present during visits and had an active role. The average duration of the virtual visit was 24 min, and that of the pre-visit and post-visit were around 15 min each. Overall satisfaction as rated by physicians was considered high (8.0 ± 0.5). Using the system usability scale (SUS), patients also favorably rated the virtual visit (96.6 ± 6.1). In 20% of cases, the virtual visit was not sufficient to provide adequate information and an in-person clinical visit was recommended.

These reactions are the first steps of N-linked glycan processing and are essential for proper folding and function of many glycoproteins. Because most viral envelope glycoproteins contain N-linked glycans, inhibition of ER α-glucosidases with derivatives of 1-deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) or castanospermine (CAST), two well-studied pharmacophores of α-glucosidase inhibitors, efficiently disrupts the morphogenesis of a broad spectrum of enveloped viruses. Moreover, both DNJ and CAST derivatives have been demonstrated to prevent the death of mice infected with several distinct flaviviruses and filoviruses and suppress the multiplication of several other species of viruses in infected animals. N-Butyl derivative of DNJ (NB-DNJ) and 6 O-bytanoyl prodrug of CAST (Bu-CAST) have been evaluated in human clinical trials for their antiviral activities against human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus, and there is an ongoing trial of treating dengue patients with Bu-CAST. This article summarizes the current status of ER α-glucosidase-targeted antiviral therapy and proposes strategies for development of more efficacious and specific ER α-glucosidase inhibitors as broad-spectrum, drug resistance-refractory antiviral therapeutics. These host function-targeted, broad-spectrum antiviral agents do not rely on time-consuming etiologic diagnosis, and should therefore be particularly promising in the management of viral hemorrhagic fever and respiratory tract viral infections, medical conditions that can be caused by many different enveloped RNA viruses, with a short window for medical intervention.","Chang, Jinhong; Block, Timothy M.; Guo, Ju-Tao",Antiviral Res,102,30

There was a statistically significant difference with associations regarding the COVID-19 brain scan group for: admission to ICU, greater severity of lung injuries, the use of a mechanical ventilator and sepsis. Statistical tendency was found for chronic renal failure and systemic arterial hypertension. Forty-percent of COVID-19 patients from the brain scan group were abnormal on brain CT and/or brain MRI (22.9% of the cases with bleeding or microbleeding, 8.6% with restricted diffusion lesions).

Moreover, a prediction-oriented segmentation (POS) technique combined with structural equation models (SEM) was utilized to reveal consumers’ probable hidden heterogeneous characteristics. The outcomes of the global model SEM analysis indicate that offline-online trust transference occurs in e-commerce, and the conveyed trust significantly influences satisfaction and consumers’ repeat purchase intention through satisfaction. Neuroticism also has significant positive effects on trust transfer in the global model. However, results in three subgroups generated by POS show heterogeneous characteristics that considerably differed from the global model test results.

Since new infections usually are not observed directly, it can only be estimated from delayed and potentially biased data. We estimated Rt using a model that mapped unobserved infections to observed test-positive cases, hospital admissions, and deaths with confirmed Covid-19, in seven regions of England over March through August 2020. We explored the sensitivity of Rt estimates of Covid-19 in England to different data sources, and investigated the potential of using differences in the estimates to track epidemic dynamics in population sub-groups. Our estimates of transmission potential varied for each data source. The divergence between estimates from each source was not consistent within or across regions over time, although estimates based on hospital admissions and deaths were more spatio-temporally synchronous than compared to estimates from all test-positives. We compared differences in Rt with the demographic and social context of transmission, and found the differences between Rt may be linked to biased representations of sub-populations in each data source: from uneven testing rates, or increasing severity of disease with age, seen via outbreaks in care home populations and changing age distributions of cases. We highlight that policy makers should consider the source populations of Rt estimates. Further work should clarify the best way to combine and interpret Rt estimates from different data sources based on the desired use.","Sherratt, K.; Abbott, S.; Meakin, S.; Hellewell, J.; Munday, J.

OBJECTIVE: Assess the impact of a patient-supporter diabetes management intervention on supporters’ engagement in patients’ diabetes care, support techniques, and caregiving experience. DESIGN: Multivariate regression models examined between-group differences in support-related measures observed as part of a larger trial randomizing participants to a dyadic intervention versus usual care. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 239 adults with type 2 diabetes and either A1c >8% or systolic blood pressure >160mmHg enrolled with a family supporter. INTERVENTION: Health coaches provided training on positive support techniques and facilitated self-management information sharing and goal-setting. MAIN MEASURES: Patient and supporter reports at baseline and 12 months of supporter roles in diabetes care and caregiving experience. RESULTS: At 12 months, intervention-assigned patients had higher odds of reporting increased supporter involvement in remembering medical appointments (AOR 2.74, 95% CI 1.44, 5.21), performing home testing (AOR 2.40, 95% CI 1.29, 4.46), accessing online portals (AOR 2.34, 95% CI 1.29, 4.30), deciding when to contact healthcare providers (AOR 2.12, 95% CI 1.15, 3.91), and refilling medications (AOR 2.10, 95% CI 1.14, 3.89), but not with attending medical appointments or with healthy eating and exercise.

RESULTS: Results supported the hypothesized relationships where inclusive leadership indicated significant inverse causal relationship with psychological distress and a positive causal relationship with psychological safety. Mediation effect of psychological safety was found significant, while the model explained 73.9% variance in psychological distress. CONCLUSION: Inclusive leadership, through its positive and supportive characteristics, can pave way for such mechanisms that improve the psychological safety of employees in the long run and curbs psychological distress. IMPACT: This is the first longitudinal study to examine the relationship between inclusive leadership and psychological distress in health care and also examines the mediating mechanism of psychology safety. There is scarcity of empirical research on factors that determine and affect behavioural mechanism of healthcare workers during traumatic events and crisis. Clinical leaders and healthcare policy makers must invest in and promote inclusive and supportive environment characterized with open and accessible leaders at workplace to improve psychological safety; it helps reduce levels of psychological distress.","Ahmed, Fawad; Zhao, Fuqiang; Faraz, Naveed Ahmad; Qin, Yuan Jian",J Adv Nurs,102,17
644913,644913,644913,The Last Plague or Before the Graying,12.552484,8.711539,2020,"Early reports showed high mortality from Covid-19; by contrast, the current outbreaks in the southern and western United States are associated with fewer deaths, raising hope that treatments have improved. However, in Texas for instance, 63% of diagnosed cases are currently under 50, compared to only 52% nationally in March-April. Current demographics in Arizona and Florida are similar. Therefore, whether decreasing Covid-19 mortality rates are a reflection of changing demographics or represent improvements in clinical care is unknown. We assessed outcomes over time in a single health system, accounting for changes in demographics and clinical factors. Methods We analyzed biweekly mortality rates for admissions between March 1 and June 20, 2020 in a single health system in New York City. Outcomes were obtained as of July 14, 2020. We included all hospitalizations with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 disease. Patients with multiple hospitalizations (N=157, 3.3%) were included repeatedly if they continued to have laboratory-confirmed disease. Mortality was defined as in-hospital death or discharge to hospice care. Based on prior literature, we constructed a multivariable logistic regression model to generate expected risk of death, adjusting for age; sex; self-reported race and ethnicity; body mass index; smoking history; presence of hypertension, heart failure, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, diabetes, cancer, chronic kidney disease, or pulmonary disease individually as dummy variables; and admission oxygen saturation, D-dimer, C reactive protein, ferritin, and cycle threshold for RNA detection. All data were obtained from the electronic health record. We then calculated the sum of observed and expected deaths in each two-week period and multiplied each period's observed/expected (O/E) risk by the overall average crude mortality to generate biweekly adjusted rates. We calculated Poisson control limits and indicated points outside the control limits as significantly different, following statistical process control standards. The NYU institutional review board approved the study and granted a waiver of consent. Results We included 4,689 hospitalizations, of which 4,661 (99.4%) had died or been discharged. The median age, and the proportion male or with any comorbidity decreased over time; median real-time PCR cycle threshold increased (indicating relatively less concentration of virus) (Table). For instance, median age decreased from 67 years in the first two weeks to 49 in the last two. Peak hospitalizations were during the fifth and sixth study weeks, which accounted for 40% of the hospitalizations. Median length of stay for patients who died or were discharged to hospice was 8 days (interquartile range, 4-16). Unadjusted mortality dropped each period, from 30.2% in the first two weeks to 3% in the last two weeks, with the last eight weeks being lower than the 95% control limits. Risk adjustment partially attenuated the mortality decline, but adjusted mortality rates in the second-to-last two weeks remained outside the control limits (Figure, Table). The O/E risk of mortality decreased from 1.07 (0.64-1.67) in the first two weeks to 0.39 (0.08-1.12) in the last two weeks. Discussion In this 16-week study of Covid-19 mortality at a single health system, we found that changes in demographics and severity of illness at presentation account for some, but not all, of the decrease in unadjusted mortality. Even after risk adjustment for a variety of clinical and demographic factors, mortality was significantly lower towards the end of the study period. Incremental improvements in outcomes are likely a combination of increasing clinical experience, decreasing hospital volume, growing use of new pharmacologic treatments (such as corticosteroids, remdesivir and anti-cytokine treatments), non-pharmacologic treatments (such as proning), earlier intervention, community awareness, and lower viral load exposure from increasing mask wearing and social distancing. It is also possible that earlier periods had a more virulent circulating strain. In summary, data from one health system suggest that Covid-19 remains a serious disease for high risk patients, but that outcomes may be improving.","Horwitz, Leora; Jones, Simon A.; Cerfolio, Robert J.; Francois, Fritz; Greco, Joseph; Rudy, Bret; Petrilli, Christopher M",,102,20

This survey further aims to help inform the rheumatology community about the changes in practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey included 26 questions distributed to University staff members across Egypt members of the Egyptian College of Rheumatology (ECR). It takes 5–10 min to fill out. The practice setting of participating rheumatologists included University Teaching Hospitals that are the main rheumatology and clinical immunology service providers for adults and children RD patients. There was an overall agreement across the country in the responses to the survey that took a median time of 7 min to fill in. Potential changes in rheumatology outpatient practice by staff members evolved since the COVID-19 pandemic. None of the university rheumatology staff members has prescribed chloroquine or HCQ to prevent or treat COVID-19 in a non-hospitalized patient who was not previously on it. Twenty-three recommended decrease/avoid NSAIDs if the RD patient had confirmed COVID-19 or symptoms. There is an agreement to the key emerging frontline role of rheumatologists in treating COVID-19. During the pandemic, RD cases requiring admission were dealt with by several modified strategies. The overall agreement among the different university rheumatology departments during such critical situation has provoked the ECR to consider providing provisional guidelines for dealing with RD patients during this global catastrophe.","Gheita, Tamer A.; Salem, Mohamed N.; Eesa, Nahla N.; Khalil, Noha M.; Gamal, Nada M.; Noor, Rasha Abdel; Moshrif, Abdel Hafeez; Shereef, Rawhya El; Ismail, Faten; Noshy, Nermeen; Fawzy, Rasha M.; Elshebini, Emad; Khalifa, Iman; Saadany, Hanan El; Tharwat, Samar; El-Najjar, Amany; Fattah, Yousra Abdel; Sallam, Rehab; El-Bahnasawy, Amany S.; Gharbia, Ola; Hassan, Eman; ElShanawany, Amira; Mohamed, Eman F.; Senara, Soha; Ismail, Mervat; Nasef, Samah I.; Abdalla, Ahmed M.; Elessawi, Dina; Fawzy, Samar M.; Alfadl, Esam Abu; Khalifa, Asmaa; Abaza, Nouran M.",Rheumatol Int,102,16

This study follows patients with bipolar disorder living in two geographically close cities (Cagliari and Tunis), but with different lockdown conditions: less severe in Tunis. Methods: Two cohorts were evaluated during lockdown (April 2020, t0) and 2 months later with lockdown lifted for a month (t1). Individuals were: over 18 years old without gender exclusion, BD I or II, in care for at least 1 year, received a clinical interview in the month before the start of the lockdown, stable clinically before the lockdown. The assessment was conducted by telephone by a psychiatrist or psychologist with good knowledge of patients. Diagnoses were made according to DSM-5 criteria. Depressive symptoms were collected through the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression; cut-off 14 indicative of depressive episode. Circadian rhythms were measured using the BRIAN scale. Results: Forty individuals in Cagliari (70%female, age 48.57 ± 11.64) and 30 in Tunis (53.3% Female, age 41.8 ± 13.22) were recruited. In Cagliari at t0 45% had depressive episodes against none in Tunis, a similar difference appeared at t1. At t0 and t1 the Cagliari sample had more dysfunctional scores in the overall BRIAN scale and in the areas of sleep, activities and social rhythms; no differences were found in nutrition, both samples had predominantly nocturnal rhythm. In Cagliari at t0 and t1, the depressive sub-group showed more dysfunctional scores in the BRIAN areas sleep, activity, and nutrition. However, the differences in biological rhythms resulted, through ANCOVA analysis, independent of the co-presence of depressive symptoms. Discussion: A rigid lockdown could expose people with BD to depressive relapse through dysregulation of biological rhythms. The return to more functional rhythms did not appear 1 month after lockdown. The rekindling of the pandemic and the restoration of new restrictive measures will prevent, at least in the short term, the beneficial effect of a return to normality of the two cohorts. This was a limited exploratory study; future studies with larger samples and longer observational time are needed to verify the hypothesis.","Carta, Mauro Giovanni; Ouali, Uta; Perra, Alessandra; Ben Cheikh Ahmed, Azza; Boe, Laura; Aissa, Amina; Lorrai, Stefano; Cossu, Giulia; Aresti, Alessandro; Preti, Antonio; Nacef, Fethi",Front Psychiatry,102,26

Vitamin D deficiency that can result in compromised immune response has also been linked with increased risk and increased morbidities associated with Covid-19. In the absence of large scale longitudinal studies that can determine the strength of association between vitamin deficiency and Covid-19, cross sectional studies of large cohorts of patients can be used. MATERIAL AND METHODS: : We have used the i2b2 patient's registry platform at the University of Florida Health center to generate a count of patients using the ICD 10 diagnoses codes for the period of 10/1/2015 – 6/30/2020. Logistic regression of the aggregates was used for the analysis. RESULTS: : Patients with vitamin D deficiency were 4.6 times more likely to be Covid-19 positive, as indicated by a COV19 ICD 10 diagnostic code, than patients with no deficiency (P-value<0.001). The association decreased slightly after adjusting for gender (with OR=4.58, p<0.001) and for malabsorption (with OR=4.46, p<0.001) respectively. The association decreased significantly but remained robust with P-value<0.001 after adjusting for race (with OR=3.76, p<0.001), periodontal disease status (with OR=3.64, p<0.001), diabetes (with OR=3.28, p<0.001) and obesity (with OR=2.27, p<0.001), respectively. In addition, patients with vitamin D deficiency were 5 times more likely to be infected with Covid-19 than patients with no deficiency after adjusting for age groups (OR=5.155, p<0.001).

This study explored the decision-making processes that women undertake when faced with an unintended pregnancy, the sources of information used to make their decisions and the factors that contribute to their seeking of informal sector abortion in Cape Town, South Africa. METHODS: We conducted 15 semi-structured in-depth interviews in English with women who had accessed an abortion outside of the formal health care sector. Women were recruited with the assistance of a community-based key informant. Data was analyzed using a thematic analysis approach. RESULTS: Participants were aware that abortions were legal and accessible in public clinics, however they were concerned that others would find out about their unintended pregnancy and abortion if they went to legal providers. Women were also concerned about judgment and mistreatment from providers during their care. Rather than seek care in the formal sector, women looked past concerns around the safety and effectiveness of informal sector abortions and often relied on their social networks for referrals to informal providers. CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight the decision-making processes employed by women when seeking abortion services in a setting where abortion is legal and demonstrate the role of institutional and societal barriers to safe abortion access. Abortion service delivery models should adapt to women’s needs to enhance the preferences and priorities of those seeking abortion care-including those who prefer facility-based care as well as those who might prefer self-managed medical abortions.","Harries, Jane; Daskilewicz, Kristen; Bessenaar, Tshegofatso; Gerdts, Caitlin",Reprod Health,102,20

Although official COVID-19 statistics in Mexico report almost exclusively in-hospital mortality events, excess out-of-hospital mortality has been identified in other countries, including one EMS study in Italy that showed a 58% increase. Additionally, EMS and hospital reports from several countries have suggested that silent hypoxemia—low oxygen saturation (SpO2) in the absence of dyspnea—is associated with COVID-19. It is unclear, however, how these phenomena can be generalized to LMICs. We assess how EMS data can be used in a sentinel capacity in Tijuana, a city on the Mexico-United States border with earlier exposure to COVID-19 than many LMIC settings. Methods In this observational study, we calculated numbers of weekly out-of-hospital deaths and respiratory cases seen by EMS in Tijuana, and estimate the difference between peak-epidemic rates and expected trends based on data from 2014-2019. Results were compared with official COVID-19 statistics, stratified by neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES), and examined for changing demographic or clinical features, including mean SpO2. Results An estimated 194.7 (95%CI: 135.5-253.9) excess out-of-hospital deaths events occurred during the peak window (April 14th-May 11th), representing an increase of 145% (70%-338%) compared to expected levels. During the same window, only 5 COVID-19-positive, out-of-hospital deaths were reported in official statistics. This corresponded with a rise in respiratory cases of 236.5% (100.7%-940.0%), and a drop in mean SpO2 to 77.7%, from 90.2% at baseline. The highest out-of-hospital death rates were observed in low-SES areas, although respiratory cases were more concentrated in high-SES areas. Conclusions EMS systems may play an important sentinel role in monitoring excess out-of-hospital mortality and other trends during the COVID-19 crisis in LMICs. Using EMS data, we observed increases in out-of-hospital deaths in Tijuana that were nearly threefold greater magnitude than increases reported in EMS data in Italy. Increased testing in out-of-hospital settings may be required to determine if excess mortality is being driven by COVID-19 infection, health system saturation, or patient avoidance of healthcare. We also found evidence of worsening rates of hypoxemia among respiratory patients seen by EMS, suggesting a possible rise in silent hypoxemia, which should be met with increased detection and clinical management efforts. Finally, we observed that social disparities in out-of-hospital death that warrant monitoring and amelioration.","Friedman, Joseph; Calderón-Villarreal, Alhelí; Bojorquez, Ietza; Hernández, Carlos Vera; Schriger, David L.; Hirashima, Eva Tovar",Ann Emerg Med,102,27

The most convenient explanation is that some, external factor changed the value of the basic reproduction number, r0; and there certainly are arguments for this. Other factors could, nonetheless, have played a role. This research attempts to reconcile the observed peak with the thresholds predicted by lockdown regimes similar to the one in force at the time. It contemplates the effect of two, different, hypothetical errors in the data: The first is that the true level of infection has been underestimated by a multiplicative factor, while the second is that of an imperceptible, pre-existing, immune fraction of the population. While it is shown that it certainly is possible to manufacture the perception of an early peak as extreme as the one observed, solely by way of these two phenomena, the values need to be fairly high. The phenomena would not, by any measure, be insignificant.

We assessed the relation between assets, financial stressors and probable depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Between 31 March 2020 and 13 April 2020, we surveyed a probability-based, nationally representative sample of US adults ages 18 and older using the COVID-19 and Life stressors Impact on Mental Health and Well-being survey (n=1441). We calculated the prevalence of probable depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (cut-off ≥10) and exposure to financial stressors by financial, physical and social assets categories (household income, household savings, home ownership, educational attainment and marital status). We estimated adjusted ORs and predicted probabilities of probable depression across assets categories and COVID-19 financial stressor exposure groups. RESULTS: We found that (1) 40% of US adults experienced COVID-19-related financial stressors during this time period; (2) low assets (OR: 3.0, 95% CI 2.1 to 4.2) and COVID-19 financial stressor exposure (OR: 2.8, 95% CI 2.1 to 3.9) were each associated with higher odds of probable depression; and (3) among persons with low assets and high COVID-19 financial stressors, 42.7% had probable depression; and among persons with high assets and low COVID-19 financial stressors, 11.1% had probable depression. Persons with high assets and high COVID-19 financial stressors had a similar prevalence of probable depression (33.5%) as persons with low assets and low COVID-19 financial stressors (33.5%). The more assets a person had, the lower the level of probable depression. CONCLUSION: Populations with low assets are bearing a greater burden of mental illness during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ettman, Catherine K; Abdalla, Salma M; Cohen, Gregory H; Sampson, Laura; Vivier, Patrick M; Galea, Sandro",J Epidemiol Community Health,102,24

Vaccinations are among the most effective way of preventing some infectious diseases. Discussions on vaccinations have increased due to the Covid-19 pandemic and there is an opportunity to give society correct information on vaccinations. Aim The aim of the study was to determine the opinions of pregnant women on vaccinations in pregnancy and childhood and the effect of the Covid-19 pandemic on these views. Methods The study was conducted as a cross-sectional study. The sample included 152 pregnant women. Data were collected through a 25-item online questionnaire created by the researchers. Results It was found in our study that 29.6% of pregnant women using forum websites exhibited hesitant attitudes towards vaccinations. The vaccine hesitancy rate was found to be high in pregnant women who said that their economic level was low and who worried about the risks of vaccination. The Covid-19 pandemic was reported to be the cause of a decrease in vaccine hesitancy in 28.9% of the participants. Conclusion The events surrounding the pandemic provided an opportunity to explain how pregnant women feel about vaccinations. Providing pregnant women with access to correct information from health workers may reduce the problem of trust, which is among the most important reasons for vaccine hesitancy.","Gencer, Hatice; Özkan, Sevgi; Vardar, Okan; Serçekuş, Pınar",Women Birth,102,13

Moreover, it has not been clarified whether children or teenagers could be considered a problem for SARS-CoV-2 diffusion or, on the contrary, whether parents and school workers play a greater role. The aims of this review are to discuss about children’s safety at school and the better strategies currently able to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection at school. MAIN AIM: Compared to adults, very few cases of COVID-19 were diagnosed in children, who generally suffered from an asymptomatic infection or a mild disease. Moreover, school closure is systematically associated with the development of problems involving students, teachers and parents, particularly among populations with poor resources. Although several researches have tried to evaluate the real efficacy of school closure for pandemic control over time, no definitive answer to this question has been given. Available findings seem to confirm that to ensure adequate learning and to avoid social and economic problems, schools must remain open, provided that the adults who follow children at home and at school absolutely comply with recommendations for prevention measures and that school facilities can be optimized in order to significantly reduce the spread of infection. In this regard, the universal use of face masks in addition to hand hygiene and safe distancing in schools, at least starting from the age of 6 years, seems extremely useful. Moreover, since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak the use of telemedicine to manage suspected SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals in the community has appeared to be an easy and effective measure to solve many paediatric problems and could represent a further support to schools . CONCLUSIONS: We think that schools must remain open, despite COVID-19 pandemic. However, several problems strictly related to school frequency and reduction of infectious risk must be solved before school attendance can be considered completely safe. A single more in-depth guideline agreed between countries with the same school problems could be very useful in eliminating doubts and fostering the compliance of students, teachers and non-teaching school staff reducing errors and misinterpretations.","Esposito, Susanna; Cotugno, Nicola; Principi, Nicola",Ital J Pediatr,102,28

ASEAN’s most fundamental diplomatic task has of course been to continue building ASEAN communities, but the ability of the association of minor powers in Southeast Asia is limited. Hence, it can be said that ASEAN’s most important diplomatic task has been to maintain favorable relations with external powers, in particular, with China and the United States. The present study argues that ASEAN has managed to maintain favorable relations with and receive support from both of these external powers by conducting “equidistant diplomacy” with them. In concrete terms, it has fostered favorable relations with China.

Thus, the purpose of this study was to identify major issues of current PPE for body protection and assess its needs within health care. METHODS: An online survey was conducted with a convenience sample of 200 U.S. healthcare professionals who interact with patients. The survey was designed to identify the types of PPE that HCWs currently use, assess current PPE design features for body protection, examine the effect of PPE design features for body protection, and HCWs' years of work experiences on overall PPE acceptability, and explore current PPE maintenance practices. Both quantitative and qualitative data were used for analyses. RESULTS: This study showed the need for current PPE improvement in terms of fit, comfort, mobility, and donning and doffing for HCWs' safety and health. Donning and doffing plays an important role in HCWs' overall acceptance of PPE for body protection. This study revealed that most HCWs dispose of their PPE in a trashcan in a healthcare unit and non‐disposed PPE is laundered at home, which may expose their family members to a health risk if a proper precaution is not followed. CONCLUSION: This study provides critical insights for the needs of (a) novel PPE design research and (b) proper donning and doffing training and its strict regulatory effort to ensure HCWs' safety and health.","Lee, Young‐A; Salahuddin, Mir; Gibson‐Young, Linda; Oliver, Gretchen D.",Health Sci Rep,102,29

Using a reflexive content analytic approach, this study sheds light on some of these questions, underscoring the disconnect between science, policymaking, and society. Global health funding approaches; politicization of the pandemic, including political blame gaming; mistrust of government and other institutions; and a lack of robust accountability measures are some of the pandemic response obstacles. However, COVID-19 has also presented an opportunity for a collaboration that may potentially solidify global solidarity. A pandemic response built on strategic global health diplomacy, vaccine diplomacy, and science diplomacy can spur both political and economic benefits, advancing development, health security, and justice. The virus thrives and flourishes in face of political divisions and lack of cooperation.

Deployment of an effective HIV-1 vaccine regimen will likely target adolescents and young adults and therefore safety for pregnant and breastfeeding women will need to be addressed. METHODS: We performed a retrospective, cross-protocol analysis to identify and compare pregnancy outcomes reported in 53 Phase 1 and Phase 2a HIV-1 vaccine clinical trials conducted by the HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN). RESULTS: Two thousand six hundred seventy-three women of reproductive potential were identified and 193 pregnancies were reported. 39 of 53 (74%) studies had at least one pregnancy reported with an overall pregnancy rate of 3.15 per 100 woman-years (w-yr). While active contraception use was required during study participation, 13 of the 53 studies also contained a long-term follow up period during which pregnancy was no longer discouraged. The pregnancy rate during main study participation was 3.09 per 100 w-yr, while pregnancies occurred at a slightly greater rate in the long-term follow up period (3.22 per 100 w-yr). Adverse pregnancy outcomes were reported at similar rates between vaccinees and placebo recipients when vaccine vectors, adjuvant used, or geographic region were examined. CONCLUSION: Although there is considerable heterogeneity amongst the different vaccine trials, there appears to be no obvious indication of increased risk of adverse pregnancy or birth outcomes in these early phase HIV-1 vaccine studies. More complete data on pregnancy outcomes should be collected in early phase HIV-1 vaccine clinical trials to better inform subsequent efficacy trials.

Outpatients with asthma exacerbations underwent follow‐up evaluations, their swabs were collected and clinical outcomes were recorded at their next clinic visit 4 weeks later. One hundred forty‐three inpatients and 131 outpatients, including 88 patients with asthma exacerbations and 43 controls with stable asthma were recruited. HRV‐A was mainly detected in September and February (45.5% and 33.3%, respectively), while HRV‐C was mainly detected in November and April (70.0% and 55.6%, respectively). HRV‐C was the primary type and was primarily found in inpatients with severe asthma exacerbations.

In addition to mechanical barriers and a variety of innate defense factors, mucosal immunoglobulins (Igs) provide protection by two complementary mechanisms: specific antibody activity and innate, Ig glycan-mediated binding, both of which serve to contain the mucosal microbiota in its physiological niche. Thus, the interaction of bacterial ligands with IgA glycans constitutes a discrete mechanism that is independent of antibody specificity and operates primarily in the intestinal tract. This mucosal site is by far the most heavily colonized with an enormously diverse bacterial population, as well as the most abundant production site for antibodies, predominantly of the IgA isotype, in the entire immune system. In embodying both adaptive and innate immune mechanisms within a single molecule, S-IgA maintains comprehensive protection of mucosal surfaces with economy of structure and function.","Mestecky, Jiri; Russell, Michael W.",Immunology Letters,102,16

It is associated with increased activation of the clotting system leading to thrombotic complications in 5 to 23% of cases[1]. It is known to cause significant venous thromboembolism and few cases with arterial thrombosis with increased risk of life-threatening complications like myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, splenic infarct, and left ventricular clot have been reported[2]. CASE PRESENTATION: A 70-year-old female with a past medical history of coronary artery disease, Hypertension, COPD, recent COVID-19 (3 weeks ago) not requiring admission to hospital presented to the hospital with bilateral leg and forearm pain. Leg pain was worse with activity. She had feeble peripheral pulses on palpation.She underwent Computed Tomography angiography which showed extensive arterial thrombosis involving the distal abdominal aorta, left common iliac artery, superior mesenteric artery, and also showed an area of wedge-shaped infarction in the spleen. She had a thrombus at the apex of the left ventricle, with incidental 1.3 cm spiculated mass in the left lung. There was no evidence of venous thromboembolism in imaging.She was started on therapeutic anticoagulation with heparin. After multidisciplinary discussion with Hematology, Vascular surgery, and Cardiology, her anticoagulation was changed to Enoxaparin. She was managed medically. Workup including JAK2, beta-2 glycoprotein antibodies, lupus anticoagulant, and anticardiolipin antibodies was negative. DISCUSSION: The exact mechanisms that activate coagulation cascade in SARS-CoV-2 infection are still unknown, but they are found to be associated with increased thrombogenesis. SARS-CoV-2 viral infection can activate the plasmatic clotting system by activating multiple procoagulant pathways. Angiotensin-converting enzymes 2 are normally found on various cells such as lymphocytes, alveolar cells, monocytes/macrophages, and platelets. In SARS-CoV-2 infection, Surface S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to its target transmembrane receptor( ACE2 protein) and down-regulates the expression of ACE2 protein. It leads to the accumulation of angiotensin II in the body which interacts with platelets and endothelial cells leading to further promotion of clot formation[3]. This was the likely cause of hypercoagulable state in our patient leading to thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS: An extensive arterial clot can be the initial presentation in COVID-19 patients and can be treated promptly with anticoagulation. Early introduction of prophylactic anticoagulation is necessary to prevent clot formation. REFERENCE #1:.Thromboinflammation and the hypercoagulability of COVID-19.

In flow-through operation, the nanoapertures experience pressure differences across the substrate in which they are fabricated, which imposes the risk for structural failure. This work presents an investigation of the deflection and structural stability of nanohole array-based optofluidic sensors operating in flow-through mode. The analysis was approached using experiments, simulations via finite element method, and established theoretical models. The results depict that certain areas of the sensor deflect under pressure, with some regions suffering high mechanical stress. The offset in the deflection values between theoretical models and actual experimental values is overturned when only the effective area of the substrate, of 450 µm, is considered. Experimental, theoretical, and simulation results suggest that the periodic nanostructures can safely operate under trans-membrane pressures of up to 20 psi, which induce deflections of up to ~20 μm.","Bdour, Yazan; Gomez-Cruz, Juan; Escobedo, Carlos",Micromachines (Basel),102,16

Real‐time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), followed by virus characterization by minor groove binder (MGB) probe assays, detected 216 parvovirus positive dogs with a predominance of canine parvovirus type 2a (CPV‐2a, 79.17%) over CPV‐2b (18.52%) and CPV‐2c (2.31%). Rottweilers and German shepherds were the most frequent breeds among CPV‐positive pedigree dogs (n = 96). Eighteen cats were found to shed parvoviruses in their faeces, with most strains being characterized as FPLV (n = 17), although a single specimen tested positive for CPV‐2a. Only two wild carnivores were parvovirus positive, a wolf (Canis lupus) and a red fox (Vulpes vulpes), both being infected by CPV‐2a strains.","Filipov, C.; Desario, C.; Patouchas, O.; Eftimov, P.; Gruichev, G.; Manov, V.; Filipov, G.; Buonavoglia, C.; Decaro, N.",Transbound Emerg Dis,102,1

This mechanism evolved from the ancestor bat coronavirus and is currently one of the main targets for antiviral strategies. However, there currently exist several Spike protein variants in the SARS-CoV-2 population as the result of mutations, and it is unclear if these variants may exert a specific effect on the affinity with ACE2 which, in turn, is also characterized by multiple alleles in the human population. In the current study, the GBPM analysis, originally developed for highlighting host-guest interaction features, has been applied to define the key amino acids responsible for the Spike/ACE2 molecular recognition, using four different crystallographic structures. Then, we intersected these structural results with the current mutational status, based on more than 295,000 sequenced cases, in the SARS-CoV-2 population. We identified several Spike mutations interacting with ACE2 and mutated in at least 20 distinct patients: S477N, N439K, N501Y, Y453F, E484K, K417N, S477I and G476S. Among these, mutation N501Y in particular is one of the events characterizing SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7, which has recently risen in frequency in Europe. We also identified five ACE2 rare variants that may affect interaction with Spike and susceptibility to infection: S19P, E37K, M82I, E329G and G352V. Significance Statement We developed a method to identify key amino acids responsible for the initial interaction between SARS-CoV-2 (the COVID-19 virus) and human cells, through the analysis of Spike/ACE2 complexes. We further identified which of these amino acids show variants in the viral and human populations. Our results will facilitate scientists and clinicians alike in identifying the possible role of present and future Spike and ACE2 sequence variants in cell entry and general susceptibility to infection.","Ortuso, Francesco; Mercatelli, Daniele; Guzzi, Pietro Hiram; Giorgi, Federico Manuel",bioRxiv,102,1

Using real‐time survey evidence from the UK in April and May 2020, we document which workers were most likely to be furloughed and we analyse variation in the terms on which they furloughed. We find that women were significantly more likely to be furloughed. Inequality in care responsibilities seems to have played a key role: mothers were 10 percentage points more likely than fathers to initiate the decision to be furloughed (as opposed to it being fully or mostly the employer's decision) but we find no such gender gap amongst childless workers. The prohibition of working whilst furloughed was routinely ignored, especially by men who can do a large percentage of their work tasks from home. Women were less likely to have their salary topped up beyond the 80 per cent subsidy paid for by the government. Considering the future, furloughed workers without employer‐provided sick pay have a lower willingness to pay to return to work, as do those in sales and food preparation occupations. Compared with non‐furloughed employees, furloughed workers are more pessimistic about keeping their job in the short to medium run and are more likely to be actively searching for a new job, even when controlling for detailed job characteristics. These results have important implications for the design of short‐time work schemes and the strategy for effectively reopening the economy.","Adams‐Prassl, Abi; Boneva, Teodora; Golin, Marta; Rauh, Christopher",Fisc Stud,102,1

Findings problematize PPE shortages as material, discursive, and symbolic triggers and explore how HCWs communicatively construct resilience given PPE shortages. This study extends CTR by: (a) underscoring the multidimensional nature of disruptive trigger events, (b) distinguishing the temporal element in cascading trigger events during periods of sustained disruption, and (c) attending to the transformational processes within the adaptation-transformation dialectic with the inclusion of a sixth resilience process, critiquing and resisting the status quo.

Since then, fourteen institutes, including CERN, have joined the collaboration to drive the scientific program of this unique installation and evaluate the needs of the community to improve the research in imaging, diagnostics, radiation therapy and personalized medicine. The facility has been built as an extension of the ISOLDE (Isotope Separator On Line DEvice) facility at CERN. Handling of open radioisotope sources is made possible thanks to its Radiological Controlled Area and laboratory. Targets are being irradiated by the 1.4 GeV proton beam delivered by the CERN Proton Synchrotron Booster (PSB) on a station placed between the High Resolution Separator (HRS) ISOLDE target station and its beam dump. Irradiated target materials are also received from external institutes to undergo mass separation at CERN-MEDICIS. All targets are handled via a remote handling system and exploited on a dedicated isotope separator beamline. To allow for the release and collection of a specific radionuclide of medical interest, each target is heated to temperatures of up to 2,300°C. The created ions are extracted and accelerated to an energy up to 60 kV, and the beam steered through an off-line sector field magnet mass separator. This is followed by the extraction of the radionuclide of interest through mass separation and its subsequent implantation into a collection foil. In addition, the MELISSA (MEDICIS Laser Ion Source Setup At CERN) laser laboratory, in service since April 2019, helps to increase the separation efficiency and the selectivity. After collection, the implanted radionuclides are dispatched to the biomedical research centers, participating in the CERN-MEDICIS collaboration, for Research & Development in imaging or treatment. Since its commissioning, the CERN-MEDICIS facility has provided its partner institutes with non-conventional medical radionuclides such as Tb-149, Tb-152, Tb-155, Sm-153, Tm-165, Tm-167, Er-169, Yb-175, and Ac-225 with a high specific activity.

A link between D-dimer and mortality has also been established. MATERIALS: A retrospective study was carried out at the University Hospital Center of Oujda (Morocco) from November 01st to December 01st, 2020. Our study population was divided into two groups: a diabetic group and a second group without diabetes to compare clinical and biological characteristics between the two groups. In addition, the receiver operator characteristic curve was used to assess the optimal D-dimer cut-off point for predicting mortality in diabetics. RESULTS: 201 confirmed-COVID-19-patients were included in the final analysis. The median age was 64 (IQR 56-73), and 56% were male. Our study found that D-dimer levels were statistically higher in diabetic patients compared to non-diabetic patients. (1745 vs 845 respectively, P = 0001). D-dimer level > 2885 ng/mL was a significant predictor of mortality in diabetic patients with a sensitivity of 71,4% and a specificity of 70,7%.

Public health interventions have had significant impacts in reducing transmission and in averting even more deaths. Nonetheless, in many jurisdictions (both at national and local levels) the decline of cases and fatalities after apparent epidemic peaks has not been rapid. Instead, the asymmetric decline in cases appears, in some cases, to be consistent with plateau- or shoulder-like phenomena. Here we explore a model of fatality-driven awareness in which individual protective measures increase with death rates. In this model, epidemic dynamics can be characterized by plateaus, shoulders, and lag-driven oscillations after exponential rises at the outset of disease dynamics. We also show that incorporating long-term awareness can avoid peak resurgence and accelerate epidemic decline. We suggest that awareness of epidemic severity is likely to play a critical role in disease dynamics, beyond that imposed by intervention-driven policies.","Weitz, Joshua S.; Park, Sang Woo; Eksin, Ceyhun; Dushoff, Jonathan",medRxiv,102,28

The cardiovascular mechanisms of injury are poorly understood and speculative. We aim to use multimodality cardiac imaging including cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) and positron emission tomography with 2-deoxy-2-[fluorine-18]fluoro-d-glucose integrated with computed tomography (18F-FDG-PET/CT) to identify the cardiac pathophysiological mechanisms related to COVID-19 infections. METHODS: This is a single-centre exploratory observational study aiming to recruit 50 patients with COVID-19 infection who will undergo cardiac biomarker sampling. Of these, 30 patients will undergo combined CTCA and 18F-FDG-PET/CT, followed by CMR. Prevalence of obstructive and non-obstructive atherosclerotic coronary disease will be assessed using CTCA. CMR will be used to identify and characterise myocardial disease including presence of cardiac dysfunction, myocardial fibrosis, myocardial oedema and myocardial infarction. 18F-FDG-PET/CT will identify vascular and cardiac inflammation. Primary endpoint will be the presence of cardiovascular pathology and the association with troponin levels. DISCUSSION: The results of the study will identify the presence and modality of cardiac injury associated COVID-19 infection, and the utility of multi-modality imaging in diagnosing such injury. This will further inform clinical decision making during the pandemic.

In addition, all EBMs indicated higher heat stress within the city centre that were conducive of both urban extreme heatwaves and very hot days during the summer months, with extreme heat stress levels lasting for longer than a week with PET values reaching a maximum of 48 °C. Similar cold extremes were found for the winter months, with PET values reaching − 30 °C, and average PS levels varying lower in the case of the peri-urban station.

This randomized study aimed to compare the efficacy and tolerability of a novel 1‐L low‐volume PEG‐based preparation: 1 L PEG+Asc (PEG3350, sodium ascorbate, sodium sulfate, ascorbic acid, sodium chloride, and potassium chloride) with PEG+SPMC (PEG3350, sodium chloride, potassium chloride and sodium sulfate, sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, citric acid, and aspartame), prior to routine colonoscopy at an Australian tertiary referral center. METHODS: Outpatients undergoing colonoscopy were randomized to receive either split‐dose 1 L PEG+Asc or split‐dose PEG+SPMC. Bowel preparation quality using the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BPPS), modified Aronchick scores, procedure time, cecal intubation, and adenoma detection rates were recorded. Patient compliance and tolerability were captured using a standardized questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 173 patients were randomized, of whom 164 completed the study and were allocated to 1 L PEG+Asc (n = 82) or PEG+SPMC (n = 82). Non‐inferiority of 1 L PEG+Asc was demonstrated with 89% achieving successful preparation (total BPPS ≥6 and each sub‐score ≥2) compared with 85.4% in the PEG+SPMC group, resulting in an estimated difference of 3.7% (95% CI −6.6% to 13.9%). The median BBPS was non‐inferior in all colonic segments with 1 L PEG+Asc (BBPS 3 [interquartile range 2–3]) vs PEG+SPMC (BBPS 2 [interquartile range 2–3]). More 1 L PEG+Asc patients reported moderate to severe nausea (P = 0.028), but overall tolerability was similar. CONCLUSIONS: The quality of bowel preparation achieved with 1 L PEG+Asc is non‐inferior to that with PEG+SPMC, with similar tolerability outcomes.

The goals of our study were two-fold. First, we characterised the relationships between eating duration, unprocessed and processed food consumption and metabolic health. During 4 weeks of observation, 213 adults used a smartphone application to record food and drink consumption, which was annotated for food processing levels following the NOVA classification. Low consumption of unprocessed food and low physical activity showed significant associations with multiple MS components. Second, in a pragmatic randomised controlled trial, we compared the metabolic benefits of 12 h time-restricted eating (TRE) to standard dietary advice (SDA) in 54 adults with an eating duration > 14 h and at least one MS component. After 6 months, those randomised to TRE lost 1.6% of initial body weight (SD 2.9, p = 0.01), compared to the absence of weight loss with SDA (−1.1%, SD 3.5, p = 0.19). There was no significant difference in weight loss between TRE and SDA (between-group difference −0.88%, 95% confidence interval −3.1 to 1.3, p = 0.43). Our results show the potential of smartphone records to predict metabolic health and highlight that further research is needed to improve individual responses to TRE such as a shorter eating window or its actual clock time.","Phillips, Nicholas Edward; Mareschal, Julie; Schwab, Nathalie; Manoogian, Emily N.

ACE-2, a type-I transmembrane metallocarboxypeptidase, is a critical regulator of the renin-angiotensin system. The entry of SARS-CoV-2 within host cells results in a reduced availability of ACE-2 on the host cell surface followed by significant downregulation of ACE-2 gene expression. As ACE-2 is a well-known cardio-protective molecule, its downregulation could result in severe cardiac disorders. This review deals with a challenging aspect of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients who are asymptomatic or have mild syndromes similar to influenza infections. These patients are proving to be the Achilles’ heel to combat COVID-19 mainly in developing countries of South Asia, where the average number of tests conducted per million individuals is considerably low. Consequently, there is high possibility that individuals with negligible respiratory trouble will not be tested for SARS-CoV-2. Hence, a huge percentage of the population have the risk of developing cardiovascular disorders as a bystander effect of viral infection apart from being potential reservoir of disease transmission. Based on available demographic as well as molecular data, this review predicts a huge spike in cardiovascular disorders among this undetected reservoir in post COVID-19 era.","Gupta, Shreyasi; Mitra, Arkadeep",Heart Fail Rev,102,10

T cell responses to viruses can be corrected by adoptive cellular therapy using donor-derived virus-specific T cells. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2-exposed blood donations contain CD4 and CD8 memory T cells specific for SARS-CoV-2 spike, nucleocapsid and membrane antigens. These peptides can be used to isolate virus-specific T cells in a GMP-compliant process. These T cells can be rapidly expanded using GMP-compliant reagents for use as a therapeutic product. Memory and effector phenotypes are present in the selected virus-specific T cells, but our method rapidly expands the desirable central memory phenotype.

Thus, they have become one of the keys to controlling the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Common examples, including N95 masks, surgical masks, and face coverings, are passive devices that minimize the spread of suspended pathogens by inserting an aerosol-filtering barrier between the user’s nasal and oral cavities and the environment. However, the filtering process does not adapt to changing pathogen levels or other environmental factors, which reduces its effectiveness in real-world scenarios. This paper addresses the limitations of passive masks by proposing ADAPT, a smart IoT-enabled “active mask”. This wearable device contains a real-time closed-loop control system that senses airborne particles of different sizes near the mask by using an on-board particulate matter (PM) sensor. It then intelligently mitigates the threat by using mist spray, generated by a piezoelectric actuator, to load nearby aerosol particles such that they rapidly fall to the ground. The system is controlled by an on-board micro-controller unit that collects sensor data, analyzes it, and activates the mist generator as necessary. A custom smartphone application enables the user to remotely control the device and also receive real-time alerts related to recharging, refilling, and/or decontamination of the mask before reuse. Experimental results on a working prototype confirm that aerosol clouds rapidly fall to the ground when the mask is activated, thus significantly reducing PM counts near the user. Also, usage of the mask significantly increases local relative humidity levels.","Kalavakonda, Rohan Reddy; Masna, Naren Vikram Raj; Mandal, Soumyajit; Bhunia, Swarup",Sci Rep,102,24

Lower numbers of cases and deaths might be due to pre-existing cross-immunity induced by circulating common cold human coronaviruses (HCoVs) before the COVID-19 pandemic. To investigate pre-existing mucosal antibodies against COVID-19, we compared IgA reactivity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and HCoVs in milk of mothers collected in 2018. Methods Ugandan and US milk samples were run on enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay (ELISA) to measure specific IgA to SARS-CoV-2 and HCoVs NL63, OC43, HKU1, and 229E spike proteins. Pooled plasma from US COVID-19 positive and negative cases were positive and negative controls, respectively. Results One Ugandan mother had high milk IgA reactivity against all HCoVs and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. Ugandan mothers had significantly higher IgA reactivity against the betacoronavirus HCoV-OC43 than US mothers (p = 0.018). By contrast, US mo thers had significantly higher IgA reactivity against the alphacoronaviruses HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 than Ugandan mothers (p < 0.0001 and 0.035, respectively).

Technology-assisted remote research strategies reduce barriers to research recruitment; however, few studies have reported on the efficiency and effectiveness of these approaches. OBJECTIVE: This study introduces and evaluates the efficacy of technology-assisted remote research designed for people who experience AVH. METHODS: Our group developed an integrated, automated and human complementary web-based recruitment and enrollment apparatus that incorporated Google Ads, web-based screening, identification verification, hybrid automation, and interaction with live staff. We examined the efficacy of that apparatus by examining the number of web-based advertisement impressions (ie, number of times the web-based advertisement was viewed); clicks on that advertisement; engagement with web-based research materials; and the extent to which it succeeded in representing a broad sample of individuals with AVH, assessed through the self-reported AVH symptom severity and demographic representativeness (relative to the US population) of the sample recruited. RESULTS: Over an 18-month period, our Google Ads advertisement was viewed 872,496 times and clicked on 11,183 times. A total amount of US $4429.25 was spent on Google Ads, resulting in 772 individuals who experience AVH providing consent to participate in an entirely remote research study (US $0.40 per click on the advertisement and US $5.73 per consented participant) after verifying their phone number, passing a competency screening questionnaire, and providing consent. These participants reported high levels of AVH frequency (666/756, 88.1% daily or more), distress (689/755, 91.3%), and functional interference (697/755, 92.4%). They also represented a broad sample of diversity that mirrored the US population demographics. Approximately one-third (264/756, 34.9%) of the participants had never received treatment for their AVH and, therefore, were unlikely to be identified via traditional clinic-based research recruitment strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Web-based procedures allow for time saving, cost-efficient, and representative recruitment of individuals with AVH and can serve as a model for future studies focusing on hard-to-reach populations.","Buck, Benjamin; Chander, Ayesha; Brian, Rachel M; Wang, Weichen; Campbell, Andrew T; Ben-Zeev, Dror",JMIR Form Res,102,3

Design: A records-based study of the first 1000 patients with a positive result on real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assay for SARS-CoV-2 admitted to our facilities. Various factors such as demographics, presenting symptoms, co-morbidities, ICU admission, oxygen requirement and ventilator therapy were studied. Results: Of the 1000 patients, 24 patients were excluded due to lack of sufficient data. Of the remaining 976 in the early phase of the epidemic, males were admitted twice as much as females (67.1% and 32.9%, respectively). Mortality in this initial phase was 10.6% and slightly higher for males and steeply higher for older patients. More than 8% reported no symptoms and the most common presenting symptoms were fever (78.3%), productive cough (37.2%), and dyspnea (30.64%). More than one-half (53.6%) had no co-morbidity. The major co-morbidities were hypertension (23.7%), diabetes without (15.4%), and with complications (9.6%). The co-morbidities were associated with higher ICU admissions, greater use of ventilators as well as higher mortality. A total of 29.9% were admitted to the ICU, with a mortality rate of 32.2%. Mortality was steeply higher in those requiring ventilator support (55.4%) versus those who never required ventilation (1.4%). The total duration of hospital stay was just a day longer in patients admitted to the ICU than those who remained in wards. Conclusion: Male patients above the age of 60 and with co-morbidities faced the highest rates of mortality. They should be admitted to the hospital in early stage of the disease and given aggressive treatment to help reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19.","Budhiraja, S.; Soni, A.; Jha, V.; Indrayan, A.; Dewan, A.; Singh, O.; Singh, Y.; Chugh, I.; Arora, V.; Pandey, R.; Ansari, A.; Jha, S.",,102,1

To address this problem, a two‐stepped methodology is proposed. First, a compound natural factor (CNF) model is developed via assigning weight to each of seven investigated natural factors, that is temperature, humidity, visibility, wind speed, barometric pressure, aerosol, and vegetation in order to show their coupling relationship with the COVID‐19 trajectory. Onward, the empirical distribution based framework (EDBF) is employed to iteratively optimize the coupling relationship between trajectory and CNF to express the real interaction. In addition, the collected data is considered from the backdate, that is about 23 days—which contains 14‐days incubation period and 9‐days invalid human response time—due to the nonavailability of prior information about the natural spreading of virus without any human intervention(s), and also lag effects of the weather change and social interventions on the observed trajectory due to the COVID‐19 incubation period; Second, the optimized CNF‐plus‐polynomial model is used to predict the future trajectory of COVID‐19. Results revealed that aerosol and visibility show the higher contribution to transmission, wind speed to death, and humidity followed by barometric pressure dominate the recovery rates, respectively. Consequently, the average effect of environmental change to COVID‐19 trajectory in China is minor in all variables, that is about −0.3%, +0.3%, and +0.1%, respectively. In this research, the response analysis of COVID‐19 trajectory to the compound natural interactions presents a new prospect on the part of global pandemic trajectory to environmental changes.","Zuo, Zhengkang; Ullah, Sana; Yan, Lei; Sun, Yiyuan; Peng, Fei; Jiang, Kaiwen; Zhao, Hongying",Earths Future,102,22

Although in most Spanish-speaking countries, inclusive language has been limited to the realms of activism, gender studies and a certain type of public administration, in Argentina, its use has been extended to different social spheres, mostly urban. Considering such context, this work aims to investigate the inclusive language in Spanish and characterize its most relevant resources in a series of public texts that circulated in Argentina between 2018 and 2020. On the one hand, its origin is explained, differentiating it from non-sexist language and the different theoretical positions around inclusive language are exposed. On the other hand, from the Dialogical Approach to Argumentation and Polyphony, this paper proposes to address inclusive language resources as subjectivity and polyphony marks which evidence certain aspects of the discourse of patriarchy, with respect to which there is dissent; therefore, inclusive language resources show viewpoints that were once silenced and rejected. For this, a corpus of various speeches is addressed, made up of outdoor urban inscriptions, flyers (advertisements), audiovisual informative speeches and digital press, written in inclusive language, between 2018 and 2020. Throughout the paper it is warns that the inclusive language marks, such as –e and x, are traces of the “heterogeneity shown marked” that object to grammatical binarism and convey comments by the subject about their own enunciation, alluding to the image of previous sexist and patriarchal discourses with whom they disagree. The analysis reveals that the words or expressions in which inclusive language resources are employed (-e and x) work as traces of harassed identities and manifest comments by the speaker on their own enunciation. This way, this research shows that gender inclusive language holds conflict linguistic marks which point to historically denied dissidence forms, linked to gender identity and the assertion of collective rights. Finally, this article aims at, on the one hand, contributing to the description of Argentinean Spanish, and on the other, promoting reflection in favor of linguistic education. Undoubtedly, opening instances of debate on the subject can have an impact on the deepening of linguistic reflection and the training of speakers who contribute to forging a more egalitarian society, one which is inclusive and respectful of differences.","Tosi, Carolina",Front Sociol,102,24

In this article, we focus on the “narrative battle” over COVID-19 that has escalated between two competing major powers – China and the US. Guided by a cultural sociological approach, we reveal the meaning-making processes behind the narrative battle through in-depth, hermeneutical reconstruction of the “reactive performance” of each country, as articulated in political speeches and mass media. We point out that, in the Chinese narrative, the country emerges from a “century of humiliation,” becoming a major world power that will no longer be subject to the “bullying” of the West. In the US narrative, even though Trump initially highlights the country’s “very good” relationship with China, as the storyline unfolds, China is blamed for the global pandemic, assuming again the role of a dangerous actor on the world stage. Our research shows that the current reactive communicative mechanism is not only unsustainable, but also dangerous in times of crisis.

Data were collected through self-designed questionnaires, including demographic variables, knowledge, perceived vulnerability, response efficacy, anxiety and preventive practices. Descriptive statistics and chi-square tests were performed. Hierarchical logistic regression was conducted to determine the predictors. A total of 2996 participants completed this study. Of them, 2358 (78.7%) participants reported washing hands regularly in the last two weeks, and 1699 (56.7%) always wore masks outside this year. Knowledge (hand washing: OR = 1.09, p < 0.01; mask wearing: OR = 1.17, p < 0.01) and response efficacy (hand washing: OR = 1.61, p < 0.01; mask wearing: OR = 1.70, p < 0.01) were positively associated with preventive practices, whereas perceived vulnerability had a negative effect (hand washing: OR = 0.54, p < 0.01; mask wearing: OR = 0.72, p < 0.01). Knowledge, response efficacy and perceived vulnerability were found to be significant predictors of the preventive practice among older adults in the post-COVID-19 era. This study provides new insights into preventive suggestions after the peak of the pandemic and also has significant implications in improving the life quality of older adults.","Chen, Meijun; Wang, Xiaoqi; Yun, Qingping; Lin, Yuting; Wu, Qingqing; Yang, Qinghua; Wan, Dezhi; Tian, Dan; Chang, Chun",Int J Environ Res Public Health,102,23

On this basis, we postulated that the Elliott Wave Principle may similarly be used to predict the future evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic. We demonstrated that this method reproduces the data pattern especially well for USA (daily new cases).

Groups from China Identified and sequenced the virus responsible for COVID-19, named SARS-CoV-2, and determined that it was a novel coronavirus (CoV) that shared high sequence identity with bat- and pangolin-derived SARS-like CoVs, suggesting a zoonotic origin. SARS-CoV-2 is a member of Coronaviridae, a family of enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that infect a broad range of vertebrates. The rapid release of the sequence of the virus has allowed the development of diagnostic tools (e.g., RT-PCR). Additionally, serological tests can allow identification of persons who have been infected. In humans, CoVs tend to cause mild to moderate upper respiratory tract infections. The fatality rate is around 1-3% for infected persons. An acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) likely due to an uncontrolled immune activation (“cytokine storm”) occurs in patients with severe disease and poor prognosis. Risk factors for mortality include: advanced age, obesity, diabetes, hypertension and other comorbidities. Drug repurposing has been used to rapidly identify potential treatment for COVID-19, which could move quickly to phase-3. Better knowledge of the virus, its enzymes, will be mandatory to develop more potent and specific direct-acting antiviral agents (DAA). In the long term, a vaccine to prevent infection would be crucial; however even if successful it might not be available before 2021-22. To date, with the exception of intravenous Remdesivir and dexamethasone, which have modest effects in moderate to severe COVID-19, no strong clinical evidence supports the efficacy and safety of any other drugs against SARS-CoV-2. The aim of this review is to provide insights on the discovery of SARS-CoV-2, its virology, the diagnostic tools, and the ongoing drug discovery effort.","Asselah, Tarik; Durantel, David; Pasmant, Eric; Lau, George; Schinazi, Raymond F.",J Hepatol,102,1

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine how and to what extent the severe restrictions affected the mental health and health-related quality of life of non-infected people, in a comparison between Israel and Italy. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted during the first week of May 2020 among 510 Israeli and 505 Italian participants. Anxiety and depression levels were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4), and the short form-8 health survey (SF-8) questionnaire measured health-related quality of life. Linear hierarchic regression forced steps analysis was performed to measure the unique contribution of each variable to predicting health-related quality of life. RESULTS: After adjusting for socioeconomic variables, the results showed a significantly higher anxiety level and lower health-related quality of life in the Italian participants. The anxiety and depression variables predicted lower health-related quality of life. Physical activity was found to be a protective factor. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that early monitoring of anxiety and depression in situations such as quarantine may detect the risk for decline in health-related quality of life. Establishment of professional interventions is needed in order to prevent the negative health consequences of the pandemic-related policy.

The spike (S) protein is one of the best characterized proteins of SARS-CoV, which plays a key role in SARS-CoV overcoming species barrier and accomplishing interspecies transmission from animals to humans, suggesting that it may be the major target of selective pressure. However, the process of adaptive evolution of S protein and the exact positively selected sites associated with this process remain unknown. RESULTS: By investigating the adaptive evolution of S protein, we identified twelve amino acid sites (75, 239, 244, 311, 479, 609, 613, 743, 765, 778, 1148, and 1163) in the S protein under positive selective pressure. Based on phylogenetic tree and epidemiological investigation, SARS outbreak was divided into three epidemic groups: 02–04 interspecies, 03-early-mid, and 03-late epidemic groups in the present study. Positive selection was detected in the first two groups, which represent the course of SARS-CoV interspecies transmission and of viral adaptation to human host, respectively. In contrast, purifying selection was detected in 03-late group. These indicate that S protein experiences variable positive selective pressures before reaching stabilization. A total of 25 sites in 02–04 interspecies epidemic group and 16 sites in 03-early-mid epidemic group were identified under positive selection. The identified sites were different between these two groups except for site 239, which suggests that positively selected sites are changeable between groups. Moreover, it was showed that a larger proportion (24%) of positively selected sites was located in receptor-binding domain (RBD) than in heptad repeat (HR)1-HR2 region in 02–04 interspecies epidemic group (p = 0.0208), and a greater percentage (25%) of these sites occurred in HR1–HR2 region than in RBD in 03-early-mid epidemic group (p = 0.0721). These suggest that functionally different domains of S protein may not experience same positive selection in each epidemic group. In addition, three specific replacements (F360S, T487S and L665S) were only found between 03-human SARS-CoVs and strains from 02–04 interspecies epidemic group, which reveals that selective sweep may also force the evolution of S genes before the jump of SARS-CoVs into human hosts. Since certain residues at these positively selected sites are associated with receptor recognition and/or membrane fusion, they are likely to be the crucial residues for animal-to-human transmission of SARS-CoVs, and subsequent adaptation to human hosts. CONCLUSION: The variation of positive selective pressures and positively selected sites are likely to contribute to the adaptive evolution of S protein from animals to humans.","Zhang, Chi-Yu; Wei, Ji-Fu; He, Shao-Heng",BMC Microbiol,102,1

This potential relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and clock genes, coupled with previously reported effects of night shift work on health leads us to hypothesize that night shift workers may be at an increased physiological risk of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). Shift work, especially night shift work, has long been associated with several chronic health conditions. The mechanisms that drive these associations are not well understood; however, current literature suggests that the disruption of circadian rhythms may cause downstream hormonal and immune effects that render night shift workers more susceptible to disease. First, circadian rhythms may play a role in the mechanism of viral infection, as viral vaccines administered in the morning elicit greater immune responses than those administered in the afternoon. Next, increased exposure to light at night may inhibit melatonin production, which has been observed to enhance DNA repair and shown to upregulate expression of Bmal1, an established as an inhibitor of herpes simplex virus and influenza. Finally, abnormal immune cell and cytokine levels have been observed following night-shift work.

On 30 January 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared the COVID-19 epidemic as a public health emergency of international concern. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2, since the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, marked the third introduction of a highly pathogenic and large-scale epidemic coronavirus into the human population in the twenty-first century. As of 1 March 2020, a total of 87,137 confirmed cases globally, 79,968 confirmed in China and 7169 outside of China, with 2977 deaths (3.4%) had been reported by WHO. Meanwhile, several independent research groups have identified that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to β-coronavirus, with highly identical genome to bat coronavirus, pointing to bat as the natural host. The novel coronavirus uses the same receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as that for SARS-CoV, and mainly spreads through the respiratory tract. Importantly, increasingly evidence showed sustained human-to-human transmission, along with many exported cases across the globe. The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients include fever, cough, fatigue and a small population of patients appeared gastrointestinal infection symptoms. The elderly and people with underlying diseases are susceptible to infection and prone to serious outcomes, which may be associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cytokine storm. Currently, there are few specific antiviral strategies, but several potent candidates of antivirals and repurposed drugs are under urgent investigation. In this review, we summarized the latest research progress of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical characteristics of COVID-19, and discussed the current treatment and scientific advancements to combat the epidemic novel coronavirus.","Guo, Yan-Rong; Cao, Qing-Dong; Hong, Zhong-Si; Tan, Yuan-Yang; Chen, Shou-Deng; Jin, Hong-Jun; Tan, Kai-Sen; Wang, De-Yun; Yan, Yan",Mil Med Res,102,1

Early detection of canine parvovirus (CPV-2) is crucial to initiating appropriate outbreak control strategies. Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), a novel isothermal gene amplification technique, has been developed for the molecular detection of diverse pathogens. In this study, a real-time RPA assay was developed for the detection of CPV-2 using primers and an exo probe targeting the CPV-2 nucleocapsid protein gene. RESULTS: The real-time RPA assay was performed successfully at 38 °C, and the results were obtained within 4–12 min for 10(5)–10(1) molecules of template DNA. The assay only detected CPV-2, and did not show cross-detection of other viral pathogens, demonstrating a high level of specificity. The analytical sensitivity of the real-time RPA was 10(1) copies/reaction of a standard DNA template, which was 10 times more sensitive than the common RPA method. The clinical sensitivity of the real-time RPA assay matched 100% (n = 91) to the real-time PCR results. CONCLUSION: The real-time RPA assay is a simple, rapid, reliable and affordable method that can potentially be applied for the detection of CPV-2 in the research laboratory and point-of-care diagnosis.

Indeed, cellular miRNAs target and hybridize to specific sequences of both HTLV-1 and HIV-1 viral transcripts. However, much like the variety of host immune responses to retroviral infection, the virus itself contains mechanisms that assist in the evasion of viral inhibition through control of the cellular RNAi pathway. Retroviruses can hijack both the enzymatic and catalytic components of the RNAi pathway, in some cases to produce novel viral miRNAs that can either assist in active viral infection or promote a latent state. Here, we show that HTLV-1 Tax contributes to the dysregulation of the RNAi pathway by altering the expression of key components of this pathway. A survey of uninfected and HTLV-1 infected cells revealed that Drosha protein is present at lower levels in all HTLV-1 infected cell lines and in infected primary cells, while other components such as DGCR8 were not dramatically altered. We show colocalization of Tax and Drosha in the nucleus in vitro as well as coimmunoprecipitation in the presence of proteasome inhibitors, indicating that Tax interacts with Drosha and may target it to specific areas of the cell, namely, the proteasome. In the presence of Tax we observed a prevention of primary miRNA cleavage by Drosha. Finally, the changes in cellular miRNA expression in HTLV-1 infected cells can be mimicked by the add back of Drosha or the addition of antagomiRs against the cellular miRNAs which are downregulated by the virus.","Van Duyne, Rachel; Guendel, Irene; Klase, Zachary; Narayanan, Aarthi; Coley, William; Jaworski, Elizabeth; Roman, Jessica; Popratiloff, Anastas; Mahieux, Renaud; Kehn-Hall, Kylene; Kashanchi, Fatah",PLoS One,102,16

Second, for each selected context passage, an answer is obtained using a pretrained bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) question-answering model. Third, an opinion aggregator, which is a combination of a biterm topic model and k-means clustering, is applied to the task of aggregating all answers into several opinions. RESULTS: We applied the proposed pipeline to extract answers, opinions, and the most frequent words related to six questions from the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge. By showing the longitudinal distributions of the opinions, we uncovered the trends of opinions and popular words in the articles published in the five time periods assessed: before 1990, 1990-1999, 2000-2009, 2010-2018, and since 2019. The changes in opinions and popular words agree with several distinct characteristics and challenges of COVID-19, including a higher risk for senior people and people with pre-existing medical conditions; high contagion and rapid transmission; and a more urgent need for screening and testing. The opinions and popular words also provide additional insights for the COVID-19–related questions. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with other methods of literature retrieval and answer generation, opinion aggregation using our method leads to more interpretable, robust, and comprehensive question-specific literature reviews. The results demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method in answering COVID-19–related questions with main opinions and capturing the trends of research about COVID-19 and other relevant strains of coronavirus in recent years.","Lu, Zhao-Hua; Wang, Jade Xiaoqing; Li, Xintong",J Med Internet Res,102,2

A total of 99 COVID-19 patients were recruited and completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) Scale. Results showed there was no significant difference in anxiety or depressive symptoms between male and female. Patients aged 46–60 years old had a higher ratio of both anxiety and depressive symptoms. Besides, patients whose hospital stays was longer than 14 days had a higher risk of depressive symptoms than those stays was less than 7 days. There was no significant difference in the correlation between level of dyspnea and the levels of anxiety or depressive symptoms. In conclusion, COVID-19 patients might have anxiety and depressive symptoms during hospitalization. Clinicians should pay attention to the middle age group and patients with longer hospital stays.","Li, Xueyi; Tian, Jun; Xu, Qun",Psychiatr Q,102,16

METHODS: Hospitalised patients aged ≥ 70 were included, comparing COVID-19 cases with non-COVID-19 controls admitted over the same period. Frailty was prospectively measured and mortality ascertained through linkage with national and local statutory reports. RESULTS: In 217 COVID-19 cases and 160 controls, older age and South Asian ethnicity, though not socioeconomic position, were associated with higher mortality. For frailty, differences in effect size were evident between cases (HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.93–1.12) and controls (HR 1.99, 95% CI 1.46–2.72), with an interaction term (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.37–0.71) in multivariable models. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that (1) frailty is not a good discriminator of prognosis in COVID-19 and (2) pathways to mortality may differ in fitter compared with frailer older patients.","Miles, Amy; Webb, Thomas E.; Mcloughlin, Benjamin C.; Mannan, Imran; Rather, Arshad; Knopp, Paul; Davis, Daniel",Eur Geriatr Med,102,1
