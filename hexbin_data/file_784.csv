35238,Nieuwe voorzitter Raad van Bestuur Wendy Borneman: “Ik ben een verbinder”,2020-06-23,"This paper introduces a new cross-platform programming framework for developing quantum-accelerated scientific computing applications and executing them on most of today’s cloud-based quantum computers and simulators. It makes use of C++ template meta-programming techniques to implement quantum algorithms as generic, platform-independent expressions, which get automatically synthesized into device-specific compute kernels upon execution. Our software framework supports concurrent and asynchronous execution of multiple quantum kernels via a CUDA-inspired stream concept.","Möller, Matthias; Schalkers, Merel",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7304771/,784

44659,Casuïstiekprijs H&W voor Pim Keurlings,2021-01-18,"As a result of travel activities, overtourism has become a global issue. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic, the topic of overtourism would benefit localized overcrowding as a new occurrence in the tourism industry. Since there is no specific measurement to evaluate tourist experiences at crowded attractions, this study aims to explore the perception and feelings of tourists when they visit popular and crowded attractions through topic modeling and sentiment analysis based on TripAdvisor online reviews as of the end of 2019. By investigating the top 10 attractions in Paris, the results present 24 topics frequently discussed by tourists. Examples of some topics related to overtourism are safety, service, queuing, and social interaction. Specifically, tourists felt the most negative towards safety and security among all the identified topics. By bridging overtourism, text analytics, and user-generated-content, this study contributes to the field of tourist experiences and crowd management.","Yu, Joanne; Egger, Roman",Information and Communication Technologies in Tourism 2021,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7798079/,784
53514,Reactie ‘Nu thuismeting van zuurstofsaturatie ineens reguliere huisartsenzorg lijkt te zijn…’,2021-05-25,"FUNDING ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: Type of funding sources: None. BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic many countries have imposed lockdown restrictions to movement. Since the 18th of March in Portugal, thousands of people have been confined to their homes. While hospital admissions for COVID-19 patients increased exponentially, admissions for non-COVID-19 patients decreased dramatically. However, it remains unclear whether lockdown-related immobility can contribute to the increased incidence of pulmonary embolism. PURPOSE: To compare the incidence of pulmonary embolism (PE) during the lockdown period (Abril 1 to May 31, 2020) compared to the reference period in 2019. METHODS: Retrospective study of consecutive outpatients who presented to the emergency department and underwent computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) due to suspicion of PE. RESULTS: Compared to the same period of 2019, the lockdown period was associated with a significant increase in PE diagnosis (29 versus 18 patients). PE patients during lockdown were older (median age 71 years; interquartile range [IQR][60-85] versus 59 years [44-76]; p = 0.046) and have lower prevalence of active cancer (14% versus 33% in the reference period). Women represent 55% (n = 16) of patients in lockdown group (versus 50% in 2019 group). Clinical probability (GENEVA score) was similar in both groups (median score 2.72 in lockdown group and 2.50 in reference group, p = 0.452). None of the patients with PE was diagnosed with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: We have observed a marked increase (62%) in PE diagnosis during lockdown period compared to the reference period, which can be explained by the reduction in physical activity due to teleworking and closure of gyms and sports activities. These data reinforce the importance of promoting physical activity programs at home. The role of pharmacological or mechanical thromboprophylaxis in this scenario remains unclear.","Silva, BV; Rodrigues, T; Cunha, N; Brito, J; Alves Da Silva, P; Silverio Antonio, P; Couto Pereira, S; Aguiar Ricardo, I; Rigueira, J; Mendonca, C; Abreu, A",Eur J Prev Cardiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8136048/,784
239592,Koester hoogbegaafden door ze op tijd te ontdekken,2021,"COVID-19 is an infection induced by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, and severe forms can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring intensive care unit (ICU) management. Severe forms are associated with coagulation changes, mainly characterized by an increase in D-dimer and fibrinogen levels, with a higher risk of thrombosis, particularly pulmonary embolism. The impact of obesity in severe COVID-19 has also been highlighted.In this context, standard doses of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) may be inadequate in ICU patients, with obesity, major inflammation, and hypercoagulability. We therefore urgently developed proposals on the prevention of thromboembolism and monitoring of hemostasis in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.Four levels of thromboembolic risk were defined according to the severity of COVID-19 reflected by oxygen requirement and treatment, the body mass index, and other risk factors. Monitoring of hemostasis (including fibrinogen and D-dimer levels) every 48 h is proposed. Standard doses of LMWH (e.g., enoxaparin 4000 IU/24 h SC) are proposed in case of intermediate thrombotic risk (BMI < 30 kg/m2, no other risk factors and no ARDS). In all obese patients (high thrombotic risk), adjusted prophylaxis with intermediate doses of LMWH (e.g., enoxaparin 4000 IU/12 h SC or 6000 IU/12 h SC if weight > 120 kg), or unfractionated heparin (UFH) if renal insufficiency (200 IU/kg/24 h, IV), is proposed. The thrombotic risk was defined as very high in obese patients with ARDS and added risk factors for thromboembolism, and also in case of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), unexplained catheter thrombosis, dialysis filter thrombosis, or marked inflammatory syndrome and/or hypercoagulability (e.g., fibrinogen > 8 g/l and/or D-dimers > 3 µg/ml). In ICU patients, it is sometimes difficult to confirm a diagnosis of thrombosis, and curative anticoagulant treatment may also be discussed on a probabilistic basis. In all these situations, therapeutic doses of LMWH, or UFH in case of renal insufficiency with monitoring of anti-Xa activity, are proposed.In conclusion, intensification of heparin treatment should be considered in the context of COVID-19 on the basis of clinical and biological criteria of severity, especially in severely ill ventilated patients, for whom the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism cannot be easily confirmed.","Susen, Sophie; Tacquard, Charles Ambroise; Godon, Alexandre; Mansour, Alexandre; Garrigue, Delphine; Nguyen, Philippe; Godier, Anne; Testa, Sophie; Levy, Jerrold H; Albaladejo, Pierre; Gruel, Yves",Crit Care,,784

484011,Internationale samenwerking tussen huisartsen in opleiding,2020,"In this study, a novel hierarchically porous N-doped carbon (HPNC) material was successfully prepared by soft-templating method. The commercial triblock copolymer of Pluronic F127 and a polyazine derived from hydrazine hydrate & glyoxal were used as soft template and precursor, respectively. The obtained materials were fully characterized and tested as a sorbent for the removal of hydrophilic dyes of Methylene blue (MB), Basic Fuchsin (BF), Eosin Y (EY) and Rhodamine B (RB) from their aqueous effluents. According to the characterization results, the synthesized material of HPNC-1000 presented thick fibrous morphology with micron size in diameter, hierarchically porous structure with surface area of 1853 m2/g, pore volume of 1.59 cm3/g and nitrogen content of 4.5 wt%. Adsorption-desorption investigation reveals that synergistic effect of hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen-bonding formation of the dye molecules with the sorbent was most pronounced in the adsorptions. The maximum adsorption capacities for MB, BF, EY and RB reached 0.83, 0.92, 1.23 and 1.83 mmol g-1, respectively. The adsorption processes well fitted by the pseudo first-order kinetic model and the Liu's isotherm. The sorbent can be regenerated by above 90% of the initial adsorption efficiency after six regeneration cycles.","Zhao, Songlin; Chen, Fushan; Zhu, Xiandi; Liu, Weijun; Wu, Chenlin; Zhang, Jie; Ren, Shibin; Yan, Zhengzhong; Cao, Wenli; Zhang, Qunfeng; Li, Xiaonian",J Hazard Mater,,784

OBJECTIVE: To provide evidence-based estimates of children infected with SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) and projected cumulative numbers of severely ill pediatric COVID-19 cases requiring hospitalization during the US 2020 pandemic. DESIGN: Empirical case projection study. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Adjusted pediatric severity proportions and adjusted pediatric criticality proportions were derived from clinical and spatiotemporal modeling studies of the COVID-19 epidemic in China for the period January-February 2020. Estimates of total children infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the United States through April 6, 2020, were calculated using US pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) cases and the adjusted pediatric criticality proportion. Projected numbers of severely and critically ill children with COVID-19 were derived by applying the adjusted severity and criticality proportions to US population data, under several scenarios of cumulative pediatric infection proportion (CPIP). RESULTS: By April 6, 2020, there were 74 children who had been reported admitted to PICUs in 19 states, reflecting an estimated 176 190 children nationwide infected with SARS-CoV-2 (52 381 infants and toddlers younger than 2 years, 42 857 children aged 2-11 years, and 80 952 children aged 12-17 years). Under a CPIP scenario of 5%, there would be 3.7 million children infected with SARS-CoV-2, 9907 severely ill children requiring hospitalization, and 1086 critically ill children requiring PICU admission. Under a CPIP scenario of 50%, 10 865 children would require PICU admission, 99 073 would require hospitalization for severe pneumonia, and 37.0 million would be infected with SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Because there are 74.0 million children 0 to 17 years old in the United States, the projected numbers of severe cases could overextend available pediatric hospital care resources under several moderate CPIP scenarios for 2020 despite lower severity of COVID-19 in children than in adults.","Pathak, Elizabeth Barnett; Salemi, Jason L.; Sobers, Natasha; Menard, Janelle; Hambleton, Ian R.",J Public Health Manag Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32282440/; https://doi.org/10.1097/phh.0000000000001190,784
