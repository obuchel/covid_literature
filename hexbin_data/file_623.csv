A person-centered approach is used for identifying perfectionism profiles as well as analyzing inter-profile differences in terms of the six regulatory styles located on the autonomy-control continuum. A sample of 597 (M(age) = 22.08, SD = 3.33) Ecuadorian undergraduates enrolled in a sport science degree program was employed. Latent Profile Analysis based on two higher-order perfectionism dimensions, Perfectionistic Strivings (PS) and Perfectionistic Concerns (PC), supported a four-class solution: Non-Perfectionists (low PS and PC), Adaptive Perfectionists (high PS and low PC), Maladaptive Perfectionists (high PS and PC), and Moderate Perfectionists (moderate PS and PC). Adaptive Perfectionists obtained the highest means on Intrinsic, Integrated, and Identified regulations. However, these differences where only significant when compared with Moderate Perfectionists, and only in the case of Integrated regulation, in comparison with Non-Perfectionists. In contrast, Maladaptive Perfectionists obtained significantly higher scores on Introjected and External regulations as well as on Amotivation than the other three classes. Results are discussed in light of Self-Determination Theory.","Vicent, María; Sanmartín, Ricardo; Vásconez-Rubio, Oswaldo; García-Fernández, José Manuel",Int J Environ Res Public Health,623,22

However, the developmental ability of cold-stored embryos decreases with prolonged storage periods. Therefore, the transported embryos must be readily transferred to recipient mice upon arrival. The cryopreservation of cold-transported embryos may improve the flexibility of the schedule of embryo transfer. In this paper, we examined the viability and developmental ability of vitrified-warmed mouse embryos at the two-cell stage after cold storage in refrigerated temperatures for 0, 24, 48, 72, or 96 h. The viability of vitrified-warmed embryos after cold storage was comparable to vitrified-warmed embryos without cold storage. Vitrified-warmed embryos after cold storage also developed normally to pups by embryo transfer. In addition, live pups were obtained from vitrified-warmed embryos after cold-transportation from Asahikawa Medical University. In summary, cold-stored embryos can be used for the transportation and archive of genetically engineered mice.","Mukunoki, Ayumi; Takeo, Toru; Nakao, Satohiro; Tamura, Kana; Horikoshi, Yuka; Nakagata, Naomi",Exp Anim,623,22

However, variations may occur within individual countries, which are relevant to inform health promoting policies as populations live longer. The present study estimates asthma prevalence and examines the sociodemographic characteristics and environmental determinants associated with asthma in older adults in Ghana. METHODS: This study utilised data from the nationally representative World Health Organization Study on global AGEing and adult health (SAGE) Ghana Wave 2. A final sample of 4621 individuals residing in 3970 households was used in analytical modelling. Factors associated with asthma were investigated using single level and multilevel binary logistic regression models. RESULTS: Asthma was reported by 102 (2.2%) respondents. Factors associated with asthma in the univariate model were: those aged 60–69 (OR = 5.22, 95% CI: 1.24, 21.95) and 70 or more (OR = 5.56, 95% CI: 1.33, 23.26) years, Ga-Adangbe dialect group (OR = 1.65, 95% CI: 1.01, 2.71), no religion (OR = 3.59, 95% CI: 1.77, 7.28), having moderate (OR = 1.76, 95% CI: 1.13, 2.75) and bad/very bad (OR = 2.75, 95% CI: 1.58, 4.80) health state, and severe/extreme difficulty with self-care (OR = 3.49, 95% CI: 1.23, 9.88) and non-flush toilet facility (OR = 0.62, 95% CI: 0.39, 0.99). Factors independently associated with asthma in the adjusted models were: those aged 60–69 (OR = 4.49, 95% CI: 1.03, 19.55) years, father with primary education or less (OR = 0.40, 95% CI: 0.17, 0.94), no religion (OR = 2.52, 95% CI: 1.18, 5.41), and households with non-flush toilet facility (OR = 0.58, 95% CI: 0.35, 0.96). Significant residual household-level variation in asthma was observed. Over 40% of variance in asthma episodes could be attributable to residual household-level variations. CONCLUSION: Individual as well as household factors were seen to influence the prevalence of asthma in this national survey. Clinical management of these patients in health facilities should consider household factors in addition to individual level factors.","Aheto, Justice Moses K.; Udofia, Emilia A.; Kallson, Eugene; Mensah, George; Nadia, Minicuci; Nirmala, Naidoo; Chatterji, Somnath; Kowal, Paul; Biritwum, Richard; Yawson, Alfred E.",PLoS One,623,22

This study investigated the association between intraoperative end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO(2)) and length of hospital stay (LOS) in patients who underwent pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (PPPD). METHODS: The medical records of 759 patients from 2006 to 2015 were reviewed. The patients were divided into two groups based on the mean EtCO(2) value during general anesthesia: the hypocapnia group (< 35 mmHg) and the normocapnia group (≥ 35 mmHg). The primary outcome was LOS between the groups. Secondary outcomes included the length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, postoperative 30-day, 1-year, and 2-year mortality, and perioperative factors associated with LOS. RESULTS: A total of 727 patients were finally analyzed. The median LOS of the hypocapnia group was significantly longer than that of the normocapnia group (22 days vs. 18 days, respectively; p < 0.001). Postoperative mortality did not differ between the groups. Cox regression analysis revealed that hypocapnia was an independent risk factor for longer LOS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.37–1.89; p < 0.001). Age and postoperative pancreatic fistula were also risk factors for a longer LOS. CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded that low levels of intraoperative EtCO(2) during general anesthesia were associated with an increased LOS for patients undergoing PPPD.","Park, Ji-Hoon; Lee, Hye-Mi; Kang, Chang Moo; Kim, Kyung Sub; Jang, Chul Ho; Hwang, Ho Kyoung; Lee, Jeong-Rim",World J Surg,623,22

We aimed to evaluate the change of midkine in sepsis and its association with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) system, as well as the mechanism by which midkine induced in sepsis and lung injury. METHODS: The peripheral blood sample of septic patients on admission was obtained and measured for midkine, ACE and angiotensin II. Cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) mouse model was used, and adeno-associated virus (AAV) was stilled trans-trachea for regional targeting midkine expression, comparing the severity of lung injury. Furthermore, we studied the in vitro mechanism of midkine activates ACE system by using inhibitors targeting candidate receptors of midkine, and its effects on the vascular endothelial cells. RESULTS: Plasma midkine was significantly elevated in sepsis, and was closely associated with ACE system. Both circulating and lung midkine was increased in CLP mouse, and was related to severe lung injury. Regional interfering midkine expression in lung tissue by AAV could alleviate acute lung injury in CLP model. In vitro study elucidated that Notch 2 participated in the activation of ACE system and angiotensin II release, induced by midkine and triggered vascular endothelial injury by angiotensin II induced reactive oxygen species production. CONCLUSIONS: Midkine inhibition ameliorates sepsis induced lung injury, which might via ACE/Ang II pathway and the participation of Notch 2 in the stimulation of ACE.

Individual PEB is personally driven, self-reliant, and are conducted on one's own (e.g., home recycling). Group focused PEB is other people-reliant and completed as part of a group (e.g., attending meetings of an environmental organisation). A wide range of identities have been related to PEBs. For example, a recent systematic qualitative review revealed 99 different types of identities studied in a PEB context. Most studies were correlational, few had an experimental design. However, the relationships between all these identities and PEBs have so far not been tested quantitatively with meta-analytical techniques. As such, a clear overview of this field is currently lacking. Due to the diverse nature of the field, a priori hypotheses were not possible and relatively broad definitions of identity had to be used to encompass all types of identities and the diverse meanings of identity that have been included in PEB research. What prior theory did allow for was to assess the distinction between two main types of identity, namely how people label, describe, and recognise oneself individually (individual identity), or as part of a group (group identity). Our overall goal was thus to assess the current state of knowledge on identities and PEBs. In 104 studies using a meta-regression following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines, our random-effects meta-analysis showed that the overall concept of identity associated with PEB with a medium Pearson's r (Aim 1). Furthermore, we found that individual identities associated more strongly with PEBs than group identities (Aim 2). The associations between individual and group identities were stronger when the identity and PEB were from the same category (e.g., when both were group-focused; Aim 3). Methodologically, the findings revealed that group identities and group PEBs were most strongly associated for self-reported rather than observed PEBs (Aim 4). Overall identity associated most strongly with group PEBs in the field rather than in the lab (Aim 5) and in student- rather than non-student samples (Aim 6). We discuss the theoretical and practical implications.","Udall, Alina Mia; de Groot, Judith I.M.; De Jong, Simon B.; Shankar, Avi",Front Psychol,623,22

The announcement of a pregnancy is often met with ignorance and unanswered questions by chief physicians and colleagues. The aim of this study is to clarify how urological chief physicians assess the current situation and to present liability risks versus health risks. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From July to October 2019, an anonymous online questionnaire was sent to 340 chief physicians by the Working Group Young Urologists of the German Society of Urology (DGU). The questionnaire asked about the risk assessment of the workplace, the timing of a pregnancy announcement, and the employment possibilities of pregnant employees in urology. In addition, a law firm was commissioned to prepare a brief legal opinion on the topic of medical work and surgery during pregnancy with specific reference to the field of urology, including any liability risks. RESULTS: In all, 62 chief physicians participated in the survey (18.2%): 93.5% of the respondents considered an anticipatory risk assessment of the workplace for pregnant women to be useful; 82.3% would appreciate an overlapping recruitment by the employer. Respondents (62.9%) were skeptical of pregnant employees operating. Taking into account the regulations of the Maternity Protection Act, the liability risk does not exceed that which the employer generally has to bear. CONCLUSION: The amendment of the Maternity Protection Act has not fundamentally changed the reality for female urologists. However, the individual risk assessment provides an opportunity to develop concrete protective measures—also for the operating room—with the employer. The aim must be to provide pregnant women with greater support in asserting their rights in the future.","Arnold, H; Beck, A; Mattigk, A; Himmler, M; Harke, N. N.; von Ostau, N.; Necknig, U.

Use of the Hybrid ER enables CT diagnosis and emergency therapeutic interventions without transferring the patient to another room. We describe an illustrative case of severe multiple blunt trauma that included injuries to the brain and torso to highlight the ability to perform multiple procedures in the Hybrid ER. CASE PRESENTATION: A 46-year-old man sustained multiple injuries after falling from height. An early CT scan performed in the Hybrid ER revealed grade IIIa thoracic aortic injury, left lung contusion, and right subdural haematoma and subarachnoid haemorrhage. Without relocating the patient, all definitive procedures, including trepanation, total pneumonectomy, and thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair were performed in the Hybrid ER. At 5.72 h after definitive surgery was begun, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit. CONCLUSIONS: The Hybrid ER has the potential to facilitate the performance of multiple definitive procedures in combination to treat severe multiple blunt trauma including injuries to the brain and torso.

Edible insects have already proven to be safe for the environment and with a high nutritional value, but Westerners are still reluctant towards this novel food. Therefore, the aims of this paper are twofold, and were tested on a sample of 202 Italian consumers. On one hand, we aimed to further develop a recently validated psychological instrument, the Entomophagy Attitude Questionnaire (EAQ), by combining it with a measure of perceived risk. On the other hand, we wanted to test whether different animals fed with insects would be accepted by consumers. Our results clearly show that the perceived risk does not significantly improve the predictive validity of EAQ, while, with respect to the second aim, we found that beef and pork reared with insects were less accepted than fish and poultry. ABSTRACT: Insects are a promising alternative protein source and their possible integration in the human diet has been extensively studied, also with reference to the degree of consumer acceptability and the main factors determining reluctance among Western consumers. Several studies have also proposed the use of protein meals derived from insects in animal feed as a possible way to promote the development of the insect chain. Consumer attitudes, perceived risks, and intention to eat insect-based foods have been extensively researched, yet the relationships between those factors are still unclear. On a sample of 202 Italian consumers, the present research used the Entomophagy Attitude Questionnaire (EAQ) to analyse the degree of acceptability of insects as food and meat obtained from animals raised on insect-based feeds with a specific focus on the role of attitudes and perceived risk. The research also evaluated the differences in acceptability between different types of animals fed with insects. The results show that the intention to engage in entomophagy is significantly correlated with all three of the EAQ’s subscales, as well as with perceived risk. However, the effect of perceived risk does not significantly improve the predictive validity of EAQ with respect to the intention to eat insect-based food. The results also show that the degree of acceptability for different insect meal-reared animals changes among consumers: beef and pork are characterized by a lower degree of acceptability, while poultry and fish are more accepted by consumers.","La Barbera, Francesco; Amato, Mario; Fasanelli, Roberto; Verneau, Fabio",Insects,623,31

We aimed to investigate whether SSC stabilizes the respiration compared to incubator care in mechanically ventilated preterm infants. METHODS: The prospective observational study was performed in Turku University Hospital, Finland. Preterm infants were eligible if they were born before 36 weeks gestation and received respiratory support with either invasive or non-invasive neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA). SSC was applied as soon as possible after birth. Respiratory variables were collected from the ventilator log data, and SSC episodes were compared with matched control periods during incubator care. RESULTS: A total of 167 episodes of SSC were recorded from 17 preterm infants: 138 episodes during invasive NAVA and 29 episodes during non-invasive NAVA. During invasive NAVA, peak electrical activity of the diaphragm (Edi), minimum Edi, respiratory rate, time on backup ventilation, peak inspiratory pressure, and mean airway pressure were significantly lower in SSC than in incubator care. During non-invasive NAVA, peak Edi, minimum Edi, time on backup ventilation, and peak inspiratory pressure were significantly lower in SSC than in incubator care. CONCLUSIONS: SSC stabilized and improved the respiratory physiology in mechanically ventilated preterm infants. IMPACT: Skin-to-skin contact reduced work of breathing compared to incubator care in mechanically ventilated preterm infants. Skin-to-skin contact reduced the need for backup ventilation during neurally adjusted ventilatory assist in preterm infants. Skin-to-skin contact among ventilated preterm infants was not only safe but also stabilized and improved their respiratory physiology.","Lee, Juyoung; Parikka, Vilhelmiina; Lehtonen, Liisa; Soukka, Hanna",Pediatr Res,623,22

Suitable and robust preclinical animal models for testing the safety and efficacy of different types of MSC products before use in clinical trials are rare. We here introduce two highly robust animal models of immune pathology: 1) acute radiation syndrome (ARS) and 2) graft versus host disease (GvHD), in conjunction with studying the immunomodulatory effect of well-characterized Interferon gamma (IFNγ) primed bone marrow derived MSCs. The animal model of ARS is based on clinical grade dosimetry precision and bioluminescence imaging. We found that allogeneic MSCs exhibit lower persistence in naïve compared to irradiated animals, and that intraperitoneal infusion of IFNγ prelicensed allogeneic MSCs protected animals from radiation induced lethality by day 30. In direct comparison, we also investigated the effect of IFNγ prelicensed allogeneic MSCs in modulating acute GvHD in an animal model of MHC major mismatched bone marrow transplantation. Infusion of IFNγ prelicensed allogeneic MSCs failed to mitigate acute GvHD. Altogether our results demonstrate that infused IFNγ prelicensed allogeneic MSCs protect against lethality from ARS, but not GvHD, thus providing important insights on the dichotomy of IFNγ prelicensed allogenic MSCs in well characterized and robust animal models of acute tissue injury.","Chinnadurai, Raghavan; Bates, Paul D.; Kunugi, Keith A.; Nickel, Kwangok P.; DeWerd, Larry A.; Capitini, Christian M.; Galipeau, Jacques; Kimple, Randall J.",Front Immunol,623,22

High mutation burden, high expression of immune signatures, and mutations in BRCA2 are associated with pembrolizumab molecular sensitivity, while abundant copy-number alterations and B2M loss-of-heterozygosity corresponded with resistance. Upon treatment, induction of genes expressed by T cell, B cell, and myeloid cell populations are consistent with sensitivity and resistance.

However, many barriers still exist for the real-world effectiveness and implementation of such PRO tools in routine care. Furthermore, limited research has evaluated the acceptability, feasibility, and benefits of such tools across different health care settings. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the acceptability, feasibility, and perceived benefits of the Danish digital PRO diabetes tool in different health care settings in Denmark and to determine the factors affecting its implementation. Furthermore, the study evaluates the psychometric characteristics of the Danish PRO Diabetes Questionnaire and the validity of the scoring algorithms for dialogue support. The objective of this study is to guide the ongoing optimization of the PRO diabetes tool, its implementation, and the design of future randomized controlled effectiveness studies. METHODS: We designed a multicenter, mixed methods, single-arm acceptability-feasibility implementation study protocol to contribute to the real-world pilot test of a new digital PRO diabetes tool in routine diabetes care. The use of the tool involves two main steps. First, the people with diabetes will complete a digital PRO Diabetes Questionnaire in the days before a routine diabetes visit. Second, the health care professional (HCP) will use a digital PRO tool to review the PRO results together with the people with diabetes during the visit. The PRO diabetes tool is designed to encourage and support people to take an active role for the people with diabetes in their own care and to expedite the delivery of person-centered, collaborative, and coordinated care. RESULTS: A multicenter pilot study protocol and psychometrically designed digital data collection tools for evaluation were developed and deployed as part of a national evaluation of a new digital PRO diabetes intervention. A total of 598 people with diabetes and 34 HCPs completed the study protocol by April 1, 2021. CONCLUSIONS: A large-scale, mixed methods, multicenter study for evaluating the use of the nationally developed PRO Diabetes Questionnaire in routine care across all health care sectors in Denmark by using the RE-AIM (Reach, Efficacy, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance) model as a framework has been designed and is ongoing. This study is expected to provide new important and detailed information about the real-world acceptability, perceived relevance, and benefits of the PRO diabetes tool among a large heterogeneous population of people with diabetes in Denmark and HCPs in different care settings. The results will be used to further improve the PRO tool, design implementation facilitation support strategies, and design future controlled effectiveness studies.

This is particularly true when it comes to transmitting statistical and probabilistic data to an audience of non-experts, inevitably conditioning their perception of risk. Data are all available, but subjects are able to understand them in the specific meanings proper to a specialized language, only if they are adequately transmitted. And we find these phenomena in the difficulty in representing the trend of, for instance, Covid-19 contagion, based on probability of contagion and mortality. In general, then, when we communicate scientific terms or data we should re-introduce the psychological aspects which characterize communication. The nudging strategies can be considered as a prototype of approach to overcome risky behaviours, which takes into account the cognitive characteristics of the human system. This strategy acts on different levels, using implicit factors, bypassing defensive attitudes and exploiting adaptive inferential processes, without overloading the cognitive system. But from a communicative point of view, nudge, as well as any other type of intervention, is not a general ‘recipe. The acceptance of the suggestion, the effectiveness of the nudging implies the congruity with the system that receives it: the “way of reasoning”, and its implicit layer has to be taken into account. The right combination of the source, the adopted message and the decisional setting could improve the efficacy of the public policies.","Macchi, Laura",Mind Soc,623,1

Using a synthetic control approach, I find that strict initial lockdown measures play an important role in limiting the spread of the COVID-19 infection, as the infection cases in Sweden would have been reduced by almost 75 percent had its policymakers followed stricter containment policies. As people dynamically adjust their behaviour in response to information and policies, the impact of nonpharmaceutical interventions becomes visible, with a time lag of around 5 weeks. Supplementary robustness checks and an alternative difference-in-differences framework analysis do not fundamentally alter the main conclusions. Finally, extending the analysis to excess mortality, I find that the lockdown measures would have been associated with a lower excess mortality rate in Sweden by 25 percentage points, with a steep age gradient of 29 percentage points for the most vulnerable elderly cohort. The outcome of this study can assist policymakers in laying out future guidelines to further protect public health, as well as facilitate plans for economic recovery.","Cho, Sang-Wook (Stanley)",Econom J,623,22

The prevalence of M. bovis-associated mastitis in both cattle and buffaloes has been increasingly recognized as a global problem. High morbidity rates and consequential economic losses have been devastating to the affected cattle and buffalo farms, especially those in developing countries. Therefore, a rapid and accurate method is urgently needed to detect M. bovis. In this study, a rapid and simple lateral flow strip for detecting antibodies against M. bovis was established that used carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) as the labelled materials. The results from the test strip were highly consistent with those from ELISA. The test showed high specificity (100%) and no cross-reaction with other bovine pathogens. The detection sensitivity of the test was also relatively high (97.67%). All the results indicated that the colloidal carbon test strip could serve as a simple, rapid, sensitive, and specific diagnostic method for detecting antibodies against M. bovis at cattle farms.","Shi, Feng; Zhao, Yang; Sun, Yixiao; Chen, Chuangfu",World J Microbiol Biotechnol,623,1

Using longitudinal data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), we find that, as past work suggests, Black-owned businesses are less likely to remain open 4 years later, compared to white-owned businesses, and that, due to this disparity, Black business owners are more likely to experience downward economic mobility and less likely to experience upward mobility, compared to their white counterparts. These results suggest that improving the rate at which Black entrepreneurs succeed, rather than increasing the rate at which Black people become entrepreneurs, should be the target of efforts to leverage business ownership to reduce the racial wealth gap.

The potential royalties payment may thus represent an intellectual property risk to those companies that implement technology subject to standardization.

Design Cohort study using routinely collected primary care records. Setting Routine practice in the United Kingdom. Participants Two mutually exclusive vaccinated cohorts included people vaccinated with either ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2 between 8 December 2020 and 6 March 2021. A third cohort consisted of people newly infected with SARS-Cov-2 identified by a first positive RT-PCR test between 1 September 2020 and 28 February 2021. The fourth general population cohort for background rates included those people with a visit between 1 January 2017 and 31 December 2019. In total, we included 1,868,767 ChAdOx1 and 1,661,139 BNT162b2 vaccinees, 299,311 people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and 2,290,537 people from the general population. Interventions First-dose of either ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2 Main outcome measures Outcomes included venous thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, and thrombosis with thrombocytopenia. Outcome rates were estimated for recipients of the ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2 vaccines, for people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and background rates in the general population. Indirectly standardized incidence ratios (SIR) were estimated. Results We included 1,868,767 ChAdOx1 and 1,661,139 BNT162b2 vaccinees, 299,311 people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and 2,290,537 people from the general population for background rates. The SIRs for pulmonary embolism were 1.23 [95% CI, 1.09-1.39] after vaccination with ChAdOx1, 1.21 [1.07-1.36] after vaccination with BNT162b2, and 15.31 [14.08 to 16.65] for infection with SARS-CoV-2. The SIRs for thrombocytopenia after vaccination were 1.25 [1.19 to 1.31] for ChAdOx1 and 0.99 (0.94 to 1.04) for BNT162b2. Rates of deep vein thrombosis and arterial thrombosis were similar among those vaccinated and the general population. Conclusions ChAdOx1 and BNT162b2 had broadly similar safety profiles. Thrombosis rates after either vaccine were mostly similar to those of the general population.

Central venous catheters have also been associated with an increased risk of thrombotic complications. Paradoxical embolism as an aetiological mechanism of ischaemic stroke should be considered in a highly prothrombotic context, where it may be more frequent. CASE REPORT: A 40-year-old woman with a central venous catheter, with a large vessel ischaemic stroke, treated with mechanical thrombectomy for an atypical paradoxical embolism while in intensive care for bilateral COVID-19 pneumonia. In the aetiological study, analysis highlighted an elevation of the D-dimer and right-left shunt with massive passage of contrast directly from the central peripheral access pathway in the left upper extremity to the left atrium in the transoesophageal echocardiogram. Thoracic tomographic angiography showed an anomalous venous structure with its origin in the subclavian vein and drainage to the segmental vein of the left upper lobe with direct emptying into the left atrium. Treatment consisted in anticoagulation until removal of the central venous catheter and simple anti-aggregating medication on discharge. CONCLUSIONS: Paradoxical embolism due to intra- or extra-cardiac shunt should be considered in patients with COVID-19, given the high associated risk of venous thromboembolism. Further studies are needed to be able to define optimal prophylactic and therapeutic management.","Ballvé-Martín, A; Boned, S; Rubiera, M",Rev Neurol,623,26

We also investigated the associations between socio-demographic characteristics and support for using telemedicine in this context and explored factors that influenced respondents' attitudes on the topic. STUDY DESIGN: In a nationally representative, web-based survey of US adults (n = 711), we asked open- and closed-ended questions about using telemedicine to prescribe medication abortion during COVID-19. We used multinomial logistic regression to assess the relationship between socio-demographic characteristics, endorsement of abortion labels, and political affiliation and support for telemedicine in this circumstance. Then, we conducted content and thematic analyses with the open-ended data to explore what influenced respondents' opinions. RESULTS: Overall, 332 (44%) of respondents supported using telemedicine for medication abortion during the pandemic; 237 (35%) opposed and 138 (21%) were unsure. Respondents who identified as prochoice were more likely to support using telemedicine for abortion during the pandemic than those who identified as prolife were to oppose it in this context (RRR 2.95; 95% CI 1.31-6.64). Via our content and thematic analysis, we identified that concerns about safety, the legitimacy of telemedicine, and the belief that abortion should occur as early in the pregnancy as possible influenced respondents' beliefs about using telemedicine for medication abortion. CONCLUSIONS: More respondents supported using telemedicine for medication abortion during COVID-19 than opposed it. Among respondents who expressed support, most thought that medication abortion was safe and that telemedicine was equivalent to the in-person provision of care. IMPLICATIONS: There appears to be support among US adults for the provision of medication abortion via telemedicine during COVID-19. Policymakers may consider public sentiment as well as clinical evidence when considering legislation about abortion.","LaRoche, Kathryn J; Jozkowski, Kristen N; Crawford, Brandon L; Haus, Katherine R",Contraception,623,24

Among them, 1 patient turned into a severe case during the course of the disease, and 1 patient showed a tendency to become severe case. It was found that 10 patients without severe conversion had an average blood Na+ of (138.3±1.3) mmol/L at admission, and the lowest blood Na+ during the course of disease was (135.9±3.1) mmol/L. However, 2 patients who became severe and had a tendency to become severe disease (Na+ levels at admission were 140.0 mmol/L and 138.0 mmol/L, respectively) experienced hyponatremia during the course of the disease (the lowest blood Na+ levels were 129.0 mmol/L and 122.0 mmol/L). Further analysis showed that the lower serum Na+ level, the higher level of white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP), but serum Na+ level was consistent with the change trend of lymphocytes, suggesting that hyponatremia was closely correlated with severe inflammation reaction. CONCLUSIONS: Serum Na+ showed decreasing tendency during the development of COVID-19, and hyponatremia was closely related to the severity of COVID-19. It was necessary to pay great attention to the change trend of blood Na+ level. However, further research was needed to obtain more reliable conclusions and explorer the pathophysiological mechanisms.","Zhang, Weidai; Lu, Senrong; Zhang, Mianfeng; Zheng, Hongbin; Huang, Yuhan; Chen, Suzhi; Kang, Huizhong; Wu, Suwu",Zhonghua Wei Zhong Bing Ji Jiu Yi Xue,623,1

This work proposes a wireless and flexible sensor sheet to investigate the thermoregulatory responses of different people under cold stimulation and exercise by measuring the temperature and moisture variations on the finger skin. An integrated flexible sensor system consists of a ZnIn2 S4 nanosheet-based humidity sensor and carbon nanotube/SnO2 temperature sensor. The results exhibit distinct thermoregulation abilities of five volunteers. Interestingly, the sudden increase in finger moisture that results from the excitation by the sympathetic nerve is observed during the cold-stimulus test. Although further studies are required to predict the potential diseases resulted from thermoregulation disorders in human body, this study provides a possibility of continuous and real-time monitoring of thermoregulatory activities via skin moisture and temperature detection using a flexible sensor sheet.","Lu, Yuyao; Fujita, Yusuke; Honda, Satoko; Yang, Shin-Hsin; Xuan, Yan; Xu, Kaichen; Arie, Takayuki; Akita, Seiji; Takei, Kuniharu",Adv Healthc Mater,623,22

Secondly, we sought to examine the potential predicting role of self-approach and self-avoidance goals on athletes’ intention to exercise during confinement, while self-avoidance goals were usually not related to this outcome in a more traditional context. Using a retrospective correlational design, the results of repeated measures ANOVA highlighted that self-approach goals scores decreased while self-avoidance goals scores increased and became the athletes’ goals with the highest score during confinement. The results of hierarchical regression analyses showed that self-approach and self-avoidance goals were both found as positive predictors of intention to exercise during confinement. This study reinforces the assumptions that (a) a specific achievement setting encourages the adoption of different achievement goals (which was identified here with regular athletes in an unusual context of confinement), (b) self-avoidance goals are not always maladaptive, and (c) shifting among multiple goals according to the requirements of the situation may be beneficial.","Mascret, Nicolas",Psychol.

Because of the close relationship between metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity and the presence of metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), a high number of cases of patients affected by both MAFLD and COVID-19 would be expected, especially in high-risk populations. Some studies have shown an increased risk of adverse clinical outcomes, viral shedding, and deep vein thrombosis, especially in patients with MAFLD- related liver fibrosis. The predisposition to poor outcomes and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in patients with MAFLD could be secondary to mechanisms common to both, including preexisting systemic chronic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and involvement of the renin-angiotensin system. Because of the increased risk of adverse outcomes, MAFLD should be screened in all patients admitted for COVID-19. Available computed tomography scans could be of help, assessment of liver fibrosis is also recommended, favoring noninvasive methods to limit the exposure of healthcare workers. Liver involvement in this population ranges from abnormalities in liver chemistry to hepatic steatosis in postmortem biopsies.

Methods and Findings -- The design was a matched case-control study. Severe COVID-19 was defined as either a positive nucleic acid test for SARS-CoV-2 in the national database followed by entry to a critical care unit or death within 28 days, or a death certificate with COVID-19 as underlying cause. Up to ten controls per case matched for sex, age and primary care practice were selected from the population register. All diagnostic codes from the past five years of hospitalisation records and all drug codes from prescriptions dispensed during the past nine months were extracted. Rate ratios for severe COVID-19 were estimated by conditional logistic regression. There were 4272 severe cases. In a logistic regression using the age-sex distribution of the national population, the odds ratios for severe disease were 2.87 for a 10-year increase in age and 1.63 for male sex. In the case-control analysis, the strongest risk factor was residence in a care home, with rate ratio (95% CI) 21.4 (19.1, 23.9). Univariate rate ratios (95% CIs) for conditions listed by public health agencies as conferring high risk were 2.75 (1.96, 3.88) for Type 1 diabetes, 1.60 (1.48, 1.74) for Type 2 diabetes, 1.49 (1.37, 1.61) for ischemic heart disease, 2.23 (2.08, 2.39) for other heart disease, 1.96 (1.83, 2.10) for chronic lower respiratory tract disease, 4.06 (3.15, 5.23) for chronic kidney disease, 5.4 (4.9, 5.8) for neurological disease, 3.61 (2.60, 5.00) for chronic liver disease and 2.66 (1.86, 3.79) for immune deficiency or suppression. 78% of cases and 52% of controls had at least one listed condition (NA of cases and NA of controls under age 40). Severe disease was associated with encashment of at least one prescription in the past nine months and with at least one hospital admission in the past five years [rate ratios 3.10 (2.59, 3.71)] and 2.75 (2.53, 2.99) respectively] even after adjusting for the listed conditions. In those without listed conditions significant associations with severe disease were seen across many hospital diagnoses and drug categories. Age and sex provided 2.58 bits of information for discrimination. A model based on demographic variables, listed conditions, hospital diagnoses and prescriptions provided an additional 1.25 bits (C-statistic 0.825). A limitation of this study is that records from primary care were not available. Conclusions -- Along with older age and male sex, severe COVID-19 is strongly associated with past medical history across all age groups. Many comorbidities beyond the risk conditions designated by public health agencies contribute to this. A risk classifier that uses all the information available in health records, rather than only a limited set of conditions, will more accurately discriminate between low-risk and high-risk individuals who may require shielding until the epidemic is over.","McKeigue, Paul M; Weir, Amanda; Bishop, Jen; McGurnaghan, Stuart; Kennedy, Sharon; McAllister, David; Robertson, Chris; Wood, Rachael; Lone, Nazir; Murray, Janet; Caparrotta, Thomas; Smith-Palmer, Alison; Goldberg, David; McMenamin, Jim; Ramsay, Colin; Hutchinson, Sharon; Colhoun, Helen M",,623,1

The reliability of serologic studies for quantifying the proportion of the population that have been infected depends on the extent of antibody decay as well as on assay performance in detecting both recent and older infections. Data on anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies persistence remain sparse, especially from infected individuals with few to no symptoms. In a cohort of mostly mild/asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals tested with three widely-used immunoassays, antibodies persisted for at least 8 months after infection, although detection depended on immunoassay choice, with one of them missing up to 40% of past infections. Simulations reveal that without appropriate adjustment for time-varying assay sensitivity, seroprevalence surveys may underestimate infection rates. As the immune landscape becomes more complex with naturally-infected and vaccinated individuals, assay choice and appropriate assay-performance-adjustment will become even more important for the interpretation of serologic studies.","Perez-Saez, J.; Zaballa, M.-E.; Yerly, S.; Andrey, D.
