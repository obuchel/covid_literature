2259,2259,2259,"Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Computer-Aided Detection: CNN Architectures, Dataset Characteristics and Transfer Learning",12.533598,1.9540339,2016-02-11,"Remarkable progress has been made in image recognition, primarily due to the availability of large-scale annotated datasets and deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). CNNs enable learning data-driven, highly representative, hierarchical image features from sufficient training data. However, obtaining datasets as comprehensively annotated as ImageNet in the medical imaging domain remains a challenge. There are currently three major techniques that successfully employ CNNs to medical image classification: training the CNN from scratch, using off-the-shelf pre-trained CNN features, and conducting unsupervised CNN pre-training with supervised fine-tuning. Another effective method is transfer learning, i.e., fine-tuning CNN models pre-trained from natural image dataset to medical image tasks. In this paper, we exploit three important, but previously understudied factors of employing deep convolutional neural networks to computer-aided detection problems. We first explore and evaluate different CNN architectures. The studied models contain 5 thousand to 160 million parameters, and vary in numbers of layers. We then evaluate the influence of dataset scale and spatial image context on performance. Finally, we examine when and why transfer learning from pre-trained ImageNet (via fine-tuning) can be useful. We study two specific computer-aided detection (CADe) problems, namely thoraco-abdominal lymph node (LN) detection and interstitial lung disease (ILD) classification. We achieve the state-of-the-art performance on the mediastinal LN detection, and report the first five-fold cross-validation classification results on predicting axial CT slices with ILD categories. Our extensive empirical evaluation, CNN model analysis and valuable insights can be extended to the design of high performance CAD systems for other medical imaging tasks.",,IEEE Trans Med Imaging,348,13

We applied a convolutional neural network to dermoscopy images of acral melanoma and benign nevi on the hands and feet and evaluated its usefulness for the early diagnosis of these conditions. METHODS: A total of 724 dermoscopy images comprising acral melanoma (350 images from 81 patients) and benign nevi (374 images from 194 patients), and confirmed by histopathological examination, were analyzed in this study. To perform the 2-fold cross validation, we split them into two mutually exclusive subsets: half of the total image dataset was selected for training and the rest for testing, and we calculated the accuracy of diagnosis comparing it with the dermatologist’s and non-expert’s evaluation. RESULTS: The accuracy (percentage of true positive and true negative from all images) of the convolutional neural network was 83.51% and 80.23%, which was higher than the non-expert’s evaluation (67.84%, 62.71%) and close to that of the expert (81.08%, 81.64%). Moreover, the convolutional neural network showed area-under-the-curve values like 0.8, 0.84 and Youden’s index like 0.6795, 0.6073, which were similar score with the expert. CONCLUSION: Although further data analysis is necessary to improve their accuracy, convolutional neural networks would be helpful to detect acral melanoma from dermoscopy images of the hands and feet.","Yu, Chanki; Yang, Sejung; Kim, Wonoh; Jung, Jinwoong; Chung, Kee-Yang; Lee, Sang Wook; Oh, Byungho",PLoS One,348,1

Viral infections are a frequent cause of inflammatory heart muscle diseases and thus also responsible for myocardial damage in the initial phase. In the past, evidence for enterovirus, adenovirus, and cytomegalovirus was in the focus of attention. In the meantime, “new” cardiotropic pathogens such as parvovirus B19, Epstein-Barr virus, and human herpesvirus 6 have been detected in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy with and without inflammation. Their persistence in the myocardium correlates with a decline in pumping capability within 6 months. While the virus is still being eliminated, the second phase of the disease begins, which is characterized by autoimmune phenomena and often a cardiac inflammatory response which likewise correlates with a worsening prognosis. The transition to the third and final phase with development of dilated cardiomyopathy occurs gradually and can take years. The goal of every diagnostic and therapeutic intervention must be to eradicate the virus and eliminate the inflammatory response to prevent the disease from progressing to terminal cardiac insufficiency.","Pankuweit, S.; Maisch, B.",Internist (Berl),348,1

To achieve equivalent protective efficacy in the absence of EP, we evaluated VEEV and EBOV DNA vaccines constructed using minimalized Nanoplasmid expression vectors that are smaller than conventional plasmids used for DNA vaccination. These vectors may also be designed to co-express type I interferon inducing innate immune agonist genes that have an adjuvant effect. Nanoplasmid vaccinated mice had increased antibody responses as compared to those receiving our conventional pWRG7077-based vaccines when delivered by IM injection, and these responses were further enhanced by the inclusion of the innate immune agonist genes. The Nanoplasmid VEEV DNA vaccines also significantly increased protection against aerosol VEEV challenge as compared to the pWRG7077 VEEV DNA vaccine. Although all mice receiving the pWRG7077 and Nanoplasmid EBOV DNA vaccines at the dose tested survived EBOV challenge, only mice receiving the Nanoplasmid EBOV DNA vaccine that co-expresses the innate immune agonist genes failed to lose weight after challenge. Our results suggest that Nanoplasmid vectors can improve the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of alphavirus and filovirus DNA vaccines.","Suschak, John J.; Dupuy, Lesley C.; Shoemaker, Charles J.; Six, Carolyn; Kwilas, Steven A.; Spik, Kristin W.; Williams, James A.; Schmaljohn, Connie S.",Mol Ther Methods Clin Dev,348,22

We had the opportunity to examine the clinical and histopathological features of several patients who were divided into 3 groups. The first group included 8 COVID-19–positive patients who were hospitalized and quarantined at home. The second group included children and young adults who presented with chilblain erythema, erythema multiforme, and urticaria-like lesions. This group of patients was negative for the COVID-19 gene sequences by polymerase chain reaction but had a high risk of COVID-19 infection. The third group included clinically heterogeneous and challenging lesions. These patients were not subject to either polymerase chain reaction tests or serological analyses because they sought dermatological attention only for a dermatosis. The histopathological analysis of these cases showed a wide spectrum of histopathological patterns. What appears to be constant in all skin biopsies was the presence of prominent dilated blood vessels with a swollen endothelial layer, vessels engulfed with red blood cells, and perivascular infiltrates, consisting mainly of cytotoxic CD8+ lymphocytes and eosinophils. In 2 cases, there was diffuse coagulopathy in the cutaneous vascular plexus. In the early phases of the disease, there were numerous collections of Langerhans cells in the epidermis after being activated by the virus. The presence of urticarial lesions, chilblains, targetoid lesions (erythema multiforme–like lesions), exanthema, maculohemorrhagic rash, or chickenpox-like lesions associated with the histopathological features mentioned previously should cause clinical dermatologists to suspect the possibility of COVID-19 infection, especially in patients with fever and cough.","Gianotti, Raffaele; Recalcati, Sebastiano; Fantini, Fabrizio; Riva, Cristina; Milani, Mario; Dainese, Emanuele; Boggio, Francesca",Am J Dermatopathol,348,1

Therapeutic potential of stem cell for treatment of neurodegenerative disorders was identified in 1980 when fetal nerve tissue was used to treat Parkinson’s disease (PD). Then, extensive studies have been conducted to develop this treatment strategy for neurological disease therapy. Today, stem cells and their secretion are well-known as a therapeutic environment for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. This new paradigm has demonstrated special characteristics related to this treatment, including neuroprotective and neurodegeneration, remyelination, reduction of neural inflammation, and recovery of function after induced injury. However, the exact mechanism of stem cells in repairing nerve damage is not yet clear; exosomes derived from them, an important part of their secretion, are introduced as responsible for an important part of such effects. Numerous studies over the past few decades have evaluated the therapeutic potential of exosomes in the treatment of various neurological diseases. In this review, after recalling the features and therapeutic history, we will discuss the latest stem cell-derived exosome-based therapies for these diseases.","Fayazi, Nashmin; Sheykhhasan, Mohsen; Soleimani Asl, Sara; Najafi, Rezvan",Mol Neurobiol,348,1

This article presents the first systematic review of studies conducted in the last 10 years on the resistance of Musa spp. to Fusarium wilt. We evaluated articles deposited in different academic databases, using a standardized search string and predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. We note that the information on the sequencing of the Musa sp. genome is certainly a source for obtaining resistant cultivars, mainly by evaluating the banana transcriptome data after infection with FOC. We also showed that there are sources of resistance to FOC race 1 (R1) and FOC TR4 in banana germplasms and that these data are the basis for obtaining resistant cultivars, although the published data are still scarce. In contrast, the transgenics approach has been adopted frequently. We propose harmonizing methods and protocols to facilitate the comparison of information obtained in different research centers and efforts based on global cooperation to cope with the disease. Thus, we offer here a contribution that may facilitate and direct research towards the production of banana resistant to FOC.","Rocha, Anelita de Jesus; Soares, Julianna Matos da Silva; Nascimento, Fernanda dos Santos; Santos, Adriadna Souza; Amorim, Vanusia Batista de Oliveira; Ferreira, Claudia Fortes; Haddad, Fernando; dos Santos-Serejo, Janay Almeida; Amorim, Edson Perito",J Fungi (Basel),348,13

The impact of regulated minimum patient-to-nurse staffing ratios in acute care hospitals in NY is unknown. OBJECTIVES: To examine variation in patient-to-nurse staffing in NY hospitals and its association with adverse outcomes (ie, mortality and avoidable costs). RESEARCH DESIGN: Cross-sectional data on nurse staffing in 116 acute care general hospitals in NY are linked with Medicare claims data. SUBJECTS: A total of 417,861 Medicare medical and surgical patients. MEASURES: Patient-to-nurse staffing is the primary predictor variable. Outcomes include in-hospital mortality, length of stay, 30-day readmission, and estimated costs using Medicare-specific cost-to-charge ratios. RESULTS: Hospital staffing ranged from 4.3 to 10.5 patients per nurse (P/N), and averaged 6.3 P/N. After adjusting for potential confounders each additional patient per nurse, for surgical and medical patients, respectively, was associated with higher odds of in-hospital mortality [odds ratio (OR)=1.13, P=0.0262; OR=1.13, P=0.0019], longer lengths of stay (incidence rate ratio=1.09, P=0.0008; incidence rate ratio=1.05, P=0.0023), and higher odds of 30-day readmission (OR=1.08, P=0.0002; OR=1.06, P=0.0003). Were hospitals staffed at the 4:1 P/N ratio proposed in the legislation, we conservatively estimated 4370 lives saved and $720 million saved over the 2-year study period in shorter lengths of stay and avoided readmissions. CONCLUSIONS: Patient-to-nurse staffing varies substantially across NY hospitals and higher ratios adversely affect patients. Our estimates of potential lives and costs saved substantially underestimate potential benefits of improved hospital nurse staffing.","Lasater, Karen B.; Aiken, Linda H.; Sloane, Douglas M.; French, Rachel; Anusiewicz, Colleen V.; Martin, Brendan; Reneau, Kyrani; Alexander, Maryann; McHugh, Matthew D.",Med Care,348,13

Nevertheless, its exact biological role was unknown. The objective of this study was to determine the associations of serum IL-37 with the severity and prognosis in CAP patients based on a retrospective cohort study. METHODS: The whole of 120 healthy subjects and 240 CAP patients were summoned. Peripheral blood was collected and IL-37 was detected using ELISA. RESULTS: Serum IL-37 was obviously decreased in CAP patients on admission. In addition, serum IL-37 was gradually decreased in parallel with CAP severity scores. Correlative analysis revealed that serum IL-37 was negatively associated with CAP severity scores and inflammatory cytokines. Further logistical regression found that reduction of serum IL-37 augmented the severity of CAP patients. Moreover, the follow-up research was performed in CAP patients. Serum lower IL-37 on admission prolonged the hospital stay in CAP patients. Serum IL-37 combination with PSI and CURB-65 had a stronger predictive capacity for death than IL-37 and CAP severity score alone in CAP patients. CONCLUSION: There are remarkably negative correlations between serum IL-37 with the severity and prognosis in CAP patients. Serum IL-37 on admission prolongs the hospital stay, demonstrating that IL-37 may involve in the process of CAP. Serum IL-37 may be regarded as a biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis for CAP patients.","Wang, Jia-Le; Chen, Xue; Xu, Yi; Chen, Yue-Xin; Wang, Jing; Liu, Yu-Lu; Song, Hai-Tao; Fei, Jun; Zhao, Hui; Fu, Lin",Front Immunol,348,13

A systematic literature review was conducted to better understand the burden of AA from the patient perspective. METHODS: Embase, MEDLINE and Cochrane databases were searched for published studies (2008–2018) reporting on assessments of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) for patients with AA. Qualitative, and quantitative data were collected. RESULTS: The review included 37 studies encompassing a range of clinical outcome assessment (COA) tools. None of the COA tools were specific for AA, and only one study used the Hairdex scale, which was designed to evaluate HRQoL in patients with disorders of the hair and scalp. All studies reported substantial impact on HRQoL due to AA, both overall and in domains related to personality (i.e. temperament and character), emotions and social functioning. Acute stress was also noted, and several studies identified lack of emotional awareness (alexithymia) in 23–50% of the patients with AA. CONCLUSIONS: Although it is well-established that patients with AA experience anxiety and depression, they also experience a decrease in HRQoL in many other areas, including personality, emotions, behaviors and social functioning, and these changes may be accompanied by acute stress and alexithymia. There is a need to achieve consensus on a core set of measures for AA and to develop and validate AA-specific measurement tools for use in future studies, to attain a clearer understanding of the impact of AA on patients.

Increasing consumption of F&V may also benefit planetary health if these foods are substituted for foods with higher environmental footprints such as red meat or dairy. The retail food environment (RFE) is an influential junction between the food system and individual diets as it drives access to F&V through external (physical access) and personal (availability, affordability, acceptability) domains. We performed a systematic search of six literature databases (January 2021) for studies assessing access to F&V in the RFE and its association with F&V consumption in adults in high- and upper-middle income countries. 36 studies were identified and categorised by dimensions of food access – accessibility, affordability, acceptability, availability and accommodation. More than half of the studies (n = 20) were based in the USA. F&V accessibility was the most commonly reported dimension (n = 29); no study reported on accommodation. 6 studies were rated to be high quality. A positive association of increased availability of F&V options in the RFE with intake was identified in 9 of 15 studies. Associations in both acceptability and accessibility dimensions were inconsistent. No association was observed between F&V affordability and consumption although available data were limited. Many challenges exist to building a robust evidence base within food environment research including conceptual, definitional and methodological heterogeneity and measurement standardisation. Future food policies should consider multi-dimensional interventions to promote access to F&V in the RFE across all domains.","Turner, Grace; Green, Rosemary; Alae-Carew, Carmelia; Dangour, Alan D.",Glob Food Sec,348,17

However, few studies have described the practical aspects of the recruitment process or compared electronic recruitment methods to in-person recruitment, particularly across health systems. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to describe the steps and efficiency of the recruitment process and participant characteristics by recruitment strategy. METHODS: EHR-based eligibility criteria included being an adult patient engaged in outpatient primary or bariatric surgery care at one of 5 health systems in the PaTH Clinical Research Network and having ≥2 weight measurements and 1 height measurement recorded in their EHR within the last 5 years. Recruitment strategies varied by site and included one or more of the following methods: (1) in-person recruitment by study staff from clinical sites, (2) US postal mail recruitment letters, (3) secure email, and (4) direct EHR recruitment through secure patient web portals. We used descriptive statistics to evaluate participant characteristics and proportion of patients recruited (ie, efficiency) by modality. RESULTS: The total number of eligible patients from the 5 health systems was 5,051,187. Of these, 40,048 (0.8%) were invited to enter an EHR-based cohort study and 1085 were enrolled. Recruitment efficiency was highest for in-person recruitment (33.5%), followed by electronic messaging (2.9%), including email (2.9%) and EHR patient portal messages (2.9%). Overall, 779 (65.7%) patients were enrolled through electronic messaging, which also showed greater rates of recruitment of Black patients compared with the other strategies. CONCLUSIONS: We recruited a total of 1085 patients from primary care and bariatric surgery settings using 4 recruitment strategies.

In this retrospective cohort study we assessed the pneumococcal serotype distribution in relation to predisposing factors, clinical manifestations and outcome during seven years after PCV introduction. METHODS: Clinical data from 1278 patients with 1304 episodes of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) between January 2009 and December 2015 in Region Västra Götaland, Sweden, were retrospectively collected from medical records. Pneumococcal isolates were serotyped by gel diffusion and/or Quellung reactions performed at the Public Health Agency in Sweden. Associations between serotypes and clinical characteristics were statistically evaluated by use of Fisher’s exact test, Mann-Whitney U test and Logistic regression analysis, whereas IPD episodes caused by serotypes over time were analyzed by Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test. RESULTS: With the exception of serotype 3, the prevalence of PCV13 serotypes decreased during the study period, from 76% (n = 157) of all IPD episodes in 2009 to 25% (n = 42) in 2015 (p < 0.001) while non-PCV13 serotypes increased, mainly among patients ≥65 years and in patients with predisposing factors, including cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease and malignancy (p < 0.001 for all). Patients with predisposing factors, including those with malignancy, immune deficiency or renal disease, were more likely to have IPD caused by a serotype not included in PCV13 rather than a vaccine-included serotype. Serotype 3 was associated with intensive care unit admissions while serotype 1 and 7F caused IPD among healthier and younger patients. PCV13 serotypes were associated with invasive pneumonia, and non-PCV13 serotypes were associated with bacteremia with unknown focus and with manifestations other than pneumonia or meningitis. CONCLUSIONS: Non-PCV13 serotypes caused the majority of IPD cases in Southwest Sweden, especially in patients ≥65 years and in patients with predisposing factors.

The C-terminal FYVE domain of EEA1 binds endosomal membranes, which contain phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI(3)P). Although it is known that FYVE binds PI(3)P specifically, it has not previously been described of how FYVE attaches and binds to endosomal membranes. In this study, we employed both coarse-grained (CG) and atomistic (AT) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to determine how FYVE binds to PI(3)P-containing membranes. CG-MD showed that the dominant membrane binding mode resembles the crystal structure of EEA1 FYVE domain in complex with inositol-1,3-diphospate (PDB ID 1JOC). FYVE, which is a homodimer, binds the membrane via a hinge mechanism, where the C-terminus of one monomer first attaches to the membrane, followed by the C-terminus of the other monomer. The estimated total binding energy is ~70 kJ/mol, of which 50–60 kJ/mol stems from specific PI(3)P-interactions. By AT-MD, we could partition the binding mode into two types: (i) adhesion by electrostatic FYVE-PI(3)P interaction, and (ii) insertion of amphipathic loops. The AT simulations also demonstrated flexibility within the FYVE homodimer between the C-terminal heads and coiled-coil stem.

With the expected exit of the United Kingdom (UK) from the European Union (EU), the prospect of regional disintegration has brought about a new impetus to studying trade policy effects. Using actual and forecast data for a panel of bilateral imports between the EU15 and the rest of the world, this paper examines the trade effects of EU economic integration agreements (EIAs), their evolution over time and the related counterfactual Brexit trade policy scenarios. Distinct trade effects are obtained for the EU trade related agreements; positive, significant and of similar magnitude for the EU and free trade agreement (FTA) coefficients, but negative and significant (and smaller in magnitude) for the regional economic partnership agreements (EPAs). The subperiod results suggest the positive coefficients of EU and FTA membership tend to diminish over time, implying earlier membership of EIAs came with greater trade benefits. Finally, in generating the predicted values for the trade effects of three alternative counterfactual Brexit scenarios (hard Brexit, hard Brexit plus, global Britain), the findings suggest an asymmetric effect depending on the perspective of the UK versus the EU. Whereas the UK’s trade would decline substantially with all three country groups (the EU, the FTAs and regional EPAs) and rise substantially with the rest of the world, only minor percentage changes are predicted for EU bilateral trade.","Stack, Marie M.; Bliss, Martin",Rev World Econ,348,1

The symptoms of COVID-19 range from mild to severe conditions. However, the physiological changes associated with COVID-19 are barely understood. In this study, we performed targeted metabolomic and lipidomic analyses of plasma from a cohort of COVID-19 patients who had experienced different symptoms. We found the metabolite and lipid alterations exhibit apparent correlation with the course of disease in these COVID-19 patients, indicating that the development of COVID-19 affected whole-body metabolism of the patients. In particular, malic acid of the TCA cycle and carbamoyl phosphate of urea cycle reveal the altered energy metabolism and hepatic dysfunction, respectively. It should be noted that carbamoyl phosphate is profoundly down-regulated in fatal patients compared with mild patients. And more importantly, guanosine monophosphate (GMP), which is mediated by not only GMP synthase but also CD39 and CD73, is significantly changed between healthy subjects and COVID-19 patients, as well as between the mild and fatal groups. In addition, the dyslipidaemia was observed in COVID-19 patients. Overall, the disturbed metabolic patterns have been found to align with the progress and severity of COVID-19.

That is because, in today’s rapid-changing business environment, managers and executives need to be able to gain crucial insights about the ongoing project in as little time as possible. Recently, energy efficiency has become a greater field of research, and companies started concentrating on monitoring energy-related metrics. In addition, many of them have built their own internal tools (dashboards) to do just this. However, one of the major drawbacks of building specialized tools is the lack of adaptability. That is, they are often tailored to only one person (e.g. CEO), or a small group of them (e.g. board of directors, managers). Furthermore, the combination of metrics that is displayed to them does not change over time. This is a problem because most likely there exists a better metric combination that would allow users to get the crucial insights faster. To fill this gap, our ongoing research focuses on making the dashboards adaptable to multiple roles within the organization while optimizing for a certain goal. In some scenarios the dashboard’s goal may be to detect defects, in others it may be to generate the most profit. As our primary research interest is to amplify energy efficiency, we have chosen that to be our dashboard’s goal. Our previous work suggests that in order to handle compound metrics at scale it is needed to represent the dashboard as a complex system. This paper presents the design and the architecture of our proposed solution synergizing the notions from complexity theory, software architecture and user experience (UX) design.","Ergasheva, Shokhista; Ivanov, Vladimir; Khomyakov, Ilya; Kruglov, Artem; Strugar, Dragos; Succi, Giancarlo",Open Source Systems,348,13

Starting from the premise that nationalism is a global and ubiquitous idea in the contemporary world, it explores whether exclusionary tendencies have been reinforced by the pandemic. The pandemic and government responses will not necessarily trigger the increase in exclusionary nationalism that both far-right politicians and observers have noted. However, there are 4 aspects, examined in the article, that might be shaped by the pandemic. These include the recent trajectory of nationalism and its social relevance prior to the pandemic,the rise of authoritarianism as governments suspend or reduce democratic freedoms and civil liberties, the rise of biases against some groups associated with the pandemic, the rise of borders and deglobalization, and the politics of fear. Thus, while the rise of exclusionary nationalism might not be the inevitable consequence of the pandemic, it risks reinforcing preexisting nationalist dynamics.","Bieber, Florian",,348,1

Fibrocytes are bone marrow-derived cells that traffic to injured tissues and contribute to fibrosis; hence their concentration in the peripheral blood has the potential to serve as a biomarker of lung fibrogenesis. We therefore sought to test the hypothesis that the concentration and phenotype of circulating fibrocytes in patients with ARDS predicts clinical outcomes. METHODS: For the animal studies, C57Bl/6 mice were infected with experimental Klebsiella pneumoniae in a model of acute lung injury; one-way ANOVA was used to compare multiple groups and two-way ANOVA was used to compare two groups over time. For the human study, 42 subjects with ARDS and 12 subjects with pneumonia (without ARDS) were compared to healthy controls. Chi-squared or Fisher’s exact test were used to compare binary outcomes. Survival data was expressed using a Kaplan-Meier curve and compared by log-rank test. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression were used to predict death. RESULTS: In mice with acute lung injury caused by Klebsiella pneumonia, there was a time-dependent increase in lung soluble collagen that correlated with sequential expansion of fibrocytes in the bone marrow, blood, and then lung compartments. Correspondingly, when compared via cross-sectional analysis, the initial concentration of blood fibrocytes was elevated in human subjects with ARDS or pneumonia as compared to healthy controls. In addition, fibrocytes from subjects with ARDS displayed an activated phenotype and on serial measurements, exhibited intermittent episodes of markedly elevated concentration over a median of 1 week. A peak concentration of circulating fibrocytes above a threshold of > 4.8 × 10(6) cells/mL cells correlated with mortality that was independent of age, ratio of arterial oxygen concentration to the fraction of inspired oxygen, and vasopressor requirement. CONCLUSIONS: Circulating fibrocytes increase in a murine model of acute lung injury and elevation in the number of these cells above a certain threshold is correlated with mortality in human ARDS. Therefore, these cells may provide a useful and easily measured biomarker to predict outcomes in these patients.","Lin, Christine M.; Alrbiaan, Abdullah; Odackal, John; Zhang, Zhimin; Scindia, Yogesh; Sung, Sun-Sang J.; Burdick, Marie D.; Mehrad, Borna",Mol Med,348,1

One such qualitative study suggests the 9-Factor Theory of Scrum Master roles, which claims that the Scrum Master performs a set of 9 leadership roles which are transferred to the team over time [14]. We aimed at conducting a quantitative exploration that examines the presence and change of the 9-Factor Theory in relation to team maturity. We conducted an online survey with 67 individuals at the conglomerate Robert Bosch GmbH. Descriptive statistics reveal that the Scrum Master and the agile team score differently on the 9 factors and that the Scrum Master role is most often distributed in teams that had been working between 3 and 5 months in an agile manner. Yet, we also find that the leadership roles predominantly remain with one dedicated Scrum Master. Based on our results we suggest to group the 9-Factor Theory into three clusters: the Scrum Master is rather linked to psychological team factors (1), while the team tends to be linked to rather product-related factors (2). Organizational factors (3) are less often present. Our practical implications suggest an extension of the Scrum Master description.

Applying an effective risk management is in the nature of agile methods. However, when multiple agile teams work on the same product, a higher coordination effort is required and more formal practices are applied. The objective of this paper is to study how risk management can be improved in a scaled agile environment. Therefore, we conducted a case study in a large-sized ecommerce company and interviewed several project managers. The results show that there are differences for risk management in terms of two contexts. On the one hand, informal risk management is rated as good enough for one autonomous team. On the other hand, more formal approaches are needed, when several teams work on the same requirement. Furthermore, a tool for the support of risk management in a scaled agile environment is presented. We can conclude that hybrid development approaches consisting of agile practices and traditional practices, are beneficial, when several teams work in parallel.","Schön, Eva-Maria; Radtke, Dirk; Jordan, Christian",Agile Processes in Software Engineering and Extreme Programming,348,1

Often, these companies develop a set of features without a better understanding of customer needs. An experiment-based approach to validate hypotheses about the customer and market could increase their chance of success or, at least, accelerate their realization of the product worthlessness. The first step of an experiment-based approach is to elicit hypotheses to guide experiments. Software startups base their products on business assumptions, but there is a lack of understanding of how these assumptions are formed and how teams could elicit hypotheses systematically. To fill this gap, we performed an empirical study consisted of two steps. First, we explored based on which assumptions startups define their products using a multiple case study. The results indicate that these companies developed their products based on founders’ assumptions derived from their previous experience. Second, we investigated cognitive mapping as a tool to elicit hypotheses systematically with two software startups. The results indicate that this approach can serve as the basis of a method to elicit hypotheses in early-stage software startups.","Melegati, Jorge; Wang, Xiaofeng",Agile Processes in Software Engineering and Extreme Programming,348,1

Writing good BDD suites, however, is challenging. A typical suite can contain hundreds of individual scenarios, that must correctly specify the system as a whole as well as individually. Despite much discussion amongst practitioners and in the blogosphere, as yet no formal definition of what makes for a high quality BDD suite has been given. To shed light on this, we surveyed BDD practitioners, asking for their opinions on the quality criteria that are important for BDD suites. We proposed, and asked for opinions on, four quality principles, and gave practitioners the option to add more principles of their own.

The proposed framework follows two main phases: a local prediction scheme for recruitments' success at the level of a single job placement, and a mathematical model that provides a global recruitment optimization scheme for the organization, taking into account multilevel considerations. In the first phase, a key property of the proposed prediction approach is the interpretability of the machine learning (ML) model, which in this case is obtained by applying the Variable-Order Bayesian Network (VOBN) model to the recruitment data. Specifically, we used a uniquely large dataset that contains recruitment records of hundreds of thousands of employees over a decade and represents a wide range of heterogeneous populations. Our analysis shows that the VOBN model can provide both high accuracy and interpretability insights to HR professionals. Moreover, we show that using the interpretable VOBN can lead to unexpected and sometimes counter-intuitive insights that might otherwise be overlooked by recruiters who rely on conventional methods. We demonstrate that it is feasible to predict the successful placement of a candidate in a specific position at a pre-hire stage and utilize predictions to devise a global optimization model. Our results show that in comparison to actual recruitment decisions, the devised framework is capable of providing a balanced recruitment plan while improving both diversity and recruitment success rates, despite the inherent trade-off between the two.","Pessach, Dana; Singer, Gonen; Avrahami, Dan; Chalutz Ben-Gal, Hila; Shmueli, Erez; Ben-Gal, Irad",Decis Support Syst,348,13

Even today, bacteria and viruses remain one of the most successful life forms and are among the most abundant. Unlike some eukaryotic cells, bacteria are not able to engulf particulate foodstuffs. Instead, they must rely entirely on diffusion. Bacteria come in many shapes and forms; they can be spherical, rod-like, spiral, filamentous, comma-like, square, or ring-like. One of the primary functions of these various designs is to increase the surface area to volume relationship; the greater the surface area, the greater the likelihood of encountering a diffusing substrate. Receptor proteins, transport proteins, and specialized pores must also contribute to ingestion, but it is the overall cellular design that provides a fundamental advantage. The structure of viruses reflects their association with the extracellular and intracellular environment. In its extracellular environment, viruses are in the form of mature virions that are capable of protecting their sensitive genomes and transmitting their genetic information to new susceptible cells. In its intracellular environment, the protective coat is no longer needed and the virus structure changes.

Prevention of Glӓsser’s disease in pigs has been plagued with an inability to design broadly protective vaccines, as many bacterin based platforms generate serovar or strain specific immunity. Subunit vaccines are of interest to provide protective immunity to multiple strains of G. parasuis. Selected proteins for subunit vaccination should be widespread, highly conserved, and surface exposed. RESULTS: Two candidate proteins for subunit vaccination (RlpB and VacJ) against G. parasuis were identified using random mutagenesis and an in vitro organ culture system. Pigs were vaccinated with recombinant RlpB and VacJ, outer membrane proteins with important contributions to cellular function and viability. Though high antibody titers to the recombinant proteins and increased interferon-γ producing cells were found in subunit vaccinated animals, the pigs were not protected from developing systemic disease. CONCLUSIONS: It appears there may be insufficient RlpB and VacJ exposed on the bacterial surface for antibody to bind, preventing high RlpB and VacJ specific antibody titers from protecting animals from G. parasuis. Additionally, this work confirms the importance of utilizing the natural host species when assessing the efficacy of vaccine candidates.","Hau, Samantha J.; Luan, Shi-Lu; Loving, Crystal L.; Nicholson, Tracy L.; Wang, Jinhong; Peters, Sarah E.; Seilly, David; Weinert, Lucy A.; Langford, Paul R.; Rycroft, Andrew N.; Wren, Brendan W.; Maskell, Duncan J.; Tucker, Alexander W.; Brockmeier, Susan L.",BMC Vet Res,348,1

Some centers utilize a unique “open” ICU structure, where primary services longitudinally follow patients who become critically ill into the ICU with intensivist comanagement. The impact of open ICUs on patient care and education of trainees has not been well-characterized. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to characterize affordances and barriers to education and patient care, from the perspectives of hospitalists and intensivists teaching in the ICU. DESIGN: We conducted semi-structured interviews with hospitalist and intensivist faculty at a large academic medical center with an open ICU structure. We coded deidentified interview transcripts to inductively analyze the data for themes and subthemes. PARTICIPANTS: We recruited hospitalist and intensivist faculty members who attend on teaching services in the open ICU system. APPROACH: Given the complexity of multiple teachers and learners in the ICU environment, we selected shared mental models as our primary theoretical lens through which we analyzed and interpreted our data. KEY RESULTS: We identified three main themes regarding education in the open ICU system: (1) communication challenges, (2) educational barriers and affordances, and (3) structural barriers and affordances. Hospitalists and intensivists agreed on some barriers and facilitators to education, such as continuity of care, yet they disagreed on others. Specifically, hospitalists and intensivists had a shared mental model regarding barriers to patient care and education in the open ICU structure, but had divergent opinions regarding the affordances of the structure, such as continuity and availability of ICU expertise. CONCLUSIONS: The open ICU environment presents facilitators and barriers to trainee education and patient care. Our findings can be leveraged to improve communication, education, and patient care on both hospitalist and ICU teams.

However, in contrast to business process diagrams, where nowadays BPMN prevails, process landscape diagrams lack standardization, which results in numerous process landscape designs. Accordingly, our goal was to investigate how intuitive are current landscape designs to users with low expertise, as well as users having expertise in BPMN and landscape modeling. A total of 302 subjects participated in the research showing that previous expertise impacts the interpretation of landscape elements and designs whereas, in the case of having contextual information, subjects responded more consistently. The results also show that the basic relationships between processes are intuitive to users, also in the case when only proximity between shapes is facilitated. Our findings may imply future designs of languages for process landscapes. They also may be useful for those who actually model process landscape diagrams and search for suitable notations.","Polančič, Gregor; Brin, Pavlo; Heloisa Thom, Lucineia; Sosa, Encarna; Kocbek Bule, Mateja","Enterprise, Business-Process and Information Systems Modeling",348,1

Consequently, the adoption of MSA is expected to particularly benefit the scalability, maintainability, and reliability of monolithic systems. However, MSA adoption also increases architectural complexity in service design, implementation, and operation. As a result, Software Architecture Reconstruction (SAR) of microservice architectures is aggravated. This paper presents a modeling method that systematizes SAR of microservice architectures with the goal to facilitate its execution. The method yields reconstruction models for certain architecture viewpoints in MSA to enable efficient architecture analysis. We validate the method’s applicability by means of a case study architecture and the assessment of its risk in technical debt using derived reconstruction models.","Rademacher, Florian; Sachweh, Sabine; Zündorf, Albert","Enterprise, Business-Process and Information Systems Modeling",348,13

During this period, among the 1893 patients requiring VA-ECMO support, 112 (5.9%) developed an ECMO-related neurovascular injury: 65 (3.4%) ischemic strokes, 40 (2.1%) intracranial bleeding, one cerebral thrombophlebitis (0.05%) and 6 (0.3%) spinal cord infarction.

At our institution, this had led to the earlier use of HFOV and promoted a change in the treatment strategy involving the use of higher frequencies (above 15 Hz) and lower high-frequency tidal volumes (VThf). The purpose of this observational study was to assess how survival without bronchopulmonary dysplasia grades 2 and 3 (SF-BPD) is influenced by these modifications in the respiratory strategy applied to preterm infants (gestational age < 32 weeks at birth) who required mechanical ventilation (MV) in the first 3 days of life. We compared a baseline period (2012–2013) against a period in which this strategy had been fully implemented (2016–2017).

Yet, burnout itself—what constitutes it, what factors contribute to its development, and what the wider consequences are for individuals, organisations, or their patients—is rarely made explicit. We aimed to provide a comprehensive summary of research that examines theorised relationships between burnout and other variables, in order to determine what is known (and not known) about the causes and consequences of burnout in nursing, and how this relates to theories of burnout. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO. We included quantitative primary empirical studies (published in English) which examined associations between burnout and work-related factors in the nursing workforce. RESULTS: Ninety-one papers were identified. The majority (n = 87) were cross-sectional studies; 39 studies used all three subscales of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) Scale to measure burnout. As hypothesised by Maslach, we identified high workload, value incongruence, low control over the job, low decision latitude, poor social climate/social support, and low rewards as predictors of burnout. Maslach suggested that turnover, sickness absence, and general health were effects of burnout; however, we identified relationships only with general health and sickness absence. Other factors that were classified as predictors of burnout in the nursing literature were low/inadequate nurse staffing levels, ≥ 12-h shifts, low schedule flexibility, time pressure, high job and psychological demands, low task variety, role conflict, low autonomy, negative nurse-physician relationship, poor supervisor/leader support, poor leadership, negative team relationship, and job insecurity. Among the outcomes of burnout, we found reduced job performance, poor quality of care, poor patient safety, adverse events, patient negative experience, medication errors, infections, patient falls, and intention to leave. CONCLUSIONS: The patterns identified by these studies consistently show that adverse job characteristics—high workload, low staffing levels, long shifts, and low control—are associated with burnout in nursing. The potential consequences for staff and patients are severe. The literature on burnout in nursing partly supports Maslach’s theory, but some areas are insufficiently tested, in particular, the association between burnout and turnover, and relationships were found for some MBI dimensions only.","Dall’Ora, Chiara; Ball, Jane; Reinius, Maria; Griffiths, Peter",Hum Resour Health,348,1

However, these successes have been restricted to monotonic logics. Recent work proposed the notion of strong inconsistency for a number of non-monotonic logics, including Answer Set Programming (ASP). This paper shows how algorithms for reasoning about inconsistency in monotonic logics can be extended to the case of ASP programs, in the concrete case of strong inconsistency. Initial experimental results illustrate the potential of the proposed approach.","Mencía, Carlos; Marques-Silva, Joao",Theory and Applications of Satisfiability Testing - SAT 2020,348,1

[Formula: see text] has chromatic number k and there is a short informal proof of this fact, yet finding proofs of it via automated reasoning techniques has proved to be a challenging task. In this paper, we study the complexity of clausal proofs of the uncolorability of [Formula: see text] with [Formula: see text] colors. In particular, we consider variants of the [Formula: see text] (propagation redundancy) proof system that are without new variables, and with or without deletion. These proof systems are of interest due to their potential uses for proof search. As our main result, we present a sublinear-length and constant-width [Formula: see text] proof without new variables or deletion. We also implement a proof generator and verify the correctness of our proof. Furthermore, we consider formulas extended with clauses from the proof until a short resolution proof exists, and investigate the performance of CDCL in finding the short proof. This turns out to be difficult for CDCL with the standard heuristics. Finally, we describe an approach inspired by SAT sweeping to find proofs of these extended formulas.","Yolcu, Emre; Wu, Xinyu; Heule, Marijn J.

Platelets may interact with parasitized erythrocytes, leukocytes and endothelium. These interactions can lead to microvessel obstructions and induce release of inflammatory mediators. Induction of the haem oxygenase enzyme is important in the host’s response to free haem and to several other molecules generated by infectious or non-infectious diseases. In addition, an important role for the haem oxygenase-1 isotype has been demonstrated in experimental cerebral malaria and in clinical cases. Therefore, the present work aims to determine the influence of haem oxygenase in thrombocytopaenia and acute pulmonary injury during infection with Plasmodium berghei strain NK65. METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were infected with P. berghei and analysed 7-10 days post-infection. For each experiment, Cobalt Protoporphyrin IX/CoPPIX or saline were administered. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was used for total and differential leukocyte count and for protein measurement. Lungs were used for histological analyses or for analysis of cytokines and western blotting. The lung permeability was analysed by Evans blue dye concentration. Platelet-leukocyte aggregate formation was assayed using the flow cytometer. RESULTS: Plasmodium berghei NK65 infection generated an intense lung injury, with increased levels of inflammatory mediators, oedema, and cell migration into the lung. Plasmodium berghei infection was also accompanied by marked thrombocytopaenia and formation of platelet-leukocyte aggregates in peripheral blood. Treatment with the HO-1 inducer cobalt protoporphyrin IX (CoPPIX) modified the inflammatory response but did not affect the evolution of parasitaemia. Animals treated with CoPPIX showed an improvement in lung injury, with decreased inflammatory infiltrate in the lung parenchyma, oedema and reduced thrombocytopaenia. CONCLUSION: Data here presented suggest that treatment with CoPPIX inducer leads to less severe pulmonary lung injury and thrombocytopaenia during malaria infection, thus increasing animal survival.","de Azevedo-Quintanilha, Isaclaudia G.; Medeiros-de-Moraes, Isabel M.; Ferreira, André C.; Reis, Patrícia A.; Vieira-de-Abreu, Adriana; Campbell, Robert A.; Weyrich, Andrew S.; Bozza, Patricia T.; Zimmerman, Guy A.; Castro-Faria-Neto, Hugo C.",Malar J,348,31

It is shown that socio-economic inequalities are currently perceived by the population as excessive and illegitimate, and the gap between expectations and social reality has led to growing requests for “leveling” being made to the state. This analysis of the perception of social inequalities is carried out against a background of the objective situation with inequalities that is characterized by the equalization of incomes in the middle layer of society and simultaneously by the growing gap between the top and the rest of the population. Key challenges and crossroads that the state faces in terms of developing socio-economic policies aimed at reducing inequalities are identified.","Mareeva, Svetlana",J,348,1

Either intermittent or continuous delivery has been considered safe and efficient. The comparative efficacy of these two modalities is inconclusive. We aimed to compare these two modalities as the first-line treatments. METHODS: An efficacy research with a retrospective cohort study design was conducted. Hospital records of children with severe asthma exacerbation admitted to Hat Yai Hospital between 2015 and 2017 were retrospectively collected. Children initially treated with continuous salbutamol 10 mg per hour or intermittent salbutamol 2.5 mg per dose over 1–4 h nebulization were matched one-to-one using the propensity score. Competing risk and risk difference regression was applied to evaluate the proportion of children who succeeded and failed the initial treatment. Restricted mean survival time regression was used to compare the length of stay (LOS) between the two groups. RESULTS: One-hundred and eighty-nine children were included. Of these children, 112 were matched for analysis (56 with continuous and 56 with intermittent nebulization). Children with continuous nebulization experienced a higher proportion of success in nebulization treatment (adjusted difference: 39.5, 95% CI 22.7, 56.3, p < 0.001), with a faster rate of success (adjusted SHR: 2.70, 95% CI 1.73, 4.22, p < 0.001). There was a tendency that LOS was also shorter (adjusted mean difference − 9.9 h, 95% CI -24.2, 4.4, p = 0.176). CONCLUSION: Continuous SABA nebulization was more efficient than intermittent nebulization in the treatment of children with severe asthma exacerbation.","Kulalert, Prapasri; Phinyo, Phichayut; Patumanond, Jayanton; Smathakanee, Chutima; Chuenjit, Wantida; Nanthapisal, Sira",Asthma Res Pract,348,13

In Brazil, the most representative collections are kept by natural history museums, whose primary focus is in invertebrates, vertebrates and vascular plants. Only a few institutions keep repositories in different kingdoms. The Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz), established in 1900, is a strategic public health institution of the Ministry of Health of Brazil. As such, Fiocruz is responsible for a wide range of activities, from basic research to the development and production of vaccines, drugs, reagents and diagnostic kits. Its biological collections were soon established in the expeditions made by naturalists and physicians seeking integrated knowledge of the fauna, flora and tropical diseases. Since then, they have been part of the institutional policy. In a few decades, those collections were already in the forefront of basic and applied research on tropical parasitic and infectious diseases. Currently, they comprise thirty-three repositories representing part of the Brazilian diversity of bacteria, fungi, protozoa, helminths, arthropods, molluscs and plants of medical and environmental importance. Different methods of long-term preservation are applied for the conservation of this wide range of organisms represented by about 6 million specimens. Herein, we describe this range of collections and discuss their complementary role as repositories of groups not represented in other biological collections in Brazil. These valuable biological materials have been used in public health and medical research, as well as for technological development and innovation in Brazil. Parallel to this specific usage, Fiocruz biological collections have played and continue to play a unique and important role in understanding and conserving part of Brazil’s biodiversity that is currently under-represented in other biological and natural history collections in Brazil and South America.","da Silva, Manuela; Chame, Marcia; Moratelli, Ricardo",Biodivers Data J,348,1

Here, we describe influenza virus strain circulation in the GIHSN participant countries during 2017–2018 season and examine factors associated with complicated hospitalization among patients admitted with laboratory-confirmed influenza illness. METHODS: The study enrolled patients who were hospitalized in a GIHSN hospital in the previous 48 h with acute respiratory symptoms and who had symptoms consistent with influenza within the 7 days before admission. Enrolled patients were tested by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction to confirm influenza virus infection. “Complicated hospitalization” was defined as a need for mechanical ventilation, admission to an intensive care unit, or in-hospital death. In each of four age strata (< 15, 15–< 50, 50–< 65, and ≥ 65 years), factors associated with complicated hospitalization in influenza-positive patients were identified by mixed effects logistic regression and those associated with length of hospital stay using a linear mixed-effects regression model. RESULTS: The study included 12,803 hospitalized patients at 14 coordinating sites in 13 countries, of which 4306 (34%) tested positive for influenza. Influenza viruses B/Yamagata, A/H3N2, and A/H1N1pdm09 strains dominated and cocirculated, although the dominant strains varied between sites. Complicated hospitalization occurred in 10.6% of influenza-positive patients. Factors associated with complicated hospitalization in influenza-positive patients included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (15–< 50 years and ≥ 65 years), diabetes (15–< 50 years), male sex (50–< 65 years), hospitalization during the last 12 months (50–< 65 years), and current smoking (≥65 years). Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (50–< 65 years), other chronic conditions (15–< 50 years), influenza A (50–< 65 years), and hospitalization during the last 12 months (< 15 years) were associated with a longer hospital stay. The proportion of patients with complicated influenza did not differ between influenza A and B. CONCLUSIONS: Complicated hospitalizations occurred in over 10% of patients hospitalized with influenza virus infection. Factors commonly associated with complicated or longer hospitalization differed by age group but commonly included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, and hospitalization during the last 12 months.","Lina, Bruno; Georges, Alexandre; Burtseva, Elena; Nunes, Marta C.; Andrew, Melissa K.; McNeil, Shelly A.; Ruiz-Palacios, Guillermo M.; Feng, Luzhao; Kyncl, Jan; Vanhems, Philippe; Ortiz, Justin R.; Paget, John; Reiner, Robert C.",BMC Infect Dis,348,1

A risk associated with its use is the development of multi-drug-resistant organisms. We hypothesized that a 1-day reduction in systemic antimicrobial exposure in the SDD regimen would not affect the outcomes of our patients. In this before-and-after study design, 199 patients and 248 patients were included in a 3-day SDD group and a 2-day SDD group, respectively. The rates of hospital-acquired pneumonia and ICU infections were similar in both groups. The rates of bloodstream infection and bacteriuria were significantly lower in the 2-day SDD group than in the 3-day SDD group. Compared with the patients in the 3-day group, the patients in the 2-day SDD group received fewer antibiotics and less exposure to mechanical ventilation, and they used fewer ICU resources. The rates of ICU mortality and 28-day mortality were similar in both groups. The incidence of multi-drug-resistant organisms was similar in both groups. Within the limitations inherent to our study design, reducing the exposure of prophylactic systemic antibiotics in the SDD setting from 3 days to 2 days was not associated with impaired outcomes. Future randomized controlled trials should be conducted to test this hypothesis and investigate the effects on the development of multi-drug resistant organisms.

However, there is limited understanding of how the nature of ambulance work contributes to this problem, the significant large toll that emergency medical response takes on the individual, and particularly about late and cumulative development of work-related distress among this first responder workforce. METHODS: This study examined peer-reviewed qualitative research published from 2000 to 2018 to outline the effect of emergency medical response work on the psychological, psychosocial, and physical health of paramedics, ambulance officers, ambulance volunteers, and call-takers. Databases searched included: Ovid Medline, CINAHL, Ovid EMcare, PsychInfo and Scopus. The systematic review was organised around five key areas: impact of the work on psychological wellbeing; impact of psychological stress on physical wellbeing; how work-related well-being needs were articulated; effects of workflow and the nature of the work on well-being; and, effects of organisational structures on psychological and physical well-being. RESULTS: Thirty-nine articles met the eligibility criteria. Several factors present in the day-to-day work of ambulance personnel, and in how organisational management acknowledge and respond, were identified as being significant and contributing to mental health and well-being, or increasing the risk for developing conditions such as PTSD, depression, and anxiety. Ambulance personnel articulated their well-being needs across four key areas: organisational support; informal support; use of humour; and individual mechanisms to cope such as detachment and external supports. CONCLUSIONS: Interactions between critical incidents and workplace culture and demands have an overwhelming impact on the psychological, physical and social well-being of ambulance personnel. These include day-to-day managerial actions and responses, the impact of shift work, poorly-managed rosters, and long hours of work with little time between for recovery. Mental health issues result from exposure to traumatic events, and the way managers and peers respond to worker distress. Ambulance personnel suffering from work-related stress feel abandoned by peers, management, and the service, during illness, in return-to-work, and post-retirement.

However, in cohorts of ARDS patients from the 1990s, patients more commonly died from sepsis or multi-organ failure rather than refractory hypoxemia. Given increased attention to lung-protective ventilation and sepsis treatment in the past 25 years, we hypothesized that causes of death may be different among contemporary cohorts. These differences may provide clinicians with insight into targets for future therapeutic interventions. METHODS: We identified adult patients hospitalized at a single tertiary care center (2016–2017) with AHRF, defined as PaO(2)/FiO(2) ≤ 300 while receiving invasive mechanical ventilation for > 12 h, who died during hospitalization. ARDS was adjudicated by multiple physicians using the Berlin definition. Separate abstractors blinded to ARDS status collected data on organ dysfunction and withdrawal of life support using a standardized tool. The primary cause of death was defined as the organ system that most directly contributed to death or withdrawal of life support. RESULTS: We identified 385 decedents with AHRF, of whom 127 (33%) had ARDS. The most common primary causes of death were sepsis (26%), pulmonary dysfunction (22%), and neurologic dysfunction (19%). Multi-organ failure was present in 70% at time of death, most commonly due to sepsis (50% of all patients), and 70% were on significant respiratory support at the time of death. Only 2% of patients had insupportable oxygenation or ventilation. Eighty-five percent died following withdrawal of life support. Patients with ARDS more often had pulmonary dysfunction as the primary cause of death (28% vs 19%; p = 0.04) and were also more likely to die while requiring significant respiratory support (82% vs 64%; p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In this contemporary cohort of patients with AHRF, the most common primary causes of death were sepsis and pulmonary dysfunction, but few patients had insupportable oxygenation or ventilation. The vast majority of deaths occurred after withdrawal of life support. ARDS patients were more likely to have pulmonary dysfunction as the primary cause of death and die while requiring significant respiratory support compared to patients without ARDS.","Ketcham, Scott W.; Sedhai, Yub Raj; Miller, H.

Here, using comprehensive measurements and modeling, we show the haze during the COVID lockdown were driven by enhancements of secondary pollution. In particular, large decreases in NO(x) emissions from transportation increased ozone and nighttime NO(3) radical formation, and these increases in atmospheric oxidizing capacity in turn facilitated the formation of secondary particulate matter.

On the one hand, systems dealing with strict-timing constraints in safety-critical applications mainly focused on predictability, leaving little room for complex planning and decision-making processes. Indeed, real-time techniques are very efficient in predetermined, constrained, and controlled scenarios. Nevertheless, they lack the necessary flexibility to operate in evolving settings, where the software needs to adapt to the changes of the environment. On the other hand, Intelligent Systems (IS) increasingly adopted Machine Learning (ML) techniques (e.g., subsymbolic predictors such as Neural Networks). The seminal application of those IS started in zero-risk domains producing revolutionary results. However, the ever-increasing exploitation of ML-based approaches generated opaque systems, which are nowadays no longer socially acceptable—calling for eXplainable AI (XAI). Such a problem is exacerbated when IS tend to approach safety-critical scenarios. This paper highlights the need for on-time explainability.

Utilizing the representation result for (pure) double Boolean algebras, it is established that DBL (PDBL) is sound and complete with respect to a semantics based on object oriented protoconcepts (semiconcepts).","Howlader, Prosenjit; Banerjee, Mohua",Rough Sets,348,1

In this paper, we investigate the design and implementation details of commercial anti-bot services in an effort to understand how they operate and whether they can effectively identify and block malicious bots in practice. We analyze the JavaScript code which their clients need to include in their websites and perform a set of gray box and black box analyses of their proprietary back-end logic, by simulating bots utilizing well-known automation tools and popular browsers. On the positive side, our results show that by relying on browser fingerprinting, more than 75% of protected websites in our dataset, successfully defend against attacks by basic bots built with Python scripts or PhantomJS. At the same time, by using less popular browsers in terms of automation (e.g., Safari on Mac and Chrome on Android) attackers can successfully bypass the protection of up to 82% of protected websites. Our findings show that the majority of protected websites are prone to bot attacks and the existing anti-bot solutions cannot substantially limit the ability of determined attackers. We have responsibly disclosed our findings with the anti-bot service providers.","Amin Azad, Babak; Starov, Oleksii; Laperdrix, Pierre; Nikiforakis, Nick","Detection of Intrusions and Malware, and Vulnerability Assessment",348,1

In the case where an exact intension cannot be formulated due to limited information, rough set theory introduces approximations to roughly learn the intension. Pawlak originally proposes a qualitative formulation of approximations which allows no error in the learned intension. Various quantitative formulations have been studied as generalizations, most of which use probabilistic measures. In contrast, non-probabilistic formulations have not been fully investigated. On the other hand, three-way approximations and structured approximations have been proposed to emphasize the semantics of approximations for the purpose of learning and interpreting intension. To combine the benefits of these two directions of generalizations, this paper investigates quantitative structured three-way approximations based on both probabilistic and non-probabilistic measures in the context of both complete and incomplete information.","Hu, Mengjun",Rough Sets,348,1

This paper focuses on analyzing the human understanding of the explainable agents behaviour. It conducts a preliminary human-agent interaction study to investigate the effect of explanations on the introduced bias in human-agent decision making for the human participants. We test the hypothesis where different explanation types are used to detect the bias introduced in the autonomous agents decisions. We present three user groups: Agents without explanation, and explainable agents using two different algorithms which automatically generate different explanations for agent actions. Quantitative analysis of three user groups (n = 20, 25, 20) in which users detect the bias in agents’ decisions for each explanation type for 15 test data cases is conducted for three different explanations types.

Logic locking has emerged as a prominent technique to counter these security threats by protecting the integrity of integrated circuits through functional and structural obfuscation. In recent years, a great number of locking schemes has been introduced, thereby focusing on a variety of security objectives and the resiliency against different attacks. However, several major pitfalls can be identified in the existing proposals: (i) the focus on isolated and often small circuit components, (ii) the assumption of unrealistic attack models that enable powerful attacks on logic locking and (iii) the design of very specific locking schemes targeted towards achieving resilience against specific attacks. These observations strongly impair the practicality of logic locking. Therefore, in this paper we present a holistic framework for scaling logic locking schemes to common multi-module hardware designs, thereby showcasing an industry-ready pathway of applying logic locking in a realistic design flow. The framework represents an enhancement of the previously published Inter-Lock methodology, offering several algorithmic improvements as well as toolflow implementation details to facilitate the applicability of the framework to large multi-module designs.

Yet, to provide remote access over the internet, special architectures are developed to integrate a network interface into these devices without inferring with the actual functionality. However, these architectures either lack security measures against cyber-attacks or do not offer the necessary performance for time-critical communication interfaces. To solve that, an architecture consisting of three units is introduced in this paper to provide a network interface with extensive security measures and a high performance.

This simplifies the conversion of compute intense instruction sequences into hardware structures while the system is running. The relatively high abstraction level of the Bytecode facilitates the analysis and synthesis remarkably. Yet, the native execution of the Bytecode comes with a number of drawbacks. In this contribution, we show a new instruction set architecture that preserves the high abstraction level of Bytecode while at the same time avoiding inefficient data transports.

One such region is the striatum where MORs are densely expressed, yet the role of these MOR populations in modulating reward is relatively unknown. We have begun to address this question by using a series of genetically engineered mice based on the Cre recombinase/loxP system to selectively delete MORs from specific neurons enriched in the striatum: dopamine 1 (D1) receptors, D2 receptors, adenosine 2a (A2a) receptors, and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). We first determined the effects of each deletion on opioid-induced locomotion, a striatal and dopamine-dependent behavior. We show that MOR deletion from D1 neurons reduced opioid (morphine and oxycodone)-induced hyperlocomotion, whereas deleting MORs from A2a neurons resulted in enhanced opioid-induced locomotion, and deleting MORs from D2 or ChAT neurons had no effect. We also present the effect of each deletion on opioid intravenous self-administration. We first assessed the acquisition of this behavior using remifentanil as the reinforcing opioid and found no effect of genotype. Mice were then transitioned to oxycodone as the reinforcer and maintained here for 9 d. Again, no genotype effect was found. However, when mice underwent 3 d of extinction training, during which the drug was not delivered, but all cues remained as during the maintenance phase, drug-seeking behavior was enhanced when MORs were deleted from A2a or ChAT neurons. These findings show that these selective MOR populations play specific roles in reward-associated behaviors.","Severino, Amie L.; Mittal, Nitish; Hakimian, Joshua K.; Velarde, Nathanial; Minasyan, Ani; Albert, Ralph; Torres, Carlos; Romaneschi, Nicole; Johnston, Camille; Tiwari, Suchi; Lee, Alex S.; Taylor, Anna M.; Gavériaux-Ruff, Claire; Kieffer, Brigitte L.; Evans, Christopher J.; Cahill, Catherine M.; Walwyn, Wendy M.",eNeuro,348,1

Metabolic reprogramming in immune cells mediates inflammation, and recent evidence suggests SARS-CoV-2 activates glycolysis in monocytes to facilitate cytokine production. In this study I investigated the ability of the spike protein (subunit 1) from SARS-CoV-2 to cause glycolytic reprogramming and inflammatory activation in isolated human monocytes. Primary human monocytes were isolated from healthy young donors (N=4) by immunomagnetic negative selection and stimulated with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein subunit 1 (rS1) for 6 hr. Glycolysis was monitored by assessing extracellular acidification using a Seahorse assay. Supernatants and cell lysates were subsequently processed for gene and protein expression assays by qPCR and ELISA respectively. Treatment of monocytes with rS1 at 10 nM and 30 nM led to significant upregulation of glycolysis, as well as a substantial increase in gene and protein expression of interleukin-6. Mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages did not display enhanced glycolysis when stimulated with rS1, suggesting a specific interaction of the protein with the ACE2 receptor, rather than a general inflammatory response caused by contamination with endotoxin or similar. Glycolytic activation in monocytes in response to rS1 suggests that immunometabolic modulators, including common geroprotectors such as rapamycin and metformin, may have efficacy in treating COVID-19.","Pence, Brandt",Innov Aging,348,27

There is consistent evidence of wealth-related inequality in the conditions of menstrual hygiene management spaces as well as access to sanitary pads across all countries. Wealth, education, the rural-urban divide and infrastructural limitations of the household are major contributors to these inequalities. While wealth is identified as one of the key drivers of unequal access to menstrual hygiene management, other socio-economic, environmental and household factors require urgent policy attention. This specifically includes the lack of safe MHM spaces which threaten the health and dignity of women and girls.","Rossouw, Laura; Ross, Hana",Int J Environ Res Public Health,348,1

Because it is “hidden”, the symptoms of NPC can easily be missed, and more than 70% of patients present with locally advanced disease at diagnosis. Concurrent radiation therapy with chemotherapy can significantly improve regional control of NPC. At present, distant metastasis is the main cause of treatment failure. At the end of the 20th century, clinical trial No. IG0099 in the United States confirmed the effectiveness of adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) for the first time. However, in the past 20 years, various clinical trials and meta-analyses conducted globally have yielded contradictory results regarding the effect of AC on locally advanced NPC. AC has changed from category 1 to the current category 2A in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines, and it remains controversial whether AC can significantly improve the survival of NPC patients. Here, we comprehensively analyzed the role of AC in locally advanced NPC by comparing some treatment methods. We conclude the role of AC in treating locally advanced NPC, based on the studies presented, remains undefined but is associated with increased toxicity.","Su, Lin; She, Lei; Shen, Liangfang",Front Oncol,348,7

But with Trump, a very sharp break is noticeable; he talked about global energy dominance. Exporting energy to increase relations with neighboring countries and US allies has been the focus of the Obama and Trump administrations, and this policy will be one of the basic principles of US foreign policy in the next US administration. Meanwhile, sanctions on the energy industry of different countries have also played an important role in the foreign policy of the Trump administration. During Trump’s presidency, the country had major foreign policy problems with China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia The US withdrawal from JCPOA and the imposition of sanctions on Iran’s oil exports, followed by a policy of maximum pressure on it, has been one of the key points of the Trump administration’s foreign policy. US energy independence has provided the country with the opportunity to increase energy exports to the global energy market and has even allowed the US government to use energy sanctions against major energy-producing countries. A major development in the energy market during the Trump administration was the spread of covid-19 and oil price decline. Oil prices were one of the most important challenges in US energy policy under Trump, although Trump worked hard to minimize the impact of the Coronavirus outbreak and falling oil prices on the US economy and US shale.","Shokri Kalehsar, Omid",US Energy Diplomacy in the Caspian Sea Basin,348,12

The focus is on low- and middle-income countries where 85 per cent of girls and women of menstruating age live. I draw on a combination of secondary literature and focus group discussions with women from urban slums in India. My findings suggest that a tangled web of traditional taboos, markets, and government policies have merged to create and endorse asymmetric information in menstrual health that has promoted the single product category of disposable pads. This has deeply influenced the beliefs and behavioural practices of menstruating women, which in turn have adverse implications for environmental ecosystems. It also seriously limits women’s agency in the choice of menstrual products as awareness of alternatives is negligible. Analysing women’s responses when they are offered information on other menstrual alternatives suggest that as a policy tool, ‘informed choice’ has the potential to steer the menstrual health market in a more sustainable direction. These findings are even more pertinent now in the light of the supply chain vulnerabilities exposed by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Garikipati, Supriya","Sustainable Consumption and Production, Volume I",348,1

It was shown that the number of such malicious ASs is significantly larger than previously expected due to the lack of security guarantees in the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). In response, recent works suggest alternative Tor path selection methods prefering Tor nodes with higher resilience to active BGP attacks. In this work, we analyze the implications of such proposals. We show that Counter-RAPTOR and DPSelect are not as secure as thought before: for particular users they allow for leakage of user’s location. DPSelect is not as resilient as widely accepted as we show that it achieves only one third of its originally claimed resilience and, hence, does not protect users from routing attacks. We reveal the performance implications of both methods and identify scenarios where their usage leads to significant performance bottlenecks. Finally, we propose a new metric to quantify the user’s location leakage by path selection. Using this metric and performing large-scale analysis, we show to which extent a malicious middle can fingerprint the user’s location and what kind of confidence it can achieve. Our findings shed light on the implications of path selection methods on the users’ anonymity and the need for further research.","Mitseva, Asya; Aleksandrova, Marharyta; Engel, Thomas; Panchenko, Andriy",ICT Systems Security and Privacy Protection,348,16

Simulating the SLOPOL10 model, an econometric model of the Slovenian economy, we analyse the effectiveness of various categories of public spending and taxes during the period 2020 to 2030, assuming that no crisis occurs. Our simulations show that those public spending measures that entail both demand- and supply-side effects are more effective at stimulating real GDP and increasing employment than pure demand-side measures. This is due to the fact that supply-side measures also increase potential and not only actual GDP. Measures which foster research and development and those which improve the education level of the labour force are particularly effective in this respect. Employment can also be stimulated effectively by cutting the income tax rate and the social security contribution rate, i.e. by reducing the tax wedge on labour income, which positively affects Slovenia’s international competitiveness. Successful stabilisation policies should thus contain a supply-side component in addition to a demand-side component. We also provide a first simulation of potential effects of the Covid-19 crisis on the Slovenian economy, which is modelled as a combined demand and supply shock.","Neck, Reinhard; Weyerstrass, Klaus; Blueschke, Dmitri; Verbič, Miroslav",Empirica,348,1

However, in practice, these languages are not processed atomically. During an upgrade, the infrastructure goes through a series of intermediate states. We identify a security vulnerability that occurs during an upgrade even when the initial and final states of the infrastructure are secure, and we show that those vulnerability are possible in Amazon’s AWS and Google Cloud. We call such attacks intra-update sniping vulnerabilities. In order to mitigate this shortcoming, we present a technique that detects such vulnerabilities and pinpoints the root causes of insecure deployment migrations.

Most of the techniques that achieve differential privacy are based on a judicious use of randomness. However, reasoning about randomized programs is difficult and error prone. For this reason, several techniques have been recently proposed to support designer in proving programs differentially private or in finding violations to it. In this work we propose a technique based on symbolic execution for reasoning about differential privacy. Symbolic execution is a classic technique used for testing, counterexample generation and to prove absence of bugs. Here we use symbolic execution to support these tasks specifically for differential privacy. To achieve this goal, we design a relational symbolic execution technique which supports reasoning about probabilistic coupling, a formal notion that has been shown useful to structure proofs of differential privacy.

Automated techniques for cost analysis excel at bounding the resource complexity of programs that use integer values and linear arithmetic. Unfortunately, they fall short when execution traces become more involved, esp. when data dependencies may affect the termination conditions of loops. In such cases, state-of-the-art analyzers have shown to produce loose bounds, or even no bound at all. We propose a novel technique that generalizes the common notion of recurrence relations based on ranking functions. Existing methods usually unfold one loop iteration, and examine the resulting relations between variables. These relations assist in establishing a recurrence that bounds the number of loop iterations. We propose a different approach, where we derive recurrences by comparing whole traces with whole traces of a lower rank, avoiding the need to analyze the complexity of intermediate states. We offer a set of global properties, defined with respect to whole traces, that facilitate such a comparison, and show that these properties can be checked efficiently using a handful of local conditions. To this end, we adapt state squeezers, an induction mechanism previously used for verifying safety properties. We demonstrate that this technique encompasses the reasoning power of bounded unfolding, and more. We present some seemingly innocuous, yet intricate, examples where previous tools based on cost relations and control flow analysis fail to solve, and that our squeezer-powered approach succeeds.","Ish-Shalom, Oren; Itzhaky, Shachar; Rinetzky, Noam; Shoham, Sharon",Programming Languages and Systems,348,17

We prove that (i) concolic evaluation is sound with respect to concrete evaluation; (ii) modulo concretization and SMT solver incompleteness, the search for a counter-example succeeds if a user program has a bug and (iii) this search amounts to directed evolution of inputs targeting hard-to-reach corners of the program.","You, Shu-Hung; Findler, Robert Bruce; Dimoulas, Christos",Programming Languages and Systems,348,1

Elucidating the logical structure of stability properties in this way has three key benefits: i) it provides a flexible means of formally specifying various stability properties of interest, ii) it yields rigorous proofs of those stability properties from dL’s axioms with dL’s ODE safety and liveness proof principles, and iii) it enables formal analysis of the relationships between various stability properties which, in turn, inform proofs of those properties.

The chapter examines this question in the context of America’s foreign policy traditions—nationalism, realism, conservative internationalism, and liberal internationalism. Trump is more nationalist than recent presidents, believing like George Washington and Andrew Jackson that America should stay out of the affairs of other nations unless there is an imminent threat. On the other hand, he is also a realist like Teddy Roosevelt and Richard Nixon committed to maintain the status quo and compete in the great power struggle with Russia and China. What he is not is an internationalist, either conservative who hopes to change the world through the spread of democracy like Ronald Reagan or liberal who seeks to strengthen international institutions and trade like Bill Clinton. Nevertheless, he is not unraveling the postwar internationalist order but taking a pause to put it on a more sustainable basis for the future.","Nau, Henry R.",The Trump Doctrine and the Emerging International System,348,8

In contrast to traditional subvisory authorities, modern executives define their style as “digital leaders” much more comprehensively and are thereby essential enabling factors in establishing distance working in companies. Although there is resentment against the creation of jobs in distance working, managers take responsibility for both their employees and companies in many areas. Accordingly, the aim of this article is to raise the concerns and challenges of executives in relation to digital leadership and distance working and, by means of design science from the current “state of the field” scientific literature, combined with an exemplary implementation, a concept to increase the acceptance of distance working to create. The artifact created is evaluated through interviews with ten experts. Technical solutions are seen as crucial basic condition, the culture of trust is lived much more strongly than was known from previous styles. With digital leadership, managers do not feel any loss of control as they trust employees and monitor performance. The communication is expanded to include the off-duty, social component, as managers recognize that leadership can be more trustworthy. In order to continue to position the company well in the market and to be able to act in a future-oriented manner, executives want a strong ally in the legislature who creates the framework in such a way that both the protection of the employee and individual solutions are guaranteed.","Bergsleitner, Florian; Rückel, David",HMD,348,1

Recalibration of R&D‐related policies and incentivisation will require careful consideration, with constructive lessons to be learned from outcomes over the last four decades. This paper presents findings from a new study of stakeholder perceptions as to the National Innovation and Science Agenda's impact on innovation partnerships, and synthesises outcomes from two prior studies. It then examines a newly proposed innovation policy framework, Stimulating Business Investment in Innovation (SBII), set against a background of the shifting mix of paradigms that have comprised Australian innovation policy over the last 40 years. It argues that, following the SBII, any proposed change of policy direction will face significant challenges in its implementation, requiring a fully committed and comprehensive embrace by Government of the new APS engagement framework and greater levels of deliberative democracy.","George, AJ; Tarr, Julie‐Anne",,348,1

Host alterations during leishmaniasis is a feebly touched area that needs to be explored more to better understand the VL prognosis and diagnosis, which are vital to reduce mortality and post-infection sequelae. To address this, we performed untargeted metabolomics of Leishmania donovani (Ld) infected, uninfected and treated BALB/c mice’s tissues and biofluids to elucidate the host metabolome changes using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. Univariate and multivariate data treatments provided numerous significant differential hits in several tissues like the brain, liver, spleen and bone marrow. Differential modulations were also observed in serum, urine and fecal samples of Ld-infected mice, which could be further targeted for biomarker and diagnostic validations. Several metabolic pathways were found to be upregulated/downregulated in infected (TCA, glycolysis, fatty acids, purine and pyrimidine, etcetera) and treated (arginine, fumaric acid, orotic acid, choline succinate, etcetera) samples. Results also illustrated several metabolites with different pattern of modulations in control, infected and treated samples as well as in different tissues/biofluids; for e.g. glutamic acid identified in the serum samples of infected mice. Identified metabolites include a range of amino acids, saccharides, energy-related molecules, etcetera. Furthermore, potential biomarkers have been identified in various tissues—arginine and fumaric acid in brain, choline in liver, 9-(10) EpOME in spleen and bone marrow, N-acetyl putrescine in bone marrow, etcetera. Among biofluids, glutamic acid in serum, hydrazine and deoxyribose in urine and 3-Methyl-2-oxo pentanoic acid in feces are some of the potential biomarkers identified. These metabolites could be further looked into for their role in disease complexity or as a prognostic marker. The presented profiling approach allowed us to attain a metabolic portrait of the individual tissue/biofluid modulations during VL in the host and represent a valuable system readout for further studies. Our outcomes provide an improved understanding of perturbations of the host metabolome interface during VL, including identification of many possible potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets.","Das, Sanchita; Saha, Tanaya; Shaha, Chandrima",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,348,1

The key active ingredients are indole alkaloids (IAs) that exert antibacterial, antiviral, and antitumor pharmacological activities and serve as natural dyes. We assembled the S. cusia genome at the chromosome level through combined PacBio circular consensus sequencing (CCS) and Hi-C sequencing data. Hi-C data revealed a draft genome size of 913.74 Mb, with 904.18 Mb contigs anchored into 16 pseudo-chromosomes. Contig N50 and scaffold N50 were 35.59 and 68.44 Mb, respectively. Of the 32,974 predicted protein-coding genes, 96.52% were functionally annotated in public databases. We predicted 675.66 Mb repetitive sequences, 47.08% of sequences were long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons. Moreover, 983 Strobilanthes-specific genes (SSGs) were identified for the first time, accounting for ~2.98% of all protein-coding genes. Further, 245 putative centromeric and 29 putative telomeric fragments were identified. The transcriptome analysis identified 2,975 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) enriched in phenylpropanoid, flavonoid, and triterpenoid biosynthesis. This systematic characterization of key enzyme-coding genes associated with the IA pathway and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor family formed a network from the shikimate pathway to the indole alkaloid synthesis pathway in S. cusia.

Recent advances aimed at improving outcomes and reducing CAP disease burden are summarized. RECENT FINDINGS Emerging data suggests that newer CAP risk stratification indices based on disease severity hold promise in predicting intensive care need. Additional evidence supports a role of procalcitonin and pro-adrenomedullin as biomarkers of disease severity and for guiding antimicrobial therapy. New diagnostic tools have greatly contributed to early diagnosis and better-targeted therapy. There is increasing recognition of the role of coinfections in CAP. In patients with severe disease, therefore, current guidelines advise against monotherapy. Although inclusion of coverage for atypical pathogens in nonsevere CAP has been challenged, evidence suggests that such coverage is beneficial in patients with severe disease. Use of steroids as adjunctive therapy for CAP, however, is associated with complications and prolonged hospitalization. Updated prevention strategies include approval of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) for adults at risk. SUMMARY Despite these developments research aimed at further reducing CAP-related morbidity and mortality is required. Increasing global life expectancy is likely to expand the at-risk population; therefore, research directed at CAP prevention in view of changing demography is essential.","Irfan, Muhammad; Farooqi, Joveria; Hasan, Rumina",Current opinion in pulmonary medicine,348,29

Since the original ACE (Anevrysme de l'aorte abdominale: Chirurgie versus Endoprothese) randomised control trial, studies of French specific population have also contributed significantly to the body of evidence in support of endovascular abdominal aortic repair. METHODS In the ENDURANT France registry, 180 patients were consecutively enrolled from 20 French centres starting in 2012. Investigational sites included public and private practice and differing centre volumes to be as representative of real world French experience as possible. The aim of this study was to present the five year outcomes from this registry. RESULTS Instructions for use (IFU) were respected in 97.8% (176/180) of patients. At five years, the Kaplan-Meier overall survival was 69.9% ± 3.5% and the freedom from aneurysm related death was 97.6% ± 1.2%. The freedom from Type IA endoleaks was 94.5% ± 1.7%, freedom from endoleaks of any type was 70.1 ± 3.4%, and freedom from secondary endovascular procedure 90.4% ± 2.6%. In addition, 61.6% (45/73) of patients exhibited sac shrinkage at five years. CONCLUSION In this five year report of the Endurant France registry, survival, re-intervention, and freedom from endoleak rates were comparable to recent EVAR registries and there was a high sac shrinkage rate. Secondary procedure and aneurysm rupture were lower than those of ACE, the French RCT which included older generation devices. This prospective registry demonstrates favourable five year outcomes of the Endurant stent graft used within IFU.","Becquemin, Jean-Pierre; Haupert, Serge; Issam, Farah; Dubar, Arnaud; Martelloni, Yvan; Jousset, Yann; Sauguet, Antoine",European journal of vascular and endovascular surgery : the official journal of the European Society for Vascular Surgery,348,1

This study re-evaluates the effectiveness of IFN-α2b during the period from March 11 to June 17, 2020. Patients received a combination of oral antivirals (lopinavir/ritonavir and chloroquine) with intramuscular or subcutaneous administration of IFN-α2b. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients discharged from the hospital; the secondary endpoint was the case fatality rate, and several outcomes related to time variables were also evaluated. From March 11 to June 17, 2,295 patients had been confirmed to be severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive in Cuba, 2,165 were treated with Heberon® Alpha R, and 130 received the approved protocol without IFN. The proportion of fully recovered patients was higher in the IFN-treated compared with the non-IFN-treated group. Prior IFN treatment decreases the likelihood of intensive care and increases the survival after severe or critical diseases. Benefits of IFN were significantly supported by time variables analyzed.

Sixteen QTNs influenced multiple traits, of which, six were associated with resistance to both FAW and MW, suggesting a pleiotropic genetic control. Functional prioritization of candidate genes (CGs) located within 10-30 kb of the QTNs revealed 64 putative GWAS-based CGs (GbCGs) showing evidence of involvement in plant defense mechanisms. Only one GbCG was associated with each of the five of the six combined resistance QTNs, thus reinforcing the pleiotropy hypothesis. In addition, through in silico co-functional network inferences, an additional 107 network-based CGs (NbCGs), biologically connected to the 64 GbCGs, and differentially expressed under biotic or abiotic stress, were revealed within MIRGRs.

This representation can be maintained for a certain duration in the absence of previously elicited inputs. The reliance on an internal representation rather than purely on the basis of external stimuli is a hallmark feature of higher-order functions such as working memory. Patterns of neural activity produced in response to sensory inputs can continue long after the disappearance of previous inputs. Experimental and theoretical studies have largely invested in understanding how animals faithfully maintain sensory representations during ongoing reverberations of neural activity. However, these studies have focused on preassigned protocols of stimulus presentation, leaving out by default the possibility of exploring how the content of working memory interacts with ongoing input streams. Here, we study working memory using a network of spiking neurons with dynamic synapses subject to short-term and long-term synaptic plasticity. The formal model is embodied in a physical robot as a companion approach under which neuronal activity is directly linked to motor output. The artificial agent is used as a methodological tool for studying the formation of working memory capacity. To this end, we devise a keyboard listening framework to delineate the context under which working memory content is (1) refined, (2) overwritten or (3) resisted by ongoing new input streams. Ultimately, this study takes a neurorobotic perspective to resurface the long-standing implication of working memory in flexible cognition.","Berberian, Nareg; Ross, Matt; Chartier, Sylvain",PloS one,348,7

Here, we show that the actin-related protein (Arp) 2/3 complex, a key factor in actin filament branching and polymerization, is involved in the shuttling of aquaporin-2 (AQP2) between the trans Golgi network (TGN) and the plasma membrane. Arp2/3 inhibition (using CK-666) or siRNA knockdown blocks vasopressin induced AQP2 membrane accumulation, and induces the formation of distinct AQP2 perinuclear patches positive for markers of TGN-derived clathrin coated vesicles. After a 20oC cold block, AQP2 formed perinuclear patches due continuous endocytosis coupled with inhibition of exit from the TGN-associated vesicles. Upon rewarming, AQP2 normally leaves the TGN, and redistributes into the cytoplasm, entering the exocytotic pathway. Inhibition of Arp2/3 blocked this process, and trapped AQP2 in clathrin positive vesicles. Taken together, these results suggest that Arp2/3 is essential for AQP2 trafficking, specifically for its delivery into the post-TGN exocytotic pathway to the plasma membrane.","Liu, Chen-Chung Steven; Cheung, Pui W; Dinesh, Anupama; Baylor, Noah; Paunescu, Theodor C; Nair, Anil V; Bouley, Richard; Brown, Dennis",American journal of physiology.

All patients undergoing liver resection at a tertiary referral centre between January 2009 and April 2019 were identified. Primary outcome was the length of stay (LOS), secondary outcomes were functional recovery, complications and readmission rates. Patients in the ERP with different protocols for open, laparoscopic, major and minor resections were compared to a historical cohort. Of 1056 patients, 644 were treated within the ERP. A comparable duration of hospital stay [7 days (IQR (interquartile range) 6-12) vs 7 days (IQR 5-9) p = 0.047] and faster functional recovery with fewer complications was found in the ERP group [94 (50.5%) vs 103 (35.9%) p < 0.002]. Those advantages were smaller after open minor compared to open major resection. In patients undergoing laparoscopic resection no differences were observed except for a lower readmission rate [21 (9.3%) vs 13 (3.6%) p = 0.005].

Recently, some authors have used a single-port transvesical approach to excise the distal ureter and bladder cuff following LNU. The aim of the study was to present our initial experience in ""en bloc"" dissection of the distal ureter and bladder cuff during LNU, using a transvesical single-port approach (T-LESS) and standard laparoscopic instruments. From April to October 2012, 5 patients aged 45 to 73 years with upper urinary tract urothelial tumors were subjected to LNU/T-LESS. After a standard LNU was performed, a TriPort+(®) device was introduced into the bladder and the pneumovesicum was established. A bladder cuff with a distal ureter was dissected and put in the paravesical tissue. The bladder wall defect was closed with the V-loc(®) 3/0 suture. The LNU was then completed in the flank position. All procedures were completed successfully. No significant blood loss or complications were observed. The mean operative time was 250 min (range: 200-370) for a total procedure and 59 min (range: 42-80) for the T-LESS stage. The postoperative hospital stay was 5.2 days (range: 4-9). Pathologic examination revealed no positive margin in any of the cases. The LNU/T-LESS approach is an efficient and safe procedure. A well-visualized dissection of the distal ureter, closing the defect of the bladder, the use of standard laparoscopic instruments and a good cosmesis are advantages of the method.","Roslan, Marek; Markuszewski, Marcin; Kłącz, Jakub; Sieczkowski, Marcin; Połom, Wojciech; Piaskowski, Wojciech; Krajka, Kazimierz; Matuszewski, Marcin",Wideochirurgia i inne techniki maloinwazyjne = Videosurgery and other miniinvasive techniques,348,33

Although international guidelines on menopause recommend the use of postmenopausal hormone therapy with or without selective estrogen receptor modulators for control of vasomotor symptoms, the effects of these treatments on kidney function and albuminuria are unclear. Furthermore, women with chronic kidney disease are at significantly increased risk of venous thromboembolism and malignancy, well-documented adverse effects of postmenopausal hormone therapy. Our study aims to establish the effect of these treatments on kidney function and albuminuria in women, as well as determine the safety of these treatments in the chronic kidney disease population. METHODS We will conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis addressing the effect and safety of postmenopausal hormone therapy and selective estrogen receptor modulators on kidney outcomes in women. We plan to search for published (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), tables of contents of relevant journals) and unpublished (ongoing studies, conference proceedings) studies in all languages examining the effect of postmenopausal hormone therapy, including selective estrogen receptor modulators, on kidney function and albuminuria, as well as the risk of adverse outcomes of these treatments in women with chronic kidney disease. Two independent investigators will screen identified abstracts and select studies that examine the effect of postmenopausal hormone therapy and selective estrogen receptor modulators on kidney outcomes in the general population or adverse outcomes in the chronic kidney disease population. Data on study population, intervention, outcomes, as well as study quality and risk of bias will be independently extracted from each eligible study. Along with descriptive presentation of data, outcome measures will be presented as meta-analyses using a random effects model. Planned subgroup analyses will be completed, and meta-regression will be performed if significant heterogeneity is noted. DISCUSSION By examining the effects of postmenopausal hormone therapy and selective estrogen receptor modulators on kidney function and albuminuria, the results of this systematic review and meta-analysis will inform management of postmenopausal women in the general population. Furthermore, it will evaluate the safety, including the risks of known adverse outcomes of postmenopausal hormone therapy and selective estrogen receptor modulators, in the already vulnerable chronic kidney disease population.

In many applications, a sequence family classified into several subfamilies is given and each subfamily is modeled separately by one pHMM. A major drawback of this approach is the difficulty of coping with subfamilies composed of very few sequences.Correct subtyping of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) sequences is one of the most crucial bioinformatic tasks affected by this problem of small subfamilies, i.e., HIV-1 subtypes with a small number of known sequences. To deal with small samples for particular subfamilies of HIV-1, we employ a machine learning approach. More precisely, we make use of an existing HMM architecture and its associated inference engine, while replacing the unsupervised estimation of emission probabilities by a supervised method. For that purpose, we use regularized linear discriminant learning together with a balancing scheme to account for the widely varying sample size. After training the multiclass linear discriminants, the corresponding weights are transformed to valid probabilities using a softmax function.We apply this modified algorithm to classify HIV-1 sequence data (in the form of partial-length HIV-1 sequences and semi-artificial recombinants) and show that the performance of pHMMs can be significantly improved by the proposed technique.","Bulla, Ingo; Schultz, Anne-Kathrin; Meinicke, Peter",Statistical applications in genetics and molecular biology,348,24

METHODS This is a single institution retrospective chart review of patients 65 years and older with an initial hospital visit (V1) for symptomatic gallstone disease, over a 4-year period. Patients with initial ""non-operative"" management were defined as those without surgery at V1 and without elective surgery at visit 2 (V2). Baseline characteristics included age, sex, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), diagnosis, and interventions (ERCP or cholecystostomy) at V1. Outcomes assessed over 1 year were as follows: recurrence (any ER/admission visit following V1), surgery, complications, and mortality. A survival analysis using a Cox proportional hazards model was performed to assess predictors of recurrence. RESULTS There were 195 patients initially treated non-operatively at V1. Mean age was 78.3 ± 7.8 years, 45.6% were male, and the mean CCI was 2.1 ± 1.9. At V1, 54.4% had a diagnosis of biliary colic or cholecystitis, while 45.6% had a diagnosis of cholangitis, pancreatitis, or choledocholithiasis. 39.5% underwent ERCP or cholecystostomy. Excluding 10 patients who died at V1, 31.3% of patients had a recurrence over the study period. Among these, 43.5% had emergency surgery, 34.8% had complications, and 4.3% died. Median time to first recurrence was 2 months (range 6 days-4.8 months). Intervention at V1 was associated with a lower probability of recurrence (HR 0.3, CI [0.14-0.65]). CONCLUSION One-third of elderly patients will develop a recurrence following non-operative management of symptomatic biliary disease. These recurrences are associated with significant rates of emergency surgery and morbidity. Percutaneous or endoscopic therapies may decrease the risk of recurrence.","Bergman, Simon; Al-Bader, Mohammed; Sourial, Nadia; Vedel, Isabelle; Hanna, Wael C; Bilek, Aaron J; Galatas, Christos; Marek, Jonah E; Fraser, Shannon A",Surgical endoscopy,348,1

METHODS A total of 1004 patients with panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, or posttraumatic stress disorder were randomized to CALM or usual care. Outcomes at 6, 12, and 18 months were compared in patients with and without moderate pain interference (for the entire anxiety disorder group and then just those with comorbid major depression) and in patients taking and not taking opioid medication (entire group, just those with comorbid major depression, and just those with moderate pain interference). RESULTS Patients with pain interference and patients taking opioid pain medication were more anxious [Brief Symptom Inventory anxiety subscale] and disabled (Sheehan Disability) at baseline, improved over time at similar rates, but at 18 months had lower response and remission rates. There was no moderating effect on the intervention. In patients with comorbid major depression, patients using opioid medications showed a trend for less disability improvement over time, and in patients with pain, patients using opioids showed less sustained anxiety response at 18 months. CONCLUSIONS Anxious patients with pain benefit as much as those without pain from cognitive-behavioral therapy and medication treatment. Among patients with pain, however, there is some evidence of a reduced anxiety treatment response in those taking opioid medication, which should be further studied.","Roy-Byrne, Peter; Sullivan, Mark D; Sherbourne, Cathy D; Golinelli, Daniela; Craske, Michelle G; Sullivan, Greer; Stein, Murray B",The Clinical journal of pain,348,16

The mTOR inhibitor sirolimus was used in selected liver graft recipients despite safety concerns and lack of approval. Everolimus is another mTOR inhibitor approved after liver transplantation. It is currently unknown, whether conversion of sirolimus to everolimus is safe in long-term liver graft recipients. Long-term liver graft recipients treated with sirolimus were converted to everolimus. A systematical analysis of biochemical and clinical data before and after conversion was performed. Sixteen patients were included (female/male, 8/8). Median (range) age at conversion was 66 years (49-78 years), and patients were converted at a median (range) of 10.1 years (4.0-22.3 years) after liver transplantation. In the majority of patients, no dose adjustment was needed after conversion. No rejection and no cytomegalovirus replication episodes were observed. Furthermore, no differences were found with respect to kidney function, diabetes mellitus, or blood pressure before and after conversion. Bilirubin serum concentration was lower, whereas aspartate aminotransaminase, alanine aminotransferase, and triglycerides serum concentrations were higher after conversion to everolimus. Neither clinical- nor graft-associated significant complications were observed after conversion from sirolimus to everolimus in long-term liver graft recipients.

METHODS Among people who participated in a community cohort study between 2013 and 2018 with previous depression measurement, a total of 1928 people without quarantine experience (680 men and 1249 women) were included after responding to an online survey in March 2020. In the 2020 survey, people were queried about daily needs supply, social support, risk perception, change during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as mental health indices measuring loneliness, anxiety symptoms, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and depression. Separate analyses by gender were conducted to assess the association between COVID-19-related experiences and each mental health index, using multivariable logistic regressions with additional adjustment and stratification with pre-existing depression status. RESULTS We could not observe significant gender differences for depression, anxiety, PTSD, and loneliness at 55 days after the start of the COVID-19 outbreak. Most external support, including daily needs supply and social support, protected men and women from experiencing severe anxiety (for life supply, OR = 0.92 (95%CI 0.88-0.97) (men) and OR = 0.95 (95% CI 0.91-0.99) (women); for social support, OR = 0.92(both for men and women, p < 0.01)). The results were similar for depression and PTSD. External support showed a larger reduction in the likelihoods for anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic among people with pre-existing depression compared to previously healthy people, and it was more prominent in men. CONCLUSION COVID-19 significantly affected the mental health of both men and women in the early period of the pandemic. Having enough supply of daily needs and social support seems important, especially for people with previous depression.","Jung, Sun Jae; Jeon, Ye Jin; Yang, Ji Su; Park, Minseo; Kim, Kwanghyun; Chibnik, Lori B; Kim, Hyeon Chang; Koenen, Karestan C",Journal of psychosomatic research,348,1

Proper opening of the blood-brain barrier is crucial for the treatment, yet there are no means available for its real-time monitoring. The intact blood-brain barrier maintains a mV-level electrical potential difference between blood and brain tissue, giving rise to a measurable electrical signal at the scalp. Therefore, we used direct-current electroencephalography (DC-EEG) to characterize the spatiotemporal behavior of scalp-recorded slow electrical signals during blood-brain barrier opening. Nine anesthetized patients receiving chemotherapy were monitored continuously during 47 blood-brain barrier openings induced by carotid or vertebral artery mannitol infusion. Left or right carotid artery mannitol infusion generated a strongly lateralized DC-EEG response that began with a 2 min negative shift of up to 2000 μV followed by a positive shift lasting up to 20 min above the infused carotid artery territory, whereas contralateral responses were of opposite polarity. Vertebral artery mannitol infusion gave rise to a minimally lateralized and more uniformly distributed slow negative response with a posterior-frontal gradient. Simultaneously performed near-infrared spectroscopy detected a multiphasic response beginning with mannitol-bolus induced dilution of blood and ending in a prolonged increase in the oxy/deoxyhemoglobin ratio. The pronounced DC-EEG shifts are readily accounted for by opening and sealing of the blood-brain barrier. These data show that DC-EEG is a promising real-time monitoring tool for blood-brain barrier disruption augmented drug delivery.","Kiviniemi, Vesa; Korhonen, Vesa; Kortelainen, Jukka; Rytky, Seppo; Keinänen, Tuija; Tuovinen, Timo; Isokangas, Matti; Sonkajärvi, Eila; Siniluoto, Topi; Nikkinen, Juha; Alahuhta, Seppo; Tervonen, Osmo; Turpeenniemi-Hujanen, Taina; Myllylä, Teemu; Kuittinen, Outi; Voipio, Juha",PloS one,348,25

We explored the association between novel clot characteristics on baseline CTA and early reperfusion with IV tPA in patients with acute ischemic stroke by using classification and regression tree analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS Data are from patients with acute ischemic stroke and proximal anterior circulation occlusions from the Calgary CTA data base (2003-2012) and the Keimyung Stroke Registry (2005-2009). Patients receiving IV tPA followed by intra-arterial therapy were included. Clot location, length, residual flow within the clot, ratio of contrast Hounsfield units pre- and postclot, and the M1 segment origin to the proximal clot interface distance were assessed on baseline CTA. Early reperfusion (TICI 2a and above) with IV tPA was assessed on the first angiogram. RESULTS Two hundred twenty-eight patients (50.4% men; median age, 69 years; median baseline NIHSS score, 17) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Median symptom onset to IV tPA time was 120 minutes (interquartile range = 70 minutes); median IV tPA to first angiography time was 70.5 minutes (interquartile range = 62 minutes). Patients with residual flow within the clot were 5 times more likely to reperfuse than those without it. Patients with residual flow and a shorter clot length (≤15 mm) were most likely to reperfuse (70.6%). Patients with clots in the M1 MCA without residual flow reperfused more if clots were distal and had a clot interface ratio in Hounsfield units of <2 (36.8%). Patients with proximal M1 clots without residual flow reperfused 8% of the time. Carotid-T/-L occlusions rarely reperfused (1.7%). Interrater reliability for these clot characteristics was good.

Even after a major outbreak, the emergence of drug-resistant influenza viruses can pose disease control problems. Here we report a novel 6E3 monoclonal antibody capable of recognizing and binding to the H275Y neuraminidase (NA) mutation, which has been associated with reduced susceptibility of influenza viruses to NA inhibitors. The 6E3 antibody had a KD of 72.74 μM for wild-type NA and 32.76 pM for H275Y NA, suggesting that it can identify drug-resistant pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) influenza virus. Molecular modeling studies also suggest the high-affinity binding of this antibody to pH1N1 H275Y NA. This antibody was also subject to dot-blot, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, bare-eye detection, and lateral flow assay to demonstrate its specificity to drug-resistant pH1N1. Furthermore, it was immobilized on Au nanoplate and nanoparticles, enabling surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)-based detection of the H275Y mutant pH1N1. Using 6E3 antibody-mediated SERS immunoassay, the drug-resistant influenza virus can be detected at a low concentration of 102 plaque-forming units/mL. We also detected pH1N1 in human nasopharyngeal aspirate samples, suggesting that the 6E3-mediated SERS assay has the potential for diagnostic application.

Mice lacking St18 in myeloid lineages exhibit increased retinal vasculature with enhanced serum VEGF-A concentrations. Despite the normal activation of NF-κB target genes, these mice are highly susceptible to LPS-induced shock, polymicrobial sepsis, and experimental colitis, accompanied by enhanced vascular and intestinal leakage. Pharmacological inhibition of VEGF signaling rescued the high mortality rate of myeloid-specific St18-deficient mice in response to inflammation. Mechanistically, St18 directly binds to Sp1 and attenuates its activity, leading to the suppression of Sp1 target gene VEGF-A. Using mouse genetic and pharmacological models, we reveal myeloid St18 as a critical septic death protector.","Maruyama, Kenta; Kidoya, Hiroyasu; Takemura, Naoki; Sugisawa, Erika; Takeuchi, Osamu; Kondo, Takeshi; Eid, Mohammed Mansour Abbas; Tanaka, Hiroki; Martino, Mikaël M; Takakura, Nobuyuki; Takayama, Yasunori; Akira, Shizuo; Vandenbon, Alexis; Kumagai, Yutaro",Cell reports,348,16

DATA AND METHODS this study used a SIRD model in which the infection reproduction number R0 varied over time, according to a piecewise constant function. The fatality parameter and the time from contagion to infection resolution (death or recovery) were fixed to ensure parameter identifiability, and the model was calibrated on the Covid-19 deaths notified from March 9th to June 30th 2020. The uncertainty around the estimates was quantified through parametric bootstrap. Finally, the resulting model was used to produce medium-long term projections of the epidemic dynamics. RESULTS the date of the first infection in Tuscany was estimated as February 21st 2020. The value of R0(t) ranged from 7.78 (95%CI 7.55-7.89), at the beginning of the outbreak, to a value very close to 0 between April 27th and May 17th. Finally, R0(t) rose, reaching an average of 0.66 (0.32, 0.88) between May 18th and June 30th. At the epidemic peak, estimated at the beginning of April, the notified infected people circulating in the region were just 22% of those predicted by the model. According to the estimated SIRD, under the hypothetical scenario that R0(t) slightly exceeds 1 from the beginning of October 2020, a new wave of contagion could arise by next spring. CONCLUSIONS the estimated trend of R0(t) is suggestive of a strong effect of the lockdown in Tuscany and of a mild increase of the contagion potentially attributable to the easing of the containment measures. Medium-long term projections unequivocally indicate that the danger of a new epidemic wave has not been averted.","Cereda, Giulia; Viscardi, Cecilia; Gottard, Anna; Mealli, Fabrizia; Baccini, Michela",Epidemiologia e prevenzione,348,16

Furthermore, there is no report about which vessel access, either jugular or iliac vein, is superior for elderly patients requiring TCCs. METHODS In the present study, we reviewed the clinical parameters of 127 patients aged over 65 years with 207 new TCC placements and measured the incidence of catheter patency, infection, dysfunction, and survival of TCCs. RESULTS We found that the average primary catheter patency was substantially shorter in iliac vein TCCs than in internal jugular vein TCCs (373 vs. 641 catheter-days). Patients with iliac vein TCCs underwent more frequent exchanges than those with internal jugular vein TCCs. Infection-free survival was similar for both groups (p = 0.748), but dysfunction-free survival was significantly poorer in iliac vein TCC group than that in internal jugular vein TCC group (p = 0.001). Age and previous catheter placement were the independent risk factors for TCCs survival. CONCLUSION Taken together, our results suggested that iliac vein TCCs present an increased risk of dysfunction compared to internal jugular vein TCCs in elderly hemodialysis patients.","Wang, Lihua; Wei, Fang; Jiang, Aili; Chen, Haiyan; Sun, Guijiang; Bi, Xueqing",International urology and nephrology,348,17

Purpose of this analysis was a systematic assessment of underlying reasons for reperfusion failures. MATERIALS AND METHODS An intention-to-treat single-center cohort (n = 592) was re-evaluated for all patients in whom no reperfusion could be achieved (n = 63). Baseline characteristics of patients were compared between patients with and without reperfusion failures. After qualitative review of all cases with reperfusion failures, a classification system was proposed and relative frequencies were reported. In a second step, occurrence of delayed recanalization at 24 hours after reperfusion failure and dependency on IV-tPA were evaluated. RESULTS In 63/592 patients with an intention to perform stent-retriever thrombectomy, no reperfusion was achieved (TICI 0/1, 10.6%, 95% CI, 8.2%-13.1%). Older patients (adjusted OR per yr = 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.05) and patients with M2 occlusion (adjusted OR = 3.36; 95% CI, 1.82-6.21) were at higher risk for reperfusion failure. In most cases, no reperfusion was a consequence of technical difficulties (56/63, 88.9%). In one-third of these cases, reperfusion failures were due to the inability to reach the target occlusion (20/63, 31.7%), while ""stent-retriever failure"" occurred in 39.7% (25/63) of patients. Delayed recanalization was very rare (18.2%), without dependence on IV-tPA pretreatment status. CONCLUSIONS Reasons for reperfusion failure in stent-retriever thrombectomy are heterogeneous. The failure to establish intracranial or cervical access is almost as common as stent-retriever failure after establishing intracranial access. Systematic reporting standards of reasons may help to further estimate relative frequencies and thereby guide priorities for technical development and scientific effort.","Kaesmacher, J; Gralla, J; Mosimann, P J; Zibold, F; Heldner, M R; Piechowiak, E; Dobrocky, T; Arnold, M; Fischer, U; Mordasini, P",AJNR.

By applying an unbiased transcriptomics-based approach, we have identified Pf77 and male development gene 1 (PfMDV-1) as two P. falciparum TBV antigens that, upon immunization, induced antibodies that caused reductions in oocyst counts in Anopheles mosquito midguts in a standard membrane feeding assay. In-depth studies were performed to characterize the genetic diversity of, stage-specific expression by, and natural immunity to these two molecules to evaluate their suitability as TBV candidates. Pf77 and PfMDV-1 display limited antigenic polymorphism, are pan-developmentally expressed within the parasite, and induce naturally occurring antibodies in Ghanaian adults, which raises the prospect of natural boosting of vaccine-induced immune response in endemic regions. Together, these biological properties suggest that Pf77 and PfMDV-1 may warrant further investigation as TBV candidates.","Tripathi, Abhai K; Oakley, Miranda S; Verma, Nitin; Mlambo, Godfree; Zheng, Hong; Meredith, Scott M; Essuman, Edward; Puri, Ankit; Skelton, Richard A; Takeda, Kazuyo; Majam, Victoria; Quakyi, Isabella A; Locke, Emily; Morin, Merribeth; Miura, Kazutoyo; Long, Carole A; Kumar, Sanjai",Science translational medicine,348,25

Our study aim was to explore mouthwash (MW) as an alternative diagnostic method, in light of the disadvantages of ONP swabs. Methods Covid-19 outpatients molecular confirmed by ONP swab were repeatedly examined with ONP swab and MW with normal saline (0.9%). Other types of fluids were compared to normal saline. The Cq values obtained with each method were compared. Results Among 137 pairs of ONP swabs and MW samples, 84.6% (116/137) of ONP swabs were positive by at least one of the genes (N, E, R). However MW detected 70.8% (97/137) of samples as positive, which means 83.6% (97/116) out of positive ONP swabs, missing mainly Cq value>30. In both methods, the N gene was the most sensitive one. Therefore MW samples targeting N gene, which was positive in 95/137 (69.3%), is comparable to ONP-swabs targeting E and R genes which gave equal results; 95/137 (69.3%) and 90/137 (65.7%) respectively. Comparing saline MW to distilled water gave equal results, while commercial mouth-rinsing solutions were less sensitive. Conclusions MW with normal saline, especially when tested by N gene, can effectively detect COVID 19 patients. Furthermore, this method was not inferior when compared to R and E genes of ONP swabs, which are common targets in many laboratories around the world.","Biber, A.; Lev, D.; Mandelboim, M.; Lustig, Y.; Harmelin, G.; Shaham, A.; Erster, O.; Schwartz, E.",,348,16

The availability of digitised clinical data can also turn organisations and their networks into Learning Healthcare Systems (LHSs) if used across all levels of health and care. This review explores the impact of digital systems on AKI patient care to gauge progress towards establishing LHSs and to identify existing gaps in the research. Method Embase, PubMed, Medline, Cochrane, Scopus and Web of Science databases were searched. Studies of real-time or near real-time digital AKI management systems which reported process and outcome measures were included. Results Thematic analysis of 43 studies showed that most interventions used real-time SCr levels to trigger responses to enable risk prediction, early recognition of AKI or harm prevention by individual clinicians (micro level) or specialist teams (meso level). Interventions at system (macro level) were rare. There was limited evidence of change in outcomes. Conclusion Whilst the benefits of real time digital clinical data at micro level for AKI management have been evident for some time, their application at meso and macro levels is emergent therefore limiting progress towards establishing LHSs. Lack of progress is due to digital maturity, system design, human factors and policy levers. Future approaches need to harness the potential of interoperability and data analytic advances and include multiple stakeholder perspectives to overcome these factors.","Chew, C. K.

Dentists performing procedures in the patient’s respiratory tract, creating an aerosol, constitute a group of high risk of infection. Over the years, the universal way of cross-matching has changed. Objective: The aim of the study is to review the current literature and present the impact of the pandemic on dental practices, and the introduced new solutions to existing procedures to prevent infections among workers and patients. State of knowledge: Dental office workers are exposed to a virus with a high potential for spreading among the population. Most of the infected patients (80%) are asymptomatic, therefore each patient should be treated as a potential carrier of SARS-COV-2. Practice rooms should be adapted by removing unnecessary items, such as newspapers and brochures. Providing a higher level of personal protective equipment, minimum FFP, and covering the body surface create a physical barrier against this pathogen. It is recommended to use manual intruments instead of mechanical ones which generate aerosol during dental procedures. Non-contact channels of communication with the patient (teledentistry) eliminate the risk of infection and should be used in the initial patient assessment and medical advice that does not require a personal visit. Conclusions: In the face of the pandemic caused by the SARS-COV-2 virus, it is the duty of dentists to properly prepare their offices, provide personal protective equipment to medical staff and patients, and adapt medical procedures to combat the epidemic situation. Dentists should also use teledentistry, which, with certain limitations, allows them to help patients without the risk of transmitting the virus.","Wójcicka, Agnieszka",Medycyna Środowiskowa = Environmental Medicine,348,1

Due to the limitation of the privacy protection of medical big data, releasing the data of patients is not allowed. However, as COVID-19 spreads globally, it is urgent to develop a robust diagnostic model to serve as many institutions as possible. Therefore, we propose a 5G-enabled architecture of auxiliary diagnosis based on federated learning for multiple institutions and central cloud collaboration to realize the sharing of diagnosis models with high generalization performance. In order to exchange model and parameters between the central and distributed nodes, a framework of diagnosis model cognition is constructed for sharing and updating the model adaptively. The severity classification experiments of COVID-19 were carried out on the central cloud and three edge cloud servers to verify the effectiveness of the proposed architecture and model cognition strategy. At the same time, the aggregated model shows good performance with accuracy rates of 95.3, 79.4, and 97.7 percent on distributed nodes, and the recognition results can assist doctors in executing auxiliary diagnosis. Finally, the open issues of model fusion of multimodal data in the 5G network architecture are discussed.","Wang, R.; Xu, J. F.; Ma, Y. J.; Talha, M.; Al-Rakhami, M.

The concomitant presence of co morbidities like chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes, chronic heart disease etc. makes the task of patient management difficult. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES To assess the patterns of liver test abnormalities in patients of COVID 19 infection with and without CKD and evaluate the probable outcomes. MATERIALs and METHODS A cross-sectional retrospective observational study done on 600 patient samples (Group 1 COVID-19 without CKD, Group 2 COVID-19 with CKD and Group 3 non COVID-19 with CKD) which were processed for Liver function test (AST, ALT and ALP) and Renal function test (Urea and Creatinine) in the Department of Biochemistry, Dr. RML Hospital New Delhi. RESULTS AST and ALT levels were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in all COVID 19 positive patients group 1 mean and 2 SD, (63.63 and 42.89 U/L & 50.25 and 46.53 U/L respectively) and group 2 (90.59 and 62.51 U/L & 72.09 and 67.24 U/L respectively) as compared to Group 3 (25.24 and 7.47 U/L & 24.93 and 11.44 U/L respectively) and also a statistically significant elevation is seen in these two parameters (AST & ALT) in Group 2 as compared to Group 1 (P < 0.05). There was a negative significant correlation between eGFR and AST/ALT levels in Group 1 (p < 0.05). In Group 2, a weak positive correlation was seen with ALT (p < 0.01). No significant correlation existed between eGFR and ALP in groups 1 and 2. In Group 3, eGFR showed strong correlations with AST and ALT levels (p < 0.01) and reduction in kidney function correlated well with increase in serum ALP levels, (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS This study most comprehensively describes that SARS-CoV-2 positive CKD patients show more elevations in serum aminotransferase levels as compared to their non-CKD counterparts, in contrast to non-COVID-19 CKD cases. Serum ALT values in SARS-CoV-2 patients show significant correlation with calculated eGFR values. Elevated ALP values in CKD patients may be used as an indicator of declining kidney function. However, more studies in this direction are needed.","Kumar, R.; Jana, P.; Priyadarshini, I.; ROY, S.; Dutta, P.; Das, S.",,348,16

With an increase in age, the need for medical support also grows, which may lead to unplanned and frequent visits to the doctor. Recent developments in Smart technologies and the Internet of Things (IoT) will play an important role in designing suitable home healthcare support services for older adults and enable self-care for people as they age at home. The current COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the push for telehealth technology solutions including remote patient monitoring for senior adults who are medically or socially vulnerable. Remote health services are being promoted as a means of preserving the patient-healthcare provider relationship at times when an in-person visit is not practical or feasible, especially during COVID-19 and beyond. Smart technologies and IoT could potentially improve health outcomes and save lives. This paper will explore issues and challenges in introducing smart technologies and IoT into the homes of older adults, as well as explore features of the technology and potential outcomes that could allow older adults to remain autonomous, independent, safe, and encourage aging in place.

This impact was so severe that on April 8, 2020, a proposal to update the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings Inc. (CME) trading rule to permit negative prices was applied to CME’s WTI Oil futures contracts;this led to a novel phenomenon in which the closing clearing price of WTI Oil May future was $-37.63/barrel based on fewer than 400 contracts’ trading volume in the last three minutes, reflecting less than 0.2% of the total trading contracts volume on April 20, 2020. This occurrence of negative closing clearing price for CME’s WTI Oil futures trading, cannot be explained simply by just the principle of supply and demand;instead, it highlights vulnerabilities caused by CME’s allowance of negative price trading (based on its trading platform), a decision which brings potential and fundamental challenges to the global financial system. This event challenges not just our basic concepts of “value” and trading “price” of commodities and goods that underline our understanding of the framework for the invisible hand and general equilibrium theory in economics established by a few generations of scholars since Adam Smith in 1776 for market economies, but also have wider implications on the fundamentals that underpin our ideas of value and labor in the organization, activity, and behavior of civilizations and individual liberties.

People aged 50 or older have a death rate of 30 to 220 times that of the 18 to 29 age group.Each country strives to lower the infection rate by quickly providing the public infectious disease information through emergency alert messages. However, existing emergency alerts messaging systems provide redundant precautions. Also, the National Emergency Alert (NEA) messages are sent through the base transceiver station, the area where the actual COVID-19 confirmed case occurred and the area where the message was received do not match. In this paper, we present CO-ALERT, a tool that effectively provides older adults aged 50 or older with NEA messages. We developed CO-ALERT through a design thinking process to suggest solutions that effectively address the needs of potential target users. User-friendly interfaces of CO-ALERT enable older adults to view NEA messages based on their preferences.

As an IoT-enabled paradigm, mobile crowdsensing (MCS) can offer more possibilities for data collection to support various IoT applications and services. As an extension, MCS can be used for data gathering amid COVID-19 pandemic crisis. Bridging Artificial Intelligence and IoT can achieve not only maintaining low infection rates of COVID-19 but can also facilitate an effective rapid testing strategy to reduce community spread. In this research, an intelligent strategy to deploy autonomous vehicle-based mobile testing facilities is proposed to enable early detection of infected cases based upon MCS data acquired through smart devices via wireless communications such as Wifi, LTE and 5G. To this end, a Self Organizing Feature Map is designed to manage MCS-based data for planning of the autonomous mobile assessment centers. Pre-identified zero-day locations and worst-case scenario are considered to determine the best combination for MCS participation rate and budget limitations. Numerical results demonstrate that once 30% of MCS participants are recruited, it becomes possible to cover the pre-identified zero-day locations and enable detection of infected cases under the worst case scenario to determine the AV routes more efficiently than other options for a certain number of neurons in SOFM. The worst-case scenario demonstrates that 30% participant rate ensures detection of infected cases in 27 days for 81 stops even infected cases are outside of the autonomous vehicle testing coverage. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Simsek, M.; Boukerche, A.; Kantarci, B.; Khan, S.",Pervasive and Mobile Computing,348,1

Adherence to control measures by the population is influenced by their knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) toward COVID-19. Objective: The objective of this study was to determine KAP toward COVID-19 among the general public of Manipur. Methods: A semi-structured questionnaire was used to interview the study participants. The demographics and KAP of the participants were investigated. Chi-square test and t-test were used for statistical analysis. Results: Out of the total participants (n = 398), 240 (60.3%) were female. One hundred and seventeen (29.4%) participants have adequate knowledge regarding COVID-19. The number of participants who have adequate knowledge was significantly more among males, those residing in plain districts, those residing in rural areas, and among those who studied up to graduate and above. The study also showed that attitude toward practicing more hand hygiene during infectious disease outbreaks was significantly associated with residence, education, religion, and occupation. A significant association was also observed between the preventive practices and knowledge, gender, district, residence, and education. Conclusion: Nearly one-third of the participants have good knowledge and positive attitude. However, when coming to practice, a little more than one-tenth of the study participants practiced preventive behaviors all the time. Knowledge on COVID-19 and practice of preventive behaviors were significantly associated with gender, district, residence, education, and occupation. The results of this study can help to identify the specific target groups with low KAP with well-planned, tailored strategies. © 2021 Journal of Medical Society ;Published by Wolters Kluwer-Medknow.","Konjengbam, S.; Phurailatpam, M.

In particular, research has identified cultural tightness, characterized by strict social norms and punishments, as one key adaptation that helps groups coordinate to survive collective threats. However, interferences with threat signals that facilitate tightening can lead to cultural mismatches?either too much or not enough tightening. I discuss two examples of cultural mismatches: the COVID-19 pandemic (a case in which collective threat is real, but there is a resistance to tightening) and the rise of populist movements (a case in which exaggerated threat leads to unnecessary tightening).","Gelfand, Michele J.",Current Directions in Psychological Science,348,16

These advanced technologies are not only being applied widely to pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturing processes but are also helping the doctors and nurses in identifying and diagnosing the COVID patients. In the era of science and technology, people have realized the importance of robotics and automation and are using these technologies exclusively in field of education, grocery stores, restaurants and food delivery outlets etc. to maintain the norm of social distancing. Due to rapid increase in the number of epidemics and now this corona pandemic, demand for robotics and automation has increased manifold in healthcare, medical and pharmaceutical sectors due to shortage of medical staff and equipments and fear of spreading the disease from one person to another. Moreover, robots can also be used by the manufacturing industries to revive their production and to reduce the impact of present and future epidemic challenges. Although the use of robots and automation is not new, but people still have certain apprehensions of using these technologies on large scale. Some of the problems associated with robotics and automation are lack of funding, high initial cost, reduction in job, adaptability, lack of human interaction, regular updation, cyber virus threats etc. To deal with coronavirus robots and automation are being used in different forms and types such as telerobots for interaction and communication with patients, medical robots for disinfection purpose, drones and patrol robots for public safety, robot vans for delivering food and other essential items, 3D printing for manufacturing medical equipments etc. We cannot predict how long this coronavirus will last, but these cutting-edge technologies can be used for the revival of industrial production, and it’s high time for manufacturing industries to upgrade their production and assembly lines with automation tools and digital technologies for safe and continuous operations. These technologies can be used with aim to decrease the workload of existing workforce and not to replacing them. Existing robots can be repurposed to save time and money and there is no need for stockpile the robots which can make them outdated. It is very well known that resources cannot be developed in one day. It takes number of years to build them so that they can be used in case of emergency. So, it is high time that governments and agencies all over the world should come up with a proper plan to integrate robotic and automation with the existing workforce for the fight against the next pandemic and enhancing the efficiency. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Chauhan, A.","Studies in Systems, Decision and Control",348,1

The mouse disease is primarily immune-mediated because demyelination is not detected in JHM-infected mice lacking T or B cells but does occur after transfer of JHM-specific T cells. Although less is known about the ability of antibodies to mediate demyelination, the presence of oligoclonally expanded B cells and high concentrations of antibodies (against self or infectious agents) in the central nervous system of many multiple sclerosis patients suggests that antibodies may also contribute to myelin destruction. Here, we show that anti-JHM antibodies, in the absence of T or B cells, caused demyelination in JHM-infected mice. Anti-JHM antibody was detected adjacent to areas of demyelination, consistent with a direct interaction between antibody and infected cells. Demyelination was reduced by 85 to 90% in infected RAG1−/− mice lacking normal expression of activating Fc receptors (FcRγ−/−) and by ∼76% when complement was depleted by treatment with cobra venom factor. These data demonstrate that JHM-specific antibodies are sufficient to cause demyelination and that myelin destruction in the presence of anti-virus antibodies results from a combination of complement- and Fc receptor-dependent mechanisms.","Kim, Taeg S.; Perlman, Stanley",The American Journal of Pathology,348,1

HLH patient survival is an area of high unmet medical need and the development of novel and effective therapeutic strategies remains of high importance. The phosphorylation-dependent activation of the Janus kinase-signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway are hallmarks of the common pathway in HLH, and several clinical trials have been initiated to investigate the role of JAK inhibitors in this disease. Aims:To characterize the immunomodulatory profile and disease modifying potential of ruxolitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor, in mouse models of primary (genetic origin) and secondary (immune trigger) HLH. Materials and Methods:For the secondary HLH model, C57BL/6 mice were injected with 50 μg of CpG DNA on days 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8. Starting on day 5, corresponding mice were treated with vehicle, ruxolitinib (P.O.), anti-IL-1R or anti-IL-6R (I.P.). In the primary (genetic) model of HLH, perforin deficient mice were infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and were treated with either standard or ruxolitinib chow starting day 4 post-infection. In both models, mouse ruxolitinib doses were designed to mimic clinically relevant JAK target inhibition. Efficacy readouts included splenomegaly, serum cytokine levels and bi-lineage cytopenias (anemia and thrombocytopenia). NanoString RNA analysis from splenocytes was performed to characterize JAK-STAT pathway regulation and downstream immunomodulation. Results: Consistent with previous results, oral ruxolitinib dosing designed to mimic clinically relevant JAK-STAT target inhibition significantly reduced CpG-induced HLH splenomegaly, and diminished pro-inflammatory cytokines KC/GRO and TNFa in the plasma and spleen. In contrast, neither anti IL-1R nor anti IL-6R blockade were effective in the CpG-induced HLH model. NanostringTM analysis confirmed that ruxolitinib treatment ameliorated the pathogenic expression pattern profile observed in vehicle treated HLH mice. In the LCMV-induced HLH model, animals treated with ruxolitinib had reduced splenomegaly and lower serum levels of inflammatory cytokines when compared with animals fed standard chow. Additionally, ruxolitinib was also able to abrogate HLH-induced anemia and thrombocytopenia. Conclusion:Ruxolitinib is a potent and selective JAK1/2 inhibitor currently being evaluated in diseases associated with cytokine storm (i.e. COVID19 NCT04377620 and NCT04362137, and HLH). Oral ruxolitinib at doses that mimic clinically achievable human JAK-STAT target inhibition significantly reduced splenomegaly and cytokines levels. This data provides additional scientific support for targeting JAK1/2 during aberrant immune hyperreactivity.

Method We systematically searched six electronic databases, unpublished sources and hand-searching of references, up to March 2020. We conducted a meta-analysis of eight independent cohorts, and narrative synthesis of the remaining studies. Results We included 20 studies, of which the majority focused on depression. Our narrative synthesis concluded that loneliness at baseline is associated with subsequent new onset of depression. The few studies on anxiety also showed an association. Our meta analysis found a pooled adjusted odds ratio of 2.33 (95% C.I. 1.62 to 3.34) for risk of new onset depression in adults who were often lonely compared with people who were not often lonely. This should be interpreted with caution given evidence of heterogeneity. Most of the studies were in older adults. Conclusion Loneliness is a public mental health issue. There is growing evidence it is associated with the onset of depression and other common mental health problems.

Patients and their families show symptoms of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress, and sleep problems. The result is that they negatively affect their quality of life. Numerous risk factors contribute to the development of this syndrome, mainly the sedation, the duration of mechanical ventilation, and the length of stay in the intensive care unit. For this reason, it is necessary to take measures to prevent this syndrome including ABCDEFGH care plan, physical rehabilitation, nutritional support, and intensive care unit diaries.

Efforts to control and prevent zoonotic disease have traditionally focused on animal-to-human transmission, or “spillover”. However, in the modern era, increasing international mobility and commerce facilitate the spread of infected humans, non-human animals (hereafter animals), and their products worldwide, thereby increasing the risk that zoonoses will be introduced to new geographic areas. Imported zoonoses can potentially ‘spill back’ to infect local wildlife—a danger magnified by urbanization and other anthropogenic pressures that increase contacts between human and wildlife populations. In this way, humans can function as vectors, dispersing zoonoses from their ancestral enzootic systems to establish reservoirs elsewhere in novel animal host populations. Once established, these enzootic cycles are largely unassailable by standard control measures and have the potential to feed human epidemics. Understanding when and why translocated zoonoses establish novel enzootic cycles requires disentangling ecologically complex and stochastic interactions between the zoonosis, the human population, and the natural ecosystem. We address this challenge by delineating potential ecological mechanisms affecting each stage of enzootic establishment—wildlife exposure, enzootic infection, and persistence—applying existing ecological concepts from epidemiology, invasion biology, and population ecology. We ground our study in the neotropics, where four arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) of zoonotic origin—yellow fever, dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses—have separately been introduced into the human population. This paper is a step towards developing a framework for predicting and preventing novel enzootic cycles in the face of zoonotic translocations.","Guth, Sarah; Hanley, Kathryn; Althouse, Benjamin M.; Boots, Mike",bioRxiv,348,29

However, these organizations need appropriate tools to measure and mitigate their climate impacts. One commonly applied method is carbon footprint analysis. Carbon footprint analyses have been conducted for various types of organizations, but knowledge organizations, such as universities and research institutes, have received far less attention, because their carbon footprint is often less visible and can be easily underestimated. This study is based on the carbon footprint analysis of one multinational knowledge organization. This analysis then helped identify the major sources of climate impacts in other such knowledge organizations. These are mainly indirect emissions (Scope 3) and to a large extent (79%) travel-related emissions. Based on these findings, three scenarios for a post-COVID-19 world were developed and analyzed. The results from the first two scenarios showed that despite a reduction in business travel and employees working from home, Scope 3 and travel-related emissions would remain the largest contributor. Only in the unlikely case of the third, non-recovery scenario did the share of travel-related emissions drop, turning heating into the largest contributor. In addition to measuring the carbon footprint, the study discusses potential mitigation strategies knowledge organizations could apply to reduce their carbon footprint. The focus is on how to avoid and reduce emissions, but new forms of carbon offsetting are also addressed. Based on the findings, a mitigation policy framework and recommendations for further research are proposed.","El Geneidy, Sami Baumeister Stefan Govigli Valentino Marini Orfanidou Timokleia Wallius Venla",Environmental Impact Assessment Review,348,20

We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), prospective case series studies and case reports that evaluated use of remdesivir in COVID-19.

The protein is encoded by one of the so-called group-specific genes and has no sequence homology with any of the known structural or group-specific proteins of coronaviruses. It does, however, have several similarities to the coronavirus M proteins; (i) they are triple membrane spanning with the same topology, (ii) they have similar intracellular localizations (predominantly Golgi), (iii) both are viral structural proteins, and (iv) they appear to interact with the E and S proteins, as well as with each other. The M protein plays a crucial role in coronavirus assembly and is glycosylated in all coronaviruses, either by N-linked or by O-linked oligosaccharides. The conserved glycosylation of the coronavirus M proteins and the resemblance of the 3a protein to them led us to investigate the glycosylation of these two SARS-CoV membrane proteins. The proteins were expressed separately using the vaccinia virus T7 expression system, followed by metabolic labeling. Pulse-chase analysis showed that both proteins were modified, although in different ways. While the M protein acquired cotranslationally oligosaccharides that could be removed by PNGaseF, the 3a protein acquired its modifications posttranslationally, and they were not sensitive to the N-glycosidase enzyme. The SARS-CoV 3a protein, however, was demonstrated to contain sialic acids, indicating the presence of oligosaccharides. O-glycosylation of the 3a protein was indeed confirmed using an in situ O-glycosylation assay of endoplasmic reticulum-retained mutants. In addition, we showed that substitution of serine and threonine residues in the ectodomain of the 3a protein abolished the addition of the O-linked sugars. Thus, the SARS-CoV 3a protein is an O-glycosylated glycoprotein, like the group 2 coronavirus M proteins but unlike the SARS-CoV M protein, which is N glycosylated.","Oostra, M; de Haan, C A M; de Groot, R J; Rottier, P J M",Journal of virology,348,20

These patients need to stop misusing opioids, but the mild-to-severe clinical symptoms associated with opioid withdrawal risk increasing their existing pain. In such cases, ketamine, which is used by anaesthetists and pain physicians to reduce opioid medication, may be an effective agent for managing opioid withdrawal. CASE PRESENTATION We describe the case of a woman who developed a severe secondary addiction to opioids in the context of lombo-sciatic pain. She presented a severe opioid addiction, and her physicians refused to prescribe such high doses of opioid treatment (oxycontin® extended-release 120 mg daily, oxycodone 60 mg daily, and acetaminophen/codeine 300 mg/25 mg 6 times per day). To assist her with her opioid withdrawal which risked increasing her existing pain, she received 1 mg/kg ketamine oral solution, and two days after ketamine initiation her opioid treatment was gradually reduced. The patient dramatically reduced the dosage of opioid painkillers and ketamine was withdrawn without any withdrawal symptoms. CONCLUSION Ketamine displays many interesting qualities for dealing with all symptoms relating to opioid withdrawal. Accordingly, it could be used instead of many psychotropic treatments, which interact with each other, to help with opioid withdrawal. However, the literature describes addiction to ketamine. All in all, although potentially addictive, ketamine could be a good candidate for the pharmacological management of opioid withdrawal.","Lalanne, Laurence; Nicot, Chloe; Lang, Jean-Philippe; Bertschy, Gilles; Salvat, Eric",BMC psychiatry,348,1

Oral agents are the cornerstone of chronic pain treatment, but their use may be limited in certain patients, particularly the elderly. Topical therapies offer advantages over systemically administered medications, including the requirement of a lower total systemic daily dose for patients to achieve pain relief, site-specific drug delivery, and avoidance of first-pass metabolism, major drug interactions, infections, and systemic side effects. Several types of topical agents have been shown to be useful in the treatment of patients with chronic pain. Both capsaicin and topical diclofenac have been shown to be effective in the treatment of patients with chronic soft-tissue pain. In patients with hand and knee osteoarthritis (OA), the American College of Rheumatology generally recommends oral treatments (acetaminophen, oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], tramadol, and intra-articular corticosteroids) and topical NSAIDs equally, favoring topical agents only for patients who have pre-existing gastrointestinal risk or are aged ≥ 75 years. Topical NSAIDs have been shown to provide relief superior to that of placebo and comparable to that of oral ibuprofen. Similarly, ketoprofen gel has been shown to be superior to placebo and similar to oral celecoxib in reducing pain in patients with knee OA. Different formulations of topical diclofenac (including the diclofenac hydroxyethyl pyrrolidine patch, diclofenac sodium gel, and diclofenac sodium topical solution 1.5% w/w with dimethyl sulfoxide USP) have been shown to be superior to placebo and comparable to oral diclofenac in the treatment of patients with pain due to knee OA, with a lower incidence of gastrointestinal complaints than with the oral formulation. In patients with neuropathic pain, topical forms of both capsaicin and lidocaine have been shown to be useful in the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia and diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain. Lidocaine has also demonstrated efficacy in relieving patient pain due to complex regional pain syndrome and may be useful in the treatment of patients with neuropathic pain who have cancer, although clinical trial results have not been consistent. Data suggest that topical therapies may offer a safe, well-tolerated, and effective alternative to systemic therapies in the treatment of patients with chronic, localized musculoskeletal and neuropathic pain.","Stanos, Steven P; Galluzzi, Katherine E",Postgraduate medicine,348,24

Yet, the mere presence of these threats is not enough to automatically predispose to illness. The susceptibility of an individual to viral or bacterial infections is dependent upon immune competence. Many factors can interfere with the functioning of the immune system. Epigenetic alterations in the form of lifestyle or environmental factors can lead to impaired immunity. For example, exposure to air pollution can increase the risk of complications and mortality from COVID-19. Obesity can also exacerbate the damaging effects of air pollution on the lungs and may enhance the association between air pollution and increased COVID-19 severity. Poor sleep is another factor leading to impaired immunity, likely due to the coinciding melatonin depletion. Melatonin has been found to have antiviral and immune-enhancing effects, and it has been proposed that this hormone may be beneficial in COVID-19 patients. Zinc and vitamins D and C have also been well studied for their ability to shorten the duration of upper respiratory infections, and vitamin D has been found to reduce mortality in COVID-19 patients. Cannabidiol can both directly and indirectly improve immunity by enhancing natural killer cell activity, reducing inflammation, and relieving stress. Other dietary supplements backed by solid scientific evidence to show they act as immune enhancers are astragalus, a yeast fermentate (EpiCor®), olive leaf extract, berberine, N-acetyl cysteine, and garlic.","Meletis, Chris D; Wilkes, Kimberly",Alternative therapies in health and medicine,348,22

Aim: To conduct a preliminary study on the establishment of a temporary integrated isolation ward during the outbreak of COVID-19 and to evaluate related impact. Methods: SWOT analysis was used to analyze the advantages, disadvantages, opportunities, and risks in the establishment of the temporary integrated isolation ward, and corresponding corrective measures were made according to the analysis results. Findings: The ward has formulated more than 10 related work procedures and prevention and control measures. A total of 93 patients with 18 critically ill patients were admitted for treatment and isolation. They were all evaluated based on established procedures and protocols. Twenty-four supplementary nucleic acid tests were ordered and conducted. One new patient with COVID-19 was confirmed and was successfully transferred to the designated COVID-19 infectious control hospital. There were no missed diagnosis or misdiagnosis, no cross-infection of patients, no cluster outbreak, and no infection of medical workers during the entire process. Conclusion: SWOT analysis is helpful in guiding the establishment of a temporary integrated isolation ward and the formulation of prevention and control measures in Hebei General Hospital during the COVID-19 outbreak. It provides the guidance and reference of significance for the establishment of similar types of wards in the future.","Zhou, Ye; Bai, Lixiang; Guo, Hao; Guo, Shaowei; Han, Xiaowen; Yue, Ning J; Li, Qingxia",Front Public Health,348,1

The development of intraindividual variability in stopping performance and its underlying neural circuitry has remained largely unstudied, even though understanding variability is of core importance for understanding development. In a total sample of 45 participants (19 children aged 10-12 years and 26 adults aged 18-26 years) of either sex we aimed to identify age-related changes in intraindividual response inhibition performance and its underlying brain signal variability. While there was no difference in average stopping performance between children and adults, stop signal latencies for the children were more variable. Further, brain signal variability during successful stopping was significantly higher in adults compared to children, especially in bilateral thalamus, but also across regions of the inhibition network. Finally, brain signal variability was significantly associated with stopping performance behavioral variability in adults. Together these results indicate that variability in stopping performance decreases, whereas neural variability in the inhibition network increases, from childhood to adulthood. Future work will need to assess whether developmental changes in neural variability drive those in behavioral variability.

Dendrimers are highly branched molecules that can be added to antiviral preparations to improve their delivery, as well as their intrinsic antiviral activity. Studies on identifying anti-MERS-CoV agents are few. Three types of polyanionic dendrimers comprising the terminal groups sodium carboxylate (generations 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, and 4.5), hydroxyl (generations 2, 3, 4, and 5), and succinamic acid (generations 2, 3, 4, and 5) and polycationic dendrimers containing primary amine (generations 2, 3, 4, and 5) were used to assess their antiviral activity with the MERS-CoV plaque inhibition assay. The hydroxyl polyanionic set showed a 17.36% to 29.75% decrease in MERS-CoV plaque formation. The most potent inhibition of MERS-CoV plaque formation was seen by G(1.5)-16COONa (40.5% inhibition), followed by G(5)-128SA (39.77% inhibition). In contrast, the cationic dendrimers were cytotoxic to Vero cells.

However, no agents have been approved to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections to date, underscoring the great need for effective and practical therapies for SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks. We reported that a focused screen of OA saponins identified 3-O-ß-chacotriosyl OA benzyl ester 2 as a novel small molecule inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 virus entry, via binding to SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein (S). We performed structure-activity relationship profiling of 2 and discovered C-17-COOH of OA was an important modification site that improved both inhibitor potency toward SARS-CoV-2 and selectivity index. Then optimization from hit to lead resulted in a potent fusion inhibitor 12f displaying strong inhibition against infectious SARS-CoV-2 with an IC50 value of 0.97 µM in vitro. Mechanism studies confirmed that inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry of 12f was mediated by the direct interaction with SARS-CoV-2 S2 subunit to block membrane fusion. These 3-O-ß-chacotriosyl OA amide saponins are suitable for further optimization as SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitors with the potential to be developed as therapeutic agents for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 virus infections.","Li, Hui; Cheng, Chen; Li, Sumei; Wu, Yan; Liu, Zhihao; Liu, Mingjian; Chen, Jianxin; Zhong, Qiuyu; Zhang, Xuesha; Liu, Shuwen; Song, Gaopeng",Eur J Med Chem,348,20

Non-COVID-19 viral respiratory illness was complicated by acute MI in 2.8% of hospitalizations, VTE in 1.6%, ischemic stroke in 0.7%, and other systemic embolism in 0.1%. The proportion of hospitalizations complicated by thrombosis was lower in patients with viral respiratory illness in 2002-2014 than in COVID-19 (5% vs 16%; P< .001). BACKGROUND: Thrombosis is a prominent feature of the novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The incidence of thrombosis during hospitalization for non-COVID-19 viral respiratory infections is uncertain. We evaluated the incidence of thrombosis in patients hospitalized with non-COVID-19 acute viral respiratory illnesses compared to COVID-19. METHODS: Adults age >18 years hospitalized with a non-COVID-19 viral respiratory illness between 2002 and 2014 were identified. The primary study outcome was a composite of venous and arterial thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI), acute ischemic stroke, and venous thromboembolism (VTE), as defined by ICD-9 codes. The incidence of thrombosis in non-COVID-19 viral respiratory illnesses was compared to the recently published incidence of thrombosis in COVID-19 from 3,334 patients hospitalized in New York in 2020. RESULTS: Among 954,521 hospitalizations with viral pneumonia from 2002 to 2014 (mean age 62.3 years, 57.1% female), the combined incidence of arterial and venous thrombosis was 5.0%. Acute MI occurred in 2.8% of hospitalizations, VTE in 1.6%, ischemic stroke in 0.7%, and other systemic embolism in 0.1%. Patients with thrombosis had higher in-hospital mortality (14.9% vs 3.3%, P< .001) than those without thrombosis. The proportion of hospitalizations complicated by thrombosis was lower in patients with viral respiratory illness in 2002-2014 than in COVID-19 (median age 64; 39.6% female) in 2020 (5% vs 16%; P< .001) CONCLUSION: In a nationwide analysis of hospitalizations for viral pneumonias, thrombosis risk was lower than that observed in patients with COVID-19.

Even after taking massive protective measures like nation-wide lockdowns, discontinuation of international flight services, rigorous testing etc., the infection spreading is still growing steadily, causing thousands of deaths and serious socio-economic crisis. Thus, the identification of the major factors of this infection spreading dynamics is becoming crucial to minimize impact and lifetime of COVID-19 and any future pandemic. In this work, a probabilistic cellular automata based method has been employed to model the infection dynamics for a significant number of different countries. This study proposes that for an accurate data-driven modeling of this infection spread, cellular automata provides an excellent platform, with a sequential genetic algorithm for efficiently estimating the parameters of the dynamics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to understand and interpret COVID-19 data using optimized cellular automata, through genetic algorithm. It has been demonstrated that the proposed methodology can be flexible and robust at the same time, and can be used to model the daily active cases, total number of infected people and total death cases through systematic parameter estimation. Elaborate analyses for COVID-19 statistics of forty countries from different continents have been performed, with markedly divergent time evolution of the infection spreading because of demographic and socioeconomic factors. The substantial predictive power of this model has been established with conclusions on the key players in this pandemic dynamics.","Ghosh, Sayantari; Bhattacharya, Saumik",,348,16

Knowledge of the H7N9 host-pathogen interactions have mainly been constrained to natural sporadic human infections. To elucidate the cellular immune mechanisms associated with disease severity and progression, we used a ferret model to closely resemble disease outcomes in humans following influenza virus infection. Intriguingly, we observed variable disease outcomes when ferrets were inoculated with the A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) strain. We observed relatively reduced antigen-presenting cell activation in lymphoid tissues which may be correlative with increased disease severity. Additionally, depletions in CD8+ T cells were not apparent in sick animals.

The method consists of stacking collected temporal snapshots into a matrix and mapping the nonlinear dynamics using a linear operator. The standard procedure considers that snapshots possess the same dimensionality for all the observable data. However, this often does not occur in numerical simulations with adaptive mesh refinement/coarsening schemes (AMR/C). This paper proposes a strategy to enable DMD to extract features from observations with different mesh topologies and dimensions, such as those found in AMR/C simulations. For this purpose, the adaptive snapshots are projected onto the same reference function space, enabling the use of snapshot-based methods such as DMD. The present strategy is applied to challenging AMR/C simulations: a continuous diffusion-reaction epidemiological model for COVID-19, a density-driven gravity current simulation, and a bubble rising problem. We also evaluate the DMD efficiency to reconstruct the dynamics and some relevant quantities of interest. In particular, for the SEIRD model and the bubble rising problem, we evaluate DMD's ability to extrapolate in time (short-time future estimates).","Barros, Gabriel F.; Grave, Mal'u; Viguerie, Alex; Reali, Alessandro; Coutinho, Alvaro L.

Many approaches highlight the importance of using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) used in conjunction with computed tomography (CT) scans. Whilst CT scans have been shown to be useful, there are multiple risks associated with them, for example radiation exposure and the transmission risk associated with repeated use of a CT suite. Therefore, it is important to analyse their diagnostic ability and limitations and to consider other methods of diagnosing COVID 19. Additionally, RT-PCR testing can have significant rates of false negatives, indicating the importance of taking a more comprehensive diagnostic approach. Here, we aim to review and analyse this literature to compare RT-PCR, serum inflammatory biomarkers, chest radiographs, ultrasound and chest CT scanning as methods of diagnosing COVID 19, particularly in asymptomatic patients.","Shammus, Rohma; Mahbub, Samiha; Rauf, Muhammad Atif; Harky, Amer",Acta Biomed,348,22

This is questioned since outcome trials of these drug classes had metformin as background therapy. In this post hoc analysis, the effect of dulaglutide on CV events was investigated according to the baseline metformin therapy by means of a subgroup analysis of the Researching Cardiovascular Events with a Weekly Incretin in Diabetes (REWIND) trial. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS : Patients in REWIND (n = 9901; women: 46.3%; mean age: 66.2 years) had type 2 diabetes and either a previous CV event (31%) or high CV risk (69%). They were randomized (1:1) to sc. dulaglutide (1.5 mg/weekly) or placebo in addition to standard of care. The primary outcome was the first of a composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and death from cardiovascular or unknown causes. Key secondary outcomes included a microvascular composite endpoint, all-cause death, and heart failure. The effect of dulaglutide in patients with and without baseline metformin was evaluated by a Cox regression hazard model with baseline metformin, dulaglutide assignment, and their interaction as independent variables. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by a Cox regression model with adjustments for factors differing at baseline between people with vs. without metformin, identified using the backward selection. RESULTS : Compared to patients with metformin at baseline (n = 8037; 81%), those without metformin (n = 1864; 19%) were older and slightly less obese and had higher proportions of women, prior CV events, heart failure, and renal disease. The primary outcome occurred in 976 (12%) participants with baseline metformin and in 281 (15%) without. There was no significant difference in the effect of dulaglutide on the primary outcome in patients with vs. without metformin at baseline [HR 0.92 (CI 0.81-1.05) vs. 0.78 (CI 0.61-0.99); interaction P = 0.18]. Findings for key secondary outcomes were similar in patients with and without baseline metformin. CONCLUSION : This analysis suggests that the cardioprotective effect of dulaglutide is unaffected by the baseline use of metformin therapy.","Ferrannini, Giulia; Gerstein, Hertzel; Colhoun, Helen Martina; Dagenais, Gilles R; Diaz, Rafael; Dyal, Leanne; Lakshmanan, Mark; Mellbin, Linda; Probstfield, Jeffrey; Riddle, Matthew Casey; Shaw, Jonathan Edward; Avezum, Alvaro; Basile, Jan Neil; Cushman, William C; Jansky, Petr; Keltai, Mátyás; Lanas, Fernando; Leiter, Lawrence Alan; Lopez-Jaramillo, Patricio; Pais, Prem; Pirags, Valdis; Pogosova, Nana; Raubenheimer, Peter Johann; Sheu, Wayne Huey-Herng; Rydén, Lars",Eur. heart j,348,16

Since fibrosis with persistent physiological deficit is a previously-described feature of patients recovering from similar coronaviruses, treatment represents an early opportunity to modify the disease course, potentially preventing irreversible impairment. OBJECTIVES: Determine the incidence of and describe the progression of persistent inflammatory interstitial lung disease (ILD) following SARS-CoV2 when treated with prednisolone. METHODS: A structured assessment protocol screened for sequelae of SARS-CoV2 pneumonitis. 837 patients were assessed by telephone four weeks after discharge. Those with ongoing symptoms had outpatient assessment at six weeks. Thirty patients diagnosed with persistent interstitial lung changes at multi-disciplinary team meeting were reviewed in the interstitial lung disease service and offered treatment. These patients had persistent, non-improving symptoms. RESULTS: At four weeks post-discharge, 39% of patients reported ongoing symptoms (325/837), and were assessed. Interstitial lung disease, predominantly organising pneumonia, with significant functional deficit was observed in 35/837 survivors (4.8%). Thirty of these patients received steroid treatment, resulting in a mean relative increase in transfer factor following treatment of 31.6% (standard deviation ± 27.64, p <0.001), and FVC of 9.6% (standard deviation ± 13.01, p = 0.014), with significant symptomatic and radiological improvement. CONCLUSION: Following SARS-CoV-2 pneumonitis, a cohort of patients are left with both radiological inflammatory lung disease and persistent physiological and functional deficit. Early treatment with corticosteroids was well tolerated and associated with rapid and significant improvement. This preliminary data should inform further study into the natural history and potential treatment for patients with persistent inflammatory ILD following SARS-CoV2 infection.","Myall, Katherine Jane; Mukherjee, Bhashkar; Castanheira, Ana Margarida; Lam, Jodie L; Benedetti, Giulia; Mak, Sze Mun; Preston, Rebecca; Thillai, Muhunthan; Dewar, Amy; Molyneaux, Philip L; West, Alex G",Ann.

In stroke, delayed or avoided care may translate to substantial morbidity. We sought to determine the effect of the pandemic on patterns of stroke patient presentation and quality of care. METHODS: We analyzed data from 25 New England hospitals: one urban, academic comprehensive stroke center and telestroke hub, and 24 spoke hospitals in the telestroke network. We included all telestroke consultations from the 24 spokes, and all stroke admissions to the comprehensive stroke center hub from November 1, 2019 through April 30, 2020. We compared rates of presentation, timeliness presentation, and quality of care pre- versus post-March 1, 2020. We examined trends in patient demographics, stroke severity, timeliness, diagnoses including large vessel occlusion, alteplase use, and endovascular thrombectomy among eligible subjects. We compared proportions and bivariate comparisons to examine for changes pre- versus post-March 1, 2020 and used linear regression to examine trends over time. RESULTS: Among 1248 patient presentations (844 telestroke consultations, 404 comprehensive stroke center admissions), telestroke consultations and ischemic stroke patient admissions decreased among the spokes and hub. Age and stroke severity were unchanged over the study period. We found no change in alteplase administration at telestroke spoke hospitals but did note a decrease in both alteplase use and thrombectomy at our comprehensive stroke center. Time metrics for patient presentation and care delivery were unchanged; however, rates of adherence for the quality measures dysphagia screening, early antithrombotic initiation, and early venous thromboembolism prophylaxis were reduced during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: In this regional analysis, we found decreasing telestroke consultations and ischemic stroke admissions, and reduced performance on stroke quality of care measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Contrary to prior reports, we did not find an increase in thrombectomy nor decrease in clinical severity that might be expected if patients with milder symptoms avoided hospitalization.","Etherton, Mark R; Zachrison, Kori S; Yan, Zhiyu; Sveikata, Lukas; Bretzner, Martin; Estrada, Juan; Viswanathan, Anand; Singhal, Aneesh B; Schwamm, Lee H",Stroke,348,20

There is an urgent need for developing therapeutic drugs and (or) biologics to prevent the spread of the virus. The life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 shows that the virus enters host cells by first binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) through its spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD). Therefore, blocking the binding between of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 RBD can inhibit the virus infection in the host cells. In this study, by grafting the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of developed SARS-CoV, MERS-CoVs specific neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) include monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) as well as SARS-CoV-2 mAbs onto a known stable nanobody (Nb) scaffold, and a total of 16 Nbs sequences were designed. Five Nbs, namely CS01, CS02, CS03, CS10, and CS16, were selected based on the free energy landscape of protein docking verified by the recently reported Nb-RBD cocrystal structures. CS01, CS02, and CS03 occupied the ACE2 binding site of RBD, while CS10 and CS16 were proposed to inhibit the interaction between RBD and ACE2 through an allosteric mechanism. Based on the structures of the five Nbs in complex with RBD, seven brand-new Nbs with enhanced binding affinities (CS02_RD01, CS03_RD01, CS03_RD02, CS03_RD03, CS03_RD04, CS16_RD01, and CS16_RD02) were generated by redesign of residues on the interface of the five Nbs contact with SARS-CoV-2 RBD.

Here, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the distinction between severe and mild phenotypes in the pathology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its origins, we performed a whole-blood-preserving single-cell analysis protocol to integrate contributions from all major immune cell types of the blood-including neutrophils, monocytes, platelets, lymphocytes and the contents of the serum. Patients with mild COVID-19 exhibit a coordinated pattern of expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs)3 across every cell population, whereas these ISG-expressing cells are systemically absent in patients with severe disease. Paradoxically, individuals with severe COVID-19 produce very high titres of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and have a lower viral load compared to individuals with mild disease. Examination of the serum from patients with severe COVID-19 shows that these patients uniquely produce antibodies that functionally block the production of the ISG-expressing cells associated with mild disease, by activating conserved signalling circuits that dampen cellular responses to interferons. Overzealous antibody responses pit the immune system against itself in many patients with COVID-19, and perhaps also in individuals with other viral infections. Our findings reveal potential targets for immunotherapies in patients with severe COVID-19 to re-engage viral defence.","Combes, Alexis J; Courau, Tristan; Kuhn, Nicholas F; Hu, Kenneth H; Ray, Arja; Chen, William S; Chew, Nayvin W; Cleary, Simon J; Kushnoor, Divyashree; Reeder, Gabriella C; Shen, Alan; Tsui, Jessica; Hiam-Galvez, Kamir J; Muñoz-Sandoval, Priscila; Zhu, Wandi S; Lee, David S; Sun, Yang; You, Ran; Magnen, Mélia; Rodriguez, Lauren; Im, K W; Serwas, Nina K; Leligdowicz, Aleksandra; Zamecnik, Colin R; Loudermilk, Rita P; Wilson, Michael R; Ye, Chun J; Fragiadakis, Gabriela K; Looney, Mark R; Chan, Vincent; Ward, Alyssa; Carrillo, Sidney; Matthay, Michael; Erle, David J; Woodruff, Prescott G; Langelier, Charles; Kangelaris, Kirsten; Hendrickson, Carolyn M; Calfee, Carolyn; Rao, Arjun Arkal; Krummel, Matthew F",Nature (Lond.),348,26

BOS is a psychological syndrome characterized by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and low personal accomplishment. An umbrella review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses concerning BOS and coronavirus (SARS/MERS/SARS-CoV-2) outbreaks was carried out on PubMed Central/Medline, Cochrane Library, PROSPERO, and Epistemonikos databases. Data relating to COVID-19 is insufficient, but in previous SARS and MERS outbreaks about one-third of HCWs manifested BOS. This prevalence rate is similar to the figure recorded in some categories of HCWs exposed to chronic occupational stress and poor work organization during non-epidemic periods. Inadequate organization and worsening working conditions during an epidemic appear to be the most likely causes of BOS. Preventive care and workplace health promotion programs could be useful for protecting healthcare workers during pandemics, as well as during regular health activities.","Magnavita, Nicola; Chirico, Francesco; Garbarino, Sergio; Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi; Santacroce, Emiliano; Zaffina, Salvatore",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),348,1

A total of 99 cases of primary endometrial carcinoma were investigated for survivin expression by immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, the association between concomitant survivin, PTEN and p53 expression, and clinicopathological parameters was examined. Immunopositivity for survivin was identified in 88% of cases. Concomitant survivin, PTEN and p53 expression (staining scores and intensity) was observed in 60% of endometrial adenocarcinomas. A significant association was identified between the sum of staining intensity and scores of survivin immunopositive cells, and patient age (P=0.028), histological grade (P<0.001), clinical stage (P=0.018) and fallopian tube and/or ovarian invasion (P=0.039). A negative tendency for correlation was observed between surivin and PTEN immunostaining scores (P=0.062; &#961;=-0.238). Specimens with high scores of survivin expression tended to show decreased scores of PTEN immunostaining, and vice versa. However, in circumstances with an increased co-expression of survivin and PTEN, a statistically significant association with histological types was observed (P=0.020). A statistically significant positive correlation was identified between survivin and p53 sum co-expression (P=0.008; &#961;=0.300). Furthermore, a significant association was identified between survivin and p53 concomitant sum expression and age of patients (P=0.001), histological type (P=0.020), clinical stage (P=0.037), histological differentiation (P=0.001) and presence of fallopian tube and/or ovarian invasion (P=0.026). The present findings suggested that survivin may be an indicator of unfavorable outcome in older patients with endometrial carcinoma, in specific circumstances that are dependent on different concomitant genetic alterations and different combinations of molecular signaling pathways. Increased expression levels of survivin and PTEN may serve a role in the development of more aggressive endometrial carcinoma during their interaction. In addition, protein expression levels of survivin and p53 are positively correlated and may share a common molecular pathway to promote endometrial carcinogenesis. These findings provided evidence that survivin and p53 combined may be useful markers for the prediction of tumor behavior and prognosis.","Stavropoulos, Aggelis; Varras, Michail; Vasilakaki, Thivi; Varra, Viktoria-Konstantina; Varra, Fani-Niki; Tsavari, Aikaterini; Nonni, Aphrodite; Kavantzas, Nikolaos; Lazaris, Andreas C",Oncol Lett,348,14

Previous severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) beta-coronavirus infections have been associated with tachyarrhythmias and signs and symptoms of heart failure. The emergence of SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19, has rapidly developed into a pandemic, and a large number of infected patients have been reported to have underlying cardiovascular disease. OBJECTIVE: Since there are only scant published data regarding cardiovascular burden in the wake of viral epidemics, this study aimed to evaluate cardiac involvement in COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This prospective cohort study included 40 adult inpatients at two centers in Germany. Adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in accordance with World Health Organization (WHO) interim guidance were included in the study, which focused on the potential cardiac involvement of SARS-CoV­2. It was based on laboratory parameters as well as electro- and echocardiographic values to determine the impact of SARS-CoV­2 virus on heart tissues. RESULTS: The conducted investigations confirmed the relationship between the presence of acute cardiac injury and COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Myocardial injury and impaired myocardial function due to COVID-19 are common; however, no correlation was established between cardiac laboratory or echocardiographic values and mortality. Cardiovascular monitoring upon COVID-19 infection is crucial to determine the burden of cardiac involvement.","Saleh, Ahmed; Matsumori, Akira; Abdelrazek, Sherif; Eltaweel, Sara; Salous, Amjad; Neumann, Franz-Josef; Antz, Matthias",Herz,348,16

However, the predictors of mortality in critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) are not yet well understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate the risk factors associated with ICU mortality in our hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this single-centered retrospective study, we enrolled 86 critically ill adult patients with COVID-19 admitted to ICU of Dokuz Eylul University Hospital (Izmir, Turkey) between 18 March 2020 and 31 October 2020. Data on demographic information, preexisting comorbidities, treatments, the laboratory findings at ICU admission and clinical outcomes were collected. The chest computerized tomography (CT) of the patients were evaluated specifically for COVID-19 and CT score was calculated. Data of the survivors and nonsurvivors were compared with survival analysis to identify risk factors of mortality in the ICU. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 71.1±14.1 years. The patients were predominantly male. The most common comorbidity in patients was hypertension. ICU mortality was 62.8%. Being over 60 years old, CT score > 15, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II score ? 15, having dementia, treatment without favipiravir, base excess in blood gas analysis ? -2.0, WBC > 10000/mm³, D-dimer > 1.6 ug/mL, troponin > 24 ng/L, Na ? 145 mmol/L were considered to link with ICU mortality according to Kaplan-Meier curves (log-rank test, p<0.05). APACHE II score (HR:1.055, 95%CI: 1.021-1.090) and chest CT score (HR:2.411, 95%CI:1.193-4.875) were associated with ICU mortality in the cox proportional-hazard regression model adjusted for age, dementia, favipiravir treatment and troponin. Howewer, no difference was found between survivors and nonsurvivors in terms of intubation timing. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients have a high ICU admission and mortality rate.

Time-varying EEG is considered an appropriate technique to explore brain regions and related activities, and nonlinear methods may extract the irregularities in the EEG signal and gather more expanded information. Therefore, we studied Shannon Entropy in EEG raw data obtained from normal subjects and compared it to data from chronic tinnitus sufferers before and after an intervention. METHODS: From the qEEG database of Iran University of Medical Sciences, the School of Rehabilitation Sciences, we have selected 23 healthy and 24 chronic tinnitus subjects. Nineteen subjects of the tinnitus group had benefited from a complete course of sound therapy (binaural beat for a month). QEEGs were measured with a 27-channel EEG amplifier in the sitting and eye-closed position for 3 min. Shannon entropy was investigated for all electrodes separately and compared among groups using a one-way ANOVA statistical test. FINDINGS: Our results revealed a significant difference between healthy and tinnitus subjects (p < 0.05). Post-hoc comparisons using the Bonferroni test showed increased entropy in the tinnitus group for all electrodes (p < 0.05) at low frequencies and most electrodes at mid frequencies. In addition, after the intervention, paired t-test showed a reduction in entropy to somehow above normal control levels for all electrodes at low-frequencies. Such results were accompanying clinical improvement after the intervention. CONCLUSION: The increased entropy in tinnitus patients might reflect the chaotic behavior of the brain. Nonlinear methods in EEG studies (Entropy) could be of great importance in understanding tinnitus neurophysiology and might potentially be a suitable criterion for clinical practice.","Sadeghijam, Maryam; Talebian, Saeed; Mohsen, Samer; Akbari, Mehdi; Pourbakht, Akram",Neurosci Lett,348,24

Many of these studies focused on reporting initial results of algorithms that were assembled from commonly used components. The choice of these components was often pragmatic rather than systematic. For instance, several studies used 2D CNNs even though these might not be optimal for handling 3D CT volumes. This paper identifies a variety of components that increase the performance of CNN-based algorithms for COVID-19 grading from CT images. We investigated the effectiveness of using a 3D CNN instead of a 2D CNN, of using transfer learning to initialize the network, of providing automatically computed lesion maps as additional network input, and of predicting a continuous instead of a categorical output. A 3D CNN with these components achieved an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.934 on our test set of 105 CT scans and an AUC of 0.923 on a publicly available set of 742 CT scans, a substantial improvement in comparison with a previously published 2D CNN. An ablation study demonstrated that in addition to using a 3D CNN instead of a 2D CNN transfer learning contributed the most and continuous output contributed the least to improving the model performance.","Vente, Coen de; Boulogne, Luuk H.; Venkadesh, Kiran Vaidhya; Sital, Cheryl; Lessmann, Nikolas; Jacobs, Colin; S'anchez, Clara I.; Ginneken, Bram van",,348,21

The recent rapid spread of disease in currently disease-free countries indicates the importance of understanding the limitations and routes of distribution. The causative agent, Capripoxvirus, can also induce sheeppox and goatpox. The economic significance of these diseases is of great concern, given that they threaten international trade and could be used as economic bioterrorism agents. The distribution of capripoxviruses seems to be expanding due to limited access to effective vaccines and poverty within farming communities. This is largely due to the economic effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and the imposition of crippling sanctions in endemic regions, as well as an increase in the legal and illegal trade of live animals and animal products, and also global climate change.

To address market demands on alcohol-based hand rubs and disinfectants, Health Canada implemented major changes to the regulations regarding composition, handling, transportation, and packaging to insure product availability. Furthermore, accelerated licensing of ingredients and packaging did not meet standard medical quality guidelines yet were authorized for manufacturing and packaging of alcohol-based hand rubs and disinfectants. The accountability associated with these policy changes were reactive, including industry self-reporting, consumer reporting, and Health Canada advisories and recalls that were responsive to products after they were available in the market. Nonetheless, Canadian public health policy increased hand sanitizers availability. However, some of the interim policies have raised major public health concerns associated with ethanol quality, packaging, and labeling, and enforcement of regulations. In this paper, we review the changes in the Canadian regulations amid the current pandemic and we evaluate the unintended health risks that might arise from these changes.","Mustafa, Rana Purdy Sarah K.; Nelson, Fina B.; Tse, Timothy J.; Wiens, Daniel J.; Shen, Jianheng Reaney Martin J.

The clinical features, severity, duration, and outcome of the disease were analyzed. RESULTS: Of 284 COVID-19 patients, the median age was 48 years (range, 18-80), and 33.80% were female. Common symptoms included fever (85.56%), shortness of breath (49.65%), cough (45.42%), and headache (40.86%). Patients with more than one comorbidity (diabetes and smoking) presented as severe-critical cases compared to healthy patients, diabetics, and smokers. Smokers presented with a lower rate of death in comparison to diabetic patients and diabetic + smoking, furthermore, smoking was less risky than diabetes. Although the mortality rate was high in patients with smokers compared to healthy patients (4.22%, the hazard ratio [HR], 1.358; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.542-1.100; p = .014), it was less than in diabetics (7.04%, HR 1.531, 95% CI: 1.668-1.337, p = .000), and diabetic plus smoker (10.00%, HR, 1.659; 95% CI, 1.763-1.510; p = .000). CONCLUSION: Multiple comorbidities are closely related to the severity of COVID-19 disease progression and the higher mortality rate.

Mouse models of Nrxn1&#945; deficiency are not amenable to studying aspects of social cognition because, in general, mice do not engage in complex social interactions such as social play or prosocial helping behaviors. Rats, on the contrary, engage in these complex, well-characterized social behaviors. Using the Nrxn1tm1Sage Sprague Dawley rat, we tested a range of cognitive and social behaviors in juveniles with haplo- or biallelic Nrxn1&#945; mutation. We found a deficit in ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) of male and female neonatal rats with Nrxn1&#945; deficiency. A male-specific deficit in social play was observed in Nrxn1&#945;-deficient juveniles, although sociability and social discrimination were unaltered. Nurturing behavior induced by exposure to pups was enhanced in male and female juveniles with biallelic Nrxn1&#945; mutation. Performance in tasks of prosocial helping behavior and food retrieval indicated severe deficits in learning and cognition in juveniles with biallelic Nrxn1&#945; mutation, and a less severe deficit in haploinsufficient rats, although Pavlovian learning was altered only in haploinsufficient males. We also observed a male-specific increase in mobility and object investigation in juveniles with complete Nrxn1&#945; deficiency. Together, these observations more fully characterize the Nrxn1tm1Sage Sprague Dawley rat as a model for Nrxn1&#945;-related neurodevelopmental disorders, and support a rationale for the juvenile rat as a more appropriate model for disorders that involve core deficits in complex social behaviors.

World Health Organization (WHO) announced that COVID-19 had become an international pandemic. There is an essential section to handle the spreading of the virus by immediate virus detection for patients. Traditional medical detection requires a long time, a specific laboratory, and a high cost. A method for detecting Covid-19 faster compared to common approaches, such as RT-PCR detection, is needed. The method demonstrated that it could produce an X-ray image with higher accuracy and consumed less time. We propose a novel method to extract image features and to classify COVID-19 using deep CNN combined with Autoencoder (AE) dubbed CAE-COVIDX. We evaluated and compared it with the traditional CNN and existing framework VGG16 involving 400 normal images of non-COVID19 and 400 positive COVID-19 diseases. The performance evaluation was conducted using accuracy, confusion matrix, and loss evaluation. Based on experiment results, the CAE-COVIDX framework outperforms previous methods in several testing scenarios. This framework's ability to detect Covid-19 in various nonstandard image X-rays could effectively help medical employers diagnose Covid-19 patients.

An even greater ownership occurred during the Covd-19 pandemic, mostly of handguns and including many new owners. The U.S. has also had the least progress of the 41 highest sociodemographic countries ranked by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation in reducing the unintentional firearm mortality rate in young children. This study characterized the unintentional firearm mortality trends in American 1-4 year-olds by sex and race/ethnicity and evaluated the trends in the context of firearm prevalence in the U.S. METHODS: Mortality data for 1999-2018 were obtained from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, firearm injury and mortality data for 2016-2020 from Everytown for Gun Safety #NotAnAccident database, firearm background check data for 1999-2020 from the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, and civilian firearm prevalence for 2017 from the Small Arms Survey. RESULTS: In American 1-4 year-olds, the rate of unintentional firearm deaths during 1999-2018 increased exponentially at an average annual percent rate of 4.9 (p < 0.001) and was greatest in non-Hispanic black children. Unintentional firearm deaths had the most rapid increase of all evaluable causes of death in the age group. The unintentional firearm death rate increase was correlated with the concurrent rate of firearm background checks and handgun permits issued (each p < 0.001) and in non-Hispanic white children with handgun prevalence in their families (p = 0.03). Globally, the unintentional firearm death rate was also correlated with firearm prevalence (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: An increase in fatal firearm accidents in the United States death rate among 1-4 year-olds is directly associated with the steadily increasing prevalence of firearms. The acceleration of firearm deaths and injuries among young Americans, especially among non-Hispanic black children, requires urgent solutions to address firearm prevalence and access. The problem is expected to become even more urgent as a result of the record high firearm sales that occurred in the United States during the 2020 coronavirus pandemic.","Bleyer, Archie; Siegel, Stuart E; Thomas, Charles R",J. natl. med. assoc,348,24

The aim of the present study was to describe the prevalence of pre-admission antithrombotic therapies in patients with COVID-19 and to investigate the potential association between antithrombotic therapy and ARDS, as disease clinical presentation, or in-hospital mortality. We enrolled 192 consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to emergency department of five Italian hospitals. The study population was divided in two groups according to the evidence of ARDS at chest computed tomography at admission. Propensity score weighting adjusted regression analysis was performed to assess the risk ARDS at admission, and death during hospitalization, in patients treated or not with antiplatelet and anticoagulant agents. ARDS was reported in 73 cases (38 %), who showed more likely hypertension compared to those without ARDS (57.8 % vs 49.6 %; P = 0.005). Thirty-five patients (18.5 %) died during the hospitalization. Not survived COVID-19 patients showed a statistically significant increased age (77 ± 8.31 vs 65.57 ± 8.31; P = 0.001), hypertension (77.1 % vs 53.5 %; P = 0.018) and coronary artery disease prevalence (28.6 % vs 10.2 %; P = 0.009). Both unadjusted and adjusted regression analyses showed no difference in the risk of ARDS at admission, or death during hospitalization, between patients treated or not with antiplatelets or anticoagulants. Pre-admission antithrombotic therapy, both antiplatelet and anticoagulant, does not seem to show a protective effect in severe forms of COVID-19 with ARDS at presentation and rapidly evolving toward death.","Russo, Vincenzo; Di Maio, Marco; Attena, Emilio; Silverio, Angelo; Scudiero, Fernando; Celentani, Dario; Lodigiani, Corrado; Di Micco, Pierpaolo",Pharmacol Res,348,26

Upon exposure to different population and changing environment, the viral strain might experience different mutational bias that leads to genetic diversity among the viral population. Also, the diversification can be influenced by distinct selection pressure on different viral genomes. We have carried out a comparative genomic analysis of 82 SARS-CoV2 genomes. We have evaluated their evolutionary divergence, substitution pattern, and rates. Viral genomes under distinct selection pressure have been identified. Sites that experience strong selection pressure also have been identified. Our result shows that the translational preference of a few codons is strongly correlated with the mutational bias imposed by genome compositional constraint and influenced by natural selection. Few genomes are evolving with a higher mutational rate with a distinct signature of nucleotide substitution in comparison to others. Four viral strains are under the effect of purifying selection, while nine SARS-CoV2 genomes are under strong positive selection bias. Site analysis indicates a strong positive selection pressure on two codon positions at 3606th and 8439th positions. Our study elucidates adaptation of few SARS-CoV2 viral strain during the outbreak shaping by natural selection and genomic compositional constraints.","Ghosh, Sanjana; Chakraborty, Sandipan",Biomed Res Int,348,7

Despite this frightening picture, denialism and noncompliance with public health measures are common in the historical record, for example during the 1918 Influenza pandemic or the 2015 Ebola epidemic. The unique characteristics of SARS-CoV-2-its high basic reproduction number (R0), time-limited natural immunity and considerable potential for asymptomatic spread-exacerbate the public health repercussions of noncompliance with interventions (such as vaccines and masks) to limit disease transmission. Our work explores the rationality and impact of noncompliance with measures aimed at limiting the spread of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: In this work, we used game theory to explore when noncompliance confers a perceived benefit to individuals. We then used epidemiological modeling to predict the impact of noncompliance on control of SARS-CoV-2, demonstrating that the presence of a noncompliant subpopulation prevents suppression of disease spread. RESULTS: Our modeling demonstrates that noncompliance is a Nash equilibrium under a broad set of conditions and that the existence of a noncompliant population can result in extensive endemic disease in the long-term after a return to pre-pandemic social and economic activity. Endemic disease poses a threat for both compliant and noncompliant individuals; all community members are protected if complete suppression is achieved, which is only possible with a high degree of compliance. For interventions that are highly effective at preventing disease spread, however, the consequences of noncompliance are borne disproportionately by noncompliant individuals. CONCLUSIONS: In sum, our work demonstrates the limits of free-market approaches to compliance with disease control measures during a pandemic. The act of noncompliance with disease intervention measures creates a negative externality, rendering suppression of SARS-CoV-2 spread ineffective. Our work underscores the importance of developing effective strategies for prophylaxis through public health measures aimed at complete suppression and the need to focus on compliance at a population level.","Stoddard, Madison; Van Egeren, Debra; Johnson, Kaitlyn E; Rao, Smriti; Furgeson, Josh; White, Douglas E; Nolan, Ryan P; Hochberg, Natasha; Chakravarty, Arijit",BMC Public Health,348,1

These discoveries provide impetus for better analytical methods to detect and characterize isomerization in proteins, which will enable a more complete understanding of the underlying relationship between these modifications and biology. Herein we employ a two-dimensional approach for identification of peptides isomers that also includes pinpointing of the modified residue. Collision-induced dissociation is used to fragment ions in the first dimension, followed by separation of the fragments with travelling-wave ion mobility. By comparing data obtained from both isomers, differences in either fragment-ion intensities or arrival-time distributions can be used to identify isomeric forms and the specific site of modification within the peptides. Synthetic peptide standards with sequences derived from long-lived proteins in the eye lens and isomerization at serine, aspartic acid, and glutamic acid were examined. Although both dimensions are capable of isomer identification, ion mobility is much better at determining the site of modification. In general, separation of isomeric forms by ion mobility is possible but does not follow predictable trends dictated by sequence or fragment-ion length. In most cases, however, the site of isomerization can be precisely determined.","Wu, Hoi-Ting; Julian, Ryan R",Analyst,348,1

In order to reduce these barriers, we intend to adapt established recommendations to manage hyperglycemia during this pandemic in critical and noncritical care settings.","Bellido, Virginia; Pérez, Antonio",,348,20

As the department that is responsible for emergency medicine teaching, we adapted the program to continue the courses and maintain the learning progress. Our objective is to evaluate the number of courses conducted and report the methods used. Methods: Teaching was measured as credit hours per week (CHW) in accordance with the university's prospectus. One CHW represents 15 academic hours (45 min) in one semester. Webinars were conducted using the CISCO Webex Events®, Webex Training, and ZOOM®. The Moodle® was utilized for resuscitation courses. Results: Courses and clerkships equivalent to 80.2 out of 101.4 CHW (79.1%) could be held during the ongoing crisis in the summer semester. Courses in the winter semester were all completed. In the human medicine curriculum, 73.7 out of 94.9 CHW (77.7%) could be conducted. In the case of emergency lectures for the dentistry curriculum, all courses were conducted through webinars (6.5 CHW, 100%). After calculating the exact number of students in each class, it has been determined that courses and clerkships equivalent to 78.7% could be conducted. Conclusion: Despite the challenge of preparing for the treatment of numerous patients during the ongoing pandemic, we could shoulder a majority of our teaching responsibilities. Although sufficient skill training could not be imparted under these circumstances, we could provide sufficient theoretical knowledge to allow students to continue studies.","Mueller, Matthias; Schriefl, Christoph; Holzer, Michael; Roeggla, Martin; Laggner, Anton N; Ettl, Florian",Front Public Health,348,30

This is a requirement to comply with international quality standards. Validating a method is a continuous process and taking part in ongoing PT programmes supports the management of a method's life cycle, providing continuing assessment of fitness (sometimes referred to as the 'validation retention status'). Proficiency-testing panel designs ensure that the methods used, particularly diagnostic specificity and sensitivity, are suitably challenged. Appraising PT results over time can illustrate whether the laboratory's performance is stable, improving or worsening, and proficiency tests can also highlight variations in the performance of assays. The development of new proficiency tests can support the implementation of novel diagnostics technologies, such as whole genome sequencing and point-of-care testing, and assist in cross-sectoral partnerships focusing on One Health approaches, which are high on the agenda for infectious disease control. For example, the rapid design and distribution of emergency exempted assays for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) means that these assays were not as rigorously evaluated as assays for established infectious diseases. Therefore, participation in PT programmes for SARS-CoV-2 is essential to understand the performance of these assays. While other mechanisms help to underpin laboratory activities, PT has been, and should remain, an integral part of laboratory quality assurance. Resources must be directed towards increasing and improving the quality of PT (for example, availability and accessibility of suitable biological and reference materials are essential for a PT provider to execute its duties), to support established and novel methods such as genomic and point-of-care tests.","Johnson, P; Cabuang, L",Rev Sci Tech,348,1

We aim to investigate the potential of deep transfer learning to predict COVID-19 infection using chest computed tomography (CT) and x-ray images. Approach: Regions of interest (ROI) corresponding to ground-glass opacities (GGO), consolidations, and pleural effusions were labeled in 100 axial lung CT images from 60 COVID-19-infected subjects. These segmented regions were then employed as an additional input to six deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures (AlexNet, DenseNet, GoogleNet, NASNet-Mobile, ResNet18, and DarkNet), pretrained on natural images, to differentiate between COVID-19 and normal CT images. We also explored the model's ability to classify x-ray images as COVID-19, non-COVID-19 pneumonia, or normal. Performance on test images was measured with global accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results: When using raw CT images as input to the tested models, the highest accuracy of 82% and AUC of 88.16% is achieved. Incorporating the three ROIs as an additional model inputs further boosts performance to an accuracy of 82.30% and an AUC of 90.10% (DarkNet). For x-ray images, we obtained an outstanding AUC of 97% for classifying COVID-19 versus normal versus other. Combing chest CT and x-ray images, DarkNet architecture achieves the highest accuracy of 99.09% and AUC of 99.89% in classifying COVID-19 from non-COVID-19. Our results confirm the ability of deep CNNs with transfer learning to predict COVID-19 in both chest CT and x-ray images.","Chaddad, A.; Hassan, L.; Desrosiers, C.",Journal of Medical Imaging,348,24

We report the dynamics of peripheral immune cells, cytokines, and human leucocyte antigen-G (HLA-G) and its receptor expressions in a patient suffering from critical COVID-19 pneumonia to convalescence. Methods: Clinical data of the patient were collected from medical records. The expressions of HLA-G and receptors ILT2, ILT4 and KIR2DL4 in peripheral immune cells were measured with flow cytometry. Results: From critical COVID-19 to the convalescent stage, early lymphopenia was improved (median: 0.6 × 109 L−1vs. 0.9 × 109 L−1, P = 0.009), and an obvious fluctuation in WBC and neutrophil counts was observed. Initially, low levels of CD4+T cells (from 120 to 528 μL−1) and CD8+T cells (from 68 to 362 μL−1) gradually increased to normal levels. Meanwhile, high IL-6 (from 251.8 to 6.32 pg mL−1), IL-10 (from 39.53 to 5.21 pg mL−1) and IFN-γ (from 13.55 to 3.16 pg mL−1) levels decreased, and IL-4 (from 2.36 to 3.19 pg mL−1) and TNF-α (from 2.27 to 20.2 pg mL−1) levels increased quickly when the viral RNA returned negative. Moreover, the percentage of HLA-G+T cells, B cells and monocytes follows high–low–high pattern, while the percentage of receptors ILT2-, ILT4- and KIR2DL4-expressing cells remained relatively stable. Conclusion: Our findings provide valuable information on the dynamics of early peripheral immunological responses in SARS-CoV-2 infection. CD4+and CD8+T cells, cytokines and HLA-G+immune cells are associated with the natural history of the critical COVID-19 patient; however, future studies are necessary.","Zhang, Sheng; Gan, Jun; Chen, Bao-Guo; Zheng, Dan; Zhang, Jian-Gang; Lin, Rong-Hai; Zhou, Yi-Ping; Yang, Wei-Ying; Lin, Aifen; Yan, Wei-Hua",Clin.

Furthermore, no clear recommendation was made for patients with a previous COVID-19 infection and a favorable outcome who were seeking bariatric surgery. OBJECTIVES: To analyze the risks of specific complications for patients with previous COVID-19 infection who were admitted for bariatric surgery. SETTING: Eight high-volume private centers from 5 countries. METHODS: All patients with morbid obesity and previous COVID-19 infection admitted for bariatric surgery were included in the current study. Patients were enrolled from 8 centers and 5 countries, and their electronic health data were reviewed retrospectively. The primary outcome was to identify early (<30 d) specific complications related to COVID-19 infection following bariatric surgery, and the secondary outcome was to analyze additional factors from work-ups that could prevent complications. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients with a mean age of 40 years (range, 21-68 yr) and a mean body mass index of 44.3 kg/m2 (±7.4 kg/m2) with previous COVID-19 infection underwent different bariatric procedures: 23 cases of sleeve (65.7 %), 7 cases of bypass, and 5 other cases. The symptomatology of the previous COVID-19 infection varied: 15 patients had no symptoms, 12 had fever and respiratory signs, 5 had only fever, 2 had digestive symptoms, and 1 had isolated respiratory signs. Only 5 patients (14.2 %) were hospitalized for COVID-19 infection, for a mean period of 8.8 days (range, 6-15 d). One patient was admitted to an intensive care unit and needed invasive mechanical ventilation. The mean interval time from COVID-19 infection to bariatric surgery was 11.3 weeks (3-34 wk). The mean hospital stay was 1.7 days (±1 d), and all patients were clinically evaluated 1 month following the bariatric procedure. There were 2 readmissions and 1 case of complication: that case was of a gastric leak treated with laparoscopic drainage and a repeated pigtail drain, with a favorable outcome. No cases of other specific complications or mortality were recorded. CONCLUSION: Minor and moderate COVID-19 infections, especially the forms not complicated with invasive mechanical ventilation, should not preclude the indication for bariatric surgery. In our experience, a prior COVID-19 infection does not induce additional specific complications following bariatric surgery.","Nedelcu, Marius; Marx, Ludovic; Lutfi, Rami Edward; Vilallonga, Ramon; Diaconu, Victor; Aboudi, Shadi; Cirera de Tudela, Arturo; Ferrer, José Vicente; Ramirez, Jose; Noel, Patrick; Nedelcu, Anamaria; Carandina, Sergio",Surg Obes Relat Dis,348,16

One current example is the cancer-causing effect from radiofrequency (RF) radiation. Studies since decades have shown increased human cancer risk. The fifth generation, 5G, for wireless communication is about to be implemented world-wide despite no comprehensive investigations of potential risks to human health and the environment. This has created debate on this technology among concerned people in many countries. In an appeal to EU in September 2017, currently endorsed by more than 400 scientists and medical doctors, a moratorium on the 5G deployment was required until proper scientific evaluation of negative consequences has been made (www.5Gappeal.eu). That request has not been taken seriously by EU. Lack of proper unbiased risk evaluation of the 5G technology makes adverse effects impossible to be foreseen. This disregard is exemplified by the recent report from the International Commission on non-ionizing radiation protection (ICNIRP) whereby only thermal (heating) effects from RF radiation are acknowledged despite a large number of reported non-thermal effects. Thus, no health effects are acknowledged by ICNIRP for non-thermal RF electromagnetic fields in the range of 100 kHz-300 GHz. Based on results in three case-control studies on use of wireless phones we present preventable fraction for brain tumors. Numbers of brain tumors of not defined type were found to increase in Sweden, especially in the age group 20-39 years in both genders, based on the Swedish Inpatient Register. This may be caused by the high prevalence of wireless phone use among children and in adolescence taking a reasonable latency period and the higher vulnerability to RF radiation among young persons.","Hardell, Lennart; Carlberg, Michael",Rev. environ. health,348,16

Among options for accelerated development is the evaluation of drug combinations in the absence of prior monotherapy data. This approach is appealing for a number of reasons. First, combining two or more drugs with related or complementary therapeutic effects permits a multipronged approach addressing the variable pathways of the disease. Second, if an individual component of a combination offers a therapeutic effect, then in the absence of antagonism, a trial of combination therapy should still detect individual efficacy. Third, this strategy is time saving. Rather than taking a stepwise approach to evaluating monotherapies, this strategy begins with testing all relevant therapeutic options. Finally, given the severity of the current pandemic and the absence of treatment options, the likelihood of detecting a treatment effect with combination therapy maintains scientific enthusiasm for evaluating repurposed treatments. Antiviral combination selection can be facilitated by insights regarding SARS-CoV-2 pathophysiology and cell cycle dynamics, supported by infectious disease and clinical pharmacology expert advice.

With respect to the outbreak data of COVID-19 epidemics in China, we find that before the inflection point, all models fail to make a reliable prediction. The Logistic function consistently underestimates the final epidemic size, while the Gompertz's function makes an overestimation in all cases. Towards statistical inference methods, the methods of sequential Bayesian and time-dependent reproduction number are more accurate at the late stage of an epidemic. And the transition-like behavior of exponential growth method from underestimation to overestimation with respect to the inflection point might be useful for constructing a more reliable forecast. Compared to ODE-based SIR, SEIR and SEIR-AHQ models, the SEIR-QD and SEIR-PO models generally show a better performance on studying the COVID-19 epidemics, whose success we believe could be attributed to a proper trade-off between model complexity and fitting accuracy. Our findings not only are crucial for the forecast of COVID-19 epidemics, but also may apply to other infectious diseases.","Yang, Wuyue; Zhang, Dongyan; Peng, Liangrong; Zhuge, Changjing; Hong, Liu",,348,29

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross-sectional prospective study was conducted in tertiary hospitals in the Uusimaa region, Finland, with 1072 volunteers being enrolled in the study from among the HCWs at the Helsinki University Hospital. Overall, 866 (80.8%) HCWs (including 588 nurses, 170 doctors, and 108 laboratory and medical imaging nurses) completed the questionnaire by July 15, 2020, with 52% of the participants taking care of COVID­19 patients. The participants answered a structured questionnaire regarding their use of PPE, the ability to follow safety guidelines, exposure to COVID­19, and the source of potential COVID­19 infections. The participants with COVID­19 symptoms were tested with the SARS-CoV-2 realtime polymerase chain reaction method. All infected participants were contacted, and their answers were confirmed regarding COVID­19 exposure. RESULTS: In total, 41 (4.7%) participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, with 22 (53.6%) of infections being confirmed or likely occupational, and 12 (29.3%) originating from colleagues. In 14 cases (63.6%), occupational infections occurred while using a surgical mask, and all infections originating from patients occurred while using a surgical mask or no mask at all. No occupational infections were found while using an FFP2/3 respirator and following aerosol precautions. The combined odds ratio for working at an intensive care unit, an emergency department, or a ward was 3.4 (95% CI: 1.2-9.2, p = 0.016). CONCLUSIONS: A high infection rate was found among HCWs despite safety guidelines. Based on these findings, the authors recommend the use of FFP2/3 respirators in all patient contacts with confirmed or suspected COVID­19, along with the use of universal masking, also in personnel rooms.","Oksanen, Lotta-Maria A H; Sanmark, Enni; Oksanen, Sampo A; Anttila, Veli-Jukka; Paterno, Jussi J; Lappalainen, Maija; Lehtonen, Lasse; Geneid, Ahmed",Int. j. occup. med. environ. health,348,16

This study describes changes in the presentation, presenting severity and disposition of patients accessing emergency services in Calgary, Alberta, during the first wave of the pandemic. METHODS: In this descriptive study, we constructed a population cohort of all patients who accessed emergency services by calling emergency medical services (EMS) (ambulance service that provides prehospital treatment and transport to medical facilities) or presenting directly to an emergency department (4 adult and 1 pediatric) or 2 urgent care centres in Calgary during the exposure period (December 2019 to June 2020) compared to 2 historical control periods (December to June, 2017-2018 and 2018-2019) combined. Outcomes included frequency of presentation, system flow indicators, patient severity, disposition and mortality. We used a locally estimated scatterplot smoothing function to visualize trends. We described differences at the maximum and minimum point of the exposure period compared to the control period. RESULTS: A total of 1 127 014 patient encounters were included. Compared to the control period, there was a 61% increase in the number of patients accessing EMS and a 35% decrease in the number of those presenting to an adult emergency department or urgent care centre in the COVID-19 period. The proportion of EMS calls for the highest-priority patients remained stable, whereas the proportion of patients presenting to an emergency department or urgent care centre with the highest-priority triage classification increased transiently by 0.9 percentage points (increase of 89%). A smaller proportion of patients were transported by EMS (decrease of 21%), and a greater proportion of emergency department patients were admitted to hospital (increase of 25%). After the first case was reported, the mortality rate among EMS patients increased by 265% (3.4 v. 12.4 per 1000 patient encounters). INTERPRETATION: The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with substantial changes in the frequency and disposition of patients accessing emergency services. Further research examining the mechanism of these observations is important for mitigating the impact of future pandemics.","Lane, Daniel J; Blanchard, Ian E; Buick, Jason E; Shaw, Marta; McRae, Andrew D",CMAJ Open,348,16

It has affected over 31 million people all over the world till date. This virus shares around 80% of genome similarity with SARS-CoV. In this perspective, we have explored three major targets namely; SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, RNA dependent RNA polymerase, and 3CL or Mpro Protease for the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. These targets have attracted attention of the medicinal chemists working on computer-aided drug design in developing new small molecules that might inhibit these targets for combating COVID-19 disease. Moreover, we have compared the similarity of these target proteins with earlier reported coronavirus (SARS-CoV). We have observed that both the coronaviruses share around 80% similarity in their amino acid sequence. The key amino acid interactions which can play a crucial role in designing new small molecule inhibitors against COVID-19 have been reported in this perspective. Authors believe that this study will help the medicinal chemists to understand the key amino acids essential for interactions at the active site of target proteins in SARS-CoV-2, based on their similarity with earlier reported viruses.

Our aim is to report on the clinical characteristics, treatments and prognoses of COVID-19. METHODS: This was a retrospective, single-centre, case series of 136 patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 at Wuhan Third Hospital in Wuhan, China, between 28 January 2020 and 12 February 2020. The clinical characteristics, laboratory tests, treatment features and prognoses were summarized. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The 136 patients were divided into a moderate (M) group (n = 103, 75.7%) and a severe and critical (SC) group (n = 33, 24.3%). There were significant differences in the incidences of concomitant chronic medical illnesses (eg, hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular disease), fever, dry cough and dyspnoea among the two groups (P < .05). Compared with those in the M group, lymphocyte count (LYM) decreased significantly in the SC group, while the serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), creatinine (Cre), D-dimer, lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), myoglobin (MB) and troponin I (cTnl) increased significantly in the SC group (P < .05). The main therapeutic drugs were antivirals, antibiotics, glucocorticoids, immunomodulators, traditional Chinese medicine preparations and symptomatic support drugs. There were significant differences in the incidences of shock, myocardial injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and renal injury among the two groups (P < .05). Among the 136 patients, 99 (72.7%) were cured, 14 (10.3%) were transferred to other hospital and 23 (16.9%) died. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Elderly patients with chronic diseases are more likely to develop severe or critical COVID-19 with multiple organ damage or systemic injuries. The improvement of LYM and CRP may be associated with the prognoses of COVID-19. The combined use of three or more antiviral drugs is to be avoided. The combination of broad-spectrum antibacterial drugs is not recommended and the risk of drug-induced liver injury should be monitored. Throughout a patient's hospitalization, their treatment plan should be evaluated and adjusted according to their vital signs, clinical symptoms, laboratory tests and imaging changes. Patients should receive effective psychological counselling.","Yang, Qiuxiang; Xie, Ling; Zhang, Wei; Zhao, Lin; Wu, HuaJun; Jiang, Jie; Zou, Jili; Liu, Jianguang; Wu, Jun; Chen, Yonggang; Wu, Jinhu",J Clin Pharm Ther,348,13

The virus is composed of the spike, membrane and envelope. On physiological smell, odoriferous substances bind to proteins secreted by sustentacular cells in order to be processed by olfactory receptor neurons. Olfactory disorder is one of the main manifestations of COVID-19, however, research is still required to clarify the mechanism involved in SARS-CoV-2 induced anosmia. OBJECTIVE: This article aims to analyze current scientific evidence intended to elucidate the pathophysiological relationship between COVID-19 and the cause of olfactory disorders. METHODS: Pubmed, Embase, Scopus and ScienceDirect were used to compose this article. The research was conducted on November 24th, 2020. Original articles with experimental studies in human, animal and in vitro, short communications, viewpoint, published in the English language and between 2019 and 2020 were included, all related to the pathophysiological relationship between olfactory disorders and COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: Both human cell receptors ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are essential for the SARS-CoV-2 entrance. These receptors are mostly present in the olfactory epithelium cells, therefore, the main hypothesis is that anosmia is caused due to damage to non-neuronal cells which, thereafter, affects the normal olfactory metabolism. Furthermore, magnetic resonance imaging studies exhibit a relationship between a reduction on the neuronal epithelium and the olfactory bulb atrophy. Damage to non-neuronal cells explains the average recovery lasting a few weeks. This injury can be exacerbated by an aggressive immune response, which leads to damage to neuronal cells and stem cells inducing a persistent anosmia. Conductive anosmia is not sufficient to explain most cases of COVID-19 induced anosmia. CONCLUSION: Olfactory disorders such as anosmia and hyposmia can be caused by COVID-19, the main mechanism is associated with olfactory epithelium damage, targeting predominantly non-neuronal cells. However, neuronal cells can also be affected, worsening the condition of olfactory loss.","Las Casas Lima, Mateus Henrique de; Cavalcante, Ana Luiza Brusiquesi; Leão, Sydney Correia",Braz. j. otorhinolaryngol.

In Europe, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) regulates the processing of personal data, including health data of value to researchers. Even during a pandemic, research still requires a legal basis for the processing of sensitive data, additional justification for its processing, and a basis for any transfer of data outside Europe. The GDPR does provide legal grounds and derogations that can support research addressing a pandemic, if the data processing activities are proportionate to the aim pursued and accompanied by suitable safeguards. During a pandemic, a public interest basis may be more promising for research than a consent basis, given the high standards set out in the GDPR. However, the GDPR leaves many aspects of the public interest basis to be determined by individual Member States, which have not fully or uniformly made use of all options. The consequence is an inconsistent legal patchwork that displays insufficient clarity and impedes joint approaches. The COVID-19 experience provides lessons for national legislatures. Responsiveness to pandemics requires clear and harmonized laws that consider the related practical challenges and support collaborative global research in the public interest.","Becker, Regina; Thorogood, Adrian; Ordish, Johan; Beauvais, Michael J S",J Med Internet Res,348,1

SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Southern Nations, Nationalities and People's Region, Ethiopia. Ten zonal towns with high population density and mobility and 1239 participants were included in the study. OUTCOME MEASURE: A semistructured questionnaire was uploaded to SurveyCTO data collection system with security patterns. Mask usage was assessed by observation, while social distancing and handwashing were assessed by interview. Data were collected by health professionals who have Bachelor of Science degree and above and analysed using SPSS V.25. Descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression were performed. RESULTS: From 1239 individuals, about half, 657 (53%), of respondents were women and about two-thirds, 795 (64.2%), were married. Nearly 9 out of 10 (90.3%) and about 8 out of 10 (82.0%) respondents reported that they frequently wash hands with soap and/or use sanitiser and keep social distancing as means to prevent COVID-19, respectively. Less than three-fifths (57.8%) of respondents wore masks during the interview. In summary, about half (48.9%) of respondents were practising the three recommended methods (social distancing, handwashing and wearing masks). Sex, educational status, family size and overall knowledge about COVID-19 were associated with practising COVID-19 prevention measures. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 prevention practice was low as only about half of participants were practising social distancing, handwashing and wearing masks. Although awareness creation has been implemented through different forms of media, it should be strengthened in different local languages. Concerned government bodies should strictly follow using masks in public gatherings.","Endriyas, Misganu; Kawza, Aknaw; Alano, Abraham; Hussen, Mamush; Shibru, Endashaw",BMJ Open,348,4

The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of this intervention on the duration of empiric CABP antibiotic therapy among patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This was a single-center, retrospective, quasi-experimental study of adult patients admitted between 3/1/2020 to 4/25/2020 with COVID-19 pneumonia, who were initiated on empiric CABP antibiotics. Patients were excluded if they were initiated on antibiotics > 48 h following admission or if another source of infection was identified. The primary outcome was the duration of antibiotic therapy (DOT) prior to the guideline (March 1 to March27, 2020) and after guideline implementation (March 28 to April 25, 2020). We also evaluated the clinical outcomes (mortality, readmissions, length of stay) among those initiated on empiric CABP antibiotics. RESULTS: A total of 506 patients with COVID-19 were evaluated, 102 pre-intervention and 404 post-intervention. Prior to the intervention, 74.5% (n = 76) of patients with COVID-19 received empiric antibiotics compared to only 42% of patients post-intervention (n = 170), p < 0.001. The median DOT in the post-intervention group was 1.3 days shorter (p < 0.001) than the pre-intervention group, and antibiotics directed at atypical bacteria DOT was reduced by 2.8 days (p < 0.001). More patients in the post-intervention group were initiated on antibiotics based on criteria consistent with our guideline (68% versus 87%, p = 0.001). There were no differences between groups in terms of clinical outcomes. CONCLUSION: Following the implementation of a guideline outlining recommendations for initiating and discontinuing antibiotics for CABP among COVID-19 inpatients, we observed a reduction in antibiotic prescribing and DOT. The guideline also resulted in a significant increase in the rate of guideline-congruent empiric antibiotic initiation.","Pettit, Natasha N; Nguyen, Cynthia T; Lew, Alison K; Bhagat, Palak H; Nelson, Allison; Olson, Gregory; Ridgway, Jessica P; Pho, Mai T; Pagkas-Bather, Jade",BMC Infect Dis,348,16

Studies elucidating the population structure, staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec types, resistance phenotypes, and virulence gene profiles of animal-associated MRSA are needed to understand spread and transmission. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine 1) clonal complexes and spa types, 2) resistance phenotypes, and 3) virulence/resistance gene profiles of MRSA isolated from animals in Switzerland. METHODS: We analyzed 31 presumptive MRSA isolates collected from clinical infections in horses, dogs, cattle, sheep, and pigs, which had tested positive in the Staphaurex Latex Agglutination Test. The isolates were characterized by spa typing and DNA microarray profiling. In addition, we performed antimicrobial susceptibility testing using the VITEK 2 Compact system. RESULTS: Characterization of the 31 presumptive MRSA isolates revealed 3 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius isolates, which were able to grow on MRSA2 Brilliance agar. Of the 28 MRSA isolates, the majority was assigned to CC398 (86%), but CC8 (11%) and CC1 (4%) were also detected. The predominant spa type was t011 (n = 23), followed by t009 (n = 2), t034 (n = 1), t008 (n = 1), and t127 (n = 1).

Furthermore, adequately fitted N95 respirators and KF94 masks are essential. We investigated the fit tests to determine whether healthcare workers had adequate protection with N95 respirators and KF94 masks. METHODS: In this prospective single-center simulation study, five N95 respirators (two made in the USA by 3M and three made in Korea) and six KF94 masks, the Korean standard medical masks, were tested. The fit factor (FF) and leakage rate were evaluated using a two-fit test device. Adequate protection (defined as FF &#8805; 100 or leakage rate &#8804; 5) rates were compared between N95 respirators and KF94 masks, and between made in Korea and the 3M N95 respirators. For KF94 masks, adequate protection rates were compared before and after ear strap fixation. RESULTS: Overall, 30 participants were enrolled, and 330 fit tests were performed for FF and leakage rate. Adequate protection rates of all tested N95 respirators and KF94 masks were 22.7% (n = 75) by FF and 20.6% (n = 68) by leakage rate. N95 respirators showed a significantly higher adequate protection rate than KF94 masks for FF (48.7% vs. 1.1%, P < 0.001) and leakage rate (42.0% vs. 2.8%, P < 0.001). Adequate protection rate of 3M-made N95 respirators was significantly higher than that of those made in Korea (83.3% vs. 25.6% in FF, P < 0.001; 73.3% vs. 21.1% in leakage rate, P < 0.001). In KF94 masks, after fixation of ear strap with a hook, adequate protection rate improved significantly (1.1% vs. 12.8% in FF, P < 0.001; 2.8% vs. 11.1%, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Although adequate protection rate of N95 respirators was higher than that of KF94 masks, N95 respirator protection rate was not optimum. Thus, it is necessary to minimize exposure to risk by selecting an appropriate mask or respirator that adequately fits each person, and by wearing respirators or masks appropriately, before contacting the patients. With their superior protection rate, wearing N95 respirators is recommended instead of KF94 masks, especially when performing aerosol-generating procedures.","Park, Jin Ju; Seo, Yu Bin; Lee, Jacob",J Korean Med Sci,348,30

We sought to ascertain the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare delivery for pediatric patients with IF. METHODS: A 20-question survey was administered to members of the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition Intestinal Rehabilitation (IR) Special Interest Group. Input values were ""yes"" and ""no,"" along with a free-text response. Following a 10-day open survey period, data were divided into cohorts based on patient population size and disease burden by state. Analysis was then performed using the &#967;2 test application. RESULTS: Responses from 29 centers were included in analysis. Centers that followed >50 patients on parenteral nutrition (PN) were more likely to have social workers present in telemedicine visits and observed more central line difficulties among families. Centers located in states with <40,000 reported cases of COVID-19 saw patients less frequently and were more likely to withhold changes to PN prescriptions. Additionally, the survey revealed a significant degree of financial hardship and food insecurity among families. CONCLUSION: Many aspects of pediatric IF healthcare delivery have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, both for care providers and caregivers. Despite the availability of telemedicine, IR centers should remain attentive to the global needs of the pediatric IF patient, as well as their families.","Galloway, David P; Mathis, Michelle S; Wilkinson, Linda T; Venick, Robert S; Wendel, Danielle; Cole, Conrad R; Martin, Colin A",JPEN J. parenter. enteral nutr,348,1

We demonstrate that sealed UV-C flow reactors operating with fluences near 253 ± 1 nm of 13.9-49.6 mJ cm-2 efficiently inactivate coronaviruses in an aerosol. For measurements, porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) was nebulized in a custom-built, 3.86 m wind tunnel housed in a biosafety level class II facility. The single pass log10 reduction of active coronavirus was in excess of 2.2 at a flow rate of 2439 L min-1 (13.9 mJ cm-2) and in excess of 3.7 (99.98% removal efficiency) at 684 L min-1 (49.6 mJ cm-2). Because virus titers resulting from sampling downstream of the UV-C reactor were below the limit of detection, the true log reduction is likely even higher than measured. Comparison of virus titration results to reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR and measurement of fluorescein concentrations (doped into the nebulized aerosol) reveals that the reduction in viable PRCV is primarily due to UV-C based inactivation, as opposed to physical collection of virus. The results confirm that UV-C flow reactors can efficiently inactivate coronaviruses through incorporation into HVAC ducts or recirculating air purifiers.","Qiao, Yuechen; Yang, My; Marabella, Ian A; McGee, Devin A J; Aboubakr, Hamada; Goyal, Sagar; Hogan, Christopher J; Olson, Bernard A; Torremorell, Montserrat",Environ. sci. technol,348,24

We describe key features and early learnings of these programs in the hospital setting. METHODS: Relevant clinical and operational leadership from an academic medical center, pediatric teaching hospital, and safety net county health system met to share learnings shortly after deploying inpatient telemedicine. A summative analysis of their learnings was re-circulated for approval. RESULTS: All three institutions faced pressure to urgently standup new telemedicine systems while still maintaining secure information exchange. Differences across patient demographics and technological capabilities led to variation in solution design, though key technical considerations were similar. Rapid deployment in each system relied on readily available consumer-grade technology, given the existing familiarity to patients and clinicians and minimal infrastructure investment. Preliminary data from the academic medical center over one month suggested positive adoption with 631 inpatient video calls lasting an average (standard deviation) of 16.5 minutes (19.6) based on inclusion criteria. DISCUSSION: The threat of an imminent surge of COVID-19 patients drove three institutions to rapidly develop inpatient telemedicine solutions. Concurrently, federal and state regulators temporarily relaxed restrictions that would have previously limited these efforts. Strategic direction from executive leadership, leveraging off-the-shelf hardware, vendor engagement, and clinical workflow integration facilitated rapid deployment. CONCLUSION: The rapid deployment of inpatient telemedicine is feasible across diverse settings as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Vilendrer, Stacie; Patel, Birju; Chadwick, Whitney; Hwa, Michael; Asch, Steven; Pageler, Natalie; Ramdeo, Rajiv; Saliba-Gustafsson, Erika A; Strong, Philip; Sharp, Christopher",J Am Med Inform Assoc,348,24

Treatment efforts have been severely impeded due to the lack of specific effective antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-associated pathologies. In the present research endeavour the inhibitory prospects of cyanobacterial metabolites were assessed at the active binding pockets of the two vital SARS-CoV-2 proteases namely, main protease (Mpro) and the papain-like protease (PLpro) that proteolytically process viral polyproteins and facilitate viral replication, employing an in silico molecular interaction-based approach. It was evident from our analysis based on the binding energy scores that the metabolites cylindrospermopsin, deoxycylindrospermopsin, carrageenan, cryptophycin 52, eucapsitrione, tjipanazole, tolyporphin and apratoxin A exhibited promising inhibitory potential against the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The compounds cryptophycin 1, cryptophycin 52 and deoxycylindrospermopsin were observed to display encouraging binding energy scores with the PLpro of SARS-CoV-2. Subsequent estimation of physicochemical properties and potential toxicity of the metabolites followed by robust molecular dynamics simulations and analysis of MM-PBSA energy scoring function established deoxycylindrospermopsin as the most promising inhibitory candidate against both SARS-CoV-2 proteases. Present research findings bestow ample scopes to further exploit the potential of deoxycylindrospermopsin as a successful inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and in vivo and pave the foundation for the development of novel effective therapeutics against COVID-19.

OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that the observed low incidence of perinatal infection could be related to a low expression of the membrane receptor for SARS-CoV2, ACE2, in the fetal-placental unit. We evaluated protein expression of ACE2 both in placentas and fetal organs from non-infected pregnancies across gestation. METHODS: Discovery study. Immunocytochemistry analysis for ACE2 in organs and placentas were performed in May 2020, in samples from a registered biobank. Five cases of medical termination of pregnancy performed at between 15 and 38 weeks' in healthy women. Paraffin-embedded tissues (kidneys, brain, lungs, intestinal tract, heart). Matching tissues from 8-year-old children (N=4) were tested as controls. Seven placentas including those of the 5 cases, 1 of a 7-week miscarriage and 1 of a symptomatic SARS-COV2 pregnancy at 34 weeks. Tissues' sections were incubated with rabbit monoclonal anti-ACE2. Protein expression of ACE2 was detected by immunochemistry. RESULTS: ACE2 expression was detected in fetal kidneys, rectum and ileum across gestation and similarly in the pediatric control. It was barely detectable in lungs at 15 weeks' and not found thereafter. In the pediatric control, ACE2 was only detectable in type 2 pneumocytes. No ACE2 expression was found in the cerebral ependymal, parenchyma nor in cardiac tissues ACE2 was expressed in syncitiotrophoblast and cytotrophoblast from 7th weeks' onwards and across gestation but not in the amnion. Similar intensity and distribution of ACE2 staining were identified in the mother's SARS-CoV2 placenta. CONCLUSIONS: Marked placental expression of ACE2 provides a rationale for vertical transmission at cellular level. Absence of ACE2 expression in the fetal brain and heart is reassuring on the risk of congenital malformation. Clinical follow-up of infected pregnant women and their children are needed to validate these observations. This article is protected by copyright.

METHODS.: Anonymized data from the regional psychiatric care register have been obtained and analyzed. The seven GHPWs care for approximately 1.4 million inhabitants and have a total of 119 beds. RESULTS.: In the 40-day period (February 21-March 31, 2020) after the start of the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy, compared to a similar 40-day period prior to February 21, and compared to two 40-day periods of 2019, there has been a marked reduction in psychiatric admission rates. The reduction was explained by voluntary admissions, while there was not a noticeable reduction for involuntary admissions. The reduction was visible for all diagnostic groups, except for a group of 'Other' diagnoses, which includes anxiety disorders, neurocognitive disorders, etc. CONCLUSIONS.: Large-scale pandemics can modify voluntary admission rates to psychiatric facilities in the early phases following pandemic onset. We suggest that the reduction in admission rates may be due to fear of hospitals, seen as possible sites of contagion, as well as to a change in thresholds of behavioral problems acting as a trigger for admission requests from family relatives or referrals from treating clinicians. It is unclear from the study whether the reduction in admissions was contributed to most by the current pandemic or the lockdown imposed due to the pandemic.","Clerici, M; Durbano, F; Spinogatti, F; Vita, A; de Girolamo, G; Micciolo, R",Ir J Psychol Med,348,20

Here we present a series of 3D adaptive mesh refinement radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the collapse of initially turbulent, massive pre-stellar cores. Our simulations include radiative feedback from both the direct stellar and dust-reprocessed radiation fields, and collimated outflow feedback from the accreting stars. We find that protostellar outflows punches holes in the dusty circumstellar gas along the star's polar directions, thereby increasing the size of optically thin regions through which radiation can escape. Precession of the outflows as the star's spin axis changes due to the turbulent accretion flow further broadens the outflow, and causes more material to be entrained. Additionally, the presence of magnetic fields in the entrained material leads to broader entrained outflows that escape the core. We compare the injected and entrained outflow properties and find that the entrained outflow mass is a factor of $\sim$3 larger than the injected mass and the momentum and energy contained in the entrained material are $\sim$25% and $\sim$5% of the injected momentum and energy, respectively. As a result, we find that, when one includes both outflows and radiation pressure, the former are a much more effective and important feedback mechanism, even for massive stars with significant radiative outputs.","Rosen, Anna L.; Krumholz, Mark R.",,348,16

CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the case of a 65-year-old man who had presented with epistaxis and serous rhinorrhea. When he had fallen to the ground near his bee boxes, a garden pole had poked into his right nostril. He had instantly removed the pole from his nostril himself. However, immediately after removal of the pole, he had developed nasal bleeding and serous rhinorrhea. He then drove to our emergency room. Computed tomography showed pneumocephalus with a minor cerebral contusion in the left frontal lobe and a penetrating injury in the left anterior skull base. His CSF leakage had not resolve spontaneously within 1 week after the injury with strict bed rest. We repaired the CSF leakage using a fat (adipose tissue)-on-fascia autograft plug and caulked the defect in the anterior skull base with the fat-on-fascia graft (FFG) plug through the left nostril with endoscopic guidance. The CSF rhinorrhea was successfully controlled. Intranasal local application of fluorescein aided in the detection of the direction of flow of the CSF leakage. CONCLUSIONS: Endonasal endoscopic caulking of a skull base defect using an FFG plug can be useful to treat CSF leakage due to the localized skull base defect, especially in the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. It is simple, inexpensive, and timesaving. It requires no special skills nor sophisticated instruments that can cause aerosolization, reducing the risk of infection during the surgery.","Yoneoka, Yuichiro; Aizawa, Naotaka; Nonomura, Yoriko; Ogi, Manabu; Seki, Yasuhiro; Akiyama, Katsuhiko",World Neurosurg,348,1

However, the cardiovascular system is greatly affected by these conditions and is often responsible for complications and mortality of these patients. In order to show the cardiovascular implications in patients infected with COVID-19 and the importance of social isolation as an alternative to curb the spread of the disease, a literature review was carried out based on 37 articles, in English, Portuguese and Spanish, available on Scielo and PubMed. The findings showed that cardiac complications associated with COVID-19 infection are similar to those produced by: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and influenza. However, COVID-19 has a much greater and faster contamination and, unlike influenza, there is no vaccine or treatment available yet. In view of this, social isolation becomes a tool that can reduce and flatten the curve of cases and thus protect the people at higher risk, decreasing the chances of serious conditions related to the disease, potential deaths and the collapse of the country's health system.","Costa, Juliana Alves; Silveira, Juliana de Almeida; Santos, Sara Cristine Marques Dos; Nogueira, Patrícia Pereira",Arq Bras Cardiol,348,21

Immunocompromised patients are within the high-risk group to severe outcomes from COVID-19. However, there is no clear evidence of the association between impaired immune host status and complications from SARS-CoV-2 infection so far. The virus is transmitted by inhalation or direct contact with infected secretions, and therefore the dental office is a highly susceptible environment for such transmission. Here, we review the literature and discuss immunological COVID-19 related issues. We also make suggestions for immunocompromised patients' support in this new emerging context of clinical dental practice. Until comprehensive findings are published, individuals with impaired immunity should be considered as high-risk. Cross infection control procedures for the clinical care of immunocompromised patients should follow the same guidelines that are being proposed for immunocompetent ones. However, during the active outbreak, people under immunosuppressive conditions should not receive elective procedures, even if they do not have symptoms or exposure history to COVID-19, and in case of emergence, care must be done in a separate airborne room. In the pos-pandemic phase, the dental care general recommendations should be the same for all subjects. Changes in the current guidelines have been proposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection control in order to provide the best and safe dental practice. However, they still need to be validated by future studies.","Martins-Chaves, Roberta Rayra; Gomes, Carolina Cavaliéri; Gomez, Ricardo Santiago",Braz Oral Res,348,16

Therefore, to find out what kind of employees have cooperated with the company's measures in the current corona (COVID-19) crisis, and what effect the cooperation has had to these employees/companies to get hints for preparing for the next crisis, the pass analysis was carried out using awareness data obtained from a questionnaire survey conducted on 2,973 employees of Japanese companies in China. The results showed that employees with higher social capital and resilience were more supportive of the company's measures against corona and that employees who were more supportive of corona measures were less likely to leave their jobs. However, regarding fatigue and anxiety about the corona felt by employees, it was shown that it not only works to support cooperation in corona countermeasures but also enhances the turnover intention. This means that just by raising the anxiety of employees, even if a company achieves the short-term goal of having them cooperate with the company's countermeasures against corona, it may not reach the longer-term goal by making them increase their intention to leave. It is important for employees to be aware of the crisis and to fear it properly. But more than that, it should be possible for the company to help employees stay resilient, build good relationships with them, and increase their social capital to make them support crisis measurement of the company most effectively while keeping their turnover intention low.","Kokubun, Keisuke; Ino, Yoshiaki; Ishimura, Kazuyoshi",,348,24

RESULTS: All patients presented with various main complaints such as fever, cough, shortness of breath, and diarrhea. An increase in D-dimer value was found in all cases, with an increase of 4–5 times from the upper limit of normal. All patients were evaluated with the IMPROVE-VTE and PADUA thrombotic risk assessment models. Thromboprophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin LMWH intensive dosage was given to four patients. However, one patient was not given thromboprophylaxis because of the high risk of bleeding. All cases were not given long-term thromboprophylaxis after the patients were discharged from the hospital. All hospitalized COVID-19 patients can be considered to give thromboprophylaxis unless contraindicated. Thromboprophylaxis is preferable to use LMWH with a dose adjusted to the severity of COVID-19.

The detection of COVID-19 at the earliest stage is therefore of paramount importance for controlling the pandemic spread and reducing the mortality rate. The real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, the primary method of diagnosis for coronavirus infection, has a relatively high false negative rate while detecting early stage disease. Meanwhile, the manifestations of COVID-19, as seen through medical imaging methods such as computed tomography (CT), radiograph (X-ray), and ultrasound imaging, show individual characteristics that differ from those of healthy cases or other types of pneumonia. Machine learning (ML) applications for COVID-19 diagnosis, detection, and the assessment of disease severity based on medical imaging have gained considerable attention. Herein, we review the recent progress of ML in COVID-19 detection with a particular focus on ML models using CT and X-ray images published in high-ranking journals, including a discussion of the predominant features of medical imaging in patients with COVID-19. Deep Learning algorithms, particularly convolutional neural networks, have been utilized widely for image segmentation and classification to identify patients with COVID-19 and many ML modules have achieved remarkable predictive results using datasets with limited sample sizes.","Rehouma, Rokaya Buchert Michael Chen Yi-Ping Phoebe",International Journal of Intelligent Systems,348,1

The immune response via cellular immunity creates superior resistance to viral mutations, which are currently the greatest threat to the global vaccination campaign. Furthermore, we also propose a safer, more facile and physiologically appropriate immunization method using either intra-nasal or oral administration. The underlying technology is an adaptation of synthetic long peptides (SLPs) previously used in cancer immunotherapy. SLPs comprising HLA class I and class II epitopes are used to stimulate antigen cross-presentation and canonical class II presentation by dendritic cells. The result is a cytotoxic T cell-mediated prompt and specific immune response against the virus-infected epithelia and a rapid and robust virus clearance. Peptides isolated from COVID-19 convalescent patients were screened for the best HLA population coverage and were tested for toxicity and allergenicity. 3D peptide folding followed by molecular docking studies provided positive results, suggesting a favourable antigen presentation.","Tirziu, Alexandru; Paunescu, Virgil",,348,26

The objective of this study was to investigate droplet and splatter patterns resulting from common endoscopic endonasal procedures. STUDY DESIGN: Cadaver simulation series. SETTING: Dedicated surgical laboratory. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: After instilling cadaver head specimens (n = 2) with fluorescein solution, endoscopic endonasal procedures were systematically performed to evaluate the quantity, size, and distance of droplets and splatter following each experimental condition. RESULTS: There were no observable fluorescein droplets or splatter noted in the measured surgical field in any direction after nasal endoscopy, septoplasty with microdebrider-assisted turbinoplasty, cold-steel functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS), and all experimental conditions using an ultrasonic aspirator. Limited droplet spread was noted with microdebrider FESS (2 droplets, <1 mm in size, within 10 cm), drilling of the sphenoid rostrum with a diamond burr (8, <1 mm, 12 cm), and drilling of the frontal beak with a cutting burr (5, <1 mm, 9 cm); however, the use of concurrent suction while drilling resulted in no droplets or splatter. The control condition of external activation of the drill resulted in gross contamination (11, 2 cm, 13 cm). CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that there is very little droplet generation from routine rhinologic procedures. The droplet generation from drilling was mitigated with the use of concurrent suction. Extreme caution should be used to avoid activating powered instrumentation outside of the nasal cavity, which was found to cause droplet contamination.","Sharma, Dhruv; Rubel, Kolin E; Ye, Michael J; Shipchandler, Taha Z; Wu, Arthur W; Higgins, Thomas S; Burgin, Sarah J; Ting, Jonathan Y; Illing, Elisa A",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,348,12

METHODS: Fifty-two cases of COVID-19 were admitted in the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine. The consecutive chest CT scans were followed up for all patients with an average of 4 scans performed per patient during the hospitalization. The shortest interval between each scan was 2 days and the longest was 7 days. The shape, number and distribution of lung shadows, as well as the characteristics of the lesions on the CT images were reviewed. RESULTS: The obvious shadows infiltrating the lungs were shown on CT images in 50 cases, for other 2 cases there was no abnormal changes in the lungs during the first CT examination. Ground-glass opacities (GGO) were found in 48 cases (92.3%), and 19 cases (36.5%) had patchy consolidation and sub-consolidation, which were accompanied with air bronchi sign in 17 cases (32.7%). Forty one cases (78.8%) showed a thickened leaflet interval, 4 cases (7.6%) had a small number of fibrous stripes.

The etiologic agent responsible for this disease has been named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses as it shows similar genomic features to that of SARS-CoV which caused a pandemic in 2002. This disease first appeared in Hubei province of China and it follows human-to-human transmission but the path this virus took to set up human infection remains a mystery. By 17 April 2020, globally there have been 2,074,529 confirmed cases with 139,378 deaths because of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 shows several similarities with SARS?CoV, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) with its clinical presentations. This can vary from asymptomatic infection to severe disease and mortality. Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) screening is considered as the standard laboratory test for the diagnosis of COVID-19. There is no proven antiviral agent against SARS-CoV-2 so the treatment for COVID-19 is symptomatic, aiming for the management of the symptoms and prevention of the complications. The outbreak of COVID-19 has led to the implementation of extraordinary public health measures throughout the world.

All hospitals need adopt measures to protect patients and health professionals and to safely triage patients (according to country/regional directives) for identifying those infected with corona-virus. As very few guidelines are available for care of cancer patients during COVID times, institutes have had to make their own strategies, based on their own expertise keeping in mind local directives and their effect on available resources and routine pro-cesses to offer best possible care. In this article, we have discussed in-house protocols for modification and prioritization of radical and palliative multimodality treatment of cancer patients along with our infection control measures in accordance with national and local guidelines during COVID emergency to stay safe and health.

Morphologies, textures, surface functionalities, and thermal stabilities of both adsorbents were explored using SEM, EDX, TEM, BET, FT-IR, Raman, XRD and TGA analyses. SEM analysis showed meso- and macroporous surfaces. BET data showed that the MAG–OSBC possesses a larger surface area (33.82 m(2)/g) and pore volume. Batch adsorption studies were conducted following the experimental scenario of Box–Behnken (BB) design. The adsorption efficiency of both adsorbents was evaluated in terms of the % removal (%R) and the sorption capacity (q(e), mg/g). Dependent variables (%R and q(e)) were maximized as a function of four factors: pH, sorbent dose (AD), the concentration of CLOF ([CLOF]), and contact time (CT). A %R of 98.10% and 98.61% could be obtained using OSBC and MAG–OSBC, respectively. Equilibrium studies indicated that both Langmuir and Freundlich models were perfectly fit for adsorption of CLOF. Maximum adsorption capacity (q(max)) of 174.03 mg/g was obtained using MAG–OSBC. Adsorption kinetics could be best illustrated using the pseudo-second-order (PSO) model. The adsorption–desorption studies showed that both adsorbents could be restored with the adsorption efficiency being conserved up to 92% after the sixth cycles.","El-Azazy, Marwa; Nabil, Iman; Hassan, Siham S.; El-Shafie, Ahmed S.",Nanomaterials (Basel),348,16

Information on this life-threatening pandemic of COVID-19 is sparse and discrete; and the urgency is such that the dissemination of information is increasing with numerous daily publications on the topic. Therefore, we developed a comprehensive review on various aspects of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. We scientifically compiled published research, news, and reports from various sources to comprehend and summarize the information and findings on Coronaviruses. The review explicitly covers the aspects like genome and pedigree of SARS-CoV-2; epidemiology, prognosis, pathogenesis, symptoms and diagnosis of COVID-19 in order to catalog the right information on transmission route, and influence of environmental factors on virus transmissions, for the robust understanding of right strategical steps for proper COVID-19 management. We have explicitly highlighted several useful information and facts like: i) No established relationship between progression of SARS-CoV-2 with temperature, humidity and/or both, ii) The underlying mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 is not fully understood, iii) Respiratory droplet size determines drop and airborne-based transmission, iv) Prognosis of COVID-19 can be done by its effects on various body organs, v) Infection can be stopped by restricting the binding of S protein and AE2, vi) Hydroxychloroquine is believed to be better than chloroquine for COVID-19, vii) Ivermectin with Vero-hSLAM cells is able to reduce infection by ~5000 time within 2 days, and viii) Nafamostat mesylate can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 S protein-initiated membrane fusion.

Because of the long-term effects of COVID-19, medical institutions had to make timely adjustments to control policies and priorities to balance between COVID-19 prevention and daily medical services. METHODOLOGY: The framework for infection prevention and control in the inpatient department was effectively organized at both hospital and department levels. A series of prevention and control strategies was implemented under this leadership: application of rigorous risk assessment and triage before admission through a query list; classifying patients into three risk levels and providing corresponding medical treatment and emergency handling; establishing new ward visiting criteria for visitors; designing procedures for PPE and stockpile management; executing specialized disinfection and medical waste policies. RESULTS: Till June 2020, the bed occupancy had recovered from 20.0% to 88.1%. In total, 13045 patients were received in our hospital, of which 54 and 127 patients were identified as high-risk and medium-risk, respectively, and 2 patients in the high-risk group were eventually laboratory-confirmed with COVID-19. No hospital-acquired infection of COVID-19 has been observed since the emergency appeared. CONCLUSIONS: The strategies ensured early detection and targeted prevention of COVID-19 following the COVID-19 pandemic, which improved the recovery of medical services after the pandemic.","Liu, Shuang; Ren, Yan; Li, Hong; Liu, Yue; Shan, Jiao; Yang, Lin; Chen, Lihong; Chen, Hui",J Infect Dev Ctries,348,23

Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted among 429 RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients who were on follow up from July to October 2020 and with complete clinical and laboratory data. Data was described using frequency tables. Robust Poisson regression model was used to identify predictors of COVID-19 disease severity where adjusted relative risk (RR), P-value and 95% CI for RR were used to test significance and interpretation of results. Binary Logistic regression model was used to assess the presence of statistically significant association between the explanatory variables and COVID-19 disease outcome where adjusted odds ratio, P-value and 95% CI for adjusted odds ratio were used for testing significance and interpretation of results Results: Among the 429 patients studied, 182 (42.4%) had Severe disease at admission and the rest 247 (57.6%) had Non-severe disease (15.6% mild and 42.0% moderate). Regarding disease outcome, 45 (10.5%) died and 384 (89.5%) were discharged alive.

The following factors were significantly associated with COVID-19 disease outcome; age group (AOR= 2.767, 95% CI= 1.099 - 6.067, p-value=0.031), white blood cell count (AOR= 4.253, 95% CI= 1.918 - 9.429, p-value=0.0001) and sodium level (AOR= 3.435, 95% CI= 1.439, 8.198, p-value=0.005). Conclusions: The laboratory markers of NLR of above three, raised SGOT and deranged sodium and potassium levels (both hypo- and hyper-states) were found to be significant predictors of developing severe COVID-19 disease. In addition, deranged values of white blood cell count and sodium levels were significantly associated with worse outcome of the disease. Therefore, assessing and monitoring these laboratory markers at the earliest stage of the disease could have a considerable impact in halting disease progression and death.

METHOD: I provide a historical overview of Milwaukee, Wisconsin—one of the most segregated cities in the U.S.—to consider prior health disparities and social conditions. I then focus on COVID-19, tracking the monthly census tract distribution of cases for 6 months, including case and mortality data by race and class. RESULTS: As expected, Black and Hispanic majority census tracts are the most affected by COVID-19, with some communities experiencing nearly 1 positive case per 10 residents. In previous years, Blacks and Hispanics provided approximately 27% and 3% of the shares of “natural” deaths, respectively; their shares of COVID-19 deaths in the first 6 months of the pandemic were approximately 35% and 13%. On the contrary, the share of natural deaths for whites was approximately 65% in previous years and dropped to 47% for COVID-19 deaths. The average ages of COVID-19 deaths were 72.5 for Blacks, 61.3 for Hispanics, and 79.9 for whites. CONCLUSION: The disparities in COVID-19 outcomes in Milwaukee cannot be separated from historical forces, including race-based politics that intensified during the Great Migration of African Americans from the Jim Crow South.

In this review, we critically summarise evidence on trends and changes in burnout over the past decade, contributors to surgical trainee burnout, the personal and professional consequences of burnout and consider the evidence for interventions. There is no evidence for a linear increase in burnout levels in surgeons over the past decade but the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has yet to be established and is likely to be significant. Working long hours and experiencing stressful interpersonal interactions at work are associated with higher burnout in trainees but feeling more supported by training programmes and receiving workplace supervision are associated with reduced burnout. Burnout is associated with poorer overall mental and physical well-being in surgical trainees and has also been linked with the delivery of less safe patient care in this group. Useful interventions could include mentorship and improving work conditions, but there is a need for more and higher quality studies.","Johnson, Judith; Al-Ghunaim, Tmam Abdulaziz; Biyani, Chandra Shekhar; Montgomery, Anthony; Morley, Roland; O’Connor, Daryl B.",Indian J Surg,348,16

Homology modeling of the construct was done using SWISS-MODEL and then docked with different toll-like-receptors (TLR4, TLR7, and TLR8) using PatchDock, HADDOCK, and FireDock, respectively. From the overlapped epitopes, we designed five vaccine constructs C1–C5.

METHODS: We describe a patient who developed new-onset central hypocortisolism in the convalescent phase of mild COVID-19, which has not been previously reported. RESULTS: A 47-year-old man with recent COVID-19 upper respiratory tract infection developed new-onset persistent dyspepsia and eosinophilia for which multiple investigations were normal. He was eventually diagnosed with central hypocortisolism, as evidenced by 8 AM cortisol level of 19 nmol/L (normal, 133-537 nmol/L) and adrenocorticotropic hormone of 7.1 ng/mL (normal, 10.0-60.0 ng/mL). He was started on hydrocortisone, which led to resolution of both dyspepsia and eosinophilia. At the same time, an interesting thyroid function trend was observed—an initial increase in both free thyroxine and thyroid stimulating hormone was followed by temporary central hypothyroidism before subsequent spontaneous recovery. On follow-up 3 weeks later, the patient remained hypocortisolemic. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 may be associated with the delayed onset of central hypocortisolism in its convalescent phase. Although various mechanisms are possible, hypothalamic-pituitary activation during systemic illness, followed by a rebound decrease in activity after recovery, is consistent with the clinical course and thyroid function trend in this patient. It is essential that physicians consider endocrinopathies in the differential diagnosis of such cases, given the risk of life-threatening adrenal crises and their possible contribution to persistent symptoms following recovery from COVID-19.","Chua, Marvin Wei Jie; Chua, Melvin Peng Wei",AACE Clin Case Rep,348,19

MERS-CoV was found to produce severe respiratory illness with case-fatality rates near 50%, and may be transmitted person-to-person in instances of close physical contact, such as among family members and to health care workers. As mice, hamsters, ferrets, and cynomolgus macaques are either not susceptible to MERS-CoV infection or do not develop observable clinical disease, we sought to determine whether rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) can be used as a model of MERS-CoV infection and disease. Animals challenged with MERS-CoV via multiple combined infection routes rapidly developed pneumonia, and we observed other clinical signs of illness, virus shedding, and virus replication in respiratory tissues. Using microarrays to compare transcripts associated with histopathologic lesions removed from the lungs of infected animals, we identified 173 significant differentially expressed genes (DEG) associated with lung lesions on day 3 post-infection concurrent with peak clinical signs. Functional analysis indicated that these genes were predominantly associated with proinflammatory processes, recruitment and chemotaxis of inflammatory cells, and antiviral immunity. Using singular value decomposition coupled multidimensional scaling (SVD-MDS), we also identified changes in similar inflammatory genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, suggesting a rapid activation of innate immune and inflammatory processes in leukocytes after infection. These data were consistent with cytokine and chemokine profiles in the blood of animals. Due to the urgent need for an effective therapeutic means of treating MERS-CoV patients, we used this rhesus macaque model to evaluate post-exposure treatment with combination interferon (IFN)-a2b and ribavirin (RBV), and identified key transcriptional signatures associated with disease severity and treatment efficacy. Animals treated with IFN-a2b/RBV beginning 8h post-infection did not develop significant clinical or severe histopathologic signs of disease, breathing abnormalities, or radiographic evidence of pneumonia, and showed reduced viral loads and lower levels of serum proinflammatory cytokines. Microarray analysis of treated animals showed significant induction of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and fewer upregulated transcripts associated with inflammatory processes. Additionally, we identified a subset of statistically significant DEGs associated with signaling pathways such as hedgehog, which has been linked to airway function and protection against pulmonary injury. Together, these data indicate that treatment of MERS-CoV-infected rhesus macaques with IFN-a2b and ribavirin reduces virus replication and improves clinical outcome, and suggests a transcriptomic basis for therapeutic efficacy. As these two drugs are already used together in the clinic, IFN-a2b and ribavirin may be useful for therapeutic intervention and patient management of new human MERS-CoV cases.","Rasmussen, Angela L.; Falzarano, Darryl; de Wit, Emmie; Feldmann, Friederike; Okumura, Atsushi; Scott, Dana P.; Brining, Douglas; Bushmaker, Trent; Martellaro, Cynthia; Benecke, Arndt G.; Munster, Vincent J.; Feldmann, Heinz; Katze, Michael G.",Cytokine,348,28

However, there are important differences between carbon dioxide (CO(2)), which is a stock pollutant, and methane (CH(4)), which is predominantly a flow pollutant. These dynamics mean that conventional reporting of aggregated CO(2)-equivalent emission rates is highly ambiguous and does not straightforwardly reflect historical or anticipated contributions to global temperature change. As a result, the roles and responsibilities of different sectors emitting different gases are similarly obscured by the common means of communicating emission reduction scenarios using CO(2)-equivalence. We argue for a shift in how we report agricultural greenhouse gas emissions and think about their mitigation to better reflect the distinct roles of different greenhouse gases. Policy-makers, stakeholders, and society at large should also be reminded that the role of agriculture in climate mitigation is a much broader topic than climate science alone can inform, including considerations of economic and technical feasibility, preferences for food supply and land-use, and notions of fairness and justice.

It became the most important public health challenge facing mankind since the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic. Various theoretical and empirical approaches have been designed and used to gain insight into the transmission dynamics and control of the pandemic. This study presents a primer for formulating, analysing and simulating mathematical models for understanding the dynamics of COVID-19. Specifically, we introduce simple compartmental, Kermack-McKendrick-type epidemic models with homogeneously- and heterogeneously-mixed populations, an endemic model for assessing the potential population-level impact of a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine. We illustrate how some basic non-pharmaceutical interventions against COVID-19 can be incorporated into the epidemic model. A brief overview of other kinds of models that have been used to study the dynamics of COVID-19, such as agent-based, network and statistical models, is also presented. Possible extensions of the basic model, as well as open challenges associated with the formulation and theoretical analysis of models for COVID-19 dynamics, are suggested.","Gumel, Abba B.; Iboi, Enahoro A.; Ngonghala, Calistus N.; Elbasha, Elamin H.",Infect Dis Model,348,17

Policymakers have implemented a wide range of non-pharmaceutical interventions to mitigate the spread of the pandemic and reduce burdens on healthcare systems. An efficient response of healthcare systems is crucial to handle a health crisis. Understanding how non-pharmaceutical interventions have contributed to slowing down contagions and how healthcare systems have impacted on fatality associated with health crisis is of utmost importance to learn from the COVID-19 pandemic. We investigated these dynamics in Italy at the regional level. We found that the simultaneous introduction of a variety of measures to increase social distance is associated with an important decrease in the number of new infected patients detected daily. Contagion reduces by 1% with the introduction of lockdowns in an increasing number of regions. We also found that a robust healthcare system is crucial for containing fatality associated with COVID-19. Also, proper diagnosis strategies are determinant to mitigate the severity of the health outcomes.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) data, the spread of the disease appears to be slower in Africa. Although a number of studies have been published on the relationship between meteorological parameters and COVID-19 transmission, the effects of climate conditions on COVID-19 remain largely unexplored and without consensus following the main research finding over Africa (often based on a single country or city). Here, using available epidemiological data over 275 days (i.e., from March 1 to November 30, 2020) taken from the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control of the European Union database and daily data of surface air temperature and humidity from the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), this paper investigates the potential contributions of climate conditions on COVID-19 transmission over 16 countries selected from three bioclimatic regions of Africa (i.e., Sahel, Maghreb and Gulf of Guinea). On average, our main findings highlight statistically significant inverse correlations between COVID-19 cases and temperature over the Maghreb and the Gulf of Guinea regions, whereas positive correlations are found in the Sahel, especially over the central part including Niger and Mali. Correlations with specific humidity and water vapor parameters display significant and positive values over the Sahelian and the Gulf of Guinean countries and negative values over the Maghreb countries. In other word, results imply that the COVID-19 pandemic transmission is influenced differently across the three bioclimatic regions: i) cold and dry environmental conditions over the Maghreb; ii) warm and humid conditions over the Sahel iii) cold and humid conditions over the Gulf of Guinea. These findings could be useful for decision-makers who plan public health and control measures in affected African countries and would have substantial implications for directing respiratory disease surveillance activities.

Little is known about pharmacists' infection IPC activities and their role competence during disease outbreaks. This study aimed to assess pharmacists' perceived role competence to perform frontline roles during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: A cross-sectional survey was conducted using online social media to recruit eligible participants. A validated questionnaire contained 41 items on sociodemographic characteristics, preventative behaviors, and competencies. RESULTS: A total of 486 participants completed the survey. Participants reported several IPC activities that could potentially prevent COVID-19 spread. The majority expressed high attitudes towards their capabilities to fulfill their healthcare roles (M = 4.43, SD = 0.46, out of 5). The vast majority of participants (97.1%) were willing to demonstrate the effective way of cleaning hands and using facemasks. Pharmacists (89.1%) showed their willingness to timely refer patients in response to their emerging needs. Gender, age groups, years of experience, monthly incomes, area of work, ability to make a referral, source of information, and self-isolation discontinuation criteria were significantly associated with pharmacists’ self-perceived role competence. CONCLUSION: Pharmacists are well-positioned as access points to care and can potentially play a significant role in the containment of the COVID-19 outbreak by delivering advanced clinical and public health services. Future research efforts need to be comprehensively directed towards the advanced role of pharmacists in implementing point-of-care testing for infectious diseases.","Muflih, Suhaib; Al-Azzam, Sayer; Lafferty, Lynn; Karasneh, Reema; Soudah, Ola; Khader, Yousef",Ann Med Surg (Lond),348,24

Transport medicine faces unique challenges in the care of persons infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In particular, the multitude of providers, confined spaces for prolonged time periods, varying modes (ground, rotor wing, fixed wing) of transport, and need for frequent aerosol-generating procedures place transport personnel at high risk. This study describes the clinical practices, personal protective equipment, and potential exposure risks of a large cohort of neonatal and pediatric interfacility transport teams. Methods Data for this study came from a survey distributed to members of the American Academy of Pediatrics Section on Transport Medicine. Results Fifty-four teams responded and 47 reported transporting COVID-19 positive patients. Among the 47 teams, 25% indicated having at least one team member convert to COVID-19 positive. A small percentage of teams (40% ground, 40% fixed wing, 18% rotor wing) reported allowing parental accompaniment during transport. There was no difference in teams with a positive team member among those that do (26%) and do not (25%) allow parents. There was a higher percentage of teams with a positive team member among teams that intubate (32% vs 0%) and place LMAs (34% vs 0%) during transport. Conclusions Our study shows that exceptional care during interfacility transport, including a family-centered approach, can continue during the COVID-19 pandemic. Teams must take steps to protect themselves, as well as the patients and families they serve, in order to mitigate transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.","Stroud, Michael H; Miquel-Verges, Franscesca F; Rozenfeld, Ranna A; Holcomb, Robert G; Brown, Clare C; Myer, Keith",Air Med J,348,30

Head-to-head comparisons of such assays using a single set of standard specimens provide additional information about key assay parameters such as sensitivity, specificity and lower limits of detection, and help to inform the decision regarding which method to use. We evaluated two real-time PCR platforms: the Fast-track Diagnostics® (FTD) multiplex respiratory panel and a TaqMan array card (TAC) for simultaneous uniplex detection of multiple respiratory pathogens. Two sets of samples were used to evaluate the assays. One set was created by spiking pooled nasal wash or phosphate buffered saline with specified volumes of known concentrations of virus and/or bacteria. Clinical nasal wash specimens from children with lower respiratory tract illness comprised the other set. Thirteen pathogen targets were compared between the two platforms. Testing with a validation panel of spiked samples revealed a sensitivity of 96.1% and 92.9% for the FTD and TAC assays, respectively. Specificity could not be reliably calculated due to a suspected contamination of the sample substrate. Inter-assay agreement was high (> 95%) for most targets. Previously untested clinical specimens tested by both assays revealed a high percent agreement (> 95%) for all except rhinovirus, enterovirus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Limitations of this evaluation included extraction of the validation samples by two different methods and the evaluation of the assays in different laboratories. However, neither of these factors significantly impacted inter-assay agreement for these sets of samples, and it was demonstrated that both assays could reliably detect clinically relevant concentrations of bacterial and viral pathogens.","Driscoll, Amanda J.; Karron, Ruth A.; Bhat, Niranjan; Thumar, Bhagvanji; Kodani, Maja; Fields, Barry S.; Whitney, Cynthia G.; Levine, Orin S.; O'Brien, Katherine L.; Murdoch, David R.",J Microbiol Methods,348,5

For this reason, efforts to determine changes in laboratory parameters of COVID-19 patients as biomarkers are urgent. Lipids are essential components of the human body, and their modulation has been observed implicated in some viral infections. Methods: To evaluate the clinical diagnosis utility of the lipid profile changes in Mexican COVID-19 patients, the lipid profile of one hundred two COVID-19 positive patients from three hospitals in Culiacan, Sinaloa in northwest Mexico, was analyzed. ROC curves and binary logistic regression analysis were used as a predictive model to determine their clinical diagnostic utility. Results: Significant changes in the serum lipid profile of patients with COVID-19, such as low levels of cholesterol, LDL, and HDL, while high triglycerides and VLDL were observed. The same abnormalities in the lipid profile among non-critical and critical COVID-19 patients were detected. The predictive model analysis suggests that cholesterol and LDL have AUC values of 0.710 and 0.769, respectively, for COVID-19 (p= 0.0002 and p= <0.0001), and LDL low levels might be a risk factor for critical COVID-19 (OR= 2.07, 95% IC: 1.18 to 3.63; p= 0.01). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that low cholesterol and LDL levels could be considered an acceptable predictor for COVID-19, and low levels of LDL might be a risk factor for critical COVID-19 patients.","Osuna-Ramos, J.

Identification of biomarkers to predict severity and prognosis is urgently needed for early medical intervention due to high mortality of critical cases with COVID-19. This retrospective study aimed to indicate the values of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in evaluating the severity and prognosis of COVID-19. Methods: We included 46 death cases from intensive care unit and 68 discharged cases from ordinary units with confirmed COVID-19 of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan Hospital from January 1 to March 22, 2020. Laboratory and radiologic data were analyzed retrospectively. All patients were followed up until April 10, 2020. Results: COVID-19 patients in the death group had significantly higher CEA levels (ng/ml) than discharged group (14.80 ± 14.20 vs. 3.80 ± 2.43, P < 0.001). The risk of COVID-19 death increased 1.317 times for each additional 1 ng/ml CEA level (OR = 1.317, 95% CI: 1.099–1.579). The standardized and weighted receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis adjusted to age, sex, and ferritin levels suggested that the area under the curve (AUC) of the serum CEA levels was 0.808 in discrimination between death cases and discharged cases with COVID-19 (P < 0.001). We found mortality of COVID-19 is associated with elevated CEA levels increased (HR = 1.023, 95% CI: 1.005–1.042), as well as age (HR = 1.050, 95% CI: 1.016–1.086) and ferritin levels (HR = 1.001, 95% CI: 1.001–1.002) by survival analysis of Cox regression model. Among discharged patients, CEA levels were significant lower in moderate cases compared to the severe and critical cases (P = 0.005; OR = 0.488, 95% CI: 0.294–0.808) from binary logistic regression analysis. The AUC of CEA levels was 0.79 in distinguishing moderate cases from discharged COVID-19 patients by standardized and weighted ROC analysis (P < 0.001). A positive correlation between CEA levels and CT scores existed in discharged patients (Correlation Coefficient: 0.687; P < 0.001). Conclusions: Elevated CEA levels increased the risk of death from COVID-19 and CEA levels were related to CT scores of the discharged patients positively.","Chen, Qianqian; Kong, Hui; Qi, Xu; Ding, Wenqiu; Ji, Ningfei; Wu, Chaojie; Huang, Chaolin; Wu, Wenjuan; Huang, Mao; Xie, Weiping; Liu, Yun; Tang, Jinhai",Front Med (Lausanne),348,1

In this Editorial the different aspects of changes in our routine are described, based on the experience of this Editor in Germany. I will try to give you a bit of background information first, as the situation is very much dependent on the specific phase of the pandemic and your place of work. The experience for an Orthopaedic Surgeon in New York or Madrid may differ from that of an Orthopaedic Surgeon in Singapore, or South Korea. As Europe is, at least at the moment, the most affected continent, it hopefully is an interesting topic for all of you. The Covid-19 pandemic is affecting all aspects of our lives, therefore this editorial is divided into 4 sessions: Role as surgeon, as doctor, as teacher, and as family member. Most countries have stopped elective surgeries and by that relegated Orthopaedic surgeons to a minimum of work. Keeping contact to patients with digital tools might be an option to achieve an organised restart after the end of the lock down period and to keep treating patients through that phase. For many Orthopaedic surgeons, the principal task now is being part of an interdisciplinary team that is headed by colleagues from Internal Medicine or Anaesthesiology. Wards from the Orthopaedic department are reorganised as quarantine wards for Covid-19 patients. Worldwide all conferences have been cancelled and nobody knows for how long this will continue. Education now has become fully digital, allowing to present and communicate without real limitations compared to conventional conferences. Some teaching options, such as hands-on workshops, fellowships, etc. are ceased and cannot be replaced by digital options. Due to social distancing families are spending much more time together than before, while some family members, especially the people at risk (elders, ones with a fragile health) cannot be visited for a long time. Get togethers with friends as well as community meetings are completely suspended. For some of them, digital technology is the only option to minimize the problem of social distancing. Overall, it has to be stated, that all parts of our lives as an Orthopaedic Surgeon are affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. As nobody knows how long these restrictions need to remain in place we have to accept them and work on improving this specific situation by following the rules. Hopefully, a vaccine will be developed in the near future, allowing us to return to a “normal” life. Nevertheless, it will never be like it was before.","Graichen, Heiko",J Orthop,348,23

This paper describes an integrative learning process for teaching the “how” of transformation. This process, which we use in our undergraduate courses on climate change and society, combines the “Three Spheres” model of transformation with an active learning change experiment. A pilot assessment, conducted via student surveys and focus groups during spring semester 2020, indicated that the learning process: (1) increased the students’ understanding of transformation and their sense that transformative change is possible; (2) enhanced the students’ sense of their own agency and ability to make a difference; and, (3) helped students to articulate a role for themselves in processes of transformative change. These initial findings suggest that teaching the “how” of transformation is possible and that both understanding and experiential realization of the connection between individual and collective change are vital elements for student learning and engagement. While these early findings need to be replicated in other courses and educational settings, they offer promising indications about how universities and climate change educators can play a more prominent role in generating transformative change.","Leichenko, Robin; Gram-Hanssen, Irmelin; O’Brien, Karen",Sustain Sci,348,16

By reducing in-person contact, it should decrease provider risk of infection and preserve personal protective equipment (PPE). Objectives To describe and assess the early results of a novel telehealth workflow in which remote providers collaborate with in-person nursing to evaluate and discharge well-appearing, low-risk ED patients with suspected COVID-19 infection. Methods Retrospective chart review was completed three weeks after implementation. Metrics include the number of patients evaluated, number of patients discharged without in-person contact, telehealth wait time and duration, collection of testing, ED length of stay (ED-LOS), 72-hour return, number of in-person healthcare provider contacts, and associated PPE use. Results Among 302 patients evaluated by telehealth, 153 patients were evaluated and discharged by a telehealth provider with reductions in ED-LOS, PPE use, and close contact with healthcare personnel. These patients had a 62.5% shorter ED-LOS compared to other ESI Level 4 patients seen over the same time period. Telehealth use for these 153 patients saved 413 sets of PPE. We observed a 3.9% 72-hour revisit rate. One patient discharged after telehealth evaluation was hospitalized on a return visit 9 days later. Conclusion Telehealth can be safely and efficiently used to evaluate, treat, test, and discharge ED patients suspected to have COVID-19. This workflow reduces infection risks to healthcare providers, PPE use, and ED-LOS. Additionally, it allows quarantined but otherwise well clinicians to continue working.","Carlberg, David J.; Bhat, Rahul; Zaatari, Saad; Patterson, William O.; Kolkin, Alexander; Chandra, Vinodh; Ratwani, Raj M.; Wilson, Matthew D.; Ladkany, Diana; Adams, Katharine T.; Jackson, Mary; Lysen-Hendershot, Kristi; Booker, Ethan A.",J Emerg Med,348,26

In order to prevent the epidemic, traffic lockdown was required in many areas of China, which led to inconvenience of treatment for dialysis patients. This study was conducted to explore the psychological distress and the psychological demand induced by CO­VID-19 in the patients undergoing dialysis and compare the difference between hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients during the traffic lockdown period. METHODS: Questionnaires were given to the dialysis patients in the West China Hospital of Sichuan University. The Impact of Event Scale (IES) was used to investigate the patients' trauma-related distress in response to COVID-19. RESULTS: 232 eligible respondents were enrolled in this cross-section study, consisting of 156 PD patients and 76 HD patients. The median IES score for all the enrolled patients was 8.00 (2.00–19.00), which belonged to the subclinical dimension of post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). HD patients had a significant higher IES score than PD patients (11.50 vs. 8.00) (p < 0.05). HD patients already got more psychological support from the medical staff. According to IES scores, 22.4% HD patients and 13.4% PD patients were classified as having moderate or severe PTSS, which need psychological support (p < 0.05). But more patients of both groups considered psychological support was necessary (HD: 50%, PD: 45.5%) (p > 0.05). In the multivariate regression analysis, we found that dialysis vintage, the impact of COVID-19 on the severity of illness and daily life, and confidence in overcoming the disease contributed to IES score (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: HD patients had more severe trauma-related stress symptoms than PD patients. When major public healthy events occurred, careful psychological estimate and sufficient psychological support should be provided to the dialysis patients, especially to the HD patients.","Xia, Xiaoxiao; Wu, Xiaofang; Zhou, Xueli; Zang, Zhiyun; Pu, Li; Li, Zi",Blood Purif,348,1

While individually oriented techniques benefit many, they can also disadvantage populations struggling the most. They exact a cost by placing a higher burden on those with fewer resources and thus risk widening structural inequities. Since community‐level interventions can also enhance resiliency and are cheaper and more sustainable, more effort should be put into developing and deploying them. At a time in which hardship is widespread, parents are overwhelmed by multiple demands, structural inequities are rampant, and demand for services outpaces capacity, the mental health field must prioritize more equitable methods of assisting large numbers of children and families.","Zilberstein, Karen",Child Adolesc Ment Health,348,13

The application of antiviral drugs provides an immediate and direct control of influenza virus infection. At present, the major strategy for managing patients with influenza is through targeting conserved viral proteins critical for viral replication. Two classes of conventional antiviral drugs, the M2 ion channel blockers and the neuraminidase inhibitors, are frequently used. In recent years, increasing levels of resistance to both drug classes has become a major public health concern, highlighting the urgent need for the development of alternative treatments. Novel classes of antiviral compounds or biomolecules targeting viral replication mechanism are under development, using approaches including high-throughput small-molecule screening platforms and structure-based designs. In response to influenza virus infection, host cellular mechanisms are triggered to defend against the invaders. At the same time, viruses as obligate intracellular pathogens have evolved to exploit cellular responses in support of their efficient replication, including antagonizing the host type I interferon response as well as activation of specific cellular pathways at different stages of the replication cycle. Numerous studies have highlighted the possibility of targeting virus–host interactions and host cellular mechanisms to develop new treatment regimens. This review aims to give an overview of current and novel concepts targeting the virus and the host for managing influenza.","Lee, Suki Man-Yan; Yen, Hui-Ling",Antiviral Res,348,3

The COVID-19 pandemic has generated a deep economic crisis, exacerbating worldwide feelings of uncertainty and precarity. Individuals with insecure jobs have (and will) probably suffered the most from this situation. Workers with higher job insecurity have poorer psychological and physical health, display more negative work attitudes and are less satisfied about their life. However, much less is known about the impact of job insecurity and life uncertainty on consumer behavior. Using the Conservation of Resources theory as a framework, the present study examines a model in which job insecurity and life uncertainty would have a negative effect on everyday consumptions and broader life projects of individuals. Data collection was conducted in Italy in June and July 2020 during COVID-19 pandemic, in the immediate aftermath of the national lockdown. In a sample of 830 workers, the results of a mediation analysis showed that job insecurity and life uncertainty had a detrimental impact of consumer behaviors, since they were significantly associated with higher propensity to sacrifice and reduce everyday short-term consumptions (e.g., buying food) and greater perceived unaffordability of broader long-term life projects (e.g., buying a house).","Chirumbolo, Antonio; Callea, Antonino; Urbini, Flavio",Int J Environ Res Public Health,348,22

RESULTS: In the DNA sequence isolated from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) in Iran, a coding sequence for the RNA binding domain of N protein was detected. The comparison of Chinese and Iranian DNA sequences displayed that a thymine (T) was mutated to cytosine (C), so “TTG” from China was changed to “CTG” in Iran. Both DNA sequences from Iran and China have been encoded for leucine. In addition, the second T in “CTG” in the DNA or uracil (U) in “CUG” in the RNA sequences from Iran can be mutated to another C by a missense mutation resulting from thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) of human and base excision repair mechanism to produce “CCG” encoding for proline, which consequently may increase the affinity of the RNA binding domain of N protein to viral RNA and improve the transcription rate, pathogenicity, evasion from human immunity system, spreading in the human body, and risk of human-to-human transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2.","Zolfaghari Emameh, Reza; Eftekhari, Mahyar; Nosrati, Hassan; Heshmatnia, Jalal; Falak, Reza",BMC Res Notes,348,26

Similar to other coronaviruses, its particles are composed of four structural proteins: spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. S, E, and M proteins are glycosylated, and the N protein is phosphorylated. The S protein is involved in the interaction with the host receptor human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), which is also heavily glycosylated. Recent studies have revealed several other potential host receptors or factors that can increase or modulate the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Interestingly, most of these molecules bear carbohydrate residues. While glycans acquired by the viruses through the hijacking of the host machinery help the viruses in their infectivity, they also play roles in immune evasion or modulation. Glycans play complex roles in viral pathobiology, both on their own and in association with carrier biomolecules, such as proteins or glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Understanding these roles in detail can help in developing suitable strategies for prevention and therapy of COVID-19. In this review, we sought to emphasize the interplay of SARS-CoV-2 glycosylated proteins and their host receptors in viral attachment, entry, replication, and infection. Moreover, the implications for future therapeutic interventions targeting these glycosylated biomolecules are also discussed in detail.

The knowledge base to inform recommendations for optimization of VMA is lacking. We therefore conducted a comprehensive evaluation of EU VMA pathways. METHODS Research in two phases included: (1) mapping VMA pathways in each EU member state (including the UK) based on a literature review, expert interviews, and mathematical archetyping; and (2) interviews with vaccine experts to identify barriers, drivers, and recommendations for regional VMA alignments. RESULTS Key steps in VMA across the EU include horizon scanning, early advice, National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (NITAG) recommendation for inclusion in national immunization programs, health technology assessment (HTA), final decision and procurement. We found significant complexity and heterogeneity, particularly for early advice, and in the roles, decision-making criteria, and transparency of NITAGs and HTA bodies. The most important drivers for rapid VMA included demonstration of disease burden and vaccine benefit (e.g., efficacy, safety, economic). Key barriers were budget limitations and complexity/clarity of VMA processes (e.g., need for national-regional consensus, clarity on process initiation, and clarity on the role of HTA). Recommendations for alignment at EU and member-state levels include information sharing, joint clinical assessment, initiatives to address funding and political barriers, and improved transparency by decision-making bodies. Early engagement with vaccine stakeholders was a key recommendation for manufacturers. CONCLUSIONS There is significant potential for alignment, collaboration, and improvement of VMA across the EU. Roles, responsibilities, and transparency of key bodies can be clarified. The COVID-19 pandemic response should stimulate policies to improve access to all vaccines, including routine ones, and form the foundation upon which a consistent vaccine ecosystem can be created for the EU, one that is resilient, consistent between member states, and fit for purpose.","Laigle, Valérie; Postma, Maarten J; Pavlovic, Mira; Cadeddu, Chiara; Beck, Ekkehard; Kapusniak, Anna; Toumi, Mondher",Vaccine,348,20

Therefore, ensuring that medical schools provide adequate education in TM is important. The aim of this study was to assess the status of TM education at a global level. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A comprehensive anonymous survey to assess TM education in existing medical school curricula was developed. The survey was distributed to deans and educational leads of medical schools in a range of low‐, medium‐, high‐, and very high–human development index (HDI) countries. It included 20 questions designed to assess specific domains including structure of TM curriculum and teaching faculty. RESULTS: The response rate was 53%. The majority of responding schools from very‐high–HDI countries offered a 6‐year curriculum after high school or a 4‐year curriculum after college education, whereas most schools from medium‐HDI countries offered a 5‐year medical curriculum. A formal teaching program was available in only 42% of these schools in contrast to 94% of medical schools from very high‐HDI. Overall, 25% of all medical schools did not offer structured TM teaching. When offered, most TM teaching was mandatory (95%) and integrated within the third and fourth year of medical school. Formal assessment of TM knowledge was done in 72% of all responding medical schools. More than half of the deans considered the TM education in their medical schools as inadequate.

Given uncertainties around the severity of upcoming RSV bronchiolitis epidemics, debate exists whether Palivizumab (RSV prophylaxis) should be administered to infants with Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH), who may be vulnerable due to lung hypoplasia and pulmonary hypertension. AIM: To evaluate (1) if CDH infants have higher risk of admission with RSV bronchiolitis than infants in the general population; (2) if Palivizumab prophylaxis may reduce this risk. METHODS: We included all eligible studies examining the risk(s) of RSV-positive bronchiolitis requiring hospital admission in (1) CDH infants without Palivizumab prophylaxis vs infants in the general population and (2) CDH infants with prophylaxis vs CDH infants without prophylaxis. The primary outcome evaluated was the risk of admission with RSV bronchiolitis. Data are reported descriptively and meta-analysed when appropriate. RESULTS: Three eligible retrospective cohort studies were identified: One study found CDH to be an independent risk factor for RSV hospitalisation (Odds ratio 3.30, 95% confidence interval 2.01-4.4); two studies compared RSV hospitalisation rates in CDH patients who had Palivizumab vs those that did not. The pooled Risk Ratio was 1.11 (95% CI 0.29-4.23, p=0.88). Overall, the quality of evidence was considered poor and one study was industry funded. CONCLUSION: Whether CDH infants are at particular risk of severe bronchiolitis remains unclear. There is no evidence from this current systematic review that CDH infants should routinely receive Palivizumab vaccination prophylaxis. This article is protected by copyright.

However, animal disease surveillance and diagnosis in LMICs is often challenging, and turnaround times between sample submission and diagnosis can take days to weeks. This diagnostic gap and subsequent disease under‐reporting can allow emerging and transboundary animal pathogens to spread, with potentially serious and far‐reaching consequences. Point‐of‐care tests (POCTs), which allow for rapid diagnosis of infectious diseases in non‐laboratory settings, have the potential to significantly disrupt traditional animal health surveillance paradigms in LMICs. This literature review sought to identify POCTs currently available for diagnosing infectious animal diseases and to determine facilitators and barriers to their use and uptake in LMICs. Results indicated that some veterinary POCTs have been used for field‐based animal disease diagnosis in LMICs with good results. However, many POCTs target a small number of key agricultural and zoonotic animal diseases, while few exist for other important animal diseases. POCT evaluation is rarely taken beyond the laboratory and into the field where they are predicted to have the greatest impact, and where conditions can greatly affect test performance. A lack of mandated test validation regulations for veterinary POCTs has allowed tests of varying quality to enter the market, presenting challenges for potential customers. The use of substandard, improperly validated or unsuitable POCTs in LMICs can greatly undermine their true potential and can have far‐reaching negative impacts on disease control. To successfully implement novel rapid diagnostic pathways for animal disease in LMICs, technical, regulatory, socio‐political and economic challenges must be overcome, and further research is urgently needed before the potential of animal disease POCTs can be fully realized.","Hobbs, Emma C.; Colling, Axel; Gurung, Ratna B.; Allen, John",Transbound Emerg Dis,348,1

ADE is considered to be a significant obstacle to developing effective vaccines for many viruses for which ADE has been reported, since virus-specific antibodies of maternal origin or those conferred by vaccination can facilitate the entry of the virus into target cells, sometimes resulting in increased severity of the disease. In this study, the role of specific PRRS viral epitopes in ADE and/or virus neutralization (VN) was assessed in vitro using 14 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to 4 PRRS viral proteins: nucleocapsid (N), matrix (M), glycoprotein (GP) 5, and GP3. Each mAb recongnized a distinct epitope on one of these proteins. One-way ADE and VN assays were performed in vitro using homologous PRRS virus isolates in the presence or absence of each mAb. ADE activity was determined by detecting a significant increase of progeny virus yield in porcine alveolar macrophage cultures in the presence of individual mAbs. Neutralizing activity was determined by detecting a significant reduction or complete blocking of virus replication in MARC-145 cells in the presence of individual mAbs. mAbs could be categorized into 3 groups: enhancing, neutralizing and neither. Viral epitopes which are capable of inducing neutralizing antibodies appeared to reside on the M, GP3 and GP5 proteins, while epitopes that may induce ADE-mediating antibody were associated with the N and GP5 proteins. Identification of the viral proteins and antigens and epitopes responsible for ADE- and VN-mediating antibodies may provide the basis for developing efficacious second-generation vaccines for the control of PRRS virus; yet, further epitope mapping remains to be done.","Cancel-Tirado, Sol M.; Evans, Richard B.; Yoon, Kyoung-Jin",Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology,348,9

If pyrolyzing bio-wastes into biochar could minimize such risks had not been elucidated. This study evaluated PTE pools, microbial and ARGs abundances of wheat straw (WS), swine manure (SM) and sewage sludge (SS) before and after pyrolysis, which were again tested for soil amendment at a 2% dosage in a pot experiment with a vegetable crop of pak choi (Brassica campestris L.). Pyrolysis led to PTEs concentration in biochars but reduced greatly their mobility, availability and migration potential, as revealed respectively by leaching, CaCl(2) extraction and risk assessment coding. In SM and SS after pyrolysis, gene abundance was removed by 4 to 5 orders for bacterial, by 2-3 orders for fungi and by 3-5 orders for total ARGs. With these material amended, PTEs available pool decreased by 25% to 85% while all ARGs eliminated to background in the pot soil. Unlike a >50% yield decrease and a >30% quality decline with unpyrolyzed SM and SS, their biochars significantly (p>0.05) increased biomass production and overall quality of pak choi grown in the amended soil. Comparatively, amendment of the biochars decreased plant PTEs content by 23-57% and greatly reduced health risk of pak choi, with total target hazard quotient values well below the guideline limit for subsistence diet by adult. Furthermore, biochar soil amendment enabled a synergic improvement on soil fertility, product quality, and biomass production as well as metal stabilization in the soil-plant system. Thus, biowastes pyrolysis and reuse in vegetable production could help build up a closed loop of production-waste-biochar-production, addressing not only circular economy but healthy food and climate nexus also and contributing to achieving the United Nations sustainable development goals.","Zhi, Lin; Zhipeng, Rui; Minglong, Liu; Rongjun, Bian; Xiaoyu, Liu; Haifei, Lu; Kun, Cheng; Xuhui, Zhang; Jufeng, Zheng; Lianqing, Li; Marios, Drosos; Stephen, Joseph; Natarjan, Ishwaran; Genxing, Pan",J Clean Prod,348,20

Currently, more than 80,000 cases have been diagnosed in China, including more than 3,000 deaths. The epidemic is spreading to the rest of the world, posing a grave challenge to prevention and control. On February 12, 2020, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses and the World Health Organization officially named the novel coronavirus and associated pneumonia as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), respectively. According to the recent research on SARS-CoV-2, the virus mainly infects the respiratory system but may cause damage to other systems. In this paper, we will systematically review the pathogenic features, transmission routes, and infection mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2, as well as any adverse effects on the digestive system, urogenital system, central nervous system, and circulatory system, in order to provide a theoretical and clinical basis for the diagnosis, classification, treatment, and prognosis assessment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Zhang, Yuhao; Geng, Xiuchao; Tan, Yanli; Li, Qiang; Xu, Can; Xu, Jianglong; Hao, Liangchao; Zeng, Zhaomu; Luo, Xianpu; Liu, Fulin; Wang, Hong",Biomed Pharmacother,348,1

We hypothesized that surgical stabilization of rib fractures would not decrease the incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome. METHODS: The National Trauma Data Bank was queried for all traumatic rib fractures in 2016. Patients were divided into groups with single rib fractures, multiple rib fractures, and flail chest. Nonoperative therapy was compared with stabilization of rib fractures of 1 to 2 ribs or 3+ ribs. RESULTS: There were 114,972 total patients with rib fractures meeting inclusion criteria, with 5,106 (4.4%) having flail chest, 24,726 (21.5%) having single rib fractures, and 85,140 (74.1%) having multiple rib fractures. Those with flail chest (15.9%) were most likely to get rib plating in comparison to multiple rib fractures (0.9%) and single rib fractures (0.2%); P < .001. On logistic regression, surgical stabilization of rib fractures 1 to 2 ribs (odds ratio: 0.17, 95% confidence interval: 0.10–0.28) or 3+ ribs (odds ratio: 0.17, 95% confidence interval: 0.11–0.28), with nonoperative therapy as the reference was associated with survival. Variables associated with mortality included increasing age, male sex, increasing injury severity score, decreased Glasgow coma scale, requirement of transfusions, and hypotension on admission. Surgical stabilization of rib fractures 3+ ribs (odds ratio: 2.30, 95% confidence interval: 1.58–3.37) was associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome but not 1 to 2 ribs (odd ratio: 1.55, 95% confidence interval: 0.97–2.48). On logistic regression of only patients with flail chest, stabilization of rib fractures was associated with decreased mortality but not increased risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome. CONCLUSION: The increased risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome should be considered in the preoperative assessment for stabilization of rib fractures.","Taghavi, Sharven; Ali, Ayman; Green, Erik; Schmitt, Kyle; Jackson-Weaver, Olan; Tatum, Danielle; Harris, Charles; Guidry, Chrissy; McGrew, Patrick; Schroll, Rebecca; Kolls, Jay; Duchesne, Juan",Surgery,348,30

Data shows that, among these measures, the lockdown implemented as of 9 March had a positive impact, in particular the central and southern regions of Italy, while other actions appeared to be less effective. When the true prevalence of a disease is unknown, it is possible estimate it, based on mortality data and the assumptive case-fatality rate of the disease. Given these assumptions, the estimated period-prevalence of COVID-19 in Italy varies from 0.35% in Sicily to 13.3% in Lombardy.","Signorelli, Carlo; Scognamiglio, Thea; Odone, Anna",Acta Biomed,348,4
