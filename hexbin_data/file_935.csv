180906,Changes in life history and population size can explain relative neutral diversity levels on X and autosomes in extant human populations,2019-09-09,"Abstract Background and Aims The New South Wales (NSW) COVID-19 outbreak is at 478 daily cases on August 16, 2021. Our aims were to: 1) estimate the time required to reach [≤]5 cases per day under three lockdown strengths (weak, moderate, strong), and four vaccination rollouts: (a) per the original plan, (b) prioritizing essential workers, (c) b plus rapid vaccination of 25% of <60-year-olds with AstraZeneca (AZ25), and (d) b plus rapid vaccination of 50% of <60-year-olds with AstraZeneca (AZ50). 2) estimate the number of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in the 100 days after 1/August for the 12 scenarios. Methods An agent-based model was adapted to NSW and the Delta variant. Hospitalization and mortality rates for unvaccinated COVID-19 infections were doubled given the virulence of Delta. Results The business-as-usual rollout fully vaccinates 50%, 70% and 80% of >16-year-olds by 10/Oct, 21/Nov, and 28/Dec, respectively. This reduced to 1/Oct, 30/Oct, and 22/Nov for the fastest (AZ50) rollout. A strong lockdown with a rapid vaccine rollout was the fastest to reach [≤]5 cases (14-day average), with a median of 78 days (90% Uncertainty interval 61 - 103) or 18/Oct, compared to 207 days (166 - 254) or 24/Feb for a weak lockdown with no rollout acceleration. Increased lockdown strength had more impact than rollout acceleration. Under the AZ25 vaccination scenario, there were 1,440 (90% UI 262 - 10,600 deaths in the first 100 days of cases under a weak lockdown, compared to 71 (90% UI 26 - 178) under a strong lockdown scenario. Conclusion NSW will likely achieve 70% vaccination of >16-year-olds before reaching [≤]5 daily cases. Accelerating the vaccine rollout is important for the medium-term, but in the short-term increased restriction strength was more effective at reducing caseload (and subsequently mortality and hospitalisation) than accelerating the vaccine rollout.","Bablani, L.; Wilson, T.; Andrabi, H.; Sundararajan, V.; Ait Oukarim, D.; Abraham, P.; Thompson, J.; Blakely, T.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.18.21262252v1?rss=1,935
185862,The gene encoding the nucleocapsid protein of Gill-associated nidovirus of Penaeus monodon prawns is located upstream of the glycoprotein gene.,2004,"Peripheral sensory neurons located in dorsal root ganglia relay sensory information from the peripheral tissue to the brain. Satellite glial cells (SGC) are unique glial cells that form an envelope completely surrounding each sensory neuron soma. This organization allows for close bi-directional communication between the neuron and it surrounding glial coat. Morphological and molecular changes in SGC have been observed in multiple pathological conditions such as inflammation, chemotherapy-induced neuropathy, viral infection and nerve injuries. There is evidence that changes in SGC contribute to chronic pain by augmenting neuronal activity in various rodent pain models. SGC also play a critical role in axon regeneration. Whether findings made in rodent model systems are relevant to human physiology have not been investigated. Here we present a detailed characterization of the transcriptional profile of SGC in mouse, rat and human at the single cell level. Our findings suggest that key features of SGC in rodent models are conserved in human. Our study provides the potential to leverage on rodent SGC properties and identify potential targets for the treatment of nerve repair and alleviation of painful conditions.","Avraham, Oshri; Chamessian, Alexander; Feng, Rui; Halevi, Alexandra E.; Moore, Amy M.; Gereau, Robert W.; Cavalli, Valeria",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.17.440274,935
