We investigated levels of copeptin, the C-terminal segment of the vasopressin prohormone, that mirrors the production rate of vasopressin in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: We measured levels of copeptin on admission and after days 3/4, 5/6, and 7/8 in 74 consecutive hospitalized adult COVID-19 patients and compared its prognostic accuracy to that of patients with community-acquired pneumonia (n = 876) and acute or chronic bronchitis (n = 371) from a previous study by means of logistic regression analysis. The primary endpoint was all-cause 30-day mortality. RESULTS: Median admission copeptin levels in COVID-19 patients were almost 4-fold higher in nonsurvivors compared with survivors (49.4 pmol/L [iterquartile range (IQR) 24.9-68.9 pmol/L] vs 13.5 pmol/L [IQR 7.0-26.7 pmol/L]), resulting in an age- and gender-adjusted odds ratio of 7.0 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-40.3), p &lt; 0.03 for mortality. Higher copeptin levels in nonsurvivors persisted during the short-term follow-up. Compared with the control group patients with acute/chronic bronchitis and pneumonia, COVID-19 patients did not have higher admission copeptin levels. CONCLUSIONS: A pronounced activation of the vasopressin system in COVID-19 patients is associated with an adverse clinical course in COVID-19 patients. This finding, however, is not unique to COVID-19 but similar to other types of respiratory infections.","Gregoriano, C.; Molitor, A.; Haag, E.; Kutz, A.; Koch, D.; Haubitz, S.; Conen, A.; Bernasconi, L.; Hammerer-Lercher, A.; Fux, C.
