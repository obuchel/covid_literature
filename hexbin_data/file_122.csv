248,248,248,A Statistical Framework for the Adaptive Management of Epidemiological Interventions,14.262273,4.8375363,2009-06-05,"BACKGROUND: Epidemiological interventions aim to control the spread of infectious disease through various mechanisms, each carrying a different associated cost. METHODOLOGY: We describe a flexible statistical framework for generating optimal epidemiological interventions that are designed to minimize the total expected cost of an emerging epidemic while simultaneously propagating uncertainty regarding the underlying disease model parameters through to the decision process. The strategies produced through this framework are adaptive: vaccination schedules are iteratively adjusted to reflect the anticipated trajectory of the epidemic given the current population state and updated parameter estimates. CONCLUSIONS: Using simulation studies based on a classic influenza outbreak, we demonstrate the advantages of adaptive interventions over non-adaptive ones, in terms of cost and resource efficiency, and robustness to model misspecification.","Merl, Daniel; Johnson, Leah R.; Gramacy, Robert B.; Mangel, Marc",PLoS One,122,1

494,494,494,Travel Patterns in China,14.309355,4.838309,2011-02-02,"The spread of infectious disease epidemics is mediated by human travel. Yet human mobility patterns vary substantially between countries and regions. Quantifying the frequency of travel and length of journeys in well-defined population is therefore critical for predicting the likely speed and pattern of spread of emerging infectious diseases, such as a new influenza pandemic. Here we present the results of a large population survey undertaken in 2007 in two areas of China: Shenzhen city in Guangdong province, and Huangshan city in Anhui province. In each area, 10,000 randomly selected individuals were interviewed, and data on regular and occasional journeys collected. Travel behaviour was examined as a function of age, sex, economic status and home location. Women and children were generally found to travel shorter distances than men. Travel patterns in the economically developed Shenzhen region are shown to resemble those in developed and economically advanced middle income countries with a significant fraction of the population commuting over distances in excess of 50 km. Conversely, in the less developed rural region of Anhui, travel was much more local, with very few journeys over 30 km. Travel patterns in both populations were well-fitted by a gravity model with a lognormal kernel function. The results provide the first quantitative information on human travel patterns in modern China, and suggest that a pandemic emerging in a less developed area of rural China might spread geographically sufficiently slowly for containment to be feasible, while spatial spread in the more economically developed areas might be expected to be much more rapid, making containment more difficult.","Garske, Tini; Yu, Hongjie; Peng, Zhibin; Ye, Min; Zhou, Hang; Cheng, Xiaowen; Wu, Jiabing; Ferguson, Neil",PLoS One,122,1
511,511,511,Nursing heroism in the 21(st )Century',14.378039,4.7488055,2011-02-16,"BACKGROUND: The Vivian Bullwinkel Oration honours the life and work of an extraordinary nurse. Given her story and that of her World War II colleagues, the topic of nursing heroism in the 21(st )century could not be more germane. DISCUSSION: Is heroism a legitimate part of nursing, or are nurses simply 'just doing their job' even when facing extreme personal danger? In this paper I explore the place and relevance of heroism in contemporary nursing. I propose that nursing heroism deserves a broader appreciation and that within the term lie many hidden, 'unsung' or 'unrecorded' heroisms. I also challenge the critiques of heroism that would condemn it as part of a 'militarisation' of nursing. Finally, I argue that nursing needs to be more open in celebrating our heroes and the transformative power of nursing achievements. SUMMARY: The language of heroism may sound quaint by 21(st )Century standards but nursing heroism is alive and well in the best of our contemporary nursing ethos and practice.","Darbyshire, Philip",BMC Nurs,122,1
1075,1075,1075,Enhancing Bioaerosol Sampling by Andersen Impactors Using Mineral-Oil-Spread Agar Plate,14.404413,5.096416,2013-02-27,"As a bioaerosol sampling standard, Andersen type impactor is widely used since its invention in 1950s, including the investigation of the anthrax attacks in the United States in 2001. However, its related problems such as impaction and desiccation stress as well as particle bounce have not been solved. Here, we improved its biological collection efficiencies by plating a mineral oil layer (100 µL) onto the agar plate. An Andersen six-stage sampler and a BioStage impactor were tested with mineral-oil-spread agar plates in collecting indoor and outdoor bacterial and fungal aerosols. The effects of sampling times (5, 10 and 20 min) were also studied using the BioStage impactor when sampling environmental bioaerosols as well as aerosolized Bacillus subtilis (G+) and Escherichia coli (G-). In addition, particle bounce reduction by mineral-oil-plate was also investigated using an optical particle counter (OPC). Experimental results revealed that use of mineral-oil-spread agar plate can substantially enhance culturable bioaerosol recoveries by Andersen type impactors (p-values<0.05). The recovery enhancement was shown to depend on bioaerosol size, type, sampling time and environment. In general, more enhancements (extra 20%) were observed for last stage of the Andersen six-stage samplers compared to the BioStage impactor for 10 min sampling. When sampling aerosolized B. subtilis, E. coli and environmental aerosols, the enhancement was shown to increase with increasing sampling time, ranging from 50% increase at 5 min to ∼100% at 20 min. OPC results indicated that use of mineral oil can effectively reduce the particle bounce with an average of 66% for 10 min sampling. Our work suggests that enhancements for fungal aerosols were primarily attributed to the reduced impaction stress, while for bacterial aerosols reduced impaction, desiccation and particle bounce played major roles. The developed technology can readily enhance the agar-based techniques including those high volume portable samplers for bioaerosol monitoring.","Xu, Zhenqiang; Wei, Kai; Wu, Yan; Shen, Fangxia; Chen, Qi; Li, Mingzhen; Yao, Maosheng",PLoS One,122,1
2068,2068,2068,A simple novel device for air sampling by electrokinetic capture,14.526724,5.145865,2015-12-27,"BACKGROUND: A variety of different sampling devices are currently available to acquire air samples for the study of the microbiome of the air. All have a degree of technical complexity that limits deployment. Here, we evaluate the use of a novel device, which has no technical complexity and is easily deployable. RESULTS: An air-cleaning device powered by electrokinetic propulsion has been adapted to provide a universal method for collecting samples of the aerobiome. Plasma-induced charge in aerosol particles causes propulsion to and capture on a counter-electrode. The flow of ions creates net bulk airflow, with no moving parts. A device and electrode assembly have been re-designed from air-cleaning technology to provide an average air flow of 120 lpm. This compares favorably with current air sampling devices based on physical air pumping. Capture efficiency was determined by comparison with a 0.4 μm polycarbonate reference filter, using fluorescent latex particles in a controlled environment chamber. Performance was compared with the same reference filter method in field studies in three different environments. For 23 common fungal species by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), there was 100 % sensitivity and apparent specificity of 87 %, with the reference filter taken as “gold standard.” Further, bacterial analysis of 16S RNA by amplicon sequencing showed equivalent community structure captured by the electrokinetic device and the reference filter. Unlike other current air sampling methods, capture of particles is determined by charge and so is not controlled by particle mass. We analyzed particle sizes captured from air, without regard to specific analyte by atomic force microscopy: particles at least as low as 100 nM could be captured from ambient air. CONCLUSIONS: This work introduces a very simple plug-and-play device that can sample air at a high-volume flow rate with no moving parts and collect particles down to the sub-micron range. The performance of the device is substantially equivalent to capture by pumping through a filter for microbiome analysis by quantitative PCR and amplicon sequencing.","Gordon, Julian; Gandhi, Prasanthi; Shekhawat, Gajendra; Frazier, Angel; Hampton-Marcell, Jarrad; Gilbert, Jack A.",Microbiome,122,1

Exposure science provides a key connection between changes in climate and associated health outcomes. The theme of the 2015 Annual Meeting of the International Society of Exposure Science—Exposures in an Evolving Environment—brought this issue to the fore. By directing attention to questions that may affect society in profound ways, exposure scientists have an opportunity to conduct “consequential science”—doing science that matters, using our tools for the greater good and to answer key policy questions, and identifying causes leading to implementation of solutions. Understanding the implications of changing exposures on public health may be one of the most consequential areas of study in which exposure scientists could currently be engaged. In this paper, we use a series of case studies to identify exposure data gaps and research paths that will enable us to capture the information necessary for understanding climate change-related human exposures and consequent health impacts. We hope that paper will focus attention on under-developed areas of exposure science that will likely have broad implications for public health.","LaKind, Judy S; Overpeck, Jonathan; Breysse, Patrick N; Backer, Lorrie; Richardson, Susan D; Sobus, Jon; Sapkota, Amir; Upperman, Crystal R; Jiang, Chengsheng; Beard, C Ben; Brunkard, J M; Bell, Jesse E; Harris, Ryan; Chretien, Jean-Paul; Peltier, Richard E; Chew, Ginger L; Blount, Benjamin C",J Expo Sci Environ Epidemiol,122,7
2784,2784,2784,Are disease reservoirs special? Taxonomic and life history characteristics,14.557355,5.0609694,2017-07-13,"Pathogens that spill over between species cause a significant human and animal health burden. Here, we describe characteristics of animal reservoirs that are required for pathogen spillover. We assembled and analyzed a database of 330 disease systems in which a pathogen spills over from a reservoir of one or more species. Three-quarters of reservoirs included wildlife, and 84% included mammals. Further, 65% of pathogens depended on a community of reservoir hosts, rather than a single species, for persistence. Among mammals, the most frequently identified reservoir hosts were rodents, artiodactyls, and carnivores. The distribution among orders of mammalian species identified as reservoirs did not differ from that expected by chance. Among disease systems with high priority pathogens and epidemic potential, we found birds, primates, and bats to be overrepresented. We also analyzed the life history traits of mammalian reservoir hosts and compared them to mammals as a whole. Reservoir species had faster life history characteristics than mammals overall, exhibiting traits associated with greater reproductive output rather than long-term survival. Thus, we find that in many respects, reservoirs of spillover pathogens are indeed special. The described patterns provide a useful resource for studying and managing emerging infectious diseases.","Plourde, Benjamin T.; Burgess, Tristan L.; Eskew, Evan A.; Roth, Tara M.; Stephenson, Nicole; Foley, Janet E.",PLoS One,122,17

To effectively study camel traits, a biobank of camel DNA specimens with associated biological information is needed. We examined whole-blood, saliva (buccal swabs), and tail-hair follicle samples to determine which is the best source for establishing a DNA biobank. We inspected five amounts of each of whole-blood, buccal swabs, and tail-hair follicles in nine camels, both qualitatively via gel electrophoresis and quantitatively using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. We also tested the effects of long term-storage on the quality and quantity of DNA, and measured the rate of degradation, by analyzing three buccal swab samples and 30 tail-hair follicles over a period of nine months. Good quality DNA, in the form of visible large size DNA bands, was extracted from all three sources, for all five amounts. The five volumes of whole-blood samples (20–100μl) provided ~0.4–3.6 μg, the five quantities of buccal swabs (1–5) produced ~0.1–12 μg, while the five amounts of tail-hair follicles (10–50) resulted in ~0.7–25 μg. No differences in the rate of degradation of buccal swab and tail-hair follicle DNA were detected, but there was clearly greater deterioration in the quality of DNA extracted from buccal swabs when compared to tail-hair follicles. We recommend using tail-hair samples for camel DNA biobanking, because it resulted in both an adequate quality and quantity of DNA, along with its ease of collection, transportation, and storage. Compared to its success in studies of other domesticated animals, we anticipate that using ~50 tail-hair follicles will provide sufficient DNA for sequencing or SNP genotyping.","Alhaddad, Hasan; Maraqa, Tasneem; Alabdulghafour, Suha; Alaskar, Huda; Alaqeely, Randa; Almathen, Faisal; Alhajeri, Bader H.",PLoS One,122,1
3639,3639,3639,Estimation in emerging epidemics: biases and remedies,14.581874,5.1326914,2019-01-16,"When analysing new emerging infectious disease outbreaks, one typically has observational data over a limited period of time and several parameters to estimate, such as growth rate, the basic reproduction number R(0), the case fatality rate and distributions of serial intervals, generation times, latency and incubation times and times between onset of symptoms, notification, death and recovery/discharge. These parameters form the basis for predicting a future outbreak, planning preventive measures and monitoring the progress of the disease outbreak. We study inference problems during the emerging phase of an outbreak, and point out potential sources of bias, with emphasis on: contact tracing backwards in time, replacing generation times by serial intervals, multiple potential infectors and censoring effects amplified by exponential growth. These biases directly affect the estimation of, for example, the generation time distribution and the case fatality rate, but can then propagate to other estimates such as R(0) and growth rate. We propose methods to remove or at least reduce bias using statistical modelling. We illustrate the theory by numerical examples and simulations.","Britton, Tom; Scalia Tomba, Gianpaolo",J R Soc Interface,122,1

Despite extensive traditional and molecular epidemiological studies, factors associated with the spread of HPAI among midwestern poultry premises remain unclear. To better understand the dynamics of this outbreak, 182 full genome HPAI H5N2 sequences isolated from commercial layer chicken and turkey production premises were analyzed using evolutionary models able to accommodate epidemiological and geographic information. Epidemiological compartmental models embedded in a phylogenetic framework provided evidence that poultry type acted as a barrier to the transmission of virus among midwestern poultry farms. Furthermore, after initial introduction, the propagation of HPAI cases was self-sustainable within the commercial poultry industries. Discrete trait diffusion models indicated that within state viral transitions occurred more frequently than inter-state transitions. Distance and sample size were very strongly supported as associated with viral transition between county groups (Bayes Factor > 30.0). Together these findings indicate that the different types of midwestern poultry industries were not a single homogenous population, but rather, the outbreak was shaped by poultry industries and geographic factors.","Hicks, Joseph T.; Lee, Dong-Hun; Duvvuri, Venkata R.; Kim Torchetti, Mia; Swayne, David E.; Bahl, Justin",PLoS Pathog,122,11

Antibodies directed against the NiV-glycoprotein (G) protein are known to play a major role in clearing NiV infection and in providing vaccine-induced protective immunity. More recently, T cells have been also shown to be involved in recovery from NiV infection. So far, relatively little is known about the role of T cell responses and the antigenic targets of NiV-G that are recognized by CD8 T cells. In this study, NiV-G protein served as the target immunogen to activate NiV-specific cellular immune responses. Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), a safety-tested strain of vaccinia virus for preclinical and clinical vaccine research, was used for the generation of MVA–NiV-G candidate vaccines expressing different versions of recombinant NiV-G. Overlapping peptides covering the entire NiV-G protein were used to identify major histocompatibility complex class I/II-restricted T cell responses in type I interferon receptor-deficient (IFNAR−/−) mice after vaccination with the MVA–NiV-G candidate vaccines. We have identified an H2-b-restricted nonamer peptide epitope with CD8 T cell antigenicity and a H2-b 15mer with CD4 T cell antigenicity in the NiV-G protein. The identification of this epitope and the availability of the MVA–NiV-G candidate vaccines will help to evaluate NiV-G-specific immune responses and the potential immune correlates of vaccine-mediated protection in the appropriate murine models of NiV-G infection. Of note, a soluble version of NiV-G was advantageous in activating NiV-G-specific cellular immune responses using these peptides.","Kalodimou, Georgia; Veit, Svenja; Jany, Sylvia; Kalinke, Ulrich; Broder, Christopher C.; Sutter, Gerd; Volz, Asisa",Viruses,122,1

In the spleen, spinal cord and cerebral cortex, the ligand bound to saturable sites with a K (d) of about 1 nmol/l and capacities of 134, 240 and 290 fmol/mg protein, respectively. Computer modelling competition curves for 39 drugs, including those for α(2A)-, α(2B)- or α(2C)-adrenoceptor selective drugs, indicated that the sites labelled by [(3)H]-RX821002 in the spleen consisted of a single population of α(2A)-adrenoceptors. However, the competition curves for guanoxabenz were definitely biphasic and resolved into two site fits, indicating that guanoxabenz was binding to both high affinity (K (d) = 35 nmol/1) and low affinity (K (d) = 8900 nmol/1) α(2A)-adrenoceptor sites in the proportions 57% and 43%, respectively. The K (d) (S)for a number of α(2)-adrenoceptor subtype selective drugs, measured in competition with [(3)H]-RX821002 in cerebral cortex and spinal cord, were highly correlated with those obtained in the spleen indicating their α(2A)-adrenoceptor nature. However, by contrast to the results with the spleen, the guanoxabenz competition curves for the spinal cord and cerebral cortex were monophasic and resolved only into one site fits, the K (d) of guanoxabenz being about 4000 nmol/l for both tissues. Drug K (d) (S)for kidney α(2A)-adrenoceptors were also determined using [(3)H]-RX821002. For nearly all drugs tested, the K (d) (S)were highly correlated with those found for the α(2A)-adrenoceptors in the other rat tissues. However, for guanoxabenz, the data indicated that it competed with [(3)H]-RX821002 at a single α(2A)-adrenoceptor site with a K (d) of 39 nmol/1. When the rat α(2A)-adrenoceptor gene RG20 was transiently expressed in COS-7 cells and its ligand binding properties probed using [(3)H]-RX821002, the drug K (d) (S)obtained were also highly correlated with those found for the α(2A)-adrenoceptors in the spleen, cerebral cortex, spinal cord and kidney of the rat. For the RG20 encoded receptor, the guanoxabenz competition curves were steep and monophasic and modelled best into one site fits, with the Kd of guanoxabenz being 5200 nmol/1. It is suggested that guanoxabenz can differentiate between two forms of α(2A)-adrenoceptors in the rat: α(2A1) and α(2A2). The α(2A1)-form is present in the spleen and kidney where it shows a high apparent affinity for guanoxabenz. The α(2A2)-form shows a low apparent affinity for guanoxabenz and is present in the spleen, cerebal cortex and spinal cord. The α(2A2)-form of the rat α(2)-adrenoceptor appears to be encoded by the RG20 gene. The α(2A), and α(2A2)-adrenoceptor forms do not represent high and low affinity receptor forms for agonists because assays included EDTA, Gpp(NH)p and Na(+), which eliminated the high affinity receptors for agonists.","Uhlén, Staffan; Xial, Yun; Chhajlanil, Vijay; Lien, Eric J.; Wikberg, Jarl E.

Quantitation of the protein bands from SDS-PAGE failed to detect any significant effects on the amounts of the shifted 10B protein relative to the in-frame 10A protein under all fidelity conditions tested. However, any changes in fidelity conditions led to inhibition of phage morphogenesis in single-step growth experiments, which could not be accounted for by reduced amounts of phage protein synthesis, nor, at least in the case of decreased accuracy, by reduced amounts of phage DNA synthesis. Reduction in phage DNA synthesis did appear to account for a substantial proportion of the reduction in phage yield seen under conditions of increased accuracy. Similar effects of varying ribosomal fidelity on growth were also seen with phage T3, and to a lesser extent with phage T4.

The sequences were categorized according to sampling region, country, year, subtype, gene name, and sequence and were saved in a database constructed for this study. The relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) values of matrix, capsid, and gp120 and gp41 genes were calculated using correspondence analysis. The synonymous codon usage patterns based on the geographical regions of African countries showed broad distributions; when all the other regions, including Asia, Europe, and the Americas, were taken into account, the Asian countries tended to be divided into two groups. The sequences were clustered into nine non-CRF subtypes. Among these, subtype C showed the most distinct codon usage pattern. To determine why the codon usage patterns in Asian countries were divided into two groups for four target genes, the sequences of the isolates from the Asian countries were analyzed. As a result, the synonymous codon usage patterns among Asian countries were divided into two groups, the southern Asian countries and the other Asian countries, with subtype 01_AE being the most dominant subtype in southern Asia. In summary, the synonymous codon usage patterns among the individual HIV-1 subtypes reflect genetic variations, and this bioinformatics technique may be useful in conjunction with phylogenetic methods for predicting the evolutionary patterns of pandemic viruses.","Ahn, Insung; Son, Hyeon Seok",Exp Mol Med,122,1

Simultaneously, and at each dose of cocaine, unconditioned psychomotor stimulant behavior induced by cocaine was studied in terms of multiple concurrent measures of spontaneous behavior and by activity patterns of locomotion. Time course studies showed that the neurochemical effects of cocaine (10, 20, and 40 mg/kg SC) significantly (p<0.001) increased accumbens synaptic concentrations of dopamine (DA) and concurrently and significantly (p<0.0001) decreased accumbens synaptic concentrations of serotonin (5-HT) in a dose response manner. Simulataneous behavioral time course studies showed that cocaine (10, 20, and 40 mg/kg SC) significantly (p<0.0001) increased ambulations (locomotor activity), fine movements (stereotypic movements of sniffing and grooming) and rearing behavior, while significantly decreasing agoraphobic behavior, as measured by a statistically significant increase in central ambulations (p<0.0001). The high dose of cocaine (40 mg/kg SC) significantly increased fine movements over those produced by the lower doses of cocaine (p<0.0002). One import of the findings is that the DA and 5-HT biogenic amine response occurs in a behavioral paradigm of psychomotor stimulation, which is a known measure of reinforcement. Another is that the biogenic amines DA and 5-HT are affected by cocaine in this reinforcement paradigm with exactly opposite directionality. Finally, acute cocaine administration is shown to produce a dose response inhibition of agoraphobia (fear),w hich is highly correlated (ϱ=.983, p<0.01) with the opposing effects of cocaine on the accumbens biogenic amines, DA and 5-HT.","Broderick, Patricia A.",Pharmacol Biochem Behav,122,1

Consequently, the search for inhibitors of these enzymes has become a very active research field. As a continuation of previous work that showed that 2-thioxanthine (2TX) is an irreversible inhibitor of zinc finger (ZnF)-containing Fpg/Nei DNA glycosylases, we designed and synthesized a mini-library of 2TX-derivatives (TXn) and evaluated their ability to inhibit Fpg/Nei enzymes. Among forty compounds, four TXn were better inhibitors than 2TX for Fpg. Unexpectedly, but very interestingly, two dithiolated derivatives more selectively and efficiently inhibit the zincless finger (ZnLF)-containing enzymes (human and mimivirus Neil1 DNA glycosylases hNeil1 and MvNei1, respectively). By combining chemistry, biochemistry, mass spectrometry, blind and flexible docking and X-ray structure analysis, we localized new TXn binding sites on Fpg/Nei enzymes. This endeavor allowed us to decipher at the atomic level the mode of action for the best TXn inhibitors on the ZnF-containing enzymes. We discovered an original inhibition mechanism for the ZnLF-containing Fpg/Nei DNA glycosylases by disulfide cyclic trimeric forms of dithiopurines. This work paves the way for the design and synthesis of a new structural class of inhibitors for selective pharmacological targeting of hNeil1 in cancer and neurodegenerative diseases.","Rieux, Charlotte; Goffinont, Stéphane; Coste, Franck; Tber, Zahira; Cros, Julien; Roy, Vincent; Guérin, Martine; Gaudon, Virginie; Bourg, Stéphane; Biela, Artur; Aucagne, Vincent; Agrofoglio, Luigi; Garnier, Norbert; Castaing, Bertrand",Int J Mol Sci,122,1

Zoonoses represent an additional threat to public health because the natural reservoirs are often animals, particularly wildlife, thus eluding control efforts such as quarantine, vaccination and social distancing. As there are limited resources available, it is necessary to prioritize diseases in order to allocate resources to those posing the greatest public health threat. Many studies have attempted to prioritize zoonoses, but challenges exist. This study uses a quantitative approach, conjoint analysis (CA), to overcome some limitations of traditional disease prioritization exercises. We used CA to conduct a zoonoses prioritization study involving a range of human and animal health professionals across North America; these included epidemiologists, public health practitioners, research scientists, physicians, veterinarians, laboratory technicians and nurses. A total of 699 human health professionals (HHP) and 585 animal health professionals (AHP) participated in this study. We used CA to prioritize 62 zoonotic diseases using 21 criteria. Our findings suggest CA can be used to produce reasonable criteria scores for disease prioritization. The fitted models were satisfactory for both groups with a slightly better fit for AHP compared to HHP (84.4% certainty fit versus 83.6%). Human‐related criteria were more influential for HHP in their decision to prioritize zoonoses, while animal‐related criteria were more influential for AHP resulting in different disease priority lists. While the differences were not statistically significant, a difference of one or two ranks could be considered important for some individuals. A potential solution to address the varying opinions is discussed. The scientific framework for disease prioritization presented can be revised on a regular basis by updating disease criteria to reflect diseases as they evolve over time; such a framework is of value allowing diseases of highest impact to be identified routinely for resource allocation.","Ng, V.; Sargeant, J.

METHODS: Twenty-two children with repaired cleft palate were allocated into two age groups: younger children (YC: n = 13) and older children (OC: n = 9). VOT measurements from monosyllabic words (/pa/, /ta/, and /ka/) and intraspeaker VOT variability estimated by coefficients of variation (CoV) of two age groups were compared. RESULTS: Age was found to have a statistically significant effect on VOT and VOT variability. Specifically, OC had significantly longer VOT (F(1,66) = 4.196, p < 0.05) and less VOT variability (F(1,66) = 6.007, p < 0.05) for English voiceless stops than YC. No statistically significant main effect for speech sample or age by speech sample interaction was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our data supplement the existing literature by adding VOT and VOT variability information for older children/adolescents with repaired cleft palate. Findings from the study suggest VOT patterns acquired at younger age appear to be further exaggerated and stabilized during the adolescent period among children with repaired cleft palate. A future study is necessary to determine different sources of VOT variability in children with a history of cleft palate, which may have clinical therapeutic implications.","Bae, Youkyung",Folia Phoniatr Logop,122,1

AE37 primarily elicits a CD4+ response while GP2 elicits a CD8+ response against the HER2 antigen. These peptides were tested in a large randomized trial to assess their ability to prevent recurrence in HER2 expressing breast cancer patients. The primary analyses found no difference in 5-year overall disease-free survival (DFS) but possible benefit in subgroups. Here, we present the final landmark analysis. METHODS: In this 4-arm, prospective, randomized, single-blinded, multi-center phase II trial, disease-free node positive and high-risk node negative breast cancer patients enrolled after standard of care therapy. Six monthly inoculations of vaccine (VG) vs. control (CG) were given as the primary vaccine series with 4 boosters at 6-month intervals. Demographic, safety, immunologic, and DFS data were evaluated. RESULTS: 456 patients were enrolled; 154 patients in the VG and 147 in CG for AE37, 89 patients in the VG and 91 in CG for GP2. The AE37 arm had no difference in DFS as compared to CG, but pre-specified exploratory subgroup analyses showed a trend towards benefit in advanced stage (p = 0.132, HR 0.573 CI 0.275–1.193), HER2 under-expression (p = 0.181, HR 0.756 CI 0.499–1.145), and triple-negative breast cancer (p = 0.266, HR 0.443 CI 0.114–1.717). In patients with both HER2 under-expression and advanced stage, there was significant benefit in the VG (p = 0.039, HR 0.375 CI 0.142–0.988) as compared to CG. The GP2 arm had no significant difference in DFS as compared to CG, but on subgroup analysis, HER2 positive patients had no recurrences with a trend toward improved DFS (p = 0.052) in VG as compared to CG. CONCLUSIONS: This phase II trial reveals that AE37 and GP2 are safe and possibly associated with improved clinical outcomes of DFS in certain subgroups of breast cancer patients. With these findings, further evaluations are warranted of AE37 and GP2 vaccines given in combination and/or separately for specific subsets of breast cancer patients based on their disease biology.","Brown, Tommy A.; Mittendorf, Elizabeth A.; Hale, Diane F.; Myers, John W.; Peace, Kaitlin M.; Jackson, Doreen O.; Greene, Julia M.; Vreeland, Timothy J.; Clifton, G.

METHODS: This was a 1-year observational study, as a continuation of the previous 3 months prospective study of pediatric patients with T1D conducted at Sidra Medicine in Qatar. The study enrolled individuals aged 7–18 years with T1D > 1 year, on MDI with self-monitoring of blood glucose or continuous glucose monitoring, with no prior pump experience, and with an HbA1c level < 12.5% (< 113 mmol/mol). After the first 3 months of HCL use, patients were followed at 6, 9 and 12 months, where HbA1c was obtained and pump data were collected. RESULTS: All 30 participants (age 10.24 ± 2.6 years) who initiated HCL completed 12 months of HCL system use in Auto Mode. The participants used the sensor 88.4 ± 6.5% of the time with Auto Mode usage 85.6 ± 7.4% during 12 months of HCL system use. HbA1c decreased from 8.2 ± 1.4% (66 ± 15.3 mmol/mol) at baseline, to 6.7 ± 0.5% (50 ± 5.5 mmol/mol) at 3 months (p = 0.02) and remained stable to 7.1 ± 0.6 (54 ± 6.6 mmol/mol) at 12 months (p = 0.02). TIR (70–180 mg/dL) increased from 46.9% at baseline to 71.9% at 1 month and remained above 70% during the 12 months of HCL use. CONCLUSION: HCL system (MiniMed 670G) in children and adolescents previously treated with MDI significantly improves glycemic outcomes (HbA1c and Time in Ranges) immediately during the first month. This improved glycemic control was maintained over the 1 year following Auto Mode initiation.","Petrovski, Goran; Al Khalaf, Fawziya; Campbell, Judith; Umer, Fareeda; Almajaly, Douha; Hamdan, Manar; Hussain, Khalid",Acta Diabetol,122,31

The interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) is an intrinsic barrier to a range of virus infection, whether IFITM3 is responsible for the p53-mediated anti-JEV response remains elusive. Here, we found that IFITM3 significantly inhibited JEV replication in a protein-palmitoylation-dependent manner and incorporated into JEV virions to diminish the infectivity of progeny viruses. Palmitoylation was also indispensible for keeping IFITM3 from lysosomal degradation to maintain its protein stability. p53 up-regulated IFITM3 expression at the protein level via enhancing IFITM3 palmitoylation. Screening of palmitoyltransferases revealed that zinc finger DHHC domain-containing protein 1 (ZDHHC1) was transcriptionally up-regulated by p53, and consequently ZDHHC1 interacted with IFITM3 to promote its palmitoylation and stability. Knockdown of IFITM3 significantly impaired the inhibitory role of ZDHHC1 on JEV replication. Meanwhile, knockdown of either ZDHHC1 or IFITM3 expression also compromised the p53-mediated anti-JEV effect. Interestingly, JEV reduced p53 expression to impair ZDHHC1 mediated IFITM3 palmitoylation for viral evasion. Our data suggest the existence of a previously unrecognized p53-ZDHHC1-IFITM3 regulatory pathway with an essential role in restricting JEV infection and provide a novel insight into JEV-host interaction.","Wang, Xin; Wu, Zhuanchang; Li, Yuming; Yang, Yifan; Xiao, Changguang; Liu, Xiqian; Xiang, Xiao; Wei, Jianchao; Shao, Donghua; Liu, Ke; Deng, Xufang; Wu, Jiaqiang; Qiu, Yafeng; Li, Beibei; Ma, Zhiyong",PLoS Pathog,122,1

The negative sequela of prenatal comorbid anxiety and depression (CAD) has been suggested to be higher than that of anxiety or depression alone. CAD increases the odds of preterm birth, low birth weight, prolonged labor, operative deliveries, postpartum psychiatric disorders and long term cognitive impairment for the newborn. Despite its significant ill consequences, there is a dearth of studies in low-and middle-income countries. So far, to the best of our knowledge, no study assessed the prevalence of CAD in Ethiopia. Hence, the purpose of this study was to assess CAD and associated factors among pregnant women in Arba Minch Zuria district, Gamo zone, southern Ethiopia. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 676 pregnant women from January 01 to November 30, 2019. Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scales were used to assess depression and anxiety respectively. The data were collected electronically using an open data kit (ODK) collect android application and analyzed using Stata version 15.0. Bivariate and multivariable analyses were carried out to identify factors associated with CAD using binary logistic regression. Statistical significance was set at p-value < 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 667 women were involved. The prevalence of CAD was 10.04% [95% confidence interval (CI): 7.76, 12.33].

Poor management leads to infection with pathogenic bacteria and viruses causing enteritis, the main cause of diarrhea. Efficient drugs should be developed to prevent and treat kids with diarrhea. In the current study, the role of GBacillus-9 in the prevention and treatment of Saanen kids suffering diarrhea was assessed. Our data showed that GBacillus-9 restored the intestinal microbial disorder that resulted from diarrhea and suggested that GBacillus-9 could be used as a product to improve the gut health of kids. ABSTRACT: Bacillus amyloliquefaciens-9 (GBacillus-9), derived from the intestinal tract of the white-spotted bamboo shark, secretes a variety of antimicrobial compounds that inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria. In this study, the role of GBacillus-9 in the prevention and treatment of Saanen kids with diarrhea was assessed. Six healthy kids (HL) and six kids with diarrhea (DL) were selected. All kids were fed with 0.3% (w/v) GBacillus-9 (spray power) in raw milk for two weeks. The proportion of kids with diarrhea decreased gradually as the trial progressed, and 100% DL kids were cured at day 15. GBacillus-9 increased the serum immunoglobulin (Ig) G, interleukin (IL)-4, and IL-6 concentration (p < 0.05). The amplicon sequencing analysis of the fecal bacterial community revealed that the fecal microbiota was remarkably different between the HL and the DL groups at day 0. After two weeks of feeding with GBacillus-9, no significant difference in fecal microbiota was observed between HL and DL groups at the phylum level. GBacillus-9 restored the intestinal microbial disorder associated with serum immunoglobulin and interleukin concentration. Correlation analysis showed that GBacillus-9 altered globulin and interleukin concentration and that immunoglobulin was associated with Firmicutes. Collectively, our results revealed that GBacillus-9 improved the gut health of kids by improving microbial homeostasis.","Zhang, Wenying; Xin, Huijie; Jiang, Nannan; Lv, Zhengbing; Shu, Jianhong; Shi, Hengbo",Animals (Basel),122,1

Liver injury (LI) refers to various pathogenic factors leading to the destruction of stem cells that then affect the liver’s normal function, causing a series of symptoms and abnormal liver function indicators. Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium (CRP) is one of the most commonly used traditional Chinese medicines; it contains flavonoids including hesperidin, nobiletin, and tangeretin. CRP has antibacterial, antioxidant, and antitumor effects that reduce cholesterol, prevent atherosclerosis and decrease LI. Here we analyzed the components of CRP and their targets of action in LI treatment and assessed the relationships between them using a systems pharmacology approach. Twenty-five active ingredients against LI were selected based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometry results and databases. The drug targets and disease-related targets were predicted. The 117 common targets were used to construct a protein-protein interaction network. We identified 1719 gene ontology items in LI treatment, including 1,525 biological processes, 55 cellular components, and 139 molecular functions. These correlated with 49 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways. These findings suggest that CRP may counteract LI by affecting apoptotic, inflammatory, and energy metabolism modules. In vitro experiments suggested that the mechanism may involve hesperidin and naringenin acting on CASP3, BAX, and BCL2 to affect the apoptosis pathway, attenuating liver fibrosis. Naringenin significantly inhibited AKT1 phosphorylation, which in turn mediated activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-Akt signaling pathways against LI. This study provides a reference for systematically exploring the mechanism of CRP’s anti-LI action and is also expands of the application of systems pharmacology in the study of traditional Chinese medicine.","Wu, Jianxiong; Ye, Xietao; Yang, Songhong; Yu, Huan; Zhong, Lingyun; Gong, Qianfeng",Front Pharmacol,122,1

This study aimed to elucidate whether hyperoxemia during resuscitation of patients with trauma was associated with unfavorable outcomes. METHODS: A post hoc analysis of a prospective observational study was carried out at 39 tertiary hospitals in 2016–2018 in adult patients with trauma and injury severity score (ISS) of > 15. Hyperoxemia during resuscitation was defined as PaO(2) of ≥ 300 mmHg on hospital arrival and/or 3 h after arrival. Intensive care unit (ICU)-free days were compared between patients with and without hyperoxemia. An inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPW) analysis was conducted to adjust patient characteristics including age, injury mechanism, comorbidities, vital signs on presentation, chest injury severity, and ISS. Analyses were stratified with intubation status at the emergency department (ED). The association between biomarkers and ICU length of stay were then analyzed with multivariate models. RESULTS: Among 295 severely injured trauma patients registered, 240 were eligible for analysis. Patients in the hyperoxemia group (n = 58) had shorter ICU-free days than those in the non-hyperoxemia group [17 (10–21) vs 23 (16–26), p < 0.001]. IPW analysis revealed the association between hyperoxemia and prolonged ICU stay among patients not intubated at the ED [ICU-free days = 16 (12–22) vs 23 (19–26), p = 0.004], but not among those intubated at the ED [18 (9–20) vs 15 (8–23), p = 0.777]. In the hyperoxemia group, high inflammatory markers such as soluble RAGE and HMGB-1, as well as low lung-protective proteins such as surfactant protein D and Clara cell secretory protein, were associated with prolonged ICU stay. CONCLUSIONS: Hyperoxemia until 3 h after hospital arrival was associated with prolonged ICU stay among severely injured trauma patients not intubated at the ED.

Identifying factors that increase uptake and adherence in self-guided online programs may facilitate the development of targeted implementation strategies to increase engagement with these programs in the community. Using data from a randomized controlled trial of a self-guided online program for depression and anxiety, the aim of this study was to identify predictors of the acceptability of internet-based psychological programs, and engagement (uptake and adherence) with the online program tested in the trial. METHODS: A total of 556 community members with elevated symptoms of depression or anxiety were recruited via social media into the two active conditions of a three-arm randomized controlled trial. This trial tested the effectiveness of a 7-week self-guided online program for depression and anxiety called myCompass 2, delivered with or without an Engagement-Facilitation Intervention. Predictors of uptake (accessing at least one therapeutic module of the program), adherence (modules completed), and acceptability of internet-based psychological programs (Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology, UTAUT scale) were examined, including demographics, mental health status, help-seeking attitudes, stigma, acceptability of internet programs, and personality factors. RESULTS: Logistic regression demonstrated that higher levels of conscientiousness (OR = 1.06, p = .026, 95% CI =1.01–1.12), and acceptability of internet-based psychological programs (OR = 1.09, p = .005, 95% CI =1.03–1.16) predicted greater uptake, and that failing to complete a module was predicted by lower levels of acceptability (OR = 0.88, p = .027, 95% CI =0.78–0.99). Linear regression showed that higher levels of agreeableness (t = 4.66, p < .001), lower levels of stigma (t = −2.28, p = .023) and more positive help-seeking attitudes (t = 2.05, p = .041) predicted higher acceptability attitudes. DISCUSSION: Acceptability of internet-based psychological programs was identified as a factor that increased both uptake and adherence to the myCompass 2 program. Efforts to increase the acceptability of these programs may improve engagement with these programs in the community. It may also be useful to consider personality traits and clinical profiles when considering the appropriate audience for self-guided internet interventions.","Gulliver, Amelia; Calear, Alison L.; Sunderland, Matthew; Kay-Lambkin, Frances; Farrer, Louise M.; Batterham, Philip J.",Internet Interv,122,1

In this prospective study, 579 simultaneous intra- and postoperative cardiac index measurements obtained with Starling SV, FloTrac/EV1000 and TDCO were compared in 20 patients undergoing OPCAB. The agreement of data was investigated by Bland–Altman plots, while trending ability was assessed by four-quadrant plots with error grids. In comparison with TDCO, Starling SV was associated with a bias of 0.13 L min(−1) m(−2) (95% confidence interval, 95% CI, 0.07 to 0.18), wide limits of agreement (LOA, − 1.23 to 1.51 L min(−1) m(−2)), a percentage error (PE) of 60.7%, and poor trending ability. In comparison with TDCO, FloTrac was associated with a bias of 0.01 L min(−1) m(−2) (95% CI − 0.05 to 0.06), wide LOA (− 1.27 to 1.29 L min(−1) m(−2)), a PE of 56.8% and poor trending ability. Both Starling SV and fourth-generation FloTrac showed acceptable mean bias but imprecision due to wide LOA and high PE, and poor trending ability.

Hypocalcemia is the potential complication after thyroidectomy, where is persistency can lead to serious systemic effects. The aim of this study is to evaluate the incidence of hypocalcemia in thyroidectomy patients. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, patients referred to (XXX) for thyroidectomy from 2019 to 2020 were enrolled. Preoperative serum calcium and postoperative 24- and 48-h calcium levels were evaluated in these patients. Demographic data (sex and gender), calcium levels, type of thyroidectomy and duration of surgery was recorded for all the patients. SPSS v22 was used for statistical analysis. P < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. RESULTS: Of 143 patients included in the study, the mean age was 49.7 ± 10.9 years and 61.5% were females and 38.5% were males. 49% patients had hypocalcemia in the first 24 hours after surgery and 63.6% following 48 hours of the surgery. The difference in calcium levels at three intervals were statistically significant, p = 0.001. The incidence of hypocalcemia was significantly more in women at 48 postoperative hours, p = 0.025. The age and duration of surgery was not significantly correlated with hypocalcemia, p > 0.05, whereas, patients who underwent total thyroidectomy had greater incidence of hypocalcemia 24 hours after the surgery, p = 0.021. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of hypocalcemia is greater in total thyroidectomy and female patients. Our study did not report significant correlation between duration of the surgery and age of the patients.","Azadbakht, Morteza; Emadi-jamali, Seyed Mostafa; Azadbakht, Saleh",Ann Med Surg (Lond),122,1

As a potential method of early detection, we examined whether readily available and routinely measured clinical biochemical diagnostic test data could predict poor nutritional status. We combined 2008–2017 data of 1518 free-living individuals ≥50 years from the United Kingdom National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS) and used logistic regression to determine associations between routine biochemical diagnostic test data, micronutrient deficiency biomarkers, and established malnutrition indicators (components of screening tools) in a three-step validation process. A prediction model was created to determine how effectively routine biochemical diagnostic tests and established malnutrition indicators predicted poor nutritional status (defined by ≥1 micronutrient deficiency in blood of vitamins B(6), B(12) and C; selenium; or zinc). Significant predictors of poor nutritional status were low concentrations of total cholesterol, haemoglobin, HbA1c, ferritin and vitamin D status, and high concentrations of C-reactive protein; except for HbA1c, these were also associated with established malnutrition indicators. Additional validation was provided by the significant association of established malnutrition indicators (low protein, fruit/vegetable and fluid intake) with biochemically defined poor nutritional status. The prediction model (including biochemical tests, established malnutrition indicators and covariates) showed an AUC of 0.79 (95% CI: 0.76–0.81), sensitivity of 66.0% and specificity of 78.1%. Clinical routine biochemical diagnostic test data have the potential to facilitate early detection of malnutrition risk in free-living older populations. However, further validation in different settings and against established malnutrition screening tools is warranted.","Truijen, Saskia P. M.; Hayhoe, Richard P.

Those who contract the influenza virus will typically develop a mild illness. However, for populations at a higher risk, including those diagnosed with dementia, influenza is proven to be more detrimental. Persons with dementia (PWD) face a serious threat to influenza on an annual basis, and vaccine hesitancy may further potentiate this risk. The purpose of this paper is to explore and understand the barriers PWD face in receiving the influenza vaccine. METHODS: A literature review was conducted to examine the barriers that prevent PWD from seeking out the annual influenza vaccine. A thematic analysis provided an understanding of the overarching relationships found among the influences between the identified themes. RESULTS: Three main influences were identified: (1) intra-personal, (2) inter-personal, and (3) extra-personal, with each influence containing several subsequent sub-themes. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: The literature review found that there is a lack of research involving this high-risk population and the barriers they face, especially within the extra-personal influences. Further research is required to understand how each barrier relates and connects with each other. Understanding this connection will aid public health organizations in decreasing the threat of vaccine hesitancy, thus decreasing the incidents of preventable deaths.","Ashtarieh, Bahar; Grabkowski, Magda; Bartfay, Emma; Sun, Winnie",Aging Clin Exp Res,122,1

Today, known genomes of humans and domestic and wild animals arouse interest in a common whole-genome pattern of animal domestication that may at least explain differences between the effects of natural and artificial environments on organisms. Accordingly, here we identified genes differing in expression between tame and aggressive rats (a laboratory domestication model) to compare them with all such known changes of genes’ activity (available in databases) in other domestic versus wild animals (e.g., dogs versus wolves). The results show that the majority of these genes changed their expression similarly among all the domestic versus wild animals studied, i.e., explained two-thirds of the variance, while the remaining one-third reflected animal intraspecific and interspecific variation, just as the gold standard of variation in nature. Accordingly, here we found that the artificial environment of domestic animals alters activities of genes in the same direction as that seen in corresponding human genes during human diseases, whereas the natural environment maintains a normal gene expression pattern in wild animals (matching human health). ABSTRACT: Belyaev’s concept of destabilizing selection during domestication was a major achievement in the XX century. Its practical value has been realized in commercial colors of the domesticated fox that never occur in the wild and has been confirmed in a wide variety of pet breeds. Many human disease models involving animals allow to test drugs before human testing. Perhaps this is why investigators doing transcriptomic profiling of domestic versus wild animals have searched for breed-specific patterns. Here we sequenced hypothalamic transcriptomes of tame and aggressive rats, identified their differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and, for the first time, applied principal component analysis to compare them with all the known DEGs of domestic versus wild animals that we could find. Two principal components, PC1 and PC2, respectively explained 67% and 33% of differential-gene-expression variance (hereinafter: log(2) value) between domestic and wild animals. PC1 corresponded to multiple orthologous DEGs supported by homologs; these DEGs kept the log(2) value sign from species to species and from tissue to tissue (i.e., a common domestication pattern). PC2 represented stand-alone homologous DEG pairs reversing the log(2) value sign from one species to another and from tissue to tissue (i.e., representing intraspecific and interspecific variation).","Chadaeva, Irina; Ponomarenko, Petr; Kozhemyakina, Rimma; Suslov, Valentin; Bogomolov, Anton; Klimova, Natalya; Shikhevich, Svetlana; Savinkova, Ludmila; Oshchepkov, Dmitry; Kolchanov, Nikolay A.; Markel, Arcady; Ponomarenko, Mikhail",Animals (Basel),122,1

This study aimed to evaluate respiratory functions and radiologic sequelae according to the severity of infection one year after the patients experienced MERS-CoV infection. METHODS: A total of 73 patients undergoing MERS-CoV infection during the 2015 MERS outbreak in South Korea were enrolled in this prospective multicenter study. Pulmonary function tests and 6-minute walking tests were performed 1 year after infection. Radiologic sequelae was defined as fibrosis or atelectasis on chest computer tomography and severe pneumonia was defined as that requiring oxygen therapy. Multivariate linear regression tests were used to evaluate the effect of infection severity on respiratory function. RESULTS: At the time of MERS-CoV infection, 18 patients had no pneumonia, 35 experienced mild pneumonia, and 20 did severe pneumonia. The median age was not different between groups (P = 0.942). Forced vital capacity (FVC) was 102.6%, 94.9%, and 88.7% in the no, mild, and severe pneumonia group, respectively (P = 0.010) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second was 105.3%, 95.7%, and 91.7% (P = 0.057). Diffusing capacity (DLCO) was significantly lower in the severe pneumonia group than in the no or mild pneumonia group (78.3% vs. 89.4% or 88.6%, P = 0.035). In multivariate analyses, FVC and DLCO were significantly correlated with infection severity after adjustment with age, sex, underlying lung disease, and smoking. There was no difference in the walking distance of 6 minute tests between groups. Radiologic sequelae were shown in 18.8%, 65.6%, and 100% in the no, mild, and severe pneumonia group, respectively (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The patients with more severe pneumonia by MERS-CoV had more impaired respiratory function in one year follow-up, which was compatible with radiologic sequelae.

A good percentage of the orchids are commonly cultivated as ornamental plants and many hybrids have been produced with Calanthe and Cymbidium. TCM makes use of 14 species of Calanthe and Rumphius who authored Hut Amboinesche Kruidboek [the Amboinese Herbal, Volumes 1–6 (1741–1750), published posthumously] described Calanthe triplicata. Calanthe species contain compounds with antitumour and hair-restoring properties. Fourteen species of Coelogyne are medicinal and several have been studied phytochemically by Majumder’s group in Calcutta. Another large group, Cymbidium, with 17 medicinal species, is also much studied. Lectins present in some species suppress replication of coronaviruses, toroviruses and viruses. An interesting compound that suppresses angiogenesis has been discovered in Cremastra appendiculata and it may find a role in preventing blindness and spread of cancers. Cyrtosia is a homomycotrophic genus and should be an interesting subject for phytochemical studies.","Teoh, Eng Soon",Medicinal Orchids of Asia,122,17

After staining, bacterial pathogens were recognized in the light microscope because of their size and could be cultivated in culture media. Viruses evaded this approach, as they are significantly smaller, and as obligate parasites are not able to multiply in cell culture media. Although some viral infections could be associated with specific cellular changes and certain depositions in the infected tissue around the turn of the century, e.g. Negri inclusion bodies in nerve cells during rabies, a specific diagnosis was only possible through the development of cell culture methods and modern molecular biology. Today, viral infections can be detected directly by determining the agents, individual viral proteins, or their genetic information, or other materials in the blood of infected people or animals by using appropriate methods. Direct detection of viruses is possible, with the exception of latent or persistent infection forms, only during the acute phase of the disease. In some cases, the pathogens are present in the infected organism only before the symptomatic phase, so the direct detection of the virus is frequently not successful. Therefore, infections or contact with pathogens is usually demonstrated in virus diagnostics indirectly by characterization of the developing specific immune response.","Modrow, Susanne; Falke, Dietrich; Truyen, Uwe; Schätzl, Hermann",Molecular Virology,122,1

However, some jurisdictions, particularly the United States, have provisions and procedures for screening human remains along the same lines as they do cargo. As this article will discuss, the trouble with this subject is that it has not been given the attention it requires, which has led to a hopelessly fragmented approach in regulating this aspect of air cargo. The High Level Conference on Aviation Security, convened by the International Civil Aviation Organization from 12 to 14 September 2012 in Montreal, focused on three overarching themes - cargo security, sustainability of security measures and innovation in addressing threats to aviation security. The Conference did not address the carriage by air of human remains from a security perspective. However, if one were to apply one of the key principles recognized by the Conference – that each State should ensure that appropriate security controls, including screening where applicable, are applied to cargo and mail, prior to their being loaded onto an aircraft engaged in passenger commercial air transport operations, the operative words would be “security controls” which bring to bear the reality that different States could have different security controls and that they should be harmonized. This article discusses the manner in which such controls can be harmonized from a regulatory perspective in the context of the carriage by air of human remains.","Abeyratne, Ruwantissa",,122,0

Incidences ranging from 2 to 24% have been reported, which might reflect different autopsy policies amongst centres. Recent studies have shown that many patients with invasive aspergillosis do not have a haematological diagnosis. Instead, conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and liver failure became recognized as important risk factors. The diagnosis remains difficult in these patients, since diagnostic tests have not been widely validated outside the haematological boundaries. Mechanical ventilation precludes the interpretation of clinical signs and radiological diagnosis is clouded by underlying lung pathology. Respiratory cultures lack sensitivity and specificity. At the moment, diagnosis is best made by testing for galactomannan in bronchoalveolar fluid samples (sensitivity and specificity of > 87%). Testing galactomannan in sera has limited sensitivity for the non-neutropenic. Modern diagnostic tests such as PCR and beta-glucan have never been validated in an ICU population. Due mostly to major delays in the diagnosis, mortality exceeds 50%. Although our therapeutic armamentarium against invasive aspergillosis has improved in recent years, data concerning safety and efficacy of new antifungal agents in the ICU setting are lacking.","Meersseman, Wouter",Aspergillosis: From Diagnosis to Prevention,122,1

Ten mice were randomly selected as normal group (n = 10, without any treatment) and 60 septic mice with acute respiratory distress syndrome were divided into model group (n = 10, without any treatment), negative control (NC) mimic group (n = 10, injected with NC mimic), miR-146b-3p mimic group (n = 10, injected with miR-146b-3p mimic), si-NC group (n = 10, injected with PI3Kγ siRNA NC), si-PI3Kγ group (n = 10, injected with PI3Kγ silencing plasmid), and miR-146b-3p mimic + oe-PI3Kγ group (n = 10, injected with miR-146b-3p mimic + PI3Kγ overexpression plasmid). We found that miR-146b-3p negatively regulated PI3Kγ. Compared with normal group, model mice had decreased expression of miR-146b-3p, increased expressions of PI3Kγ, p-AKT, ASC, NLRP3 and Caspase-1 proteins, higher W/D ratio, and more serum IL-1β and IL-18 content (all P < 0.05). All indicators in miR-146b-3p mimic group and si-PI3Kγ group were significantly improved as compared to model group (all P < 0.05). Over-expression of PI3Kγ could weaken the treatment effect of miR-146b-3p mimic in model mice. Therefore, up-regulation of miR-146b-3p can inhibit PI3K/AKT signaling pathway to improve acute respiratory distress syndrome in septic mice.","Liu, Yao; Zhu, Jin-Qiang; Jin, Xiao-Hong; Dong, Mei-Ping; Zheng, Jun-Fen",J Bioenerg Biomembr,122,1

Methods ([2, 11, 21]) and programs for automation exist (e.g. [1, 4, 10]) but often need case-specific tuning of many meta-parameters (e.g. mask, pyramid-scales, denoise, transform-type, method/metric, optimizer and its parameters). Other programs, that apparently only depend on a few parameter often just hide many of the remaining ones (initialized with default values), often cannot handle challenging cases satisfactorily. Instead of spending much time on the search for suitable meta-parameters that yield a usable result for the complete image series, the described approach allows to intervene by manually aligning problematic image pairs. The manually found transform is then used by the automatic alignment as an initial transformation that is then optimized as in the pure automatic case. Therefore the manual alignment does not have to be very precise. This way the worst case time consumption is limited and can be estimated (manual alignment of the whole series) in contrast to tuning of meta-parameters of pure auto-alignment of complete series which can hardly be guessed.","Grothausmann, Roman; Zukić, Dženan; McCormick, Matt; Mühlfeld, Christian; Knudsen, Lars",Biomedical Image Registration,122,1

This is done by changing the definition of the soft neighbourhood of the classified object. The first approach is to change the neighbourhood to be more local by changing the Gaussian potential function approach to the nearest neighbour rule. The second one is to weight the instances that are included in the neighbourhood. The instances are weighted inversely proportional to the a priori class probability. The experimental results show that for one of the investigated base classifiers, the usage of the KNN neighbourhood significantly improves the classification results. What is more, the application of the weighting schema also offers a significant improvement.","Trajdos, Pawel; Kurzynski, Marek",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,122,1

Herein, we describe a new mock circuit that enables experimental ECCO(2)R research without animal models. In a second step, we use this model to investigate three experimental scenarios of ECCO(2)R: (I) the influence of hemoglobin concentration on CO(2) removal. (II) a potentially portable ECCO(2)R that uses air instead of oxygen, (III) a low-flow ECCO(2)R that achieves effective CO(2) clearance by recirculation and acidification of the limited blood volume of a small dual lumen cannula (such as a dialysis catheter). RESULTS: With the presented ECCO(2)R mock, CO(2) removal rates comparable to previous studies were obtained. The mock works with either fresh porcine blood or diluted expired human packed red blood cells. However, fresh porcine blood was preferred because of better handling and availability. In the second step of this work, hemoglobin concentration was identified as an important factor for CO(2) removal. In the second scenario, an air-driven ECCO(2)R setup showed only a slightly lower CO(2) wash-out than the same setup with pure oxygen as sweep gas. In the last scenario, the low-flow ECCO(2)R, the blood flow at the test membrane lung was successfully raised with a recirculation channel without the need to increase cannula flow. Low recirculation ratios resulted in increased efficiency, while high recirculation ratios caused slightly reduced CO(2) removal rates. Acidification of the CO(2) depleted blood in the recirculation channel caused an increase in CO(2) removal rate. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate a simple and cost effective, yet powerful, “in-vitro” ECCO(2)R model that can be used as an alternative to animal experiments for many research scenarios. Moreover, in our approach parameters such as hemoglobin level can be modified more easily than in animal models.","Schwärzel, Leonie S.; Jungmann, Anna M.; Schmoll, Nicole; Seiler, Frederik; Muellenbach, Ralf M.; Schenk, Joachim; Dinh, Quoc Thai; Bals, Robert; Lepper, Philipp M.; Omlor, Albert J.",Intensive Care Med Exp,122,1

To address these issues, elaboration and implementation of psychological/psychiatric interventions or strategies is of utmost importance. In this context, this systematic review aimed at identifying strategies to manage mental health issues in healthcare workers during infectious disease outbreaks. METHODS: PubMed, Cochrane, Scopus and Web of Science were searched to retrieve pertinent articles published in English until May 2020. Articles reporting measures, interventions, strategies, or recommendations to manage mental health problems in healthcare workers during an infectious disease outbreak, of any study design were included. The quality assessment was performed according to the study design of the included articles. RESULTS: Our search strategy produced a total of 2358 articles. After the screening process 33 articles met the inclusion criteria, addressing COVID-19 (40%), followed by SARS (21%) and Ebola Virus (15%). The findings emphasized that organisations should follow an evidence-based approach and establish comprehensive programs to assist hospital staff during disease outbreaks. The preliminary results show that the creation of a psychological response team, training, e-learning, courses, psychosocial counselling, screening instruments and telemedicine activities could improve the capacity of response and coping, and reduce mental health issues in healthcare workers. CONCLUSIONS: To minimize the psychological impact of future infectious disease outbreaks, evidence-based intervention strategies should be implemented to retain mental health among healthcare workers. Our results may provide the necessary insights that could be applied during the COVID-19 pandemic. KEY MESSAGES: During infectious disease outbreaks healthcare workers are faced with mental health issues, that need to be addressed through tailored interventions offering coping strategies and increase resilience. Mental health related interventions or strategies include the implementation of professional training, psychosocial counselling, courses, and the creation of a psychological response team.","Zace, D; Hoxhaj, I; Orfino, A; Viteritti, A M; Silvetti, L; Di Pietro, M L",Eur J Public Health,122,1

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study with isolated and non-isolated patients. SETTING: One public university hospital in the Valencian Community (southeast Spain). PARTICIPANTS: We consecutively collected 400 patients, 200 isolated and 200 non-isolated, age ≥18 years old, to match according to date of entry, admission department, sex, age (±5 years) and disease severity from April 2017 to October 2018. Exclusion criteria: patients age <18 years old and/or reverse isolation patients. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome as the AE, defined according to the National Study of Adverse Effects linked to Hospitalisation (Estudio Nacional Sobre los Efectos Adversos) criteria. Cumulative incidence rates and AE incidence density rates were calculated. RESULTS: The incidence of isolated patients with AEs 16.5% (95% CI 11.4% to 21.6%) compared with 9.5% (95% CI 5.4% to 13.6%) in non-isolated (p<0.03). The incidence density of patients with AEs among isolated patients was 11.8 per 1000 days/patient (95% CI 7.8 to 15.9) compared with 4.3 per 1000 days/patient (95% CI 2.4 to 6.3) among non-isolated patients (p<0.001). The incidence of AEs among isolated patients was 18.5% compared with 11% for non-isolated patients (p<0.09). Among the 37 AEs detected in 33 isolated patients, and the 22 AEs detected in 19 non-isolated patients, most corresponded to healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) for both isolated and non-isolated patients (48.6% vs 45.4%). There were significant differences with respect to the preventability of AEs, (67.6% among isolated patients compared with 52.6% among non-isolated patients). CONCLUSIONS: AEs were significantly higher in isolated patients compared with non-isolated patients, more than half being preventable and with HAIs as the primary cause. It is essential to improve training and the safety culture of healthcare professionals relating to the care provided to this type of patient.","Jiménez-Pericás, Fátima; Gea Velázquez de Castro, María Teresa; Pastor-Valero, María; Aibar Remón, Carlos; Miralles, Juan José; Meyer García, María del Carmen; Aranaz Andrés, Jesús Maria",BMJ Open,122,1

Given the consequences of AUD for immunocompromised patients, this recommendation was implemented using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) for patients with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) at Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, Michigan. This is a medical-student led, retrospective study to determine the impact of AUD in HIV patients that were screened using the AUDIT self-administered questionnaire. METHODS: All HIV patients undergoing outpatient care at the Beaumont Hospital HIV clinic were provided this self-administered AUDIT questionnaire as part of routine, check-in procedure by clinic staff starting on February 5, 2019. Scores were divided into “At Risk” or “Not At Risk” categories. Men (aged 18-60) screened positive for at-risk drinking if they scored 8 or higher. Men (older than 60) and women of all ages screened positive for at-risk drinking if they scored 4 or higher. This categorization of risk was determined using the criteria established by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. Analysis between groups was made using T-Tests, Chi-Square tests, and odds ratios (OR), with corresponding 95% Confidence Intervals. RESULTS: A total of 121 HIV patients completed at least one AUDIT form. There were a total of 157 patient encounters. The mean age of “At Risk” drinkers was significantly higher than the mean age of “Not at Risk” drinkers, at initial visits and all visits, respectively (55.75 years vs. 46.25 years, p = 0.0117; 55.33 years vs. 46.29 years, p = 0.0075). These findings are depicted in Tables 1 and 2. Table 1: Differences in Health Status between “At Risk” and “Not at Risk” Individuals (Initial Visit Only) [Image: see text] Table 2: Differences in Health Status between “At Risk” and “Not at Risk” Individuals (All Visits) [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: The preliminary results of this study demonstrate the importance of screening for AUD within the vulnerable HIV patient population. More specifically, it highlights the value of screening older individuals who may be at increased risk of hazardous drinking. In March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic required transitioning to a telemedicine platform, thereby preventing completion of AUDIT paper forms. Thus, we will leverage technology by incorporating the AUDIT into electronic medical records, in effort to fortify this quality improvement initiative and ensure patient centered care.

The Paterson Communicable Disease Strike Team (PCDST) was established by leveraging skills and using existing public health staff of the health department team which led to a timely and robust public health intervention. METHODS: PCDST comprised of 25 communicable disease investigators/contact tracers established in preparation for public health response in the event of large-scale communicable disease outbreaks pre-COVID. In March 2020 with initial COVID-19 cases in Paterson, PCDST was activated utilizing NJ DOH’s Communicable Disease Reporting and Surveillance System (CDRSS). Additional staff members were cross-trained to augment team as new cases surged. A triage coordinator would identify and assign new cases to disease investigators at a 24/7 schedule. Disease Investigators would provide test results, perform epidemiological case interviews, elicit close contacts, and provide isolation/quarantine recommendations. Case-contact monitors followed up daily basis until completion of isolation/quarantine period. RESULTS: As of June 15, 2020, 6537 cases tested COVID-19 (+) in Paterson, NJ. 91% of cases and their contacts were interviewed. Peak occurred in mid-April with 263 cases on a single day. By mid-June, daily number of cases declined to 7/day. Reported COVID-19 mortality rate in Paterson (4.65%), compared to surrounding towns in the same county of Passaic (6%), other large cities in New Jersey (Newark 8%, Jersey City 7.4%) and New Jersey state (7.59%). CONCLUSION: Despite limited resources, we were able to cross train and engage our frontline public health team (PCDST) to investigate and effectively contact trace new COVID-19 cases to help contain spread of infection. Although its unclear if our intervention impacted mortality rates, it is certain that contact tracing using a trained public health workforce is a model that has proven successful in Paterson. A local public health workforce vested in their communities can develop rapport needed to build trust and confidence in an intervention that elicits confidential medical information to limit viral transmission.

To do so, we apply a Markov regime-switching (MS) vector autoregressive with exogenous variables (VARX) model to a daily dataset from 25-July-2016 to 1-April-2020. The results indicate various patterns of spillover in high and low volatility regimes, especially during the COVID-19 outbreak. The total spillover index varies with time and abruptly intensifies following the outbreak of COVID-19, especially in the high volatility regime. Notably, the network analysis reveals further evidence of much higher spillovers in the high volatility regime during the COVID-19 outbreak, which is consistent with the notion of contagion during stress periods.","Shahzad, Syed Jawad Hussain; Bouri, Elie; Kang, Sang Hoon; Saeed, Tareq",Financ Innov,122,1

Nearly all arboviruses are RNA viruses with high mutation frequencies, which leaves them vulnerable to genetic drift and fitness losses owing to population bottlenecks during vector infection, dissemination from the midgut to the salivary glands and transmission to the vertebrate host. However, despite these bottlenecks, they seem to avoid fitness declines that can result from Muller’s ratchet. In addition, founder effects that occur during the geographic introductions of human-amplified arboviruses, including chikungunya virus and Zika virus, can affect epidemic and endemic circulation, as well as virulence. In this Review, we discuss the role of genetic drift following population bottlenecks and founder effects in arboviral evolution and spread, and the emergence of human disease.","Weaver, Scott C.; Forrester, Naomi L.; Liu, Jianying; Vasilakis, Nikos",Nat Rev Microbiol,122,8

Materials & methods: The available genome and protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 with known human and nonhuman CoV were analyzed using multiple sequence alignment programs. Results: Our analysis revealed some unique mutations in SARS-CoV-2 spike, ORF1a/b, ORF3a/3b and ORF8. The most interesting ones were in the spike angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor binding-motif and generation of a furin-like cleavage site as well as deletions of ORF3a ‘diacidic motif’ and the entire ORF3b. Conclusion: Our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has diverged from SARS-CoV-1 but is most close to bat-SL-CoV. Unique mutations in spike and ORF3a/b proteins strongly endorse its adaptive evolution, enhanced infectivity and severe pathogenesis in humans.","Padhan, Kartika; Parvez, Mohammad K; Al-Dosari, Mohammed S",,122,13

Our objective was to analyze how many teen pregnancies were in an Obstetrics and Gynaecology Hospital from Romania over a two-year period and underline the role that midwives have in preventing teenage pregnancies. A descriptive study of a group of 343 childbearing teenagers out of 7020 childbearing women who gave birth in 2017-2018 is presented. The teenagers were evaluated by age, the number of pregnancies, birth complications, way of delivery, and place of origin. The involvement of the midwife was highlighted. From the total of 7020 analyzed cases, 4.8% (n=343) were teen pregnancies. Within this group, 4.37%(n=15)were already at the third birth and 89.79 (n=308)were un-investigated during the entire pregnancy. Sixty-eight point fifty-one percent (68.51%; n=235)of the teenagers gave birth with the aid of a midwife while 4.66 (n=16) gave birth with no medical attendance and experienced homebirth. All the teenagers that gave birth at home were from rural areas and not married. High teenage pregnancy rates are determined in Romania by the low level of information about sexuality and family planning at young ages. The midwives have the ability to help to resolve these problems if they were more allowed to be involved in these programs, especially in rural areas.","Radu, Mihaela C; Dumitrescu, Anca I; Zaharia, Corneliu; Boeru, Calin; Pop-Tudose, Melania E; Iancu, Claudia F; Chivu, Razvan D",,122,13

In many cases, these environments include representations of other humans, either as stand-ins for real humans (avatars) or artificial entities (agents). Presence and individual identity of such virtual characters is usually coded by visual features, such as visibility in certain locations and appearance in terms of looks. For people with visual impairments (VI), this creates a barrier to detecting and identifying co-present characters and interacting with them. To improve the inclusiveness of such social virtual environments, we investigate which cues people with VI use to detect and recognize others and their activities in real-world settings. For this, we conducted an online survey with fifteen participants (adults and children). Our findings indicate an increased reliance on multimodal information: vision for silhouette recognition; audio for the recognition through pace, white cane, jewelry, breathing, voice and keyboard typing; sense of smell for fragrance, food smell and airflow; tactile information for length of hair, size, way of guiding or holding the hand and the arm, and the reactions of a guide-dog. Environmental and social cues indicate if somebody is present: e. g. a light turned on in a room, or somebody answering a question. Many of these cues can already be implemented in virtual environments with avatars and are summarized by us in a set of guidelines.","Thevin, Lauren; Machulla, Tonja",Computers Helping People with Special Needs,122,22

The rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)/(COVID-19) leads to the infection of many patients with underlying chronic liver diseases. As a relatively new disease, management of COVID-19, in the context of chronic liver disease, is mainly based on the experience of the treating physician and the available data. In this review, we summarize the available evidence about the management of liver disease patients, in the context of COVID-19 infection, which can increase the severity of viral hepatitis B. Also, its clearance in HBV patients is delayed. A sixfold increased severity of COVID-19 was reported in obese patients with metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFDL). In patients with autoimmune liver disease (AILD), it is not recommended to change their immunosuppressive therapy (as long as they are not infected with COVID-19), in order to avoid a flare of liver disease. However, immunosuppressant drugs should be modified, in the case of infection with COVID-19. To date, no data suggest an increased risk or severity in metabolic liver diseases, such as hemochromatosis, Wilson’s disease, or alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Patients with liver cirrhosis should be carefully managed with minimum exposure to healthcare facilities. Basic investigations for follow-up can be scheduled at wider intervals; if patients need admission, this should be in COVID-19-clean areas. Patients with hepatocellular carcinomas may have a poor prognosis according to preliminary reports from China. The course of COVID-19 in liver transplant recipients on immunosuppression seems to have a benign course, based on few reports in children and adults. The hepatotoxicity of COVID-19 drugs ranges from mild liver enzyme elevation to a flare of underlying liver diseases. Therefore, the decision should be customized.

However, the COVID‐19 pandemic reinforces these lessons for investors and their advisors when encountering the next large market decline.","Lamdin, Douglas J.",,122,2

We therefore investigated whether frailty and multimorbidity were associated with risk of hospitalisation with COVID-19 in the UK Biobank. Method 502,640 participants aged 40–69 years at baseline (54–79 years at COVID-19 testing) were recruited across UK 2006–10. A modified assessment of frailty using Fried’s classification was generated from baseline data. COVID-19 test results (England) were available 16/03/2020–01/06/2020, mostly taken in hospital settings. Logistic regression was used to discern associations between frailty, multimorbidity and COVID-19 diagnoses, adjusting for sex, age, BMI, ethnicity, education, smoking and number of comorbidity groupings, comparing COVID-19 positive, COVID-19 negative and non-tested groups. RESULTS: 4,510 participants were tested for COVID-19 (positive = 1,326, negative = 3,184). 497,996 participants were not tested. Compared to the non-tested group, after adjustment, COVID-19 positive participants were more likely to be frail (OR = 1.4 [95%CI = 1.1, 1.8]), report slow walking speed (OR = 1.3 [1.1, 1.6]), report two or more falls in the past year (OR = 1.3 [1.0, 1.5]) and be multimorbid (≥4 comorbidity groupings vs 0–1: OR = 1.9 [1.5, 2.3]). However, similar strength of associations were apparent when comparing COVID-19 negative and non-tested groups. Furthermore, frailty and multimorbidity were not associated with COVID-19 diagnoses, when comparing COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative participants. CONCLUSIONS: Frailty and multimorbidity do not appear to aid risk stratification, in terms of a positive versus negative results of COVID-19 testing. Investigation of the prognostic value of these markers for adverse clinical sequelae following COVID-19 disease is urgently needed.","Woolford, S J; D’Angelo, S; Curtis, E M; Parsons, C M; Ward, K A; Dennison, E M; Patel, H P; Cooper, C; Harvey, N C",Age Ageing,122,1

We explore the optimal conditional heteroscedasticity model with regards to goodness‐of‐fit to these sectorial indices. In particular, it proposes four models (EGARCH, FIGARCH, FIEGARCH and TGARCH) to measure asymmetric and persistence volatility. Our findings point to three interesting results. First, following the COVID‐19 outbreak, volatility is more persistent in all series. Second, the results show that building constructs materials, construction and food and beverage sector return volatilities have an insignificant asymmetric effect while consumer service, financials and distribution, industrials, basic materials and banks sector return volatilities have relatively high positive and significant asymmetric effect compared with those during the pre‐COVID‐19 period. Finally, the findings show that financial services, automobile and parts, insurance and TUNINDEX20 sectors have insignificant leverage effect.

During the intensive pandemic until normalization, 253 patients aged ≥ 18 years who underwent elective surgery with two negative RT-PCR results within the last 5 days and CO-RADS scale ≤ 3 on chest CT were included in the study. Demographic characteristics, American Society of Anesthesiologists classification, type of anesthesia and surgery, department of clinic, chest CT findings, scale of CO-RADS and TSS on CT, patients’ postoperative hospital stay, follow-up time, and vital status (whether or not COVID-19 disease) at the hospital and discharge information were collected for each patient. RESULTS: The most frequently calculated CO-RADS score was found to be 1 (73.1%). It was followed by scale of CO-RADS 2 (20.9%). Regarding TSS, the most common TSS for the right and left lungs was 0 (91.7% and 92.5%, respectively). COVID-19 was not detected in any of the patients who were hospitalized for an average of 4.9 ± 6.4 days and followed-up for an average of 14.3 ± 8.2 days. It was observed that the CO-RADS score and TSS were positively and moderately correlated with each other (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: It was concluded that in early diagnostic of COVID-19, chest CT scans serve like a complementary diagnostic method in addition to RT-PCR testing to keep safe both the patients and health professionals and the scale of CO-RADS and TSS on CT are valuable in correlation with each other.","Arslan, Gülten; Saraçoğlu, Kemal Tolga; Aydiner, Ömer; Demirhan, Recep",Egypt J Radiol Nucl Med,122,16

Methods: Seventeen healthy sports volunteers with at least 3 years of sports activities participated in the experiment. After 2 weeks of familiarization performed without any stimulation, each participant received either 50 Hz-tACS or sham-tACS. Before and after stimulation, subjects performed the following tests: (1) the squat jump with the hands on the hips (SJ); (2) countermovement jump with the hands on the hips (CMJ); (3) countermovement jump with arm swing (CMJ-AS); (4) 15-s Bosco’s test; (5) seated backward overhead medicine ball throw (SBOMBT); (6) seated chest pass throw (SCPT) with a 3-kg rubber medicine ball; and (7) hand-grip test. Additionally, saliva samples were collected from each participant. Genotyping analysis was carried out by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results: No significant differences were found in sport performance of subjects after 50 Hz-tACS. Additionally, we did not find any influence of genetic background on tACS-related effect on physical performance. These results suggest that tACS at gamma frequency is not able to induce an after-effect modulating sport performance. Further investigations with larger sample size are needed in order to understand the potential role of non-invasive brain stimulation techniques (NIBS) in motor performances. Conclusions: Gamma-tACS applied before the physical performance fails to improve explosive power in sport subjects.","Giustiniani, Andreina; Battaglia, Giuseppe; Messina, Giuseppe; Morello, Hely; Guastella, Salvatore; Iovane, Angelo; Oliveri, Massimiliano; Palma, Antonio; Proia, Patrizia",Front Hum Neurosci,122,1

The processed product of dried root of Aconitum carmichaeli Debeaux (Aconiti Radix cocta, ARC) is used often in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) to treat GA, but its specific active components and mechanism of action are not clear. Methods: First, we used ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole/time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry to identify the chemical spectrum of ARC. Based on this result, we explored the active components of ARC in GA treatment and their potential targets and pathways. Simultaneously, we used computer simulations, in vitro cell experiments and animal experiments to verify the prediction results of systems pharmacology. In vitro, we used aurantiamide acetate (AA) to treat monosodium urate (MSU)-stimulated THP-1 cells and demonstrated the reliability of the prediction by western blotting and real-time reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). ELISAs kit were used to measure changes in levels of proinflammatory factors in rats with GA induced by MSU to demonstrate the efficacy of ARC in GA treatment. Results: Forty-three chemical constituents in ARC were identified. ARC could regulate 65 targets through 29 active components, and then treat GA, which involved 1427 Gene Ontology (GO) terms and 146 signaling pathways. Signaling pathways such as proteoglycans in cancer, C-type lectin receptor signaling pathway, and TNF signaling pathway may have an important role in GA treatment with ARC. In silico results showed that the active components songoramine and ignavine had high binding to mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 alpha (MAPK14) and matrix metallopeptidase (MMP)9, indicating that ARC treatment of GA was through multiple components and multiple targets. In vitro experiments showed that AA in ARC could effectively reduce expression of MAPK14, MMP9, and cyclooxygenase2 (PTGS2) in THP-1 cells stimulated by MSU, whereas it could significantly inhibit the mRNA expression of Caspase-1, spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK), and PTGS2. Animal experiments showed that a ARC aqueous extract could significantly reduce expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and intereleukin (IL)-18 in the serum of GA rats stimulated by MSU. Hence, ARC may inhibit inflammation by regulating the proteoglycans in cancer-associated signaling pathways. Conclusion: ARC treatment of GA may have the following mechanisms, ARC can reduce MSU crystal-induced joint swelling, reduce synovial tissue damage, and reduce the expression of inflammatory factors in serum. AA in ARC may inhibit inflammation by regulating the protein expression of MAPK14, MMP9, and PTGS2 and the mRNA expression of caspase-1, SYK, and PTGS2.","Ye, Xietao; Wu, Jianxiong; Zhang, Dayong; Lan, Zelun; Yang, Songhong; Zhu, Jing; Yang, Ming; Gong, Qianfeng; Zhong, Lingyun",Front Pharmacol,122,1

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the implementation of virtual outpatient clinics was crucial, for continued service provision despite social distancing guidelines. We aimed to ascertain patient satisfaction with virtual clinics in cardiothoracic surgery. METHOD: Forty patients who attended virtual clinics, post cardiothoracic surgery, were invited to provide feedback by means of a questionnaire. Feedback was gathered by junior doctors. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients (20 had never had a telephone clinic appointment) agreed to provide feedback. Fifty percent of patients had not been seen since their operation. 91.2% (n = 31) of patients felt that the telephone consultation met their expectations/needs. Patient reported advantages of telephone consultations included: less concern regarding exposure to infection, no concern regarding parking, no travel time and less time off work. 79.4% (n = 27) would have preferred a face-to-face appointment. Patient reported disadvantages of telephone consultations were poor reception, felt they weren’t listened to and would have preferred to have been physically examined. CONCLUSIONS: Patients were satisfied with telephone clinics for routine follow up post cardiothoracic surgery.

We study popular attitudes toward the distribution of COVID‐19 vaccines and how these have changed over the course of the pandemic in Switzerland, drawing on data from two rounds of an original public opinion survey conducted in the spring and winter of 2020. We find that the public supports prioritizing vulnerable groups such as health care workers or the elderly. We also find a notable degree of cross‐generational solidarity: younger age cohorts prioritize the elderly, while older groups prioritize (typically younger) health care workers. We then examine whether this finding is not in fact driven by vaccine hesitancy. This is not the case for older age groups, whose solidarity thus seems to be genuine.

Financial wellbeing is defined as having financial security and freedom of choice, in the present and in the future. This has a direct correlation to overall wellbeing: including productivity experienced at work, quality of relationship, quality of health and hence quality of life. Financial wellness is also challenging as everyone desires to achieve a state of wellness while the pathways to its achievement are not straightforward and can be easily overwhelming to many. In the Indian context, recent reports point to the fact that financial wellness emerges as a top stressor for a majority of people which has also heightened due to the pandemic. A lack of financial wellness thus emerges as a major problem in the country. The prevalence of concerns on financial wellness in fact, is witnessed across the globe. An approach to ameliorating this is through the field of behavioral finance which has uncovered many behavioral biases and barriers which impact how financial decisions are taken. Examples include lack of awareness of financial needs or awareness of the right products, lack of self-control, confusion in making financial choices or being unable to save/invest at the right time. To address this, we present a holistic and hyper-personalized approach that combines technology and behavioral science to influence financial behavior. The solution aims at enhancing financial wellness of individuals using behavioral levers and nudges. This combines two aspects: (1) an engaging user interface at the front-end and (2) a customer insights/behavioral analytics and intervention recommendation system at the back end that suggests appropriate hyper-personalized actionable steps to the user. The solution helps users to visualize their financial needs, set financial goals and receive appropriate personalized nudges to help them in implementing financial plans as they go through various phases of career/life stages.

However, the impact of PBC on the oral microbiota and contribution of the oral microbiota to PBC are unclear. In this study, thirty-nine PBC patients without other diseases and 37 healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled and tested for liver functions and haematological variables. Saliva specimens were collected before and after brushing, microbiota was determined using 16S rDNA sequencing, metabolomics was profiled using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS), 80 cytokines were assayed using biochips, and inflammation inducibility was evaluated using OKF6 keratinocytes and THP-1 macrophages. Finally, the effect of ultrasonic scaling on PBC was estimated. Compared with HCs, PBC saliva had enriched taxa such as Bacteroidetes, Campylobacter, Prevotella and Veillonella and depleted taxa such as Enterococcaceae, Granulicatella, Rothia and Streptococcus. PBC saliva also had enriched sCD163, enriched metabolites such as 2-aminomalonic acid and 1-dodecanol, and depleted metabolites such as dodecanoic acid and propylene glycol. sCD163, 4-hydroxybenzeneacetic acid and 2-aminomalonic acid were significantly correlated with salivary cytokines, bacteria and metabolites. Salivary Veillonellaceae members, 2-aminomalonic acid, and sCD163 were positively correlated with liver function indicators such as serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). PBC salivary microbes induced more soluble interleukin (IL)-6 receptor α (sIL-6Rα), sIL-6Rβ and tumour necrosis factor ligand superfamily (TNFSF)13B from OKF6 keratinocytes, and PBC salivary supernatant induced more IL-6, IL-10, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), chemokine (C-C motif) ligand (CCL)13, C-X-C motif chemokine (CXC)L1 and CXCL16 from THP-1 macrophages. Toothbrushing significantly reduced the expression of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-8 and TNF-α and harmful metabolites such as cadaverine and putrescine in PBC but not HC saliva after P‐value correction.

This article investigates how multilateral diplomats, who understand themselves as bringing people and polities together, cope with and resist the move to online settings, replacing handshakes with touchless greetings in videoconferences. Our starting point is the Covid-19 pandemic, but the article theorizes the effects of digital technological mediation already under way years before. Translating Knorr Cetina's notion of “synthetic situation” into the discipline of international relations (IR), we address how the very composition of diplomatic interaction is undergoing transformation. Building on immersive and remote fieldwork, among ambassadors, attachés, interpreters, and journalists constituting the field of European Union diplomacy, our argument speaks to IR debates on international practice, face-to-face interactions, digital technologies, and the political sociology of diplomacy. We show how practicing diplomacy online and with restrictions on in-person meetings involves (re)constructions of its dramaturgy, props, symbols, and authenticity as well as “heroic” fantasies of duty and exceptionalism; we analyze how diplomacy is practiced in “screen worlds” through scopic media enabling “response presence” or virtual co-presence across geographic and professional/private sites; and we trace how resistance to syntheticism emerges as screen fatigue spreads. Overall, we find that the pandemic has accelerated the ongoing transformation of diplomacy from “naked” face-to-face interactions to digitally mediated “synthetic situations,” producing new interpretations of who is “essential” in diplomacy. We conclude by questioning the term “digital diplomacy,” suggesting that virtual practices are in fact not simply “online” but embodied offline, and sometimes actively resisted. In the screen world, diplomats’ bodies (and home offices) become key sites of IR. ¿Qué sucede con los encuentros diplomáticos cuando son mediados de manera digital?

Nuestro punto de partida es la pandemia de COVID-19, pero el artículo teoriza los efectos de la mediación tecnológica digital que ya se viene viendo desde hace unos años. Trasladando la noción de “situación sintética,” propuesta por Knorr Cetina, a la disciplina de Relaciones Internaciones, abordamos cómo la composición de la interacción diplomática está experimentando una transformación.

En general, descubrimos que la pandemia ha acelerado la transformación de la diplomacia, que ya se venía dando, pasando de ser interacciones cara a cara “desnudas” a “situaciones sintéticas” mediadas digitalmente, lo que da lugar a generar nuevas interpretaciones de quién es “esencial” en la diplomacia. Concluimos cuestionando el término “diplomacia digital” y sugerimos que las prácticas virtuales no son simplemente “en línea,” sino que se materializan fuera de línea y, a veces, el mundo se resiste a ellas activamente.

We further analyzed the involvement of toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and explored the activation of signaling pathway enzymes in response to LPG stimulation. During the stimulation of neutrophils by LPG, the blockade using anti-TLR2 and anti-TLR4 antibodies reduced the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), the release of DNA from the NETs, and the burst of ROS. Moreover, the addition of JNK inhibitor and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase inhibitor exhibited similar effects.

This occurs due to, and further enhances, viral immune evasion and survival. Since the discovery of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which manifests in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a great number of studies have described the association between this virus and pathologically increased or decreased immune cell counts. In this review, we consider the absolute and relative changes to innate and adaptive immune cell numbers, in COVID-19. In severe disease particularly, neutrophils are increased, which can lead to inflammation and tissue damage. Dysregulation of other granulocytes, basophils, and eosinophils represent an unusual COVID-19 phenomenon. Contrastingly, the impact on the different types of monocytes leans more strongly to an altered phenotype, e.g. HLA-DR expression, rather than numerical changes. However, it is the adaptive immune response which bears the most profound impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection. T cell lymphopenia correlates with increased risk of ICU admission and death; therefore, this parameter is particularly important for clinical decision making. Mild and severe disease differ in the rate of immune cell counts returning to normal levels post disease. Tracking the recovery trajectories of various immune cell counts may also have implications for long-term COVID-19 monitoring. This review represents a snapshot of our current knowledge, showing that much has been achieved in a short period of time. Alterations in counts of distinct immune cells represent an accessible metric to inform patient care decision or predict disease outcomes.","Codd, Amy S; Hanna, Stephanie J; Compeer, Ewoud B; Richter, Felix C; Pring, Eleanor J; Gea-Mallorquí, Ester; Borsa, Mariana; Moon, Owen R; Scourfield, D Oliver; Gallimore, Awen M; Milicic, Anita",Oxf Open Immunol,122,1

Little is known about the visual behavior of health professionals using these ventilation modes. The aim of this study was to analyze gaze patterns of intensive care nurses while ventilating a patient in the closed-loop mode with Intellivent adaptive support ventilation® (I-ASV) and to compare inexperienced with experienced nurses. Materials and Methods: Intensive care nurses underwent eye-tracking during daily care of a patient ventilated in the closed-loop ventilation mode. Five specific areas of interest were predefined (ventilator settings, ventilation curves, numeric values, oxygenation Intellivent, ventilation Intellivent). The main independent variable and primary outcome was dwell time. Secondary outcomes were revisits, average fixation time, first fixation and fixation count on areas of interest in a targeted tracking-time of 60 min. Gaze patterns were compared between I-ASV inexperienced (n = 12) and experienced (n = 16) nurses. Results: In total, 28 participants were included. Overall, dwell time was longer for ventilator settings and numeric values compared to the other areas of interest. Similar results could be obtained for the secondary outcomes. Visual fixation of oxygenation Intellivent and ventilation Intellivent was low. However, dwell time, average fixation time and first fixation on oxygenation Intellivent were longer in experienced compared to inexperienced intensive care nurses. Discussion: Gaze patterns of intensive care nurses were mainly focused on numeric values and settings. Areas of interest related to traditional mechanical ventilation retain high significance for intensive care nurses, despite use of closed-loop mode. More visual attention to oxygenation Intellivent and ventilation Intellivent in experienced nurses implies more routine and familiarity with closed-loop modes in this group. The findings imply the need for constant training and education with new tools in critical care, especially for inexperienced professionals.","Buehler, Philipp K.; Herling, Anique; Bienefeld, Nadine; Klinzing, Stephanie; Wegner, Stephan; Wendel Garcia, Pedro David; Karbach, Michael; Lohmeyer, Quentin; Schaubmayr, Elisabeth; Schuepbach, Reto A.; Hofmaenner, Daniel A.",Front Med (Lausanne),122,23

Treatment of refractory IBS patients is needed, but it is not yet widely available. Therefore, we previously developed a Japanese version of cognitive behavioral therapy with interoceptive exposure (CBT-IE) involving 10 face-to-face sessions to treat refractory IBS patients. To disseminate this treatment of IBS in places where therapists are limited, we further developed a hybrid CBT-IE program with complementary video materials that include psychoeducation and homework instructions so that patients can prepare for face-to-face sessions in advance at home and the session time can be shortened, thereby reducing the burden on both patient and therapist. In this study, we conducted a trial to evaluate the feasibility, efficacy, and safety of the hybrid CBT-IE program for Japanese IBS patients. The study was a single-arm, open-label pilot clinical trial. A total of 16 IBS patients were included in the study and 14 patients completed the intervention, which consisted of 10 weekly individual hybrid CBT-IE sessions. We performed an intention to treat analysis. The primary outcome measure for the efficacy of the intervention was a decrease in the severity of IBS symptoms. The feasibility and safety of the intervention were examined by the dropout rate and recording of adverse events, respectively. The dropout rate of the hybrid CBT-IE was comparable to that of our previous CBT-IE with only face-to-face sessions and no adverse events were recorded. The severity of IBS symptoms within-group was significantly decreased from the baseline to mid-treatment [Hedges' g = −0.98 (−1.54, −0.41)], post-treatment [Hedges' g = −1.48 (−2.09, −0.88)], 3-month follow-up [Hedges' g = −1.78 (−2.41, −1.14)], and 6-month follow-up [Hedges' g = −1.76 (−2.39, −1.13)]. Our results suggest that the hybrid CBT-IE is effective and could be conducted safely. To confirm the effectiveness of the hybrid CBT-IE, it is necessary to conduct a multicenter, parallel-design randomized control trial.

A study from 2015 demonstrated that the potency of the Nobivac(®) Rabies vaccine was not impacted following experimental storage at 30°C for 3 months. Whether the vaccine would remain efficacious following storage under more natural, fluctuating temperature conditions remains unknown. We carried out a randomised controlled non-inferiority trial to compare serological responses in dogs following vaccination with doses stored under cold chain conditions with those stored within a locally made Passive Cooling Device (“Zeepot”) under fluctuating temperature conditions. Materials and Methods: Nobivac(®) Rabies vaccine was stored under either cold-chain conditions or within the Zeepot for 2 months. Daily ambient temperatures and temperatures within the Zeepot were recorded every 3 h. Following storage, 412 domestic dogs were randomly assigned to receive either cold-chain or Zeepot stored Nobivac(®) Rabies vaccine. Baseline and day 28-post vaccination blood samples were collected. Serological analysis using the Fluorescent Antibody Virus Neutralisation assay was carried out with a threshold of 0.5 IU/ml to determine seroconversion. In addition, the impact of dog Body Condition Score, sex, and age on seroconversion was examined. Results: The serological response of dogs vaccinated using Nobivac(®) Rabies vaccine stored within the Zeepot was not inferior to the response of dogs vaccinated using cold-chain stored vaccine (z = 1.1, df = 313, p-value = 0.25). Indeed, the 28-day post-vaccination group geometric mean titre was 1.8 and 2.0 IU/ml for cold-chain vs. non-cold-chain storage, respectively. Moreover, the percentage of dogs that seroconverted in each arm was almost identical (85%). There was a positive linear trend between Body Condition Score (O.R. 2.2, 95% CI: 1.1–5.1) and seroconversion, suggesting dogs of poor condition may not respond as expected to vaccination. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated the potency of Nobivac(®) Rabies vaccine is not impacted following storage under elevated fluctuating temperatures within a Zeepot. These results have potentially exciting applications for scaling up mass dog vaccination programmes in low-and-middle income countries, particularly for hard-to-reach populations with limited access to power and cold-chain vaccine storage.","Lugelo, Ahmed; Hampson, Katie; Czupryna, Anna; Bigambo, Machunde; McElhinney, Lorraine M.; Marston, Denise A.; Kazwala, Rudovick; Lankester, Felix",Front Vet Sci,122,16

In addition to improved utilisation of oral anticoagulants (OACs) for stroke prevention, reports of switching among OACs are growing in the literature; switching may influence clinical outcomes, healthcare costs and patient satisfaction. This review aimed to summarise the current literature on the pattern of OAC switching in patients with AF, including reasons for switching and clinical consequences following switching. A literature search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, and Embase on Jun 27, 2020. We included 39 articles published after 2013, following the introduction of apixaban. The review found that switching among OACs was common in clinical practice, significantly varying with the type of OAC. Studies reporting the reason for switching and clinical outcomes were comparatively limited. The decision to switch was often related to safety issues (usually bleeding), poor anticoagulation control and ease-of-use. Patient characteristics, clinical conditions and drug interactions were found to be associated with switching from OACs. Findings regarding bleeding outcomes following switching were inconsistent, possibly confounded by the rationale for switching and the switching protocol. Noting the limited number of studies included and their relatively short follow-up periods, switching did not have a significant impact on the risk of stroke and other thrombotic outcomes. Further prospective studies are needed to understand better potential rationales for switching and the clinical outcomes.","Kefale, Adane Teshome; Peterson, Gregory M; Bezabhe, Woldesellassie M; Bereznicki, Luke R",British journal of clinical pharmacology,122,1

METHODS Secondary analysis of 46 interviews with people affected by motor neurone disease in the United Kingdom (35 individuals with the condition, 11 carers). RESULTS Metaphor and figurative language was used to communicate the intensely emotional experiences of being diagnosed with and living with motor neurone disease. We focus on three pervasive themes that were threaded throughout the interviews: battling and fighting; the self under attack and journeying through a physical and emotional landscape. DISCUSSION This secondary analysis of qualitative research interviews enriches our understanding of the articulation of emotion in motor neurone disease and adds to the literature on metaphor in chronic illness. Of particular interest is how the metaphors used contrasted with other conditions in the relative absence of metaphors of 'fighting' the disease. Furthermore, we analyse the ways in which participants used metaphors to give voice to emotions that are extremely difficult to articulate in 'literal' language, and how, in doing so, they blurred the distinction between 'physical' symptoms and 'emotional' states. Sensitivity to metaphors may help professionals communicate with people affected by motor neurone disease.","Locock, Louise; Mazanderani, Fadhila; Powell, John",Chronic illness,122,15

Owing to the evolution in laparoscopic technology and instrumentation within the past decade, laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy is beginning to gain wider acceptance. METHODS Data were collected for all patients who underwent a TLPD at our institution. Preoperative evaluation consisted of computed tomography scan with pancreatic protocol and selective use of magnetic resonance imaging and/or endoscopic ultrasonography. The TLPD was done with 6 ports on 3 patients and 5 ports in 2 patients and included a celiac, periportal, peripancreatic, and periduodenal lymphadenectomy. Pancreatic stents were used in all 5 cases, and intestinal continuity was re-established by intracorporeal anastomoses. RESULTS Five patients underwent a TLPD for suspicion of a periampullary tumor. There were 3 women and 2 men with a mean age of 60 years and a mean body mass index of 32.8. Intraoperatively, the mean operative time was 9 hours 48 minutes, with a mean blood loss of 136 mL. Postoperatively, there were no complications and a mean length of stay of 6.6 days. There was no lymph node involvement in 4 out of 5 specimens. The pathological results included intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm in 2 patients, pancreatic adenocarcinoma in 1 patient (R0 resection), benign 4-cm periampullary adenoma in 1 patient, and a somatostatin neuroendocrine carcinoma in 1 patient (R0, N1). CONCLUSION TLPD is a viable alternative to the standard Whipple procedure. Our early experience suggests decreased length of stay, quicker recovery, and improved quality of life.

All 9 patients underwent CT and MR imaging. Five lipogranulomas were located in the right eyelid and 4 in the left eyelid, which extended into the extraconal space to some degree. The lesions displayed an irregular shape and had an ill-defined margin. Multiple, specked, or nodular foci containing fat were scattered within these lesions. The lesions demonstrated moderate heterogeneous contrast enhancement on contrast-enhanced MR imaging. The TICs showed a persistent pattern (type I) in 6 patients undergoing DCE MR imaging. Thus, an ill-defined, irregular-shaped periorbital mass with multiple foci containing fat, combined with an ESS history, can help to accurately diagnose this entity.","Yang, B T; Liu, Y J; Wang, Y Z; Wang, X Y; Wang, Z C",AJNR.

Each olfactory receptor neuron projects a dendrite into the nasal cavity on the apical side, and on the basal side extends its axon through the cribriform plate into the olfactory bulb of the brain. Viruses that can use the olfactory nerve as a shortcut into the CNS include influenza A virus, herpesviruses, poliovirus, paramyxoviruses, vesicular stomatitis virus, rabies virus, parainfluenza virus, adenoviruses, Japanese encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, chikungunya virus, La Crosse virus, mouse hepatitis virus, and bunyaviruses. However, mechanisms of transport via the olfactory nerve and subsequent spread through the CNS are poorly understood. Proposed mechanisms are either infection of olfactory receptor neurons themselves or diffusion through channels formed by olfactory ensheathing cells. Subsequent virus spread through the CNS could occur by multiple mechanisms, including trans-synaptic transport and microfusion. Viral infection of the CNS can lead to damage from infection of nerve cells per se, from the immune response, or from a combination of both.

They are characterized by a pseudocyclic backbone with two to four prolines and three disulfides arranged in a knotted motif. Similar to other knottins, cystine knot α-amylase inhibitors are highly resistant to degradation by heat and protease treatments. Thus far, only the α-amylase inhibition activity has been described for members of this family. Here, we show that cystine knot α-amylase inhibitors named alstotides discovered from the Alstonia scholaris plant of the Apocynaceae family display antiviral activity. The alstotides (As1-As4) were characterized by both proteomic and genomic methods. All four alsotides are novel, heat-stable and enzyme-stable and contain 30 residues. NMR determination of As1 and As4 structures reveals their conserved structural fold and the presence of one or more cis-proline bonds, characteristics shared by other cystine knot α-amylase inhibitors. Genomic analysis showed that they contain a three-domain precursor, an arrangement common to other knottins. We also showed that alstotides are antiviral and cell-permeable to inhibit the early phase of infectious bronchitis virus and Dengue infection, in addition to their ability to inhibit α-amylase. Taken together, our results expand membership of cystine knot α-amylase inhibitors in the Apocynaceae family and their bioactivity, functional promiscuity that could be exploited as leads in developing therapeutics.","Nguyen, Phuong Quoc Thuc; Ooi, Justin Seng Geap; Nguyen, Ngan Thi Kim; Wang, Shujing; Huang, Mei; Liu, Ding Xiang; Tam, James P",The Journal of biological chemistry,122,14

Studies have reported higher levels of depression, anxiety, insomnia, stress, distress, fear, burnout, and post-traumatic symptoms. OBJECTIVE This research aimed to explore the psychological impacts of COVID 19 on paramedicine students. METHODS A convergent mixed method design study was undertaken using self-reporting instruments and qualitative interviews. RESULTS Responses were received from 151 students (38.3% responses rate). Most students experienced some level of anxiety (62%), although severe levels were only reported by 6% of respondents. Students had significantly greater odds (OR = 2.05, p = 0.045, 95% CI: 1.02, 4.12) of higher anxiety levels if they were female. Thematic analysis of the interviews largely supported these results, with themes focused on changing approaches to study, financial situation, social support, University adaptation, acceptance and career pathway choice. CONCLUSIONS This study identified and explored the anxiety and coping strategies in an undergraduate paramedicine cohort when faced with a viral epidemic. Although most of the responding paramedic students reported above normal levels of anxiety in the initial stages of the COVID-19 outbreak, many students, with the help of learning, financial and social support, and a range of positive coping strategies, have adapted well to the impact of the pandemic and associated lockdown period.","Brett Williams,; King, Christine; Shannon, Brendan; Gosling, Cameron",International emergency nursing,122,16

METHODS All patients treated with EVT (intra-arterial thrombolysis (IAT), mechanical thrombectomy (MT) or both, or an attempt at intervention) for acute stroke at UHNS, Stoke-on-Trent, UK, were entered into a prospective register. Baseline demographic and clinical data, the National Institutes for Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), imaging results including Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) score, and complications were recorded. Mortality, and modified Rankin score (mRS) were assessed at 90 days. RESULTS From December 2009 to January 2013 106 patients (mean age 64 years, median baseline NIHSS 18) were treated with EVT (thrombectomy ± IAT 83%, IAT alone 13%, neither 4%). Seventy-eight per cent of occlusions were in the anterior circulation. Intravenous bridging thrombolysis was performed in 81%. Revascularization was successful (TICI 2b/3) in 84%.

Under the auspices of the Canadian Association of Medical Oncologists, we conducted an online national survey to better understand the impact of the pandemic on the medical oncology community in Canada. Methods An English-language multiple-choice survey, including questions about demographics, covid-19 risk, use of personal protective equipment (ppe), personal challenges, and chemotherapy management was distributed to Canadian medical oncologists. The survey was open from 30 March to 4 April 2020, and attracted 159 responses. Results More than 70% of medical oncologists expressed moderate-to-extreme concern about personally contracting covid-19 and about family members or patients (or both) contracting covid-19 from them. Despite that high level of concern, considerable variability in the use of ppe in direct cancer care was reported at the time of this survey, with 33% of respondents indicating no routine ppe use at their institutions and 69% indicating uncertainty about access to adequate ppe. Of the respondents, 54% were experiencing feelings of nervousness or anxiety on most days, and 52% were having feelings of depression or hopelessness on at least some days. Concern about aging parents or family and individual wellness represented the top personal challenges identified. The management of cancer patients has been affected, with adoption of telemedicine reported by 82% of respondents, and cessation of clinical trial accrual reported by 54%. The 3 factors deemed most important for treatment decision-making were■ cancer prognosis and anticipated benefit from treatment,■ risk of treatment toxicity during scarce health care access, and■ patient risk of contracting covid-19. Conclusions This report describes the results of the first national survey assessing the impact of the covid-19 on Canadian medical oncologists and how they deliver systemic anticancer therapies. We hope that these data will provide a framework to address the challenges identified.","Gill, S; Hao, D; Hirte, H; Campbell, A; Colwell, B",Current oncology,122,12

To date, the impact of G-quadruplex (G4) regulation in neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease (PD) has not been analysed. In this study, in silico potential G4s located in deregulated genes related to the nervous system were initially identified and were found to be significantly enriched. Several G4 sequences found in the 5' untranslated regions (5'UTR) of mRNAs associated with Parkinson's disease were demonstrated to in fact fold in vitro by biochemical assays. Subcloning of the full-length 5'UTRs of these candidates upstream of a luciferase reporter system led to the demonstration that the G4s of both Parkin RBR E3 Ubiquitin Protein Ligase (PRKN) and Vacuolar Protein Sorting-Associated Protein 35 (VPS35) significantly repressed the translation of both genes in SH-SY5Y cells. Subsequently, a strategy of using label-free RNA affinity purification assays with either of these two G4 sequences as bait isolated the Guanine Nucleotide-Binding Protein-Like 1 (GNL1).

Secondary attack rate in household members was 53% (125 cases), and symptomatic individuals accounted for 77.6% of cases (symptomatic/asymptomatic ratio: 3.5). Presence of fever and/or chills was found in 40% of persons with positive test results, followed by sore throat with 39.2%. Ageusia and anosmia were present in 22.4% and 20.8% of cases, respectively. When there was a primary case of COVID-19 in the household, the secondary attack rate was 53%; however, in an important proportion of households there were no positive cases other than the primary case. The epidemiological and clinical findings were consistent with reports from other international series.","Angulo-Bazán, Yolanda; Solis-Sánchez, Gilmer; Cardenas, Fany; Jorge, Ana; Acosta, Joshi; Cabezas, César",Cadernos de saude publica,122,10

Friedrich Bootz].,14.487743,4.8927264,2021-02-15,"Owing to human activities, a large number of organic chemicals including petroleum products, industrial solvents, pesticides, herbicides (including atrazine [ATR]), and pharmaceuticals contaminate soil and aquatic environments. Remediation of these pollutants by conventional approaches is both technically and economically challenging. Bacillus endospores are highly resistant to most physical assaults and are capable of long-term persistence in soil. Spores can be engineered to express on their surface important enzymes for bioremediation purposes. We have developed a Bacillus thuringiensis spore platform system that can display a high density of proteins on the spore surface. The spore surface-tethered enzymes exhibit enhanced activity and stability relative to free enzymes in soil and water environments. In this study, we evaluated a Bacillus thuringiensis spore-display platform as a bioremediation tool against ATR. The Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP atzA determinant, an ATR chlorohydrolase important to the detoxification of ATR, was expressed as a fusion protein linked to the attachment domain of the BclA spore surface nap layer protein and expressed in B. thuringiensis Spores from this strain are decorated with AtzA N-terminally linked on the surface of the spores. The recombinant spores were assayed for ATR detoxification in liquid and soil environments and enzyme kinetics and stability were assessed. We successfully demonstrated the utility of this spore-based enzyme display system to detoxify ATR in water and laboratory soil samples.IMPORTANCEAtrazine is one of the most widely applied herbicides in the U.S. Midwestern states. The long environmental half-life of atrazine has contributed to the contamination of surface and ground water by atrazine and its chlorinated metabolites. The toxic properties of ATR have raised public health and ecological concerns. However, remediation of ATR by conventional approaches has proven to be costly and inefficient. We developed a novel B. thuringiensis spore platform system that is capable of long-term persistence in soil and can be engineered to surface express a high density of enzymes useful for bioremediation purposes. The enzymes are stably attached to the surface of the spore exosporium layer. The spore-based system will likely prove useful for remediation of other environmental pollutants, as well.","Hsieh, Hsin-Yeh; Lin, Chung-Ho; Hsu, Shu-Yu; Stewart, George C",Applied and environmental microbiology,122,31

Drugs that enhance the activity of dorsal horn α2/α3GABAARs normalize exaggerated nociceptive responses in rodents with neuropathic nerve lesions or peripheral inflammation but lack most of the typical side effects of less specific GABAergic drugs. It is however still unknown whether such drugs also reduce the clinically more relevant conscious perception of pain. Here, we investigated the effects of the α2/α3GABAAR subtype-selective modulator TPA023B on the tonic aversive component of pain in mice with peripheral inflammation or neuropathy. In neuropathic mice with a chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve, TPA023B not only reversed hyperalgesia to tactile and heat stimuli, but was also highly effective in the conditioned place preference test. In the formalin test, TPA023B not only reduced licking of the injected paw but also reversed facial pain expression scores in the mouse grimace scale assay. Taken together, our results demonstrate that α2/α3GABAA receptor subtype-selective modulators not only reduce nociceptive withdrawal responses but also alleviate the tonic aversive components of chronic pain.","Neumann, Elena; Küpfer, Laura; Zeilhofer, Hanns Ulrich",Pain,122,22

Cathasept (tetra-sodium EDTA) solution has antimicrobial and anticoagulant activities. STUDY DESIGN Multicenter prospective randomized controlled study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS 117 maintenance HD patients with confirmed uncolonized tunneled HD catheters from 4 HD centers. INTERVENTION Patients were randomly assigned to receive Cathasept 4% locks (Cathasept group) or stayed with heparin 5,000 U/mL locks (heparin group), filled thrice weekly according to catheter lumen volume until the catheter was removed or for a maximum of 8 months. OUTCOMES Primary outcome was clinically significant microbial colonization of the catheter, defined as a through-catheter quantitative blood culture yielding ≥ 1,000 colony-forming units/mL of bacteria or yeast. Secondary outcomes included CRBSI rate, catheter patency, and biomarkers of inflammation and anemia. MEASUREMENTS Weekly through-catheter quantitative blood culture, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein fortnightly, and full blood count and ferritin monthly. RESULTS Incidence rates of catheter colonization were 0.14/1,000 catheter-days in the Cathasept group and 1.08/1,000 catheter-days in the heparin group (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.13; 95% CI, 0.003-0.94; P=0.02). CRBSI rates were 0.28/1,000 catheter-days in the Cathasept group and 0.68/1,000 catheter days in the heparin group (IRR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.08-2.09; P=0.3). The proportion of dialysis sessions with achieved prescribed blood flow rate was significantly lower in the Cathasept group (66.8% vs 75.3%; P<0.001), with more patients requiring thrombolytic locks or infusions to maintain catheter patency (22 vs 9; P=0.01). Mean high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level was 11.6±5.3 (SE) mg/L lower for patients in the heparin group (P=0.03). Anemia marker levels were similar in both groups. LIMITATIONS Study was underpowered to assess effect on CRBSI, terminated early due to slow recruitment, and not double blinded. CONCLUSIONS Cathasept significantly reduced tunneled hemodialysis catheter colonization, but the reduction in CRBSIs was not statistically significant, and it was associated with more thrombotic complications. Its safety profile was comparable to heparin lock solution.","Kanaa, Muhammad; Wright, Mark J; Akbani, Habib; Laboi, Paul; Bhandari, Sunil; Sandoe, Jonathan A T",American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation,122,2

The purpose of the present review is to outline the major considerations and challenges surrounding antenatal anesthetic evaluation. RECENT FINDINGS Data from the general surgical population would suggest a mortality benefit associated with preoperative anesthesia evaluation, although no such data exists in the obstetric population.Robust systems for case ascertainment and referral are needed. Recent publications on obstetric comorbidity indices may provide useful tools to ascertain high-risk parturients for a referral to antenatal obstetric anesthesiology clinics and higher levels of maternal care. Major obstetric organizations have identified and laid out criteria for maternal level of care. Anesthesiology resources also play a role in these designations and can help triage patients to facilities with appropriate resources.

METHODS In this cross-sectional study, we performed 24-hour ambulatory scalp EEGs on 43 cognitively normal elderly healthy controls (HC), 41 early-stage AD participants with no history or risk factors for epilepsy (AD-NoEp), and 15 early-stage AD participants with late-onset epilepsy related to AD (AD-Ep). Two epileptologists, blinded to diagnosis, visually reviewed all EEGs and annotated all potential epileptiform abnormalities. A panel of 9 epileptologists, blinded to diagnosis, was then surveyed to generate a consensus interpretation of epileptiform abnormalities in each EEG. RESULTS Epileptiform abnormalities were seen in 53% of AD-Ep, 22% of AD-NoEp, and 4.7% of HC participants. Specific features of epileptiform discharges, including high frequency, robust morphology, right temporal location, and occurrence during wakefulness and REM, were associated with clinical seizures in AD. Multiple electrical biomarkers concordantly demonstrated a pattern of left temporal lobe hyperexcitability in early stages of AD, whereas clinical seizures in AD were often associated with bi-temporal hyperexcitability. Frequent small sharp spikes were specifically associated with epileptiform EEGs and thus identified as a potential biomarker of hyperexcitability in AD. CONCLUSION Epileptiform abnormalities are common in AD, but not all equivalent. Specific features of epileptiform discharges are associated with clinical seizures in AD. Given the difficulty recognizing clinical seizures in AD, these EEG features could provide guidance on which AD patients are at high risk for clinical seizures.","Lam, Alice D; Sarkis, Rani A; Pellerin, Kyle R; Jing, Jin; Dworetzky, Barbara A; Hoch, Daniel B; Jacobs, Claire S; Lee, Jong Woo; Weisholtz, Daniel S; Zepeda, Rodrigo; Westover, M Brandon; Cole, Andrew J; Cash, Sydney S",Neurology,122,31

Among the various respiratory viruses, coronaviruses are important ubiquitous pathogens of humans and animals. Since the late 1960's, human coronaviruses (HCoV) are recognized pathogens of the upper respiratory tract, being mainly associated with mild pathologies such as the common cold. However, in vulnerable populations, (newborns, infants, the elderly and immune-compromised individuals), they can affect the lower respiratory tract, leading to pneumonia, exacerbations of asthma, respiratory distress syndrome or even severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). For almost three decades now, the scientific literature has also demonstrated that HCoV are neuroinvasive and neurotropic: neurons are often the target cell in the central nervous system (CNS), inducing neurodegeneration and eventually death. Moreover, HCoV can contribute to an overactivation of the immune system that could lead to autoimmunity in the CNS of susceptible individuals. Given all these properties, it has been suggested that HCoV could be associated with the triggering or the exacerbation of human neurological diseases for which the etiology remains unknown or poorly understood.","Desforges, Marc; Le Coupanec, Alain; Brison, Élodie; Meessen-Pinard, Mathieu; Talbot, Pierre J",Virologie,122,31

Herein, we sought to explore the anti-cancer mechanisms of ISL loaded nanoliposomes (ISL-NLs) on AMP-activated protein kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin (AMPK/mTOR) pathways mediated glycolysis. Also, the key targets such as caveolin 1 (CAV1), glucose transporters and Akt/mTOR that promote glycolysis, and are activated via the induction of α-enolase (ENO1), fructose bisphosphate aldolase A (ALDOA) and monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4) expressions were also investigated. It was shown that ISL-NLs significantly suppressed the proliferation and glucose uptake of CRC cell by potentially regulating the glycolysis and lactate targets as well as pathways that formed the basis of the anti-CRC effects of ISL-NLs. The mechanism underlying this effect was further validated via the regulation of some key targets such as ENO1, ALDOA, lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) and MCT4 in glycolysis coupled with cellular myelocytomatosis oncogene (c-myc), hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α) in protein kinase B/mTOR (Akt/mTOR) pathways. Moreover, the AMPK proteins were identified to be up-regulated while the lactic acid production was suppressed by ISL-NLs in the CRC cells, indicating that ISL-NLs had an inhibitory effect on AMPK mediated glycolysis and lactate production. Altogether, these results have provided insights into the mechanism underlying the key role that liposomal ISL played in the multiple inhibition of AMPK and Akt/mTOR mediated glycolysis and lactate generation, which may be regulated as the alternative metabolic pathways of CRC as well as serve as adjuvant therapy for the disease.","Wang, Gang; Yu, Yang; Wang, Yu-Zhu; Yin, Pei-Hao; Xu, Ke; Zhang, Heng","Artificial cells, nanomedicine, and biotechnology",122,1

However, it remains unclear whether patients can breathe independently at the PIC window and if NPPV is indeed necessary after extubation. OBJECTIVES To assess whether AECOPD patients can breathe independently at the PIC window and thus whether NPPV is necessary after extubation. METHODS We performed a prospective observational study at a university hospital during a 9-month period. We used the spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) to assess whether each patient could breathe independently at the PIC window, then performed extubation. Patients who passed the SBT received venturi oxygen therapy only, whereas those that failed received NPPV. However, if the former showed respiratory distress, they too received NPPV. The primary outcome variables were SBT pass/fail, the demand for NPPV and rate of reintubation within 72 h following extubation. RESULTS In all, 23 patients were enrolled, 15 (65%) of which passed the SBT. Of these, 12 (80%) developed respiratory distress after extubation and required NPPV (one of whom required reintubation). Of the eight patients that failed, one received reintubation after NPPV. The reintubation rates within 72 h following extubation of SBT-pass (7%) and SBT-fail (13%) patients were comparable. CONCLUSION Our results provide experimental evidence that most AECOPD patients can breathe independently at the PIC window, but nonetheless develop respiratory distress and thus require NPPV following extubation.","Luo, Zujin; Zhan, Qingyuan; Wang, Chen",The clinical respiratory journal,122,26

Patient characteristics, operative outcomes, and postoperative morbidities and mortalities were analyzed. RESULTS The median operative time and the intraoperative blood loss were 300 minutes and 72.5 g, respectively. Overall morbidity and mortality rates were 11.0% and 0%, respectively. Complications included wound infection (6.1%, n=5), anastomotic leakage (1.2%, n=1), ileus (1.2%, n=1), and pneumonia (2.4%, n=2).

STUDY DESIGN Controlled clinical trial. ANIMALS Female dogs (n=42). METHODS Dogs were divided into groups: 1=single portal and 2=2 portal. LapOVE was performed using a 5 mm vessel sealer/divider device and a 10 mm operating laparoscope (Group 1) or a 5 mm laparoscope (Group 2). Dog characteristics (weight, body condition score, ovarian ligament fat score), operative time, and perioperative complication rate were compared between groups. Right ovariectomy duration was evaluated for 2 novice laparoscopists. RESULTS No significant difference was found in mean total surgical time between group 1 (21.07 min/s) and group 2 (19.06 min/s). Factors significantly affecting times included body condition scores, ovarian ligament fat score, ovarian bleeding, and surgeon expertise. Minor complications (bleeding from ovaries or after splenic trauma) occurred and were similar in both groups. Bleeding was correlated to body condition score and ovarian ligament fat score. Interindividual differences were found among surgeons for right ovariectomy time. CONCLUSIONS Single portal access LapOVE using vessel sealer/divider device is feasible, safe, and does not significantly increase total surgical time in comparison with 2-portal approach.

Patients often complain of saliva pooling in the pharynx during NMES. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the changes in salivary flow during NMES. Material and Methods Twenty healthy adults participated in this study. Electrical stimulation was applied at constant strength for 60 minutes to the suprahyoid muscles using VitalStim®. Participants were examined under three conditions of NMES: sensory threshold plus 75% of the difference between sensory and pain thresholds (75% Stim), SensoryStim, and Sham. Saliva collections, using a 10-min spitting method, were performed seven times: before stimulation (S1), during stimulation (S2-S6), and 5 min after stimulation ended (S7).

DESIGN A physical assessment module focusing on vital signs was incorporated into the curriculum for third-year pharmacy students. This module consisted of an online component, a practical skills workshop, and a clinical practice site. ASSESSMENT The mean score on the in-class quiz, which evaluated students' knowledge of physical assessment after completion of the online module, was 94%. During the practical skills laboratory, 48% of student-measured systolic blood pressure (BP) readings and 60% of student-measured diastolic BP readings were within 5 mmHg of the machine reading. In the assessment of blood pressure technique, areas of difficulty included detection of Korotkoff sounds; steady deflation of cuff; and hand-eye coordination. CONCLUSION Students more frequently underestimated systolic BP than the diastolic BP when compared to the automated machine readings. Findings from this study will be used to improve existing modules and evaluation methods on the physical assessment of vital signs.","Leong, Christine; Louizos, Christopher; Frankel, Grace; Ng, Sheila; Iacovides, Harris; Falk, Jamie; Dunford, Drena; Brink, Kelly; Kleiman, Nancy; Davis, Christine; Renaud, Robert",American journal of pharmaceutical education,122,12

However, few researches focused on exosomes derived from gingival fibroblasts (GFs) of IGF. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of exosomes derived from GFs of IGF (IGF-GFs) on the proliferation and apoptosis of normal gingival fibroblasts (N-GFs). METHODS Gingival fibroblasts were cultured and identified using immunocytochemistry. Exosomes were isolated with exosomes extraction kit and characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and flow cytometry. PKH67 labelling was further used to trace the intracellular distribution of the exosomes. And MTS assay was used to test the effective concentration and time course of IGF-GFs-derived exosomes. Furthermore, the expression of PCNA, Ki67, Bcl-2 and Bax in N-GFs were analyzed by qRT-PCR and western blot. RESULTS Exosomes were isolated from IGF-GFs, the identification of exosomes and gingival fibroblasts were successfully finished. Moreover, we found that N-GFs co-cultured with exosomes showed a great increase in PCNA and Bcl-2 levels, and a moderate increase in Ki67 levels. By contrast, the levels of Bax were significantly reduced. CONCLUSION These results suggest that exosomes derived from idiopathic gingival fibroma fibroblasts are involved in the regulation of gingival fibroblast proliferation and apoptosis.","Yin, Shunhui; Jia, Fengmei; Ran, Liquan; Xie, Liangkun; Wu, Zhiyao; Zhan, Yeming; Zhang, Yan; Zhang, Mingzhu",Oral diseases,122,1

Its generation can in turn be used to significantly improve the performance of PFO emission-layer-based light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Here, we report the generation of β-phase chain segments in a copolymer, 90F8:10BT, containing 90% 9,9-dioctylfluorene (F8) and 10% 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT) units and show that significant improvements in performance also ensue for LEDs with β-phase 90F8:10BT emission layers, generalizing the earlier PFO results. The β-phase was induced by both solvent vapor annealing and dipping copolymer thin films into a solvent/nonsolvent mixture. Subsequent absorption spectra show the characteristic fluorene β-phase peak at ∼435 nm, but luminescence spectra (∼530 nm peak) and quantum yields barely change, with the emission arising following efficient energy transfer to the lowest-lying excited states localized in the vicinity of the BT units. For ∼5% β-phase chain segment fraction relative to 0% β-phase, the LED luminance at 10 V increased by ∼25% to 5940 cd m-2, the maximum external quantum efficiency by ∼61 to 1.91%, and the operational stability from 64% luminance retention after 20 h of operation to 90%. Detailed studies addressing the underlying device physics identify a reduced hole injection barrier, higher hole mobility, correspondingly more balanced electron and hole charge transport, and decreased carrier trapping as the dominant factors. These results confirm the effectiveness of chain conformation control for fluorene-based homo- and copolymer device optimization.","Wang, Bingjun; Ye, Hao; Riede, Moritz; Bradley, Donal D C",ACS applied materials & interfaces,122,24

OBJECTIVES We investigated the epidemiology and clonal relatedness of vanB VREfm from the period 2015-19 and describe the application of a clone-specific vanB VREfm PCR assay for rapid and accurate detection of vanB VREfm in rectal screening samples. METHODS vanB VREfm were investigated using epidemiological data and WGS data. The SeqSphere+ software was used to analyse MLST and cgMLST, and de novo assemblies were annotated to determine insertion sites for the vanB transposon (Tn1549). A clone-specific vanB VREfm PCR assay was designed to detect the sequence bridging Tn1549 and the E. faecium chromosome (araA2) in the dominant cluster. RESULTS Two hundred and seventy-five vanB VREfm isolates were identified, of which 76% were identified in 2019. A dominant cluster (Cluster 1, n = 204, 74%), six minor clusters and 15 singletons were identified. All Cluster 1 isolates and six non-Cluster 1 isolates had Tn1549 integrated into araA2. In 2019, the PCR assay would have detected 92% of all rectal screening samples containing vanB VREfm. CONCLUSIONS vanB VREfm increased due to the introduction and nosocomial transmission of the successful Cluster 1. The clone-specific PCR assay detected vanB VREfm outbreak isolates in rectal screening samples rapidly and accurately.","Pinholt, Mette; Mollerup, Sarah; Boye, Kit; Worning, Peder; Holzknecht, Barbara Juliane; Nygaard, Sanne; Nielsen, Karen Leth; Hasman, Henrik; Roer, Louise; Hammerum, Anette M; Westh, Henrik; Schønning, Kristian",The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy,122,1

While these studies have the advantage of large-sample sizes, they are unable to quantify the cellular basis of structural or functional changes. In contrast, postmortem studies are well suited to explore subfield and cellular alterations, but low sample sizes and subject heterogeneity impede establishment of statistically significant differences. Here we use a meta-analytic approach to synthesize the extant literature of hippocampal subfield volume and cellular composition in schizophrenia patients and healthy control subjects. Following pre-registration (PROSPERO CRD42019138280), PubMed, Web of Science, and PsycINFO were searched using the term: (schizophrenia OR schizoaffective) AND (post-mortem OR postmortem) AND hippocampus. Subjects were adult men and women with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder or non-psychiatric control subjects, and key outcomes, stratified by hippocampal hemisphere and subfield, were volume, neuron number, neuron density, and neuron size. A random effects meta-analysis was performed. Thirty-two studies were included (413 patients, 415 controls). In patients, volume and neuron number were significantly reduced in multiple hippocampal subfields in left, but not right hippocampus, whereas neuron density was not significantly different in any hippocampal subfield. Neuron size, averaged bilaterally, was also significantly reduced in all calculated subfields. Heterogeneity was minimal to moderate, with rare evidence of publication bias. Meta-regression of age and illness duration did not explain heterogeneity of total hippocampal volume effect sizes. These results extend neuroimaging findings of smaller hippocampal volume in schizophrenia patients and further our understanding of regional and cellular neuropathology in schizophrenia.","Roeske, Maxwell J; Konradi, Christine; Heckers, Stephan; Lewis, Alan S",Molecular psychiatry,122,16

The main pathogens are the same as in temperate climate zones: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, influenza viruses, Legionella pneumophila. However, some pulmonary diseases can be attributed to bacterial, parasitic, viral or fungal pathogens that are endemic in tropical and subtropical regions. The most commonly imported infections are malaria, dengue, and tuberculosis. Pulmonary symptoms and eosinophilia in returning travellers and migrants may be caused by several parasitic infections such as Katayama syndrome, Loeffler syndrome, tropical pulmonary eosinophilia, amebiasis, paragonimiasis, echinococcosis, and toxocariasis.

Cox regression analyses was used to investigate the risk factors of 28-day mortality in hospital. Of 263 patients, 161 (61.2%) were male, 62 (25.6%) had a known history of diabetes, and 135 (51.3%) experienced elevated FPG (> 7.0 mmol/L) at hospital admission.

Methods Eleven pediatric patients (aged 11 to 13) who inhaled the smoke of smoke bombs underwent several low-dose chest CT scans. The image characteristics and their dynamic changes were observed and quantitative CT values were analyzed. The quantitative CT indicators included lung injury CT score (LICTS), lung fibrosis CT score (LFCTS), mean lung density (MLD), normally aerated volume ratio (NAVR) and reductively aerated volume ratio (RAVR). Box-plot was used to analyze the dynamic changes of each indicator and Spearman statistical method was used to analyze the correlation between any two indicators. Results (I) In most cases, there were multiple consolidation and massive ground-glass opacities (GGOs) in the two lungs, which aggravated in the early stage and then gradually dissoluted in the later stage. LICTS was positively correlated with MLD (r=0.811, P=0.000), while it was negatively correlated with NAVR (r=-0.712, P=0.000). There existed interstitial fibrosis in the later stage, and LFCTS was positively correlated with RAVR (r=0.382, P=0.028). (II) In one case, the patterns were like layered cake, i.e., consolidation with air bronchus signs in the accumulation area, GGOs in the aforementioned area and normal lung in the top area. The patterns aggravated in the early stage and quickly dissolved in the later stage, and only a few residual fibrotic lesions existed on the final scan. (III) For severe cases, pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema aggravated in the early stage and then gradually dissolved in the later stage. Conclusions The chest CT manifestations of inhalation lung injury induced by smoke bombs are predominantly GGOs and consolidation. They aggravate in the early stage and gradual dissolute in the later stage. CT quantitative values can contribute to evaluating the extent of this disease, and NAVR and RAVR can be used to assess pulmonary function.","Ma, Yaqiong; Zhang, Shikui; Zhao, Lianping; Zhou, Xing; Mao, Zeqing; Xu, Huaxin; Ru, Xiaorui; Huang, Gang",Journal of thoracic disease,122,1

Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is the causative agent of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), characterized by reproductive failure in sows and respiratory diseases in pigs of different ages. To date, the sensing mechanism of PRRSV has not been elucidated. Here, we reported that the pseudoknot region residing in the 3' untranslated regions (UTR) of the PRRSV genome, which has been proposed to regulate RNA synthesis and virus replication, was sensed as nonself by retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) and strongly induced type I interferons (IFNs) and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs). The interaction between the two stem-loops inside the pseudoknot structure was sufficient for IFN induction, since disruption of the pseudoknot interaction powerfully dampened the IFN induction. Furthermore, transfection of the 3' UTR pseudoknot transcripts in PAMs inhibited PRRSV replication in vitro Importantly, the predicted similar structures of other arterivirus members, including equine arteritis virus (EAV), lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV), and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV), also displayed strong IFN induction activities. Together, in this work we identified an innate recognition mechanism by which the PRRSV 3' UTR pseudoknot region served as PAMPs of arteriviruses and activated innate immune signaling to produce IFNs that inhibit virus replication. All of these results provide novel insights into innate immune recognition during virus infection.IMPORTANCE PRRS is the most common viral disease in the pork industry. It is caused by PRRSV, a positive single-stranded RNA virus, whose infection often leads to persistent infection. To date, it is not yet clear how PRRSV is recognized by the host and what is the exact mechanism of IFN induction. Here, we investigated the nature of PAMPs on PRRSV and the associated PRRs. We found that the 3' UTR pseudoknot region of PRRSV, which has been proposed to regulate viral RNA synthesis, could act as PAMPs recognized by RIG-I and TLR3 to induce type I IFN production to suppress PRRSV infection. This report is the first detailed description of pattern recognition for PRRSV, which is important in understanding the antiviral response of arteriviruses, especially PRRSV, and extends our knowledge on virus recognition.","Xie, Sha; Chen, Xin-Xin; Qiao, Songlin; Li, Rui; Sun, Yangang; Xia, Shuangfei; Wang, Lin-Jian; Luo, Xuegang; Deng, Ruiguang; Zhou, En-Min; Zhang, Gai-Ping",Journal of virology,122,11

To date, research on IFN antagonism by hantaviruses is limited and has focused on only a subset of the numerous recognized hantavirus species. The host IFN response has two phases, an initiation phase, resulting in the induction of alpha/beta IFN (IFN-α/β), and an amplification phase, whereby IFN-α/β signals through the Jak/STAT pathway, resulting in the establishment of the cellular antiviral state. We examined interactions between these critical host responses and the New World hantaviruses. We observed delayed cellular responses in both Andes virus (ANDV)- and Sin Nombre virus (SNV)-infected A549 and Huh7-TLR3 cells. We found that IFN-β induction is inhibited by coexpression of ANDV nucleocapsid protein (NP) and glycoprotein precursor (GPC) and is robustly inhibited by SNV GPC alone. Downstream amplification by Jak/STAT signaling is also inhibited by SNV GPC and by either NP or GPC of ANDV. Therefore, ANDV- and SNV-encoded proteins have the potential for inhibiting both IFN-β induction and signaling, with SNV exhibiting the more potent antagonism ability. Herein we identify ANDV NP, a previously unrecognized inhibitor of Jak/STAT signaling, and show that IFN antagonism by ANDV relies on expression of both the glycoproteins and NP, whereas the glycoproteins appear to be sufficient for antagonism by SNV. These data suggest that IFN antagonism strategies by hantaviruses are quite variable, even between species with similar disease phenotypes, and may help to better elucidate species-specific pathogenesis.","Levine, Jessica R; Prescott, Joseph; Brown, Kyle S; Best, Sonja M; Ebihara, Hideki; Feldmann, Heinz",Journal of virology,122,16

As a baseline, an atlas-based method is implemented to which the results of the deep learning-based model are compared. METHODS A dataset consisting of 20 co-registered MR-CT pairs of the male pelvis is applied to assess the different sCT production methods' performance. The mean error (ME), mean absolute error (MAE), Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC), structural similarity index (SSIM), and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) metrics were computed between the estimated sCT and the ground truth (reference) CT images. RESULTS The visual inspection revealed that the sCTs produced by eCNN, V-Net, and ResNet, unlike the other methods, were less noisy and greatly resemble the ground truth CT image. In the whole pelvis region, the eCNN yielded the lowest MAE (26.03 ± 8.85 HU) and ME (0.82 ± 7.06 HU), and the highest PCC metrics were yielded by the eCNN (0.93 ± 0.05) and ResNet (0.91 ± 0.02) methods. The ResNet model had the highest PSNR of 29.38 ± 1.75 among all models. In terms of the Dice similarity coefficient, the eCNN method revealed superior performance in major tissue identification (air, bone, and soft tissue). CONCLUSIONS All in all, the eCNN and ResNet deep learning methods revealed acceptable performance with clinically tolerable quantification errors.","Bahrami, Abbas; Karimian, Alireza; Arabi, Hossein",Physica medica : PM : an international journal devoted to the applications of physics to medicine and biology : official journal of the Italian Association of Biomedical Physics,122,31

With inbreeding nearly complete, we estimated the extinction rate among CC lines at a remarkable 95%, which is substantially higher than in the derivation of other mouse recombinant inbred populations. Here, we report genome-wide allele frequencies in 347 extinct CC lines. Contrary to expectations, autosomes had equal allelic contributions from the eight founders, but chromosome X had significantly lower allelic contributions from the two inbred founders with underrepresented subspecific origins (PWK/PhJ and CAST/EiJ). By comparing extinct CC lines to living CC strains, we conclude that a complex genetic architecture is driving extinction, and selection pressures are different on the autosomes and chromosome X Male infertility played a large role in extinction as 47% of extinct lines had males that were infertile. Males from extinct lines had high variability in reproductive organ size, low sperm counts, low sperm motility, and a high rate of vacuolization of seminiferous tubules. We performed QTL mapping and identified nine genomic regions associated with male fertility and reproductive phenotypes. Many of the allelic effects in the QTL were driven by the two founders with underrepresented subspecific origins, including a QTL on chromosome X for infertility that was driven by the PWK/PhJ haplotype. We also performed the first example of cross validation using complementary CC resources to verify the effect of sperm curvilinear velocity from the PWK/PhJ haplotype on chromosome 2 in an independent population across multiple generations. While selection typically constrains the examination of reproductive traits toward the more fertile alleles, the CC extinct lines provided a unique opportunity to study the genetic architecture of fertility in a widely genetically variable population. We hypothesize that incompatibilities between alleles with different subspecific origins is a key driver of infertility. These results help clarify the factors that drove strain extinction in the CC, reveal the genetic regions associated with poor fertility in the CC, and serve as a resource to further study mammalian infertility.","Shorter, John R; Odet, Fanny; Aylor, David L; Pan, Wenqi; Kao, Chia-Yu; Fu, Chen-Ping; Morgan, Andrew P; Greenstein, Seth; Bell, Timothy A; Stevans, Alicia M; Feathers, Ryan W; Patel, Sunny; Cates, Sarah E; Shaw, Ginger D; Miller, Darla R; Chesler, Elissa J; McMillian, Leonard; O'Brien, Deborah A; Villena, Fernando Pardo-Manuel de",Genetics,122,5

This study used a convenience sampling technique to examine factors associated with misinformation about COVID-19 in sub-Saharan Africa using an online cross-sectional survey. A link to the online self-administered questionnaire was distributed to 1,969 participants through social media platforms and the authors' email networks. Four false statements-informed by results from a pilot study-were included in the survey. The participants' responses were classified as ""Agree,"" ""Neutral,"" and ""Disagree."" A multinomial logistic regression was used to examine associated factors. Among those who responded to the survey, 19.3% believed that COVID-19 was designed to reduce world population, 22.2% thought the ability to hold your breath for 10 seconds meant that you do not have COVID-19, 27.8% believed drinking hot water flushes down the virus, and 13.9% thought that COVID-19 had little effect on Blacks compared with Whites. An average of 33.7% were unsure whether the 4 false statements were true. Multivariate analysis revealed that those who thought COVID-19 was unlikely to continue in their countries reported higher odds of believing in these 4 false statements. Other significant factors associated with belief in misinformation were age (older adults), employment status (unemployed), gender (female), education (bachelor's degree), and knowledge about the main clinical symptoms of COVID-19. Strategies to reduce the spread of false information about COVID-19 and other future pandemics should target these subpopulations, especially those with limited education.

For those circumstances when invasive treatment is mandatory, endovascular techniques have grown to become the mainstay of practice, choice attributable to their reported safety and effectiveness. We describe the unique and rare case of a dural arteriovenous fistula treated by transarterial embolization and complicated by an intraventricular hemorrhage. We aim to emphasize some central aspects of the perioperative management of these patients in order to help improving the future approach of similar cases. CASE REPORT A 59-year-old woman with a previously diagnosed Cognard Type IV dural arteriovenous fistula presented for transarterial embolization, performed outside the operating room, under total intravenous anesthesia. The procedure underwent without complications and the intraoperative angiography revealed complete obliteration of the fistula. In the early postoperative period, the patient presented with clinical signs of raised intracranial pressure attributable to a later diagnosed intraventricular hemorrhage, which conditioned placement of a ventricular drain, admission to an intensive care unit, cerebral vasospasm and a prolonged hospital stay. Throughout the perioperative period, there were no changes in the cerebral brain oximetry. The patient was discharged without neurological sequelae. CONCLUSION Intraventricular hemorrhage may be a serious complication after the endovascular treatment of dural arteriovenous fistula. A close postoperative surveillance and monitoring allow an early diagnosis and treatment which increases the odds for an improved outcome.","de Carvalho, Joana Chaves Gonçalves Rodrigues; Machin, Francisco Javier Tercero; Manzanera, Luis San Roman; Andaluz, Jordi Blasco; Nogués, Sílvia Herrero; Soriano, Núria Peix; Baurier, Victor Obach; Carrero Cardenal, Enrique Jesus",Brazilian journal of anesthesiology,122,1

Jerk-based measures have been utilized to examine dynamic balance because of their ability to quantify changes in acceleration and may provide an understanding of the postural corrections that occur during stabilizing following a jumping task. The purpose of this study was to compare acceleration and jerk following a jump stabilization task between individuals with CAI and the uninjured controls. Thirty-nine participants volunteered to participate in this case control study. Participants completed a jump stabilization task requiring them to jump off 2 feet, touch a marker set at 50% of their maximal vertical jump height, land on a single limb, and maintain balance for 3 seconds. Acceleration was calculated as the second derivative, and jerk was calculated as the third derivative of the displacement of the resultant vector position. Participants with CAI had greater acceleration (mean difference = 55.6 cm/s2; 95% confidence interval, 10.3 to 100.90; P = .017) and jerk compared with the uninjured controls (mean difference = 1804.5 cm/s3; 95% confidence interval, 98.7 to 3510.3; P = .039).

Lung lesions are considered to be the main damage caused by SARSCoV-2 infection. In addition, liver injury has also been reported to occur during the course of the disease in severe cases. However, the effect of antiviral treatment on liver injury in critically ill patients is not yet clear. METHODS We retrospectively evaluated the effect of antiviral treatment and antiviral drug arbidol on liver injury in COVID-19 critically ill patients. Baseline characteristics were collected from patients who were admitted to intensive care units of Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China, and confounders were balanced by propensity score matching (PSM) and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) analyses. RESULTS Both the PSM (OR=2.77; 95% CI: 1.03, 7.48; P=0.045) and the IPTW-adjusted (OR=2.33; 95% CI: 1.02, 5.34; P=0.047) results showed that COVID-19 critically ill patients receiving antiviral treatment had a significantly higher risk of liver injury. However, arbidol treatment did not have a significant effect on liver injury (IPTW: OR=2.11; 95% CI: 0.79, 5.67; P=0.14). CONCLUSIONS Our results show that although arbidol treatment does not seem to be significantly associated with liver injury complications, the overall use of antiviral drugs increases the risk of liver injury for critically ill patients with COVID-19. Antiviral drugs are widely used to treat COVID-19, but we recommend that for critically ill patients, antiviral treatment should be used with caution considering both effectiveness and potential adverse effects.","Ruan, Xinjia; Lu, Xiaofan; Wang, Kangyi; Zhang, Bing; Wang, Jun; Li, Yongsheng; Wang, Jiashuo; Xu, Zhengbao; Yan, Fangrong",Annals of palliative medicine,122,28

Several advances in treatment of VTE have been made over the past decades, but definition and reporting of outcomes across those studies are inconsistent. Development of an international core outcome set for clinical studies of interventions for VTE addresses this lack of standardisation. The first step in the development of a core outcome set is to conduct a scoping review which aims to generate an inclusive list of unique outcomes that have been reported in previous studies. METHODS AND ANALYSIS MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials will be searched with no language restriction for prospective studies reporting on interventions for treatment of VTE in patients who are adult and non-pregnant. Records will be sorted in reverse chronological order. Study screening and data extraction will be independently performed by two authors in blocks based on date of publication, starting with 2015 to 2020 and subsequent 1-year periods, until no new outcome measures are identified from the set of included studies. After homogenising spelling and combining outcomes with the same meaning, a list of unique outcomes will be determined. Those outcomes will be grouped into outcome domains. Qualitative analysis and descriptive statistics will be used to report results. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethical approval is not required for this study. The results of this scoping review will be presented at scientific conferences, published in a peer-reviewed journal, and they will provide candidate outcome domains to be considered in subsequent steps in the development of a core outcome set for clinical studies of interventions for VTE.

When occurring, bacterial adherence and biofilm formation on the mesh surface affect the implant's tissue integration and host tissue regeneration, making preventive measures to control prosthetic infection a major goal of prosthetic mesh improvement. METHODS This article reviews the literature on the infection of prosthetic meshes used in hernia repair to describe the in vitro and in vivo models used to examine bacterial adherence and biofilm formation on the surface of different biomaterials. Also discussed are the prophylactic measures used to control implant infection ranging from meshes soaked in antibiotics to mesh coatings that release antimicrobial agents in a controlled manner. RESULTS Prosthetic architecture has a direct effect on bacterial adherence and biofilm formation. Absorbable synthetic materials are more prone to bacterial colonization than non-absorbable materials. The reported behavior of collagen biomeshes, also called xenografts, in a contaminated environment has been contradictory, and their use in this setting needs further clinical investigation. New prophylactic mesh designs include surface modifications with an anti-adhesive substance or pre-treatment with antibacterial agents or metal coatings. CONCLUSIONS The use of polymer coatings that slowly release non-antibiotic drugs seems to be a good strategy to prevent implant contamination and reduce the onset of resistant bacterial strains. Even though the prophylactic designs described in this review are mainly focused on hernia repair meshes, these strategies can be extrapolated to other implantable devices, regardless of their design, shape or dimension.","Pérez-Köhler, Bárbara; Bayon, Yves; Bellón, Juan Manuel",Surgical infections,122,16

Although microsurgery by itself is defined as surgery aided by optical magnification, there are no guidelines for determining in which clinical situations a microscope or loupe should be used. Therefore, we conducted standardized experiments to objectively assess the impact of optical magnification in microsurgery. METHODS Sixteen participants of microsurgical training courses had to complete 2 sets of experiments. Each set had to be performed with an unaided eye, surgical loupes, and a regular operating microscope. The first set of experiments included coaptation of a chicken femoral nerve, and the second set consisted of anastomosing porcine coronary arteries. Evaluation of the sutured nerves and vessels were performed by 2 experienced microsurgeons using an operating microscope. RESULTS The 16 participants of the study completed all of the experiments. The nerve coaptation and vascular anastomoses exercises showed a direct relationship of error frequency and lower optical magnification, meaning that the highest number of microsurgical errors occurred with the unaided eye. For nerve coaptation, there was a strong relationship (P<0.05) between the number of mistakes and magnification, and this relationship was very strong (P<0.01) for vascular anastomoses. CONCLUSIONS We were able to prove that microsurgical success is directly related to optical magnification. The human eye's ability to discriminate potentially important anatomical structures is limited, which might be detrimental for clinical results. Although not legally mandatory, surgeries such as reparative surgery after hand trauma should be conducted with magnifying devices for achieving optimal patient outcomes.","Schoeffl, Harald; Lazzeri, Davide; Schnelzer, Richard; Froschauer, Stefan M; Huemer, Georg M",Archives of plastic surgery,122,27

DESIGN Prognosis systematic review (PROSPERO registration number CRD42016036788). METHODS We searched Embase, Ovid Medline, Cochrane, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, PEDro and Google Scholar from inception to 3rd May 2018. Eligible articles included patients with ACL injury (diagnosis confirmed by MRI and/or diagnostic arthroscopy), reported the number of meniscal tears at the time of ACL injury diagnosis/start of treatment and reported the number of new meniscal tears that subsequently occurred. Articles with fewer than 20 patients at follow-up, and articles limited to ACL revision surgery or multi-ligament knee injuries were excluded. Two independent reviewers screened articles, assessed eligibility, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We judged the certainty of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation (GRADE) working group methodology. RESULTS Of 75 studies included in the systematic review, 54 studies with 9624 patients and 501 new meniscal tears were appropriate for quantitative analysis. Heterogeneity precluded data pooling. The risk of new meniscal tears was 0%-21% when follow-up was <2 years, 0%-29% when follow-up was 2 to 5 years, 5%-52% when follow-up was 5 to 10 years and 4%-31% when follow-up was longer than 10 years. The proportion of studies with high risk of selection, misclassification and detection bias was 84%, 69% and 68%, respectively. Certainty of evidence was very low. CONCLUSION New meniscal tears occurred in 0%-52% of patients between 4 months and 20 years (mean 4.9±4.4 years) following treatment for ACL injury. The certainty of evidence was too low to guide surgical treatment decisions. This review cannot conclude that the incidence of new meniscal tears is lower if ACL injury is treated with surgery compared with treatment with rehabilitation only.","Ekås, Guri Ranum; Ardern, Clare L; Grindem, Hege; Engebretsen, Lars",British journal of sports medicine,122,1

When propofol and remifentanil reached a pseudosteady state at the target concentration and blood pressure was stabilized following surgical stimulation, enrolled patients were administered 1000 mL of Ringer's lactate solution for 20 min, followed by continuous infusion at a rate of 6 mL/kg/h until the time of the last blood collection for volume kinetic analysis. Arterial blood samples were collected to measure the hemoglobin concentration at different time points. The change in hemoglobin-derived plasma dilution induced by the administration of Ringer's lactate solution was evaluated by nonlinear mixed effects modeling. Three hundred and twenty-three plasma dilution data points from 27 patients were used to determine the pharmacokinetic characteristics of Ringer's lactate solution. A two-volume model best described the pharmacokinetics of Ringer's lactate solution. The mean arterial pressure (MAP) and body weight (WT) were significant covariates for the elimination clearance (kr) and central volume of distribution at baseline (Vc0), respectively. The parameter estimates were as follows: kr (mL/min) = 124 + (MAP/70)14.2, Vc0 (mL) = 0.95 + 3440 × (WT/63), Vt0 (mL) = 2730, and kt (mL/min) = 181. A higher MAP was associated with a greater elimination clearance and, consequently, less water accumulation in the interstitium. As body weight increases, volume expansion in the blood vessels increases.","Lee, Joo-Hyun; Choo, Yeong-Jin; Lee, Yong-Hun; Rhim, Jin-Ho; Lee, Soo-Han; Choi, Byung-Moon; Oh, Sung-Tae; Choi, Kyu-Taek; Noh, Gyu-Jeong",Acta pharmacologica Sinica,122,1

Mental health research has shown that prevalence rates of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are high for Black veterans compared with White veterans, and some studies suggest poorer clinical outcomes for Black veterans with PTSD. The aim of this study was to examine the impact of racial disparities longitudinally in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) residential rehabilitation treatment programs (RRTPs). METHODS Participants included 2,870 veterans treated nationally in VA PTSD RRTPs in fiscal year 2017. Veterans provided demographic data upon admission to the program. Symptoms of PTSD and depression were collected at admission, discharge, and 4-month follow-up. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to examine symptom change throughout and after treatment. RESULTS Black veterans experienced attenuated PTSD symptom reduction during treatment as well as greater depression symptom recurrence 4 months after discharge, relative to White veterans. CONCLUSIONS This study adds to the body of literature that has documented poorer treatment outcomes for Black compared with White veterans with PTSD. Although both Black and White veterans had an overall reduction in symptoms, future research should focus on understanding the causes, mechanisms, and potential solutions to reduce racial disparities in mental health treatment.","Gross, Georgina M; Smith, Noelle; Holliday, Ryan; Rozek, David C; Hoff, Rani; Harpaz-Rotem, Ilan",Psychiatric services,122,11

Untreated, these aneurysms have a tendency to progress, often resulting in neurological symptoms or rupture leading to subarachnoid hemorrhage. The microsurgical treatment of these lesions can be difficult due to their location and the circumferential involvement of the arteries. These features make microsurgical treatment prone to high morbidity. The Pipeline Embolization Device (PED) has gained popularity for the treatment of aneurysms of the internal carotid artery. Its use in the posterior circulation has been limited, likely due to a fear of perforating artery occlusion. METHODS The authors retrospectively reviewed their database of patients treated with the PED and identified 12 patients who had VFAs. The clinical features, complications, and outcomes of these patients were analyzed. RESULTS At an average follow-up of 11 months, the mean modified Rankin Scale score was 1.9. Complete aneurysm occlusion was seen in 90% of the patients with radiographic follow-up. Three patients suffered new neurological deficits postoperatively. One of these patients died, while the remaining 2 demonstrated significant clinical improvement at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS With attention to the anatomy of perforating arteries, staged contralateral vertebral artery sacrifice, and adequate platelet inhibition, PED may be an effective treatment option-alone or in a hybrid construct with stents of less coverage for VFAs-with an acceptable complication rate.","Munich, Stephan A; Tan, Lee A; Keigher, Kiffon M; Chen, Michael; Moftakhar, Roham; Lopes, Demetrius K",Journal of neurosurgery,122,1

However, the impact of the crystal phase of TMDs on their performance in photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and photothermal therapy (PTT) remains unclear. Herein, the preparation of ultrasmall single-layer MoS2 nanodots with different phases (1T and 2H phase) is reported to explore their phase-dependent performances as nanoagents for PAI guided PTT in the second near-infrared (NIR-II) window. Significantly, the 1T-MoS2 nanodots give a much higher extinction coefficient (25.6 L g-1 cm-1 ) at 1064 nm and subsequent photothermal power conversion efficiency (PCE: 43.3%) than that of the 2H-MoS2 nanodots (extinction coefficient: 5.3 L g-1 cm-1 , PCE: 21.3%). Moreover, the 1T-MoS2 nanodots also give strong PAI signals as compared to negligible signals of 2H-MoS2 nanodots in the NIR-II window. After modification with polyvinylpyrrolidone, the 1T-MoS2 nanodots can be used as a highly efficient agent for PAI guided PTT to effectively ablate cancer cells in vitro and tumors in vivo under 1064 nm laser irradiation. This work proves that the crystal phase plays a key role in determining the performance of nanoagents based on TMD nanomaterials for PAI guided PTT.","Zhou, Zhan; Li, Bowen; Shen, Chuang; Wu, Di; Fan, Huacheng; Zhao, Jiangqi; Li, Hai; Zeng, Zhiyuan; Luo, Zhimin; Ma, Lufang; Tan, Chaoliang",Small,122,33

Tissue-engineered synthetic flaps are currently unable to repair clinically-relevant, large-volume defects; allogenic flaps from cadaveric donors could provide a ready-to-use biological alternative if treated with methods to avoid the immune-rejection of the donor's cells. Here, we describe the successful decellularization of a large (> 800 cc) human-derived adipose flap through a perfusion apparatus; we demonstrate the complete removal of the immunogenic cellular components of the flap with the retention of its structural components and vascular network.

Using lattice-Boltzmann/immersed boundary simulations we propose a biological Rayleigh-Plateau instability as the biophysical mechanism behind this fragmentation process. This instability is akin to the surface tension-induced breakup of a liquid jet but is driven by active cortical processes including actomyosin contractility and microtubule sliding. Our fully three-dimensional simulations highlight the crucial role of actomyosin contractility, which is required to trigger the instability, and illustrate how the wavelength of the instability determines the size of the final platelets. The elasto-hydrodynamic origin of the fragmentation explains the strong acceleration of platelet biogenesis in the presence of an external flow, which we observe in agreement with experiments. Our simulations then allow us to disentangle the influence of specific flow conditions: While a homogeneous flow with uniform velocity leads to the strongest acceleration, a shear flow with a linear velocity gradient can cause fusion events of two developing platelet-sized swellings during fragmentation. A fusion event may lead to the release of larger structures which are observable as preplatelets in experiments. Together, our findings strongly indicate a mainly physical origin of fragmentation and regulation of platelet size in flow-accelerated platelet biogenesis.","Bächer, Christian; Bender, Markus; Gekle, Stephan",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,122,19

Despite robust evidence of efficacy and safety, key questions regarding the manner of their use remain unanswered. Recent studies demonstrated that the Pipeline device geometry can dramatically affect its metal coverage, emphasizing the negative effects of oversizing the device relative to its target vessels. This follow-up investigation focuses on the geometry and coverage of multidevice constructs. MATERIALS AND METHODS A number of Pipeline devices were deployed in tubes of known diameters and photographed, and the resultant coverage was determined by image segmentation. Multidevice segmentation images were created to study the effects of telescoped devices and provide an estimate of coverages resulting from device overlap. RESULTS Double overlap yields a range of metal coverage, rather than a single value, determined by the diameters of both devices, the size of the recipient artery, and the degree to which strands of the overlapped devices are coregistered with each other. The potential variation in coverage is greatest during overlap of identical-diameter devices, for example, ranging from 24% to 41% for two 3.75-mm devices deployed in a 3.5-mm vessel. Overlapping devices of progressively different diameters produce correspondingly more uniform ranges of coverage, though reducing the maximum achievable value, for example, yielding a 33%-34% range for 3.75- and 4.75-mm devices deployed in the same 3.5-mm vessel.

Whereas the expression of TRAIL on activated NK and T cells increases their cytotoxicity, induction of TRAIL on APCs can turn them into apoptosis inducers but might also change their immunostimulatory capacity. Therefore, we analyzed how TRAIL-receptor (TRAIL-R) costimulation is modulating TCR-mediated activation of human T cells. T cells triggered by rTRAIL in combination with anti-CD3 and -CD28 Abs exhibited a strong decrease in the expression of activation markers and Th1 and Th2 cytokines compared with CD3/CD28-activated T cells. Most importantly, proliferation of TRAIL-R costimulated T cells was strongly impaired, but no apoptosis was induced. Addition of exogenous IL-2 could not rescue T cells silenced by TRAIL-R costimulation, and TRAIL-mediated inhibition of T cell proliferation only prevented TCR-triggered proliferation but was ineffective if T cells were activated downstream of the TCR. Inhibition of T cell proliferation was associated with abrogation of proximal TCR signaling by inhibiting recruitment of TCR-associated signaling molecules to lipid rafts, followed by abrogation of protein tyrosine phosphorylation of ZAP70, phospholipase C-γ1, and protein kinase C-θ, and impaired nuclear translocation of NFAT, AP-1, and NF-κB. Most importantly, TRAIL-R costimulation efficiently inhibited alloantigen-induced T cell proliferation and CD3/28-induced activation and proliferation of autoreactive T cells derived from patients with Omenn syndrome, indicating that coactivation of TRAIL-R and TCR represents a mechanism to downmodulate T cell immune responses.","Lehnert, Corinna; Weiswange, Maxi; Jeremias, Irmela; Bayer, Carina; Grunert, Michaela; Debatin, Klaus-Michael; Strauss, Gudrun",Journal of immunology,122,5

However, knowledge regarding the dynamics of its evolution is practically non-existent. In the past, diverse authors have referred to CTV as a highly variable virus, implying rapid evolution. Others have, in recent times, referred to CTV as an exceptionally slowly evolving virus. In this work, we used the capsid protein (CP) gene to estimate the rate of evolution. This was obtained from a large set of heterochronous CP gene sequences using a bayesian coalescent approach. The best-fitting evolutionary and population models pointed to an evolutionary rate of 1.58×10(-4) nt per site year(-1) (95 % highest posterior density, 1.73×10(-5)-3.16×10(-4) nt per site year(-1)). For an unbiased comparison with other plant and animal viruses, the evolutionary rate of synonymous substitutions was considered. In a series of 88 synonymous evolutionary rates, ranging from 5.2×10(-6) to 6.2×10(-2) nt per site year(-1), CTV ranks in the 10th percentile, embedded among the slowest animal RNA viruses.

TNC levels are increased in patients with pneumonia and pneumosepsis, and they are associated with worse outcomes. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a Gram-positive bacterium that is a major causative pathogen in nosocomial pneumonia and a rising cause of community-acquired pneumonia. To study the role of TNC during MRSA-induced pneumonia, TNC sufficient (TNC+/+) and TNC-deficient (TNC-/-) mice were infected with MRSA via the airways and euthanized after 6, 24, and 48 h for analysis. Pulmonary transcription of TNC peaked at 6 h, while immunohistochemistry revealed higher protein levels at later time points. Although TNC deficiency was not associated with changes in bacterial clearance, TNC-/- mice showed increased levels of TNF-α and IL-6 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid during the acute phase of infection when compared with TNC+/+ mice. In addition, TNC-/- mice showed more severe pulmonary pathology at 6, but not at 24 or 48 h, after infection. Together, these data suggest that TNC plays a moderate protective role against tissue pathology during the acute inflammatory phase, but not during the bacterial clearance phase, of MRSA-induced pneumonia. These results argue against an important role of TNC on disease outcome during MRSA-induced pneumonia. IMPORTANCE Recently, the immunomodulatory properties of TNC have drawn substantial interest. However, to date most studies made use of sterile models of inflammation. In this study, we examine the pathobiology of MRSA-induced pneumonia in a model of TNC-sufficient and TNC-deficient mice. We have studied the immune response and tissue pathology both during the initial insult and also during the resolution phase. We demonstrate that MRSA-induced pneumonia upregulates pulmonary TNC expression at the mRNA and protein levels. However, the immunomodulatory role of TNC during bacterial pneumonia is distinct from models of sterile inflammation, indicating that the function of TNC is context dependent. Contrary to previous descriptions of TNC as a proinflammatory mediator, TNC-deficient mice seem to suffer from enhanced tissue pathology during the acute phase of infection. Nonetheless, besides its role during the acute phase response, TNC does not seem to play a major role in disease outcome during MRSA-induced pneumonia.","Meijer, Mariska T; de Vos, Alex F; Peters Sengers, Hessel; Scicluna, Brendon P; Roelofs, Joris J; Abou Fayçal, Chérine; Uhel, Fabrice; Orend, Gertraud; van der Poll, Tom",Microbiology spectrum,122,1

One way to support workers is for supervisors to engage in behaviors promoting employees' well-being and attitudes toward preventive medicine practices. We examined whether health-promoting leadership contributes to these outcomes in a population of active-duty soldiers (N = 173) deployed to provide nonmedical support in Liberia during the 2014 Ebola epidemic using data reported in Sipos, Kim, Thomas, and Adler (Mil Med 183[3-4]:e171-e178, 2018). Soldiers completed surveys assessing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, sleep problems, burnout, morale, and attitudes and rated their leaders on health-promoting behaviors. Using mixed-effects logistic regression, health-promoting leadership focused on psychological health was associated with decreased odds of PTSD, depression, anxiety, and burnout, and increased odds of high morale and avoiding unnecessary risk. Health-promoting leadership focused on preventive medicine was associated with decreased odds of depression and anxiety, and increased odds of high morale, positive attitudes, and avoiding unnecessary risk. Findings suggest health-promoting leadership could be valuable for workers responding to epidemics.","Booth, Laurel C; Schwalb, Molly E; Kim, Paul Y; Adler, Amy B",The Journal of nervous and mental disease,122,16

MEASUREMENTS AND FINDINGS Mental disorders were assessed using the ""Depression Anxiety Stress Scale"" and social support was determined using the ""Multidimensional Perceived Social Support Scale."" Pregnant women had moderate levels of anxiety and depression and mild levels of stress. Anxiety, depression, and stress of moderate or high severity was reported in 62.2%, 44.6%, and 32.2% of the women, respectively. Pregnant women who lost their jobs during the pandemic period showed a 3-fold increase in the risk of anxiety, a 6-fold increase in the risk of depression, and a 4.8-fold increase in the risk of stress. An increase in the perception of social support has protective effects against all three mental disorders during pregnancy. In pregnant women with at least one obstetric risk, the risk of antenatal anxiety is 2 times higher than that in women with no risk. Similarly, women with a chronic physical illness before pregnancy have a higher risk of anxiety during pregnancy than healthy women. Financial strain has predictive value for anxiety and depression, and advanced age is a predictor for depression. KEY CONCLUSIONS The incidence of mental disorders in pregnant women during the pandemic period was much higher than that during the pre-pandemic period. The high frequency of antenatal mental disorders can lead to an increase in the frequency of obstetric and maternal complications in the short and long term. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE Early detection of inadequate social support and economic difficulties of pregnant women during the pandemic period is recommended for protecting their mental health. Pregnant women should have easy access to psychosocial support, and they should be provided obstetric counseling during the pandemic conditions.","Koyucu, Refika Genç; Karaca, Pelin Palas",Midwifery,122,1

Lives pierced by death.,14.741831,5.0799274,2020,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected the health-care system drastically, including dental care practice. COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is thought to spread via close contact through respiratory droplets and aerosols. Owing to specific characteristics of dental care such as aerosol generation as well as close proximity to patients, dentistry is thought to be associated with the nosocomial spread of infection. The risk of bidirectional spread of infection between patient and dental care providers makes it critical to take additional precautionary measures to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. It is essential to understand that the guidelines for providing dental treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic will vary across the globe, and dental practices should be in compliance with their regional guidelines. This chapter aims to present an overview of the dynamics of COVID-19 transmission and its impact on dentistry and discuss measures to provide dental care during the time of the COVID-19 outbreak effectively.","Tonkaboni, Arghavan; Amirzade-Iranaq, Mohammad Hosein; Ziaei, Heliya; Ather, Amber",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,122,1

Bimetallic catalysts are a kind of promising candidates, like the hybrids of Co and VN nanoparticles (Co/VN). However, the inevitable aggregation during the preparation and electrochemical process lowers their reactivity and durability. Herein, small Co/VN nanoparticles (4-8 nm) embedded in porous graphitic carbon layers (Co/VN NPs@C) were obtained through the pyrolysis of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). The synergistic effect of in situ generated Co and VN NPs together with fast electron transfer from graphitic carbon layers renders this catalyst to possess excellent trifunctional performance. More attractively, Co/VN NPs@C as both the anode and the cathode shows a low voltage of 1.58 V when the current density is up to 10 mA cm-2, exceeding most electrocatalysts based on non-noble metals. The rechargeable Zn-air batteries constructed by Co/VN NPs@C deliver high round-trip efficiency together with a peak power density of 130 mW cm-2, a specific capacity of 757 mAh g-1, and desirable stability, outperforming the traditional Zn-air batteries based on the Pt/C and RuO2 pair. This work opens a promising avenue toward constructing highly effective multifunctional electrocatalysts by designing small-sized nanoparticles with various active sites derived from MOFs.","Zheng, Haiyan; Xu, Na; Hou, Baoshan; Zhao, Xue; Dong, Man; Sun, Chunyi; Wang, Xin-Long; Su, Zhong-Min",ACS applied materials & interfaces,122,16

We present our initial experience and outcomes of patients undergoing transthoracic MIE using a circular end-to-side anastomosis created with the transorally directed EEA circular stapler OrVil (Covidien, New Haven, CT). Complications, including anastomotic leak and stricture occurrence, are reviewed. METHODS A retrospective review evaluated consecutive patients undergoing MIE for esophageal cancer or related disease with intrathoracic end-to-side anastomoses using the transorally directed EEA circular stapler from December 2007 to May 2010. Medical records were reviewed for demographics, staging, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, comorbidities, adjuvant therapy, complications, and survival. RESULTS During this period, 51 consecutive patients (84% male; mean age, 65 years) underwent MIE. Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy was performed in 32 patients, and 4 had intraoperative radiotherapy. Mean operative time was 338 minutes (range, 211 to 565 minutes), including the 4 patients with intraoperative radiotherapy. Operative time improved with experience (excluding intraoperative radiotherapy) from a mean of 378 minutes (patients 1 to 14) to 300 minutes (patients 37 to 51). Median hospital stay was 11 days (range, 6 to 48 days). Anastomotic leaks occurred in 5 patients (9.8%). Postoperative deaths included 1 in-hospital (2.0%) and 2 (3.9%) after discharge. Stricture was diagnosed and treated in 7 patients (13.7%). Follow-up was a median of 12 months (range, 1 to 31 months). CONCLUSIONS Transthoracic MIE using an end-to-side anastomosis with the transorally directed EEA circular stapler resulted in acceptable stricture and leak rates with good outcomes comparable to published outcomes for open surgical resections.","Jaroszewski, Dawn E; Williams, Dustin G; Fleischer, David E; Ross, Helen J; Romero, Yvonne; Harold, Kristi L",The Annals of thoracic surgery,122,31

The purpose of this study was to clarify the involvement of uremic toxins (indoxyl sulfate (IS), 3-indoleacetic acid, p-cresyl sulfate and kynurenic acid) on CKD-induced adipose tissue inflammation. IS induces monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) expression and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in the differentiated 3T3L-1 adipocyte. An organic anion transporter (OAT) inhibitor, an NADPH oxidase inhibitor or an antioxidant suppresses the IS-induced MCP-1 expression and ROS production, suggesting the OAT/NADPH oxidase/ROS pathway is involved in the action of IS. Co-culturing 3T3L-1 adipocytes and mouse macrophage cells showed incubating adipocytes with IS increased macrophage infiltration. An IS-overload in healthy mice increased IS levels, oxidative stress and MCP-1 expression in epididymal adipose tissue compared to unloaded mice. Using 5/6-nephrectomized mice, the administration of AST-120 suppressed oxidative stress and the expression of MCP-1, F4/80 and TNF-α in epididymal adipose tissue. These collective data suggest IS could be a therapeutic target for the CKD-related inflammatory response in adipose tissue, and that AST-120 could be useful for the treatment of IS-induced adipose tissue inflammation.","Tanaka, Shoma; Watanabe, Hiroshi; Nakano, Takehiro; Imafuku, Tadashi; Kato, Hiromasa; Tokumaru, Kai; Arimura, Nanaka; Enoki, Yuki; Maeda, Hitoshi; Tanaka, Motoko; Matsushita, Kazutaka; Fukagawa, Masafumi; Maruyama, Toru",Toxins,122,26

We compared IMRT and conventional radiotherapy (CRT) outcomes in ASCC patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed records of 223 ASCC patients treated at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center from 1991 to 2010. Forty-five patients received IMRT and 178 CRT. We determined locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRFS), distant metastases-free survival (DMFS), and overall survival (OS) for each radiation modality. A propensity score analysis was performed using potentially confounding variables. Locoregional and distant patterns of failure for CRT and IMRT were compared. RESULTS Patients treated with IMRT had significantly higher N stage (P<.01), and were less likely to be treated with induction chemotherapy (P=.01). The 2-year LRFS, DMFS, and OS were 87%, 86%, and 93%, respectively, for IMRT; and 82%, 88%, 90%, respectively, for CRT; with no significant difference in outcomes by univariate analysis or in a propensity score analysis adjusted for disparity between the groups. CONCLUSIONS This large, single-institution experience of definitive chemoradiation for ASCC using CRT vs. IMRT demonstrates that outcomes are not compromised by more conformal radiotherapy. In the absence of prospective, multi-institutional, randomized trials of IMRT in ASCC, these retrospective data, using methods to minimize bias, can help to establish the role of IMRT in the definitive therapy of ASCC.","Dasgupta, Tina; Rothenstein, Diana; Chou, Joanne F; Zhang, Zhigang; Wright, Jean L; Saltz, Leonard B; Temple, Larissa K; Paty, Philip B; Weiser, Martin R; Guillem, Jose G; Nash, Garrett M; Goodman, Karyn A",Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology,122,1

We investigated the effects of ivabradine on post-resuscitation myocardial function in a porcine model of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. METHODS AND RESULTS Ventricular fibrillation was induced and untreated for 8 minutes while defibrillation was attempted after 6 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation in anesthetized domestic swine. Then the animals were randomized into ivabradine and placebo groups (n = 5 each). Ivabradine and saline were administered at the same volume 5 minutes after ROSC (Return of Spontaneous Circulation), followed by continuous intravenous infusion at 0.5 mg/kg for 480 minutes. Hemodynamic parameters were continuously recorded. Myocardial function was assessed by echocardiography at baseline and at 60, 120, 240, 480 minutes and 24 hours after resuscitation. The serum levels of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) were measured by commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. Animals were killed 24 hours after resuscitation, and all myocardial tissue was removed for histopathological analysis. The heart rate was significantly reduced from 1 hour after resuscitation in the ivabradine group (all p < 0.05). The post-resuscitation mitral E/A and E/e' velocity ratios and left ventricular ejection fraction were significantly better in the ivabradine than placebo group (p < 0.05). The serum levels of myocardial injury biomarkers (NT-proBNP, cTnI) and the myocardial biopsy scores were significantly lower in the ivabradine than placebo group (p < 0.05). Neurological deficit scores were lower in the IVA group at PR 24 hours (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Ivabradine improved post-resuscitation myocardial dysfunction, myocardial injury and post-resuscitation cerebral function, and also slowed the heart rate in this porcine model.","Yang, Min; Che, Limin; Hua, Tianfeng; Zou, Yangyang; Yang, Zhengfei",Shock,122,1

Currently, there is no specific drug or vaccine besides symptomatic supportive therapy. Taking full advantage of the clinical experience of traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) in preventing and controlling major epidemics such as SARS, it is an important mission for TCM to propose effective formula with immediate response and solid evidence by using modern biomedical knowledge and techniques(molecular docking assisted TCM formulation for short). In view of the high homology between the gene sequences of the novel coronavirus and SARS virus, and the similarities between the two in terms of pathogenic mechanism and clinical manifestations, our team established a rapid screening and optimization model for the prevention and treatment of the novel coronavirus based on clinical experience and molecular docking technology. Firstly, the clinical team and the research team pre-developed and screened TCM formula by using ""back-to-back"" manner. Then, the formula was optimized and determined by comparing and analyzing the results of the two groups. The results showed that the research team screened out 46 active ingredients from candidate TCMs that could act on the novel coronavirus S-protein-binding site of human ACE2 protein, which were mainly attributed to 7 herbs such as Lonicerae Japonicae Flos and Mori Folium. The result was largely consistent with the formula raised by the clinical group, verifying and supporting its rationality. This provides evidence for the scientific and potential efficacy of the TCM prescription from the perspective of treatment target analysis, and also suggests that the TCM prescription has the potential to directly inhibit viral infection in addition to improving clinical symptoms or syndromes. Based on this, our team optimized and formed a new anti-coronavirus TCM prescription ""Keguan Yihao"", immediately providing the TCM prescription with certain clinical experience and objective evidence support for the prevention and treatment of new emergent infectious diseases in our hospital. The TCM prescription was combined with modern medicine symptomatic supportive treatment for clinical treatment, preliminary results showed better effect than symptomatic supportive therapy alone. This research has innovated the method mode in clinical practice and basic research integration of traditional Chinese medicine for the prevention and control of new emerging infectious diseases. It is of great significance to further improve the rapid response mechanism of TCM in face of major epidemics, and further improve the capability level of TCM to prevent and treat new emerging infectious diseases.","Niu, Ming; Wang, Rui-Lin; Wang, Zhong-Xia; Zhang, Ping; Bai, Zhao-Fang; Jing, Jing; Guo, Yu-Ming; Zhao, Xu; Zhan, Xiao-Yan; Zhang, Zi-Teng; Song, Xue-Ai; Qin, En-Qiang; Wang, Jia-Bo; Xiao, Xiao-He",Zhongguo Zhong yao za zhi = Zhongguo zhongyao zazhi = China journal of Chinese materia medica,122,16

Apart from the clinically and electrocardiographically discernible causes of ACI, such as acute myocardial infarction (MI), other cardiac causes need to be considered such as myocarditis, Takotsubo syndrome, and direct injury from COVID-19, together with noncardiac conditions, such as pulmonary embolism, critical illness, and sepsis. Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) with normal or near-normal coronary arteries (ACS-NNOCA) appear to have a higher prevalence in both COVID-19 positive and negative patients in the pandemic compared to the pre-pandemic era. Echocardiography, coronary angiography, chest computed tomography and/or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging may render a correct diagnosis, obviating the need for endomyocardial biopsy. Importantly, a significant delay has been recorded in patients with ACS seeking advice for their symptoms, while their routine care has been sharply disrupted with fewer urgent coronary angiographies and/or primary percutaneous coronary interventions performed in the case of ST-elevation MI (STEMI) with an inappropriate shift toward thrombolysis, all contributing to a higher complication rate in these patients. Thus, new challenges have emerged in rendering a diagnosis and delivering treatment in patients with ACI/ACS in the pandemic era.

Methods: Relevant articles from PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science were searched as of April 5, 2020. The quality of the included papers was appraised using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS). Data of interest were collected and evaluated for their compatibility for the meta-analysis. Cumulative calculations to determine the correlation and effect estimates were performed using the Z test. Results: In total, 19 papers recording 1,934 mild and 1,644 severe cases of COVID-19 were included. Based on the initial evaluation, 62 potential risk factors were identified for the meta-analysis. Several comorbidities, including chronic respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension were observed more frequent among patients with severe COVID-19 than with the mild ones. Compared to the mild form, severe COVID-19 was associated with symptoms such as dyspnea, anorexia, fatigue, increased respiratory rate, and high systolic blood pressure. Lower levels of lymphocytes and hemoglobin; elevated levels of leukocytes, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, blood creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, high-sensitivity troponin, creatine kinase, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, interleukin 6, D-dimer, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, and procalcitonin; and a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate were also associated with severe COVID-19. Conclusion: More than 30 risk factors are associated with a higher risk of severe COVID-19.

We previously discovered a 3866T>C mutation within the gene for the ND1 subunit of complex I as possibly amplifying disease progression for patients bearing the disease-causing 11778G>A mutation, within the gene for the ND4 subunit of Complex I. However, whether and how the ND1 mutation exacerbates the ND4 mutation were unknown. In this report, we showed that four Chinese families bearing both m.3866T>C and m.11778G>A mutations exhibited higher penetrances of LHON than 6 Chinese pedigrees carrying only the m.3866T>C mutation or families harboring only the m.11778G>A mutation. The protein structure analysis revealed that the m.3866T>C (I187T) and m.11778G>A (R340H) mutations destabilized the specific interactions with other residues of ND1 and ND4, thereby altering the structure and function of complex I, respectively. Cellular data obtained using cybrids constructed by transferring mitochondria from the Chinese families into mtDNA-less (ro) cells demonstrated that the mutations perturbed the stability, assembly and activity of complex I, leading to changes in mitochondrial ATP levels and membrane potential, and increasing the production of reactive oxygen species. These mitochondrial dysfunctions promoted the apoptotic sensitivity of cells and decreased mitophagy. Cybrids bearing only m.3866T>C mutation displayed mild mitochondrial dysfunctions while those harboring both m.3866T>C and m.11778G>A mutations exhibited greater mitochondrial dysfunctions. These suggested that the m.3866T>C mutation acted as the synergy with m.11778G>A mutation, aggravating mitochondrial dysfunctions contributing to higher penetrance of LHON in these families carrying both mtDNA mutations.","Ji, Yanchun; Zhang, Juanjuan; Lu, Yuanyuan; Yi, Qiuzi; Chen, Mengquan; Xie, Shipeng; Mao, Xiaoting; Xiao, Yun; Meng, Feilong; Zhang, Minlian; Yang, Rulai; Guan, Min-Xin",The Journal of biological chemistry,122,16

It ranges from mild hypoxemia without significant signs of respiratory distress, to rapid clinically deteriorating course with severe hypoxemia. Unexplained severe hypoxemia, associated with platypnea, triggers the possibility of ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatch, ranging from intrapulmonary shunts (IPS) to alveolar dead space ventilation. In the literature, very few cases with COVID-19-pneumonia have been reported with IPS. Herein, we report a COVID-19 confirmed 45-year male patient, who developed IPS without apparent pulmonary perfusion defect on lung perfusion scintigraphy. The patient had no cardiovascular disease except chronic pulmonary hypertension secondary to interstitial lung disease.

Ten participants (average illness duration 7.4 years) were interviewed (average length, 79 minutes) via a semi-structured interview schedule and verbatim transcriptions were analysed with interpretative phenomenological analysis. The four superordinate themes revealed were 'comparisons of past to present self: ""you have to be someone else, and you have to live with that''', 'the effect of social isolation on identity and subsequent insights into others' behaviours', 'contemplation of future and identity: ''where do I go from here?""', and 'PTG: ""the letting go, the building up, [and] the gradual process of rebuilding""'. These themes outlined the experiences of those with ME/CFS as they underwent changes in identity due to the limitations the condition imposed on activities and roles, understanding others' behaviours after a period of isolation, the comparison of the past self with the present self and finally, the positive growth that was noted by two of the interviewees with regards to a new 'true' self.

DESIGN The design used in this study was systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA RESOURCES We followed our published protocol (PROSPERO [CRD42019140058]) and searched the following databases: PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, and Embase from inception to February 2020. The reference lists of eligible studies were also searched. ELIGIBILITY All longitudinal retrospective record review studies that examined adverse event rates before and after the introduction of patient safety initiatives in hospital inpatients were included. DATA EXTRACTION Data extraction, quality, and risk of bias assessment were carried out by 2 independent reviewers. Information on study design, setting, demographics, interventions, and safety outcome measures was extracted. RESULTS A total of 3894 articles were screened, and 7 articles met the eligibility criteria for our systematic review with 5 of these providing sufficient information for inclusion in the meta-analysis. The degree of heterogeneity was high among studies. The meta-analysis demonstrated a minimal risk reduction in overall adverse event rates of 0.017 (95% confidence interval, 0.002-0.032) when the lower-quality studies were excluded, with one adverse event being prevented for every 59 hospital admissions. CONCLUSIONS These findings are significant when the large numbers of admissions to a hospital every year are considered.

OBJECTIVE To assess whether a group-based exercise program relative to a personal exercise program (both delivered online) and wait-list control (WLC) can improve the psychological health of previously low active older adults during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS The Seniors COvid-19 Pandemic and Exercise (SCOPE) Trial was a 3-arm, parallel randomized controlled trial conducted between May and September 2020 in which low active older adults (aged ≥ 65 years) were recruited via media outlets and social media. After baseline assessments, consented participants were randomized to one of two 12-week exercise programs (delivered online by older adult instructors) or a waitlist control condition. 241 older adults (n= 187 women) provided baseline measures (via online questionnaires), were randomized (Ngroup = 80, Npersonal = 82 Ncontrol = 79), and completed measures every two weeks for the duration of the trial. The trial's primary outcome was psychological flourishing. Secondary outcomes included global measures of mental and physical health, life satisfaction and depression symptoms. RESULTS The results of latent growth modeling revealed no intervention effects for flourishing, life satisfaction, or depression symptoms (Ps> .05). Participants in the group condition displayed improved mental health relative to WLC participants over the first 10 weeks (ES = .288 to .601), and although the week 12 effect (ES = .375) was in the same direction the difference was not statistically significant (P >. 05). Participants in the personal condition displayed improved mental health, when compared to WLC participants, in the same medium effect size range (ES = .293 to .565) over the first 8 weeks, and while the effects were of a similar magnitude at weeks 10 (ES = .455) and 12 (ES = .258) they were not statistically significant (P >.05). In addition, participants in the group condition displayed improvements in physical health when compared to the WLC (ES = .079 to .496) across all 12 weeks of the study following baseline. No differences were observed between the personal exercise condition and WLC for physical health (P>.05). CONCLUSIONS There were no intervention effects for the trial's primary outcome, psychological flourishing. It is possible that the high levels of psychological flourishing at baseline may have limited the extent to which those indicators could continue to improve further through intervention (i.e., potential ceiling effects). However, the intervention effects for mental and physical health point to the potential capacity of low-cost and scalable at-home programs to support the mental and physical health of previously inactive adults in the COVID-19 pandemic.

MATERIALS AND METHODS This prospective study was institutional review board approved, and all patients provided written informed consent. Fifty patients (45 men and five women; mean age, 76.0 years) admitted for elective abdominal EVAR underwent preoperative abdominal CT angiography (triplanar reformatted images; section thickness of 1-3 mm) and nonenhanced MR angiography (triplanar two-dimensional single-shot turbo field-echo images; section thickness of 6 mm). Two observers independently completed standard measurement and device selection forms for endovascular stent planning for CT and MR angiography. Pearson and intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated to evaluate intermodality and interobserver differences. RESULTS No significant difference was found in aortic neck diameter (observer 1: CT, 18.5 mm; MR, 19.0 mm; P = .43) (observer 2: CT, 19.6 mm; MR, 19.3 mm; P = .59), aortic neck diameter 15 mm distal to the lowest renal artery (observer 1: CT, 19.2 mm; MR, 19.2 mm; P = .38) (observer 2: CT, 19.6 mm; MR, 19.6 mm; P = .91), aortic neck length (observer 1: CT, 43.6 mm; MR, 43.6 mm; P = .85) (observer 2: CT, 44.4 mm; MR, 44.0 mm; P = .93), or other key vascular measurements (P = .23-.99) for preoperative planning. These included aneurysm diameter, lowest renal artery to aortic bifurcation length, aortic bifurcation diameter, common iliac artery diameters, external iliac artery diameters, length between orifices of lower renal and internal iliac arteries, and iliac artery sealing length. CT and MR angiography measurements showed very strong correlation (r = 0.92-0.99). Intraclass correlation coefficients between observers ranged from 0.90 to 0.98. Stent types and configurations determined with CT measurements remained unaltered when reassessed with MR measurements. CONCLUSION Measurements obtained with nonenhanced MR angiography appear equally accurate to those of CT angiography in the preoperative planning of abdominal EVAR.","Goshima, Satoshi; Kanematsu, Masayuki; Kondo, Hiroshi; Kawada, Hiroshi; Kojima, Toshihisa; Sakurai, Kota; Watanabe, Haruo; Shimabukuro, Katsuya; Matsuno, Yukihiro; Ishida, Narihiro; Takemura, Hirofumi; Bae, Kyongtae T",Radiology,122,31

A subset of AD patients exhibitsa disseminated severe HSV infection called eczema herpeticum (EH) which can cause life-threatening complications. This review gives an overview of the clinical picture, and characteristics of the patients as well as the diagnosis and therapy of EH. A special focus lies on the pathophysiological hallmarksidentified so farthat predispose for EH. This aspect coversgenetic aberrations, immunological changes and environmental influences displaying a complex multifactorial situation, which is not completely understood.Type 2 skewing of virus-specific T cells in ADEH+ patients has been implicated in immune profile abnormalities, along withimpaired functions of dendritic cells and natural killer cells. Furthermore, aberrations ininterferon pathway related genes such as IFNG and IFNGR1 have been identified to increase the risk of EH. IL-4, IL-25, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) are overexpressed in EH, whereas antimicrobial peptides like humanβ-defensinsand LL-37 are reduced. Concerning the epidermal barrier, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in skin barrier proteins such as filaggrin were identified in ADEH+ patients. A dysbalance of theskin microbiomealso contributes to EH due to an increase of Staphylococcus aureus, which provides asupporting role to the viral infection via secreted toxins such as a-toxin. The risk of EH is reduced in AD patients treated with dupilumab. Further research is needed to identify and specifically target risk factors for EH in AD patients.","Traidl, Stephan; Rösner, Lennart; Zeitvogel, Jana; Werfel, Thomas",Allergy,122,26

The PROMISE-EPI study aims to address the latter by identifying HIV infected mothers during an almost never-missed visit for their infant, the second extended program on immunization visit at 6-8 weeks of age (EPI-2). The study is divided into 3 components inclusive of an open-label randomized controlled trial aiming to assess the efficacy of a responsive preventive intervention compared to routine intervention based on the national PMTCT guidelines for HIV-1 uninfected exposed breastfeeding infants. The preventive intervention includes: a) Point of care testing for early infant HIV diagnosis and maternal viral load; b) infant, single-drug Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) (lamivudine) if mothers are virally unsuppressed. The primary outcome is HIV-transmission rate from EPI-2 to 12 months. The study targets to screen 37,000 mother/infant pairs in Zambia and Burkina Faso to identify 2000 mother/infant pairs for the clinical trial. The study design and challenges faced during study implementation are described, including the COVID-19 pandemic and the amended HIV guidelines in Zambia in 2020 (triple-drug PrEP in HIV exposed infants guided by quarterly maternal viral load).

METHODS A retrospective review was performed for all patients who underwent surgery for midshaft clavicle nonunion at a Level I trauma center. Visual analog scales (VAS) for pain and Quick-DASH (Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder, and Hand) score were assessed. Bone union rate, change in length of affected clavicle, complications, and reoperation were determined. Risk factors were identified to determine the effect on the healing. RESULTS Thirty-four patients were included for analysis. All patients achieved solid bone union at mean 16 weeks (range 8-36) after surgery. The mean shortening of affected clavicle decreased significantly postoperatively (P < 0.001). There was significant improvement in both pain VAS and Quick-DASH score (P < 0.001). There was no wound complication, infection, or major neurovascular injury. Ten patients (29%) complained of plate irritation and underwent removal of implant without any subsequent adverse event. Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that high-energy trauma and previous surgery were the independent risk factors that significantly delayed time to union (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION Osteosynthesis with autologous dual bone graft for nonunion of midshaft clavicle produced an excellent union rate with good clinical outcome and minimal complications.","Lim, Sungjoon; Cho, Euihwan; Chun, Jae-Myeung; Jeon, In-Ho",European journal of orthopaedic surgery & traumatology : orthopedie traumatologie,122,1

Its clinical presentation can vary from the asymptomatic state to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ dysfunction. Due to our insufficient understanding of its pathophysiology and lack of effective treatment, the morbidity and mortality of severe COVID-19 patients are high. Patients with COVID-19 develop ARDS fueled by exaggerated neutrophil influx into the lungs and cytokine storm. B-1a cells represent a unique subpopulation of B lymphocytes critical for circulating natural antibodies, innate immunity, and immunoregulation. These cells spontaneously produce natural IgM, interleukin (IL)-10, and granulocyte-monocyte colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Natural IgM neutralizes viruses and opsonizes bacteria, IL-10 attenuates the cytokine storm, and GM-CSF induces IgM production by B-1a cells in an autocrine manner. Indeed, B-1a cells have been shown to ameliorate influenza virus infection, sepsis, and pneumonia, all of which are similar to COVID-19. The recent discovery of B-1a cells in humans further reinforces their potentially critical role in the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 and their anticipated translational applications against viral and microbial infections. Given that B-1a cells protect against ARDS via immunoglobulin production and the anti-COVID-19 effects of convalescent plasma treatment, we recommend that studies be conducted to further examine the role of B-1a cells in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and explore their therapeutic potential to treat COVID-19 patients.","Aziz, Monowar; Brenner, Max; Wang, Ping",Shock,122,1

Being worn closely attached to the people's face, they are continuously subjected to routine movements, i.e., facial expressions, breathing, and talking. These motional forces represent an unusual source of wasted mechanical energy that can be rather harvested by electromechanical transducers and exploited to power mask-integrated sensors. Typically, piezoelectric and triboelectric nanogenerators are exploited to this aim; however, most of the current devices are too thick or wide, not really conformable, and affected by humidity, which make them hardly embeddable in a mask, in contact with skin. Different from recent attempts to fabricate smart energy-harvesting cloth masks, in this work, a wearable energy harvester is rather enclosed in the mask and can be reused and not disposed. The device is a metal-free hybrid piezoelectric nanogenerator (hPENG) based on soft biocompatible materials. In particular, poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) membranes in the pure form and with a biobased plasticizer (cardanol oil, CA) are electrospun onto a laser-ablated polyimide flexible substrate attached on a skin-conformable elastomeric blend of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) and Ecoflex. The multilayer structure of the device harnesses the piezoelectricity of the PVDF nanofibers and the friction triboelectric effects. The ultrasensitive mechanoelectrical transduction properties of the composite device are determined by the strong electrostatic behavior of the membranes and the plasticization effect of cardanol. In addition, encapsulation based on PVDF, PDMS, CA, and parylene C is used, allowing the hPENG to exhibit optimal reliability and resistance against the wet and warm atmosphere around the face mask. The proposed device reveals potential applications for the future development of smart masks with coupled energy-harvesting devices, allowing to use them not only for anti-infective protection but also to supply sensors or active antibacterial/viral devices.","Mariello, Massimo; Qualtieri, Antonio; Mele, Giuseppe; De Vittorio, Massimo",ACS applied materials & interfaces,122,1

OBJECTIVE This qualitative study uses a socioecological framework to explore factors that influence hospital mobility in older adults. DESIGN Qualitative research PARTICIPANTS: Semi-structured interviews and focus groups were conducted with medically-ill hospitalized older adults (n = 19) and providers (hospitalists, nurses, and physical and occupational therapists (n = 48) at two hospitals associated with an academic health system. APPROACH Interview and focus group guides included questions on perceived need for mobility, communication about mobility, hospital mobility culture, and awareness of patients' walking activity. Data were analyzed thematically and mapped onto the constructs of the socioecological model. KEY RESULTS A consistent theme among patients and providers was that ""mobility is medicine."" Categories of factors reported to influence hospital walking activity included intrapersonal factors (patients' health status, fear of falls), interpersonal factors (patient-provider communication about mobility), organizational factors (clarity about provider roles and responsibilities, knowledge of safe patient handling, reliance on physical therapy for mobility), and environmental factors (falls as a never event, patient geographical locations on hospital units). Several of these factors were identified as potentially modifiable targets for intervention. Patients and providers offered recommendations for improving awareness of patient's ambulatory activity, assigning roles and responsibility for mobility, and enhancing education and communication between patients and providers across disciplines. CONCLUSION Patients and providers identified salient factors for future early mobility initiatives targeting hospitalized older adults. Consideration of these factors across all stages of intervention development and implementation will enhance impact and sustainability.","Pavon, Juliessa M; Fish, Laura J; Colón-Emeric, Cathleen S; Hall, Katherine S; Morey, Miriam C; Pastva, Amy M; Hastings, Susan N",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,122,19

METHODS A retrospective chart review was performed searching for ""optic neuropathy"" and ""optic neuritis,"" cross-referencing patients who had orbital MRI with and without contrast. Cases were excluded with known history of orbital trauma or surgery, previous diagnoses known to affect LG size, and poor image quality. LGs were outlined in consecutive axial and coronal slices, and volumes were generated using OsiriX software; cross-sectional area of the orbit was measured by outlining the bony orbit in largest axial section. RESULTS One hundred orbits from 50 patients were included (26 AAs, 24 whites). Mean LG volumes as measured in coronal and axial section were 0.714 and 0.671 cm, respectively; mean orbital area was 10.42 cm. Axial orbital size was found to be highly correlated (P < 0.01) with LG volume. No significant correlation was found with LG volume and age, sex, race, or laterality. CONCLUSIONS This article presents normal values for LG volumes by MRI of AAs and whites. LG volumes were highly correlated with orbital size, a relationship which has not been explored in the recent literature. Such an assessment of LG size relative to patients' orbital dimensions may be more clinically useful than comparison to population-based measures of normal LG volume alone. We found no statistically significant relationship between LG volume and race, sex, age, or laterality.","Tenzel, Phillip A; Moffa, Diana; Decilveo, Alexander P; Reddy, Harsha S",The Journal of craniofacial surgery,122,11

OBJECTIVE This study aims to examine students' users' attitudes and experiences and clinical facilitators' perspectives on student performances in the clinical setting post-virtual patient training. DESIGN A descriptive qualitative study design was used. SETTING Nursing faculty at a local university in Singapore. PARTICIPANTS 24 nursing undergraduates and six clinical facilitators. METHODS This study is a follow-up of an experimental study on the Virtual Counseling Application Using Artificial Intelligence (VCAAI). The study took place from the academic year 2017/2018 ended in November 2019. Focus group discussions and individual interviews were conducted. All interviews and focus group discussions were audiotaped, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS Two overarching themes (students' virtual patient user experience and clinical facilitators' evaluations of students' clinical communication skills) comprising six themes were generated. Themes under students' user experience included: 1) attitudes toward virtual patient training, 2) virtual patient's role in student development, and 3) enhanced features and implementation suggestions. Themes under clinical facilitators' evaluations included: 1) insights on students' communication skills and 2) approaches to improve communication skills. An overlapping theme titled 'value of technology in teaching communication' comprised of mutual feedback from both students and clinical facilitators. Early implementation, continued accessibility, enhancing realism and technological improvements to the VCAAI were listed as key areas for program improvement, while increased situational sensitivity and language training are recommended to further enhance students' communication skills. CONCLUSION The mixed attitudes toward virtual patient interactions and recognitions of the benefits of virtual patient simulations suggest the potential effectiveness of the use of virtual patients in teaching effective nursing communication skills.

This study explored undergraduate nursing students' resilience, challenges experienced, and supports utilized during the pandemic. Convenience sampling recruited students from one nursing programme (n = 340). Quantitative and qualitative data were collected. The Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC-25) examined resilience scores through non-parametric analysis. Narrative responses were analysed using inductive thematic analysis. 121 surveys (40.3%) were completed. Most participants were from second year (n = 77, 63.6%). The difference in median resilience scores among employed participants was statistically significant (P = 0.029) and higher than the unemployed. The median scores of students working in nursing-related roles were higher than others. Median resilience score across all year levels was 70 (IQR = 62-80), in the lowest score range. Major themes identified were fear of the virus, isolation, and mental health problems. The coping strategies identified were developing daily routines, staying connected, and establishing self-help techniques. This research has implications to optimize students' learning experience, enhance resilience, and promote mental health and well-being.","Hamadeh Kerbage, Samira; Garvey, Loretta; Willetts, Georgina; Olasoji, Michael",International journal of mental health nursing,122,1

Single port access splenectomy (SPAS) emphasizes the concept of surgery through one small incision. The reduced port access splenectomy (RPAS) entails the use of fewer trocars of smaller sizes. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes after LS, SPAS, and RPAS, and to analyze the aesthetic result and patient satisfaction. METHODS We included patients who underwent LS (group 1, n = 15), SPAS (group 2, n = 8), and RPAS (group 3, n = 10) between June 2008 and February 2012, whose final spleen weight was less of 500 g. The outcome parameters analyzed were operative time, need of additional trocars, blood loss, blood transfusion, weight of the spleen, postoperative complications, and duration of hospital stay. To evaluate the cosmetic result, patients were asked to take the Body Image Questionnaire. RESULTS Patients in group 3 were younger than group 1. Operative time was significantly longer in group 2 compared to groups 1 and 3 (83 ± 19 vs. 131 ± 43 vs. 81 ± 22 min, p = 0.01). There was no need to convert to open surgery in any group, nor were there differences in intra- or postoperative outcome. There were no differences between the groups in relation to the analgesic requirements. Twenty-two out of the 33 patients answered the questionnaire. There was a significant advantage in group 2 and 3 in the body image index with respect to group 1. There were no differences between groups 2 and 3 (7.3 ± 2.8 vs. 5.8 ± 1.3 vs. 5.1 ± 0.4, p < 0.02). CONCLUSIONS RPAS is a good alternative to LS and SPAS. It improves the aesthetic results as compared to LS, whereas minimizes the technical challenges faced with SPAS.","Monclova, Julio Lopez; Targarona, Eduardo M; Vidal, Pablo; Peraza, Yerald; Garcia, Francisco; Otero, Carlos Rodriguez; Pallares, Luis; Balague, Carmen; Trias, Manuel",Surgical endoscopy,122,14

The use of genotyping allows the distinction between both. METHODS We did a systematic review and meta-analysis, using four databases to search for studies in English, French and Spanish published between 1 January 1980 and 30 September 2020 that assessed recurrences after TB treatment success and/or differentiated relapses from reinfections using genotyping. We calculated person years of follow-up and performed random-effects model meta-analysis for estimating pooled recurrent TB incidence rates and proportions of relapses and reinfections. We performed subgroup analyses by clinical-epidemiological factors and by methodological study characteristics. FINDINGS The pooled recurrent TB incidence rate was 2.26 per 100 person years at risk (95% CI 1.87 to 2.73; 145 studies). Heterogeneity was high (I2=98%). Stratified pooled recurrence rates increased from 1.47 (95% CI 0.87 to 2.46) to 4.10 (95% CI 2.67 to 6.28) per 100 person years for studies conducted in low versus high TB incidence settings. Background HIV prevalence, treatment drug regimen, sample size and duration of follow-up contributed too. The pooled proportion of relapses was 70% (95% CI 63% to 77%; I²=85%; 48 studies). Heterogeneity was determined by background TB incidence, as demonstrated by pooled proportions of 83% (95% CI 75% to 89%) versus 59% (95% CI 42% to 74%) relapse for studies from settings with low versus high TB incidence, respectively. INTERPRETATION The risk of recurrent TB is substantial and relapse is consistently the most frequent form of recurrence. Notwithstanding, with increasing background TB incidence the proportion of reinfections increases and the predominance of relapses among recurrences decreases.

METHODS This study is supported and endorsed by the Asia Pacific Society of Interventional Cardiology. Due to the inability to have face to face discussions during the pandemic, an online survey was performed by inviting key opinion leaders (cardiac surgeon/interventional cardiologist/echocardiologist) in the field of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in Asia to participate. The answers to a series of questions pertaining to the impact of COVID-19 on TAVI were collected and analyzed. These led subsequently to an expert consensus recommendation on the conduct of TAVI during the pandemic. RESULTS The COVID-19 pandemic had resulted in a 25% (10-80) reduction of case volume and 53% of operators required triaging to manage their patients with severe aortic stenosis. The two most important parameters used to triage were symptoms and valve area. Periprocedural changes included the introduction of teleconsultation, preprocedure COVID-19 testing, optimization of protests, and catheterization laboratory set up. In addition, length of stay was reduced from a mean of 4.4 to 4 days. CONCLUSION The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted on the delivery of TAVI services to patients in Asia. This expert recommendation on best practices may be a useful guide to help TAVI teams during this period until a COVID-19 vaccine becomes widely available.","Tay, Edgar L; Hayashida, Kentaro; Chen, Mao; Yin, Wei-Hsien; Park, Duk-Woo; Seth, Ashok; Kao, Hsien-Li; Lin, Mao-Shin; Ho, Kay-Woon; Buddhari, Wacin; Chandavimol, Mann; Posas, Fabio-Enriques; Nguyen, Quang N; Kong, William; Rosli, M A; Hon, Jimmy; Firman, Doni; Lee, Michael",Journal of cardiac surgery,122,1

Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) have been rapidly increasing as a cause of infections worldwide in recent decades. Numerous reports indicate that S. aureus and MRSA are becoming resistant to many antibiotics, which makes them very dangerous. Therefore, this study retrospectively investigated the resistance to antimicrobial agents in all hospitalized patients suffering from community- or nosocomial-acquired pneumonia due to S. aureus and MRSA. METHODS Information from the study groups suffering from either community- or nosocomial-acquired pneumonia caused by S. aureus or MRSA was gathered by searching records from 2004 to 2014 at the HELIOS Clinic Wuppertal, Witten/Herdecke University, Germany. The findings of antibiotic resistance were analyzed after the evaluation of susceptibility testing for S. aureus and MRSA. RESULTS Total of 147 patients (63.9%, 95% CI 57.5%-69.8%), mean age 67.9 ± 18.5 years, with pneumonia triggered by S. aureus, and 83 patients (36.1%, 95% CI 30.2%-42.5%), mean age 72.3 ± 13.8 years, with pneumonia due to MRSA. S. aureus and MRSA developed no resistance to vancomycin (P = 0.019 vs. < 0.0001, respectively) or linezolid (P = 0.342 vs. < 0.0001, respectively). MRSA (95.3%) and S. aureus (56.3%) showed a high resistance to penicillin. MRSA (87.7%) was also found to have a high antibiotic resistance against ß-lactam antibiotics, compared to S. aureus (9.6%). Furthermore, MRSA compared to S. aureus, respectively, had increased antibiotic resistance to ciprofloxacin (90.1% vs. 17.0%), cefazolin (89.7% vs. 10.2%), cefuroxime (89.0% vs. 9.1%), levofloxacin (88.2% vs. 18.4%), clindamycin (78.0% vs. 14.7%), and erythromycin (76.5% vs. 20.8%). CONCLUSION No development of resistance was found to vancomycin and linezolid in patients with pneumonia caused by S. aureus and MRSA.","Yayan, Josef; Ghebremedhin, Beniam; Rasche, Kurt",PloS one,122,1

A Generalized Additive Model (GAM) was designed to deconvolve factors contributing to the pollutant concentrations at multiple scales. The model yields estimates of source contributions to pollution by separately identifying the signals in the time series due to meteorology, vertical mixing, horizontal wind transport and temporal variations such as diurnal, weekly, seasonal and annual trends. The GAM model was expanded to include FLEXPART back trajectory clusters generated using fuzzy c-means clustering. This made it possible to quantify the impact of long-range transport using the Trajectory Cluster Contribution Function (TCCF). TCCF provides a development of methods such as Concentration Field Analysis and Potential Source Contribution Function by providing numerical estimates of concentration changes associated with different air mass transport patterns while accounting for possible confounding factors from meteorology. The GAM simulations identified the importance of local transport for primary pollutants and long-range transport from China for secondary pollutants. Local factors accounted for up to 72% of the variance in concentrations of NO2 and elemental carbon whereas large-scale/seasonal factors accounted for up to 56% of PM2.5 and 80% of inorganic species. The algorithm further identified the importance of the weekend effect and the holiday effect at the different sites in Busan. The residual from the analysis was used to estimate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The signature of the pandemic was different between the pollutants as well as from site to site. The model was able to distinguish small impacts from local pollutants at the residential site; short-lived acute impacts from industrial changes; and longer-term changes due to the early pandemic response in China.","de Foy, Benjamin; Heo, Jongbae; Kang, Ji-Yoon; Kim, Hwajin; Schauer, James J",The Science of the total environment,122,1

The goal is to quantify the financial impact on families of children with persistent OSA and assess contributing factors. STUDY DESIGN Cross-sectional survey study with comparison group. SETTING Upper airway center at a tertiary pediatric hospital. METHODS Participants included consecutive children with persistent OSA from September to October 2017. Healthy children seen in a general otolaryngology clinic served as controls. Families of both groups completed the Family Impact Questionnaire and the modified Comprehensive Score for Financial Toxicity (COST). RESULTS Families of the 50 patients (25 study and 25 control) completed the surveys: the mean age was 6.4 years (95% CI, 5.0-7.8), and 19 (38%) were female. There were no differences in age, sex, race, or insurance status between groups (P > .05). The mean apnea-hypopnea index for the study group was 7.9 events/h (range, 5.5-10.3), and 40% (10/25) had Down syndrome. Positive airway pressure and/or oxygen were used by 72% (18/25). The Comprehensive Score for Financial Toxicity for study patients (21.9; 95% CI, 14.8-26.0) was significantly lower than for controls (30.2; 95% CI, 26.6-30.8; P = .003), reflecting elevated financial toxicity.

The requirement of patients on dialysis for regular treatment in settings typically not conducive to social distancing may increase their vulnerability to COVID-19. METHODS Over a 6-week period, we recorded new COVID-19 infections and outcomes for all adult patients receiving dialysis in a large dialysis center. Rapidly introduced control measures included a two-stage routine screening process at dialysis entry (temperature and symptom check, with possible cases segregated within the unit and tested for SARS-CoV-2), isolated dialysis in a separate unit for patients with infection, and universal precautions that included masks for dialysis nursing staff. RESULTS Of 1530 patients (median age 66 years; 58.2% men) receiving dialysis, 300 (19.6%) developed COVID-19 infection, creating a large demand for isolated outpatient dialysis and inpatient beds. An analysis that included 1219 patients attending satellite dialysis clinics found that older age was a risk factor for infection. COVID-19 infection was substantially more likely to occur among patients on in-center dialysis compared with those dialyzing at home. We observed clustering in specific units and on specific shifts, with possible implications for aspects of service design, and high rates of nursing staff illness. A predictive epidemic model estimated a reproduction number of 2.2; cumulative cases deviated favorably from the model from the fourth week, suggesting that the implemented measures controlled transmission. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 epidemic affected a large proportion of patients at this dialysis center, creating service pressures exacerbated by nursing staff illness. Details of the control strategy and characteristics of this epidemic may be useful for dialysis providers and other institutions providing patient care.","Corbett, Richard W; Blakey, Sarah; Nitsch, Dorothea; Loucaidou, Marina; McLean, Adam; Duncan, Neill; Ashby, Damien R",Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,122,13

Fall prevention courses are designed to educate participants on fall safety and increase activity levels and social engagement. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to evaluate the perceived effectiveness of a nationally recognized fall prevention course on self-reported fall frequency and lifestyle habits. METHODS This was a single-group pretest-posttest study of a convenience sample of older adults enrolled in a group fall prevention program, A Matter of Balance, in a community setting between March 2019 and March 2020. Questionnaires were distributed at the first and final sessions of the course to evaluate participant perceptions of the program and its impact on their fall history, exercise habits, and social engagement. Comparisons were made using Wilcoxon rank sum tests. RESULTS A total of 40 class members agreed to participate, with 29 (73%) completing both the presurvey and the postsurvey. Responses indicated no change in the number of falls or participants following an established exercise routine. However, of those who fell prior to the course, 75% reported a reduction in falls. In addition, the participants reported an overall increase in weekly exercise frequency. In those who reported fear of falling, 71% reported a reduction in fear following the course. CONCLUSIONS The participants in this study self-reported a decrease in fall rate, a decrease in fear of falling, and an increase in exercise frequency. The course is not fall protective but can be considered an adjunct to fall prevention measures that include medical, medication, visual, and environmental management.","Valatka, Robin; Krizo, Jessica; Mallat, Ali",Journal of trauma nursing : the official journal of the Society of Trauma Nurses,122,30

METHODS In a phase 2, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial involving patients with long-standing, moderate-to-severe major depressive disorder, we compared psilocybin with escitalopram, a selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor, over a 6-week period. Patients were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive two separate doses of 25 mg of psilocybin 3 weeks apart plus 6 weeks of daily placebo (psilocybin group) or two separate doses of 1 mg of psilocybin 3 weeks apart plus 6 weeks of daily oral escitalopram (escitalopram group); all the patients received psychological support. The primary outcome was the change from baseline in the score on the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report (QIDS-SR-16; scores range from 0 to 27, with higher scores indicating greater depression) at week 6. There were 16 secondary outcomes, including QIDS-SR-16 response (defined as a reduction in score of >50%) and QIDS-SR-16 remission (defined as a score of ≤5) at week 6. RESULTS A total of 59 patients were enrolled; 30 were assigned to the psilocybin group and 29 to the escitalopram group. The mean scores on the QIDS-SR-16 at baseline were 14.5 in the psilocybin group and 16.4 in the escitalopram group. The mean (±SE) changes in the scores from baseline to week 6 were -8.0±1.0 points in the psilocybin group and -6.0±1.0 in the escitalopram group, for a between-group difference of 2.0 points (95% confidence interval [CI], -5.0 to 0.9) (P = 0.17). A QIDS-SR-16 response occurred in 70% of the patients in the psilocybin group and in 48% of those in the escitalopram group, for a between-group difference of 22 percentage points (95% CI, -3 to 48); QIDS-SR-16 remission occurred in 57% and 28%, respectively, for a between-group difference of 28 percentage points (95% CI, 2 to 54). Other secondary outcomes generally favored psilocybin over escitalopram, but the analyses were not corrected for multiple comparisons. The incidence of adverse events was similar in the trial groups. CONCLUSIONS On the basis of the change in depression scores on the QIDS-SR-16 at week 6, this trial did not show a significant difference in antidepressant effects between psilocybin and escitalopram in a selected group of patients. Secondary outcomes generally favored psilocybin over escitalopram, but the analyses of these outcomes lacked correction for multiple comparisons. Larger and longer trials are required to compare psilocybin with established antidepressants.

Methods This is a descriptive qualitative study using semi-structured interviews of emergency medicine physicians. Physicians were selected by theoretical sampling from urban, tertiary care pediatric hospitals across the United States until theoretical data saturation was achieved. The study applied a constructivist grounded theory approach to data collection and analysis. Manual line-by-line coding of interview transcripts was used initially, then grouped into categories with constant comparative analysis to generate the final coding scheme organized by themes and subthemes. Finally, memo-writing and iterative analysis meetings explored relationships between themes and identified an interpretive model. Results Theoretical saturation was achieved after 10 of the initial 12 interviews. Emerging from the data were six themes that describe the concept of intubation sharing: (1) Videolaryngoscopy encompasses multiple modalities that all provide a shared view and ability to record; (2) Airway experts and systems help realize the full potential of videolaryngoscopy; (3) Videolaryngoscopy can be a clinical, educational, quality assurance and research tool; (4) Some skills required for videolaryngoscopy are unique, while others overlap with direct laryngoscopy; (5) Videolaryngoscopy allows a coaching laryngoscopist to provide real-time guidance to the primary laryngoscopist from a shared view; (6) Videolaryngoscopy provides an opportunity for post-intubation coaching and feedback and shared learning from a single experience for the provider community. Conclusions Through this multicenter qualitative interview study, we derived the concept of intubation sharing through videolaryngoscopy for real-time and remote coaching, for both the primary laryngoscopist and the community of emergency medicine providers who intubate.","Miller, Kelsey A; Marchese, Ashley; Luff, Donna; Nagler, Joshua",AEM education and training,122,1

The pandemic outbreak represents a significant burden on humankind; yet, life still moves on with approximately 350,000 babies being born every day around the world (UNICEF-2018). Some of these mothers will have other conditions, including COVID-19 infection. As healthcare providers, it is our responsibility to treat all women equal no matter what illness they have and to offer them the best possible conditions to give birth vaginally or via Caesarian section, in a safe environment for them and their babies.

We highlight key studies demonstrating the effectiveness of this technique and discuss current challenges and future directions of automated deep learning. RECENT FINDINGS There are several commercially available automated deep learning platforms. Although specific features differ between platforms, they utilise the common approach of supervised learning. Ophthalmology is an exemplar speciality in the area, with a number of recent proof-of-concept studies exploring classification of retinal fundus photographs, optical coherence tomography images and indocyanine green angiography images. Automated deep learning has also demonstrated impressive results in other specialities such as dermatology, radiology and histopathology. SUMMARY Automated deep learning allows users without coding expertise to develop deep learning algorithms. It is rapidly establishing itself as a valuable tool for those with limited technical experience. Despite residual challenges, it offers considerable potential in the future of patient management, clinical research and medical education.

DATA SOURCES We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PUBMED, and CENTRAL databases. STUDY SELECTION We included randomized controlled trials that directly compared the IV administration of one balanced crystalloid solution with another. DATA EXTRACTION AND ANALYSIS We examined metabolic and patient-important outcomes and conducted meta-analysis using random effects model. For comparisons or outcomes with insufficient data to allow for pooling, we describe results narratively. We assessed risk of bias for individual trials using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and certainty of evidence using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations methodology. DATA SYNTHESIS We included 24 randomized controlled trials comparing Plasmalyte, Ringer's Lactate, Ringerfundin, Hartmann's solution, Ringer's Bicarbonate, Sterofundin, Kabilyte, Normosol, and novel balanced solutions. Of the included studies, 16 were performed in the perioperative setting, six in the ICU, one in the emergency department, and one in healthy volunteers. Administration of Plasmalyte resulted in a lower postinfusion serum chloride concentration (mean difference, 0.83 mmol/L lower; 95% CI, 0.03-1.64 mmol/L lower, low certainty), higher postinfusion base excess (mean difference, 0.65 mmol/L higher, 95% CI, 0.25-1.05 mmol/L higher, low certainty), and lower postinfusion serum lactate levels (mean difference, 0.46 mmol/L lower; 95% CI, 0.05-0.87 mmol/L lower, low certainty) compared with administration of any other balanced crystalloid. There were no important differences in postinfusion serum pH or potassium when comparing Plasmalyte with other balanced crystalloids. Data addressing other comparisons or examining the impact of different balanced crystalloids on patient-important outcomes were sparsely reported and too heterogeneous to allow for pooling. CONCLUSIONS Administration of Plasmalyte results in lower serum concentrations of chloride and lactate, and higher base excess than other balanced crystalloids. The certainty of evidence is low and requires further study in large randomized controlled trials to inform the choice of balanced crystalloid in patients requiring volume replacement.","Curran, Jeffrey D; Major, Paityn; Tang, Kent; Bagshaw, Sean M; Dionne, Joanna C; Menon, Kusum; Rochwerg, Bram",Critical care explorations,122,1

Limited information exists regarding the interrelationship between CD47 expression and tumour-associated macrophage-related immuno-microenvironment in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). These factors may predict novel immunotherapy efficacy. PATIENTS AND METHODS CD47 and PD-L1 expression was retrospectively assessed in 191 resected NSCLC specimens via immunohistochemistry. Forty-six patients with pulmonary infectious diseases were enrolled as the control group. The infiltration of macrophages (M2 and M1) and CD8+ T-lymphocytes was evaluated via dual-immunofluorescence staining. Targeted DNA sequencing was performed on NSCLC specimens. Survival analysis was performed using the Cox model. RESULTS Using 2+/3+ as a CD47 positive (CD47pos) expression cut-off, the prevalence of CD47pos expression in NSCLC was 33.0% (63/191), significantly higher than in pulmonary infectious diseases. CD47pos expression was significantly higher in female, non-smoking and adenocarcinoma patients (p=0.020, p<0.001 and p<0.001, respectively). Furthermore, CD47pos expression was significantly correlated with epidermal growth factor receptor mutation (p<0.001). The expression of CD47 (H-score) in NSCLC was negatively correlated with tumour PD-L1 expression (p=0.0346) and tumour mutation burden (p=0.0107). CD47pos expression was independently correlated with poor disease-free survival in patients with resected NSCLC in multivariate Cox regression analysis (p=0.035). CONCLUSION This study revealed the demographic, molecular and immuno-microenvironment characteristics of CD47 expression in NSCLC. We identified tumour CD47pos expression as an independent prognostic factor for recurrence in resected NSCLC. Our findings illustrate the potential of anti-CD47 treatment in NSCLC.","Xu, Yan; Li, Ji; Tong, Bing; Chen, Minjiang; Liu, Xiaoyan; Zhong, Wei; Zhao, Jing; Wang, Mengzhao",ESMO open,122,12

What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Several studies have shown the feasibility of performing both complex and reconstructive laparoendoscopic single site (LESS) surgical procedures in urology. To date, no studies have evaluated the rates of conversion to conventional laparoscopy and complications at the time of LESS procedures in urology. This study, a compilation of results from members of the NOTES working group, is the first study to address the rates of complications and conversions to conventional laparoscopy at the time of LESS surgery in urology. OBJECTIVE • To present complications and rates of conversion from LESS to conventional laparoscopy (CL) at the time of upper tract LESS urologic procedures. PATIENTS AND METHODS • Patients undergoing LESS upper tract procedures between September, 2007 and November, 2008 (n = 125) were identified at six high-volume academic centers pioneering urologic LESS procedures. All LESS procedures were performed transperitoneally via a single umbilical incision using either adjacent conventional trocars or a dedicated single-site access device. Reconstructive procedures incorporating a single planned 2 mm accessory needle port were included as LESS procedures and were not considered conversions. • Patients, undergoing LESS procedures requiring conversion to CL with the placement of additional ports were identified. Conversion was defined as the placement of additional 5 or 10/12 mm ports beyond the primary incision. In each case the operative reports were reviewed, the reason for conversion was determined, and the number and types of additional ports and complications were noted. RESULTS • Upper tract LESS procedures were performed in 125 patients comprising 13.3% of the total 937 laparoscopic procedures performed at the participating institutions during this time period. Conversion to CL was necessary in 7 patients (5.6%) undergoing LESS requiring the addition of 2-5 ports. • Reasons for conversion included: facilitate dissection in 3 (43%), facilitate reconstruction in 3 (43%), and control of bleeding in 1 (14%). All attempted LESS cases were completed laparoscopically without need for open conversion. • Complications occurred in 15.2% of patients undergoing LESS surgery. Three of the 7 patients that required conversion to CL developed postoperative complications (Clavien grade II in two and IIIa in one). • Limitations of this study included the inability to standardize LESS patient selection criteria, instrumentation and surgical technique as well as the lack of available complete data from a CL control group for comparison. CONCLUSION • LESS surgery is technically feasible for a variety of upper urinary tract reconstructive and ablative procedures, although it appears to be associated with higher rates of complications than in mature CL series. Conversion to CL occurs infrequently and may be a reflection of stringent patient selection.","Irwin, Brian H; Cadeddu, Jeffrey A; Tracy, Chad R; Kim, Fernando J; Molina, Wilson R; Rane, Abhay; Sundaram, Chandru P; Raybourn, James H; Stein, Robert J; Gill, Inderbir S; Kavoussi, Louis R; Richstone, Lee; Desai, Mihir M",BJU international,122,16

RECENT FINDINGS There is a paucity of research regarding pharmacological interventions for adolescents with obesity. These studies have typically reported reductions in weight, and side effects have been inconsistently described. Overall, medication seems to be a safe and effective obesity treatment modality for adolescents with obesity. Six articles were included in this review. Studies varied in medication type, medication dosing, lifestyle components, psychosocial measures, measurement intervals, and psychosocial outcomes. All studies found a reduction in weight and/or BMI. Studies were often underpowered to detect differences in psychosocial variables, which were always considered secondary or exploratory outcomes. Future research should include psychosocial outcomes as a primary endpoint of pharmacological interventions for adolescent obesity. Ultimately, the treatment of the complex disease of obesity deserves to be assessed through multiple health domains extending beyond weight reduction.","Dillard, Jackson R; Newsome, Faith A; Kelly, Aaron S; Gross, Amy C; Morgan-Daniel, Jane; Adkins, Lauren E; Madem, Sweta S; Cardel, Michelle I",Current nutrition reports,122,22

Iron deficiency is an important cause of anemia in patients on hemodialysis (HD). However, it has not been clarified whether these patients might have small intestinal mucosal lesions causing iron deficiency anemia. METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional study in -asymptomatic patients on HD between April 2014 and -December 2015. We performed small bowel capsule endoscopy (SBCE) and analyzed the relationship between small intestinal endoscopic findings and anemia. RESULTS SBCE was successfully completed in 39 eligible patients. Univariate analysis revealed that there was a significant difference in blood hemoglobin levels between the morbid SBCE-finding group (median 7.7 g/dL; range 6.7-9.2 g/dL) and the non-morbid SBCE-finding group (median 10.65 g/dL; range 6.4-13.1 g/dL; p = 0.0006, Mann-Whitney U test). On multivariate analysis, the blood hemoglobin level was an independent predictor of morbid SBCE findings (p = 0.0033). The cutoff value of blood hemoglobin level for the morbid SBCE finding was determined as 9.2 g/dL using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. CONCLUSIONS Patients on HD with anemia are at a high risk of small intestinal lesions. Since the control of small intestinal lesion may improve the anemia, these outcomes are significant factors for managing patients on HD.","Ozaki, Haruhiko; Ota, Kazuhiro; Kojima, Yuichi; Harada, Satoshi; Takeuchi, Toshihisa; Tanaka, Masaya; Hayashi, Katsuyoshi; Higuchi, Kazuhide",Digestion,122,31

During the past 17 years, six therapeutic drugs for MS were brought to market. All of these disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) have shown a beneficial effect in reducing the number of exacerbations in double-blind placebo-controlled trials, and three drugs (subcutaneous [SC]/IM interferon beta-1a, natalizumab) have been shown to reduce relapses, decrease MRI activity, and reduce the risk of sustained disability after 2 years of treatment. No controlled studies exist to show long-term benefit with any of the current DMTs. Immunosuppressive drug (ISD) therapies continue to play a role in the management of patients who fail to respond to immunomodulatory agents. These agents, however, have shown mixed data in terms of efficacy and put patients at higher risk for the development of secondary cancers. Plasma exchange for severe relapses not responsive to corticosteroid therapy has regained interest in the past few years. Furthermore, six new agents that will dramatically impact our ability to prevent disability in patients with MS are in late-stage or have completed phase 3 clinical development. Determining the risk-benefit calculations that we will need to employ toward these new drugs and the algorithms for switching therapies will be critical issues in the next 5 years. This article highlights the clinical efficacy of the current DMTs/ISDs and discusses the current treatment options for clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), and exacerbations of RRMS. It also addresses the management of a suboptimal response to the DMTs; discusses the challenge of primary progressive MS; and presents an overview of emerging therapeutic options.","Greenberg, Benjamin M; Khatri, Bhupendra O; Kramer, John F",Continuum,122,1

We evaluate the risk of mortality, cardiovascular events, and hepatic outcomes between dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor users and nonusers in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cirrhosis. METHODS We selected 2828 paired propensity score matched DPP-4 inhibitor users and nonusers from a cohort of T2DM with compensated liver cirrhosis between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2012. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the risk of main outcomes for DPP-4 inhibitor users. RESULTS The incidence rate of decompensated cirrhosis during follow-up was 2.20 and 1.53 per 100 patient-years (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03-1.77) for DPP-4 inhibitor users and nonusers, respectively. The aHRs (95% CI) of variceal bleeding and hepatic failure were 1.67 (1.11-2.52) and 1.35 (1.02-1.79), respectively, for DPP-4 inhibitor users over nonusers. The risk of all-cause mortality, hepatocellular carcinoma, and major cardiovascular events between DPP-4 inhibitor users and nonusers were not statistically different. CONCLUSIONS This study found that DPP-4 inhibitor users were associated with higher risks of decompensated cirrhosis and hepatic failure than did nonusers among patients with T2DM and compensated liver cirrhosis. We must continue to search for appropriate antidiabetic drugs for patients with liver cirrhosis.","Yen, Fu-Shun; Wei, James Cheng-Chung; Yip, Hei-Tung; Hwu, Chii-Min; Hou, Ming-Chih; Hsu, Chih-Cheng",Hepatology international,122,16

Recently, we discovered a subset of murine ETPs that expresses the IL-4Rα/IL-13Rα1 heteroreceptor (HR) and commits only to the myeloid lineage. This is because IL-4/IL-13 signaling through the HR inhibits their T cell potential and enacts commitment of HR+ETPs to thymic resident CD11c+CD8α+ dendritic cells (DCs). In this study, we discovered that HR+-ETP-derived DCs function as APCs in the thymus and promote deletion of myelin-reactive T cells. Furthermore, this negative T cell selection function of HR+-ETP-derived DCs sustains protection against experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, a mouse model for human multiple sclerosis.

The Contour device is designed to target the neck of an aneurysm and cause flow disruption within the aneurysm hence promoting thrombosis and neo-endothelialization at the neck. This article presents initial experiences with the Contour. METHODS The prospectively maintained database was retrospectively reviewed to identify patients treated with the Contour device. Demographic data, aneurysm characteristics, clinical result, and clinical and radiological follow-up information were recorded. RESULTS The review identified 3 patients (2 female), with 3 unruptured aneurysms, of average age 67 ± 8.7 years (range 62-77 years). The aneurysms were all located in the anterior circulation including one pericallosal, one at the A1-2 junction and one on the ICA bifurcation. The mean average dome height was 7.6 ± 0.62 mm (range 7.1-8.3 mm), dome width 5.7 ± 2 mm (range 3.5-7.5 mm), and neck width 3.6 ± 0.95 mm (range 2.5-4.2 mm). At follow-up angiography two of the aneurysms were completely occluded and one device had displaced into the aneurysm sac due to inappropriate positioning of the device. Of the patients one had minor stroke during the postoperative period but returned to baseline neurology. All patients were mRS 0 at last follow-up. CONCLUSION The Contour is a promising new aneurysm occlusion device. Further studies with longer term follow-up are required to determine the efficacy of this novel device.","Bhogal, P; Lylyk, I; Chudyk, J; Perez, N; Bleise, C; Lylyk, P",Clinical neuroradiology,122,17

Of 7436 studies identified through database searching, and one additional study located through hand searching of reference lists, the final library consisted of 13 studies. All studies reported benefits for student learning from patient involvement, while one paper identified patient benefits from student interventions. Patients as recipients of care mostly contributed in a passive role in student education activities. Quality assessment identified methodological limitations in most studies. Patient involvement in the education of dietitians supports skill development and therefore progression to professional practice. Although nutrition and dietetics education has a focus on client-centred care, the translation of these concepts into an interactive student educational experience has been investigated to a limited extent. Collaboration with patients in student education is an area for further development.","Porter, Judi; Kellow, Nicole; Anderson, Amanda; Bryce, Andrea; Dart, Janeane; Palermo, Claire; Volders, Evelyn; Gibson, Simone",Nutrients,122,1

While measures to improve air quality in megacities such as Delhi are typically aimed at reducing levels of particulate matter (PM), ozone could become a greater threat if these measures focus on PM alone, as some air pollution mitigation steps can actually lead to an increase in surface ozone. A better understanding of the factors controlling ozone production in Delhi and the impact that PM mitigation measures have on ozone is therefore critical for improving air quality. Here, we combine in situ observations and model analysis to investigate the impact of PM reduction on the non-linear relationship between volatile organic compounds (VOC), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and ozone. In situ measurements of NOx, VOC, and ozone were conducted in Delhi during the APHH-India programme in summer (June) and winter (November) 2018. We observed hourly averaged ozone concentrations in the city of up to 100 ppbv in both seasons. We performed sensitivity simulations with a chemical box model to explore the impacts of PM on the non-linear VOC-NOx-ozone relationship in each season through its effect on aerosol optical depth (AOD). We find that ozone production is limited by VOC in both seasons, and is particularly sensitive to solar radiation in winter. Reducing NOx alone increases ozone, such that a 50% reduction in NOx emissions leads to 10-50% increase in surface ozone. In contrast, reducing VOC emissions can reduce ozone efficiently, such that a 50% reduction in VOC emissions leads to ∼60% reduction in ozone. Reducing PM alone also increases ozone, especially in winter, by reducing its dimming effects on photolysis, such that a 50% reduction in AOD can increase ozone by 25% and it also enhances VOC-limitation. Our results highlight the importance of reducing VOC emissions alongside PM to limit ozone pollution, as well as benefitting control of PM pollution through reducing secondary organic aerosol. This will greatly benefit the health of citizens and the local ecosystem in Delhi, and could have broader application for other megacities characterized by severe PM pollution and VOC-limited ozone production.","Chen, Ying; Beig, Gufran; Archer-Nicholls, Scott; Drysdale, Will; Acton, W Joe F; Lowe, Douglas; Nelson, Beth; Lee, James; Ran, Liang; Wang, Yu; Wu, Zhijun; Sahu, Saroj Kumar; Sokhi, Ranjeet S; Singh, Vikas; Gadi, Ranu; Nicholas Hewitt, C; Nemitz, Eiko; Archibald, Alex; McFiggans, Gordon; Wild, Oliver",Faraday discussions,122,16

This study reports clinical outcomes of GICAs untolerate internal carotid artery occlusion tests. METHODS Between January 2012 and September 2017, 14 consecutive cases of GICAs untolerated internal carotid artery occlusion test were retrospectively reviewed. A total of nine patients were not treated and five patients were treated using a Pipeline Embolization Device. RESULTS Of the 14 patients, 12 had compression symptoms and 2 were incidental. In nine untreated patients, during 34 months' (range, 7-64 months) follow-up, four worsened to headaches or ablepsia (more than 34 months). One patient, who presented with ophthalmoplegia and diplopia, showed spontaneous resolution of symptoms at 32-month follow-up. Symptoms in four patients remained unchanged during less than 36-month follow-up period. In five (100%, 95% confidence interval 57% to 100%) treated patients, symptoms recovered completely during 11 months' follow-up after transient worsening of mass compression. CONCLUSIONS GICAs frequently result in intractable cranial neuropathy requiring treatment. The Pipeline Embolization Device is an effective option for these complex aneurysms in selective cases.","Lv, Xianli; Yu, Jianjun; Liao, Ting; Wang, Jin; Wang, Guihuai",The neuroradiology journal,122,31

Most recent decades have seen exponential increases in nearly all environments, including rural/remote areas and lower atmospheric regions. Because of unique physiologies, some species of flora and fauna are sensitive to exogenous EMF in ways that may surpass human reactivity. There is limited, but comprehensive, baseline data in the U.S. from the 1980s against which to compare significant new surveys from different countries. This now provides broader and more precise data on potential transient and chronic exposures to wildlife and habitats. Biological effects have been seen broadly across all taxa and frequencies at vanishingly low intensities comparable to today's ambient exposures. Broad wildlife effects have been seen on orientation and migration, food finding, reproduction, mating, nest and den building, territorial maintenance and defense, and longevity and survivorship. Cyto- and geno-toxic effects have been observed. The above issues are explored in three consecutive parts: Part 1 questions today's ambient EMF capabilities to adversely affect wildlife, with more urgency regarding 5G technologies. Part 2 explores natural and man-made fields, animal magnetoreception mechanisms, and pertinent studies to all wildlife kingdoms. Part 3 examines current exposure standards, applicable laws, and future directions. It is time to recognize ambient EMF as a novel form of pollution and develop rules at regulatory agencies that designate air as 'habitat' so EMF can be regulated like other pollutants. Wildlife loss is often unseen and undocumented until tipping points are reached. Long-term chronic low-level EMF exposure standards, which do not now exist, should be set accordingly for wildlife, and environmental laws should be strictly enforced.","Levitt, B Blake; Lai, Henry C; Manville, Albert M",Reviews on environmental health,122,16

Understanding and developing rational treatments for cancer requires a definition of the key molecular targets and how they interact to elicit the complex growth deregulation phenotype. Viral proteins provide discerning and powerful probes to understand both how cells work and how they can be manipulated using a minimal number of components. The small DNA viruses have evolved to target inherent weaknesses in cellular protein interaction networks to hijack the cellular DNA and protein replication machinery. In the battle to escape the inevitability of senescence and programmed cell death, cancers have converged on similar mechanisms, through the acquisition and selection of somatic mutations that drive unchecked cellular replication in tumors. Understanding the dynamic mechanisms through which a minimal number of viral proteins promote host cells to undergo unscheduled and pathological replication is a powerful strategy to identify critical targets that are also disrupted in cancer. Viruses can therefore be used as tools to probe the system-wide protein-protein interactions and structures that drive growth deregulation in human cells. Ultimately this can provide a path for developing system context-dependent therapeutics. This review will describe ongoing experimental approaches using viruses to study pathways deregulated in cancer, with a particular focus on viral cellular protein-protein interactions and structures.","Ou, Horng D; May, Andrew P; O'Shea, Clodagh C",Wiley interdisciplinary reviews.

Breast Cancer (BC) patients are concerned both with BC treatment and COVID-19. This study aimed to estimate the impact of anxiety among patients, caused by the spreading of COVID-19. PATIENTS AND METHODS Between the 16th of January and the 20th of March 2020, we retrospectively enrolled 160 patients. Eighty-two patients with a suspected breast lesion (SBL) were divided into two groups: PRE-COVID-19-SBL and POST-COVID-19-SBL. Seventy-eight BC patients were divided into PRE-COVID-19-BC and POST-COVID-19-BC. Patient characteristics including age, marital status, SBL/BC diameter, personal and family history of BC, clinical stage and molecular subtype were recorded. Procedure Refusal (PR) and Surgical Refusal (SR) were also recorded with their reason. RESULTS BC and SBL analysis showed no difference in pre-treatment characteristics (p>0.05). Both POST-COVID-19-SBL and POST-COVID-19-BC groups showed higher rates of PR and SR (p=0.0208, p=0.0065 respectively). Infection risk represented primary reason for refusal among POST-COVID-19 patients.

Long mesh is a synthetic T-shaped mesh, with the body fixed at the uterine cervix and the two arms fixed along the bilateral round ligaments. The clinical evaluations performed before and 6 months after surgery included pelvic examinations, urodynamic studies, and questionnaires for urinary and sexual symptoms. After a follow-up time of 12 to 24 months, the anatomical reduction rate was 92% (23/25) for the apical compartment. The average operative time was 65.4 ± 28.8 minutes. No major complications were recognized during LLMS. The lower urinary tract symptoms and scores on the questionnaires improved significantly after the surgery, except urgency urinary incontinence and nocturia. Neither voiding nor storage dysfunction was observed after the operations. All of the domains and total Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) scores of the 15 sexually active women did not differ significantly after LLMS.

Little is known of the surface properties of the hydrogel, although we observe fascinating tribological behavior in biological soft tissues, such as extremely low friction between animal cartilages. We consider that the role of the solvated polymer network existing in the extracellular matrix as a gel state is critically important in the specific frictional behavior of cartilages. In order to elucidate the general tribological features of a solvated polymer matrix, the friction of various kinds of hydrogels has been investigated, and very rich and complex frictional behaviors are observed. The friction force and its dependence on the load differ with the chemical structure of the gels, surface properties of the opposing substrates, and the measurement conditions, which are totally different from those of solids. Most importantly, the coefficient of friction of gels, , varies over a wide range and exhibits very low values (≈ 10-10), which cannot be obtained from the friction between two solid materials. A repulsion-adsorption model has been proposed to explain the gel friction, which says that the friction is due to lubrication of a hydrated layer of polymer chains when the polymer chain of the gel is non-adhesive (repulsive) to the substrate, and the friction is due to elastic deformation of the adsorbed polymer chain when it is adhesive to the substrate.","Gong, Jian Ping",Soft matter,122,30

In many countries, regulatory councils for health professionals guide the development and implementation of health workforce policy, but struggle to perform their responsibilities, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Few studies have analyzed the influence of colonialism on modern-day regulatory policy for health workforces in LMICs. Drawing on the example of regulatory policy from India, the goals of this paper is to uncover and highlight the colonial legacies of persistent challenges in medical education and practice within the country, and provide lessons for regulatory policy in India and other LMICs. MAIN BODY Drawing on peer-reviewed and gray literature, this paper explores the colonial origins of the regulation of medical education and practice in India. We describe three major aspects: (1) Evolution of the structure of the apex regulatory council for doctors-the Medical Council of India (MCI); (2) Reciprocity of medical qualifications between the MCI and the General Medical Council (GMC) in the UK following independence from Britain; (3) Regulatory imbalances between doctors and other cadres, and between biomedicine and Indian systems of medicine. CONCLUSIONS Challenges in medical education and professional regulation remain a major obstacle to improve the availability, retention and quality of health workers in India and many other LMICs. We conclude that the colonial origins of regulatory policy in India provide critical insight into contemporary debates regarding reform. From a policy perspective, we need to carefully interrogate why our existing policies are framed in particular ways, and consider whether that framing continues to suit our needs in the twenty-first century.","Sriram, Veena; Keshri, Vikash R; Kumbhar, Kiran",Human resources for health,122,1

This function is driven by neural interactions in the entorhinal cortical-hippocampal network, especially the neural input from the pyramidal cells in layer III of medial entorhinal cortex (MECIII) to hippocampal CA1 is crucial for TAL. Successful TAL depends on the strength of event stimuli and the duration of the temporal gap between events. Whereas it has been demonstrated that the neural input from pyramidal cells in layer II of MEC, referred to as Island cells, to inhibitory neurons in dorsal hippocampal CA1 controls TAL when the strength of event stimuli is weak, it remains unknown whether Island cells regulate TAL with long trace periods as well. To understand the role of Island cells in regulating the duration of the learnable trace period in TAL, we used Pavlovian trace fear conditioning (TFC) with a 60-sec long trace period (long trace fear conditioning [L-TFC]) coupled with optogenetic and chemogenetic neural activity manipulations as well as cell type-specific neural ablation. We found that ablation of Island cells in MECII partially increases L-TFC performance. Chemogenetic manipulation of Island cells causes differential effectiveness in Island cell activity and leads to a circuit imbalance that disrupts L-TFC. However, optogenetic terminal inhibition of Island cell input to dorsal hippocampal CA1 during the temporal association period allows for long trace intervals to be learned in TFC. These results demonstrate that Island cells have a critical role in regulating the duration of time bridgeable between associated events in TAL.","Yokose, Jun; Marks, William D; Yamamoto, Naoki; Ogawa, Sachie K; Kitamura, Takashi",Learning & memory,122,13

Areas covered: This review aims to comprehensively describe multisystem inflammatory syndromes affecting children during Coronaviruses outbreak, and to evaluate the possible pathogenic role of human Coronaviridae in KD and KD-like syndromes. Expert opinion: An increased incidence of PIMS-TS, during the Covid-19 pandemic has been reported, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may trigger a severe hyper-inflammatory syndrome in childhood. The pathophysiological mechanisms of this disease are still unclear. Based on these findings, SARS-CoV-2 may be considered another trigger in the complex mosaic about the relationship among infectious agents and the occurrence of systemic hyper-inflammation related syndromes.","Berardicurti, Onorina; Conforti, Alessandro; Ruscitti, Piero; Cipriani, Paola; Giacomelli, Roberto",Expert review of clinical immunology,122,1

SGB may be present in up to 40% of reflux symptoms in PPI-refractory GERD. Most reports on SGB have come from Western countries, and little is known about the prevalence and relevance of SGB in Asian refractory GERD patients. This study aimed at comparing the role of SGB in GERD patients in Japan and the UK. METHODS We re-analyzed impedance-pH monitoring tracings from patients who were referred to tertiary centers in Japan and the UK due to PPI-refractory reflux symptoms. The prevalence of excessive SGB and the impact of SGB on reflux symptoms were compared between the two countries. RESULTS Impedance-pH tracings from124 Japanese and 83 British patients were re-analyzed. Japanese patients were significantly younger and had smaller body mass index than the British (P < 0.001). Japanese patients had significantly lower prevalence of excessive SGB (18.5%) than the UK (36.1%) irrespective of reflux phenotype (P = 0.006). Logistic regression analysis showed that the geographical/cultural difference was the only factor associated with the different prevalence of SGB (odds ratio; 2.91, 95% CI 1.09-7.73, P = 0.032). SGB were related to typical reflux symptoms very rarely in Japan [0% (0-4.9)] compared to the UK [35% (0-54.1)] (P = 0.071). CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of SGB and their impact on reflux symptoms is significantly lower in Japan compared to the UK.

METHODS This cross-sectional study was done to compare the performance of two pulse oximeter technologies - Signal Extraction Technology (SET), and Resistor Calibration (RCAL) technology on 150 inborn, term neonates at birth. Probes of both pulse oximeters were connected to the pre-ductal limb and the time taken to obtain a reliable reading was recorded. Sequential saturation values were recorded every minute till ten minutes of life. Statistical analysis was done with Mann-Whitney U test and intraclass correlation coefficient was calculated. RESULTS Pulse oximeter with SET recorded reliable readings faster than RCAL technology - Median (IQR) 32 (21-60)s vs. 45 (21.75-105)s, p = 0.021. There was a significant difference in the time to record first saturation readings of the two pulse oximeters when used in normal deliveries [RCAL vs. SET-Median (IQR) 50s (25-120.75) vs. 32.5s (21.75-58.25), p = 0.004] but no such difference was observed in Lower Segment Cesarean section (LSCS) [RCAL vs. SET Median (IQR) 35.5s (18.25-70.75) vs. 31s (20-69.75), p = 0.968]. Sequential saturation readings for every minute for the first 10 min of life were higher with SET vs. RCAL technology.

This tutorial reviews (a) what has been reported about neurological insults in cases of COVID-19 infection, (b) what is known from similar conditions in other disorders, and (c) how that combined information can inform clinical decision making. Method PubMed and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for COVID-19 or other coronavirus infections, cognitive impairment observed following critical care, and disorders for which intermittent or chronic hypoxia is characteristic. These were combined with searches relating to cognition, brain, and communication. All searches were conducted between April 8 and May 23, 2020. Meta-analyses and randomized clinical trials addressing other critical illnesses were also included to extend findings to potential cognitive communication outcomes following COVID-19. Results COVID-19 infection results in a combination of (a) respiratory infection with mechanical ventilation secondary to inadequate oxygenation, (b) inflammatory system reactivity, and (c) increased blood clotting factors. These affect central nervous system function incurring long-term cognitive communication impairment in a proportion of survivors. Diagnostic and intervention approaches for such impairments are discussed. Conclusions The existing literature on cognitive sequela of COVID-19 infection is small to date, but much can be learned from similar viral infections and disorders. Although COVID-19 is novel, the speech-language pathology approaches to evaluation and intervention of other populations of critical care patients are applicable. However, speech-language pathologists have not routinely been involved in these patients' acute care. As such, this is a call to action to speech-language pathologists to address the unprecedented numbers of patients who will need their services early in the disease process and throughout recovery.","Ramage, Amy E",American journal of speech-language pathology,122,1

A public survey involving 1,375 respondents was conducted in Anhui Province, China, during the 2013 H7N9 outbreak to test the research model and hypotheses. The results indicate that protective, stakeholder, and risk perceptions influence positively an individual's willingness to take recommended actions. Protective and stakeholder perceptions also have a positive bearing on lay people's risk perceptions. A stakeholder perception is a vital determinant of a protective perception. More importantly, the effects of protective and stakeholder perceptions on behavioural responses to recommendations are mediated in part by risk perception. These findings can help public health officials to develop messages to encourage members of the population to protect themselves effectively during an influenza crisis.","Wang, Fei; Wei, Jiuchang; Shi, Xing",Disasters,122,16

OBJECTIVE To report on a series of patients whose stent retriever thrombectomy was complicated by intraprocedural vessel perforation and discuss its potential mechanisms, rescue treatment strategies, and clinical significance. METHODS Cases with intraprocedural vessel perforation, where a stent retriever was used either as a primary treatment approach or as a part of a direct aspiration first pass technique (ADAPT), were included in the final analysis. Clinical data, procedural details, radiographic and clinical outcomes were collected from nine participating centers. RESULTS Intraprocedural vessel perforation during stent retriever thrombectomy occurred in 16 (1.0%) of 1599 cases. 63% of intraprocedural perforations occurred at distal locations. Endovascular rescue techniques (most commonly, intracranial balloon occlusion for tamponade) were attempted in 50% of cases. Procedure was aborted without any rescue attempts in 44% of cases. Mortality during hospitalization and at 3 months was 56% and 63%, respectively. 25% of patients achieved good functional outcome at 3 months after the procedure. CONCLUSIONS Intraprocedural perforations during stent retriever thrombectomy were rare, but when they occurred were associated with high mortality. Perforations most commonly occurred at distal occlusion sites and were often characterized by difficulty traversing the occlusion with a microcatheter or microwire, or while withdrawing the stent retriever. Nevertheless, 25% of patients had a favorable functional outcome, suggesting that in some patients with this complication good neurological recovery is achievable.","Mokin, Maxim; Fargen, Kyle M; Primiani, Christopher T; Ren, Zeguang; Dumont, Travis M; Brasiliense, Leonardo B C; Dabus, Guilherme; Linfante, Italo; Kan, Peter; Srinivasan, Visish M; Binning, Mandy J; Gupta, Rishi; Turk, Aquilla S; Elijovich, Lucas; Arthur, Adam; Shallwani, Hussain; Levy, Elad I; Siddiqui, Adnan H",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,122,1

The perforating cerebral arteries and intracranial stents have not been previously visualized with an OCT catheter. METHODS Using a standard transfemoral endovascular technique, a LightLab C7 Dragonfly catheter was inserted in the middle and posterior cerebral arteries of a fresh frozen cadaver. OCT images of the cerebral vessels and a deployed Pipeline Embolization Device were acquired using the LightLab C7-XR OCT Intravascular Imaging System. RESULTS Distal cerebral artery access with the imaging catheter was feasible via the femoral artery using a distal access catheter instead of the standard monorail system used in coronary investigations. Imaging of perforators and stent struts had exceptional resolution. CONCLUSION The first use of a commercial OCT catheter in the evaluation of intracranial vessels using transfemoral endovascular techniques is described. Challenges of intracranial OCT include blood clearance and vessel tortuosity.

Although the successful use of this technique is well reported in general surgery and urology, there is a lack of studies on SILS in gynaecology. AIMS To evaluate the feasibility, safety, cosmesis and outcome of SILS in gynaecology. METHODS A prospective case series analysis of 105 women scheduled to undergo surgery by SILS from August 2010 to November 2011. Intra-operative data such as operative time, estimated blood loss, complications, additional ports and hospital stay were collected. Post-operative pain and cosmetic outcomes (scar size) were also recorded. RESULTS Out of 105 women, SILS was performed for 84 (60 excisions of endometriosis, 13 divisions of adhesions, five hysterectomies, two mesh sacrohysteropexies and four ovarian cystectomies). SILS was not undertaken for 21 women because of a number of factors, including the lack of required equipment (eg bariatric scope, SILS port, roticulating instruments and diathermy leads). Four women required insertion of additional ports because of surgical difficulties. One intra-operative (uterine perforation) and seven post-operative complications (six wound infections and one vault haematoma) occurred. Mean operation times were as follows: mesh sacrohysteropexy - 60 min, excision of endometriosis - 55 min, hysterectomy - 150 min, laparoscopic division of adhesions - 62 min and ovarian cystectomy - 40 min. CONCLUSIONS Our experience shows that SILS is a feasible and safe technique for the surgical management of various gynaecological conditions.

Interindividual heterogeneity evokes variable functional outcome complicating targeted therapy. We aimed to characterize infarct chemokine CXC-motif receptor 4 (CXCR4) expression using positron emission tomography (PET) and establish its relationship to cardiac outcome. We tested whether image-guided early CXCR4 directed therapy attenuates chronic dysfunction. METHODS AND RESULTS Mice (n = 180) underwent coronary ligation or sham surgery and serial PET imaging over 7 days. Infarct CXCR4 content was elevated over 3 days after MI compared with sham (%ID/g, Day 1:1.1 ± 0.2; Day 3:0.9 ± 0.2 vs. 0.6 ± 0.1, P < 0.001), confirmed by flow cytometry and histopathology. Mice that died of left ventricle (LV) rupture exhibited persistent inflammation at 3 days compared with survivors (1.2 ± 0.3 vs. 0.9 ± 0.2% ID/g, P < 0.001). Cardiac magnetic resonance measured cardiac function. Higher CXCR4 signal at 1 and 3 days independently predicted worse functional outcome at 6 weeks (rpartial = -0.4, P = 0.04). Mice were treated with CXCR4 blocker AMD3100 following the imaging timecourse. On-peak CXCR4 blockade at 3 days lowered LV rupture incidence vs. untreated MI (8% vs. 25%), and improved contractile function at 6 weeks (+24%, P = 0.01). Off-peak CXCR4 blockade at 7 days did not improve outcome. Flow cytometry analysis revealed lower LV neutrophil and Ly6Chigh monocyte content after on-peak treatment. Patients (n = 50) early after MI underwent CXCR4 PET imaging and functional assessment. Infarct CXCR4 expression in acute MI patients correlated with contractile function at time of PET and on follow-up. CONCLUSION Positron emission tomography imaging identifies early CXCR4 up-regulation which predicts acute rupture and chronic contractile dysfunction. Imaging-guided CXCR4 inhibition accelerates inflammatory resolution and improves outcome. This supports a molecular imaging-based theranostic approach to guide therapy after MI.","Hess, Annika; Derlin, Thorsten; Koenig, Tobias; Diekmann, Johanna; Wittneben, Alexander; Wang, Yong; Wester, Hans-Juergen; Ross, Tobias L; Wollert, Kai C; Bauersachs, Johann; Bengel, Frank M; Thackeray, James T",European heart journal,122,16

RESULTS In-hospital care for SG-operated females was decreased for four groups of obesity-related ICD-10 diagnoses: endocrine and metabolic diseases and circulatory, digestive, and genitourinary diseases, as well as injuries and poisoning (p < 0.001 for all). However, female SG patients still required in-hospital care above the national level for women of corresponding ages.

Cognitive impairment is a cardinal feature of all types of dementia and DLB presents with a distinct profile with deficits in attention, executive function, and visuoperceptual abilities. This difference from Alzheimer's disease and the common presence of neuropsychiatric symptoms may lead to challenges in predicting cognitive decline in this patient population. Firstly, the diagnosis of DLB is often delayed in clinical practice leading to variability from which time point in the disease course cognitive decline is measured. Secondly, the most frequently used measurement tools for cognitive difficulties focus on memory and naming rather than the domains affected by DLB. While there is now largely a consensus which tools are useful in diagnosing DLB, their validity in assessing deteriorating cognition is less clear. Thirdly, the presence of fluctuating cognition, the propensity to develop delirium episodes, as well as difficulties in distinguishing the two entities in clinical practice make it difficult to predict the disease course. Sleep disturbances are likely to influence cognitive decline but require further study in patients within established DLB. Fourthly, as in most cases of dementia, neuropathological comorbidities are frequently present in DLB. While the influence of Alzheimer's pathology on cognitive decline in DLB is comparatively well understood, the impact of other pathologies remains unclear. The recent definition of research criteria for mild cognitive impairment in DLB could facilitate earlier diagnosis and more structured follow-up. Assessment tools measuring cognitive domains predominantly affected in DLB need to be more consistently used in longitudinal studies and clinical practice, as well as concurrent measures of fluctuations in cognition. Greater availability of biomarkers and digital healthcare solutions can play an important role in enabling more accurate monitoring and prediction of cognitive decline in DLB.","Tsamakis, Konstantinos; Mueller, Christoph",Dementia and geriatric cognitive disorders,122,16

This case report describes a first experience caring for a patient with COVID-19 who received venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and expands the literature by discussing relevant nursing management and operational considerations. CLINICAL FINDINGS A 46-year-old man presented to a hospital emergency department with pleuritic chest pain, dyspnea, anorexia, and chills. The patient was intubated for pneumonia-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome. DIAGNOSIS A nasopharyngeal swab specimen was positive for SARS-CoV-2, and chest radiography confirmed a diagnosis of COVID-19 with acute respiratory distress syndrome. INTERVENTIONS After no improvement with mechanical ventilation and prone positioning, the patient began receiving venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and was transferred to an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation center. Frontline critical care nurses played a vital role in coordinating patient care activities, monitoring changes in the patient's condition, and detecting complications early.

In this report, we demonstrate that the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), a crucial chromatin organizer, is essential for Schwann cell myelination and myelin regeneration after nerve injury. Inhibition of CTCF or its deletion blocks Schwann cell differentiation at the pro-myelinating stage, whereas overexpression of CTCF promotes the myelination program. We find that CTCF establishes chromatin interaction loops between enhancer and promoter regulatory elements and promotes expression of a key pro-myelinogenic factor EGR2. In addition, CTCF interacts with SUZ12, a component of polycomb-repressive-complex 2 (PRC2), to repress the transcriptional program associated with negative regulation of Schwann cell maturation. Together, our findings reveal a dual role of CTCF-dependent chromatin organization in promoting myelinogenic programs and recruiting chromatin-repressive complexes to block Schwann cell differentiation inhibitors to control peripheral myelination and repair.","Wang, Jincheng; Wang, Jiajia; Yang, Lijun; Zhao, Chuntao; Wu, Laiman Natalie; Xu, Lingli; Zhang, Feng; Weng, Qinjie; Wegner, Michael; Lu, Q Richard",Nature communications,122,5

However, limited research has examined the impact of different commercial bowel preparations (CBPs) on IBP and adenoma detection. We aim to determine whether type of CBP used is associated with IBP or adenoma detection. METHODS We retrospectively evaluated outpatient, screening or surveillance colonoscopies performed in the Cleveland Clinic health system between January 2011 and June 2017. IBP was defined by the Aronchick scale. Multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression was performed to assess the association between CBP type and IBP and adenoma detection. Fixed effects were defined as demographics, comorbidities, medication use, and colonoscopy factors. Random effect of individual endoscopist was considered. RESULTS Of 153,639 colonoscopies, 75,874 records met inclusion criteria. Median age was 54; 50% were female; 17.7% had IBP, and adenoma detection rate was 32.6%.

The aim was to conduct a meta-analysis of publications reporting on the pairwise comorbidity between mood and anxiety disorders after sorting into comparable study types. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, and the grey literature for publications between 1980 and 2017 regardless of geographical locations and languages. We meta-analyzed estimates from original articles after sorting by: (a) broad or narrow diagnostic criteria, (b) study time-frame, and (c) estimates with or without covariate adjustments. Over 43 000 unique studies were identified through electronic searches, of which 391 were selected for full-text review. Finally, 171 studies were eligible for inclusion, including 53 articles from additional snowball searching. In general, regardless of variations in diagnosis type, study time-frame, temporal order, or use of adjustments, there was substantial comorbidity between mood and anxiety disorders.

In this study, we investigated the cytotoxicity induced by PARP inhibitor olaparib in FLCN deficient RCC cells, and the interaction between FLCN and BRCA1 A complex-regulated DNA repair pathway. METHODS AND MATERIALS FLCN expressing (ACHN and UOK257-F) and FLCN deficient (ACHN-2 and UOK257) cell lines were used in this research. Cell viability was detected by clonogenic assay and MTT assay. Flow cytometry and TUNEL assay were used to detect apoptosis. Autophagy in cells was measured by MDC assay, western blot, and transmission electron microscopy. Co-immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence and western blot experiments were performed to determine the interaction between FLCN protein and BRCA1 A complex. The in vivo experiments were performed in a xenograft model by inoculating UOK 257 in nude mice. RESULTS RCC cells with FLCN protein deficiency were more sensitive to olaparib treatment than the cells with FLCN expression. Olaparib treatment led to more severe autophagy and apoptosis in FLCN deficient ACHN-2 and UOK257 cells compared to the FLCN expressing ACHN and UOK257-F cells. Decreased BRCA1 A complex expression and disruption of DNA repair ability were detected in FLCN-deficient cells, suggesting that FLCN deficiency impaired BRCA1 A complex expression and sensitized cells to PARP inhibitor olaparib. CONCLUSIONS RCC cells deficient in FLCN are sensitive to olaparib treatment due to the impairment of BRCA1 A complex associated DNA repair ability. The results suggest that PARP inhibitor, such as olaparib, may be a potentially effective therapeutic approach for kidney tumors with deficiency of FLCN protein.","Zhang, Qi; Xu, Yingkun; Zhang, Zhiyu; Li, Jianyi; Xia, Qinghua; Chen, Yougen",Gene,122,5

The objective of this review was to evaluate recent literature for the different types of mesh for umbilical and epigastric hernia repair and recurrences after mesh repair. A multi-database search was conducted to reveal relevant studies since 2001 reporting mesh-based repair of primary umbilical/epigastric hernia and their outcomes in adult patients. A total of 20 studies were included, 15 of them solely involved umbilical hernias, whereas the remaining studies included epigastric hernias as well.

In view of the fragmentation of the large amount of information, knowledge gaps in relation to laboratory markers, and scarcity of papers in Portuguese, we propose a Literature review on laboratory changes observed in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS Analysis of articles published between December 2019 and May 2020 on the PubMed and SciELO databases. The articles were identified, filtered, and evaluated based on the approach to the subject, language, and impact. Then, the articles were subjected to a thorough reading, in full, by 4 (four) independent researchers. RESULTS Leukopenia and lymphopenia were included in most studies, even in case definitions. Platelet count and platelet-lymphocyte ratio, at peak platelet, were associated with advanced age and longer hospital stay. Eosinopenia showed a sensitivity of 74.7% and specificity of 68.7% and, together with increased CRP, these are one of the future prospects for screening for disease. A high level of procalcitonin may indicate bacterial co-infection, leading to a worse prognosis.

Regarding the options for a surgical approach to ventral pontine tumors, traditional far-lateral approaches are associated with considerable morbidity due to the required muscle mobilization, brain retraction, and in-line obstruction of cranial nerves before reaching the target. The endoscopic endonasal transclival approach was made appealing by eliminating all of these concerns. The patient's fully pneumatized sphenoid sinus, laterally displaced basilar artery, and the direct ventral location of the bulky disease all further supported this unconventional choice of surgical corridor to achieve a palliative brainstem decompression of an incurable recurrence.","Rajappa, Prajwal; Margetis, Konstantinos; Sigounas, Dimitri; Anand, Vijay; Schwartz, Theodore H; Greenfield, Jeffrey P",Journal of neurosurgery.

In the present study, we aimed to propose a screening marker for materials that can induce fibrotic lung disease using disinfectants, which had been demonstrated as causative materials of chronic inflammation and interstitial fibrosis. We first calculated the corresponding LC50 level based on results from cell viability test and exposed the LC50 level of disinfectants to human bronchial epithelial cells for 24 h. Formation of lamellar body-like structures, cleavage of the nuclear matrix, structural damage of mitochondria were found in the cytosol of the treated cells. We also dosed disinfectants by pharyngeal aspiration to mice to determine the LD0 level. The mice were sacrificed on Day 14 after a single dosing, and lamellar body-like structures were observed in the lung tissue of mice. Herein, we hypothesize that DNA damage and metabolic disturbance may play central roles in disinfectant-induced adverse health effects. Additionally, we propose that formation of lamellar bodies can be a screening marker for interstitial fibrosis.","Park, Eun-Jung; Kang, Min-Sung; Lim, Hyun-Ji; Kang, Tae Kyu; Jin, Seung-Woo; Lee, Seung Hyeun; Baek, Sun Hwa; Kang, Jeong Won",Toxicology and applied pharmacology,122,16

The robotic Xi platform serves as an enabling technology and has resulted in a surge of reports for right-sided ICA, however, there are no reports involving more complex left-sided procedures such as diverticulitis. Furthermore, there are no reports of natural orifice-assisted techniques using robotic Xi in which the specimen can be removed and the anvil can be placed transrectally, thereby completely eliminating the need for an abdominal wall incision other than for port sites. We present a pilot study to investigate the safety, feasibility and short-term outcomes of robotic Natural orifice-assisted IntraCorporeal anastomosis with transrectal Extraction of specimen, called the robotic NICE procedure. Consecutive patients presenting for elective resection for diverticulitis with formation of a colorectal anastomosis were entered into an IRB database. All patients underwent the robotic NICE procedure. Demographic data, intraoperative data and outcomes data were assessed and analyzed. Ten patients (five males and five females) underwent resection. The mean age and BMI were 56 years (43-66) and 29 kg/m2 (21-35). All procedures were successfully completed including transrectal extraction of the specimen and formation of an ICA. The mean operative time was 198 min (146-338) and mean EBL was 35 ml (15-50). Mean time to first flatus was 16 h (10-22) and mean length of stay was 1.9 days (1.6-2.6). There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications. There was no unexpected ICU stay, reoperation or readmission. Colorectal left-sided resections such as for diverticulitis were safely accomplished using natural orifice-assisted extraction of the specimen as well as complete intracorporeal anastomosis in this pilot study. The NICE procedure resulted in early return of bowel function, short length of stay and low complication. The complete elimination of abdominal wall incision likely accounts for these findings and larger cohorts of patients are to be investigated to explore this promising approach afforded by robotic technology.","Minjares, Ramon O; Dimas, Bertha A; Ghabra, Shadin; LeFave, Jean-Paul J; Haas, Eric M",Journal of robotic surgery,122,1

The evolutionary transition from water to land demands various morphological and physiological adaptations of tissues and organs including the sensory and nervous system. In this review, we aim to compare the brain architecture between selected terrestrial and closely related marine representatives of the crustacean taxa Amphipoda, Isopoda, Brachyura, and Anomala with an emphasis on the elements of the olfactory pathway including receptor molecules. Our comparison of neuroanatomical structures between terrestrial members and their close aquatic relatives suggests that during the convergent evolution of terrestrial life-styles, the elements of the olfactory pathway were subject to different morphological transformations. In terrestrial anomalans (Coenobitidae), the elements of the primary olfactory pathway (antennules and olfactory lobes) are in general considerably enlarged whereas they are smaller in terrestrial brachyurans compared to their aquatic relatives. Studies on the repertoire of receptor molecules in Coenobitidae do not point to specific terrestrial adaptations but suggest that perireceptor events - processes in the receptor environment before the stimuli bind - may play an important role for aerial olfaction in this group. In terrestrial members of amphipods (Amphipoda: Talitridae) as well as of isopods (Isopoda: Oniscidea), however, the antennules and olfactory sensilla (aesthetascs) are largely reduced and miniaturized. Consequently, their primary olfactory processing centers are suggested to have been lost during the evolution of a life on land. Nevertheless, in terrestrial Peracarida, the (second) antennae as well as their associated tritocerebral processing structures are presumed to compensate for this loss or rather considerable reduction of the (deutocerebral) primary olfactory pathway. We conclude that after the evolutionary transition from water to land, it is not trivial for arthropods to establish aerial olfaction. If we consider insects as an ingroup of Crustacea, then the Coenobitidae and Insecta may be seen as the most successful crustacean representatives in this respect.","Krieger, Jakob; Hörnig, Marie K; Kenning, Matthes; Hansson, Bill S; Harzsch, Steffen",Arthropod structure & development,122,16

To gain SMR control, stroke survivors are usually instructed to engage in motor imagery (MI) or to attempt moving the paralyzed fingers resulting in task- or event-related desynchronization (ERD) of SMR (SMR-ERD). However, as these tasks are cognitively demanding, especially for stroke survivors suffering from cognitive impairments, BCI control performance can deteriorate considerably over time. Therefore, it would be important to identify biomarkers that predict decline in BCI control performance within an ongoing session in order to optimize the man-machine interaction scheme. APPROACH Here we determine the link between BCI control performance over time and heart rate variability (HRV). Specifically, we investigated whether HRV can be used as a biomarker to predict decline of SMR-ERD control across 17 healthy participants using Granger causality. SMR-ERD was visually displayed on a screen. Participants were instructed to engage in MI-based SMR-ERD control over two consecutive runs of 8.5 minutes each. During the second run, task difficulty was gradually increased. MAIN RESULTS While control performance (p = .18) and HRV (p = .16) remained unchanged across participants during the first run, during the second run, both measures declined over time at high correlation (performance: -0.61%/10s, p = 0; HRV: -0.007ms/10s, p < .001). We found that HRV exhibited predictive characteristics with regard to within-session BCI control performance on an individual participant level (p < .001). SIGNIFICANCE These results suggest that HRV can predict decline in BCI performance paving the way for adaptive BCI control paradigms, e.g., to individualize and optimize assistive BCI systems in stroke.","Nann, Marius; Haslacher, David; Colucci, Annalisa; Eskofier, Bjoern; Von Tscharner, Vinzenz; Soekadar, Surjo",Journal of neural engineering,122,1

METHODS We studied 44 overweight but not obese people with type 2 diabetes who participated in a randomized trial whose primary outcome was the rate of diabetes remission after 2 years of multidisciplinary diabetes care (MDC group) or multidisciplinary care combined with LAGB. Dynamic beta-cell function was assessed by intravenous glucose challenge, and basal beta-cell function (HOMA-B) and insulin sensitivity (HOMA-S) were determined using the homeostatic model. RESULTS Twelve LAGB participants and two MDC participants were in diabetes remission at 2 years. HOMA-S and the C-peptide response to intravenous glucose increased significantly in LAGB but not in MDC participants. The insulin response to glucose did not change in LAGB participants, whereas their fasting C-peptide/insulin ratio increased. Baseline measures of beta-cell function correlated with diabetes remission but not with reduction in HbA1c following LAGB.

The Grx system, comprised of Grx, glutathione, glutathione reductase, and NADPH, was first described as an electron donor for Ribonucleotide Reductase but, from the first discovery in E.coli, the Grx family has impressively grown, particularly in the last two decades. Several isoforms have been described in different organisms (from bacteria to humans) and with different functions. The unique characteristic of Grxs is their ability to catalyse glutathione-dependent redox regulation via glutathionylation, the conjugation of glutathione to a substrate, and its reverse reaction, deglutathionylation. Grxs have also recently been enrolled in iron sulphur cluster formation. These functions have been implied in various physiological and pathological conditions, from immune defense to neurodegeneration and cancer development thus making Grx a possible drug target.

Low-profile braided stents have been introduced recently to facilitate the endovascular treatment of wide-neck aneurysms. We aimed to investigate the feasibility, safety, efficacy, and durability of Y-stent-assisted coiling with double low-profile braided stents for the treatment of complex bifurcation aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective review was performed to identify patients who were treated using Y-stent-assisted coiling with low-profile braided stents. Technical success was assessed, as were initial and follow-up clinical and angiographic outcomes. Periprocedural and delayed complications were reviewed. Preprocedural and follow-up clinical statuses were assessed using the modified Rankin Scale. RESULTS Forty patients with 40 intracranial aneurysms were included in the study. Y-stent placement was successfully performed in all cases. Immediate postprocedural digital subtraction angiography images revealed total aneurysm occlusion in 72.5% of cases. The mean angiographic follow-up time was 24.8 months. The last follow-up angiograms showed complete occlusion in 85% of patients. During follow-up, only 1 patient showed an increase in the filling status of the aneurysm and that patient did not require retreatment. There was no mortality in this study. The overall procedure-related complication rate, including asymptomatic complications, was 17.5%. A permanent morbidity developed in 1 patient (2.5%). CONCLUSIONS The long-term angiographic and clinical outcomes of this retrospective study demonstrate that Y-stent-assisted coiling using low-profile braided stents is an effective, relatively safe, and durable endovascular treatment for wide-neck and complex bifurcation aneurysms.","Aydin, K; Men, S; Barburoglu, M; Sencer, S; Akpek, S",AJNR.

MATERIALS AND METHODS The patient was a 16-year old girl with a body mass index of 55 kg/m(2) and significant comorbidities who underwent LSG and liver biopsy. In the extraction technique, a specimen containing the gastric body and fundus, approximately 80% of the stomach volume, was partitioned longitudinally and intracorporeally with endoshears; subsequently, it was retrieved in one fragment via the lumen of a 15-mm port. RESULTS The procedure time was 65 minutes (specimen extraction time was 7 minutes). Her recovery was uneventful, and she was discharged home on the second postoperative day. At the 1-, 3-, and 6-month follow-up, she has shown all the benefits of weight loss and associated improvement in metabolic parameters and quality of life, without any complications.

The infectious implications of such procedures have been quantified in animal models. This report discusses the infectious risks of transgastric endoscopic peritoneoscopy (TEP) in a human clinical trial. METHODS Under institutional review board approval, 40 patients scheduled for laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) participated in this study. The TEP procedure was performed without preoperative gastric decontamination and without laparoscopic guidance. Preoperative intravenous antibiotics were given. Saline aspirates were taken from the gastric lumen before endoscopic gastrotomy creation and from the peritoneal cavity after transgastric access. Samples were sent for culture, identification, and bacterial counts. Subgroup analysis was performed on patients taking proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). These data were compared with data for ""sterile"" peritoneal aspirates from a historical cohort of 50 patients undergoing LRYGB. RESULTS The median number of bacteria isolated from the gastric aspirates was 980 colony-forming units (CFU)/ml (n=40). The median number of bacteria isolated from the peritoneal aspirates was 323 CFU/ml. Cross-contamination from the stomach to the peritoneal cavity was documented in eight cases. No abscesses or anastomotic leaks were recorded. One port-site infection occurred. Subgroup analysis of 15 patients receiving PPIs showed elevated bacterial counts in gastric aspirates and the post-TEP peritoneal samples compared with patients not receiving PPIs (n=25). This subgroup on PPI's did not have an increase in infectious complications. CONCLUSIONS Contamination of the peritoneal cavity does occur with TEP, but this does not lead to an increased risk of infectious complications. Similarly, patients receiving PPIs have an increased gastric bacterial load and increased contamination after TEP but not an increased risk of infectious complications.","Memark, Vanchad C; Anderson, Joel B; Nau, Peter N; Shah, Nilay; Needleman, Bradley J; Mikami, Dean J; Melvin, William S; Hazey, Jeffrey W",Surgical endoscopy,122,26

While rates of suicide in children and adolescents are reported as lower than those in older populations worldwide, they represent the third leading cause of death in 15-19-year-olds. The rates are higher among boys than girls worldwide, though the death rates for girls exceed those for boys in Bangladesh, China, India, and Nepal. There has been a general decrease in adolescent suicide rates over recent decades. However, increases are reported in South East Asia as well as South America over the same time period. METHODS A narrative review method has been used to summarize current knowledge about risk and protective factors for suicide among children and adolescents and to discuss evidence-based strategy for suicide prevention in this age group. RESULTS Identified suicide risk and protective factors for children and adolescents largely overlap with those for adults. Nevertheless, developmental characteristics may strengthen the impact of some factors, such as decision-making style, coping strategies, family and peer relationships, and victimization. The implementation of evidence-based suicide preventive strategies is needed. Restricting access to lethal means, school-based awareness and skill training programs, and interventions delivered in clinical and community settings have been proven effective. The effectiveness of gatekeeper training and screening programs in reducing suicidal ideation and behavior is unproven but widely examined in selected settings. DISCUSSION Since most studies have been conducted in western countries, future research should assess the effectiveness of these promising strategies in different cultural contexts. The use of more rigorous study designs, the use of both short- and long-term follow-up evaluations, the larger inclusion of individuals belonging to vulnerable groups, the evaluation of online intervention, and the analysis of programs' cost-effectiveness are also required.","Wasserman, Danuta; Carli, Vladimir; Iosue, Miriam; Javed, Afzal; Herrman, Helen",Asia-Pacific psychiatry : official journal of the Pacific Rim College of Psychiatrists,122,17

We conducted this study to test whether more advanced imaging selection, recently developed devices, and earlier intervention improve outcomes. METHODS We randomly assigned patients with ischemic stroke who were receiving 0.9 mg of alteplase per kilogram of body weight less than 4.5 hours after the onset of ischemic stroke either to undergo endovascular thrombectomy with the Solitaire FR (Flow Restoration) stent retriever or to continue receiving alteplase alone. All the patients had occlusion of the internal carotid or middle cerebral artery and evidence of salvageable brain tissue and ischemic core of less than 70 ml on computed tomographic (CT) perfusion imaging. The coprimary outcomes were reperfusion at 24 hours and early neurologic improvement (≥8-point reduction on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale or a score of 0 or 1 at day 3). Secondary outcomes included the functional score on the modified Rankin scale at 90 days. RESULTS The trial was stopped early because of efficacy after 70 patients had undergone randomization (35 patients in each group). The percentage of ischemic territory that had undergone reperfusion at 24 hours was greater in the endovascular-therapy group than in the alteplase-only group (median, 100% vs. 37%; P<0.001). Endovascular therapy, initiated at a median of 210 minutes after the onset of stroke, increased early neurologic improvement at 3 days (80% vs. 37%, P=0.002) and improved the functional outcome at 90 days, with more patients achieving functional independence (score of 0 to 2 on the modified Rankin scale, 71% vs. 40%; P=0.01). There were no significant differences in rates of death or symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS In patients with ischemic stroke with a proximal cerebral arterial occlusion and salvageable tissue on CT perfusion imaging, early thrombectomy with the Solitaire FR stent retriever, as compared with alteplase alone, improved reperfusion, early neurologic recovery, and functional outcome.

In a KG, multiple biomedical datasets can be linked together as a graph representation, with nodes representing entities such as 'chemical substance' or 'genes' and edges representing predicates such as 'causes' or 'treats'. Reasoning and inference algorithms can then be applied to the KG and used to generate new knowledge. We developed three KG-based question-answering systems as part of the Biomedical Data Translator program. These systems are typically tested and evaluated using traditional software engineering tools and approaches. In this study, we explored a team-based approach to test and evaluate the prototype Translator 'Reasoners' through the application of Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) questions. Specifically, we describe three 'hackathons', in which the developers of each of the three systems worked together with a moderator to determine whether the applications could be used to solve MCAT questions. The results demonstrate progressive improvement in system performance, with 0% (0/5) correct answers during the first hackathon, 75% (3/4) correct during the second hackathon, and 100% (5/5) correct during the final hackathon.

Typical complications not only jeopardise the successful outcome of treatment modalities as a whole; they may result in amputation or even become life-threatening. Polihexanide is an antimicrobial substance which is highly appropriate for use in critically colonised or infected acute and chronic wounds. This finding is based primarily on the broad antimicrobial spectrum and good cell and tissue compatibility of polihexanide, its capability of binding to organic matrix, the low risk of contact sensitisation, and the fact that it promotes wound healing. Furthermore, there has been no conclusive evidence to date of any pathogens developing resistances under the use of polihexanide. SUMMARY Wound infections are special and challenging situations in therapy of acute and chronic wounds. Typical complications are risky not only for therapeutic process but also for amputation and viability of patients. Polihexanide is an exceedingly appropriate antimicrobial substance for using in critical colonised and local infected acute and chronic wounds. This evaluation is based on different properties of the compound like the broad antimicrobial spectrum, the excellent cell and tissue tolerability, the binding capacity to organic matrix, low risk of contact sensitisation and adjuvant effects to wound healing. Up to now there are no microbial resistances observed.","Dissemond, J; Gerber, V; Kramer, A; Riepe, G; Strohal, R; Vasel-Biergans, A; Eberlein, T",Journal of tissue viability,122,1

BACKGROUND Critical thinking and creativity are crucial in nursing education. The teaching approach of problem-based learning can help to reduce the difficulties of nurturing problem-solving skills. However, there is little in the literature on how to improve the effectiveness of a problem-based learning lesson by designing appropriate and innovative activities such as composing songs, writing poems and using role plays. DESIGN Exploratory qualitative study. METHODS A sample of 100 students participated in seven semi-structured focus groups, of which two were innovative groups and five were standard groups, adopting three activities in problem-based learning, namely composing songs, writing poems and performing role plays. The data were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS There are three themes extracted from the conversations: 'students' perceptions of problem-based learning', 'students' perceptions of creative thinking' and 'students' perceptions of critical thinking'. Participants generally agreed that critical thinking is more important than creativity in problem-based learning and clinical practice. Participants in the innovative groups perceived a significantly closer relationship between critical thinking and nursing care, and between creativity and nursing care than the standard groups. CONCLUSIONS Both standard and innovative groups agreed that problem-based learning could significantly increase their critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Further, by composing songs, writing poems and using role plays, the innovative groups had significantly increased their awareness of the relationship among critical thinking, creativity and nursing care. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE Nursing educators should include more types of creative activities than it often does in conventional problem-based learning classes. The results could help nurse educators design an appropriate curriculum for preparing professional and ethical nurses for future clinical practice.","Chan, Zenobia C Y",Journal of clinical nursing,122,16

This paper asks whether infection among these public health and safety agencies is a ""canary in the coal mine,"" litmus test, or microcosm (pick your analogy) for the communities in which they operate. Can COVID-19 infection counts and rates be seen ""moving around"" communities by examining the virus's effect on emergency responders themselves? The troubling question of emergency responders becoming ""human indicator values"" is relevant to maintaining the health of Mobile Medicine (EMS and Fire) personnel, as well as Police, who are an under-attended population, because these groups our collective resiliency would crash. It has further implications for policies regarding, and investments in, exposure tracking and contact tracing, PPE acquisition, and mental and physical wellness. Design We aggregated data from four (4) different EMS documentation systems across twelve (12) states using the MEDIVIEW BEACON Prehospital Health Information Exchange. We then outputted lists of charts containing critical ICD-10 values that had been identified by the WHO, the CDC, and the Los Angeles County Fire Deptartment's EMS Bureau as inclusion criteria for possible signs, symptoms, and clinical impressions of COVID-19 infection. Results Three important results emerged from this study: (1) a demonstration of frequent exposure to possible COVID-19 infection among Mobile Medical (EMS & Fire) care providers in the states whose data were included; (2) a demonstration of the nervousness of the general population, given that calls for help due to possible COVID-19 based on symptomology exceeded the number of responses with a correlating ""provider impression"" after an informed clinical assessment; and (3) the fact that this study was empowered by a public-private partnerships between a technology startup and numerous public health and public safety agencies, offers a template for success in rapidly implementing research and development collaborations. Limitations This study incorporates data from only (a) twelve (12) states, and (b) four (4) Mobile Medical documentation systems. We sought to combat these limitations by ensuring that our sample crosses agencies types, geographies, population demographics, and municipal environments (i.e., rural vs. urban). Conclusions Other studies have noted that EMS agencies are tasked with transporting the ""sickest of the sick."" We found that PPE is particularly essential where the frequency of encounters between potentially-or actually-infected patients is high, because from Los Angeles County to rural Texas, without sufficient protection, public health and public safety agencies have become microcosms of the communities they are meant to protect. Indeed, data from the first six months of the declared pandemic in the U.S.A. show that intra-departmental spread is one of (if not the) riskiest sources of infection among Mobile Medical professionals.","Feit, Jonathon S; Witt, Christian C",Online journal of public health informatics,122,1

Young stroke patients with large vessel occlusions may particularly benefit from endovascular intervention. This study aims to assess the authors' experience with the use of modern endovascular techniques to treat young patients (≤ 55 years old) with acute ischemic stroke and large vessel occlusions. METHODS Young patients (≤ 55 years old) undergoing endovascular intervention for acute ischemic stroke at the authors' institution were identified from a prospectively maintained database. Only those patients with a confirmed large vessel occlusion were included. Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores were determined at 90 days during a follow-up visit. A multivariate analysis was performed to determine predictors of outcome (mRS score 0-2). RESULTS A total of 45 patients met the inclusion criteria. The mean age of the patients in this series was 45 ± 9.6 years. The mean admission NIH Stroke Scale score was 14.1 ± 5 (median 13.5). Mechanical thrombectomy was performed using the Solitaire FR device in 13 (29%) patients and the Merci/Penumbra systems in 32 (71%) patients. The rate of successful recanalization (Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction [TIMI] scale Grade II-III) was 93% (42/45). Only 1 patient (2.2%) had a symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage following intervention. One patient (2.2%) sustained a vessel perforation intraoperatively. The rate of 90-day favorable outcome (mRS score 0-2) was 77.5% and the rate of 90-day satisfactory outcome (mRS score 0-3) was 90%. The 90-day mortality rate was 7.5%. In multivariate analysis, postprocedure TIMI grade was the only statistically significant independent predictor of 90-day outcome (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.01-1.19; p = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS The results of this study demonstrate that endovascular therapy provides remarkably high rates of arterial recanalization and favorable outcomes in young patients with acute ischemic stroke and large vessel occlusions. These findings support aggressive interventional strategies in these patients. Randomized, controlled trials reflecting modern acute ischemic stroke treatment will be needed to confirm the findings of this study.","Chalouhi, Nohra; Tjoumakaris, Stavropoula; Starke, Robert M; Hasan, David; Sidhu, Nimrita; Singhal, Saurabh; Hann, Shannon; Gonzalez, L Fernando; Rosenwasser, Robert; Jabbour, Pascal",Neurosurgical focus,122,1

Although published studies support elimination of mesh fixation during endoscopic procedures, the vast majority of surgeons will still recommend it by fear of encountering increased recurrence rates, if omitted. Regrettably, penetrating staple or tack fixation devices are the preferred methods to secure the mesh and cannot be applied at the level of the triangles of 'doom' and 'pain' where hernia tends to reoccur the most. This ongoing prospective cohort study aimed to confirm the safety and advantages of fibrin glue, as a substitute to staple mesh fixation during totally extraperitoneal (TEP) inguinal hernia repair. METHODS Over a 10-year period, 703 patients underwent 1000 elective TEP inguinal hernia repairs. Mesh fixation was achieved using exclusively fibrin sealant. Patients were reviewed at 2, 6 weeks and thereafter on an ad hoc basis if judged necessary until complete resolution of their symptoms. Quality of life (QoL) was assessed in a subgroup of 320 patients using the Carolina Comfort Scale (CCS). RESULTS No conversion to open surgery was observed. There were three cases of major morbidities and no mortality. Three months after surgery, only seven patients (1 %) experienced chronic groin or testicular discomfort and none of them required prescription painkillers. When using the CCS, at 2 weeks 93.1 % of the patients were either satisfied or very satisfied with their outcome. This satisfaction index increased up to 99.2 % at 6 weeks post surgery. Finally, only eight hernia recurrences (1.1 %) were reported, of which five occurred during the first month of the study. CONCLUSION Fibrin glue mesh fixation of inguinal hernia during TEP repair is extremely safe and reliable, with a very high satisfaction index for the patients and limited risk of developing chronic pain.","Berney, Christophe R; Descallar, Joseph",Surgical endoscopy,122,16

The aim of this trial was to estimate the impact of nasal high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) therapy on respiratory stability during sedation for upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy in children. METHODS Prospective randomized controlled non-blinded single-center pilot trial. Children were randomly allocated to receive either HFNC (2 L/kg/min) or low-flow nasal oxygen cannula (LFNC, standard care). FiO2 was titrated to maintain SpO2 94%-98% in both groups. Primary outcome was the number of events of respiratory instability defined by prespecified criteria (hypoxia, hypercapnia, apnea). Secondary outcomes included type and duration of events, number of interventions to regain respiratory stability and cumulative doses of medication. RESULTS Fifty children (mean age 12.3±3.1 years) were enrolled and treated with HFNC (n=25) or LFNC (n=25). Patient and intervention characteristics were not different in the two study groups, including total oxygen flow rate. Mean (SD) number of respiratory events in the HFNC group was 2.0±1.9 events compared to 2.0±1.4 events in the LFNC group (P = 0.65, 95% CI of difference -1.0 - 1.0). There was no difference for any secondary outcome criteria, percentage of patients for any outcome criteria and no difference in the number of respiratory events or airway management maneuvers per patient between treatment groups.

Large differences are reported in literature on wound complication rates. Aim was to perform a systematic review on reported postoperative wound complication (POWC) and postoperative wound infection (POWI) rates following the ELA and evaluate and quantify geographical differences. METHODS A literature search was conducted in the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases and Cochrane Library. Studies before 2000, with <10 patients, biomechanical studies and reviews were excluded. No restrictions regarding language were applied. RESULTS 3068 articles were identified of which 123 were included, with 8584 calcaneal fractures in 28 different countries. The average total number of POWC was 14.3%, with 3.8% of superficial and 2.2% of deep infections. The highest POWI rate was found in Europe (12.1%) and the lowest in North America (2.8%). A significant difference in incidence of deep POWI between continents was detected (median 0-3.8%). No differences were found in incidence of POWC and POWI between retro- and prospective studies (respectively p=0.970, p=0.748) or studies with <10 or ≥10 operations per year (respectively p=0.326, p=0.378). However, lower rates of POWI were found in studies with a follow up of >3months (p=0.01). CONCLUSION Large differences were detected in incidence of POWC and POWI following calcaneal fracture surgery with the ELA between countries and continents. We did not find a lower POWC or POWI rate in retrospective studies compared to prospective studies, larger studies or in studies in which more patients were treated annually. However, the rate of POWI was significantly lower in studies with a follow up of >3months. We advise the use of a reliable postoperative complication registration system and uniformity in the use of standardized definitions of wound complications for calcaneal fracture surgery.","Backes, M; Spierings, K E; Dingemans, S A; Goslings, J C; Buckley, R E; Schepers, T",Injury,122,31

We investigated whether early HNSCC can be detected by applying gGlu-HMRG to clinical samples. METHODS gGlu-HMRG was applied to four HNSCC cell lines, and fluorescence was observed by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Immunohistological examination was performed in three recent cases of endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) to investigate GGT expression. Fluorescence imaging with gGlu-HMRG in eight clinical samples resected by ESD or surgery was performed, and fluorescence intensity of tumor and normal mucosa regions of interest (ROI) was prospectively measured. RESULTS All four gGlu-HMRG-applied cell lines emitted green fluorescence. Immunohistological examination demonstrated that GGT was highly expressed in HNSCC of the recent three ESD cases but barely in the normal mucosa. Fluorescence imaging showed that iodine-voiding lesions became fluorescent within a few minutes after application of gGlu-HMRG in all eight resected tumors. Tumor ROI fluorescence intensity was significantly higher than in the normal mucosa five minutes after gGlu-HMRG application. CONCLUSIONS Fluorescence imaging with gGlu-HMRG would be useful for early detection of HNSCC.","Mizushima, Takeshi; Ohnishi, Shunsuke; Shimizu, Yuichi; Hatanaka, Yutaka; Hatanaka, Kanako C; Hosono, Hidetaka; Kubota, Yoshimasa; Natsuizaka, Mitsuteru; Kamiya, Mako; Ono, Shouko; Homma, Akihiro; Kato, Mototsugu; Sakamoto, Naoya; Urano, Yasuteru",BMC cancer,122,1

Using a stapling device, a gastric tube can safely be created in a short amount of time. The problems with gastric tube creation using only linear type staplers include staple overlap as well as the problem of cost associated with using multiple staplers. To address this, both linear and radial type staplers have been introduced. We herein compare three methods of gastric tube creation. METHODS From 2012 to 2014, 62 patients with esophageal cancer underwent esophagectomy with gastric tube reconstruction. We evaluated and compared the mean number of stapler loads and cost in each groups. RESULTS The mean number of stapler loads was 6.24 in method A, 5.16 in method B, and 4.33 in method C. The mean cost accounting for total staple fires per case was 3116.07 dollars in the method A group, 2576.74 dollars in the method B group, and 2447.78 dollars in the method C group. Anastomotic leaks developed in 4 cases in the method A group and in 3 cases in the method B group. There were no anastomotic leaks in the method C group. CONCLUSION We hypothesize that by using radial type staplers, we can create a durable gastric tube and reduce the number of staplers and therefore reduce operative cost.","Kimura, Masahiro; Mitsui, Akira; Kuwabara, Yoshiyuki",Annals of medicine and surgery,122,1

The widely anticipated negative impact these interventions would have on families, including on their mental health, were not included in decision models. The purpose of this editorial is, therefore, to stimulate debate by considering some of the barriers that have stopped governments setting the benefits of lockdown against, in particular, mental health costs during this process and so to make possible a more balanced approach going forward. First, evidence that lockdown causes mental health problems needs to be stronger. Natural experimental studies will play an essential role in providing such evidence. Second, innovative health economic approaches that allow the costs and benefits of lockdown to be compared directly are required. Third, we need to develop public health information strategies that allow more nuanced and complex messages that balance lockdown's costs and benefits to be communicated. These steps should be accompanied by a major public consultation/engagement campaign aimed at strengthening the publics' understanding of science and exploring beliefs about how to strike the appropriate balance between costs and benefits in public health intervention decisions.","Sonuga-Barke, Edmund J S","Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines",122,19

Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) can noninvasively measure tissue oxygenation. We hypothesized that NIRS would correlate well with CBF, with cerebral metabolism of oxygen (CMRO2) and glucose and with lactate production as CPP was reduced. Seven anesthetized piglets were subjected to reductions in CPP to 60, 50, 40, 30, and 20 mmHg by infusing an artificial cerebral spinal fluid into the lateral ventricle of the brain. After a period of equilibration, NIRS over the left temporal cortex and regional CBF (microspheres) were measured at each CPP level as well as arterial and internal jugular PaO2 , glucose, and lactate. CMRO2 and glucose consumption and lactate production were calculated by standard formulae. NIRS correlated very well (P < 0.05) with CBF in the left temporal cortex [mean r (95% CI) = 0.95 (0.91-0.99)] and with left hemispheric CMRO2 [0.94 (0.90-0.98)], glucose consumption [0.87 (0.76-0.97)], and lactate production [0.89 (0.81-0.97)]. The correlation of NIRS with CBF was slightly better (P < 0.05) than that of CPP with CBF [0.89 (0.84-0.94)]. In this model of global cerebral hypertension, NIRS correlated well with CBF and measures of cerebral metabolism, and might be useful as a surrogate for CPP. Further studies are warranted to determine if NIRS is associated with these variables in focal cerebral injury.","Alosh, Humam; Ramirez, Alma; Mink, Richard",Journal of applied physiology,122,28

However, significant differences can be observed between oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry (SpO2 ) and arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2 ) in some clinical conditions. We aimed to assess the reliability of pulse oximeter in patients with COVID-19 METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed ABG analyses and SpO2 levels measured simultaneously with ABG in patients hospitalized in COVID-19 wards. RESULTS We categorized total 117 patients into two groups; in whom the difference between SpO2 and SaO2 was ≤4% (acceptable difference) and >4% (large difference). Large difference group exhibited higher neutrophil count, C-reactive protein, ferritin, fibrinogen, D-dimer and lower lymphocyte count. Multivariate analyses revealed that increased fibrinogen, increased ferritin and decreased lymphocyte count were independent risk factors for large difference between SpO2 and SaO2 . The total study group demonstrated the negative bias of 4.02% with the limits of agreement of -9.22% to 1.17%. The bias became significantly higher in patients with higher ferritin, fibrinogen levels and lower lymphocyte count. CONCLUSION Pulse oximeters may not be sufficient to assess actual oxygen saturation especially in COVID-19 patients with high ferritin and fibrinogen levels and low lymphocyte count low SpO2 measurements.","Gürün Kaya, Aslıhan; Öz, Miraç; Akdemir Kalkan, İrem; Gülten, Ezgi; Çınar, Güle; Azap, Alpay; Kaya, Akın",International journal of clinical practice,122,4

This review systematically examined the literature to identify which anxiety measures were most commonly used with older adults in RACFs, and determine whether psychometric data support their use within this population. METHODS Using the PRISMA guidelines, five electronic databases were searched using key terms and subject headings. The search was limited to literature published in English. Eligible studies utilized an anxiety measure to assess anxiety symptoms among RACF residents. Based on the findings of this search, a critical review of the research into the reliability, validity, and administrative and respondent burden of the most commonly used measures (i.e. used in four or more studies) was conducted. RESULTS In total, 1,771 articles were identified, with 50 studies included in this review. Overall, 22 measures were used, with the majority of studies utilizing a clinician-administered or self-report measure. The RAID, HADS, STAI, and GAI were the most commonly used measures. While overall there is a lack of research and consensus into the psychometric properties of these measures within RACFs, strongest evidence of reliability and validity was found for the GAI. CONCLUSION Commonly used measures of anxiety within aged care populations are not well validated for this complex subsample of older adults.

We agree that medical care in the COVID era has radically changed; using new mechanisms in the care of different diseases is undoubtedly now a priority to avoid contagion of both the patient and the medical staff, although the vaccine could protect the population, there are still many questions to answer; The model we use for the care of patients with a diagnosis of HCV in Mexico showed great benefits, as in other studies, since it significantly reduced costs, almost 50% of the patients were far from the center the third level but could be included, treated, monitored and cured using this model, with savings also in the complications that were avoided due to the non-progression of the disease and/or the stabilization of the already established liver disease, always based on guidelines international and national. This model could be used for other pathologies that require an evaluation and follow-up by specialists and subspecialists in populations far from tertiary hospitals. Even first contact doctors can be consulted, surely with extraordinary benefits in the final result of patient care, but especially now in the COVID era that requires greater protection for patients and health workers. We also agree with Dr. Javier Crespo's group that scientific societies and the governments of the countries are even more interested in supporting this type of care and generating the legal bases for this purpose.","Perez Hernandez, Jose Luis; Higuera de la Tijera, Maria de Fatima; Arce Salinas, Cesar Alejandro",Revista espanola de enfermedades digestivas : organo oficial de la Sociedad Espanola de Patologia Digestiva,122,25

The cause of such downflows, however, is still not fully clear and has remained a matter of debate. We aim to understand the cause of such downflows by studying the coronal and TR responses to the recently reported chromospheric downflowing rapid red shifted excursions (RREs), and their impact on heating the solar atmosphere. We have used two sets of coordinated data from SST, IRIS, and SDO for analyzing the response of the downflowing RREs in the TR and corona. To provide theoretical support, we use an already existing 2.5D MHD simulation of spicules performed with the Bifrost code. We find ample occurrences of downflowing RREs and show several examples of their spatio-temporal evolution, sampling multiple wavelength channels ranging from the cooler chromospheric to hotter coronal channels. These downflowing features are thought to be likely associated with the returning components of the previously heated spicular plasma. Furthermore, the TR Doppler shifts associated with them are close to the average red shifts observed in this region which further implies that these flows could (partly) be responsible for the persistent downflows observed in the TR. We also propose two mechanisms (a typical upflow followed by a downflow and downflows along a loop), from the perspective of numerical simulation, that could explain the ubiquitous occurrence of such downflows. A detailed comparison between the synthetic and observed spectral characteristics, reveals a distinctive match, and further suggests an impact on the heating of the solar atmosphere. We present evidence that suggests that at least some of the downflowing RREs are the chromospheric counterparts of the TR and lower coronal downflows.","Bose, Souvik; Voort, Luc Rouppe van der; Joshi, Jayant; Henriques, Vasco M.J.; N'obrega-Siverio, Daniel; Mart'inez-Sykora, Juan; Pontieu, Bart De",,122,10

Specifically, we will conduct a systematic search of published studies to map the state of the literature on feasibility, intervention procedures, and efficacy of dance to improve health-related outcomes for individuals post-stroke. Stroke is the leading cause of long-term disability frequently causing motor and cognitive impairments that impact functional abilities. Dance inherently encompasses key principles of motor learning including cognitive-motor specific task practice, sensory feedback, and social engagement. Dance and music create an enriched environment, engaging emotion and promoting positive affect. Electronic databases were searched in February 2021. Original, peer-reviewed studies will be included if they broadly describe the use of a dance intervention for individuals post-stroke. Studies including other neurological populations will be considered only if stroke results can be isolated. We will categorize studies based on dance style, study type, population characteristics, and study setting. We will narratively synthesize results, assessing feasibility, intervention procedures, and efficacy of dance to improve health-related outcomes in stroke survivors, including potential motor, cognitive, psychological, and social benefits. This scoping review will be the first to broadly describe the existing literature on dance interventions for individuals post-stroke.

DESIGN: Nationwide population-based retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Korean national health insurance claims database between January 1, 2020, and May 30, 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with positive COVID-19 test and 12 folded controls matched by age, sex and region. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Outcomes were confirmation of the comorbidities affecting the infection rate and the severity of COVID-19. Patients and outcomes were propensity score matching of factors which may affect COVID-19 infection rate and severity was performed. COVID-19 infections were confirmed through laboratory testing. Severe infection was defined as those who underwent tracheostomy, continuous renal replacement therapy, intensive care unit admission, ventilator use, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or died. RESULTS: A total of 8070 individuals with positive covid-19 test and 12015 controls were identified. In people aged 60 or older, in those insured with Medicaid, and in the disabled, the proportion corresponding to the severe group of patients showed a tendency to increase. The infection rate of COVID-19 was highest in pulmonary disease (adjusted odds ratio 1.88, 95% confidence interval 1.70 to 2.03), and hyperlipidemia (0.73, 0.67 to 0.80) had a lower infection rate. Disease severity was highest in kidney disease (5.59, 2.48 to 12.63), and lower in hyperlipidemia (0.78, 0.60 to 1.00). CONCLUSIONS: There is less bias as the government pays for all tests and treatments related to COVID-19 included in the data used in this study. Using propensity matching to reduce statistical bias, we found that most comorbidities increased the infection rate and severity of COVID-19, whereas hyperlipidemia reduced the rate and severity of infection. These results can be utilized to effectively manage COVID-19 infections.","Kim, J.; Park, S. H.; Kim, J. M.",,122,16

It is one of the most common symptoms of upper respiratory diseases including COVID-19 and is a leading cause of physician visits and antibiotic prescriptions. However, few over the counter medications are proven to heal sore throat inflammation. Methods Adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial cells (A549 cells) and three dimensional organotypic human respiratory tissues were used to study inflammation and various treatment effects on respiratory epithelia. The cells and tissues were studied both in the presence and absence of bradykinin, one of the first inflammatory mediators of pharyngitis. Inflammation was measured by analyzing levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), interleukin 8 (IL-8), and leukotriene B4 (LTB4), transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. Tissue morphology was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Results In studying pharyngitis using organotypic human respiratory tissue stimulated with bradykinin, we saw an increase in prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) in response to bradykinin. Acetyl salicylic acid (ASA), a non-specific COX inhibitor, was able to mitigate a bradykinin-induced increase in PGE2 in our studies. However, ASA was inflammatory above its therapeutic window, increasing levels of PGE2 and IL-8 above those seen with bradykinin stimulation alone. We describe a novel, scientifically validated treatment for sore throat, that contains a low dose of aspirin and other anti-inflammatory ingredients. Conclusion This study elucidates the complex mechanisms involved in healing pharyngitis, an inflammatory condition of the upper respiratory epithelia. An ASA-based formula (Biovanta) mitigated bradykinin-induced inflammation more strongly than ASA alone in organotypic human respiratory tissues. Surprisingly, we found that many of the most common over the counter sore throat therapies exacerbate inflammation and IL-8 in organotypic human respiratory tissues, suggesting these common treatments may increase the likelihood of further respiratory complications. Competing interest statement This study was funded entirely by Applied Biological Laboratories, a private company that owns the Biovanta™ product.

Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of adult and pediatric patients with the diagnosis of IIM. SIGLEC1 expression was assessed by flow cytometry and was compared with Physician Global Assessment (PGA) or Childhood Myositis Assessment Scale (CMAS) disease activity scores. Mann Whitney-U test and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used for cross-sectional data analysis (n=96), two-level mixed-effects linear regression model for longitudinal analyses (n=26, 110 visits). Response to treatment was analyzed in 14 patients within 12 months, using Wilcoxon test. SIGLEC1 was compared to ISG15/MxA status by immunohistochemical staining of muscle biopsies (n=17). Results: 96 patients with adult (a) and juvenile (j) dermatomyositis (DM, n=38), antisynthetase syndrome (AS, n=19), immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM, n=8), inclusion body myositis (IBM, n=9), and overlap myositis (n=22) were included. SIGLEC1 distinguished significantly between active and inactive disease with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.83-1) in DM and correlated with disease activity longitudinally (aDM: standardized beta=0.54, p<0.001; jDM: standardized beta=-0.70, p<0.001). Response to treatment in DM was associated with a decreasing SIGLEC1 (p<0.01, Wilcoxon test). A positive ISG15/MxA stain was highly associated with a SIGLEC1 upregulation. SIGLEC1 was found upregulated in AS (42.1%) and IBM (22,2%) and not in IMNM. Conclusion: SIGLEC1 is a candidate biomarker to assess type I interferon activity in IIM and proved useful for monitoring disease activity and response to treatment in juvenile and adult DM.","Graf, M.; von Stuckrad, S.

However, limited genomic sampling in many high-incidence countries has impeded detailed studies of SARS-CoV-2 genomic epidemiology. Consequently, critical questions remain about the generation and global distribution of virus genetic diversity. To address this gap, we investigated SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics in Gujarat, India, during its first epidemic wave and shed light on virus' spread in one of the pandemic's hardest-hit regions. By integrating regional case data and 434 whole virus genome sequences sampled across 20 districts from March to July 2020, we reconstructed the epidemic dynamics and spatial spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Gujarat, India. Our findings revealed that global and regional connectivity, along with population density, were significant drivers of the Gujarat SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. The three most populous districts in Gujarat accounted ~84% of total cases during the first wave. Moreover, we detected over 100 virus lineage introductions, which were primarily associated with international travel. Within Gujarat, virus dissemination occurred predominantly from densely populated regions to geographically proximate locations with low-population density. Our findings suggest SARS-CoV-2 transmission follows a gravity model in India, with urban centres contributing disproportionately to onward virus spread.","Raghwani, J.; du Plessis, L.; McCrone, J.

We hypothesized that extended use (up to 13 months) of the adaptive algorithm with integrated directionality and noise reduction, OpenSound Navigator (OSN), would result in improved performance compared to the control algorithm, omnidirectional (Omni), on auditory, cognitive and academic tasks. Design: We recruited 42 children, aged 6 - 13 years old, through Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center's Division of Audiology. Two children withdrew from the study due to noncompliance or discomfort. The remaining 40 children were paired by age (within one year) and hearing loss (level and configuration). The individuals from each pair were randomly assigned to a group: OSN (experimental) and Omni (control). Each child completed an audiology evaluation, hearing aid fitting, a follow up audiological appointment and two research visits up to 13 months apart. Research visit outcome measures covered speech perception (in quiet and in noise), novel grammar and word learning, cognition, academic ability and caregiver report of listening behaviours. Results: The children with the experimental algorithm did not show improved performance on the outcome measures compared to the control algorithm. There was a significant relationship between age at first hearing aid use and Reading and Mathematical ability across all participants.

The thermodynamic outcomes indicate that all the formulations show an excellent physical stability. The average colloidal carrier size was within nano size diameter. The polydispersity index (PDI) was from (0.011 to 0.03). The absolute values of zeta potential was (31.1mV to 33.4mV). The viscosity data of nanocarrier systems indicate non-Newtonian pseudoplastic rheological properties of prepared F1-F6. The selected colloidal dispersion was F6 due to contain a greater loading quantity of myrtle and peppermint EOs. This research aims to prepare a lipid-polymer hybrid nanocarrier system to be given by nebulization through the pulmonary route to achieve the rapid therapeutic efficacy of myrtle and peppermint EOs using a novel microwave method.","Drais, H.

Completing this picture by identifying unknown hosts of known viruses is an important research aim that can help identify zoonotic and animal-disease risks. Furthermore, such understanding can be used to mitigate against viral spill-over from animal reservoirs into human population. To address this knowledge-gap we apply a divide-and-conquer approach which separates viral, mammalian and network features into three unique perspectives, each predicting associations independently to enhance predictive power. Our approach predicts over 20,000 unknown associations between known viruses and mammalian hosts, suggesting that current knowledge underestimates the number of associations in wild and semi-domesticated mammals by a factor of 4.3, and the average mammalian host-range of viruses by a factor of 3.2. In particular, our results highlight a significant knowledge gap in the wild reservoirs of important zoonotic and domesticated mammals’ viruses: specifically, lyssaviruses, bornaviruses and rotaviruses.","Wardeh, Maya; Blagrove, Marcus S.C.; Sharkey, Kieran J.; Baylis, Matthew",bioRxiv,122,16

This systematic reviews objective was to consolidate understanding of RVFV epidemiology during 1999-2021 and highlight knowledge gaps relevant to plans for human vaccine trials. Methodology/Principal Findings: The review is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020221622). Reports of RVFV infection or exposure among humans, animals, and/or vectors in Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and the Indian Ocean during the period January 1999 to June 2021 were eligible for inclusion. Online databases were searched for publications, and supplemental materials were recovered from official reports and research colleagues. Exposures were classified into five groups: 1) acute human RVF cases, 2) acute animal cases, 3) human RVFV sero-surveys, 4) animal sero-surveys, and 5) insect infections. Human risk factors, circulating RVFV lineages, and surveillance methods were also tabulated. In meta-analysis of risks, summary odds ratios were computed using random-effects modeling. 1104 unique human or animal RVFV transmission events were reported in 39 countries during 1999-2021. Outbreaks among humans or animals occurred at rates of 5.8/year and 12.4/year, respectively, with Mauritania, Madagascar, Kenya, South Africa, and Sudan having the most human outbreak years. Men had greater odds of RVFV infection than women, and animal contact, butchering, milking, and handling aborted material were significantly associated with greater odds of exposure. Animal risk was linked to location, proximity to water, and exposure to other herds or wildlife. RVFV was detected in a variety of mosquito vectors during interepidemic periods, confirming ongoing transmission. Conclusions/Significance: With broad variability in surveillance, case finding, survey design, and RVFV case confirmation, combined with uncertainty about populations-at-risk, there were inconsistent results from location to location. However, it was evident that RVFV transmission is expanding its range and frequency. Gaps assessment indicated the need to harmonize human and animal surveillance and improve diagnostics and genotyping. Given the frequency of RVFV outbreaks, human vaccination has strong potential to mitigate the impact of this now widely endemic disease.","Gerken, K. N.; LaBeaud, A.

This yields diagrams which are well suited for viewing dynamic simulations, such as those used for interactive molecular dynamics. We illustrate the utility of this algorithm by using it to visualize iMD-VR (interactive molecular dynamics in virtual reality) simulations of the secondary structure of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), which is being investigated as a potential target for COVID drug therapies.","Jamieson-Binnie, A.

Coronavirus disease is also termed COVID-19. It affects the human respiratory system and thus can be traced and tracked from the Chest X-Ray images. Therefore, Chest X-Ray alone may play a vital role in identifying COVID-19 cases. In this paper, we propose a Machine Learning (ML) approach that utilizes the X-Ray images to classify the healthy and affected patients based on the patterns found in these images. The article also explores traditional, and Deep Learning (DL) approaches for COVID-19 patterns from Chest X-Ray images to predict, analyze, and further understand this virus. The experimental evaluation of the proposed approach achieves 97.5% detection performance using the DL model for COVID-19 versus normal cases. In contrast, for COVID-19 versus Pneumonia Virus scenario, we achieve 94.5% accurate detections. Our extensive evaluation in the experimental section guides and helps in the selection of an appropriate model for similar tasks. Thus, the approach can be used for medical usages and is particularly pertinent in detecting COVID-19 positive patients using X-Ray images alone.","Khan, R.

We performed genome-wide screens in human cells with chloroquine and several other widely used cationic amphipathic drugs (CADs) including the anti-depressants, sertraline (Zoloft) and fluoxetine (Prozac), the analgesic nortriptyline (Pamelor), the anti-arrhythmic amiodarone (Cordarone), and the anti-hypertensive verapamil (Calan) to characterize their molecular similarities and differences. Despite CADs having different disease indications but consistent with them sharing key chemical properties, we found CADs to have remarkably similar phenotypic profiles compared with non-CADs we and others have previously screened (1–5). The most significant genetic interaction for all CADs was the initiating step in sphingolipid biosynthesis catalyzed by serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT). A comparison of genome-wide screens performed with diverse pathogens from viruses, bacteria, plants, and parasites including Ebola (6), adeno-associated virus AAV2 (7), HIV (8), Rotavirus (9), Influenza A (10), Zika virus (11), Picornavirus (12), Exotoxin A (13), Cholera toxin (14), Type III secretion system and Shiga toxin (15, 16), Ricin toxin (17), and Toxoplasma gondii (18) showed SPT as a top common host factor and 80% overlap overall in top hits specifically with CADs. Potential sphingolipid-mediated mechanisms for the host response- and virulence-modulating effects of CADs involve autophagy and SERPINE1/PAI-1 (plasminogen activator inhibitor-1).

Particularly in view of the current COVID-19 pandemic, maintaining strength outside the normal framework provides an advantage to athletes for the next competitions. OBJECTIVE: To compare the CrossFit Barbara which can be applied easily at home during the off-season or some situations such as the epidemic limitation to classic resistance training methods used to maintain the strength performance of national kickboxers. METHODS: Forty-three national kickboxers, CrossFit (CF, n= 22), and resistance training (RT, n= 21), participated in this study. While CF performed 20 pull-ups, 30 push-ups, 40 sit-ups, and 50 squat exercises, RT performed bench press, lat pull down, leg press, biceps curl, and triceps extension exercises twice per week for six weeks. Before and after the six weeks, the following variables were measured;body mass (BM) and body fat percentage (FP), VO2max, bench press (BP), squat (SQ), leg strength (LS), hand grip strength (HGS), pull-up, push-up and counter movement jump (CMJ).

This research investigates whether a single-session online writing intervention results in changes in romantic conflict among American adults cohabitating during COVID-19 quarantine (May 2020). Participants (N = 716, 50% female;mean age = 51.8 years) completed a baseline assessment which was followed by a brief (5–8 min) writing task in Qualtrics. Participants were randomized to one of five conditions, where they were asked to write about (a) a conflict with their romantic partner using cognitive reappraisal;(b) a conflict with their romantic partner expressing their deepest thoughts and feelings;(c) a conflict with someone other than their partner using cognitive reappraisal;(d) a conflict with someone other than their partner and a conflict with their partner expressing their deepest thoughts and feelings;or (e) mundane tasks like laundry, house cleaning, or lawn care. In the reappraisal conditions, participants were asked to use this perspective with the target person in the upcoming weeks. Two weeks later, participants were invited to complete a follow-up survey identical to baseline, where they were asked about conflict with their partner during the follow-up period. Results indicated that participants in the romantic partner cognitive reappraisal condition reported fewer disagreements, fewer relationship aggression events, and lower levels of conflict relentlessness with their partner relative to at least one of the control conditions. Results demonstrate preliminary support for a brief, cost-effective, and accessible tool that can help couples mitigate downstream effects of negative interactions during this stressful time.

In this turbulent environment, the purpose of this study is twofold. First, this paper explores the direct effect of consumers' internal/external health locus-of-control on their hygiene consciousness, which, in turn, affects their social distancing behavior. Second, this study posits that social distancing, in turn, impacts consumers' current online grocery shopping behavior and their future online grocery shopping intentions, thus uncovering important insight. Design/methodology/approach To address these gaps, this paper develops a model that links consumers' internal/external health locus-of-control to their adoption of e-tailing-based grocery services. Data collected through a web-based survey was analyzed by using partial least squares-based structural equation modeling. Findings The results indicate that consumers' health locus-of-control indirectly affects the way they shop for their groceries during the pandemic. In particular, consumers' internal (external) health locus-of-control drives higher (lower) hygiene consciousness and greater (lower) social distancing behavior. In turn, consumers' online grocery shopping behavior was found to increase during the pandemic, with their corresponding intent to continue this behavior in the future. Moreover, this study finds the effects of consumers' social distancing on their current grocery shopping behavior and future intentions to be contingent on consumer age, with stronger effects identified for older consumers. Originality/value This study shows how consumers' internal/external health loci-of-control exert opposing effects on their social distancing behavior, as mediated by hygiene consciousness. Overall, the empirical analyzes corroborate the association of consumers' social distancing- and online grocery shopping behavior (for consumers of different age profiles), both during and after the pandemic.","Itani, O.

Our proposed model is capable of coping with the key challenge of colon apparent heterogeneity caused by several types of diseases. Our model is driven by attention-based deep multiple instance learning and is trained end-to-end on weakly labeled data using video labels instead of detailed frame-by-frame annotation. The spatial and temporal features are obtained through ResNet50 and residual Long short-term memory (residual LSTM) blocks, respectively. Additionally, the learned temporal attention module provides the importance of each frame to the final label prediction. Moreover, we developed a self-supervision method to maximize the distance between classes of pathologies. We demonstrate through qualitative and quantitative experiments that our proposed weakly supervised learning model gives superior precision and F1-score reaching, 61.6% and 55.1%, as compared to three state-of-the-art video analysis methods respectively. We also show our model's ability to temporally localize frames with pathologies, without frame annotation information during training.

In this sense, in this article, we focus implementing an IoT-based System for safer mobility in the age of COVID-19 using machine learning called SafeMobility. This system has been designed to monitor in real-time the social distancing between people and control the capacity in common interior spaces via a multilayer architecture that integrates IoT, fog, and cloud solutions. To control the capacity safely, we have detected the location of people using machine learning models. We have trained and evaluated these models from a data set containing the RSSI signals of the different surrounding WiFi networks obtained via a portable IoT device. Besides, this portable device integrated with a high precision laser sensor has also been used to detect the distance between people, thus avoiding potential infections. Also, we have exploited the advantages of fog computing to perform data processing and analysis in a fog node using the machine learning model that presented the highest accuracy in the evaluation. In case of non-compliance with the allowed social distance or the established peak capacity, alert messages are sent via a lightweight and optimal protocol in using IoT applications.

We have recently developed a lipoproteoplex (LPP) consisting of a super-charged coiled-coil protein (CSP) and a cationic liposomal carrier, that has the ability to condense nucleic acids and deliver them in vivo. The LPP is distinct from other liposomal gene delivery systems in that it utilizes a modular protein component to drive transfection activity as opposed to relying on the passive effects of the cationic lipids. A CSP library has been rationally designed to improve the efficacy of the LPP compared to the parent protein via improved alpha-helical structure and increased nucleic acid binding through the use of extended histidine tags and increased positive charge. The secondary structure and nucleic acid binding ability of each library member was assessed, then compared to functional transfection data in NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblasts. Structural and functional data suggests that increasing alpha-helicity of the protein component of the LPP compared to the parent sequence doubles nucleic acid binding affinity and increases transfection activity almost 3-fold with a favorable safety profile.","Thomas, Joseph; Monkovic, Julia; Frezzo, Joseph A.; Katyal, Priya; Punia, Kamia; Montclare, Jin K.",bioRxiv,122,1

This study is a prospective collection and review of all cases with a myocarditis/pericarditis diagnosis over a 2-month period at an academic medical center. Methods: Prospective case series from 1st June 2021 until 31st July 2021. Patients were identified by admission and discharge diagnoses which included myocarditis or pericarditis. Inclusion criteria were: in receipt of mRNA vaccine within one month prior to presentation; The CMR protocol included cine imaging, native T1 and T2 mapping, late gadolinium enhancement and post contrast T1 mapping. All CMR studies were read in consensus by two experienced readers. Diagnosis was based on clinical presentation, ECG/echo findings and serial troponins and was confirmed in each case by CMR. Incidence was estimated from total doses of mRNA vaccine administered in the Ottawa region for the matching time-period. This data was obtained from the Public Health Agency of Ottawa. Results: 32 patients were identified over the period of interest. Eighteen patients were diagnosed with myocarditis; 12 with myopericarditis; and 2 with pericarditis alone. The median age was 33 years (18-65 years). The sex ratio was 2 females to 29 male. In 5 cases, symptoms developed after only a single dose of mRNA vaccine. In 27 patients, symptoms developed after their second dose of. Median time between vaccine dose and symptoms was 1.5 days (1-26 days). Chest pain was the commonest symptom, but many others were reported. Non-syncopal non-sustained ventricular tachycardia was seen in only a single case. Median LV ejection fraction (EF) was 57% (44-66%). Nine patients had an LVEF below the normal threshold of 55%. Incidence of myopericarditis overall was approximately 10 cases for every 10,000 innoculations. Summary and Conclusions: This is the largest series in the literature to clearly relate the temporal relationship between mRNA COVID vaccination, symptoms and CMR findings. In most patients, symptom onset began within the first few days after vaccination with corresponding abnormalities in biomarkers and on ECG. Cardiac MRI confirmed acute myocardial and pericardial changes with the presence of edema demonstrated with both tissue mapping and late gadolinium enhancement. Symptoms settled quickly with standard therapy and patients were discharged within a few days. No major adverse cardiac events and no significant arrhythmias were noted during inpatient stay. Further follow up will be required to ascertain the longer-term outcomes of this patient group.","Kafil, T.; Lamacie, M.

Ghrelin has been proposed as a treatment for cancer cachexia partly by preventing AT atrophy. However, the mechanisms mediating ghrelin’s effects are incompletely understood, including the extent to which its only known receptor, GHSR-1a, is required for these effects. This study characterizes the pathways involved in AT atrophy in the Lewis Lung Carcinoma (LLC)-induced cachexia model and those mediating the effects of ghrelin in Ghsr+/+ and Ghsr−/− mice. We show that LLC causes AT atrophy by inducing anorexia, and increasing AT inflammation, thermogenesis and energy expenditure. These changes were greater in Ghsr−/−. Ghrelin administration prevented LLC-induced anorexia only in Ghsr+/+, but prevented WAT inflammation and atrophy in both genotypes, although its effects were greater in Ghsr+/+. LLC-induced increases in BAT inflammation, WAT and BAT thermogenesis, and energy expenditure were not affected by ghrelin. In conclusion, ghrelin ameliorates WAT inflammation, fat atrophy and anorexia in LLC-induced cachexia. GHSR-1a is required for ghrelin’s orexigenic effect but not for its anti-inflammatory or fat-sparing effects.","Liu, Haiming; Luo, Jiaohua; Guillory, Bobby; Chen, Ji-an; Zang, Pu; Yoeli, Jordan K.; Hernandez, Yamileth; Lee, Ian (In-gi); Anderson, Barbara; Storie, Mackenzie; Tewnion, Alison; Garcia, Jose M.",bioRxiv,122,20

Validation and standardization of accurate serological assays are crucial for the surveillance of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and population immunity. Methods. We describe the analytical and clinical performance of an in-house fluorescent multiplex immunoassay (FMIA) for simultaneous quantification of antibodies against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleoprotein and spike glycoprotein. Furthermore, we calibrated IgG-FMIA against World Health Organisation (WHO) International Standard and compared FMIA results to an in-house enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and a microneutralisation test (MNT). We also compared the MNT results of two laboratories. Results. IgG-FMIA displayed 100% specificity and sensitivity for samples collected 13-150 days post-onset of symptoms (DPO). For IgA- and IgM-FMIA 100% specificity and sensitivity were obtained for a shorter time window (13-36 and 13-28 DPO for IgA- and IgM-FMIA, respectively). FMIA and EIA results displayed moderate to strong correlation, but FMIA was overall more specific and sensitive. IgG-FMIA identified 100% of samples with neutralising antibodies (NAbs). Anti-spike IgG concentrations correlated strongly ({rho}=0.77-0.84, P<2.2x10-16) with NAb titers. The NAb titers of the two laboratories displayed a very strong correlation ({rho}=0.95, P<2.2x10-16). Discussion. Our results indicate good correlation and concordance of antibody concentrations measured with different types of in-house SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays. Calibration against WHO international standard did not, however, improve the comparability of FMIA and EIA results. keywords: SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, antibody, immunoassay, nucleoprotein, spike glycoprotein, WHO international standard, neutralising antibodies, microneutralisation, receptor-binding domain","Solastie, A.; Virta, C.; Haveri, A.; EkstroÌm, N.; Kantele, A.; Miettinen, S.; Lempainen, J.; Jalkanen, P.; Kakkola, L.; Dub, T.; Julkunen, I.; Melin, M.",,122,12

Although their loss or dysfunction is associated with many diseases, it remains unclear how ZP proteins assemble in aECMs. Current models suggest that ZP proteins polymerize via their ZPn subdomains, while ZPc subdomains modulate ZPn behavior. Using the model organism C. elegans, we investigated the aECM assembly of one ZP protein, LET-653, which shapes several tubes. Contrary to prevailing models, we find that LET-653 localizes and functions via its ZPc domain. Furthermore, the ZPc domain is inhibited by the ZPn domain and cleavage of the LET-653 C-terminus relieves this inhibition. In vitro, the ZPc, but not ZPn, domain formed crystalline aggregates. These data offer a new model for ZP function whereby the ZPc domain is primarily responsible for matrix incorporation and tissue shaping.","Cohen, Jennifer D.; Bermudez, Jessica G.; Good, Matthew C.; Sundaram, Meera V.",bioRxiv,122,23

Nivolumab was tested in the neoadjuvant setting with similar responses with pathological CR, 47%. Methods: Adjuvant pilot study (NCT03798639) with two immunotherapy regimens administered for one year to patients with completely resected MCC at high risk of recurrence (primary lesion of 2 cm2 or greater, positive or close margins ( &lt; 2 cm), perineural or lymphovascular invasion, mitotic index ≥ 20 mitotic figures per mm2 , lymph node involvement (stage pIIIA or pIIIB) with or without extracapsular extension, or completely resected stage IV disease). Arm 1, nivolumab 480 mg q 4 wks and radiation therapy (RT) 50-60 Gy in 25-30 fractions, per standard of care. Arm 2, nivolumab 240 mg q 2 wks and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg q 6 wks. Primary objective was feasibility and completion of treatment in this population. Safety profile (CTCAE v5.0) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) after 18 months were secondary endpoints. Patients were randomly allocated 1:1. Results: Ten patients were screened from January 2019 until April 2020, when COVID put the study on hold and the sponsor discontinued the free drug supply. Seven were enrolled. Four were allocated to Arm 1 and three to Arm 2. Patient characteristics in Table. All patients have completed treatment and are in follow-up. Arm 1: all four patients completed radiation therapy and immunotherapy with no dose modifications or delays. Arm 2: one patient had nivolumab delayed 2 weeks for cellulitis, and another missed the last four last doses of nivolumab for cholecystitis and pancreatitis requiring surgery, unrelated to the immunotherapy. Adverse events (AE) were as expected. Arm1 caused more grade 2 and 3 AEs then Arm2 (no grade 3). One patient each discontinued treatment, in Arm 1 for progression and Arm 2 for immunotoxicity (temporal arteritis grade 2). One recurrence was observed in Arm 1 and none in Arm 2. Conclusions: The number of patients expected to recur at 1 year is 20%. Our observed data is insufficient to establish efficacy. However with no patient recurring in the ipilimumab arm after 18 months of follow-up and lower observed side effects, we would favor this regimen for the next trial.","Wu, R. C. H.; Kendra, K.

This study aims to evaluate the decisions of doctors who've resigned or retired during the COVID-19 pandemic from a sociological perspective. This qualitative research was conducted online using the semi-structured face-to-face interview technique with physician interviewees. Of the interviewees (Mage = 50.9 years), 9 had resigned and 10 had decided to retire. When coding the interview statements, the factors affecting the decision to leave employment were investigated such as organizational problems, managerial approaches, the conditions for cognizance in performing and understanding the profession, personality traits, and approaches in their immediate environment. During the pandemic, healthcare workers' acts of resigning or retiring have been explained through the fear of being infected/infecting someone else, problems in the health system, intense work conditions, and feeling burned out due to not knowing how long the process will take. In the context of the crisis as an anomie in which the individual loses faith in society and social solidarity dissolves, the main factors setting the basis for leaving work have been identified as unfair distribution of tasks, organizational disorders, ambiguity regarding the concept of responsibility due to uncertainty, collegiate behaviors that shirk duty, lack of appreciation, and personality traits. The imbalance in exchange with society has led individuals to choose to give themselves the rewards that they are unable to get from others. This research performs a kind of autopsy to understand the factors behind cases of resignation and retirement during the COVID-19 pandemic and what needs to be done to prevent this from turning into a contagion turnover.","Ergur, Göksel Altınışık Nuhoğlu Şadiye Çobanoğlu Cansu Çetin Nazlı Bostan Pınar Ergur Ali",Sosyoloji Dergisi,122,1

As physical distancing measures were established, we rapidly shifted our outpatient appointments to TM. Here we show findings regarding patient TM perception and attendance. Patient demographics and attendance to in person and TM outpatient encounters from January to July 2020 were reviewed. A survey evaluating TM perceptions was distributed to patients and their families following an encounter between March and July 2020. Our diabetes clinic currently cares for 1504 unique patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) with 46% being publicly insured. A total of 1,653 encounters including in person and TM were included in the analysis. TM visits became available in March 2020, with a total of 571 encounters by July 2020. There was a significantly lower number of completed TM encounters by publicly insured patients when compared with privately insured (p value=0.03523) and a threefold increase in no-shows and same day cancelations by the publicly insured group. Perception of TM was addressed with a survey completed by 40 patients. TM perception was positive with 86% of patients being very satisfied with the visit. TM encounter was thought to be the same as in person encounter by 60% and better than in person visit by 37% of patients. Reported benefits associated with TM included: overall time saved, no missed school day for the patient or workday for the parent, decreased childcare and transportation costs. In conclusion, although TM is perceived as positive by patients with T1D, low-income families showed lower TM visit attendance rate when compared to privately insured families. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted disparities related to access to and use of technology to improve diabetes care. More research is needed to identify the specific causes for the disparities. Patient centered approach to increase education and help navigate the processes required for utilizing TM technology may help decrease the health equity gaps.","Demeterco-Berggren, Carla Gottschalk Michael",Diabetes,122,17

Indeed, COVID19 increases the risk of cardiovascular occlusive/thrombotic events and is linked to poor outcomes. The pathophysiological processes underlying COVID19-induced thrombosis are complex, and remain poorly understood. To this end, platelets play important roles in regulating our cardiovascular system, including via contributions to coagulation and inflammation. There is an ample of evidence that circulating platelets are activated in COVID19 patients, which is a primary driver of the thrombotic outcome observed in these patients. However, the comprehensive molecular basis of platelet activation in COVID19 disease remains elusive, which warrants more investigation. Hence, we employed gene co-expression network analysis combined with pathways enrichment analysis to further investigate the aforementioned issues. Our study revealed three important gene clusters/modules that were closely related to COVID19. Furthermore, enrichment analysis showed that these three modules were mostly related to platelet metabolism, protein translation, mitochondrial activity, and oxidative phosphorylation, as well as regulation of megakaryocyte differentiation, and apoptosis, suggesting a hyperactivation status of platelets in COVID19. We identified the three hub genes from each of three key modules according to their intramodular connectivity value ranking, namely: COPE, CDC37, CAPNS1, AURKAIP1, LAMTOR2, GABARAP MT-ND1, MT-ND5, and MTRNR2L12. Collectively, our results offer a new and interesting insight into platelet involvement in COVID19 disease at the molecular level, which might aid in defining new targets for treatment of COVID19–induced thrombosis. key points Co-expression analysis of platelet RNAseq from COVID19 patients show distinct clusters of genes (modules) that are highly correlated to COVID19 disease.

However, representations learned by autoencoders are hard to interpret and representations learned by factor models have limited flexibility. Here, we introduce a framework for learning interpretable autoencoders based on regularized linear decoders. It decomposes variation into interpretable components using prior knowledge in the form of annotated feature sets obtained from public databases. Through this, it provides an alternative to enrichment techniques and factor models for the task of explaining observed variation with biological knowledge. Benchmarking our model on two single-cell RNA-seq datasets, we demonstrate how our model outperforms an existing factor model regarding scalability while maintaining interpretability.","Rybakov, Sergei; Lotfollahi, Mohammad; Theis, Fabian J.; Wolf, F.

Yet, the patterns of neuronal connectivity that underlie such multisensory integration remain poorly characterized. The Drosophila melanogaster mushroom body — an associative center required for the formation of olfactory and visual memories — is an ideal system to investigate how different sensory channels converge in higher-order brain centers. The neurons connecting the mushroom body to the olfactory system have been described in great detail, but input from other sensory systems remains poorly defined. Here, we use a range of anatomical and genetic techniques to identify two novel types of mushroom body input neuron that connect visual processing centers — namely the lobula and the posterior lateral protocerebrum — to the dorsal accessory calyx of the mushroom body. Together with previous work that described a pathway conveying visual information from the medulla to the ventral accessory calyx of the mushroom body (Vogt et al., 2016), our study defines a second, parallel pathway that is anatomically poised to convey information from the visual system to the dorsal accessory calyx. This connectivity pattern — the segregation of the visual information into two separate pathways — could be a fundamental feature of the neuronal architecture underlying multisensory integration in associative brain centers.","Li, Jinzhi; Mahoney, Brennan Dale; Jacob, Miles Solomon; Caron, Sophie Jeanne Cécile",bioRxiv,122,1

National data, comprising news media reports and publically available documents, are analysed and compared to identify debates about the public good and their consequences within and across national contexts. Our analysis contrasts policy contexts on three dimensions: (a) the range of interests included in debates;(b) the form and locus of decision-making;and (c) public acceptance of policy during implementation. These are related to processes of depoliticising debate and politicising research evidence in each context, as factions position themselves as trustworthy. We suggest that the way research is seen to inform decision-making during crises such as the current COVID-19 pandemic has enduring consequences for public trust in research, the politicians who employ it to justify their decisions and the schools tasked with putting these decisions into practice.","Kelly, Peter Hofbauer Susann Gross Barbara",European Educational Research Journal,122,1

Free-text notes are unstructured data harder to use in machine learning while structured diagnostic codes can be missing or even erroneous. To improve the quality of diagnostic codes, this work extracts structured diagnostic codes from the unstructured notes concerning cardiovascular diseases. Five old and new word embeddings were used to vectorize over 5 million progress notes from Stanford EHR and logistic regression was used to predict eight ICD-10 codes of common cardiovascular diseases. The models were interpreted by the important words in predictions and analyses of false positive cases. Trained on Stanford notes, the model transferability was tested in the prediction of corresponding ICD-9 codes of the MIMIC-III discharge summaries. The word embeddings and logistic regression showed good performance in the diagnostic code extraction with TF-IDF as the best word embedding model showing AUROC ranging from 0.9499 to 0.9915 and AUPRC ranging from 0.2956 to 0.8072. The models also showed transferability when tested on MIMIC-III data set with AUROC ranging from 0.7952 to 0.9790 and AUPRC ranging from 0.2353 to 0.8084. Model interpretability was showed by the important words with clinical meanings matching each disease. This study shows the feasibility to accurately extract structured diagnostic codes, impute missing codes and correct erroneous codes from free-text clinical notes with interpretable models for clinicians, which helps improve the data quality of diagnostic codes for information retrieval and downstream machine-learning applications.","Zhan, X.; Humbert-Droz, M.; Mukherjee, P.; Gevaert, O.",,122,1

This defines the necessity to find appropriate combinations of factors characterizing the vulnerability of a region. The methodology and tools to explain the regional specifics of population vulnerability to COVID-19 are investigated through a systematic consideration of many public health factors, environmental, social and economic specific nature of regions. The aim of the article is to study the reasons for regional differentiation of population vulnerability (morbidity and mortality rates) from COVID-19. The authors investigate a nonlinear spatial model in which the stepwise algorithm of individual factor variables is added/removed from the model specifications step by step by the Aitken method depending on their correlation with morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 in the region. The Farrar-Glober method is used to eliminate the multicollinearity of factors, the Spearman test is used to detect the heteroskedastic effect, and the Darbin-Watson test is used to check the presence of autocorrelation between the residues. As a result, the specification of the model with the highest adequacy in terms of p-value and t-statistics is formed. Relevant socioecological-economic vulnerability indices of regions to mortality and morbidity from COVID-19 are identified. The obtained results allow making adjustments in the state and regional programs concerning the mobilization of economic and healthcare systems.","Kuzmenko, O.; Vasylieva, T.; Vojtovic, S.; Chygryn, O.; Snieska, V.",Economics & Sociology,122,16

Cross-sectional data were collected online using CloudResearch from 296 adults residing in the United States of America during August 2020. A strong positive relationship was found between impact of trauma and PTG (r = .54;p &lt; .001). Moderated multiple regression indicated psychological distress, perceived social support, age, gender, ethnicity, and education accounted for 39% of the variance in PTG;however, a significant positive relationship was only found between social support and PTG. The interaction between social support and psychological distress was significant (p = .021), with slope indicating the relationship between distress and PTG is strengthened with increasing social support. Contrary to expectations, this study found a significant relationship existed between PTG and perceived support from friends (beta = .23;p = .001) and family (beta = .14, p = .044), but not significant others. Age also predicted PTG, suggesting younger people may experience higher growth, and significant mean differences were found between Caucasian and African American participants who reported higher levels of PTG.

Patients who tested positive for COVID-19 are mostly asymptomatic or present with mild self-limiting symptoms. While GI symptoms occur with less prevalence, they are increasingly being reported. A diagnosis of Covid-19 has increased dramatically in patients presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms suggesting that GI symptoms should be taken into serious consideration with patient diagnosis. Case 1: A 65-year-old man presented to the hospital emergency room with abdominal pain, Murphy's sign and chills without fever, subsequently diagnosed as acute acalculous cholecystitis with a positive COVID-19 rRT-PCR. Case 2: A 78-year-old woman presented to the hospital emergency room complaining of severe positional epigastric pain precipitated by lying supine, chills with no fever, being later diagnosed as acute pancreatitis and a positive COVID-19 rRT-PCR.

The mRNA expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-6, were up-regulated with protozoan DNA load increasing. In addition, the level of a type-2 cytokine (IL-10) transcript was also increased during the acute phase. In contrast, the down-regulation or no detectable levels of the expression of type-1 cytokines, such as IL-2 and interferon (IFN)-gamma were observed in T. parva-infected animals. Thus, our observations indicated that high protozoan load and resulting intense inflammatory responses might be involved in the severity of clinical signs observed in T. parva-infection.","Yamada, Shinji; Konnai, Satoru; Imamura, Saiki; Simuunza, Martin; Chembensofu, Mwelwa; Chota, Amos; Nambota, Andrew; Onuma, Misao; Ohashi, Kazuhiko",The Journal of veterinary medical science,122,4

Our university hospital was confronted to the very need of specific reorganizations guided by the implementation of the Hospital Emergency Plan.This article aims to describe the experience of the University Hospital of Liège (CHU Liège) during the COVID-19 outbreak and demonstrates the efficiency of advanced triage centers to regulate hospital admissions from the emergency department (ED). METHODS since the beginning of March 2020, the CHU of Liège has implemented specific advanced triage centers to manage patients with SARS-CoV-2 suspected symptoms. The first center was organized inside the hospital but the need of outside structures led to the creation of two centers by the end of March. From March 2 to May 3, data from the different visits at the COVID-19 centers were collected (numbers of admissions, rationale for coming, work up and outcome). RESULTS during the study period, 3,094 patients were admitted to the specific COVID-19 centers of the CHU Liège. This represents 3,431 visits among which 337 were classified as readmission visits. The sensitivity and specificity of the triage centers to determine the need for hospitalization were, respectively, estimated at 87,9 % and 93,4 %. CONCLUSION our experience tends to demonstrate the role of specific COVID-19 triage centers located very close to the EDs aimed at managing COVID-19 suspected patients in order to actually determine their need for subsequent hospitalization.","Gilbert, A; Piazza, J; Szecel, J; Ancion, A; Gensburger, M; Lopez, R; D'Orio, V; Ghuysen, A",Revue medicale de Liege,122,7

Limited studies showed that smokers were at higher risk of having severe complications and higher mortality. We aimed to analyze the possible correlation between adult tobacco smoking prevalence and COVID-19 mortality all over the world. METHODS this correlation study involved a linear regression to analyse the correlation between smoking prevalence data in adults and COVID-19 Case Fatality Ratio (CFR) in countries with 1000 confirmed COVID-19 cases on May 3, 2020. RESULTS seventy-five countries included with median CFR 3.66%. There was no relationship between adult male or female smoking prevalence and COVID-19 mortality in all over the countries. The multivariate analysis showed p-values of 0.823 and 0.910 for male and female smoking prevalence, respectively. However, in lower-middle-income countries (LMIC), there was a positive correlation between the prevalence of adult male smoking with the mortality of COVID-19. Each increment of one percentage of adult male smoking prevalence was associated with increase in COVID-19 CFR by 0.08% (95% CI 0.00%-0.15%, p=0.041). CONCLUSION there is correlation between the prevalence of adult male smoking and the CFR of COVID-19 in lower middle-income countries. Based on these findings, strengthening of tobacco control policies is essential to reduce the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic especially in LMIC. This still warrants further studies.","Magfira, Nadya; Helda, Helda",Acta medica Indonesiana,122,1

METHODS This retrospective cohort study included all patients 15 years or younger who were admitted to the trauma centre at Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark from January 2000 to May 2014. Injury severity was calculated using the Injury Severity Score (ISS). The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to determine significant differences between sexes. RESULTS A total of 880 children (499 boys and 391 girls) were included. No significant sex-related differences were observed in the numbers admitted during the study period, age at admission or severity of injuries. Overall, 30% of the paediatric patients were admitted in the afternoon (3-6 p.m.). The crude death rate was 2.7% of all admissions. Traffic accidents accounted for 48% of all admissions and two-thirds of all deaths. All non-survivors received ISSs of 16 or higher, and 20% of deaths in this group and 42% of overall deaths occurred within the first 24 hours. CONCLUSIONS Our study suggests that in Denmark, children admitted to a trauma centre are most likely to have been injured in traffic accidents and/or in the afternoon. Deaths were few and limited to the severely injured children; many survived despite severe injuries. FUNDING none.

Findings show that Dutch GPs are positive about the quality of GP care and that they are satisfied with their profession. However, findings also show that there is room for improvement. (i) Work pressure and work-related stress among GPs is high in the Netherlands, which may be due to moves to substitute primary care for some hospital care. (ii) Dutch GPs are behind other high-income countries in their uptake of some digital applications (e.g. video consultations).

A newly identified ER-membrane-associated protein, DRiP78, binds to this motif. Overexpression or sequestration of DRiP78 leads to retention of D1 receptors in the ER, reduced ligand binding, and a slowdown in the kinetics of receptor glycosylation.

Action-oriented analysis of pandemics requires a broad inclusion of academic disciplines since no one domain can cover a significant fraction of the problem. Numerous research papers and action plans have treated pandemics as purely medical happenings, focusing on hospitals, health care professionals, creation and distribution of vaccines and anti-virals, etc. But human behavior with regard to hygiene and social distancing constitutes a first-order partial brake or control of the spread and intensity of infection. Such behavioral options are ""non-pharmaceutical interventions."" (NPIs) The chapter employs simple mathematical models to study alternative controls of infection, addressing a well-known parameter in epidemiology, R0, the ""reproductive number,"" defined as the mean number of new infections generated by an index case. Values of R0 greater than 1.0 usually indicate that the infection begins with exponential growth, the generation-to-generation growth rate being R0. R0 is broken down into constituent parts related to the frequency and intensity of human contacts, both partially under our control. It is suggested that any numerical value for R0 has little meaning outside the social context to which it pertains. Difference equation models are then employed to study the effects of heterogeneity of population social contact rates, the analysis showing that the disease tends to be driven by high frequency individuals. Related analyses show the futility of trying geographically to isolate the disease. Finally, the models are operated under a variety of assumptions related to social distancing and changes in hygienic behavior. The results are promising in terms of potentially reducing the total impact of the pandemic.","Larson, Richard C; Nigmatulina, Karima R",Studies in health technology and informatics,122,16

The disease was qualified by World Health Organisation (WHO) experts as 'progressive and very gradually developing renal failure with insidious onset.... The last stage shows marked fibrosis...'. BEN is characterized by tubular degeneration, interstitial fibrosis and hyalinization of glomeruli accompanied by enzymuria and impaired renal function without nephrotic syndrome. Later, an association between BEN and tumours of the kidney pelvis and ureter was recognized, so that the problem of BEN became not only nephrological, but also oncological. There may also be an association with increased urinary bladder cancer incidence, although many confounding factors may interfere in the analysis of data for this organ. In view of the very intimate association between BEN and the urinary tract tumours (UTT), the term 'endemic uropathy' has been proposed. Several hypothesis concerning the aetiology of these diseases has been investigated, which include: predisposing genes factors, environmental factors (heavy metals, minerals, bacteria, leptospira, viruses, fungal toxins and, most recently, pliocene lignites). This paper reviews the different hypotheses about the aetiology of endemic uropathy and pays particular attention to the role of fungal toxins.","Pfohl-Leszkowicz, A; Petkova-Bocharova, T; Chernozemsky, I N; Castegnaro, M",Food additives and contaminants,122,1

This in vitro study will serve as the foundation for development of novel anti-SARS therapeutics. METHODS 48 siRNA sequences were designed for targeting regions throughout entire SARS-CoV genome RNA including open-reading frames for several key proteins. Chemically synthesized siRNA duplexes were transfected into foetal rhesus kidney (FRhK-4) cells prior to or after SARS-CoV infection. The inhibitory effects of the siRNAs were evaluated for reductions of intracellular viral genome copy number and viral titres in the cell culture medium measured by Q-RT-PCR and CPE-based titration, respectively. Four siRNA duplexes were found to achieve potent inhibition of SARS-CoV infection and replication. A prolonged prophylactic effect of siRNA duplexes with up to 90% inhibition that lasted for at least 72 h was observed. Combination of active siRNA duplexes targeting different regions of the viral genome resulted in therapeutic activity of up to 80% inhibition. CONCLUSION Chemically synthesized siRNA duplexes targeting SARS-CoV genomic RNA are potent agents for inhibition of the viral infection and replication. The location effects of siRNAs were revealed at both genome sequence and open-reading frame levels. The rapid development of siRNA-based SARS-CoV inhibitors marked a novel approach for combating newly emergent infectious diseases.","Zheng, Bo-jian; Guan, Yi; Tang, Qingquan; Du, Cheng; Xie, Frank Y; He, Ming-Liang; Chan, Kwok-Wah; Wong, Kin-Ling; Lader, Eric; Woodle, Martin C; Lu, Patrick Y; Li, Baojian; Zhong, Nanshan",Antiviral therapy,122,1

These attributes include absorbing exudate, providing optimum moisture balance at the wound surface, and preventing maceration of surrounding tissue. However, studies suggest that controlling wound bioburden should also be targeted when developing wound therapeutics. Thus, traditional foam dressings may absorb a copious amount of fluid, but may also provide an environment where microbes can grow unchallenged, leading to an increase in wound bioburden. However, antimicrobial foam dressings may prevent or reduce microbial growth, increasing the potential for wound healing. Studies reported herein evaluated the efficacy of 0.5% polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) treated dressings to prevent the growth of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). An antimicrobial foam (Kendall™ AMD, Covidien, Mansfield, MA), which contains PHMB and a standard foam dressing (Copa™, Covidien, Mansfield, MA), which contains no PHMB (control), were directly inoculated with clinical isolate of MRSA and placed on a growth medium for selected time intervals. The presence or absence of microbial growth was quantified using plate counts and was visually assessed using scanning electron microscopy. At all time points, the antimicrobial foam dressing significantly reduced the MRSA growth compared to the control dressing.

MERS is caused by a novel betacoronavirus (MERS-CoV). All cases of MERS have been linked through travel to or residence in countries in or near the Arabian Peninsula. Dromedary camels are considered natu- ral reservoirs for MERS-CoV. MERS-CoV is mainly transmitted from infected dromedary camels to human beings, and it is transmitted among human beings by droplets, contact, and perhaps airborne spread. Both community-acquired and hospital-acquired cases have been reported with little human-to-human transmis- sion reported in the community. The largest known outbreak of MERS outside the Arabian Peninsula oc- curred in the Republic of Korea in 2015, with 186 cases. The outbreak was associated with a traveler re- turning from the Arabian Peninsula. Clinical features of MERS range from asymptomatic or mild disease to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ failure resulting in death, especially in individuals with underlying comorbidities. MERS is suspected in the presence of febrile acute respiratory illness and close contact with MERS-CoV, and can be confirmed by the detection of viral nucleic acid through RT-PCR or se- rology. No specific drug treatment exists for MERS; however, the neutralizing antibodies, ribavirin and interferon have been shown to be potentially useful anti-MERS-CoV drugs.

As of 31 May 2013, there was a total of 131 reported human infections in China, with a cumulative mortality of 29% (38/131). The outbreak affected 10 provinces, with 106 of the cases being concentrated in the eastern coastal provinces of Zhejiang, Shanghai and Jiangsu. Statistically significant spatial clustering of cumulative human cases was identified by the Cuzick–Edwards’ k-nearest neighbour method. Three spatio-temporal clusters of cases were detected by space–time scan analysis. The principal cluster covered 18 counties in Zhejiang during 3 to 18 April (relative risk (RR): 26.39;p<0.0001), while two secondary clusters in March and April covered 21 counties along the provincial boundary between Shanghai and Jiangsu (RR: 6.35;p<0.0001) and two counties in Jiangsu (RR: 72.48;p=0.0025). The peak of the outbreak was in the eastern coastal provinces of Zhejiang, Shanghai and Jiangsu that was characterised by statistically significant spatio-temporal aggregation, with a particularly high incidence in March and April 2013.","Liu, W; Yang, K; Qi, X; Xu, K; Ji, H; Ai, J; Ge, A; Wu, Y; Li, Y; Dai, Q; Liang, Q; Bao, C; Bergquist, R; Tang, F; Zhu, Y",Euro surveillance : bulletin Europeen sur les maladies transmissibles = European communicable disease bulletin,122,15

Alternative splicing and genomic polymorphism generate DC-SIGN mRNA variants, which have been detected at sites of pathogen entrance and transmission. We present evidence that DC-SIGN neck variants are expressed on dendritic and myeloid cells at the RNA and protein levels. Structural analysis revealed that multimerization of DC-SIGN within a cellular context depends on the lectin domain and the number and arrangement of the repeats within the neck region, whose glycosylation negatively affects oligomer formation. Naturally occurring DC-SIGN neck variants differ in multimerization competence in the cell membrane, exhibit altered sugar binding ability, and retain pathogen-interacting capacity, implying that pathogen-induced cluster formation predominates over the basal multimerization capability. Analysis of DC-SIGN neck polymorphisms indicated that the number of allelic variants is higher than previously thought and that multimerization of the prototypic molecule is modulated in the presence of allelic variants with a different neck structure. Our results demonstrate that the presence of allelic variants or a high level of expression of neck domain splicing isoforms might influence the presence and stability of DC-SIGN multimers on the cell surface, thus providing a molecular explanation for the correlation between DC-SIGN polymorphisms and altered susceptibility to HIV-1 and other pathogens.","Serrano-Gómez, Diego; Sierra-Filardi, Elena; Martínez-Nuñez, Rocío T; Caparrós, Esther; Delgado, Rafael; Muñoz-Fernández, Mari Angeles; Abad, María Antonia; Jimenez-Barbero, Jesús; Leal, Manuel; Corbí, Angel L",The Journal of biological chemistry,122,16

Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib represents an effective treatment for R/R MCL patients. We investigated ibrutinib efficacy and safety in daily clinical practice, together with factors that could predict disease outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS We retrospectively analyzed 69 consecutive R/R MCL patients managed in 10 Tuscan onco-hematological centers. The treatment regimen consisted of oral, continuous, single-agent ibrutinib, maximum dosage of 560 mg once per day, until disease progression. RESULTS Overall response rate was 62.3%, with a CR rate of 39.1%. After a median follow-up of 15.6 months, 40/69 patients (58%) were alive, the main cause of death was progressive disease (PD, 22/69 cases, 31.9%). Median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 17 and 34.8 months. Inferior PFS was associated with >1 prior line of therapy and B symptoms. Ibrutinib refractoriness was associated with inferior OS, median OS after ibrutinib failure was only 5 months.

The interviews were collected from July to September 2020 by senior volunteers (60+) of the non-commercial organization «House of Projects» (St. Petersburg). The most difficult informants endured spatial isolation in their own apartments and the inability to take walks, maintain live communication, lack of reliable information about pamdemic. In the case of medical care, many were forced to cancel scheduled visits and examinations, postpone surgery indefinitely, and also experienced difficulties in obtaining prescription drugs, glasses and dental care. On the positive side during the quarantine period, elderly informants noted the development of youth volunteer movement and assistance, the development of mobile devices and online communication methods, and the establishment of closer emotional ties with relatives. In summary, we can say that the strict restrictions on leaving homes for the older people, and intimidation «from TV», lack of reliable information, restrictions on access to health care, clearly observed during the quarantine period, do not correspond to the responsible care for citizens by state.","Parfenova, O A",Advances in gerontology = Uspekhi gerontologii,122,5

This sequence contained a single long open reading frame with a coding capacity of 1363 amino acids (Mr 150,747). The predicted protein had 19 N-glycosylation sites. A signal sequence comprising 17 amino acids was observed starting from the first methionine residue. A potential peptidase cleavage site was located between amino acids 763 and 767. These cleavage explain the maturation of the primary product of the S gene to S1 (Mr 104,692) and S2 (Mr 84,175) spike structural proteins.

METHODS The clinical specimens of the nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum (or saliva), urine, fecal specimens were collected on three consecutive days from 8 patients with SARS 2 years after the recovery from SARS. SARS-CoV, reovirus and poliovirus RNA was detected by using reverse transcription (RT)-PCR; IgG antibody to the poliovirus type 1 and 3 and the antibody to SARS-CoV were determined using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS All the specimens were negative for SARS-CoV and reovirus by RT-PCR, but the fecal specimens from 4 persons were positive for poliovirus. The sequences of these poliovirus were highly homologous to that of human poliovirus type 1 strain sabin 1 genome at nucleotide level, but back mutations have occurred in the primary attenuating mutation sites at nucleotide position 480 (G --> A) in the 5' UTR and the nucleotide position 2795 (A --> G). No SARS-CoV, reovirus, and poliovirus were found in the normal controls. Three serum specimens were positive for the antibody to SARS-CoV. The IgG antibody to poliovirus were detected in 4 SARS patients and 23 healthy persons. No positive results for antibody to SARS-CoV were detected in the 25 healthy persons. CONCLUSION The positive rate of the poliovirus antibody in the serum of SARS patients 2 years after recovery was significantly different from that of the normal controls, and the positive rate of poliovirus in the fecal specimens was still very high, and more importantly back mutations have occurred in the attenuating mutation sites at nucleotide position which plays an important role in the poliomyelitis.","Sun, Ying; Xin, Shao-jie; Shen, Hong-hui; Hu, Yan; Xu, Dong-ping; Zhu, Hong; Zhu, Lei; Duan, Qing; Mao, Pan-yong",Zhonghua shi yan he lin chuang bing du xue za zhi = Zhonghua shiyan he linchuang bingduxue zazhi = Chinese journal of experimental and clinical virology,122,1

Decisions should be taken (and seen to be taken) on advice from multidisciplinary teams of scientists and representatives from all groups significantly affected by the disease (the 'stakeholders'). Changes in trade and travel mean that, unless a new model is developed for disease prevention, there is a real possibility that transboundary animal diseases will become increasingly difficult to control. The traditional government approach of dealing almost exclusively with the commercial sector of the livestock industry is no longer sufficient, and new ways must be found to include all sectors, including 'grey' husbandry (fragmented, disparate groups whose involvement with animals may range from the legal and responsible to the unsanctioned and/or illegal). The increasing convergence of human and animal health issues makes it imperative to make the best possible use of new tools. The particular challenges confronting veterinary science are: preventing the introduction of disease, rapidly identifying disease and controlling epidemics.

COVID-19 has no vaccine or specific therapy; its mortality rate increases significantly once patients deteriorate. Furthermore, intensive monitoring of COVID-19 is limited by insufficient medical resources and increased risks of exposure to medical staff. We therefore aim to build an early warning and rapid response system (EWRRS) to address these problems. METHOD: The research is designed as a prospective cohort study, to verify a dynamic and interactive evaluation system; it includes patient self-reporting, active monitoring, early alarming and treatment recommendations. Adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 will be recruited from Sept 2020 to Aug 2021 at a tertiary contagious hospital. Patients with life expectancy <48âhours, pregnant or lactating, in immunosuppression states or end-stage diseases will be excluded. The intervention is implementation of EWRRS to detect early signs of clinical deterioration of COVID-19 patients, to provide timely and efficient treatment suggestions by the system. EWRRS can determine the classification and interactive evaluation of patient information; the determination is based on the application of 3 different scenario modules, separately driven by patients, nurses, and physicians. The primary outcome is change in disease severity category after treatment. Secondary outcomes include the proportion of patients with different disease severity types; critical deterioration events; patients who had unplanned transfers to an intensive care unit (ICU) and required critical care interventions; intervals from warning to implementation of clinical interventions; hospital mortality; length of ICU and hospital stay; workload of medical staff and risks of exposure to COVID-19. DISCUSSION: Our hypothesis is that EWRRS provides an example of an early identification, warning, and response system for COVID-19. In addition, EWRRS can potentially be extended to use as a grading metric for general critically ill patients in an ICU setting.","Zhou, Hua; Huang, Huibin; Xie, Xiaolei; Gao, Jiandong; Wu, Ji; Zhu, Yan; He, Wei; Liu, Jingyuan; Li, Ang; Xu, Yuan",Medicine (Baltimore),122,6

In this pandemic, cancer patients are prone to become critically ill after being infected with COVID-19 due to special immune conditions, and cannot effectively benefit from the treatment plan designed for normal people. However, only a few literatures report the differences between cancer patients and normal people after being infected with COVID-19. There is no systematic review to evaluate the clinical, inflammatory, and immune differences between COVID-19 patients with and without cancer. The systematic review aims to summarize and analyze the clinical, inflammatory, and immune differences between them. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We plan to conduct a systematic review according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines. Several databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, The Cochrane Library, CNKI, CBM, VIP, WanFang) were searched for relevant eligible observational studies on COVID-19 patients with cancer published from December 2019 to September 2020. Two researchers (Y.ZY and W.PP) will independently complete search strategy formulation, literature selecting, Information extraction, data collation, and quality assessment. The primary outcome will be the clinical characteristics differences between COVID-19 patients with and without cancer. Secondary outcomes will include immune function regulation characteristics such as T cell subset status, inflammation and other factors for COVID-19 patients with cancer. We intend to perform a meta-analysis of studies calculating odds ratio differences (Hedge g) for comparison in Forest plots and subgroup analysis after assessment of heterogeneity using I statistics based on compatibility on the basis of population and outcomes. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: We will use the information from published researches with no need for ethical assessment.

In an effort to provide continuous pharmaceutical care to cancer patients, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center (SYSUCC) implemented a remote pharmacy service platform based on its already existing web-based hospital app known as Cloud SYSUCC. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics, acceptance, and initial impact of the Cloud SYSUCC app during a COVID-19 outbreak in a tertiary cancer hospital in China. METHODS: The total number of online prescriptions and detailed information on the service were obtained during the first 6 months after the remote service platform was successfully set up. The patients' gender, age, residence, primary diagnosis, drug classification, weekly number of prescriptions, and prescribed drugs were analyzed. In addition, a follow-up telephonic survey was conducted to evaluate patients' satisfaction in using the remote prescription service. RESULTS: A total of 1718 prescriptions, including 2022 drugs for 1212 patients, were delivered to 24 provinces and municipalities directly under the Central Government of China between February 12, 2020, and August 11, 2020. The majority of patients were female (841/1212, 69.39%), and 90.18% (1093/1212) of them were aged 31-70 years old. The top 3 primary diagnoses for which remote medical prescriptions were made included breast cancer (599/1212, 49.42%), liver cancer (249/1212, 20.54%), and thyroid cancer (125/1212, 10.31%). Of the 1718 prescriptions delivered, 1435 (83.5%) were sent to Guangdong Province and 283 (16.5%) were sent to other provinces in China. Of the 2022 drugs delivered, 1012 (50.05%) were hormonal drugs. The general trend in the use of the remote prescription service declined since the 10th week. A follow-up telephonic survey found that 88% (88/100) of the patients were very satisfied, and 12% (12/100) of the patients were somewhat satisfied with the remote pharmacy service platform. CONCLUSIONS: The remote pharmacy platform Cloud SYSUCC is efficient and convenient for providing continuous pharmaceutical care to patients with cancer during the COVID-19 crisis. The widespread use of this platform can help to reduce person-to-person transmission as well as infection risk for these patients. Further efforts are needed to improve the quality and acceptance of the Cloud SYSUCC platform, as well as to regulate and standardize the management of this novel service.","Chen, Zhuo-Jia; Liang, Wei-Ting; Liu, Qing; He, Rong; Chen, Qian-Chao; Li, Qiu-Feng; Zhang, Yao; Du, Xiao-Dong; Pan, Ying; Liu, Shu; Li, Xiao-Yan; Wei, Xue; Huang, He; Huang, Hong-Bing; Liu, Tao",J Med Internet Res,122,26
205461,205461,205461,Exams,14.543713,4.9298787,2021,"During the course of an epidemic, one of the most challenging tasks for authorities is to decide what kind of restrictive measures to introduce and when these should be enforced. In order to take informed decisions in a fully rational manner, the onset of a critical regime, characterized by an exponential growth of the contagion, must be identified as quickly as possible. Providing rigorous quantitative tools to detect such an onset represents an important contribution from the scientific community to proactively support the political decision makers. In this paper, leveraging the quickest detection theory, we propose a mathematical model of the COVID-19 pandemic evolution and develop decision tools to rapidly detect the passage from a controlled regime to a critical one. A new sequential test-referred to as MAST (mean-agnostic sequential test)-is presented, and demonstrated on publicly available COVID-19 infection data from different countries. Then, the performance of MAST is investigated for the second pandemic wave, showing an effective trade-off between average decision delay [Formula: see text] and risk [Formula: see text], where [Formula: see text] is inversely proportional to the time required to declare the need to take unnecessary restrictive measures. To quantify risk, in this paper we adopt as its proxy the average occurrence rate of false alarms, in that a false alarm risks unnecessary social and economic disruption. Ideally, the decision mechanism should react as quick as possible for a given level of risk. We find that all the countries share the same behaviour in terms of quickest detection, specifically the risk scales exponentially with the delay, [Formula: see text], where [Formula: see text] depends on the specific nation. For a reasonably small risk level, say, one possibility in ten thousand (i.e., unmotivated implementation of countermeasures every 27 years, on the average), the proposed algorithm detects the onset of the critical regime with delay between a few days to 3 weeks, much earlier than when the exponential growth becomes evident. Strictly from the quickest-detection perspective adopted in this paper, it turns out that countermeasures against the second epidemic wave have not always been taken in a timely manner. The developed tool can be used to support decisions at different geographic scales (regions, cities, local areas, etc.), levels of risk, instantiations of controlled/critical regime, and is general enough to be applied to different pandemic time-series. Additional analysis and applications of MAST are made available on a dedicated website.","Braca, Paolo; Gaglione, Domenico; Marano, Stefano; Millefiori, Leonardo M; Willett, Peter; Pattipati, Krishna",Sci Rep,122,24

Although no systematic database exists to track such local programs, through an array of data sources including a national survey, telephone contacts, and a web review, we identified 15 states that are using local funding to support aging services. Communities are using a variety of local revenue streams, such as property tax levies, payroll, and sales taxes to provide services for older adults and/or their family or friend caregivers.

The social isolation and economic stress resulting from pandemic have the potential to exacerbate child abuse and neglect. This study examines the association of parents' perceived social isolation and recent employment loss to risk for child maltreatment (neglect, verbal aggression, and physical punishment) in the early weeks of the pandemic. Participants (N = 283) were adults living in the U.S. who were parents of at least one child 0-12 years of age. Participants completed an online survey approximately 2 weeks after the World Health Organization declared that COVID-19 was a pandemic. The survey asked about recent changes (i.e., in the past 2 weeks) to employment status, parenting behaviors, use of discipline, use of spanking, and depressive symptoms. Nearly 20% of parents had hit or spanked their child in the past two weeks alone. Parents' perceived social isolation and recent employment loss were associated with self-report of physical and emotional neglect and verbal aggression against the child, even after controlling for parental depressive symptoms, income, and sociodemographic factors. Parents' perceived social isolation was associated with parental report of changes in discipline, specifically, using discipline and spanking more often in the past 2 weeks. Associations were robust to analyses that included two variables that assessed days spent social distancing and days spent in ""lockdown.""

ARDS and systemic manifestations of COVID-19 are mainly due to an exaggerated immune response triggered by the viral infection. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS), an inflammatory syndrome characterized by elevated levels of circulating cytokines, and endothelial dysfunction are systemic manifestations of COVID-19. CRS is also an adverse event of immunotherapy (IMTX), the treatment of diseases using drugs, cells, and antibodies to stimulate or suppress the immune system. Graft-versus-host disease complications after an allogeneic stem cell transplant, toxicity after the infusion of chimeric antigen receptor-T cell therapy and monoclonal antibodies can all lead to CRS. It is hypothesized that anti-inflammatory drugs used for treatment of CRS in IMTX may be useful in reducing the mortality in COVID-19, whereas IMTX itself may help in ameliorating effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this paper, we focused on the potential shared mechanisms and differences between COVID-19 and IMTX-related toxicities. We performed a systematic review of the clinical trials testing anti-inflammatory therapies and of the data published from prospective trials. Preliminary evidence suggests there might be a benefit in targeting the cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, especially by inhibiting the interleukin-6 pathway. Many other approaches based on novel drugs and cell therapies are currently under investigation and may lead to a reduction in hospitalization and mortality due to COVID-19.","Iovino, Lorenzo; Thur, Laurel A; Gnjatic, Sacha; Chapuis, Aude; Milano, Filippo; Hill, Joshua A",J. immunotherap. cancer,122,1

The priority of project resumption was evaluated using basic characteristics, the long- and short-term strategies, and the regional pandemic situation. The energy level of skilled workers was graded according to construction team size, skill level, and experience. Sustainable allocation principles and paths were explored to target four different types of work resumption plans. We used the cellular automaton (CA) technique to simulate the sustainable allocation model. We also analyzed the similarity function of energy levels and the time-cost function of allocation. The case study of the SGJ Construction demonstrates that this allocation model can accurately simulate work resumption and provide a sustainable allocation decisions and tools under pandemic.

This latter purpose is particularly important due to the high consequences and cost of delayed detection of a disease moving to a new population. Quantifying the sensitivity of early detection surveillance allows important aspects of the performance of different systems, approaches and authorities to be evaluated, compared and improved. While quantitative evaluation of the sensitivity of other branches of surveillance has been available for many years, development has lagged in the area of early detection, arguably one of the most important purposes of surveillance. This paper, using mostly animal health examples, develops a simple approach to quantifying the sensitivity of early detection surveillance, in terms of population coverage, temporal coverage and detection sensitivity. This approach is extended to quantify the benefits of risk-based approaches to early detection surveillance. Population-based clinical surveillance (based on either farmers and their veterinarians, or patients and their local health services) provides the best combination of sensitivity, practicality and cost-effectiveness. These systems can be significantly enhanced by removing disincentives to reporting, for instance by implementing effective strategies to improve farmer awareness and engagement with health services and addressing the challenges of well-intentioned disease notification policies that inadvertently impose barriers to reporting.","Cameron, A R; Meyer, A; Faverjon, C; Mackenzie, C",Transbound. emerg. dis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A single-center, retrospective study of a prospectively maintained database was performed. In total, 138 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. Baseline chest CT scan was performed in all patients. CT-based automated and semi-automated lung segmentation was performed using the Alma Medical workstation to calculate normal lung volume, lung opacities volume, total lung volume, and RLV. The primary end point of the study was mortality. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine independent predictors of mortality. RESULTS: Overall, 84 men (61%) and 54 women (39%) with a mean age of 47.3 years (±14.3 y) were included in the study. Overall mortality rate was 21% (29 patients) at a median time of 7 days (interquartile range, 4 to 11 d). Univariate analysis demonstrated that age, hypertension, and diabetes were associated with death (P<0.01). Similarly, patients who died had lower normal lung volume and RLV than patients who survived (P<0.01). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that low RLV was the only independent predictor of death (odds ratio, 1.042; 95% confidence interval, 10.2-10.65). Furthermore, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated that a RLV &#8804;64% significantly increased the risk of death (odds ratio, 4.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.9-11.7). CONCLUSION: Overall mortality of patients with COVID-19 may reach 21%. Univariate and multivariate analyses demonstrated that reduced RLV was the principal independent predictor of death.

To simplify the analysis we divide the outcomes in only two categories, that we call {best and worst scenarios.

We report here a case of severe COVID-19 that never had a positive PCR test result during disease progression but was confirmed with antibody test post recovery. This patient was self-quarantined and received diammonium glycyrrhizinate (DG), a steroid-like molecule, in combination with vitamin C as alternative medicine. This patient went through severe COVID-19 but eventually recovered upon the implementation of this treatment regimen, suggesting potential therapeutic effects of DG as alternative medicine to help relieve COVID-19 symptoms.","Ding, Hong; Deng, Wenjun; Ding, Lingling; Ye, Xiaoqun; Yin, Shanye; Huang, Weishan",J. med. virol,122,1

Such outcomes include low mood, suicide, and post-traumatic stress symptoms. Studies have mostly looked at the mental health of general citizens, healthcare workers, or infected survivors, with limited research targeting university students. This study aimed to understand the psychological distress experienced by self-quarantined undergraduate university students in Lebanon during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: Undergraduate students enrolled at the American University of Beirut were invited to participate in a 47-item online questionnaire. 73 participants completed the questionnaire. Demographic data, data about COVID-19 exposure, stressors during quarantine, understanding the rationale, compliance, and difficulties associated with quarantine, and levels of psychological distress were analysed. RESULTS: 75.3% of the participants were considered as having a high risk of developing acute stress. Undergoing quarantine for more than 14 days, having a chronic medical illness, inadequate access to supplies, and fear of infection were all significantly associated with an increased risk of acute stress. CONCLUSION: Despite being a necessary preventive measure during infectious disease outbreaks, quarantine can be associated with negative psychological effects, particularly in undergraduate students. Providing preventive and effective interventions is of utmost necessity.KEY POINTSDuring COVID-19, three-quarter of students had high risk for acute stress.Females had higher odds of high-risk acute stress compared to males.Having a chronic medical condition was associated with high risk acute stress.Long quarantine and lack of supplies were associated with high risk acute stress.Providing interventions to protect the mental health of students is necessary.","Kassir, Ghida; El Hayek, Samer; Zalzale, Hussein; Orsolini, Laura; Bizri, Maya",Int J Psychiatry Clin Pract,122,1

To document the use bats make of this cave and its importance as a refuge for migratory populations, we observed, sampled, banded, and released bats monthly for 26 months in 2005-2008 to 1) estimate population size and fluctuations using counts at emergence time and mark-recapture data, and 2) determine sex ratio, relative age, and reproductive condition of random samples of 100 individuals. The cave is occupied year-round by T. brasiliensis, with population size ranging from at least 2,524 bats in March to at least 19,360 in September. Sex ratio, age structure, and reproductive condition suggest that the cave is used by two discrete groups of free-tailed bats; one that resides year-round in the cave and another (mostly females) that uses it as a transient roost in spring and autumn. Evidence of two migratory groups occupying the same roost at least part of the year points to the existence of a complex system of interactions among migratory populations.","Lopéz-González, Celia; Rascón, Jorge; Daniel Hernández-Velázquez, Francisco",Chiropt. neotrop.,122,29

Results: In 353 patients, COVID-19 affected all age groups, mainly those aged 16–49 years, followed by those aged 50–64 years;82.43% were male;68% of infected patients were asymptomatic at presentation and were incidentally positive on contact tracing. Among symptomatic cases, fever (88%) was the most common symptom;of 14 severe COVID-19 patients with pneumonia, 8 died. Leukopenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and abnormal liver function tests were common lab findings. Thirty patients had radiographic evidence of pneumonia. The most common complications were acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, and kidney injury. The case fatality rate was 0.02%, and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score&gt;6 was a surrogate marker for admittance to the intensive care unit.

When a new virus emerges, generally, little is known about it, and no vaccines or other pharmaceutical interventions are available. In the case of a person-to-person transmission virus with no vaccines or other pharmaceutical interventions, the only way to control the virus outbreak is by keeping a sustained physical distancing between the individuals. However, to adjust the level of the physical distancing accurately can be so complicated. Any level above the necessary can compromise the economic activity, and any level below can collapse the health care system. This work proposes a controller to keep the number of hospitalized individuals below a limit, and a new group-structured model to describe the COVID-19 outbreak. The proposed controller is robust to the uncertainties in the parameters of the model and keeps the number of infected individuals controlled only by adjusting the social distancing level.

These people are more likely to be influenced by Covid-19 disinformation and lose their trust in government. As one of the first countries suffered from Covid-19, China has been faced with this serious ""infodemic"". In this context, government agencies in China adopted the four-stages strategies (immediate response, diagnosis, reforming interventions and evaluation) on social media to weaken the impact of disinformation and repair public trust. Based on the structural equation model (SEM), this study constructs a research model to statistically test the roles of the four-stages strategies on public trust repair in China. The findings reveal that each media strategy shows positive impact on citizens' perception of their government. From the lesson in China, it is suggested that government agencies need constantly cooperate with a wide range of social organizations to ensure the greater voice on social media. Also, it is necessary to regularize the four-stage strategies on social media as a whole system to mitigate the spread of disinformation and improve public attitudes toward government.","Zhu, Y.

The deficit of intensive care unit beds and ventilators in countries like Peru is forcing practitioners to seek preventive or early interventional strategies to prevent saturating these chronically neglected facilities. CASE PRESENTATION: A 64-year-old patient is reported after presenting with COVID-19 pneumonia and rapidly progressing to deteriorated ventilatory function. Compassionate treatment with a single 1­Gy dose to the bilateral whole-lung volume was administered, with gradual daily improvement of ventilatory function and decrease in serum inflammatory markers and oxygen support needs, including intubation. No treatment-related toxicity developed. Procedures of transport, disinfection, and treatment planning and delivery are described. CONCLUSION: Whole-lung low-dose radiotherapy seems to be a promising approach for avoiding or delaying invasive respiratory support. Delivered low doses are far from meeting toxicity ranges. On-going prospective trials will elucidate the effectiveness of this approach.","Del Castillo, Ruben; Martinez, David; Sarria, Gustavo J; Pinillos, Luis; Garcia, Bertha; Castillo, Luis; Carhuactocto, Alicia; Giordano, Frank A; Sarria, Gustavo R",Strahlenther Onkol,122,30

Amid the global public health threats posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, active cooperative governance has gradually emerged as the most powerful weapon against its spread. To facilitate international cooperation for pandemic governance, this paper applied the evolutionary game theory to analyze the factors influencing active cooperative governance and, based on the results, proposed a series of recommendations for promoting international cooperation. (1) leveraging the role of international organizations to reduce the cost of realizing the strategy of active cooperative governance, (2) promoting the international exchange of related experiences to lower the cost of active pandemic governance, (3) sustaining productive and daily activities during the pandemic in a classified and hierarchical manner to reduce the economic loss incurred by active pandemic governance, and (4) optimizing the incentive measures of international organizations to facilitate the selection of active cooperative governance. Finally, from the four aspects of resource management of pandemic treatment, supply management of living materials, population flow cooperation management, and governance fund cooperation management, this paper gives the path of international pandemic cooperative governance.","Lin, Xueyu; Yang, Hualei; Wu, Yuanyang; Zheng, Xiaodong; Xie, Lin; Shen, Zheng; Hu, Sen",Front Public Health,122,1

Lessons learned, mistakes made, and thoughts on the future of online education in nursing are discussed. METHOD: During the online transition, it was thought the flipped-classroom approach would transition well using the same design thinking methodology taught in the course. Because the course promoted rapid innovation and iteration, such a challenge served as a call to action, and the course became a valuable real-time case study. RESULTS: Based on student surveys, the overall quality of the transitioned course increased slightly compared with the previous semester's in-person course, indicating schools of nursing can innovate both the way students are taught as well as what students are taught.

Endoscopic endonasal skull base surgery (ESBS) is thought to be among the highest risk aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) for surgeons and operating room personnel. Objective: To validate the efficacy and clinical feasibility of a novel surgical device. Methods: A low-cost, modifiable, and easily producible negative pressure, face-mounted antechamber was developedutilizing 3D printing and silicone molding. Efficacy was evaluated using an optical particle sizer (OPS) to quantify aerosolsgenerated during both cadaver and intraoperative human use with high-speed drilling. Results: Particle counts in the cadaver showed that drilling led to a 2.49-fold increase in particles ≤5 μm ( p = 0.001), andthat the chamber was effective at reducing particles to levels not significantly different than baseline. In humans, drillingled to a 37-fold increase in in particles ≤5 μm ( p &lt; 0.001), and the chamber was effective at reducing particles to a level notsignificantly different than baseline. Use of the antechamber in 6 complex cases did not interfere with the ability to performsurgery. Patients did not report any facial discomfort after surgery related to antechamber use. Conclusions: The use of a negative pressure facial antechamber can effectively reduce aerosolization from endoscopicdrilling without disturbing the flow of the operation. The antechamber, in conjunction with appropriate PPE, will be usefulduring the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as during flu season and any future viral outbreaks.","Kim, M.; Lee, M.; Schwarz, J.; Kacker, A.; Schwartz, T.

Zscan4 is transiently expressed during zygotic genome activation (ZGA) in preimplantation embryos and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) reprogramming. However, little is known about the mechanism of Zscan4 underlying these processes of cell fate control. Here, we show that Zscan4f, a representative of ZSCAN proteins, is able to recruit Tet2 through its SCAN domain. The Zscan4f-Tet2 interaction promotes DNA demethylation and regulates the expression of target genes, particularly those encoding glycolytic enzymes and proteasome subunits. Zscan4f regulates metabolic rewiring, enhances proteasome function, and ultimately promotes iPSC generation. These results identify Zscan4f as an important partner of Tet2 in regulating target genes and promoting iPSC generation and suggest a possible and common mechanism shared by SCAN family transcription factors to recruit ten-eleven translocation (TET) DNA dioxygenases to regulate diverse cellular processes, including reprogramming.","Cheng, Zhou-Li; Zhang, Meng-Li; Lin, Huai-Peng; Gao, Chao; Song, Jun-Bin; Zheng, Zhihong; Li, Linpeng; Zhang, Yanan; Shen, Xiaoqi; Zhang, Hao; Huang, Zhenghui; Zhan, Wuqiang; Zhang, Cheng; Hu, Xu; Sun, Yi-Ping; Jiang, Lubing; Sun, Lei; Xu, Yanhui; Yang, Chen; Ge, Yuanlong; Zhao, Yong; Liu, Xingguo; Yang, Hui; Liu, Pengyuan; Guo, Xing; Guan, Kun-Liang; Xiong, Yue; Zhang, Mingliang; Ye, Dan",Cell Rep,122,24

Based on its phylogenetic relationships and genomic structures the COVID-19 belongs to genera Betacoronavirus. Human Betacoronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV) have many similarities, but also have differences in their genomic and phenotypic structure that can influence their pathogenesis. COVID-19 is containing single-stranded (positive-sense) RNA associated with a nucleoprotein within a capsid comprised of matrix protein. A typical CoV contains at least six ORFs in its genome. All the structural and accessory proteins are translated from the sgRNAs of CoVs. Four main structural proteins are encoded by ORFs 10, 11 on the one-third of the genome near the 3'-terminus. The genetic and phenotypic structure of COVID-19 in pathogenesis is important.

The aim of this study was the synthesis and evaluation of in vitro anti-HIV-1 activity for phosphate derivatives of 3-carboxyacylbetulin 3-5 as well as an in silico study of new compounds as potential ligands of the C-terminal domain of the HIV-1 capsid-spacer peptide 1 (CA-CTD-SP1) as a molecular target of HIV-1 maturation inhibitors. In vitro studies showed that 28-diethoxyphosphoryl-3-O-(3',3'-dimethylsuccinyl)betulin (compound 3), the phosphate analog of bevirimat (betulinic acid derivative, HIV-1 maturation inhibitor), has IC50 (half maximal inhibitory concentration) equal to 0.02 µM. Compound 3 inhibits viral replication at a level comparable to bevirimat and is also more selective (selectivity indices = 1250 and 967, respectively). Molecular docking was used to examine the probable interaction between the phosphate derivatives of 3-carboxyacylbetulin and C-terminal domain (CTD) of the HIV-1 capsid (CA)-spacer peptide 1 (SP1) fragment of Gag protein, designated as CTD-SP1. Compared with interactions between bevirimat (BVM) and the protein, an increased number of strong interactions between ligand 3 and the protein, generated by the phosphate group, were observed. These compounds might have the potential to also inhibit SARS-CoV2 proteins, in as far as the intrinsically imprecise docking scores suggest.","Marciniec, Krzysztof; Chrobak, Elwira; Dabrowska, Aleksandra; Bebenek, Ewa; Kadela-Tomanek, Monika; Pecak, Pawel; Boryczka, Stanislaw",Biomolecules,122,3

En août 2020, le retour d’expérience de la 1ere vague nous a conduit à l’acquisition d’appareils d’oxygénothérapie haut débit (OHD) pour certains services non habitués à leur usage comme celui des maladies infectieuses (MI). Dans ce contexte, la pratique de l’OHD en service d’hospitalisation conventionnelle (HC) s’est imposée comme alternative dans la prise en charge des patients ayant une pneumopathie grave à SARS-CoV-2 en attente de lit ou récusés de réanimation. Matériels et méthodes Nous présentons une analyse descriptive rétrospective de 32 patients qui ont bénéficié d’une OHD dans le cadre d’une aggravation de leur pneumopathie hypoxémiante à SARS-CoV-2 dans le service de MI d’un centre hospitalier général entre le 20/08/2020 et 15/02/2021. L’objectif de cette étude était d’étudier la mortalité en HC des patients ayant bénéficié d’OHD. Résultats Des 32 patients mis sous OHD en HC, 18 (56 %) étaient éligibles à la réanimation. Treize sur 18 (72,2%) ont pu être transférés en réanimation dans un délai de 24h après la mise en place de l’OHD (3jours pour une patiente). Cinq (27,8 %) patients sont restés en HC avec une durée moyenne d’OHD de 3jours et une durée moyenne d’hospitalisation de 12jours. Il n’y a pas eu de décès chez ces patients. Quatorze patients (44 %) n’avaient pas d’indication à un transfert en réanimation pour critère d’âge (&gt;80 ans). Le sex-ratio était de 1/1, leur moyenne d’âge de 86 ans (80–94 ans). La durée d’hospitalisation moyenne était de 15jours (3–39jours) et la durée moyenne d’OHD de 5jours (1–15jours). Le taux de mortalité en HC des personnes récusées de réanimation sous OHD était de 71 %. Conclusion La pratique de l’OHD en HC a permis d’éviter 5 transferts en réanimation sur 18 patients graves éligibles aux soins continus avec une évolution favorable pour tous. Quant aux personnes de plus de 80 ans, non éligibles à la réanimation, la mortalité restait très élevée (71 %). Le taux de mortalité suite à la COVID en population gériatrique varie entre 11 et 44 % selon les études quel que soit le tableau clinique. Le taux de mortalité des patients de plus de 80 ans avec des signes de gravité reste très élevé mais n’est pas clairement établi. L’OHD ne semble pas avoir d’effet sur la mortalité dans cette catégorie de patients, mais l’impact sur le confort des patients reste à évaluer.","Badr, C.; Jaafar, D.; Bounhiol, A.; Medina, F.; Georger, J.; Caraux-Paz, P.",Infectious Diseases Now,122,1

Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is a promising strategy to detect pathogens and may serve as an early-warning system for disease outbreaks. Notably, WBE has garnered substantial interest during the COVID-19 pandemic to track disease burden through analyses of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Throughout the COVID-19 outbreak, tracking SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater has been an important tool for understanding the spread of the virus. Unlike traditional sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from clinical samples, which adds testing burden to the healthcare system, in this study, metatranscriptomics was used to sequence virus directly from wastewater. Here, we present a study in which we explored RNA viral diversity through sequencing 94 wastewater influent samples across seven treatment plants (WTPs), collected August 2020 - January 2021, representing approximately 16 million people in Southern California. Enriched viral libraries identified a wide diversity of RNA viruses that differed between WTPs and over time, with detected viruses including coronaviruses, influenza A, and noroviruses. Furthermore, single nucleotide variants (SNVs) of SARS-CoV-2 were identified in wastewater and we measured proportions of overall virus and SNVs across several months. We detected several SNVs that are markers for clinically-important SARS-CoV-2 variants, along with SNVs of unknown function, prevalence, or epidemiological consequence. Our study shows the potential of WBE to detect viruses in wastewater and to track the diversity and spread of viral variants in urban and suburban locations, which may aid public health efforts to monitor disease outbreaks. ImportanceWastewater based epidemiology (WBE) can detect pathogens across sewersheds, which represents the collective waste of human populations. As there is a wide diversity of RNA viruses in wastewater, monitoring the presence of these viruses is useful for public health, industry, and ecological studies. Specific to public health, WBE has proven valuable during the COVID-19 pandemic to track the spread of SARS-CoV-2 without adding burden to healthcare systems. In this study, we used metatranscriptomics and RT-ddPCR to assay RNA viruses across Southern California wastewater from August 2020 - January 2021, representing approximately 16 million people from Los Angeles, Orange, and San Diego counties. We found that SARS-CoV-2 quantification in wastewater correlates well with county-wide COVID-19 case data, and that we can detect SARS-CoV-2 single nucleotide variants through sequencing. Likewise, WTPs harbored different viromes, and we detected other human pathogens such as noroviruses and adenoviruses, furthering our understanding of wastewater viral ecology.","Rothman, Jason A; Loveless, Theresa B; Kapcia, Joseph; Adams, Eric D; Steele, Joshua A; Zimmer-Faust, Amity G; Langlois, Kylie; Wanless, David; Griffith, Madison; Mao, Lucy; Chokry, Jeffrey; Griffith, John F; Whiteson, Katrine L",,122,15

Perioperative protocols are needed to streamline care for these patients notwithstanding capacity and resource constraints. METHODS: A multidisciplinary panel was assembled at the University of California, San Francisco, with 26 leaders across 10 academic departments, including 7 department chairpersons, the chief medical officer, the chief operating officer, infection control officers, nursing leaders, and resident house staff champions. An epidemiologist, an ethicist, and a statistician were also consulted. A modified two-round, blinded Delphi method based on 18 agree/disagree statements was used to build consensus. Significant disagreement for each statement was tested using a one-sided exact binomial test against an expected outcome of 95% consensus using a significance threshold of p < 0.05. Final triage protocols were developed with unblinded group-level discussion. RESULTS: Overall, 15 of 18 statements achieved consensus in the first round of the Delphi method; the 3 statements with significant disagreement (p < 0.01) were modified and iteratively resubmitted to the expert panel to achieve consensus. Consensus-based protocols were developed using unblinded multidisciplinary panel discussions. The final algorithms 1) quantified outbreak level, 2) triaged patients based on acuity, 3) provided a checklist for urgent/emergent invasive procedures, and 4) created a novel scoring system for the allocation of personal protective equipment. In particular, the authors modified the American College of Surgeons three-tiered triage system to incorporate more urgent cases, as are often encountered in neurosurgery and spine surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Urgent and emergent invasive procedures need to be performed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Yet, after decades of research on the occurrence and the toxicity of Alternaria toxins in academia, no regulation has been implemented yet, thus leaving these potential food contaminants in the status of so-called ""emerging mycotoxins"". However, research on this topic has been far from static, leading to the European Food Safety Authority repeatedly calling for more data on the occurrence and toxicity of genotoxic metabolites such as alternariol (AOH) and its monomethyl ether (AME). To give an overview on recent developments in the field, this comprehensive review summarizes published data and addresses current challenges arising from the chemical complexity of Alternaria's metabolome, mixture effects and the emergence of novel biological targets like cell membranes or the interaction with different receptors. Besides toxicodynamics, we review recent research on toxicokinetics, including the first in vivo studies which incorporated the rarely investigated-but highly genotoxic-perylene quinones. Furthermore, a particular focus lies on the advances of liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based analytical tools for determining a broader spectrum of Alternaria toxins including modified/masked forms and assessing exposure via human biomonitoring (HBM).","Aichinger, Georg; Del Favero, Giorgia; Warth, Benedikt; Marko, Doris",,122,20

We aimed to investigate if frontline healthcare workers affected by infodemia show different psychological consequences than frontline clinicians who do not declare to be affected by false news related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods: One hundred twenty-six frontline healthcare workers from the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and Emergency Departments in Romania completed a survey to assess stress, depression, anxiety, and sleep disorders, between March and April 2020. We split the sample of frontline healthcare workers into two groups based on the self-evaluated criteria: if they were or were not affected by infodemia in their activity. Results: Considering limitations such as the cross-sectional design, the lack of causality relationship, and the sample size, the results show that, the frontline medical workers who declared to be affected by false news were significantly more stressed, felt more anxiety, and suffered more from insomnia than healthcare workers who are not affected by false information related to pandemic time. Conclusions: The infodemia has significant psychological consequences such as stress, anxiety, and insomnia on already overwhelmed doctors and nurses in the outbreak of the COVID-19 crisis. These findings suggest that medical misinformation's psychological implications must be considered when different interventions regarding frontline healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic are implemented.","Secosan, Ica; Virga, Delia; Crainiceanu, Zorin Petrisor; Bratu, Lavinia Melania; Bratu, Tiberiu",Medicina (Kaunas),122,11

The current novel coronavirus, COVID-19, has reduced face-to-face contact, and this has challenged how health professionals and clinical students can access training, accreditation and development. Online and other remote mechanisms are available to tutors and course designers; however, they might not feel comfortable with such affordances, in light of expectations to so rapidly change familiar teaching and delivery styles. This may result in the loss of interaction and disruption of peer learning, which are hallmarks of the small group tutorial. Collaborative learning is essential to develop and refine an emerging sense of belonging to a professional community through formal studies, and interactive learning is a requirement for some registered health professions to satisfy ongoing professional accreditation. Online media has been used to promote social learning in regional, rural and remote communities for some time. Strategies for learning activity design and tutor training are proposed to equip course designers and educators to support health professions education remotely, through the synchronous, online small group.

This study aimed to evaluate different aspects of TB learning amongst undergraduate dental students during the pandemic outbreak of COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dental students in selected Iraqi universities (University of Baghdad, University of Sulaimani and Dijlah University College) were invited to join the study. A questionnaire was created using a Google platform and answered by students. Satisfaction and attitude towards TB learning plus total evaluation scores for lecturers were examined. RESULTS: A total of 832 out of 1800 dental students participated in the study. The majority of participants have basic (40.7%) and intermediate (47.5%) computer skills, and more than half of them lack any experience in TB learning. The overall satisfaction and positive attitude towards TB learning were less than 50%. Students at final grade, with advanced computer skills and TB learning experience, showed higher satisfaction (OR: 3.031, 2.876, 3.644, respectively) and a more positive attitude (OR: 3.172, 3.035, 3.477, respectively) towards TB learning than those at earlier grades. Total evaluation scores for lecturers were higher amongst females (11.5 ± 5.8) than males (9.9 ± 7.2) as well as amongst participants at final grade (14.0 ± 6.2), with advanced computer skills (13.8 ± 6.1) and TB learning experience (16.2 ± 6.0). CONCLUSIONS: Dental students demonstrated low-moderate satisfaction and positive attitude towards TB learning and the quality of material presented to them.

We sought to determine clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 managed with invasive mechanical ventilation in an appropriately resourced US health care system. METHODS: Outcomes of COVID-19 infected patients requiring mechanical ventilation treated within the Inova Health System between March 5, 2020 and April 26, 2020 were evaluated through an electronic medical record review. RESULTS: 1023 COVID-19 positive patients were admitted to the Inova Health System during the study period. Of these, 164 (16.0%) were managed with invasive mechanical ventilation. All patients were followed to definitive disposition. 70/164 patients (42.7%) had died and 94/164 (57.3%) were still alive. Deceased patients were older (median age of 66 vs. 55, p <0.0001) and had a higher initial d-dimer (2.22 vs. 1.31, p = 0.005) and peak ferritin levels (2998 vs. 2077, p = 0.016) compared to survivors. 84.3% of patients over 70 years old died in the hospital. Conversely, 67.4% of patients age 70 or younger survived to hospital discharge. Younger age, non-Caucasian race and treatment at a tertiary care center were all associated with survivor status. CONCLUSION: Mortality of patients with COVID-19 requiring invasive mechanical ventilation is high, with particularly daunting mortality seen in patients of advanced age, even in a well-resourced health care system. A substantial proportion of patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation were not of advanced age, and this group had a reasonable chance for recovery.","King, Christopher S; Sahjwani, Dhwani; Brown, A Whitney; Feroz, Saad; Cameron, Paula; Osborn, Erik; Desai, Mehul; Djurkovic, Svetolik; Kasarabada, Aditya; Hinerman, Rachel; Lantry, James; Shlobin, Oksana A; Ahmad, Kareem; Khangoora, Vikramjit; Aryal, Shambhu; Collins, A Claire; Speir, Alan; Nathan, Steven",PLoS One,122,1

Traditional family-based care, which has been the basis of most care for older people, is becoming unsustainable as families become smaller. In addition, women tend to be adversely affected as they still form the bulk of caregivers for older people, and many are likely to exit the labor market in order to provide care. Many family caregivers also have no or minimal training, and they may be called upon to provide quite complex care, increasing the proportion of older people receiving suboptimal care if they rely only on informal care that is provided by families and friends. Facing the increasing burden of noncommunicable diseases and age-related morbidity, Thai communities are increasingly in need of community-integrated care models for older persons that can link existing health systems and reduce the burden upon caring families. This need is common to many countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to assess the effectiveness of a community-integrated intermediary care (CIIC) model to enhance family-based care for older people. METHODS: This paper describes a cluster randomized controlled trial comprised of 6 intervention clusters and 6 control clusters that aim to recruit 2000 participants in each arm. This research protocol has been approved by the World Health Organization Ethics Review Committee. The intervention clusters will receive an integrated model of care structured around (1) a community respite service, (2) the strengthening of family care capacity, and (3) an exercise program that aims to prevent entry into long-term care for older people. Control group clusters receive usual care (ie, the current system of long-term care common to all provinces in Thailand), consisting principally of a volunteer-assisted home care service. The trial will be conducted over a period of 2 years. The primary outcome is family caregiver burden measured at a 6-month follow-up, as measured by the Caregiver Burden Inventory. Secondary outcomes consist of biopsychosocial indicators including functional ability, as measured using an activity of daily living scale; depression, as measured by the Geriatric Depression Scale; and quality of life of older people, as measured by the EuroQol 5-dimensions 5-levels scale. Intention-to-treat analysis will be followed. RESULTS: The CIIC facility has been established. Community care prevention programs have been launched at the intervention clusters. Family caregivers are receiving training and assistance. However, the COVID-19 pandemic delayed the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Since ASEAN and many Asian countries share similar traditional family-based, long-term care systems, the proposed CIIC model and the protocol for its implementation and evaluation may benefit other countries wishing to adopt similar community-integrated care models for older people at risk of needing long-term care.

Nevertheless, multiple pharmacological effects of the drug have been revealed in several investigations. Conceivably, the immunomodulatory properties of azithromycin are among its critical features, leading to its application in treating inflammatory diseases, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Additionally, azithromycin may directly inhibit viral load as well as its replication, or it could demonstrate indirect inhibitory impacts that might be associated with the expression of antiviral genes. Currently, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an extra urgent issue affecting the entire world, and it is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Emerging evidence suggests that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an important role in VC. However, the role of SNHG29 is less clear. METHODS: The expression of SNHG29, miR-200b-3p, &#945;-Klotho, FGFR1 and FGF23 in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) was quantified by qRT-PCR and western blot assays. ß-GP was used to construct an in vitro calcification model, followed by MTT assay to detect cell viability. Calcification was determined by alizarin red S staining and quantified by calcification assay. ALP activity was investigated by ALP staining. The interactions among SNHG29, miR-200b-3p and &#945;-Klotho were verified by luciferase assay. RESULTS: In the in vitro calcification model, SNHG29 was downregulated, while miR-200b-3p was upregulated. SNHG29 overexpression and miR-200b-3p knockdown significantly suppressed osteoblast-related factors (RUNX2 and BMP2), accompanied by activation of the &#945;-Klotho/FGFR1/FGF23 axis, further inhibiting the formation of calcified nodules. Moreover, miR-200b-3p overexpression and &#945;-Klotho knockdown reversed the SNHG29 overexpression-induced inhibitory effects on calcified VSMCs. CONCLUSION: Our study is the first to demonstrate that SNHG29 could inhibit VSMC calcification by downregulating miR-200b-3p to activate the &#945;-Klotho/FGFR1/FGF23 axis, suggesting SNHG29 as a novel therapeutic target for VC-associated diseases.","Huang, Chong; Zhan, Jin-Feng; Chen, Yan-Xia; Xu, Cheng-Yun; Chen, Yan",Cytokine,122,26

Currently, anoplin (GLLKRIKTLL-NH2) is a natural antimicrobial candidate derived from wasp venom. In this study, a series of new antimicrobial peptide (AMP) anoplin analogues were designed and synthesized. The relationship between their biological activities and their positive charge, hydrophobicity, amphipathicity, and secondary structure are described. The characteristic shared by these peptides is that positively charged amino acids and hydrophobic amino acids are severally arranged on the hydrophilic and hydrophobic surface of the &#945;-helix to form a completely amphiphilic structure. To achieve ideal AMPs, below the range of the threshold of the cytotoxicity and hemolytic activity, their charges and hydrophobicity were increased as much. Among the new analogues, A-21 (KWWKKWKKWW-NH2) exhibited the greatest antimicrobial activity (geometric mean of minimum inhibitory concentrations = 4.76 µM) against all the tested bacterial strains, high bacterial cell selectivity in vitro, high effectiveness against bacterial pneumonia in mice infected with Klebsiella pneumoniae, and low toxicity in mice (LD50 = 82.01 mg/kg). A-21 exhibited a potent bacterial membrane-damaging mechanism and lipopolysaccharide-binding ability. These data provide evidence that A-21 is a promising antimicrobial candidate for the treatment of bacterial pneumonia.","Gou, Sanhu; Li, Beibei; Ouyang, Xu; Ba, Zufang; Zhong, Chao; Zhang, Tianyue; Chang, LinLin; Zhu, Yuewen; Zhang, Jingying; Zhu, Ningyi; Zhang, Yun; Liu, Hui; Ni, Jingman",J. med. chem,122,33

METHODOLOGY: This descriptive and cross-sectional study was conducted on 87 confirmed COVID-19 patients. The patients were separated into two groups according to the admission in the ICU or in the ward. MIF was determined batchwise in plasma obtained as soon as the patients were admitted. Both groups were compared with respect to demographic characteristics, biochemical parameters and prediction of requirement to ICU admission. RESULTS: Forty seven patients in ICU, and 40 patients in ward were included. With respect to MIF levels and biochemical biomarkers, there was a statistically significant difference between the ICU and ward patients (p< 0.024). In terms of ICU requirement, the cut-off value of MIF was detected as 4.705 (AUC:0.633, 95%CI:0.561-0.79, p= 0.037), D-dimer was 789 (AUC:0.779, 95%CI: 0.681-0.877, p= 0.000), troponin was 8.15 (AUC: 0.820, 95%CI:0.729-0.911, p= 0.000), ferritin was 375 (AUC: 0.774, 95%CI:0.671-0.876, p= 0.000), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was 359.5 (AUC:0.843, 95%CI: 0.753-0.933, p= 0.000). According to the logistic regression analysis; when MIF level > 4.705, the patient's requirement to ICU risk was increased to 8.33 (95%CI: 1.73-44.26, p= 0.009) fold. Similarly, elevation of troponin, ferritin and, LDH was shown to predict disease prognosis (p< 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that MIF may play a role in inflammatory responses to COVID-19 through induction of pulmonary inflammatory cytokines, suggesting that pharmacotherapeutic approaches targeting MIF may hold promise for the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia.","Dheir, Hamad; Yaylaci, Selcuk; Sipahi, Savas; Genc, Ahmed Cihad; Cekic, Deniz; Tuncer, Fatma Betul; Cokluk, Erdem; Kocayigit, Havva; Genc, Ahmed Bilal; Salihi, Salih; Varim, Ceyhun; Karabay, Oguz",J Infect Dev Ctries,122,1

DESIGN: Case series of consecutive veterans with SCI treated at a single center. SETTING: SCI Unit at an urban Veterans Administration hospital at the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US. PARTICIPANTS: Seven SCI veterans with confirmed COVID-19 infection by PCR; all veterans were male, mean age was 60.6. Five had cervical level of injury, and five had complete injury (AIS A). Six veterans had a BMI > 22; three had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; three had chronic kidney disease. INTERVENTIONS: None. OUTCOME MEASURES: Presence of co-morbidities, diagnostic values, and clinical findings. RESULTS: Each case presented differently; the most common presenting sign was fever. In the three individuals with critical and fatal infection, pre-existing comorbidities were more common and inflammatory markers were markedly elevated. CONCLUSION: Level and completeness of SCI did not appear to correlate with COVID-19 severity, as mild and asymptomatic illness was noted in persons with high grade SCI. As has been shown to be the case in the general population, pre-existing comorbidities are the most reliable predictors of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection currently available for persons with chronic SCI. Contrary to concerns that SCI may mask the cardinal signs of COVID-19, such as fever and cough, by way of compromised thermoregulation and thoracoabdominal musculature, such signs were common in our series. To facilitate early detection, prompt treatment, and minimized viral spread, the implementation of preventive strategies by SCI units is recommended.","Galea, Marinella D; Gelman, Michael A; Galea, Vincent P; Raulkar, Krutika Parasar; Kornfeld, Stephen; Johnson-Kunjukutty, Swapna; Li, Gang; Bräu, Norbert",J Spinal Cord Med,122,22

The aim of this manuscript is to provide practical suggestions for the management of the most common endocrinological conditions during ongoing COVID-19/SARS-CoV2 pandemic. We have conducted a literature review and present our own experience of treating endocrinology patients during the months of full COVID-19 lockdown and then phased partial reopening. The results of the literature review have demonstrated the utmost importance of excelling in a challenging task of maintaining the best possible control of such endocrinological conditions as diabetes mellitus and adrenal insufficiency, while also maintaining the universal social distancing and isolation. In the patients with diabetes mellitus Hemoglobin A1C level correlates with the risk of unfavorable outcomes of COVID-19 which makes optimization of diabetes mellitus control an even more significant during the pandemic. It is important to provide the patients with the specific instructions on self-titration of insulin and on the use of non-insulin antidiabetic medications, examples of which are shown in the manuscript. For the patients with adrenal insufficiency, it is essential to discuss the rules of dose increase of the glucocorticosteroids in case of development of COVID-19 or any other acute illness. The diagnosis and management of other endocrinological conditions as for example thyroid nodules and osteoporosis (with the exclusion of secondary osteoporosis associated with diseases requiring timely treatment) can be delayed for the sake of everybody's safety and partially also for prioritization of healthcare recourses utilization during these uneasy times.

However, previous reports indicate that practicing within this expanded scope has remained limited. Therefore, a 26-item, web-based survey was emailed to CA community pharmacists to assess pharmacists' knowledge, intent, and barriers to prescribing and billing for these patient care services. A total of 216 chain, supermarket-based, independent, mass merchant, and health-system outpatient pharmacists were included. The primary services provided and medications prescribed are for vaccinations and naloxone. Most pharmacists agree that engagement in and implementation of new strategies to enhance patients' access to care is important. Common barriers include patient unawareness of pharmacist-provided services, lack of payment for services, and difficulty incorporating services within pharmacy workflow. Pharmacists are confident in their ability to provide patient care services but are less knowledgeable and confident about billing for them. Enhancing promotion of pharmacist-provided services to patients, developing strategies to efficiently incorporate them into the workflow, and payment models can help overcome barriers to providing these services.","Reyes, Liesl D; Hong, Jenny; Lin, Christine; Hamper, Jeffrey; Kroon, Lisa",,122,5

Due to increasing COVID-19 cases, there is a dearth of testing kits. Therefore, there is a severe need for an automatic recognition system as a solution to reduce the spreading of the COVID-19 virus. This work offers a decision support system based on the X-ray image to diagnose the presence of the COVID-19 virus. A deep learning-based computer-aided decision support system will be capable to differentiate between COVID-19 and pneumonia. Recently, convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed for the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients through chest radiography (or chest X-ray, CXR) images. However, due to the usage of CNN, there are some limitations with these decision support systems. These systems suffer with the problem of view-invariance and loss of information due to down-sampling. In this paper, the capsule network (CapsNet)-based system named visual geometry group capsule network (VGG-CapsNet) for the diagnosis of COVID-19 is proposed. Due to the usage of capsule network (CapsNet), the authors have succeeded in removing the drawbacks found in the CNN-based decision support system for the detection of COVID-19. Through simulation results, it is found that VGG-CapsNet has performed better than the CNN-CapsNet model for the diagnosis of COVID-19. The proposed VGG-CapsNet-based system has shown 97% accuracy for COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 classification, and 92% accuracy for COVID-19 versus normal versus viral pneumonia classification. Proposed VGG-CapsNet-based system available at https://github.com/shamiktiwari/COVID19_Xray can be used to detect the existence of COVID-19 virus in the human body through chest radiographic images.","Tiwari, Shamik; Jain, Anurag",,122,16

Here, we used data collected from contact tracing during the lockdown in response to the first wave of COVID-19 in Punjab, a major state in India, to quantify this heterogeneity, and to examine implications for transmission dynamics. We found evidence of heterogeneity acting at multiple levels: in the number of potentially infectious contacts per index case, and in the per-contact risk of infection. Incorporating these findings in simple mathematical models of disease transmission reveals that these heterogeneities act in combination to strongly influence transmission dynamics. Standard approaches, such as representing heterogeneity through secondary case distributions, could be biased by neglecting these underlying interactions between heterogeneities. We discuss implications for policy, and for more efficient contact tracing in resource-constrained settings such as India. Our results highlight how contact tracing, an important public health measure, can also provide important insights into epidemic spread and control.","Arinaminpathy, Nimalan; Das, Jishnu; McCormick, Tyler H; Mukhopadhyay, Partha; Sircar, Neelanjan",Epidemics,122,6

Therefore, the discovery of drugs that can effectively prevent and treat COVID-19 is urgently warranted. In this article, the role and significance of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in drug development and the treatment of COVID-19 are discussed. It was found that the binding of ACE2 to SARS-CoV-2-RBD involved two core regions (31st and 353rd lysine) and 20 amino acids of the ACE2 protein. The mutation of these amino acids could lead to a great change of the binding ability of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2-RBD. This information was important for us to find more efficient ACE2 peptides to block the 2019-nCoV infection. So during this study, we summarized the role of ACE2 in the regulation of 2019-nCoV infection and stress, and hypothesized that the development and optimization of ACE2 peptide can effectively block 2019-nCoV infection and reliably treat the COVID-19.","Liu, Yang; He, Huanzhong; Huang, Huilian",J Clin Lab Anal,122,1

In a cohort of patients, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), beyond the classical respiratory manifestations, induces anosmia. Evidence has suggested SARS-CoV-2-induced anosmia can be the result of neurodegeneration of the olfactory pathway. Neurological symptoms associated with COVID-19 have been reported; however, the precise mechanism and possible long-lasting effects remain poorly investigated. Preclinical models are valuable tools for describing and testing new possible treatments for neurological disorders. In this way, the zebrafish (Danio rerio) organism model represents an attractive tool in the field of neuroscience, showing economic and logistical advantages besides genetic and physiologic similarities with mammalian, including the brain structure and functions. Besides, its external embryonic development, high availability of eggs, and fast development allows easy genetic manipulation and fast replications. In the present review, we suggest that the zebrafish model can be advantageous to investigate the neurological features of COVID-19.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe Coronavirus Disease - 2019 (COVID-19) is characterized not only by respiratory, but also neurological symptoms that may persevere even longer than the respiratory condition. However, some questions remain unanswered. How does the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) enter the brain? Which brain regions are infected? How does the virus affect our behavioral and sensorial responses? Can the brain infection induce alterations that last longer? We propose that the zebrafish is a suitable model to study the effects of SARS-CoV-2 in the brain, especially because of the similarities between the fish' and the human brain. Zebrafish is a cheap animal model and several reproducible and fast animal tests can be used to investigate its behavioral and sensory functions.","Costa, Karla C M; Brigante, Tamires A V; Fernandes, Gabriel G; Scomparin, Davi S; Scarante, Franciele F; de Oliveira, Danielle P; Campos, Alline C",ENeuro,122,16

In retrospective cohort studies, use of famotidine, a specific oral H2 receptor antagonist (antihistamine), has been associated with reduced risk of intubation and death in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. In a case series, nonhospitalized patients with COVID-19 experienced rapid symptom resolution after taking famotidine, but the molecular basis of these observations remains elusive. Here we show using biochemical, cellular, and functional assays that famotidine has no effect on viral replication or viral protease activity. However, famotidine can affect histamine-induced signaling processes in infected Caco2 cells. Specifically, famotidine treatment inhibits histamine-induced expression of Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells and can reduce TLR3-dependent signaling processes that culminate in activation of IRF3 and the NF-&#954;B pathway, subsequently controlling antiviral and inflammatory responses. SARS-CoV-2-infected cells treated with famotidine demonstrate reduced expression levels of the inflammatory mediators CCL-2 and IL6, drivers of the cytokine release syndrome that precipitates poor outcome for patients with COVID-19. Given that pharmacokinetic studies indicate that famotidine can reach concentrations in blood that suffice to antagonize histamine H2 receptors expressed in mast cells, neutrophils, and eosinophils, these observations explain how famotidine may contribute to the reduced histamine-induced inflammation and cytokine release, thereby improving the outcome for patients with COVID-19.","Mukherjee, Rukmini; Bhattacharya, Anshu; Bojkova, Denisa; Mehdipour, Ahmad Reza; Shin, Donghyuk; Khan, Khadija Shahed; Hei-Yin Cheung, Hayley; Wong, Kam-Bo; Ng, Wai-Lung; Cinatl, Jindrich; Geurink, Paul P; van der Heden van Noort, Gerbrand J; Rajalingam, Krishnaraj; Ciesek, Sandra; Hummer, Gerhard; Dikic, Ivan",J Biol Chem,122,30

DESIGN: Prospective cross-sectional observational study. SETTING: Single, large United Kingdom hospital. PATIENTS: Total of 113 patients undergoing abdominal surgery or instrumentation of the lower genital tract. INTERVENTIONS: We took COVID-19 swabs from the peritoneal cavity and from the vagina from all eligible patients. Results were stratified by preoperative COVID-19 status. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In patients who were presumed COVID-19 negative at the time of surgery, SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA was detected in 0 of 102 peritoneal samples and 0 of 98 vaginal samples. Both cohorts included 4 patients who were antibody positive but nasopharyngeal swab test negative at the time of surgery. Peritoneal and vaginal swabs were also negative in 1 patient who had a positive nasopharyngeal swab immediately before surgery. CONCLUSION: The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the abdominal fluid or lower genital tract of presumed negative patients is nil or extremely low. These data will inform surgeons of the risks of restarting laparoscopic surgery at a time when COVID-19 is endemic in the population.","Jones, Dominique; Faluyi, David; Hamilton, Sarah; Stylianides, Nicholas; Ma, Ken; Duff, Sarah; Machin, Nicholas; Edmondson, Richard J",J. minim. invasive gynecol,122,16

The treatment of choice in the majority of cases is laparoscopic appendectomy. In the era of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a concern for a delayed referral of patients and thus a more advanced presentation of the disease leading to a prolonged and complicated course. METHODS: Retrospective review of a computerized database of patients who were admitted with acute appendicitis and underwent laparoscopic appendectomy during the COVID pandemic in a single tertiary center in Israel. Patients were compared with those who were admitted and operated for appendicitis in the same period in the previous year. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-three patients underwent laparoscopic appendectomy in the study period in 2020, compared with 109 who had surgery in 2019. During the COVID pandemic 41 patients presented with complicated appendicitis versus 22 patients in 2019 (P=0.0174).

The aim of our study was to assess use and short-term outcomes of 2- and 3-stage IPAA in older adults. METHODS: The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database was searched for &#8805; 65-year-old patients who underwent IPAA for UC in 2- or 3-stage from 2012 to 2016. The primary endpoint was the rate and trends of the two approaches over time. Secondary endpoints included 30-day adverse events and complication-associated costs. RESULTS: Overall, 123 patients were included: 77.5% (n = 83) 2-stage and 40 (32.5%) 3-stage IPAA. Mean age was 68.7 ± 3.9 years, with 43 (34.9%) women. The use of the 3-stage IPAA increased over time (18.8% in 2012 vs. 33.3% in 2016), with decreasing use of 2-stage IPAA(81.3% vs. 66.7%, p < 0.001). The morbidity associated with the procedures decreased over time, overall (81.3% in 2012 and 51.5% in 2016, p < 0.001) and in each group individually. No differences were observed in postoperative complications across groups (45.8% 2-stage, 32.5% 3-stage). The overall mean costs of care when no postoperative complications occurred was $25,910, vs. $38,577 when any complication occurred (p < 0.001), but no differences were observed between groups. CONCLUSIONS: In a national analysis, there was a trend of increasing 3-stage vs. 2-stage IPAA for UC in older Americans. Complications and complication-associated costs were comparable across approaches, suggesting that the choice of procedure type should be based on the specific patient comorbidities and surgeon preferences.","Pellino, G; Reif de Paula, T; Lawlor, G; Keller, D S",Tech. coloproctol,122,25

We developed a mathematical model to simulate the COVID-19 pandemic with digital contact tracing and testing strategies. The model uses a real-world social network generated from a high-resolution contact data set of 180 students. This model incorporates infectivity variations, test sensitivities, incubation period, and asymptomatic cases. We present a method to extend the weighted temporal social network and present simulations on a network of 5000 students. The purpose of this work is to investigate optimal quarantine rules and testing strategies with digital contact tracing. The results show that the traditional strategy of quarantining direct contacts reduces infections by less than 20% without sufficient testing. Periodic testing every 2 weeks without contact tracing reduces infections by less than 3%. A variety of strategies are discussed including testing second and third degree contacts and the pre-exposure notification system, which acts as a social radar warning users how far they are from COVID-19. The most effective strategy discussed in this work was combined the pre-exposure notification system with testing second and third degree contacts. This strategy reduces infections by 18.3% when 30% of the population uses the app, 45.2% when 50% of the population uses the app, 72.1% when 70% of the population uses the app, and 86.8% when 95% of the population uses the app. When simulating the model on an extended network of 5000 students, the results are similar with the contact tracing app reducing infections by up to 79%.","Xu, Daniel",,122,24

Although emerging studies have identified lymphopenia as a driver of cytokine storm, disease progression and poor outcomes in infected patients, its immunopathogenesis, environmental and genetic determinants remain unclear. Understanding the interplay of these determinants in the context of lymphopenia and COVID-19 complications in African patients may help in risk stratification and appropriate deployment of targeted treatment regimens with repurposed drugs to improve prognosis. OBJECTIVE: This study is designed to investigate the role of vitamin D status, vasculopathy, apoptotic pathway and vitamin D receptor gene polymorphisms in the immunopathogenesis of lymphopenia among SARS-CoV-2 infected Africans. METHODS: This cross-sectional study will enrol 200 study participants categorized as SARS-CoV-2 negative (n=69), COVID-19 mild (n=32), hospitalized (n=72) and recovered (n=37) from two purposively selected health facilities in Lagos State. Sociodemographic, travel history and co-morbidity information will be obtained from case file and study pre-tested interviewer-based structured questionnaire. Venous blood samples (5ml) collected between 8.00-10.00 h and aliquoted into EDTA and plain tubes will be used for complete blood count and CD4 T cells assays to determine lymphopenia (Lymphocyte count < 1000 cells/uL) and CD4 T lymphocyte levels as well as measuring the concentrations of vitamin D, caspase 3, sVCAM-1 and sFasL using an autoanalyzer, flow cytometry and ELISA techniques. Genomic DNA will be extracted from buffy coat and used as template for the amplification of apoptosis related genes (Bax, Bcl-2, BCl-2LI2) by PCR and genotyping of vitamin D receptor (VDR: Apa1, Foh1 and Bsm1) gene polymorphisms by PCR-RFLP and capillary sequencing. Total RNA will also be extracted, reverse transcribed and subsequently quantitated by RT-PCR to monitor the expression of apoptosis genes in the four categories of COVID-19 study participants enrolled. Data analyses, which include test of association between VDR gene polymorphisms and study outcomes (Lymphopenia and hypovitaminosis D prevalence, mild/moderate and severe infections) will be performed using the R Statistical Software. Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) and linkage disequilibrium analyses for alleles, genotype and haplotypes of the genotyped VDR gene will also be carried out. RESULTS: A total of 45 participants comprising 37 SARS-CoV-2 negative and 8 COVID-19 recovered participants have been enrolled so far with their complete blood counts and CD4 T lymphocyte counts determined as well as having all their serum samples and genomic DNA and RNA sample extracted and stored at -200C until further analyses. Other expected outcomes include prevalence and distribution of lymphopenia and hypovitaminosis D among the control (SARS-CoV-2 negative), confirmed, hospitalized and recovered SARS-CoV-2 positive study participants, association lymphopenia with CD4 T lymphocyte level, serum vitamin D, sVCAM-1, sFasL and caspase 3 levels in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, expression levels of apoptosis related genes among hospitalized COVID-19 study participants, those with lymphopenia compared with those without lymphopenia and Frequency distribution of alleles, genotypes and haplotypes of VDR gene polymorphisms in COVID-19 afflicted Nigerians studied. CONCLUSIONS: This study will aid in the genotypic and phenotypic stratification of COVID-19 afflicted Nigerian patients with and without lymphopenia to enable biomarker discovery and pave way for appropriate and timely deployment of patient-centered treatments to improve prognosis.","Iwalokun, Bamidele Abiodun; Olalekan, Adesola; Adenipekun, Eyitayo; Ojo, Olabisi; Iwalokun, Olusola Senapon; Mutiu, Bamidele; Orija, Oluseyi; Adegbola, Richard; Salako, Babatunde; Akinloye, Oluyemi",,122,30

We performed a comparative genomic analysis of 70 ACE2 placental mammal orthologues to identify variations and contribute to the understanding of evolutionary dynamics behind this successful adaptation to infect humans. Our results reveal that 4% of the ACE2 sites are under positive selection, all located in the catalytic domain, suggesting possibly taxon-specific adaptations related to the ACE2 function, such as cardiovascular physiology. Considering all variable sites, we selected 30 of them located at the critical ACE2 binding sites to the SARS-CoV-like viruses for analysis in more detail. Our results reveal a relatively high diversity of ACE2 between placental mammal species, while showing no polymorphism within human populations, at least considering the 30 inter-species variable sites. A perfect scenario for natural selection favored this opportunistic new coronavirus in its trajectory of infecting humans. We suggest that SARS-CoV-2 became a specialist coronavirus for human hosts. Differences in the rate of infection and mortality could be related to the innate immune responses, other unknown genetic factors, as well as non-biological factors.","Fam, Bibiana S.

Current understanding of moderate-to-severe COVID-19 pathophysiology points toward an underlying cytokine release driving a hyperinflammatory and procoagulant state. In this scenario, white blood cells and platelets play a direct role as effectors of such inflammation and thrombotic response. We investigate whether hemogram-derived ratios such as neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio and the systemic immune-inflammation index may help to identify patients at risk of fatal outcomes. Activated platelets and neutrophils may be playing a decisive role during the thromboinflammatory phase of COVID-19 so, in addition, we introduce and validate a novel marker, the neutrophil-to-platelet ratio (NPR).Two thousand and eighty-eight hospitalized patients with COVID-19 admitted at any of the hospitals of HM Hospitales group in Spain, from March 1 to June 10, 2020, were categorized according to the primary outcome of in-hospital death.Baseline values, as well as the rate of increase of the four ratios analyzed were significantly higher at hospital admission in patients who died than in those who were discharged (p<0.0001).

Simultaneously, some older adults faced neglect and blatant displays of ageism (e.g., #BoomerRemover) and were considered the lowest priority to receive health care. This article examines positive and negative responses toward older adults in the United States during the pandemic and the consequences for older adults and society using data from the pandemic in the United States (and informed by data from other countries) as well as past theorizing and empirical research on views and treatment of older adults. Specifically, positive responses can reinforce the value of older adults, improve older adults' mental and physical health, reduce ageism, and improve intergenerational relations, whereas negative responses can have the opposite effects. However, positive responses (social distancing to protect older adults from COVID-19 infection) can inadvertently increase loneliness, depression, health problems, and negative stereotyping of older adults (e.g., helpless, weak). Pressing policy issues evident from the treatment of older adults during the pandemic include health care (triaging, elder abuse), employment (layoffs, retirement), and education about ageism, as well as the intersection of ageism with other forms of prejudice (e.g., racism) that cuts across these policies.

We tested the hypothesis that FDA-approved antiretrovirals, antibiotics, and antimalarials will effectively inhibit COVID-19 two major drug targets, coronavirus nucleocapsid protein (NP) and hemagglutinin-esterase (HE). To test this hypothesis, we carried out a phylogenic analysis of coronavirus genome to understand the origins of NP and HE, and also modeled the proteins before molecular docking, druglikeness, toxicity assessment, molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) and ligand-based pharmacophore modeling of the selected FDA-approved drugs. Our models for NP and HE had over 95% identity with templates 5EPW and 3CL5 respectively in the PDB database, with majority of the amino acids occupying acceptable regions. The active sites of the proteins contained conserved residues that were involved in ligand binding. Lopinavir and ritonavir possessed greater binding affinities for NP and HE relative to remdesivir, while levofloxacin and hydroxychloroquine were the most notable among the other classes of drugs. The Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD), Root Mean Square Fluctuation (RMSF), Radius of gyration (Rg), and binding energy values obtained after 100 ns of MDS revealed good stability of these compounds in the binding sites of the proteins while important pharmacophore features were also identified. The study showed that COVID-19 likely originated from bat, owing to the over 90% genomic similarity observed, and that lopinavir, levofloxacin, and hydroxychloroquine might serve as potential anti-COVID-19 lead molecules for additional optimization and drug development for the treatment of COVID-19.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Since it was identified in Hubei, China, in December 2019, COVID-19 has rapidly spread around the world and been declared a pandemic. Based on data from Hubei, infection and death distributions vary with age. To control the spread of the disease, various preventive and control measures such as community quarantine and social distancing have been widely used. OBJECTIVE: Our aim is to develop a model where age is a factor, considering the study area's age stratification. Additionally, we want to account for the effects of quarantine on the SEIR model. METHODS: We use the age-stratified COVID-19 infection and death distributions from Hubei, China (more than 44,672 infections as of February 11, 2020) as an estimate or proxy for a study area's infection and mortality probabilities for each age group. We then apply these probabilities to the actual age-stratified population of Quezon City, Philippines, to predict infectious individuals and deaths at peak. Testing with different countries shows the predicted number of infectious individuals skewing with the country's median age and age stratification, as expected. We added a Q parameter to the SEIR model to include the effects of quarantine (Q-SEIR). RESULTS: The projections from the age-stratified probabilities give much lower predicted incidences of infection than the Q-SEIR model. As expected, quarantine tends to delay the peaks for both the exposed and infectious groups, and to ""flatten"" the curve or lower the predicted values for each compartment. These two estimates were used as a range to inform the local government's planning and response to the COVID-19 threat. CONCLUSIONS: Age stratification combined with a quarantine-modified model has good qualitative agreement with observations on infections and death rates. That younger populations will have lower death rates due to COVID-19 is a fair expectation for a disease where most fatalities are among older adults.","Bongolan, Vena Pearl; Minoza, Jose Marie Antonio; de Castro, Romulo; Sevilleja, Jesus Emmanuel",J Med Internet Res,122,1

Prior transcriptomic studies of host cells in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection have not reported to date the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the MVP. In this study, we accessed public data sets to report in silico investigations into gene expression. In addition, we proposed candidate genes that are thought to have a direct association with the pathogenesis of COVID-19, and which may be dependent on signals derived from the MVP. Our results revealed dysregulation of genes involved in the MVP. These results were not found when investigating the gene expression data from host cells infected with H3N2 influenza virus, H1N1 influenza virus, or respiratory syncytial virus. Our manually curated gene set showed significant gene expression variability in A549 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2, as per Blanco-Melo et al. data set (GSE147507).

Anchoring on the assumption that the religiosity of an individual has a profound impact on their emotions, resilience, and wellness, this study investigated the levels of the centrality of religiosity, emotions towards God, resilience, and wellness among 399 Taiwanese university students. Data analysis included descriptive statistics, factor analysis, group comparisons, multiple regression, and mediation analysis. Findings showed that most of the participants were religious. Furthermore, the 16 emotions towards God were successfully factored into three distinct sub-groups, namely: pleasant, unpleasant, and moral valence, which were later found to be quite related to Asian religions. More importantly, the results suggested that the resiliency of an individual can be attributed to their belief in the existence of God or the Divine, while the wellness indicators of security and satisfaction were related to one's religiosity. Lastly, structural equation modeling showed that resilience fully mediated the relationship between the ideology dimension of religiosity and the security and satisfaction component of wellness. In addition to discussing these significant results, this paper also included some implications of the study results, particularly the importance of religiosity and emotions toward God or the Divine in sustaining resilience and promoting wellness, especially in the context of crisis, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Edara, Inna Reddy; Del Castillo, Fides; Ching, Gregory Siy; Del Castillo, Clarence Darro",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),122,15

Studies reveal that SARS-CoV-2 is very similar in structure and pathogenicity with SARS-CoV, but the most important structural protein, i.e., the spike protein (S), is slightly different in these viruses.

Due to the unique circumstances of providing transitional care in a pandemic, post-discharge providers must adapt to specific needs and limitations identified for the care of COVID-19 patients. In this study, we conducted a retrospective chart review of all hospitalized COVID-19 patients discharged from an Emory Healthcare Hospital in Atlanta, GA from March 26 to April 21, 2020 to characterize their post-discharge care plans. A total of 310 patients were included in the study (median age 58, range: 23-99; 51.0% female; 69.0% African American). The most common presenting comorbidities were hypertension (200, 64.5%), obesity (BMI&#8805;30) (138, 44.5%), and diabetes mellitus (112, 36.1%). The median length of hospitalization was 5 days (range: 0-33). Sixty-seven patients (21.6%) were admitted to the intensive care unit and 42 patients (13.5%) received invasive mechanical ventilation. The most common complications recorded at discharge were electrolyte abnormalities (124, 40.0%), acute kidney injury (86, 27.7%) and sepsis (55, 17.7%). The majority of patients were discharged directly home (281, 90.6%). Seventy-five patients (24.2%) required any home service including home health and home oxygen therapy. The most common follow-up need was an appointment with a primary care provider (258, 83.2%). Twenty-four patients (7.7%) had one or more visit to an ED after discharge and 16 patients (5.2%) were readmitted. To our knowledge, this is the first large study to report on post-discharge medical care for COVID-19 patients.","Loerinc, Leah B; Scheel, Amy M; Evans, Sean T; Shabto, Julie M; O039,; Keefe, Ghazala A; Keefe, James B",Healthc (Amst),122,33

Demographic features of the patients, clinical manifestations, laboratory data, treatments, and clinical outcome were evaluated. The mean age of 58 HD patients was 63.2 ± 13.8 (30-93) years and female-male ratio was 0.34. SARS-CoV2-PCR positivity rate was 32.8%. 85.2% of patients (n = 46) had bilateral lesions and 14.8% (n = 8) had unilateral one lesion in chest CT. The most common symptoms were fatigue (in 44 patients, 80%) and dyspnea (in 31 patients, 56.4%). The most common comorbidity was HT (in 37 patients, 67.3%). The patients who need intensive care and died were older (p = 0.015). We observed lower platelet and eosinophil counts, potassium levels, higher AST, troponin and CRP levels in the group of patients who need intensive care and died than the group who survived (p = 0.043, 0.005, 0.033, 0.007, 0.001, <0.001, respectively). 15.5% of the patients (n = 9) were transferred to intensive care unit.

We explored the experience of urologists who had to delay their patients' cancer care. Methods: Urologists who treat prostate, bladder, and renal cancers, selected through purposive sampling, responded to a survey about cancer treatment delay. They were asked about their practice setting, decision making and interactions with patients, and they were asked to reflect on their personal experience. A 0 to 10 point scale, modeled on the National Comprehensive Cancer Network' Distress Thermometer (NCCN-DT), validated for cancer patients with cancer, was used to estimate physician distress. We used descriptive statistics to analyze survey results. Results: Of the 64 participating urologists, 98% delayed surgical treatment;fewer delayed cases of advanced cancers (42% for &gt;= T3/T4 or Gleason &gt;= 8 prostate cancers, 58% for muscle invasive bladder cancer, 61% for &gt;= T2 renal cancers).

They relied on their own risk assessments (67%) and consulted colleagues ( 56%) and national guidelines (53%) when making treatment deferral decisions. They identified a number of concerns as they resumed surgeries. Conclusions: Based on a comparison to the NCCN-DT clinical cutoff distress level of 4, urologists experienced moderately high levels of distress as they delayed cancer care during the COVID-19 pandemic and expressed concerns going forward. While the focus on patient care is paramount in a pandemic, it is important to recognize physician distress and develop practical and psychological strategies for distress mitigation.","Wittmann, D.; Faris, A.; Montie, J.

Method: An online survey of speech therapists in Hong Kong was conducted between February and March in 2020. The survey comprised up to 15 questions to assess participants' demographics, existing service delivery in telepractice, perception, and their training and knowledge on telepractice. Results: One hundred thirty-five speech (n = 135) speech language pathologists responded to the survey. About one-third (34.8%; n = 47) of participants reported having provided services through telepractice, whereas 72.3% of them started in <3 months and half of them considered it was less effective than face-to-face service. Among the other participants (n = 88), 83% of them indicated that unsuitable patient type and age as the main reason for not providing telepractice. The majority of participants had no prior training for delivering telepractice, and focused on technology when asked about their desired training. Knowledge of participants on telepractice was found only to align fairly with international guidelines. Discussions: The survey findings suggested that telepractice provision in Hong Kong was different from that of other countries where telepractice has been well established, due to the accelerated emergence by the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions: The study showed how the development of telepractice would be like in a short time frame, and findings on perception and desired training could be a reference for a better establishment of this model of service.","Fong, Raymond; Tsai, Chun Fung; Yiu, Oi Yan",Telemed. j. e. health,122,1

While the disease is known to primarily affect the respiratory system, gastrointestinal manifestations can also occur. However, little is known about the development of acute pancreatitis in COVID-19. The present report highlights a patient with no precipitating risk factors for pancreatitis who presented with recurring acute pancreatitis following the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. CASE REPORT An otherwise healthy 38-year-old man presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with fever and epigastric pain. Laboratory testing revealed a lipase level of 10 255 ukat/L. An abdominal ultrasound showed no gallstones. After ruling out the possible causes of acute pancreatitis, a diagnosis of idiopathic acute pancreatitis was made. He received conservative management and was discharged home after being medically stabilized. Of note, the patient tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection at a local testing center 1 week prior to presenting to the ED. One week following the discharge, the patient returned with recurrent severe epigastric pain. Laboratory testing showed a lipase level of 20 320 ukat/L. An abdominal CT revealed acute pancreatitis. Further workups, including abdominal ultrasound, hepatitis serology, and immunoglobulin G for autoimmune pancreatitis, were unrevealing. Repeated SARS-CoV-2 testing produced positive results. CONCLUSIONS The temporal relationship between clinical presentation of acute pancreatitis and SARS-CoV-2 infection in this patient with no precipitating risk factors for pancreatitis suggests COVID-19-associated acute pancreatitis. Our review of the literature found a handful of reported cases of acute pancreatitis in patients with coexisting SARS-CoV-2 infection, and this report presents the first presumptive case of COVID-19-associated recurring acute pancreatitis.","Cheung, Szeya; Delgado Fuentes, Alain; Fetterman, Alan D",Am J Case Rep,122,26

knowledge, attitude and practice study);and Nipah virus circulation in bat and human populations (virus monitoring in bat urine and anti-Nipah-virus antibody detection in human serum) Findings Our results confirmed circulation of Nipah virus in fruit bats (28 of 3930 urine samples positive by polymerase chain reaction testing) We identified clear potential routes for virus transmission to humans through local practices, including fruit consumed by bats and harvested by humans when Nipah virus is circulating, and palm juice production Nevertheless, in the serological survey of 418 potentially exposed people, none of them were seropositive to Nipah virus Differences in agricultural practices among the regions where Nipah virus has emerged may explain the situation in Cambodia and point to actions to limit the risks of virus transmission to humans Conclusion Human practices are key to understanding transmission risks associated with emerging infectious diseases Social science disciplines such as anthropology need to be integrated in health programmes targeting emerging infectious diseases As bats are hosts of major zoonotic pathogens, such integrated studies would

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic had suspended dental practice globally for over 3 months. While dental practice is being resumed cautiously, standard infection control protocols that were traditionally overlooked are now being strictly implemented. Post-COVID-19, dental care is expected to see a drastic change in the way it is practiced. REVIEW RESULTS: With a view on the natural history and disease dynamics of COVID-19, this review reports various aspects of dental care, viz., patient triaging, engineering and work practice controls, and administrative, financial, and ethical aspects of dental care during and after COVID-19 pandemic. Current evidence-based recommendations with regard to infection-control practices are discussed. A call for universal oral health care with suggestions regarding integration of medical and health care is also proposed. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is expected to be a watershed moment in the field of dentistry. While we expect to see positive changes in safe delivery of dental care, an increase in cost of availing care is imminent. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The practice of dentistry and dental infection control has undergone dimensional changes due to bloodborne infectious diseases such as hepatitis B virus infections and human immunodeficiency virus epidemic. Due to these pandemics, many regulatory organizations have provided safety recommendations and guidelines that impact the dental practice. Currently, we are faced with a highly infective disease with a high mortality rate among people with comorbidities and of predominantly droplet transmission and no concrete safety recommendations and guidelines. This manuscript addresses multiple issues, gaps, and pragmatic solutions in controlling transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in dental settings, during and after the pandemic.","Janakiram, Chandrashekar; Nayar, Suresh; Varma, Balagopal; Ramanarayanan, Venkitachalam; Mathew, Anil; Suresh, Rakesh; Puttaiah, Raghunath",J Contemp Dent Pract,122,1

The attitudes and experiences of psychotherapists with respect to online therapy (OT) have so far been generally poorly studied and particularly with a view to the situation during the pandemic. Objective: The aim of the study was to examine 1) the frequency of utilization of OT during the first lockdown, 2) the satisfaction with OT versus face-to-face therapy and 3) the technology acceptance experience overall and with respect to the guideline procedures. Material and methods: German psychotherapists licensed and in training, cognitive-behavioral (CB 45.6%), analytic (AP 14%), depth-psychological (DP 34.5%), systemic (SYS 5.8%), were invited to participate in an online survey on demographic and therapeutic data, use of OT, satisfaction with OT vs. face-to-face therapy (Zufriedenheitsfragebogen für Therapeuten, ZUF-THERA) and technology acceptance (Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 Questionnaire, UTAUT). Results: The 174 participating psychotherapists (mean ageâ¯= 44.73 years, SD ±â¯12.79; female 81.6%) reported that the average proportion of OT in the total therapeutic activity during the lockdown was 43.09%, with significant differences between guideline procedures (DP, CBâ¯> AP). The satisfaction with OT proved to be significantly lower than with face-to-face therapy and did not differ between the procedures. Prior experience with OT was reported by 23.6% of therapists overall and was higher among those working systemically compared to CB or AP therapists. Therapists working in CB experienced more enjoyment with OT than those working in DP and AP as well as perceived a stronger social influence (e.g. through colleagues) in the use of OT than therapists working in DP. Conclusion: The frequency of use of OT soared during the first lockdown (March-May 2020, 43% in comparison to the former limit covered by health insurances of 20%). In principle, therapists were highly satisfied with OT but significantly lower than with face-to-face therapy. Further studies analyzing the reasons for this in detail are urgently recommended.","Beck-Hiestermann, Franziska Marie Lea; Kästner, Denise; Gumz, Antje",Psychotherapeut (Berl),122,16

The time series available for the analysis represent the purchases (expenditure and quantities) of all consumers and by income groups were used to compute price and quantity indices all the meats together and for each meat (i.e., beef, lamb, pork, poultry, and other meats) and fish. The changes in expenditure were decomposed into changes in prices, quantities purchased and changes in quality purchased (trading up/down in quality) i.e., whether cheaper meat or fish were purchased. A further extension of the analysis was produced by considering the evolution of calories, saturated fats and sodium per purchased quantity for meat and fish during the period of study. The results indicate that although the shares of quantities remained relatively constant, the calories, saturated fats and sodium from the purchased quantities showed an increasing trend, indicating that most of the incomes groups were lowering the nutritional quality of their meat and fish purchases. This is clearly shown by the fact ""other meats"" represents on average 39 percent of the calories contributed by meat and fish, 49 per cent of the saturated fats and about 68 of the total sodium in meat and fish during the lockdown period. This result highlights the need to emphasize healthy messages related to the purchases of meat.","Revoredo-Giha, C.; Russo, C.",Frontiers in Nutrition,122,16

However, they visualize state changes as either slope or difference of bars, which has been proved less effective for quantitative comparison. Also, both visual designs suffer from visual clutter issues with an increasing number of data items. In this paper, we propose Intercept Graph, a novel visual design to facilitate effective interactive comparison of state changes. Specifically, a radial design is proposed to visualize the starting and ending states of each data item and the line segment length explicitly encodes the""state change"". By interactively adjusting the radius of the inner circular axis, Intercept Graph can smoothly filter the large state changes and magnify the difference between similar state changes, mitigating the visual clutter issues and enhancing the effective comparison of state changes. We conducted a case study through comparing Intercept Graph with slope graphs and grouped bar charts on real datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of Intercept Graph.","Ruan, Shaolun; Wang, Yong; Guan, Qiang",,122,11

In this paper we have tried to build a two phased face mask detector which will be easy to deploy at the mentioned outlets. With the help of Computer Vision, it is now possible to detect and implement this on large scale. We have used CNN/ MobileNet V2 architecture for the implementation of our model. The implementation is done in Python, and the python script implementation will train our face mask detector on our selected dataset using TensorFlow and Keras. We have added more robust features and trained our model on various variations, we made sure to have large varied and augmented dataset so that the model is able to clearly identify and detection the face masks in real time videos. The trained model was tested on both real-time videos and static pictures and in both the cases the accuracy was more than the other designed models. © 2021 IEEE.","Sakshi, S.; Gupta, A.

One of these is the administration of exogenous surfactant, which is being tested in ongoing clinical trials. AREAS COVERED: Exogenous surfactant is a life-saving treatment for premature infants with neonatal respiratory distress syndrome. This treatment has also been tested for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with limited success possibly due to the complexity of that syndrome. The 60-year history of successes and failures associated with surfactant therapy distinguishes it from many other treatments currently being tested for COVID-19 and provides the opportunity to discuss the factors that may influence the success of this therapy. EXPERT OPINION: Clinical data provide a strong rationale for using exogenous surfactant in COVID-19 patients. Success of this therapy may be influenced by the mechanical ventilation strategy, the timing of treatment, the doses delivered, the method of delivery and the preparations utilized. In addition, future development of enhanced preparations may improve this treatment approach. Overall, results from ongoing trials may not only provide data to indicate if this therapy is effective for COVID-19 patients, but also lead to further scientific understanding and improved treatment strategies.","Veldhuizen, Ruud A W; Zuo, Yi Y; Petersen, Nils O; Lewis, James F; Possmayer, Fred",Expert Rev Respir Med,122,21

After a cervical or thoracic lesion, impairment of the respiratory muscles decreases respiratory function, which increases the risk of respiratory complications. Pneumonia substantially reduces patient's quality of life, may prolong inpatient rehabilitation time, increase healthcare costs or at worse, lead to early death. Respiratory function and coughing can be improved through various interventions after SCI, but the available evidence as to which aspect of respiratory care should be optimised is inconclusive. Furthermore, ability of respiratory function parameters to predict pneumonia risk is insufficiently established. This paper details the protocol for a large-scale, multicentre research project that aims to evaluate the ability of parameters of respiratory function to predict and understand variation in inpatient risk of pneumonia in SCI. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: RESCOM, a prospective cohort study, began recruitment in October 2016 across 10 SCI rehabilitation centres from Australia, Austria, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland. Inpatients with acute SCI, with complete or incomplete cervical or thoracic lesions, 18 years or older and not/no more dependent on 24-hour mechanical ventilation within the first 3 months after injury are eligible for inclusion. The target sample size is 500 participants. The primary outcome is an occurrence of pneumonia; secondary outcomes include pneumonia-related mortality and quality of life. We will use the longitudinal data for prognostic models on inpatient pneumonia risk factors. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has been reviewed and approved by all local ethics committees of all participating centres. Study results will be disseminated to the scientific community through peer-reviewed journals and conference presentations, to the SCI community, other stakeholders and via social media, newsletters and engagement activities.

We utilized multimodality imaging to provide a detailed sequential description of the cardiac involvement. METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty consecutive patients (mean age 10.6 ± 3.8 years) presenting to our institution underwent serial echocardiographic evaluation on admission (median day 5 of illness), the day coinciding with worst cardiac function (median day 7), and the day of discharge (median day 15). We performed cardiac computed tomography (CT) to assess coronary anatomy (median day 15) and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) to assess dysfunction (median day 20). On admission, almost all patients displayed abnormal strain and tissue Doppler indices. Three-dimensional (3D) echocardiographic ejection fraction (EF) was <55% in half of the patients. Valvular regurgitation (75%) and small pericardial effusions (10%) were detected. Serial echocardiography demonstrated that the mean 3D EF deteriorated (54.7 ± 8.3% vs. 46.4 ± 8.6%, P = 0.017) before improving at discharge (P = 0.008). Left main coronary artery (LMCA) dimensions were significantly larger at discharge than at admission (Z score -0.11 ± 0.87 vs. 0.78 ± 1.23, P = 0.007). CT showed uniform coronary artery dilatation commonly affecting the LMCA (9/12). CMR detected abnormal strain in all patients with global dysfunction (EF <55%) in 35%, myocardial oedema in 50%, and subendocardial infarct in 5% (1/20) patients. CONCLUSIONS: Pancarditis with cardiac dysfunction is common and associated with myocardial oedema. Patients require close monitoring due to coronary artery dilatation and the risk of thrombotic myocardial infarction.","Theocharis, Paraskevi; Wong, James; Pushparajah, Kuberan; Mathur, Sujeev K; Simpson, John M; Pascall, Emma; Cleary, Aoife; Stewart, Kirsty; Adhvaryu, Kaitav; Savis, Alex; Kabir, Saleha R; Uy, Mirasol Pernia; Heard, Hannah; Peacock, Kelly; Miller, Owen",European heart journal.

Our goal is to have a direct impact on instructors who are in the beginning stages of transitioning their educational innovations from anecdotal to empirical results that can be replicated by instructors at other institutions. To achieve this, we created a year-long mentoring experience, beginning with a multi-day workshop on empirical research methods during the summer, followed by regular mentoring sessions with participants, and culminating in a follow-up session at the following year's SIGCSE Technical Symposium. From survey results and as evidenced by eventual research results and publications from participants, we believe that our method of structuring empirical research professional development was successful and could be a model for similar programs in other areas.","Carver, Jeffrey C.; Heckman, Sarah; Sherriff, Mark",,122,33

Cyclosporine is an immunosuppressive drug, which is widely used in medicine, including in the treatment of autoimmune skin diseases in dermatology, rheumatology, ophthalmology and nephrology, and in organ transplantation. A usual concern associated with immunosuppressive treatment is the potential risk of infections. Interestingly, several data indicate a relatively low risk of infections, especially viral infections, in patients receiving cyclosporine. It was shown that cyclosporine exerts an inhibitory effect on the replication of some viruses, or may have a potentially beneficial effect on the disease course in infections. These include hepatitis C, influenza virus, rotavirus, human immunodeficiency virus and coronavirus infections. Available data indicate that cyclosporine may have a beneficial effect on COVID-19, which is caused by the coronavirus SARS-COV2.","Glowacka, Paulina; Rudnicka, Lidia; Warszawik-Hendzel, Olga; Sikora, Mariusz; Goldust, Mohamad; Gajda, Patrycja; Stochmal, Anna; Blicharz, Leszek; Rakowska, Adriana; Olszewska, Malgorzata",Biology,122,3

Quantitative and qualitative methods were used together in the study. A technology awareness and computational thinking scale was chosen as the quantitative data collection tool, while mind maps were used as the qualitative data collection tool. As a result of the research, a significant increase in the participants' technology awareness and computational thinking was determined in favour of the posttest, while this increase was verified through the mind-mapping technique applied to the students. At the end of the study, the findings were discussed, and recommendations were made for future studies. In addition, a great limitation of this research was the effectiveness of activities that had to be carried out entirely remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The SARS CoV-2 pandemic, and the complete lockdown required during the first wave in most countries are stressors for pregnant women and can lead to anxiety and depression during pregnancy. The aim of this study was to explore depression and anxiety symptoms, and social support in pregnant women during the SARS CoV-2 lockdown, as well as to explore demographic risk factors. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective cohort study was performed at Hospital Universitari Vall d'Hebron, Barcelona, including pregnant women attending the antenatal clinic during the SARS-CoV2 lockdown period. Three questionnaires were administered to study depression (EPDS), anxiety (STAI) and Social Support (MOS-SSS). STAI state (STAIs) described the actual state of anxiety and the STAI trait (STAIt) described the trait of anxiety. A cut-off of 10 for EPDS and 40 for STAI was considered to be clinically relevant. The main outcome measures were depression and anxiety symptoms. RESULTS: A total of 217 women were invited to participate, and 204 accepted (94%). From these, 164 filled in the EPDS, 109 STAI and 159 MOS-SSS questionnaires: 37.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 30.5%-45.7%) (62/164) of women showed an EPDS result &#8805;10, 59.6% (95% CI 49.8%-68.8%) (65/109) a STAI state (STAIs) &#8805;40, and 58.7% (95% CI 48.9%-67.9%) (64/109) a STAI trait (STAIt) &#8805;40. Regression analysis showed that mental health disorder, Latin American origin and lack of social support were independent risk factors for anxiety symptoms in the STAIs (P = .032, P = .040 and P = .029, respectively). Regarding depressive symptoms, maternal body mass index, mental health disorders and social support were independent factors (P = .013, P = .015 and P = .000, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: A lockdown scenario during the first wave of the SARS-CoV 2 pandemic increased the symptoms of anxiety and depression among pregnant women, particularly affecting those with less social support.","Brik, Maia; Sandonis, Miguel Angel; Fernández, Sara; Suy, Anna; Parramon-Puig, Gemma; Maiz, Nerea; Dip, Maria Emilia; Ramos-Quiroga, Josep Antoni; Carreras, Elena",Acta obstet. gynecol. scand,122,9

The objective was to verify the factors associated with sarcopenia in institutionalized elderly. METHODS: In total, 219 elderly individuals (&#8805;60 years old) living in long-term institutions in Natal/RN were included in the study. After defining the elderly as sarcopenic or non-sarcopenic, anthropometric, biochemical, sociodemographic and health-related were analyzed. The Student t-test and Mann-Whitney test were used to analyze the quantitative, while the chi-square test was used for the qualitative variables. Finally, Poisson regression was used to provide prevalence ratios for those variables that presented differences in the bivariate analyses. RESULTS: Physical capacity and anthropometry were associated with sarcopenia. For each 1 cm of knee height, the elderly presented 2.71% more chance of not having sarcopenia, and eutrophic or overweight individuals (according to BMI) presented 37.71 and 91.81% chances, respectively, of not presenting sarcopenia. Elderly individuals who ambulate have a 30.08% chance of not being considered sarcopenic.

METHOD: A literature review was conducted using Google Scholar® and MEDLINE®/PubMed® to identify current available evidence regarding the sensitivity of CT chest compared with RT-PCR for the diagnosis of COVID-19-positive patients. GRADE criteria and the QUADAS 2 tool were used to assess the level of evidence. RESULTS: A total of 20 articles were identified that addressed the question of sensitivity of CT for diagnosis of symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19-positive patients. Overall sensitivity of CT scan ranged from 57%-100% for symptomatic and 46%-100% for asymptomatic COVID-19 patients, while that of RT-PCR ranged from 39%-89%. CT chest was a better diagnostic modality and capable of detecting active infection earlier in the time course of infection than RT-PCR in symptomatic patients. In asymptomatic patients, disease prevalence seems to play a role in the positive predictive value. Minimal evidence exists regarding the sensitivity of CT in patients who are asymptomatic. CONCLUSIONS: In surgical patients, CT chest should be considered as an important adjunct for detection of COVID-19 infection in patients who are symptomatic with negative RT-PCR prior to any operation. For surgical patients who are asymptomatic, there is insufficient evidence to recommend routine preoperative CT chest for COVID-19 screening.","Shao, J M; Ayuso, S A; Deerenberg, E B; Elhage, S A; Augenstein, V A; Heniford, B T",Colorectal dis,122,1

Although Real Time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) of respiratory specimens is the gold standard test for detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection, collecting nasopharyngeal swabs causes discomfort to patients and may represent considerable risk for healthcare workers. The use of saliva as a diagnostic sample has several advantages. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to validate the use of saliva as a biological sample for diagnosis of COVID-19. METHODS: This study was conducted at Infectious Diseases Research Laboratory (LAPI), in Salvador, Brazil. Participants presenting with signs/symptoms suggesting SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent a nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and/or oropharyngeal swab (OPS), and saliva collection. Saliva samples were diluted in PBS, followed by RNA isolation and RT-Real Time PCR for SARS-CoV-2. Results of conventional vs saliva samples testing were compared. Statistical analyses were performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software (SPSS) version 18.0. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-five participants were recruited and samples pairs of NPS/OPS and saliva were collected. The sensitivity and specificity of RT-PCR using saliva samples were 94.4% (95% CI 86.4-97.8) and 97.62% (95% CI 91.7-99.3), respectively. There was an overall high agreement (96.1%) between the two tests. CONCLUSIONS: Use of self-collected saliva samples is an easy, convenient, and low-cost alternative to conventional NP swab-based molecular tests. These results may allow a broader use of molecular tests for management of COVID19 pandemic, especially in resources-limited settings.","Vaz, Sara Nunes; Santana, Daniele Souza de; Netto, Eduardo Martins; Pedroso, Celia; Wang, Wei-Kung; Santos, Felice Deminco Alves; Brites, Carlos",Braz J Infect Dis,122,24

Methods: Sixty-six patients with dry eye disease (DED) and 62 healthy subjects (group 2) using FM were enrolled. Groups were divided into: groups 1A and 2A: < 3 hours of FM wear; groups 1B and 2B: 3 to 6 hours; and groups 1C and 2C: > 6 hours. Patients underwent DEQS questionnaire, break-up time (BUT), Schirmer test I (STI), fluorescein and lissamine staining (FS and LS), IVCM to determine corneal dendritic cell density (DCD) and goblet cell density (GCD), and IC to measure HLA-DR, at baseline and after 3 months. Results: FM use duration before enrollment was 27 ± 2.3 and 30 ± 4.1 (days ± SD) for groups 1 and 2 (P > 0.05). After 3 months, DEQS worsened in groups 1B and 1C, STI in groups 1A to 1C, FS and LS in group 1C (P < 0.05); in controls, BUT and FS worsened only in group 2C (P < 0.05). DCD significantly increased in groups 1A to 1C and HLA-DR in groups 1B and 1C (P < 0.05), whereas GCD did not significantly change. DCD and HLA-DR increased only in group 2C (P < 0.05).

The study's objective was to group counties with similar trajectories of COVID-19 cases and deaths and identify county-level correlates of the distinct trajectory groups. METHODS: Daily COVID-19 cases and deaths were obtained from 3141 US counties from January through June 2020. Clusters of epidemic curve trajectories of COVID-19 cases and deaths per 100,000 people were identified with Proc Traj. We utilized polytomous logistic regression to estimate Odds Ratios for trajectory group membership in relation to county-level demographics, socioeconomic factors, school enrollment, employment and lifestyle data. RESULTS: Six COVID-19 case trajectory groups and five death trajectory groups were identified. Younger counties, counties with a greater proportion of females, Black and Hispanic populations, and greater employment in private sectors had higher odds of being in worse case and death trajectories. Percentage of counties enrolled in grades 1-8 was associated with earlier-start case trajectories. Counties with more educated adult populations had lower odds of being in worse case trajectories but were generally not associated with worse death trajectories. Counties with higher poverty rates, higher uninsured, and more living in non-family households had lower odds of being in worse case and death trajectories. Counties with higher smoking rates had higher odds of being in worse death trajectory counties. DISCUSSION: In the absence of clear guidelines and personal protection, smoking, racial and ethnic groups, younger populations, social, and economic factors were correlated with worse COVID-19 epidemics that may reflect population transmission dynamics during January-June 2020. After vaccination of high-risk individuals, communities with higher proportions of youth, communities of color, smokers, and workers in healthcare, service and goods industries can reduce viral spread by targeting vaccination programs to these populations and increasing access and education on non-pharmaceutical interventions.","DuPre, Natalie C; Karimi, Seyed; Zhang, Charlie H; Blair, Lyndsey; Gupta, Arushi; Alharbi, Lamyaa Mousa A; Alluhibi, Mariyam; Mitra, Riten; McKinney, W Paul; Little, Bert",Sci Total Environ,122,30

The causative agent of the disease, the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, shows important similarities with the previously emerged SARS-CoV-1, but also striking differences. First, SARS-CoV-2 possesses a significantly higher transmission rate and infectivity than SARS-CoV-1 and has infected in a few months over 60 million people. Moreover, COVID-19 has a systemic character, as in addition to the lungs it also affects heart, liver, and kidneys among other organs of the patients, and causes frequent thrombotic and neurological complications. In fact, the term ""viral sepsis"" has been recently coined to describe the clinical observations. Here I review current structure-function information on the viral spike proteins and the membrane fusion process to provide plausible explanations for these observations. I hypothesize that several membrane-associated serine proteinases (MASPs), in synergy with or in place of TMPRSS2, contribute to activate the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Relative concentrations of the attachment receptor, ACE2, MASPs, their endogenous inhibitors (the Kunitz-type transmembrane inhibitors, HAI-1/SPINT1 and HAI-2/SPINT2, as well as major circulating serpins) would determine the infection rate of host cells. The exclusive or predominant expression of major MASPs in specific human organs suggests a direct role of these proteinases in e.g. heart infection and myocardial injury, liver dysfunction, kidney damage, as well as neurological complications. Thorough consideration of these factors could have a positive impact on the control of the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Fuentes-Prior, Pablo",,122,26

Having to live with the employers by law, FDHs' working environment might affect their well-being during COVID-19 (e.g., household crowdedness/size, insufficiency of protective equipment against COVID-19, increased workload). Research has suggested that coping resources (e.g., social support, COVID-19-related information literacy) and COVID-19-specific worries are associated with people's well-being during COVID-19. This study examined the psychosocial correlates of probable anxiety among FDHs in Hong Kong amid the COVID-19 pandemic. By purposive sampling, FDHs (n = 295) were recruited and invited to complete a cross-sectional survey. Participants' working environment (crowdedness, household size), COVID-19 job arrangements (workload, provision of protective equipment), coping resources (social support, COVID-19 information literacy), COVID-19-specific worries (contracting COVID-19, getting fired if contracting COVID-19), and anxiety symptoms were measured. Multivariate regression results showed that the insufficiency of protective equipment (OR = 1.58, 95%CI: 1.18, 2.11), increased workload (OR = 1.51, 95%CI: 1.02, 2.25), and worries about being fired if getting COVID-19 (OR = 1.32, 95%CI: 1.04, 1.68) were significantly associated with probable anxiety.

SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, induces both specific T- and B-cell responses, being antibodies against the virus detected a few days after infection. Passive immunization with hyperimmune plasma from convalescent patients has been proposed as a potentially useful treatment for COVID-19. Using an in-house quantitative ELISA test, we found that plasma from 177 convalescent donors contained IgG antibodies specific to the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2, although at very different concentrations which correlated with previous disease severity and gender. Anti-RBD IgG plasma concentrations significantly correlated with the plasma viral neutralizing activity (VN) against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Similar results were found using an independent cohort of serum from 168 convalescent health workers. These results validate an in-house RBD IgG ELISA test in a large cohort of COVID-19 convalescent patients and indicate that plasma from all convalescent donors does not contain a high enough amount of anti-SARS-CoV-2-RBD neutralizing IgG to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. The use of quantitative anti-RBD IgG detection systems might help to predict the efficacy of the passive immunization using plasma from patients recovered from SARS-CoV-2.","Santiago, Llipsy; Uranga-Murillo, Iratxe; Arias, Maykel; González-Ramírez, Andrés Manuel; Macías-León, Javier; Moreo, Eduardo; Redrado, Sergio; García-García, Ana; Taleb, Víctor; Lira-Navarrete, Erandi; Hurtado-Guerrero, Ramón; Aguilo, Nacho; Del Mar Encabo-Berzosa, Maria; Hidalgo, Sandra; Galvez, Eva M; Ramirez-Labrada, Ariel; de Miguel, Diego; Benito, Rafael; Miranda, Patricia; Fernández, Antonio; Domingo, José María; Serrano, Laura; Yuste, Cristina; Villanueva-Saz, Sergio; Paño-Pardo, José Ramón; Pardo, Julián",,122,26

This paper starts with a review of the COVID-19 outbreak in Israel, Palestine and Jordan, in the context of the regional health systems, demography and politics. We suggest that Israel and Palestine function as one epidemiological unit, due to extensive border crossing of inhabitants and tourists, resulting in cross-border infections and potential for outbreaks' transmission. Indeed, there is a correlation between the numbers of confirmed cases with a 2-3 weeks lag. In contrast, Jordan has the ability to seal its borders and better contain the spread of the virus. We then discuss comparative public health aspects in relation to the management of COVID-19 and long term adaptation to climate change. We suggest that lessons from the current crisis can inform regional adaptation to climate change. There is an urgent need for better health surveillance, data sharing across borders, and more resilient health systems that are prepared and equipped for emergencies. Another essential and currently missing prerequisite is close cooperation within and across countries amidst political conflict, in order to protect the public health of all inhabitants of the region.","Negev, Maya; Dahdal, Yara; Khreis, Haneen; Hochman, Assaf; Shaheen, Mohammed; Jaghbir, Madi T A; Alpert, Pinhas; Levine, Hagai; Davidovitch, Nadav",Sci Total Environ,122,14

Polysaccharide is an important component of Pogostemon cablin (Blanco) Benth. but has not been studied. Pogostemon cablin (Blanco) Benth. is used to treat porcine epidemic diarrhea. But it is not known whether Pogostemon cablin polysaccharides (PCPs) has the antiviral activities against porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). AIM OF THE STUDY: The purpose of present study is to investigate the structural characterization and the anti-PEDV activities of PCPs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PCPs were prepared by water extraction and alcohol precipitation method and purified with DEAE-52 cellulose column and Sephadex G-100 column. Then, the structural characterization of the polysaccharides including the infrared spectrum, molecular weight and monosaccharide composition were analyzed. Afterwards, the antiviral effect of PCPs against PEDV on IPEC-J2 cells was studied by MTT method and real-time PCR method. Additionally, the effects of PCPs on PEDV adsorption, penetration and replication were analyzed by real-time PCR method. Furthermore, we also investigate whether the anti-oxidative effects of PCPs were important to the anti-PEDV activities. RESULTS: Four polysaccharides were obtained and named as PCP1.1 (31.3 kDa), PCP1.2 (3.5 kDa), PCP2.1 (9.1 kDa) and PCP2.2 (8.3 kDa). PCP1.1, PCP1.2 and PCP2.1 were composed of fucose, arabinose, galactose, glucose, mannose, galacturonic acid and glucuronic acid; and PCP2.2 was composed of arabinose, galactose, glucose, galacturonic acid and glucuronic acid. All PCPs showed anti-PEDV activities. PCP1.1 and PCP1.2 inhibited PEDV replication, while PCP2.1 and PCP2.2 inhibited PEDV penetration and replication. All PCPs showed anti-oxidative effects, which were important to the anti-PEDV activities. CONCLUSIONS: The treatment effect of Pogostemon cablin (Blanco) Benth. on porcine epidemic diarrhea might be related to the anti-PEDV effect of PCPs. Furthermore, the anti-oxidative effects of PCPs play important roles in their antiviral activities against PEDV.","Chen, Yun; Luo, Qiyuan; Li, Shanman; Li, Chengheng; Liao, Suya; Yang, Xin; Zhou, Ruigang; Zhu, Yongjian; Teng, Ling; Chen, Huricha; Yang, Yuhui",J Ethnopharmacol,122,1

The HIV prevention cascades have been proposed to replicate the success of the treatment cascades and reinvigorate the prevention programmes through improved monitoring, planning and delivery. We adapted the cascade framework to the PWID context in Ukraine, assessed gaps and analysed factors associated with achieving ""access"" and ""effective use"" outcomes. METHODS: Self-reported data on the use of prevention services and risk behaviours from the 2017 integrated bio-behavioural survey among PWID in Ukraine were used to construct cascades for needle/syringe and condom programmes (NSP and CP). Socio-demographic and behavioural variables were evaluated as potential correlates of cascade outcomes. RESULTS: The NSP cascade analysis included 7815 HIV-negative PWID. Motivation to use clean syringes was not assessed and assumed at 100%. Access to clean syringes through NSP in the past 12 months was reported by 2789 participants (35.7%). Effective use of syringes (no sharing in the past 30 days) was reported by 7405 participants (94.8%). NSP access was higher among women, individuals older than 44, and mixed drug users; while effective use was reported more frequently by men and opioid users, with no difference by age. The CP cascade analysis included 6606 (85%) of the HIV-negative PWID who had sex in the past three months. Of those, 2282 (34.5%) received condoms, and 1708 (25.9%) reported consistent use with all partners in the past three months. Older PWID and mixed-drug users accessed condoms more frequently; whereas younger subgroups and opioid users used them more consistently. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the cascade framework was useful to describe the status of HIV prevention among PWID in Ukraine and to identify areas for improvement in the programming and evaluation of HIV prevention. Access to needle/syringe and condom programmes was substantially below the recommended levels. Effective use of clean syringes was reported by a vast majority of PWID, although likely affected by self-report bias; whereas consistent condom use was infrequent. Socio-demographic and behavioural variables showed significant associations in NSP and CP cascade analyses, with little consistency between the access and effective use outcomes.","Dumchev, Kostyantyn; Sazonova, Yana; Smyrnov, Pavlo; Cheshun, Olga; Pashchuk, Oksana; Saliuk, Tetiana; Varetska, Olga",J Int AIDS Soc,122,29

To also to determine whether the patients were managed as COVID-19 patients after their imaging findings, and the proportion who had SARS-CoV2 reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was undertaken of consecutive patients having imaging prior to urgent elective surgery (n=156) or acute abdominal imaging (n=283). Lung findings were categorised according to the British Society of Thoracic Imaging (BSTI) guidelines. RT-PCR testing, management, and outcomes were determined from the electronic patient records. RESULTS: 3% (13/439) of CT examinations demonstrated findings of classic/probable COVID-19 pneumonia, whilst 4% (19/439) had findings indeterminate for COVID-19. Of the total cohort, 1.6% (7/439) subsequently had confirmed RT-PCR-positive COVID-19. Importantly, all the patients with a normal chest or alternative diagnoses on CT who had PCR testing within the next 7 days, had a negative RT-PCR (92/407). There was a change in surgical outcome in 6% (10/156) of the elective surgical cohort with no change to surgical management was demonstrated in the acute abdominal emergency cohort requiring surgery (2/283). CONCLUSION: There was a 7% (32/439) incidence of potential COVID-19-related lung changes in patients having preoperative CT. Although this altered surgical management in the elective surgical cohort, no change to surgical management was demonstrated in the acute abdominal emergency cohort requiring surgery.","Chetan, M R; Tsakok, M T; Shaw, R; Xie, C; Watson, R A; Wing, L; Peschl, H; Benamore, R; MacLeod, F; Gleeson, F V",Clin Radiol,122,20

Wuhan is the most serious affected city. Some measures have been taken to control the transmission of COVID-19. From Jan. 23rd, 2020, gradually increasing medical resources (such as health workforce, protective clothing, essential medicines) were sent to Wuhan from other provinces, and the government has established the hospitals to quarantine and treat infected individuals. Under the condition of sufficient medical resources in Wuhan, late-stage of epidemic showed a downward trend. Assessing the effectiveness of medical resources is of great significance for the future response to similar disease. Based on the transmission mechanisms of COVID-19 and epidemic characteristics of Wuhan, by using time-dependent rates for some parameters, we establish a dynamical model to reflect the changes of medical resources on transmission of COVID-19 in Wuhan. Our model is applied to simulate the reported data on cumulative and new confirmed cases in Wuhan from Jan. 23rd to Mar. 6th, 2020. We estimate the basic reproduction number R0 = 2.71, which determines whether the disease will eventually die out or not under the absence of effective control measures. Moreover, we calculate the effective daily reproduction ratio Re(t), which is used to measure the 'daily reproduction number'. We obtain that Re(t) drops less than 1 since Feb. 8th. Our results show that delayed opening the 'Fire God Hill' hospital will greatly increase the magnitude of the outbreak. This shows that the government's timely establishment of hospitals and effective quarantine via quick detection prevent a larger outbreak.","Wang, Li Ping; Wang, Jing; Zhao, Hong Yong; Shi, Yang Yang; Wang, Kai; Wu, Peng; Shi, Lei",Math Biosci Eng,122,24

We report the clinical characteristics of 82 cases of death from COVID-19 in a single center. Clinical data on 82 death cases laboratory-confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 infection were obtained from a Wuhan local hospital's electronic medical records according to previously designed standardized data collection forms. All patients were local residents of Wuhan, and a large proportion of them were diagnosed with severe illness when admitted. Due to the overwhelming of our system, a total of 14 patients (17.1%) were treated in the ICU, 83% of deaths never received Critical Care Support, only 40% had mechanical ventilation support despite 100% needing oxygen and the leading cause of death being pulmonary. Most of the patients who died were male (65.9%). More than half of the patients who died were older than 60 years (80.5%), and the median age was 72.5 years. The bulk of the patients who died had comorbidities (76.8%), including hypertension (56.1%), heart disease (20.7%), diabetes (18.3%), cerebrovascular disease (12.2%), and cancer (7.3%). Respiratory failure remained the leading cause of death (69.5%), followed by sepsis/MOF (28.0%), cardiac failure (14.6%), hemorrhage (6.1%), and renal failure (3.7%). Furthermore, respiratory, cardiac, hemorrhagic, hepatic, and renal damage were found in 100%, 89%, 80.5%, 78.0%, and 31.7% of patients, respectively. On admission, lymphopenia (89.2%), neutrophilia (74.3%), and thrombocytopenia (24.3%) were usually observed. Most patients had a high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio of >5 (94.5%), high systemic immune-inflammation index of >500 (89.2%), and increased C-reactive protein (100%), lactate dehydrogenase (93.2%), and D-dimer (97.1%) levels. A high level of IL-6 (>10 pg/ml) was observed in all detected patients. The median time from initial symptoms to death was 15 days (IQR 11-20), and a significant association between aspartate aminotransferase (p = 0.002), alanine aminotransferase (p = 0.037) and time from initial symptoms to death was remarkably observed. Older males with comorbidities are more likely to develop severe disease and even die from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Respiratory failure is the main cause of COVID-19, but the virus itself and cytokine release syndrome-mediated damage to other organs, including cardiac, renal, hepatic, and hemorrhagic damage, should be taken seriously as well.","Zhang, Bicheng; Zhou, Xiaoyang; Qiu, Yanru; Song, Yuxiao; Feng, Fan; Feng, Jia; Song, Qibin; Jia, Qingzhu; Wang, Jun",PLoS One,122,24

To mitigate the risk arising from ambiguity of the true utility, we propose a maximin robust model where the optimal policy is based on the worst sequence of utility functions from an ambiguity set constructed with partially available information about the decision maker's preferences. We then show that the multistage maximin problem is time consistent when the utility functions are state-dependent and demonstrate with a counter example that the time consistency may not be retained when the utility functions are state-independent. With the time consistency, we show the maximin problem can be solved by a recursive formula whereby a one-stage maximin problem is solved at each stage beginning from the last stage. Moreover, we propose two approaches to construct the ambiguity set: a pairwise comparison approach and a $\zeta$-ball approach where a ball of utility functions centered at a nominal utility function under $\zeta$-metric is considered. To overcome the difficulty arising from solving the infinite dimensional optimization problem in computation of the worst-case expected utility value, we propose piecewise linear approximation of the utility functions and derive error bound for the approximation under moderate conditions. Finally we develop a scenario tree-based computational scheme for solving the multistage preference robust optimization model and report some preliminary numerical results.","Liu, Jia; Chen, Zhiping; Xu, Huifu",,122,18

Primary care can play a key role in early detection and contention of the disease. There is lack of information on the clinical profile of suspected Covid-19 primary care patients and controversy on the effectiveness of rapid serologic tests in the diagnosis and surveillance of the disease. AIM: To assess the effectiveness of rapid serologic testing in detection and surveillance of Covid-19 cases in primary care. DESIGN AND SETTING: Longitudinal study based on non-random sample of 522 participants including 304 symptomatic patients and 218 high-risk asymptomatic individuals receiving care at four primary health clinics in an underserved area in Santiago. METHOD: Participants were systematically assessed and tested for Covid-19 with RT-PCR and serology at baseline and followed clinically and serologically for a three weeks period. RESULTS: The prevalence rate of RT-PCR confirmed Covid-19 cases was 3.5 times higher in symptomatic patients (27.5% (22.1-32.8; 95% CI) compared to asymptomatic participants (7.9% (4.3-11.6; 95% CI). Similarly, the immune response was significantly different between both groups. Sensitivity of serologic testing was 57.8% (44.8-70.1; 95% CI) during the third week of follow-up and specificity was 98.4% (95.5-99.7; 95% CI). CONCLUSION: Rapid serologic testing is ineffective for detecting asymptomatic or non-severe cases of COVID-19 at early stages of the disease but can be of value for surveillance of immunity response in primary care. The clinical profile and immune response of Covid-19 patients in primary care differ from those in hospital-based populations.","Puschel, Klaus; Ferreccio, Catterina; Peñaloza, Blanca; Abarca, Katia; Rojas, Maria-Paulina; Tellez, Alvaro; Moore, Philippa; Cea, Ana Maria; Wilson, Carlos; Cid, Vicente; Montero, Joaquin",,122,20

Indeed, PHPs are designed to facilitate further stabilization and skill-building before discharge to the community. As a result, our hospital-located in a large metropolitan area in the Northeastern United States-has long maintained a commitment to providing this critical level of care. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, these in-person PHP services were discontinued in response to public health recommendations and to ensure the safety and well-being of patients and staff. To maintain this important point along the psychiatric care continuum, hospital leadership encouraged our PHP team to pursue an alternative approach to treatment delivery: video-based telepsychotherapy. This article describes the development of a virtual PHP that serves acute psychiatric patients stepping down from inpatient hospitalization. First, we provide an overview of the original in-person PHP and then discuss the process of its transition to a virtual format. Next, we describe in detail the components of our newly developed virtual PHP, highlighting adaptations necessitated by patients and staff being remote from our physical hospital. Finally, we present preliminary evidence of our virtual PHP's acceptability and feasibility, based on experiences with our 23 patients to date; discuss lessons learned from this program development effort; and recommend future directions for research and clinical practice.

As the COVID-19 outbreak has spread across the globe, it has brought significant changes to college campuses worldwide. College students have been heavily affected by the closure, as online learning has become increasingly common in higher education institutions. Using data collected from college students in South Korea and Taiwan in the spring of 2020, this study examines the effects of pandemic-related lifestyle changes on mental health conditions for college students in the two countries. The results were 3-fold. First, compared to college students in Taiwan, college students in South Korea reported greater decreases in time spent traveling, being with friends, eating at restaurants, and engaging in part-time employment, and greater increases in online shopping and ordering food for delivery. Second, college students in South Korea reported a higher level of worry, a greater possibility of contact with a person with COVID-19, and a lower level of happiness than did college students in Taiwan. Third, our findings indicate that social activities, including spending time with friends, were positively correlated with mental health conditions in South Korea and Taiwan. Comparing Korean and Taiwanese students' lifestyle changes and mental health conditions amid the pandemic, the study argues that the decrease in socialization and interaction under these new circumstances may be a significant factor that explains an increase in mental health issues in Korean college students compared to Taiwanese students, given the increase in confirmed COVID-19 cases in South Korea and the corresponding greater use of online teaching platforms there than in Taiwan.","Chen, Wei-Lin; Song, Sue-Yeon; Yap, Ko-Hua",Front Public Health,122,24

Since then, the country has reported a total of 4,240,982 cases and 106,544 deaths as of June 30, 2021. This motivates an investigation of the SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics at the national and regional level using case incidence data. Mathematical models are employed to estimate the transmission potential and perform short-term forecasts of the COVID-19 epidemic trajectory in Colombia. Furthermore, geographic heterogeneity of COVID-19 in Colombia is examined along with the analysis of mobility and social media trends, showing that the increase in mobility in July 2020 and January 2021 were correlated with surges in case incidence. The estimation of national and regional reproduction numbers shows sustained disease transmission during the early phase of the pandemic, exhibiting sub-exponential growth dynamics. Moreover, most recent estimates of reproduction number are >1.0 at the national and regional levels as of May 30, 2021. Further, the 30-day ahead short-term forecasts obtained from Richards model present a sustained decline in case counts in contrast to the sub-epidemic and GLM model. Nevertheless, our spatial analysis in Colombia shows distinct variations in incidence rate patterns across different departments that can be grouped into four distinct clusters. Lastly, the correlation of social media trends and adherence to social distancing measures is observed by the fact that a spike in the number of tweets indicating the stay-at-home orders was observed in November 2020 when the case incidence had already plateaued. Author summaryAs the COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread across Colombia, studies highlighting the intensity of the pandemic become imperative for appropriate resource allocation and informing public health policies. In this study we utilize mathematical models to infer the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 at the regional and national level as well as short-term forecast the COVID-19 epidemic trajectory. Moreover, we examine the geographic heterogeneity of the COVID-19 case incidence in Colombia along with the analysis of mobility and social media trends in relation to the observed COVID-19 case incidence in the country. The estimates of reproduction numbers at the national and regional level show sustained disease transmission as of May 30, 2021. Moreover, the 30-day ahead short-term forecasts for the most recent time-period (June 1-June 30, 2021) generated from the mathematical models needs to be interpreted with caution as the Richards model point towards a sustained decline in case incidence contrary to the GLM and sub-epidemic wave model. Nevertheless, the spatial analysis in Colombia shows distinct variations in incidence rate patterns across different departments that can be grouped into four distinct clusters. Lastly, the social media and mobility trends explain the occurrence of case resurgences over the time.","Tariq, Amna; Chakhaia, Tsira; Dahal, Sushma; Ewing, Alexander; Hua, Xinyi; Ofori, Sylvia K.; Prince, Olaseni; Salindri, Argita; Adeniyi, Ayotomiwa Ezekiel; Banda, Juan M.; Skums, Pavel; Luo, Ruiyan; Lara-Diaz, Leidy Y.; Burger, Raimund; Fung, Isaac Chun-Hai; Shim, Eunha; Kirpich, Alexander; Srivastava, Anuj; Chowell, Gerardo",,122,20

Among its treatment sequelae is chronic neuropathic pain after breast surgery (CNPBS). Pain management is difficult and classicaly consists in a pharmacological approach, however recent studies have advocated the use of locoregional techniques as adjuvants. Serratus plane block (SPB) has recently emerged as a potential tool for the control of CNPBS. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and potencial role of the ultrasound-guided SPB on CNPBS. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on 30 patients with CNPBS refractory to drug therapy, who underwent SPB between 2017-2019. The following parameters were analyzed: basal pain, pain at 24 h, 1 week and at 1 month. The Mann-Whitney test was applied. Statistical significance was considered at the level of p < 0.05. All statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 20. RESULTS: 3 patients were excluded. At 24 h, we report pain improvement (at least 30% reduction on basal pain score) on 20 patients and after 1 week on 12. At 1 month after, 22 patients had improved, from these: 11 improved with no therapeutic adjustment; 11 patients improved with therapeutic adjustment (8 in gabapentinoid monotherapy, 3 with introduction of polytherapy). 5 patients didn't improve. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated SPB as a valid alternative for CNPBS management when pharmacologic therapy has been proven insufficient, with no side effects reported. Randomized studies are needed to assess the magnitude of SPB on CNPBS and to identify the patients who benefit the most from SPB.","Dos Santos Rodrigues da Silva, M J; Lousame, A A; Ferreira, M L N; Fernandez Gacio, M; Miranda, M L C",,122,26

Since the current pandemic of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is a great concern for everybody in the World, the frequently asked question is how and when the COVID-19 process will be concluded. The aim of this paper is to propose hypotheses in order to answer this essential question. As recently demonstrated, SARS-CoV-2 RNAs can be reverse-transcribed and integrated into the human genome. Our main hypothesis is that the ultimate aim of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is the incorporation to human genome and being an element of the intestinal virobiota. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We propose that the SARS-CoV-2 genomic incorporation to be a part of human virobiota is essentially based on three pathobiological phases which are called as the ""induction"", ""consolidation"" and ""maintenance phases"". The phase of ""recurrence"" complicate any of these three disease phases based on the viral load, exposure time, and more contagious strains and/or mutants. We have performed the ""Random Walk Model"" in order to predict the community transmission kinetics of the virus. RESULTS: Chimerism-mediated immunotherapy at the individual and community level with the help of vaccination seems to be the only option for ending the COVID-19 process. After the SARS-CoV-2 virus integrated into the human genome via the induction, consolidation and maintenance phases as an element of intestinal virobiota, the chimerism would be concluded. The ""viral load"", the ""genomic strain of the SARS-CoV-2"" and ""host immune reaction against the SARS-CoV-2"" are the hallmarks of this long journey. CONCLUSION: Elucidation of the functional viral dynamics will be helpful for disease management at the individual and community based long-term management strategies.","TÜrk, Seyhan; TÜrk, Can; Malkan, ÜmIt Yavuz; TemIrcI, ElIf Sena; Peker, Mustafa ÇaGri; HaznedaroGlu, IbrahIm CelalettIn",Turkish journal of medical sciences,122,16

However, effective influenza forecasting still remains a challenge despite increasing research interest. It is even more challenging amidst the COVID pandemic, when the influenza-like illness (ILI) counts is affected by various factors such as symptomatic similarities with COVID-19 and shift in healthcare seeking patterns of the general population. We term the ILI values observed when it is potentially affected as COVID-ILI. Under the current pandemic, historical influenza models carry valuable expertise about the disease dynamics but face difficulties adapting. Therefore, we propose CALI-NET, a neural transfer learning architecture which allows us to 'steer' a historical disease forecasting model to new scenarios where flu and COVID co-exist. Our framework enables this adaptation by automatically learning when it is should emphasize learning from COVID-related signals and when from the historical model. In such way, we exploit representations learned from historical ILI data as well as the limited COVID-related signals. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach is successful in adapting a historical forecasting model to the current pandemic. In addition, we show that success in our primary goal, adaptation, does not sacrifice overall performance as compared with state-of-the-art influenza forecasting approaches.","Rodriguez, Alexander; Muralidhar, Nikhil; Adhikari, Bijaya; Tabassum, Anika; Ramakrishnan, Naren; Prakash, B.

In addition to the physical health, economic, and social implications, the psychological impacts of this pandemic are increasingly being reported in the scientific literature. This narrative review reflected on scholarly articles on the epidemiology of mental health problems in COVID-19. The current literature suggests that people affected by COVID-19 may have a high burden of mental health problems, including depression, anxiety disorders, stress, panic attack, irrational anger, impulsivity, somatization disorder, sleep disorders, emotional disturbance, posttraumatic stress symptoms, and suicidal behavior. Moreover, several factors associated with mental health problems in COVID-19 are found, which include age, gender, marital status, education, occupation, income, place of living, close contact with people with COVID-19, comorbid physical and mental health problems, exposure to COVID-19 related news and social media, coping styles, stigma, psychosocial support, health communication, confidence in health services, personal protective measures, risk of contracting COVID-19, and perceived likelihood of survival. Furthermore, the epidemiological distribution of mental health problems and associated factors were heterogeneous among the general public, COVID-19 patients, and healthcare providers. The current evidence suggests that a psychiatric epidemic is cooccurring with the COVID-19 pandemic, which necessitates the attention of the global health community. Future epidemiological studies should emphasize on psychopathological variations and temporality of mental health problems in different populations. Nonetheless, multipronged interventions should be developed and adopted to address the existing psychosocial challenges and promote mental health amid the COVID-19 pandemic.","Hossain, Md Mahbub; Tasnim, Samia; Sultana, Abida; Faizah, Farah; Mazumder, Hoimonty; Zou, Liye; McKyer, E Lisako J; Ahmed, Helal Uddin; Ma, Ping",F1000Res,122,26

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional, household-based serosurvey between October 22, 2020, and November 8, 2020. Participants were interviewed at home and tested for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins in a Luminex based assay. A positive serology was defined as a sample that reacted with both SARS-CoV-2 proteins (100% sensitivity, 99.7% specificity). The overall weighted, age-standardized prevalence was estimated and the infection-to-case ratio was calculated to determine the proportion of undiagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infections. RESULTS: A total of 1233 participants from 292 households were included (mean age, 32.4 years; 764 [61.2%] were women). The overall weighted, age-standardized SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was 16.6% (95% CI 14.0-19.5). The estimated infection-to-case ratio was 292:1.

It was also higher in participants who reported hospitalization than among those who did not (29.8% vs 16.0%, respectively; pË0.05). However, differences were not significant in the multivariate model (p=0.1). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 is much higher than the number of COVID-19 cases reported. These results justify the organization of a sequential series of serosurveys by public health authorities to adapt response measures to the dynamics of the pandemic.","Nkuba, Antoine N; Makiala, Sheila M; Guichet, Emilande; Tshiminyi, Paul M; Bazitama, Yannick M; Yambayamba, Marc K; Kazenza, Benito M; Kabeya, Trésor M; Matungulu, Elysee B; Baketana, Lionel K; Mitongo, Naomi M; Thaurignac, Guillaume; Leendertz, Fabian H; Vanlerberghe, Veerle; Pelloquin, Raphaël; Etard, Jean-François; Maman, David; Mbala, Placide K; Ayouba, Ahidjo; Peeters, Martine; Muyembe, Jean-Jacques T; Delaporte, Eric; Ahuka, Steve M",Clin. infect. dis,122,1

Herein, we introduce a new type of Cas12a reporter, G-triplex (G3), and a highly sensitive biosensor termed G-CRISPR. We proved that Cas12a trans-cleaves G3 structures in about 10 min and G3 can serve as an excellent reporter based on the cleavage-induced high-order structure disruption. G3 reporter improves the analytical sensitivity up to 20 folds, enabling the detection of unamplified and amplified DNA as low as 50 pmol and 0.1 amol (one copy/reaction), respectively. G-CRISPR has been utilized for the analysis of 27 PCR-amplified patient samples with HPV infection risk based on both fluorescence and lateral flow assays, resulting in 100% concordance between the two. In comparison with the clinical results, it achieved overall specificity and sensitivity of 100% and 94.7%, respectively. These results suggest that G-CRISPR can serve as a rapid, sensitive, and reliable biosensor, and could further expand the CRISPR toolbox in biomedical diagnostics.","Li, Tao; Hu, Rui; Xia, Jianbo; Xu, Zhichen; Chen, Dongjuan; Xi, Jinou; Liu, Bi-Feng; Zhu, Jiang; Li, Ying; Yang, Yunhuang; Liu, Maili",Biosens Bioelectron,122,25

METHODS: This is a retrospective study of 9 lesions of 8 patients with histopathologically proven PEH RESULTS: Mean age at diagnosis of PEH was 31 years (median 31 years; range 12 to 62 years). The lesion was unilateral in 7 (88%) patients and bilateral in one (12%). Two patients (25%) had xeroderma pigmentosum, who also had a history of prior surgical intervention in the same eye for conjunctival tumor excision. Referral diagnosis was ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN) in all cases. Ocular surface mass (n = 4, 44%) was the most common presenting complaint. The mean duration of symptoms was 18 months (median 3 months; range < 1 to 84 months). All lesions were perilimbal, and the mean basal diameter of the tumor was 7 mm (median 6 mm; range 4 to 12 mm). Clinical diagnosis included OSSN (n = 5; 56%), PEH (n = 3; 33%), or leiomyosarcoma (n = 1; 11%). AS-OCT features included irregular hyperreflective epithelium, epithelial dipping, and subepithelial hyperreflective lesion with posterior shadowing in all cases. Histopathology confirmed the diagnosis of PEH in all cases. The underlying cause of PEH in these cases included vernal keratoconjunctivitis (n = 4; 44%), idiopathic severe blepharitis (n = 2; 22%), or prior surgical intervention (n = 2; 22%). No apparent cause could be determined in one eye (11%). CONCLUSION: Ocular surface PEH is a close mimicker of OSSN. Careful history-taking, clinical examination, and characteristic AS-OCT features aid in accurate diagnosis.","Kaliki, Swathi; Maniar, Arpita; Jakati, Saumya; Mishra, Dilip K",Int. ophthalmol,122,26

Twitter is one of the social media microblogging platforms used by individual investors to share their opinion and get information. This study aims to determine whether microblogging sentiment investors can predict the capital market during pandemics. To analyze microblogging sentiment investors, we classified sentiment using the phyton text mining algorithm and Naive Bayesian text classification into level positive, negative, and neutral from November 2019 to November 2020. This study was on 68 listed companies on the Indonesia stock exchange. A Vector Autoregression and Impulse Response is applied to capture short and long-term impacts along with a causal relationship. We found that microblogging sentiment investor has a significant impact on stock returns and volatility and vice-versa. Also, the response due to shocks is convergent, and microblogging investors in Indonesia are categorized as a ""news-watcher"" investor.","Fariska, P.; Nugraha, N.; Putera, I.; Rohandi, M. M.

In a metanalysis, Mealer et al (2009) and others reported that how one copes with these emotions and stressful conditions may affect the quality of healthcare provided to others, and the well-being of the people they care about both within and outside of their work environment. The recent emergence of more highly infective mutations of SARS-CoV-2 [COVID-19], identified as SARS-CoV-2 VUI 202012/01 in the USA with a reportedly 50-70% greater contagious potential than the novel strain has sparked great concern throughout Europe, the United Kingdom and the USA, resulting in both International and Domestic travel limitations attempts to slow the continued spread of the coronavirus pandemic in attempts to contain the mutations, albeit it unsuccessful so far. PTSD and other mental health disorders may develop in individuals following exposure to a traumatic event or ongoing circumstances as has occurred among healthcare workers in the current pandemic as well as among returning combat veterans and disaster stricken regions and may be a precipitating cause of PTSD among HCPs and may contribute to their symptoms following prolonged exposure to their seemingly unending and highly stressful patient care responsibilities, and which symptoms may escape observation by others similarly affected in the treatment chain. The results of this metanalysis study indicate that according to Tang et al (2017), healthcare providers that were exposed to Avian Influenza virus (H7N9) patients were significantly prone (p=&lt;0.05) to developing severe anxiety, PTSD stress and burnout symptoms, indicating a need for greater pre-exposure training in traumatic illness stress management to better prepare them for early-stage career management, particularly during the early stages of their careers. The recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 VUI 202012/01 and more recent variants, potentially 50% or more contagious strains of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with as yet unknown risks for morbidity and mortality particularly among smokers may pose such a threat among the general population and the among the HCP who may be tasked for their healthcare, wellbeing, and all to often, palliative supportive care, despite the best efforts of epidemiologic surveillance and containment via application of conventional public health measures and available resources.

METHODS: Pregnant women with COVID-19 infection were identified at two affiliated hospitals in New York City from March 13 to April 19, 2020, for this case series study. Women were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection based on either universal testing on admission or testing because of COVID-19-related symptoms. Disease was classified as either 1) asymptomatic or mild or 2) moderate or severe based on dyspnea, tachypnea, or hypoxia. Clinical and demographic risk factors for moderate or severe disease were analyzed and calculated as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs. Laboratory findings and associated symptoms were compared between those with mild or asymptomatic and moderate or severe disease. The clinical courses and associated complications of women hospitalized with moderate and severe disease are described. RESULTS: Of 158 pregnant women with COVID-19 infection, 124 (78%) had mild or asymptomatic disease and 34 (22%) had moderate or severe disease. Of 15 hospitalized women with moderate or severe disease, 10 received respiratory support with supplemental oxygen and one required intubation. Women with moderate or severe disease had a higher likelihood of having an underlying medical comorbidity (50% vs 27%, OR 2.76, 95% CI 1.26-6.02). Asthma was more common among those with moderate or severe disease (24% vs 8%, OR 3.51, 95% CI 1.26-9.75). Women with moderate or severe disease were significantly more likely to have leukopenia and elevated aspartate transaminase and ferritin. Women with moderate or severe disease were at significantly higher risk for cough and chest pain and pressure. Nine women received ICU or step-down-level care, including four for 9 days or longer. Two women underwent preterm delivery because their clinical status deteriorated. CONCLUSION: One in five pregnant women who contracted COVID-19 infection developed moderate or severe disease, including a small proportion with prolonged critical illness who received ICU or step-down-level care.","Andrikopoulou, Maria; Madden, Nigel; Wen, Timothy; Aubey, Janice J; Aziz, Aleha; Baptiste, Caitlin D; Breslin, Noelle; DÊ¼Alton, Mary E; Fuchs, Karin M; Goffman, Dena; Gyamfi-Bannerman, Cynthia; Matseoane-Peterssen, Dara N; Miller, Russell S; Sheen, Jean-Ju; Simpson, Lynn L; Sutton, Desmond; Zork, Noelia; Friedman, Alexander M",Obstet Gynecol,122,33

METHODS: Participants were 122 adolescents (ages 15-17; 61% male; 48% with ADHD). Parents reported on adolescents' sleep duration and difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep (DIMS); adolescents reported on sleep patterns, sleep duration, delayed sleep/wake behaviors, and daytime sleepiness before (September 2019-February 2020) and during (May-June 2020) COVID-19. Adolescents also reported on their health behaviors, COVID-19-related negative affect, and difficulties concentrating due to COVID-19. RESULTS: Parents reported adolescents had more DIMS during COVID-19 than before COVID-19, with clinically-elevated rates increasing from 24% to 36%. Both bedtimes and waketimes shifted later during COVID-19, and adolescents reported more delayed sleep/wake behaviors. Adolescents also reported less daytime sleepiness and longer school night sleep duration during COVID-19. In considering differences between adolescents with and without ADHD, adolescents with ADHD did not experience an increase in school night sleep duration and were less likely to obtain recommended sleep duration during COVID-19. In the full sample, controlling for ADHD status, COVID-19-related sadness/loneliness was associated with increases in DIMS, and spending less time outside and more COVID-19-related worries/fears were associated with increases in delayed sleep/wake behaviors during COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 had negative and positive impacts on adolescent sleep. Adolescents with ADHD did not experience the benefit of increased school night sleep duration during COVID-19 like adolescents without ADHD.

Here, we systematically explored the nanomechanical properties of a range of Gram-negative bacteria (Salmonella, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) with different degrees of ß-lactam resistance. Our observations indicated that the BLR bacteria had cell stiffness values almost 10× lower than that of ß-lactam-susceptible bacteria, caused by reduced peptidoglycan biosynthesis. With the aid of numerical modeling and experimental measurements, we demonstrated that these stiffness findings can be used to develop programmable, stiffness-mediated antimicrobial nanowires that mechanically penetrate the BLR bacterial cell envelope. We anticipate that these stiffness-related findings will aid in the discovery and development of novel treatment strategies for BLR Gram-negative bacterial infections.","Liu, Lizhi; Chen, Sheng; Zhang, Xu; Xue, Zhenjie; Cui, Shengjie; Hua, Xiaoting; Yang, Baowei; Yan, Huiling; Liu, Cong; Wang, Jing; Zhang, Zengfeng; Yu, Wei; Wu, Fan; Xu, Wujun; Lehto, Vesa-Pekka; Yue, Tianli; Liu, Yan; Yu, Yunsong; Wang, Tie; Wang, Jianlong",Sci.

Characterizing these assays provides scientific basis to best use them. The current study assessed one chemiluminescent assay (Abbott COVID-2 IgG) and two lateral flow assays (STANDARD Q [SQ] IgM/IgG Duo and Wondfo total antibody test) using 113 blood samples from 71 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 hospitalized patients, 119 samples with potential cross-reactions, and 1068 negative controls including 942 pre-pandemic samples. SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibodies became detectable 3-4 days post-symptom onset using SQ IgM test and IgG antibodies were first detected 5-6 days post-onset using SQ IgG. Abbott IgG and Wondfo Total were able to detect antibodies 7 to 8 days post-onset. After 14 days post-symptom onset, the SQ IgG, Abbott IgG and Wondfo Total tests were able to detect antibodies from 100% of the PCR-confirmed patients in this series; 87.5% sensitivity for SQ IgM. Overall agreement was 88.5% between SQ IgM/IgG and Wondfo Total and 94.6% between SQ IgG and Abbott IgG. No cross-reaction due to recent sera with three of the endemic coronaviruses was observed. Viral hepatitis and autoimmune samples were the main source of limited cross-reactions. The specificities were 100% for SQ IgG and Wondfo Total, 99.62% for Abbott IgG, and 98.87% for SQ IgM. These findings demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity of appropriately validated SARS-CoV-2 serologic assays with implications for clinical use and epidemiological seroprevalence studies.","Paiva, Kimberly J; Grisson, Ricky D; Chan, Philip A; Huard, Richard C; Caliendo, Angela M; Lonks, John R; King, Ewa; Tang, Eric W; Pytel-Parenteau, Diane L; Nam, Ga H; Yakirevich, Evgeny; Lu, Shaolei",J. med. virol,122,16

This question has now risen to national prominence as policymakers consider ways to help support students catch up lost learning after the COVID-19 pandemic. This article explores the relationship between instruction time on General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) attainment and value-added scores for 2,815 English secondary schools using panel data from the 2010–14 School Workforce Census. Robust estimates suggest that instruction time has a small effect on attainment in each of English, mathematics, science and humanities. Based on sub-group analysis, effects sizes are also estimated for students with varying prior achievement and for those in receipt of free school meals. These too appear small, suggesting, vis-à-vis instructional time, sometimes less might be more. © 2021 Connolly.","Connolly, V.",London Review of Education,122,16

Socio-spatial inequality is defined as a process and structural condition of a territory marked by inherited and updated vulnerabilities, resulting from a relationship of exploitation, spoliation, and oppression in the current period of globalization. The authors argue that the COVID-19 pandemic can have more serious repercussions in contexts of greater socio-spatial inequality, with systemic and chronic deepening of the economic and social crises in places. Still, actions matter, including collaboration between different groups, institutions, and sectors. The analysis of geographic situation contributes to understanding the inherited territory and different experiences with COVID-19, inextricably linked to the conditions and meanings of action in the face of the pandemic in each place. Geographic situation expresses the tension between freedom and the condition for action. The crisis is not only a health crisis, but a manifestation of the current time, and inequality proves to be the most serious emergency of the 21st century.","Albuquerque, Mariana Vercesi de; Ribeiro, Luis Henrique Leandro",Cad Saude Publica,122,24

One of the most significant task in this pandemic is to accurately and efficiently diagnose the COVID-19 patients and to monitor them to make prompt decisions and take appropriate actions for their monitoring, management and treatment. The early diagnosis of COVID-19 was a very troublesome and difficult challenge that CAD (Computer-Aided Diagnosis) methods successfully tackled. The CXR (chest X-ray) method proved to be a very low-cost and effective alternative to Computed Tomography (CT) scan and Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test, which were previously the most commonly used methods for COVID-19 diagnosis. Till now, very few CAD based techniques have been proposed to effectively detect COVID-19, but their efficiency is limited due to a number of factors. In this study, we have proposed a deep learning model using the Convolutional Block Attention Module with ResNet32. For training the model, Kaggle's dataset containing CXR images has been used. The dataset contains a total of 3886 images. Moreover, 64% of data has been used for training, 20% for testing and 16% for validation. We have experimented with different CNN architectures with different approaches like Transfer Learning, Data Augmentation and attention module. With 97.69% accuracy, the ResNet32 with attention module outperformed other architectures and approaches, improving the baseline network efficiency. This promising and efficient classification accomplishment of our proposed methodology demonstrates that it is well suited for CXR image classification in COVID-19 diagnosis in terms of both accuracy and cost. © 2021 IEEE.","Nawshad, M.

Nurses face risks of life-threatening infection, which can create psychological distress. Quality of care for infected patients depends on mental well-being of nurses which calls for research on predictors of stress among health care workers. Responding to a call for research on the effects of leadership styles on psychological distress during traumatic events, this paper uses the theoretical lens of social exchange theory and contributes to literature on relationships between inclusive leadership, psychological distress, work engagement, and self-sacrifice. Participants of this cross sectional study included 497 registered nurses from five hospitals in Wuhan. Data were collected with temporal separation through an online questionnaire. Partial least-squares structural equation modeling was used to analyze data. Results show inclusive leadership has a significant negative relationship with psychological distress. Work engagement mediates this relationship, and nurses’ self-sacrificial behavior moderates it. Findings indicate inclusive leadership style serves as a sustainable mechanism to reduce psychological distress during pandemics. It can operationalize the delivery of mental health support in real-time in work settings. Results provide empirical support for social exchange theory through high work engagement to help control psychological distress among nurses.","Ahmed, Fawad; Zhao, Fuqiang; Faraz, Naveed Ahmad",Front.

Here, we report for the first time that the 11S proteasomal activator PA28Î³ regulates the intracellular abundance of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein (nCoV N). Furthermore, we have identified proteasome activator PA28Î³ as a nCoV N binding protein by co-immunoprecipitation assay. As a result of their interaction, nCoV N could be degraded by PA28Î³-20S in vitro degradation assay. This was also demonstrated by blocking de novo protein synthesis with cycloheximide. The stability of nCoV N in PA28Î³-knockout cells was greater than in PA28Î³-wildtype cells. Notably, immunofluorescence staining revealed that knockout of the PA28Î³ gene in cells led to the transport of nCoV N from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Overexpression of PA28Î³ enhanced proteolysis of nCoV N compared to that in PA28Î³-N151Y cells containing a dominant-negative PA28Î³ mutation, which reduced this process. These results suggest that PA28Î³ binding is important in regulating 20S proteasome activity, which in turn regulates levels of the critical nCoV N nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2, furthering our understanding of the pathogenesis of COVID-19.","Zhang, Haiyang; Tu, Jialu; Cao, Chulei; Yang, Ting; Gao, Liangcai",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,122,16

SARS-CoV-2 is known to use its spike glycoprotein to interact with the cell surface as a first step in the infection process. As for other coronaviruses, it is likely that SARS-CoV-2 next undergoes endocytosis, but whether or not this is required for infectivity and the precise endocytic mechanism used are unknown. Using purified spike glycoprotein and lentivirus pseudotyped with spike glycoprotein, a common model of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, we now demonstrate that after engagement with the plasma membrane, SARS-CoV-2 undergoes rapid, clathrin-mediated endocytosis. This suggests that transfer of viral RNA to the cell cytosol occurs from the lumen of the endosomal system. Importantly, we further demonstrate that knockdown of clathrin heavy chain, which blocks clathrin-mediated endocytosis, reduces viral infectivity. These discoveries reveal that SARS-CoV-2 uses clathrin-mediated endocytosis to gain access into cells and suggests that this process is a key aspect of virus infectivity.","Bayati, Armin; Kumar, Rahul; Francis, Vincent; McPherson, Peter S",J Biol Chem,122,21

METHODS: Our article comprehensively searched PubMed, FMRS, EMbase, CNKI, WanFang databases, and VIP databases to collect literatures about the CT imaging features of COVID-19 from 1 January to 16 March 2020. Three reviewers independently screened literature, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias of included studies, and then, this meta-analysis was performed by using Stata12.0 software. RESULTS: A total of 34 retrospective studies involving a total of 4121 patients with COVID-19 were included. The results of the meta-analysis showed that most patients presented bilateral lung involvement (73.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 65.9%-81.1%) or multilobar involvement (67.3%, 95% CI: 54.8%-78.7%) and just little patients showed normal CT findings (8.4%). We found that the most common changes in lesion density were ground-glass opacities (68.1%, 95% CI: 56.9%-78.2%). Other changes in density included air bronchogram sign (44.7%), crazy-paving pattern (35.6%), and consolidation (32.0%). Patchy (40.3%), spider web sign (39.5%), cord-like (36.8%), and nodular (20.5%) were common lesion shapes in patients with COVID-19. Pleural thickening (27.1%) was found in some patients. Lymphadenopathy (5.4%) and pleural effusion (5.3%) were rare. CONCLUSION: The lung lesions of patients with COVID-19 were mostly bilateral lungs or multilobar involved.

Kentucky has poor health outcomes and limited broadband connectivity. Given these and other practice-specific constraints, the region serves as a unique context to explore the efficacy of telehealth in cardiology. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine the limitations of telehealth accessibility, patient satisfaction with telehealth relative to in-person visits, and the perceived advantages and disadvantages to telehealth. Our intent was two-fold. First, we wanted to conduct a rapid postassessment of the mandated overhaul of the health care delivery system, focusing on a representative specialty field, and how it was affecting patients. Second, we intend to use our findings to make suggestions about the future application of a telehealth model in specialty fields such as cardiology. METHODS: We constructed an online survey in Qualtrics following the Patient Assessment of Communication During Telemedicine, a patient self-report questionnaire that has been previously developed and validated. We invited all patients who had a visit scheduled during the COVID-19 telehealth-only time frame to participate. Questions included factors for declining telehealth, patient satisfaction ratings of telehealth and in-person visits, and perceived advantages and disadvantages associated with telehealth. We also used electronic medical records to collect no-show data for in-person versus telehealth visits to check for nonresponse bias. RESULTS: A total of 224 respondents began our survey (11% of our sample of 2019 patients). Our recruitment rate was 86% (n=193) and our completion rate was 62% (n=120). The no-show rate for telehealth visits (345/2019, 17%) was nearly identical to the typical no-show rate for in-person appointments. Among the 32 respondents who declined a telehealth visit, 20 (63%) cited not being aware of their appointment as a primary factor, and 15 (47%) respondents cited their opinion that a telehealth appointment was not medically necessary as at least somewhat of a factor in their decision. Both in-person and telehealth were viewed favorably, but in-person was rated higher across all domains of patient satisfaction. The only significantly lower mean score for telehealth (3.7 vs 4.2, P=.007) was in the clinical competence domain. Reduced travel time, lower visit wait time, and cost savings were seen as big advantages. Poor internet connectivity was rated as at least somewhat of a factor by 33.0% (35/106) of respondents. CONCLUSIONS: This study takes advantage of the natural experiment provided by the COVID-19 pandemic to assess the efficacy of telehealth in cardiology. Patterns of satisfaction are consistent across modalities and show that telehealth appears to be a viable alternative to in-person appointments. However, we found evidence that scheduling of telehealth visits may be problematic and needs additional attention. Additionally, we include a note of caution that patient satisfaction with telehealth may be artificially inflated during COVID-19 due to external health concerns connected with in-person visits.","Singh, Aniruddha; Mountjoy, Natalie; McElroy, Doug; Mittal, Shilpi; Al Hemyari, Bashar; Coffey, Nicholas; Miller, Kristen; Gaines, Kenneth",JMIR Cardio,122,24

Yet, current methods for screening these two issues rely on in-person interviews, which can be expensive, time-consuming, and blocked by social stigma and quarantines. Meanwhile, how individuals engage with online platforms such as Google Search and YouTube has undergone drastic shifts due to COVID-19 and subsequent lockdowns. Such ubiquitous daily behaviors on online platforms have the potential to capture and correlate with clinically alarming deteriorations in depression and anxiety profiles of users in a noninvasive manner. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to examine, among college students in the United States, the relationships of deteriorating depression and anxiety conditions with the changes in user behaviors when engaging with Google Search and YouTube during COVID-19. METHODS: This study recruited a cohort of undergraduate students (N=49) from a US college campus during January 2020 (prior to the pandemic) and measured the anxiety and depression levels of each participant. The anxiety level was assessed via the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7). The depression level was assessed via the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). This study followed up with the same cohort during May 2020 (during the pandemic), and the anxiety and depression levels were assessed again. The longitudinal Google Search and YouTube history data of all participants were anonymized and collected. From individual-level Google Search and YouTube histories, we developed 5 features that can quantify shifts in online behaviors during the pandemic. We then assessed the correlations of deteriorating depression and anxiety profiles with each of these features. We finally demonstrated the feasibility of using the proposed features to build predictive machine learning models. RESULTS: Of the 49 participants, 49% (n=24) of them reported an increase in the PHQ-9 depression scores; 53% (n=26) of them reported an increase in the GAD-7 anxiety scores. The results showed that a number of online behavior features were significantly correlated with deteriorations in the PHQ-9 scores (r ranging between -0.37 and 0.75, all P values less than or equal to .03) and the GAD-7 scores (r ranging between -0.47 and 0.74, all P values less than or equal to .03). Simple machine learning models were shown to be useful in predicting the change in anxiety and depression scores (mean squared error ranging between 2.37 and 4.22, R2 ranging between 0.68 and 0.84) with the proposed features. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggested that deteriorating depression and anxiety conditions have strong correlations with behavioral changes in Google Search and YouTube use during the COVID-19 pandemic. Though further studies are required, our results demonstrate the feasibility of using pervasive online data to establish noninvasive surveillance systems for mental health conditions that bypasses many disadvantages of existing screening methods.","Zhang, Boyu; Zaman, Anis; Silenzio, Vincent; Kautz, Henry; Hoque, Ehsan",JMIR Ment Health,122,1

METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, short text message invite surveys were sent to 870 oral health care providers in west part of Iran. Data were collected through validated self-report EPPM questionnaires. Descriptive statistics, Chi-square and Fishers exact tests were used for data analysis. RESULTS: In total, 300 completed questionnaires were received and the mean age of respondents was 29.89 ± 11.17 years (range: 20-75 years). Among the study population, 284 (94.67%) perceived the threat of infection highly. Washing hands frequently with water and soap and use of hand sanitizer was reported by 93.33%, of participants. Age (P = 0.010), sex (P = 0.002) and occupation field (P = 0.010) were significantly associated with danger control responses. Data identified that those oral health care providers that were on the danger control response adopted preventive behaviors more strictly than those on fear control response. CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed how degrees of perceived threat and perceived efficacy influenced oral health providers' willingness to perform recommended health behaviors. These findings can assist public health agencies in developing educational programs specifically designed for promoting preventive behaviors among oral health providers in pandemic situations.","Shirahmadi, Samane; Seyedzadeh-Sabounchi, Shabnam; Khazaei, Salman; Bashirian, Saeid; Miresmæili, Amir Farhang; Bayat, Zeinab; Houshmand, Behzad; Semyari, Hasan; Barati, Majid; Jenabi, Ensiyeh; Heidarian, Fakhreddin; Zareian, Sepideh; Kheirandish, Mohammad; Dadae, Neda",PLoS One,122,15

Such cases may provide unique insight into brain regions responsible for mania symptoms and identify therapeutic targets.METHODSLesion locations associated with mania were identified using a systematic literature search (n = 41) and mapped onto a common brain atlas. The network of brain regions functionally connected to each lesion location was computed using normative human connectome data (resting-state functional MRI, n = 1000) and contrasted with those obtained from lesion locations not associated with mania (n = 79). Reproducibility was assessed using independent cohorts of mania lesions derived from clinical chart review (n = 15) and of control lesions (n = 490). Results were compared with brain stimulation sites previously reported to induce or relieve mania symptoms.RESULTSLesion locations associated with mania were heterogeneous and no single brain region was lesioned in all, or even most, cases. However, these lesion locations showed a unique pattern of functional connectivity to the right orbitofrontal cortex, right inferior temporal gyrus, and right frontal pole. This connectivity profile was reproducible across independent lesion cohorts and aligned with the effects of therapeutic brain stimulation on mania symptoms.CONCLUSIONSBrain lesions associated with mania are characterized by a specific pattern of brain connectivity that lends insight into localization of mania symptoms and potential therapeutic targets.FUNDINGFundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia (FCT), Harvard Medical School DuPont-Warren Fellowship, Portuguese national funds from FCT and Fundo Europeu de Desenvolvimento Regional, Child Neurology Foundation Shields Research, Sidney R.

However, it is unclear whether the association between hepatic dysfunction and lactate clearance can act as a prognostic marker of clinical outcomes in patients with septic shock. We aimed to evaluate the association between lactate clearance and mortality in two cohorts of septic shock patient who had hepatic dysfunction based on their total serum bilirubin levels (TBIL). Lactate clearance at 24 h after the onset of septic shock was analyzed using two cohorts, sub-categorized into two groups based on TBIL: < 2 mg/dL and &#8805; 2 mg/dL. In the derivation cohort, lactate clearance was lower in non-survivors than in survivors with TBIL &#8805; 2 mg/dL, while there was no significant difference in lactate clearance between non-survivors and survivors with TBIL < 2 mg/dL. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that increased lactate clearance was significantly associated with decreased 28-day mortality in the TBIL &#8805; 2 mg/dL group (10% lactate clearance, adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.80-0.97, P = 0.0075), Creatinine level &#8805; 2 mg/dL group (adjusted OR: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.81-0.95, P = 0.00069) and APACHE II score &#8805; 35 group (adjusted OR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.87-0.98, P = 0.013). In the validation cohort, lactate clearance was lower in non-survivors than in survivors with TBIL &#8805; 2 mg/dL, while no significant difference in lactate clearance was observed between non-survivors and survivors with TBIL < 2 mg/dL. Increased lactate clearance was significantly associated with decreased 28-day mortality in the TBIL &#8805; 2 mg/dL group (10% lactate clearance, adjusted OR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.83-0.96, P = 0.0038) and the association was just about significant in APACHE II score &#8805; 35 group (adjusted OR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.74-1.00, P = 0.051).

Vitamin D plays an important role in immune function and inflammation. This systematic review and meta-analysis assesses the impact of vitamin D status and supplementation on COVID-19 related mortality and health outcomes. METHODS: We searched four databases until December 18th 2020, and trial registries until January 20th 2021. Two reviewers screened the studies, collected data, assessed the risk of bias, and graded the evidence for each outcome across studies, independently and in duplicate. Pre-specified outcomes of interest were mortality, ICU admission, invasive and non-invasive ventilation, hospitalization, time of hospital stay, disease severity and SARS-CoV-2 positivity. We only included data from peer-reviewed articles in our primary analyses. RESULTS: We identified 31 peer-reviewed observational studies. In our primary analysis, there was a positive trend between serum 25(OH)D level <20â¯ng/ml and an increased risk of mortality, ICU admission, invasive ventilation, non-invasive ventilation or SARS-CoV-2 positivity. However, these associations were not statistically significant. Mean 25(OH)D levels was 5.9â¯ng/ml (95% CI [-9.5, -2.3]) significantly lower in COVID-19 positive, compared to negative patients. The certainty of the evidence was very low. We identified 32 clinical trial protocols, but only three have published results to-date. The trials administer vitamin D doses of 357 to 60,000â¯IU/day, from one week to 12â¯months. Eight megatrials investigate the efficacy of vitamin D in outpatient populations. A pilot trial revealed a significant decrease in ICU admission with calcifediol, compared to placebo (ORâ¯=â¯0.003), but the certainty of the evidence was unclear. Another small trial showed that supplementation with cholecalciferol, 60,000â¯IU/day, decreased fibrinogen levels, but did not have an effect on D-dimer, procalcitonin and CRP levels, compared to placebo. The third trial did not find any effect of vitamin D supplementation on COVID-19 related health outcomes. CONCLUSION: While the available evidence to-date, from largely poor-quality observational studies, may be viewed as showing a trend for an association between low serum 25(OH)D levels and COVID-19 related health outcomes, this relationship was not found to be statistically significant. Calcifediol supplementation may have a protective effect on COVID-19 related ICU admissions. The current use of high doses of vitamin D in COVID-19 patients is not based on solid evidence. It awaits results from ongoing trials to determine the efficacy, desirable doses, and safety, of vitamin D supplementation to prevent and treat COVID-19 related health outcomes.","Bassatne, Aya; Basbous, Maya; Chakhtoura, Marlene; El Zein, Ola; Rahme, Maya; El-Hajj Fuleihan, Ghada",Metabolism,122,33

METHODS: Hospitalized DM patients with and without malignancy were characterized and compared using 2009-2015 National Inpatient Sample. Associated malignancies, risk factors for malignancy, and trends/predictors for cost of care and length of stay were evaluated using multivariable models. RESULTS: Prevalence of malignancies among hospitalized DM inpatients was 10.9%. Age > 40 years and female sex were significantly associated with increased malignancy risk in DM inpatients. Numerous malignancies were significantly more common in men with DM compared to women, including bronchial, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, head/neck, bladder, esophageal, kidney, and stomach. The most common malignancies in women with DM were breast and ovarian. Head/neck carcinomas were more common in hospitalized DM patients than previous cohorts evaluating outpatients. Socioeconomic characteristics differed between DM patients with/without malignancy. The presence of underlying malignancy did not affect hospitalization cost, length of stay, or mortality in the hospitalized DM population. The economic burden of hospitalized DM patients is increasing over time. CONCLUSIONS: DM inpatients with malignancy display numerous differences compared to DM inpatients without malignancy. Further research characterizing hospitalized DM patients is warranted in order to optimize work-up and treatment guidelines for these patients.","Tripathi, Raghav; Fernandez, Anthony P",Arch. dermatol. res,122,22

Motivated by the ongoing global coronavirus pandemic, the article provides an overview of scientific evidence regarding adverse impact of diverse human disasters on mental health in afflicted groups and societies. Following this broader context, psychosocial impact of COVID-19 as a specific global human disaster is presented, with an emphasis on disturbing mental health aspects of the ongoing pandemic. Limited resources of mental health services in a number of countries around the world are illustrated, which will be further stretched by the forthcoming increase in demand for mental health services due to the global COVID-19 pandemic. Mental health challenges are particularly important for the Republic of Croatia in the current situation, due to disturbing stress of the 2020 Zagreb earthquake and the high pre-pandemic prevalence of chronic Homeland-War-related posttraumatic stress disorders. Comprehensive approach based on digital psychiatry is proposed to address the lack of access to psychiatric services, which includes artificial intelligence, telepsychiatry and an array of new technologies, like internet-based computer-aided mental health tools and services. These tools and means should be utilized as an important part of the whole package of measures to mitigate negative mental health effects of the global coronavirus pandemic. Our scientific and engineering experiences in the design and development of digital tools and means in mitigation of stress-related disorders and assessment of stress resilience are presented. Croatian initiative on enhancement of interdisciplinary research of psychiatrists, psychologists and computer scientists on the national and EU level is important in addressing pressing mental health concerns related to the ongoing pandemic and similar human disasters.","Cosic, Kresimir; Popovic, Sinisa; Sarlija, Marko; Kesedzic, Ivan",Psychiatr Danub,122,16

However, such events could be explained by different scenarios such as intermittent viral shedding, bonafide re-infection or multiple infection with alternating predominance of different viruses. Analysis of minor variants is an important tool to distinguish between these scenarios. Using ARTIC network PCR amplification and next-generation sequencing, we obtained SARS-CoV-2 sequences from two timepoints (with a time span of 102 days) of a patient followed at the Brazilian National Cancer Institute. Within-host variant analysis evidenced three single nucleotide variants (SNVs) at the consensus viral sequence in the second timepoint that were already present in the first timepoint as minor variants. Another five SNVs found in the second timepoint were not detected in the first sample sequenced, suggesting an additional infection by a yet another new virus. Our observation shed light into the existence of different viral populations that are present in dynamic frequencies and fluctuate during the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The detection of these variants in distinct disease events of an individual highlights a complex interplay between viral reactivation from a pre-existing minority variant and reinfection by a different virus.","Siqueira, Juliana D; Goes, Livia R; Alves, Brunna M; da Silva, Ana Carla P; de Carvalho, Pedro S; Cicala, Claudia; Arthos, James; Viola, João P B; Soares, Marcelo A",Infect Genet Evol,122,20

A point of departure of our analysis from the literature is that we take into account the dynamic and lagged interactions between the fractional changes in market arrivals and prices of food commodities, namely, rice, onion, potato, and tomato, and the growth rate in the severity ratio of the Covid-19 pandemic, using a panel VAR model based on the GMM. Our results suggest that there was virtually no effect of the Covid-19 pandemic growth on fractional changes in market arrivals while the former negatively influences fractional food price changes in the short run. However, once we consider feedback effects in the VAR model based on Impulse Response Functions, the overall elasticity of the fractional change in the market arrival with respect to the Covid-19 pandemic growth turns from weakly positive to zero in a relatively short term. The overall elasticity of the fractional change in the market price with respect to the Covid-19 pandemic growth turns from positive to zero or negative in onion and tomato, and from negative to zero in rice and potato. We also find a great deal of regional heterogeneity where, for instance, the negative effect of the pandemic growth on the fractional change in price is larger in Maharashtra, the state with the worst pandemic. While the effect of the pandemic growth is relatively short-lived, policymakers need to take into account dynamic effects over time given the complexity of the transmission mechanism.","Imai, K.

The field of algorithmic contact tracing, in particular, an area of research that had previously received limited attention, has moved into the spotlight as a crucial factor in containing the pandemic. The use of digital tools to enable more robust and expedited contact tracing and notification, while maintaining privacy and trust in the data generated, is viewed as key to identifying chains of transmission and close contacts, and, consequently, to enabling effective case investigations. Scaling these tools has never been more critical, as global case numbers have exceeded 100 million, as many asymptomatic patients remain undetected, and as COVID-19 variants begin to emerge around the world. In this context, there is increasing attention on blockchain technology as a part of systems for enhanced digital algorithmic contact tracing and reporting. By analyzing the literature that has emerged from this trend, the common characteristics of the designs proposed become apparent. An archetypal system architecture can be derived, taking these characteristics into consideration. However, assessing the utility of this architecture using a recognized evaluation framework shows that the added benefits and features of blockchain technology do not provide significant advantages over conventional centralized systems for algorithmic contact tracing and reporting. From our study, it, therefore, seems that blockchain technology may provide a more significant benefit in other areas of public health beyond contact tracing.","Platt, Moritz; Hasselgren, Anton; Román-Belmonte, Juan Manuel; Tuler de Oliveira, Marcela; De la Corte-Rodríguez, Hortensia; Delgado Olabarriaga, Sílvia; Rodríguez-Merchán, E Carlos; Mackey, Tim Ken",JMIR Public Health Surveill,122,1

METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of a pediatric kidney transplant population at a New York transplant center. Baseline characteristics and clinical course of patients with SARS-CoV-2 positivity (Ab or PCR) were described, and comparison between COVID-positive and COVID-negative transplant patients was performed. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients had COVID-19 IgG testing performed, eight of whom also had PCR testing. 23% of our cohort had evidence of COVID-19 infection. Four patients had positive IgG only, and one patient had a positive PCR. All five patients with a positive COVID test were female. Two patients had COVID-19 symptoms, which were mild. Of the symptomatic patients, one had a positive PCR at time of symptoms, while the other had a negative PCR during symptoms but subsequently had positive IgG. As compared to patients with COVID-19 negative results, those with COVID-19 positivity were significantly more likely to have a known COVID-19 exposure, and were also more likely to be female. There was no significant difference in time from transplant between the groups. Those in the COVID-positive group had higher baseline antimetabolite dose and CNI troughs, although these did not reach statistical significance.

As a result, some patients have self-reported getting a boost with BNT. Therefore, this study aimed to compare SARS-CoV-2 spike 1-2 IgG antibodies in plasma samples between two groups: one group immunized with Ad5-nCoV and another with a heterologous vaccination regimen with Ad5-nCoV and BNT. MethodsProspective observational study included a subgroup analysis of patients who received the Ad5-nCoV immunization during the first trimester of 2021 in a Northern city of Mexico; and agreed to a follow-up for an entire year through SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies measurement samples. During the three months follow-up, some patients self-reported receiving a BNT boost. We report IgG levels from basal, 21-28 days after Ad5-nCoV dose, three months, and an additional 21-28 days after BNT boost. ResultsSeventeen patients 40 (16) years old, 52.9% men, were analyzed. We created four groups: (G1) patients vaccinated with Ad5-nCoV with no history of SARS-COV-2 (n=4), (G2) patients vaccinated with Ad5-nCoV and the first shot of BNT with no history of SARS-COV-2 (n=6), (G3) patients vaccinated with Ad5-nCoV with history of SARS-COV-2 (n=5), and (G4) patients vaccinated with Ad5-nCoV and the first shot of BNT with history of SARS-COV-2 (n=2). The group immunized with a heterologous vaccine scheme reported higher antibodies after 21-28 days of follow-up after BNT boost. Median (IQR): G1 46.7 (-), G2 1077.5 (1901), G3 1158.5 (2673.5), and G4 2090 (-) (p<0.05). Headache was the most frequent adverse reaction when patients received Ad5-nCoV (n = 10, 83%), and pain at the injection site was the most frequent adverse reaction with BNT boost (n = 5, 83.3%).

Thus, it is essential to improve our understanding of COVID-19 transmission, and develop more focused and effective strategies. As human mobility drives transmission, data from cellphone devices can be utilized to achieve these goals. METHODS: We analyzed aggregated and anonymized mobility data from the cell phone devices of> 3 million users between February 1, 2020, to May 16, 2020 - in which several movement restrictions were applied and lifted in Israel. We integrated these mobility patterns into age-, risk- and region-structured transmission model. Calibrated to coronavirus incidence in 250 regions covering Israel, we evaluated the efficacy and effectiveness in decreasing morbidity and mortality of applying localized and temporal lockdowns (stay-at-home order). RESULTS: Poorer regions exhibited lower and slower compliance with the restrictions. Our transmission model further indicated that individuals from impoverished areas were associated with high transmission rates. Considering a horizon of 1-3 years, we found that to reduce COVID-19 mortality, school closure has an adverse effect, while interventions focusing on the elderly are the most efficient. We also found that applying localized and temporal lockdowns during regional outbreaks reduces the overall mortality and morbidity compared to nationwide lockdowns. These trends were consistent across vast ranges of epidemiological parameters, and potential seasonal forcing. CONCLUSIONS: More resources should be devoted to helping impoverished regions. Utilizing cellphone data despite being anonymized and aggregated can help policymakers worldwide identify hotspots and apply designated strategies against future COVID-19 outbreaks.","Yechezkel, Matan; Weiss, Amit; Rejwan, Idan; Shahmoon, Edan; Ben-Gal, Shachaf; Yamin, Dan",BMC Public Health,122,20

Among the extensive and crucial research that has been carried out in the last months, the analysis of the virus-host relationship plays an important role in drug discovery. Virus-host protein-protein interactions are the active agents in virus replication, and the analysis of virus-host protein-protein interaction networks is fundamental to the study of the virus-host relationship. RESULTS: We have adapted and implemented a recent integer linear programming model for protein-protein interaction network alignment to virus-host networks, and obtained a consensus alignment of the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 virus-host protein-protein interaction networks. Despite the lack of shared human proteins in these virus-host networks, and the low number of preserved virus-host interactions, the consensus alignment revealed aligned human proteins that share a function related to viral infection, as well as human proteins of high functional similarity that interact with SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 proteins, whose alignment would preserve these virus-host interactions.","Llabrés, Mercè; Valiente, Gabriel",PLoS One,122,16

Particularly in health and medical research, Google Trends has been increasingly used over the last decade. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the search activity of pain-related parameters on Google Trends from among the most populated regions worldwide over a 3-year period from before the report of the first confirmed COVID-19 cases in these regions (January 2018) until December 2020. METHODS: Search terms from the following regions were used for the analysis: India, China, Europe, the United States, Brazil, Pakistan, and Indonesia. In total, 24 expressions of pain location were assessed. Search terms were extracted using the local language of the respective country. Python scripts were used for data mining. All statistical calculations were performed through exploratory data analysis and nonparametric Mann-Whitney U tests. RESULTS: Although the overall search activity for pain-related terms increased, apart from pain entities such as headache, chest pain, and sore throat, we observed discordant search activity. Among the most populous regions, pain-related search parameters for shoulder, abdominal, and chest pain, headache, and toothache differed significantly before and after the first officially confirmed COVID-19 cases (for all, P<.001). In addition, we observed a heterogenous, marked increase or reduction in pain-related search parameters among the most populated regions. CONCLUSIONS: As internet searches are a surrogate for public interest, we assume that our data are indicative of an increased incidence of pain after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, as these increased incidences vary across geographical and anatomical locations, our findings could potentially facilitate the development of specific strategies to support the most affected groups.","Szilagyi, Istvan-Szilard; Ullrich, Torsten; Lang-Illievich, Kordula; Klivinyi, Christoph; Schittek, Gregor Alexander; Simonis, Holger; Bornemann-Cimenti, Helmar",J Med Internet Res,122,29

A systematic review,14.625191,4.9029474,2020,"CONTEXT: In spring 2020, New York experienced a surge of patients hospitalized with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19) disease, as part of a global pandemic. There are limited data on populations of COVID-19-infected patients seen by palliative care services. OBJECTIVE: To describe a palliative care population at one New York hospital system during the initial pandemic surge. METHODS: This repeated cross-sectional, observational study collected data on palliative care patients in a large health system seen during the COVID-19 outbreak and compared it with pre-COVID data. RESULTS: Palliative service volume surged from 678 (4% of total admissions) before COVID-19 to 1071 (10% of total admissions) during the COVID-19 outbreak. During the outbreak, 695 (64.9%) of the total palliative patients tested positive for the virus. Compared with a preoutbreak group, this COVID-19-positive group had higher rates of male (60.7% vs. 48.6%, P < 0.01) and Latino (21.3% vs. 13.3%; P < 0.01) patients and less white patients (21.3% vs. 13.3%; P < 0.01). Our patients with COVID-19 also had greater prevalence of obesity and diabetes and lower rates of end-stage organ disease and cancers. The COVID-19-positive group had a higher rate of intensive care unit admissions (58.9% vs. 33.9%; P < 0.01) and in-hospital mortality rate (57.4% vs. 13.1%; P < 0.01) than the preoutbreak group. There was increased odds of mortality in palliative care patients who were COVID-19 positive (odds ratio = 3.21; 95% confidence interval = 2.43-4.24) and those admitted to the intensive care unit (odds ratio = 1.45; 95% confidence interval = 1.11-1.9). CONCLUSION: During the initial surge of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York, palliative care services experienced a large surge of patients who tended to be healthier at baseline and more acutely ill at the time of admission than pre-COVID-19 palliative patients.","Moriyama, Derek; Scherer, Jennifer S; Sullivan, Ryan; Lowy, Joseph; Berger, Jeffrey T",J Pain Symptom Manage,122,1

Multiple studies have examined the diagnostic utility and individual laboratory performance of exome testing; however, no previous study has surveyed and compared the data quality from multiple clinical laboratories. METHODS: We examined sequencing data from 36 clinical exome tests from 3 clinical laboratories. Exome data were compared in terms of overall characteristics and coverage of specific genes and nucleotide positions. The sets of genes examined included genes in Consensus Coding Sequence (CCDS) (n = 17723), a subset of genes clinically relevant to epilepsy (n = 108), and genes that are recommended for reporting of secondary findings (n = 57; excludes X-linked genes). RESULTS: The average exome nucleotide coverage (&#8805;20×) of each laboratory varied at 96.49% (CV = 3%), 96.54% (CV = 1%), and 91.68% (CV = 4%), for laboratories A, B, and C, respectively. For CCDS genes, the average number of completely covered genes varied at 12184 (CV = 29%), 11687 (CV = 13%), and 5989 (CV = 37%), for laboratories A, B, and C, respectively. With smaller subsets of genes related to epilepsy and secondary findings, the CV revealed low consistency, with a maximum CV seen in laboratory C for both epilepsy genes (CV = 60%) and secondary findings genes (CV = 71%). CONCLUSIONS: Poor consistency in complete gene coverage was seen in the clinical exome laboratories surveyed. The degree of consistency varied widely between the laboratories.","Gotway, Garrett; Crossley, Eric; Kozlitina, Julia; Xing, Chao; Fan, Judy; Hornbuckle, Callie; Thies, Jenny; Michel, Donnice; Quinn, Christine; Scheuerle, Angela E; Umana, Luis A; Uhles, Crescenda L; Park, Jason Y",Clin Chem,122,26

Patients and Methods: We performed a multicenter retrospective cohort study of hospitalized COVID-19 positive patients. A total of 764 patients admitted to 14 different hospitals within the Cleveland Clinic from 03/09/2020 to 05/20/2020 who had reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction proven coronavirus infection were included. We used LightGBM, a machine learning algorithm, to predict in-hospital mortality at different time points (after 7 days, 14 days, and 30 days of hospitalization) and in-hospital LOS. Results: Among 764 patients, 116 (15%) either died (n = 87) or were transitioned to hospice care (n = 29) during their hospitalization. The median LOS was 5 days (range 1 - 44 days) for patients admitted to the regular nursing floor and 10 days (range 1-38 days) for patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Patients who died during hospitalization were older, initially admitted to the ICU, more likely to be white and to have worse organ dysfunction compared to patients who survived their hospitalization. Using the 10 most important variables only, the final model's area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics curve was 0.86 for 7-day, 0.88 for 14-day, and 0.85 for 30-day mortality in the validation cohort. Conclusions: We developed a decision tool that can provide explainable and patient-specific prediction of in-hospital mortality and LOS for COVID-19 positive patients. The model can aid healthcare systems in bed allocation and distribution of vital resources.","Rozenbaum, Daniel; Shreve, Jacob; Radakovich, Nathan; Douggal, Abhijit; Jehi, Lara; Nazha, Aziz",,122,16

Here, we stratified COVID-19 patients based on their comorbidities to assess their risk of serious adverse outcomes. We collected 856 hospitalized cases diagnosed with COVID-19 from 17 January to 7 February 2020, in Zhejiang Province, and analyzed their comorbidities and composite endpoint (including admission to intensive care unit owing to disease progression, shock, invasive ventilation, and death) to determine the relationship between comorbidities and adverse outcomes. The median age of patients was 46 (36-56) years; 439 (51.3%) were men, 242 (28.3%) had comorbidities, and 152 (17.8%) had two or more comorbidities. The most common comorbidity was hypertension (142 [16.6%]), followed by diabetes (64 [7.5%]). Of the 856 patients, there are 154 (18.0%) severe cases. Thirty-two (3.7%) reached composite endpoints, of which 22 (9.1%) were from the comorbidity group and 10 (1.6%) from the non-comorbidity group (P < .001). After adjusting for age and gender status, the risk of reaching the composite endpoint was higher in the group with comorbidity than in that without comorbidity (hazard ratio [HR] 3.04, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.40-6.60). HR values for patients with one, two, and three or more comorbidities were 1.61 (95% CI: 0.44-5.91), 3.44 (95% CI: 1.31-9.08), and 6.90 (95% CI: 2.69-17.69), respectively.

420497,420497,420497,What Americans Think About Worker Power and Organization: Lessons from a New Survey,14.41423,4.9812937,2020,"Four years ago, I spent close to ten months poring over the Musée Condé's nearly 500 portrait sheets by Louis Carrogis (1717–1806), called Carmontelle, in the service of my doctoral dissertation.1 These portraits have been bound in ten albums since c. 1887, the year in which they were sent to a book binder in Brussels by Henri d'Orléans, Duc d'Aumale (1822–1897), who effectively founded the Musée Condé at the Château de Chantilly and bequeathed to it his robust collection of Carmontelle drawings, the largest group of Carmontelle's portraits in the world, stipulating in his bequest that these drawings could never leave the Musée Condé.2 It is fitting that the institution to which ten red Moroccan leather-bound volumes of Carmontelle's portraits are legally bound should mount an exhibition that largely reflects the Duc d'Aumale's own arrangement of Carmontelle's portraits across the large volumes in which they are normally contained.3 While I was, unfortunately, unable to travel to the Château de Chantilly to see this exhibition, which opened on September 5, 2020 after its originally-planned July 2020 debut was delayed (and closed temporarily from late November through December of 2020) on account of the COVID-19 pandemic, I am fortunate to have a friend in France who generously photographed the entire show in my stead.4 Having become familiar with the galleries in which the Musée Condé's 2020–2021 Carmontelle exhibition was mounted during my nearly year-long 2016–2017 stint in Chantilly, my virtual visit of the exhibition was as close to an in-person saunter as one could hope for from afar. A twenty-two-minute private tour of the exhibition led by its curator, Nicole Garnier-Pelle (and produced by Scribe accroupi) was uploaded to the Domaine de Chantilly's website in December of 2020 in response to the Musée Condé's continued closure, thus enriching my own experience of the exhibition and inviting all interested international (French-speaking) viewers to enjoy a delightful and digestible virtual visit via video. The initial gallery, for instance, was devoted to the Orléans court and was predominantly filled with portraits from Tome I, entitled Princes français, Maison du roi, Princes étrangers, Militaires.5 The second and fifth galleries of the exhibition likewise reflected other tomes' titles, which are also in keeping with the Duc d'Aumale's classification system.6 Nicole Garnier-Pelle, Curator in Charge of the Musée Condé (and creator of this exhibition), must, however, be credited with giving portraits in two tomes that are rather unimaginatively dubbed ""Dames"" their due by way of including them in the third gallery, which celebrated salonnières, and in the fourth gallery, which featured portraits of grandmothers, mothers, and milkmaids, in a nod to Jean-Jacques Rousseau's reforms for children's education and the return to nature that emerged towards the end of the eighteenth century.7 In what read as an act of homage to the collection history of the Musée Condé's impressive Carmontelle holdings, the first gallery actually included Tome I. This album was placed in a vitrine immediately to the left of the gallery's entrance and opened to this volume's second (and still bound) drawing: a portrait of Louis-Philippe, Duc d'Orléans (1725–1785)—Carmontelle's patron from 1759 until the duke's death in 1785 (and the Duc d'Aumale's great-grandfather). An oft-quoted comment by Baron von Grimm (whose portrait by Carmontelle was included in the exhibition's third gallery) suggests that Carmontelle ""created portraits in two hours' time,"" but given the precision with which Carmontelle applied his watercolors and the repetition of the same sitter twice on the same sheet, it seems likely that Carmontelle's process may have been more complicated and perhaps more time-consuming than Grimm would have us believe.11 The presence of a white, wood-paneled door with gilded moldings (aptly echoed by the light grey boiserie in the Musée Condé's recently refurbished Cabinet d'arts graphiques;see Figure 4) in an otherwise outdoor setting (signaled by a portico, a balustrade, and fluted pilasters made of stone) also insinuates the role that Carmontelle's imagination played in the production of his portraits, which are frequently written off as unimaginative because of their expectable, mostly full-length, profile format.","Bernstein, Margot",Eighteenth - Century Studies,122,20

Several reports have provided conflicting recommendations regarding contact lenses (CL) use during COVID-19, causing confusion among CL wearers. The aim of this study is to assess CL wearers' attitudes toward CL wear and care during COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A web-based cross-sectional online survey was used to assess the participants' attitude toward CL wear and care during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey layout was based on Google form® specifically developed for CL wearers. Demographic characteristics and CL history and profile were also collected for each participant. RESULTS: A total of 196 CL wearers completed the online survey with an average age was 26 (± 4.1) and 90.8 % of participants were females. As reported by the participants, social media was the main source of information about COVID-19. 38.8 % of the study population reported stopping CL wear during the pandemic. The main stated reason for lens discontinuation was decreased social activities during the pandemic. 61.2 % of participants continued lens wear, with the majority reported considerable changes in their behaviors toward CL wear and care during the pandemic. This includes reinforced hands cleaning before and after lens wear, disinfecting of CLs and CL case and less frequent CL aftercare visits. CONCLUSION: The majority of the study population have continued CL wear during the pandemic. Contact lens wearers reported profound changes in attitudes toward CL wear including improved care and maintenance.

Although scientific information on COVID-19 is constantly increasing, it mainly focuses on genetic, epidemiological aspects, and public health measures, leaving aside possible effects on mental health. In order to summarize the current evidence, we present a narrative review of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health. So far, the presence of anxiety, depression, and stress has been reported mostly in general population. Nonetheless, mental health issues have also been reported in health care workers, especially among female professionals, nurses, and those who work directly with suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19.

It's little wonder that the plague mask in the collection of the German Museum of the History of Medicine in Ingolstadt (Bavaria) is one of the museum's most popular objects and motifs. This forum paper investigates the figure of the plague doctor on several levels: first, it analyses contemporary textual and image sources in regard to protective clothing used in times of plague and the respective role of the beak-like part of the mask. Then it takes a close look at the Ingolstadt specimen. By examining the mask's materiality and fabrication, questions of its authenticity and practicability are raised. Finally, the Ingolstadt mask is compared with the specimen at the German Historical Museum in Berlin.The conclusion: the beak mask is not mentioned before the mid-seventeenth century, and then only in Italy and Southern France. There is no proof at all of its use during plague outbreaks in Middle Europe. And the specimens in Ingolstadt and Berlin? Both masks present details which suggest that they were not used as protective clothing at all.

Our purpose was to report current and historical representation trends for Black physicians in the US RO workforce. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Public registries were used to assess significant differences in 2016 representation for US vs RO Black academic full-time faculty, residents, and applicants. Historical changes from 1970 to 2016 were reported descriptively. Linear regression was used to assess significant changes for Black residents and faculty from 1995 to 2016. RESULTS: In 2016, Black people represented 3.2% vs 1.5% (P < .001), 5.6% vs 3.2% (P = .005), and 6.5% vs 5.4% (P = .352) of US vs RO faculty, residents, and applicants, respectively. Although RO residents nearly doubled from 374 (1974) to 720 (2016), Black residents peaked at 31 in 1984 (5.9%; 31 of 522) and fell to 23 (3.2%; 23 of 720) in 2016 across 91 accredited programs; Black US graduate medical education trainees nearly doubled over the same period: 3506 (1984) to 6905 (2016). From 1995 to 2016, Black US resident representation significantly increased by 0.03%/y, but decreased significantly in RO by -0.20%/y before 2006 and did not change significantly thereafter. Over the same period, Black US faculty representation significantly increased by 0.02%/y, whereas Black RO faculty significantly increased by 0.07%/y before 2006, then decreased significantly by -0.16%/y thereafter. The number of Black RO faculty peaked at 37 in 2006 (3.1%; 37 of 1203) and was 27 (1.5%; 27 of 1769) in 2016, despite the nearly 1.5-fold increase in the number of both RO faculty and Black US faculty overall (4169 in 2006 and 6047 in 2016) during that period. CONCLUSIONS: Black physicians remain disproportionately underrepresented in RO despite an increasing available pipeline in the US physician workforce. Deliberate efforts to understand barriers to specialty training and inclusion, along with evidence-based targeted interventions to overcome them, are needed to ensure diversification of the RO physician workforce.","Deville, Curtiland; Cruickshank, Ian; Chapman, Christina H; Hwang, Wei-Ting; Wyse, Rhea; Ahmed, Awad A; Winkfield, Karen M; Thomas, Charles R; Gibbs, Iris C",Int. j. radiat. oncol. biol. phys,122,22

OBJECTIVE: To explore the effectiveness and safety of recombinant human interferon alpha (rhIFN-&#945;) nasal drops for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) through administering it to medical staff. METHOD: This was a prospective open-label clinical trial with parallel intervention assignment conducted on 2944 medical staff including both doctors and nurses from Taihe Hospital, Shiyan City, Hubei Province, China from January 21, 2020 to July 30, 2020. The participants were bifurcated into two groups of low risk and high risk groups according to the level of direct exposure to COVID-19 patients. The individuals of the low-risk group received rhIFN-&#945; nasal drops for one month in addition to first level protection, and the high-risk group received a combination of rhIFN-&#945; nasal drops coupled with thymosin-&#945;1 with either second or third-level protection protocol. Moreover, the new-outset of COVID-19 pneumonia diagnosed by chest computed tomography (CT), after thirty days was the primary outcome. The adverse reactions were recorded in all participants. RESULTS: Two thousand and four hundred fifteen of 2944 individuals belonged to the low-risk group, while 529 to the high-risk group. There was no COVID-19 pneumonia in either of the group after thirty days. The pulmonary CT scans were negative for COVID-19 pneumonia in both the groups with no new clinical symptoms. No serious adverse event was observed during the course of the intervention. CONCLUSION: The rhIFN-&#945; nasal drops along with augmented safeguard based on standard physical isolation could effectively protect medical staff against COVID-19 pneumonia.","Meng, Zhongji; Wang, Tongyu; Chen, Li; Chen, Xinhe; Li, Longti; Qin, Xueqin; Li, Hai; Luo, Jie",Curr. top. med. chem,122,16

Particle matter (PM) may be released from packages and transferred to the air during a typical peeling process, but little is known about this package-to-air migration route of particles. Here, we investigated the emission profiles of total and biological particles, and the horizontal and vertical dispersion abilities and community structure of viable microbes released from packaging to the air by peeling. The results revealed that a lot of inhalable particles and viable microbes were released from package to the air in different migration directions, and this migration can be regulated by several factors including package material, effective peeling area, peeling speed and angles, as well as the characteristics of the migrant itself. Dispersal of package-borne viable microbes provides direct evidence that viable microbes, including pathogens, can survive the aerosolization caused by peeling and be transferred to air over different distances while remaining alive. Based on the experimental data and visual proof in movies, we speculate that nonbiological particles are package fibers fractured and released to air by the external peeling force exerted on the package and that microbe dispersal is attributed to surface-borne microbe suspension by vibration caused by the peeling force. This investigation provides new information that aerosolized particles can deliver package-borne substances and viable microbes from packaging to the ambient environment, motivating further studies to characterize the health effects of such aerosolized particles and the geographic migration of microbes via packaging.","Han, Ruining; Yu, Chenglin; Tang, Xuening; Yu, Song; Song, Min; Shen, Fangxia; Fu, Pingqing; Hu, Wei; Du, Lin; Wang, Xinfeng; Herrmann, Hartmut; Wu, Yan",Environ Pollut,122,16

This meta-analysis aimed to assess the pooled incidence of COVID-19 complications and to identify the association between the incidence of complications and age. METHODS: Comprehensive databases, PubMed, Hinari, and Google Scholar, were used to locate potential articles for this review. Data were extracted using Microsoft Excel and imported to the STATA/MP version 16.0 software for analysis. Heterogeneity between studies was assessed using the Cochrane Q test statistics and I2 test, and small study effect was checked using Egger's statistical test at 5% significant level. Sensitivity analysis was checked. A random-effects model was conducted to estimate the pooled incidence of COVID-19 complications. Univariate meta-regression was conducted to identify the association between the mean ages with each complication. RESULTS: From the total of 1237 studies, 12 studies were included with a total of 3064 COVID-19 patients. The most complications were acute respiratory distress syndrome (30.93%, 95%CI 21.3-40.6%) followed by acute liver injury (22.8%, 95%CI 14-31.5%), shock (10.9%, 95%CI 7.4-14.4%), acute kidney injury (7%, 95%CI 3.8-10.4%), and acute cardiac injury (6.4%, 95%CI 2.8-15.6%). Univariate meta-regression revealed that as the mean age increased by 1 year, the incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury, acute cardiac injury, and shock increased by a factor of 2.9 (ß = 2.9, 95%CI 2.4-3.4, adjusted R2 = 88), 0.4 (ß = 0.4, 95%CI 0.04-0.72, adjusted R2 = 54), 1.6 (ß = 1.6, 95%CI 1.1-2.1, adjusted R2 = 85), and 1.1 (ß = 1.1, 95%CI 0.8-1.5, adjusted R2 = 26) times respectively.

Modern off-the-shelf wrist-worn devices, such as the Apple Watch, FitBit, and Samsung Gear, have an onboard sensor called a pulse oximeter. While pulse oximeters are capable of measuring both Sp02 and heart rate, current wrist-worn devices use them only to determine heart rate, as Sp02 measurements collected from the wrist are believed to be inaccurate. Enabling oxygen saturation monitoring on wearable devices would make these devices tremendously more useful for health monitoring and open up new avenues of research. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first study of the reliability of Sp02 sensing from the wrist. Using a custom-built wrist-worn pulse oximeter, we find that existing algorithms designed for fingertip sensing are a poor match for this setting, and can lead to over 90% of readings being inaccurate and unusable. We further show that sensor placement and skin tone have a substantial effect on the measurement error, and must be considered when designing wrist-worn Sp02 sensors and measurement algorithms.

DESIGNThis work is based on data collected by the National Child Mortality Database (NCMD) which collates data on all children who die in England. The number of deaths, and their characteristics, from 1st April 2020 until 31st of March 2021 (2020-21), were compared to those from the same period of 2019-20. Relative risk and excess mortality were derived for deaths in 2020-21 vs 2019-20. SETTINGAll deaths reported to NCMD in England of children under 18 years of age, between April 2019 and March 2021. PARTICIPANTS6490 deaths of children, under the age of 18 years, reported to the NCMD over the study period. RESULTSChildren who died between April 2020 and March 2021 had similar demographics to those who died in 2019-20. Overall, there were 356 (198 to 514) fewer deaths in 2020-21 than in 2019-20 (RR 0.90 (0.85-0.94), p<0.001). Repeating the analysis by category of death, suggested that deaths from infection (RR 0.49 (0.38-0.64)) and from other underlying medical conditions (RR 0.75 (0.68-0.82)) were lower in 2020-21 than 2019-20, and weak evidence (p=0.074) that this was also true of deaths from substance abuse. CONCLUSIONSChildhood mortality in England during the first year of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic was the lowest on record, with over 300 fewer deaths than the preceding 12 months. The greatest reduction was seen in children less than 10 years old. It is important that we learn from this effect, that potentially offers alternative ways to improve the outcome for the most vulnerable children in our society.","Odd, David E; Stoianova, Sylvia; Williams, Tom; Fleming, Peter; Luyt, Karen",,122,1

In this study, we examine changes in physical activity, sleep quality, and psychosocial variables among older people during COVID-19 lockdown. We build on cross-sectional studies on this topic by assessing change longitudinally. We also examined whether participant characteristics including demographic, cognitive, personality, and health variables were related to more positive or negative changes during lockdown. (2) Methods: 137 older participants (mean age 84 years) from the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 study were included in the analysis. They completed the same questionnaires assessing physical activity, sleep quality, mental wellbeing, social support, loneliness, neighbourhood cohesion, and memory problems before (mostly 2 years earlier) and again during national lockdown. (3) Results: On average, levels of physical activity were reduced (those doing minimal physical activity increased from 10% to 19%) and perceived social support increased during lockdown (effect size drm = 0.178). More positive change in the psychosocial and behavioural outcome variables during lockdown was associated with personality traits (greater intellect, emotional stability, and extraversion) and having a higher general cognitive ability. Participants with a history of cardiovascular disease, more symptoms of anxiety, or who lived alone were more likely to experience negative changes in the outcome variables during lockdown. (4) Discussion: These results provide further insight into the experiences of older people during the COVID-19 pandemic and could help to identify those at greatest risk of negative psychosocial or behavioural changes during this time.","Okely, Judith A; Corley, Janie; Welstead, Miles; Taylor, Adele M; Page, Danielle; Skarabela, Barbora; Redmond, Paul; Cox, Simon R; Russ, Tom C",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),122,20

Despite that human-to-human is the recognized main virus transmission way, several authors supposed pollution-to-human mechanisms to justify the appearance of contagious in Italy. However, these works often suffered of a lack of analysis of possible overlapping of different variables, other than only environmental ones. After a decreasing of detected cases in summer, Europe faced with the appearance of a COVID-19 second wave. In this context the Italy situation appeared to be ""strange"". Indeed, compared with the other selected Countries (France, Germany, UK, and Spain), the Italian infection cases resulted to be lower, in the same analysed period. This work is devoted to find a possible justification of the unexpected situation found in Italy. A comparison of the imposed restrictions in the considered Countries allows to highlight that some policies result more effective to limit the virus spread. This clearly shows that the imposed constraints and the people capacities to receipt them are fundamental parameters that must be always accounted in the determination of the virus expansion. The lesson provided by Italy should be achieved by other member states where the COVID-19 sanitary crisis results to be worse. It is evident that the re-opening of ordinary activities involving people interactions, in Autumn, may contribute to promote a larger SARS-CoV-2 diffusion also in Italy. Author strongly highlights that pollution-to-human transmission mechanisms cannot be proposed whiteout considering the complexity of human-to-human interactions, that can be modified by imposed restrictions. It is fundamental to understand that a more precise acknowledge of the variables that should be considered in model predictions, instead of a need of more precise point prediction, will contribute to increase the reliability and the comprehension of the virus diffusion mechanisms, that is fundamental to face this pandemic period.","Bontempi, E",Environ Res,122,1

Though New Zealand has been relatively spared from the pandemic, locally there have been a noticeable spike in the numbers of patients presenting with functional stroke-like symptoms. The diagnosis of FND is challenging;clinical features include a history atypical for organic pathology and physical examination may demonstrate give-way weakness, a Hoover's sign and inconsistent neurological examination findings, particularly when compared with what the patient can perform when distracted. The cause of FND is unknown but may be associated with psychological stresses. Between 1 January to 31 August 2020, there are 24 admissions with stroke-like symptoms in 22 patients who had a final diagnosis of FND. This is in contrast to 5 admissions with FND over the same period in 2019. 9 of the patients admitted with FND acknowledged recent psychological stressors which may have contributed to their symptoms. It was found that an early explanation of the diagnosis, using the term 'functional weakness', demonstrating inconsistencies in examination to reinforce the 'functional' nature of the condition, validating the illness and explaining the overall good prognosis, is well received by patients. In addition to the economic hardship, the COVID-19 pandemic appears to be having an adverse impact on societal health and wellbeing. The volume of patients and healthcare resource implications of FND pose a significant public health issue, and may exacerbate once the full economic impact of COVID-19 is realised. The solution may lie in preventative and remedial action: a focus on societal wellbeing and mental health in the community, educating healthcare professionals on the condition and providing adequate mental health and rehabilitation support in the early recovery period.","Mahawish, K.

Different manufacturers offer reusable community masks in large quantities. The efficacy of these masks, however, is unknown. Method: We tested available community masks of major manufactures and determined the filtration efficacy using radioactive aerosol particles as well as air resistance with a vacuum measurement. Results: Filtration efficacy of the tested reusable community masks ranged from 34.9% ± 1.25% to 88.7% ± 1.18%. Air resistance ranged from 4.3 ± 0.06 to 122.4 ± 0.12 Pa/cm2. There was a good correlation between filtration efficacy and air resistance (Pearson correlation 0.938, p < 0.0001). Conclusions: Filtration efficacy and air resistance differ significantly between the different community masks, but the two measurements correlate well with each other within the entire test series. For optimal protection, one should select a rather airtight mask. When selecting a mask, the highest level of tolerable air resistance can be used as a selection criterion.","Maurer, Lukas; Peris, Davide; Kerl, Jens; Guenther, Frank; Koehler, Dieter; Dellweg, Dominic",J. aerosol med. pulm. drug deliv,122,1

The COVID-19 pandemic, with the consequent lockdown processes, has recently triggered individuals to stockpile foodstuffs. Recent data shows, however, that individuals have not consumed a good proportion of the stockpiled food, resulting in increasing amounts of products ending up wasted. Using a cross-national survey conducted in the United States and India, we investigate how individuals' levels of need for cognitive closure (NFC) relate to food stockpiling and waste during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through a sequential mediation model, we show how individuals high in NFC did not perceive to have enough food at home, ending up buying more food than usual and, eventually, wasting more. Individuals' gender and country of residence moderate such phenomenon, with the effect being more pronounced among Indian (rather than American) women. We discuss how gender roles in different countries can correlate with the stockpiling and food waste processes.

Severe forms of COVID-19 appear to be more frequent in obese patients, but an association with metabolic disorders is not established. Here, we focused on lipoprotein metabolism in patients hospitalized for severe pneumonia, depending on COVID-19 status. Thirty-four non-COVID-19 and 27 COVID-19 patients with severe pneumonia were enrolled. Most of them required intensive care. Plasma lipid levels, lipoprotein metabolism, and clinical and biological (including plasma cytokines) features were assessed. Despite similar initial metabolic comorbidities and respiratory severity, COVID-19 patients displayed a lower acute phase response but higher plasmatic concentrations of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs). NEFA profiling was characterised by higher level of polyunsaturated NEFAs (mainly linoleic and arachidonic acids) in COVID-19 patients. Multivariable analysis showed that among severe pneumonia, COVID-19-associated pneumonia was associated with higher NEFAs, lower apolipoprotein E and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations, independently of body mass index, sequential organ failure (SOFA) score, and C-reactive protein levels. NEFAs and PUFAs concentrations were negatively correlated with the number of ventilator-free days. Among hospitalized patients with severe pneumonia, COVID-19 is independently associated with higher NEFAs (mainly linoleic and arachidonic acids) and lower apolipoprotein E and HDL concentrations. These features might act as mediators in COVID-19 pathogenesis and emerge as new therapeutic targets. Further investigations are required to define the role of NEFAs in the pathogenesis and the dysregulated immune response associated with COVID-19.Trial registration: NCT04435223.","Nguyen, Maxime; Bourredjem, Abderrahmane; Piroth, Lionel; Bouhemad, Bélaïd; Jalil, Antoine; Pallot, Gaetan; Le Guern, Naig; Thomas, Charles; Pilot, Thomas; Bergas, Victoria; Choubley, Hélène; Quenot, Jean-Pierre; Charles, Pierre-Emmanuel; Lagrost, Laurent; Deckert, Valerie; de Barros, Jean-Paul Pais; Guinot, Pierre-Grégoire; Masson, David; Binquet, Christine; Gautier, Thomas; Blot, Mathieu",Sci Rep,122,16

Cutting, edging or grinding ES releases respirable crystalline silica (RCS). Cases of severe and fatal silicosis among ES workers have been described globally. In the United States, more stringent exposure control and medical surveillance regulations were promulgated in 2017 by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. We sought to characterize current silica exposure control and medical surveillance practices among ES employers, with the goal of informing outreach and education on silicosis prevention in these high-risk workplaces. Methods: Utilizing ReferenceUSA data, worksites in Colorado and Ohio with a primary North American Industry Classification System code for cut stone fabrication (327991) or masonry contractors (238140) were identified. We developed a brief anonymous digital survey for ES employers. Questions included number of employees, years in business, products manufactured, exposure monitoring, dust controls, work practices, and employees' use of personal protective equipment, with additional questions on COVID-19 impacts. A knowledgeable ES employer pilot-tested the survey tool. An option to selfidentify was included for employers seeking assistance with regulatory compliance and/or employee training. An invitation to complete the survey was mailed to a preliminary set of Colorado ES businesses. Along with a scannable QR code linked directly to the survey, a brief statement from a respected industry stakeholder that urged ES employers to participate was included. Results: We identified 330 ES businesses in Colorado. 89% employed &lt;10 workers, and &lt; 2% had more than 50 employees. We identified 557 ES businesses in Ohio;86% employed &lt;10 workers. Excluding 25 businesses that lacked address data, we mailed 293 letters to Colorado ES businesses identified through ReferenceUSA. 23% were returned due to incorrect or inactive mailing addresses. Within 6 weeks, only one business had responded to the mailed survey. Discussion: Our study highlights the challenges of surveying employers' approaches to silica exposure control. Despite anonymity, employers may be reluctant to share information that could have perceived regulatory implications. Incorrect addresses from ReferenceUSA and/or currently inactive ES businesses may have contributed to poor response rates, and direct mail appears inadequate for survey purposes. COVID-19 impacts on small employers may also have affected response rates. Future directions include partnering with a national stone fabrication trade association for outreach to ES members via social media and electronic mail.","Macmurdo, M. G.; Zell-Baran, L.; Rose, C.

During the first pandemic wave, administrators and clinicians were obliged to make the difficult decision of whether to suspend or continue a life-saving procedure based on the scarce available evidence regarding the risk of transmission and mortality in immunosuppressed patients. Those centers where the activity continued or was heavily restricted were obliged to screen donors and recipients, design COVID-safe clinical pathways, and promote telehealth to prevent nosocomial transmission. Despite the ever-growing literature on COVID-19, the amount of high-quality literature on LT remains limited. This review will provide an updated view of the impact of the pandemic on LT programs worldwide.

METHODS: Retrospective case series in the University Hospitals Leuven, Belgium of confirmed COVID-19 patients 'after surviving an ICU-stay', 'aged &#8805; 70 years', or 'aged < 70 years with a length of hospitalization > 7 days'. Exclusion criteria were 'unwilling to cooperate', 'medically unstable', or 'palliative care policy'. Following tests were used: 'Five Times Sit To Stand Test', 'hand grip dynamometry', 'Barthel index', 'Swallowing screening', 'Montreal Cognitive Assessment', 'Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale', and 'Nutritional Risk Screening 2002'. RESULTS: One or more tests were obtained in 135/163 patients (83.3%). Physical impairments were present in 43.2-82.8% of the patients. Median BI was 10/20 indicating limited self-dependency. Swallow impairments were present in 3/53 (5.7%) and 24/76 (31.6%) had risk of malnutrition. Impaired memory was seen in 26/43 (60.5%) and 22/47 (46.8%) had elevated anxiety/depression scores. Older adults had more physical, functional, and cognitive impairments. ICU patients had a lower hand grip force. CONCLUSION(S): The high prevalence of physical, cognitive, psychological, and functional impairments in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, both ICU and non-ICU patients, indicates that assessment of impairments is imperative. These results imply that rehabilitation and follow-up is essential for these patients.

The aim was to assess the quality of sleep (QoS) and fatigue in patients with the relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), during the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: The study included 67 patients with RRMS and 85 healthy control subjects. RRMS patients, who were tested in first half of 2019, were retested in April and May 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic. We collected sociodemographic and clinical data, and also used the following questionnaires: Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), and Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 Instrument (MSQOL-54). RESULTS: The FSS score and PSQI global score were significantly higher in patients with RRMS than in the control group (p < 0.01). We noticed a statistically significant difference between the results obtained a year ago and the results during the COVID-19 pandemic in PSQI global score (p < 0.01) and all subscores. Higher disability status was an independent predictor of the worse PSQI scores. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 outbreak worse QoS were noticed in RRMS patients than in healthy individuals. Also, QoS of RRMS patients is more affected during the COVID-19 pandemic than in regular circumstances. High levels of sleep disturbance and fatigue in RRMS patients correlates with worse life quality, female gender, lower educational level and partner status. The results of the present study provide evidence in support of regular screening and monitoring of fatigue and QoS in this patient population, especially during the pandemic states.","Stojanov, Aleksandar; Vojinovic, Slobodan; Stojanov, Jelena; Malobabic, Marina; Stevic, Milos; Milosevic, Vuk; Stanojevic, Goran",Clin Neurol Neurosurg,122,14

In the attempt to control the spread of the disease and the pandemic, numerous COVID-19 vaccines are in development. A review of the evidence on their efficacy and safety are critical. Methods. A search for trials was done using the COVID-19 Living OVerview of Evidence (L·OVE) platform. We also searched for relevant authorization documents and trial reports for COVID-19 vaccines of the US-Food and Drug Authority (US-FDA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the United Kingdom Medicines and Health Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), and the WHO website. We included studies that fulfilled the following inclusion criteria: population – humans;intervention – COVID-19 vaccines;comparison – control or placebo;outcomes – efficacy and adverse events;methods – phase 3 randomized trials. Two reviewers independently screened the reports, assessed the methodological quality, and extracted the data on the trial characteristics and results on vaccine efficacy and safety. The date of last search was March 11, 2021. Results. Interim results of trials investigating five vaccines were identified and included in the review. All five vaccines demonstrated satisfactory vaccine efficacy (VE) against symptomatic COVID-19 infection among adults in the short term with moderate certainty of evidence: BNT162b2, VE 95% (95% CI 90.3, 97.6);mRNA-1273, VE 93.6% (95% CI 88.6, 96.5);ChAdOx1, VE 66.7% (95% CI 57.4, 74.0), Gam-COVID-Vac, VE 91.1% (95% CI 83.6, 95.1);and Ad26.CoV2.S, VE 67.2% (95% CI 59.3, 73.7). Data on the efficacy against severe COVID-19 infection and asymptomatic COVID-19 infection are still inconclusive, except for Ad26.CoV2.S, which demonstrated good efficacy in preventing moderate and/or severe COVID-19 infection and acceptable protection against asymptomatic COVID-19 infection 28 days after vaccination (moderate certainty of evidence). Efficacy data on preventing death from COVID-19 infection are still inconclusive. Very limited phase 3 trial data is available to inform vaccine efficacy against the different variants of SARS-CoV-2. Vaccination with these five vaccines was associated with higher adverse reactions compared to control. These adverse events, due to reactions to the vaccines, were mild to moderate and of short duration. Available evidence on vaccine efficacy and safety is limited, mainly due to the short follow up and the small sample size of specific populations. Conclusion. BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, ChAdOx1, Gam-COVID-Vac and Ad26.CoV.S vaccines demonstrated satisfactory vaccine efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19 infection among adults in the short term with moderate certainty of evidence.

This study aimed to evaluate the waste burden of neurointerventional procedures performed in a radiology department, identify areas for waste reduction, and motivate new greening initiatives. METHODS: We performed a waste audit of 17 neurointerventional procedures at a tertiary-referral center over a 3-month period. Waste was categorized into five streams: general waste, clinical waste, recyclable plastic, recyclable paper, and sharps. Our radiology department started recycling soft plastics from 13 December 2019. Hence, an additional recyclable soft plastic waste stream was added from this time point. The weight of each waste stream was measured using a digital weighing scale. RESULTS: We measured the waste from seven cerebral digital subtraction angiograms (DSA), six mechanical thrombectomies (MT), two aneurysm-coiling procedures, one coiling with tumour embolization, and one dural arteriovenous fistula embolization procedure. In total, the 17 procedures generated 135.3 kg of waste: 85.5 kg (63.2%) clinical waste, 28.0 kg (20.7%) general waste, 14.7 kg (10.9%) recyclable paper, 3.5 kg (2.6%) recyclable plastic, 2.2 kg (1.6%) recyclable soft plastic, and 1.4 kg (1.0%) of sharps. An average of 8 kg of waste was generated per case. Coiling cases produced the greatest waste burden (13.1 kg), followed by embolization (10.3 kg), MT (8.8 kg), and DSA procedures (5.1 kg). CONCLUSION: Neurointerventional procedures generate a substantial amount of waste, an average of 8 kg per case. Targeted initiatives such as engaging with suppliers to revise procedure packs and reduce packaging, digitizing paper instructions, opening devices only when necessary, implementing additional recycling programs, and appropriate waste segregation have the potential to reduce the environmental impact of our specialty.","Shum, Pey Ling; Kok, Hong Kuan; Maingard, Julian; Schembri, Mark; Bañez, Ramon Martin Francisco; Van Damme, Vivienne; Barras, Christen; Slater, Lee-Anne; Chong, Winston; Chandra, Ronil V; Jhamb, Ashu; Brooks, Mark; Asadi, Hamed",J. neurointerv. surg.

Human coronaviruses normally cause no or mild respiratory disease but in the past two decades, potentially fatal coronavirus infections have emerged, causing respiratory tract illnesses such as pneumonia and bronchitis. These include severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), followed by the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and recently the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus outbreak that emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.

To halt the ongoing spread of the pandemic SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and rescue individual patients, established drugs and new therapies are under evaluation. Since it will be some time until a safe and effective vaccine will be available, the immediate priority is to harness innate immunity to accelerate early antiviral immune responses. Second, since excessive inflammation is a major cause of pathology, targeted anti-inflammatory responses are being evaluated to reduce inflammation-induced damage to the respiratory tract and cytokine storms. Here, we highlight prominent immunotherapies at various stages of development that aim for augmented anti-coronavirus immunity and reduction of pathological inflammation.","Schijns, Virgil; Lavelle, Ed C",Eur J Immunol,122,22

We present the first analysis of COVID-19 misinformation networks and determine few of its implications. Firstly, we analyze the spread trends of COVID-19 misinformation and discover that the COVID-19 misinformation statistics are well fitted by a log-normal distribution. Secondly, we form misinformation networks by taking individual misinformation as a node and similarity between misinformation nodes as links, and we decipher the laws of COVID-19 misinformation network evolution: (1) We discover that misinformation evolves to optimize the network information transfer over time with the sacrifice of robustness. (2) We demonstrate the co-existence of fit get richer and rich get richer phenomena in misinformation networks. (3) We show that a misinformation network evolution with node deletion mechanism captures well the public attention shift on social media. Lastly, we present a network science inspired deep learning framework to accurately predict which Twitter posts are likely to become central nodes (i.e., high centrality) in a misinformation network from only one sentence without the need to know the whole network topology. With the network analysis and the central node prediction, we propose that if we correctly suppress certain central nodes in the misinformation network, the information transfer of network would be severely impacted.","Cheng, Mingxi; Yin, Chenzhong; Nazarian, Shahin; Bogdan, Paul",Sci Rep,122,16

Stress-related reactions, if prolonged, may result in mental health problems. We examined the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health in a multinational study and explored the effects of government responses to the outbreak. We sampled 18,171 community adults from 35 countries/societies, stratified by age, gender, and region of residence. Across the 35 societies, 26.6% of participants reported moderate to extremely severe depression symptoms, 28.2% moderate to extremely severe anxiety symptoms, and 18.3% moderate to extremely severe stress symptoms. Coronavirus anxiety comprises two factors, namely Perceived Vulnerability and Threat Response. After controlling for age, gender, and education level, perceived vulnerability predicted higher levels of negative emotional symptoms and psychological distress, whereas threat response predicted higher levels of self-rated health and subjective well-being. People in societies with more stringent control policies had more threat response and reported better subjective health. Coronavirus anxiety exerts detrimental effects on subjective health and well-being, but also has the adaptive function in mobilizing safety behaviors, providing support for an evolutionary perspective on psychological adaptation.","Chen, Sylvia Xiaohua; Ng, Jacky C K; Hui, Bryant P H; Au, Algae K Y; Wu, Wesley C H; Lam, Ben C P; Mak, Winnie W S; Liu, James H",Sci Rep,122,17

METHODS: 98 days of continuous frontotemporal EEG from 11 consecutive patients was evaluated daily by an epileptologist to recommend reduction or maintenance of the sedative level. We evaluated the need to increase sedation in the 6 h following this recommendation. Post-hoc analysis of the quantitative EEG was correlated with the level of sedation using a machine learning algorithm. RESULTS: Eleven patients were studied for a total of ninety-eight sedation days. EEG was consistent with excessive sedation on 57 (58%) and adequate sedation on 41 days (42%). Recommendations were followed by the team on 59% (N = 58; 19 to reduce and 39 to keep the sedation level). In the 6 h following reduction in sedation, increases of sedation were needed in 7 (12%). Automatized classification of EEG sedation levels reached 80% (±17%) accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Visual inspection of a limited EEG helped sedation depth guidance. In a secondary analysis, our data supported that this determination may be automated using quantitative EEG analysis.

The Locus-of-Hope Scale was developed as a cultural adaptation that measures internal and external aspects of agency related to goal-pursuit that are typical in collectivist cultures. The scale has been used to account for variations in well-being-related factors in collectivist societies but still assumes that hope-related thoughts are dispositional. A State Locus-of-Hope Scale was developed to assess hope-related thinking concerning ongoing events and experience during the COVID-19 outbreak in the Philippines in March 2020. The 16-item scale in Filipino was adapted from a short version of Locus-of-Hope Scale. Using data from 3128 respondents, confirmatory factor analysis indicated a good fit between the four-factor model (compared to one-factor and two-factor models), supporting the scale's structural validity. There was also good evidence for the subscales' convergent and discriminant validity. Preliminary evidence for construct criterion validity was demonstrated by examining associations with well-being and anxiety.

METHODS: Data from the Understanding America Study are used to describe group differences in reports of psychological distress and somatic symptoms. Logistic and negative binomial regression models are used to examine whether these differences persist after adjusting for demographic, socioeconomic, and pre-pandemic health conditions. To understand within-group differences in caregiving demands, the intensity of care provided by short-term and long-term caregivers, as well as selected patients' health conditions are summarized. RESULTS: Adults' mental and physical health varied substantially by caregiver status. Caregivers continued to fare worse than non-caregivers in terms of mental health and fatigue, and long-term caregivers were more likely to report headache, body aches, and abdominal discomfort than both short-term caregivers and non-caregivers, net of controls. The nature of caregiving differed between short-term and long-term caregivers, with the latter more likely to provide greater hours of care, and to be looking after patients with permanent medical conditions.

To enhance immunogenicity and mitigate the potential vaccine-induced immunopathology, CpG 1018, a Th1-biasing synthetic toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonist was selected as an adjuvant candidate. S-2P in combination with CpG 1018 and aluminum hydroxide (alum) was found to be the most potent immunogen and induced high titer of neutralizing antibodies in sera of immunized mice against pseudotyped lentivirus reporter or live wild-type SARS-CoV-2. In addition, the antibodies elicited were able to cross-neutralize pseudovirus containing the spike protein of the D614G variant, indicating the potential for broad spectrum protection. A marked Th1 dominant response was noted from cytokines secreted by splenocytes of mice immunized with CpG 1018 and alum. No vaccine-related serious adverse effects were found in the dose-ranging study in rats administered single- or two-dose regimens of S-2P combined with CpG 1018 alone or CpG 1018 with alum. These data support continued development of CHO-derived S-2P formulated with CpG 1018 and alum as a candidate vaccine to prevent COVID-19 disease.","Kuo, Tsun-Yung; Lin, Meei-Yun; Coffman, Robert L; Campbell, John D; Traquina, Paula; Lin, Yi-Jiun; Liu, Luke Tzu-Chi; Cheng, Jinyi; Wu, Yu-Chi; Wu, Chung-Chin; Tang, Wei-Hsuan; Huang, Chung-Guei; Tsao, Kuo-Chien; Chen, Charles",Sci Rep,122,16

METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of data collected from Appalachia Kentucky women (N = 521) ages &#8805;18 enrolled in an intervention. Data included sociodemographics, Beck depression and anxiety inventories, fatalism, and personal control measures. Multiple variable logistic regression was used to investigate the association between demographics and psychological factors. FINDINGS: Participants were predominantly White (96.2%), with mean age 28.93 ± 11.03 years, and the majority (77%) had yearly income below $20,000. Depression was reported by 34.6% (n = 173); 10% (n = 50) experienced moderate or severe anxiety; 20.6% (n = 107) had fatalistic beliefs; and 55.1% (n = 289) believed they lacked personal control over cancer. Women with lower income had higher occurrence of depression (P = .003). Women with moderate to severe anxiety were significantly older than those with low to moderate depression (34.44 vs 28.34, P < .001). Controlling for other variables, as age increased, the odds of fatalistic beliefs increased, OR (95%) = 1.042 (1.022, 1.062). When education level increased, the odds of fatalistic beliefs decreased, OR (95%) = 0.873 (0.800, 0.952). CONCLUSIONS: Given the high occurrence of depression, anxiety, and fatalistic beliefs among this population, health care providers should assess for underlying mental health diagnoses and psychological distress during each patient encounter and provide recommendations to address them.","Adegboyega, Adebola; Dignan, Mark; Sha, Shuying; Nkwonta, Chigozie; Williams, Lovoria B",J. rural health,122,16

BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has infected over a million people, with over 65,000 deaths as of the first quarter of 2020. The current limitation of effective treatment options with no approved vaccine or targeted therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19 has posed serious global health threats. This has necessitated several drug and vaccine development efforts across the globe. To date, the farthest in the drug development pipeline so far is Remdesivir. OBJECTIVES: We perform molecular dynamics simulation, quantify the energy contributions of binding site residues using per-residue energy decomposition calculations, and subsequently generate a pharmacophore model for the identification of potential SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors. METHODS: Integrative molecular dynamics simulations and thermodynamic calculations coupled with advanced postmolecular dynamics analysis techniques were employed. RESULTS: Our analysis showed that the modulatory activity of Remdesivir is characterized by an extensive array of highaffinity and consistent molecular interactions with specific active site residues that anchor Remdemsivir within the binding pocket for efficient binding. These residues are ASP452, THR456, ARG555, THR556, VAL557, ARG624, THR680, SER681, and SER682. Results also showed that Remdesivir binding, induces minimal individual amino acid perturbations, subtly interferes with deviations of C-&#945; atoms and restricts the systematic transition of SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase from the ""buried"" hydrophobic region to the ""surface-exposed"" hydrophilic region. We also mapped a pharmacophore model based on observed high-affinity interactions with SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which showcased the crucial functional moieties of Remdesivir and was subsequently employed for virtual screening. CONCLUSION: The structural insights and the optimized pharmacophoric model provided would augment the design of improved analogs of Remdesivir that could expand treatment options for COVID-19.","Agoni, Clement; Soliman, Mahmoud E S",Curr pharm. biotechnol,122,28

This work presents a processing of TROPOMI NO2 level 2 data into an original time series – the city-scale NO2 plume mass –- that has been designed to quantify the NO2 pollution level over cities This is used to verify the impact of lockdowns on NO2 and to examine how urban NO2 pollution reduction associated with lockdown periods may be quantified, on the basis of yearly variations of the TROPOMI city-scale NO2 plume mass and related uncertainty, exploited over representative periods of time We evaluated this measure and checked the corresponding added value and limitation for quantifying the impact of lockdowns on NO2 variations and separate from other effects, comparing with independent CAMS data and in situ measurements Building on these results, our second objective was to estimate the reduction on the NO2 tropospheric level over four European cities during their respective lockdowns The methodology developed may be applied to any major cities and industrial areas This work should be considered as an initial demonstration for a space-based monitoring system of air quality at the city scale It may also serve as a testbed for assessing national and international regulations to reduce pollutant levels","Prunet, Pascal Lezeaux Olivier Camy-Peyret Claude Thevenon Hervé",City and Environment Interactions,122,26

The development of computer-aided systems based on deep neural networks (DNNs) has been advanced, to rapidly and accurately detect COVID-19 cases, because the need for expert radiologists, who are limited in number, forms a bottleneck for the screening. However, so far, the vulnerability of DNN-based systems has been poorly evaluated, although DNNs are vulnerable to a single perturbation, called universal adversarial perturbation (UAP), which can induce DNN failure in most classification tasks. Thus, we focus on representative DNN models for detecting COVID-19 cases from chest X-ray images and evaluate their vulnerability to UAPs generated using simple iterative algorithms. We consider nontargeted UAPs, which cause a task failure resulting in an input being assigned an incorrect label, and targeted UAPs, which cause the DNN to classify an input into a specific class. The results demonstrate that the models are vulnerable to nontargeted and targeted UAPs, even in case of small UAPs. In particular, 2% norm of the UPAs to the average norm of an image in the image dataset achieves>85% and>90% success rates for the nontargeted and targeted attacks, respectively. Due to the nontargeted UAPs, the DNN models judge most chest X-ray images as COVID-19 cases. The targeted UAPs make the DNN models classify most chest X-ray images into a given target class. The results indicate that careful consideration is required in practical applications of DNNs to COVID-19 diagnosis; in particular, they emphasize the need for strategies to address security concerns. As an example, we show that iterative fine-tuning of the DNN models using UAPs improves the robustness of the DNN models against UAPs.","Hirano, Hokuto; Koga, Kazuki; Takemoto, Kazuhiro",,122,16

However, increased global demand has led to a shortage of commercial SARS-CoV-2 sequencing kits, and not every country has the technological capability or the funds for high-throughput sequencing platforms. Therefore, this study aimed to develop and validate a rapid, cost-efficient genome sequencing protocol that uses supplies, equipment, and methodologic expertise available in standard molecular or diagnostic laboratories to identify circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. MethodsSets of primers flanking the SARS-CoV-2 spike gene were designed using SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences retrieved from the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) Database and synthesized in-house. Primer specificity and final sequences were verified using online prediction analyses with BLAST. The primers were validated using 282 nasopharyngeal samples collected from patients assessed as positive for SARS-CoV-2 at the diagnostic laboratory of the hospital. The patient samples were subjected to RNA extraction followed by cDNA synthesis, conventional polymerase chain reaction, and Sanger sequencing. Protocol specificity was confirmed by comparing these results with SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequencing of the same samples. ResultsSanger sequencing using the newly designed primers and next-generation whole genome sequencing of 282 patient samples indicated identical VOCs results: 123 samples contained the alpha variant (B.1.1.7); 78, beta (B.1.351), 0, gamma (P.1), and 13, delta (B.1.617.2). The remaining samples were not 100% identical to the reference genome; however, 99.97% identity indicated that there was minimal variation as the virus spread throughout the nation. Only four samples had poor sequence quality by Sanger sequencing owing to a low RNA count (Ct value >38). Therefore, mutation calls were >98% accurate. ConclusionsSanger sequencing method using in-house primers is an alternative approach that can be used in facilities with existing equipment to mitigate limitations in high throughput supplies required to identify SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern during the COVID-19 pandemic. This protocol is easily adaptable for detection of emerging variants.","Alhamlan, Fatimah; Bakheet, Dana; Bohol, Marie; Alsanea, Madain; Alahaideb, Basma; Alhadeq, Faten; Alsuwairi, Feda; Al-Abdulkareem, Maha; Asiri, Mohamed; Almaghrabi, Reem; Altamimi, Sarah; Mutabagani, Maysoon; Althawadi, Sahar; Al-Qahtani, Ahmed",,122,24

MicroRNAs (miRNA) play an emerging and important role in the interplay between viruses and host cells. Although the impact of host miRNAs on SARS-CoV-2 infection has been predicted, experimental data are still missing. This study started by a bioinformatics prediction of cellular miRNAs potentially targeting viral RNAs;then, a number of criteria also based on experimental evidence and virus biology were applied, giving rise to eight promising binding miRNAs. Their interaction with viral sequences was experimentally validated by transfecting luciferase-based reporter plasmids carrying viral target sequences or their inverted sequences into the lung A549 cell line. Transfection of the reporter plasmids resulted in a reduction of luciferase activity for five out of the eight potential binding sites, suggesting responsiveness to endogenously expressed miRNAs. Co-transfection of the reporter plasmids along with miRNA mimics led to a further and strong reduction of luciferase activity, validating the interaction between miR-219a-2-3p, miR-30c-5p, miR-378d, miR-29a-3p, miR-15b-5p, and viral sequences. miR-15b was also able to repress plasmid-driven Spike expression. Intriguingly, the viral target sequences are fully conserved in more recent variants such as United Kingdom variant B.1.1.7 and South Africa 501Y.V2. Overall, this study provides a first experimental evidence of the interaction between specific cellular miRNAs and SARS-CoV-2 sequences, thus contributing to understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying virus infection and pathogenesis to envisage innovative therapeutic interventions and diagnostic tools.","Siniscalchi, C.; Di Palo, A.; Russo, A.; Potenza, N.",Frontiers in Genetics,122,10

A serial, weekly, nationally representative, cross-sectional, observational study of randomly selected adults was conducted in Scotland during June and July 2020. If available, validated instruments were used to measure psychological distress, individual demographics, illness beliefs, and the following characteristics: Rurality, area deprivation, access to residential outside space, frequency of visiting, and duration in green space. Simple linear regressions followed by examination of moderation effect were conducted. There were 2969 participants in Study 1, of which 1765 (59.6%) were female, 349 (11.9%) were in the shielding category, and the median age was 54 years. There were 502 participants in Study 2, of which 295 (58.60%) were female, 58 (11.6%) were in shielding category, and the median age was 53 years.

A model of evidence-based public health serves as a structuring framework.The 5 research networks use a variety of access routes for the generation of evidence with regard to the participation of nonacademic, civil society actors and users. There is a wide range of study designs - from randomised controlled trials and systematic reviews to diverse qualitative designs. The use of models and theories supports the evidence base. Beyond evidence generation, all research networks focus on at least exemplary implementation of new evidence.Due to the diversity of methods, a diversified evidence-based approach can be realised, taking into account network-specific aspects. Structural circumstances limit the further systematic strengthening of the evidence base.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients who were referred to our clinic with active CS from 31st March to 15th May 2020 were screened for COVID-19 using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Late-night serum cortisol (64-327 nmol/L), late-night salivary cortisol (LNSC) (0.5-9.4 nmol/L), or 24-h urinary free cortisol (24 hUFC) (100-379 nmol/24 h) were measured by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. RESULTS: Among 22 patients with active CS we found three cases affected by COVID-19. Nonspecific inflammation markers were within the reference range or slightly elevated in these patients. A 71-year-old woman with newly diagnosed CS (late-night serum cortisol >1750 nmol/L, LNSC 908.6 nmol/L) developed dyspnea as an only symptom and died from bilateral polysegmantal hemorrhagic pneumonia 7 days later. A 38-year-old woman with a 5-year medical history of active Cushing's disease (CD) (late-night serum cortisol 581.3 nmol/L, 24 hUFC 959.7 nmol/24-h) suffered from dyspnea, cough, fever (39.3 °C) and chest pain.

The fact that the majority of the problems posed by SARS-CoV-2 infection in pediatric age do not need hospital care and that, therefore, infected children and adolescents can be managed at home highlights the need for a strengthening of territorial pediatric structures. The sharing of hospitalization and therapeutic management criteria for severe cases between professionals is essential to ensure a fair approach based on the best available knowledge. Moreover, the activity of social and health professionals must also include the description, management and limitation of psychophysical-relational damage resulting from the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on the health of children and adolescents, whether or not affected by COVID-19. Due to the characteristics of COVID-19 pathology in pediatric age, the importance of strengthening the network between hospital and territorial pediatrics, school, educational, social and family personnel both for strictly clinical management and for the reduction in discomfort, with priority in children of more frail families, represents a priority.","Esposito, Susanna; Marchetti, Federico; Lanari, Marcello; Caramelli, Fabio; De Fanti, Alessandro; Vergine, Gianluca; Iughetti, Lorenzo; Fornaro, Martina; Suppiej, Agnese; Zona, Stefano; Pession, Andrea; Biasucci, Giacomo",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),122,33

We sought to determine the utility of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) for characterizing lung involvement and, thereby, clinical risk determination in COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: This multicenter, prospective, observational study included patients with COVID-19 who received 12-zone lung ultrasound and chest computed tomography (CT) scanning in the emergency department (ED). We defined lung disease severity using the lung ultrasound score (LUS) and chest CT severity score (CTSS). We assessed the association between the LUS and poor outcome (ICU admission or 30-day all-cause mortality). We also assessed the association between the LUS and hospital length of stay. We examined the ability of the LUS to differentiate between disease severity groups. Lastly, we estimated the correlation between the LUS and CTSS and the interrater agreement for the LUS. We handled missing data by multiple imputation with chained equations and predictive mean matching. Results: We included 114 patients treated between March 19, 2020, and May 4, 2020. An LUS &gt;=12 was associated with a poor outcome within 30 days (hazard ratio [HR], 5.59;95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26-24.80;P = 0.02). Admission duration was shorter in patients with an LUS &lt;12 (adjusted HR, 2.24;95% CI, 1.47-3.40;P &lt; 0.001). Mean LUS differed between disease severity groups: no admission, 6.3 (standard deviation [SD], 4.4);hospital/ward, 13.1 (SD, 6.4);and ICU, 18.0 (SD, 5.0). The LUS was able to discriminate between ED discharge and hospital admission excellently, with an area under the curve of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.75-0.91). Interrater agreement for the LUS was strong: kappa = 0.88 (95% CI, 0.77-0.95). Correlation between the LUS and CTSS was strong: kappa = 0.60 (95% CI, 0.48-0.71). Conclusions: We showed that baseline lung ultrasound - is associated with poor outcomes, admission duration, and disease severity. The LUS also correlates well with CTSS.

Precise estimates of the COVID-19 adverse outcomes on individual patients could have led to better allocation of healthcare resources and more efficient targeted preventive measures. We developed MLHO (pronounced as melo) for predicting patient-level risk of hospitalization, ICU admission, need for mechanical ventilation, and death from patients' past (before COVID-19 infection) medical records. MLHO is an end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline that implements iterative sequential representation mining and feature and model selection to predict health outcomes. MLHO's architecture enables a parallel and outcome-oriented calibration, in which different statistical learning algorithms and vectors of features are simultaneously tested and leveraged to improve prediction of health outcomes. Using clinical data from a large cohort of over 14,000 patients, we modeled the four adverse outcomes utilizing about 600 features representing patients' before-COVID health records. Overall, the best predictions were obtained from extreme and gradient boosting models. The median AUC ROC for mortality prediction was 0.91, while the prediction performance ranged between 0.79 and 0.83 for ICU, hospitalization, and ventilation. We broadly describe the clusters of features that were utilized in modeling and their relative influence on predicting each outcome. As COVID-19 cases are re-surging in the U.S. and around the world, a Machine Learning pipeline like MLHO is crucial to improve our readiness for confronting the potential future waves of COVID-19, as well as other novel infectious diseases that may emerge in the near future.","Estiri, Hossein; Strasser, Zachary H.; Murphy, Shawn N.",,122,15

A third virus, the H5N1, responsible for avian influenza, has caused infection with some clinical similarities to those in COVID-19 infections. Cytokines, small proteins that modulate immune responses, have been directly implicated in some of the severe responses seen in COVID-19 patients, e.g. cytokine storms. Understanding the immune processes related to COVID-19, and other similar infections, could help identify diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets. METHODS: Here we examine data of cytokine, immune cell types, and disease associations captured from biomedical literature associated with COVID-19, Coronavirus in general, SARS, and H5N1 influenza, with the objective of identifying potentially useful relationships and areas for future research. RESULTS: Cytokine and cell-type associations captured from Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms linked to thousands of PubMed records, has identified differing patterns of associations between the four corpuses of publications (COVID-19, Coronavirus, SARS, or H5N1 influenza). Clustering of cytokine-disease co-occurrences in the context of Coronavirus has identified compelling clusters of co-morbidities and symptoms, some of which already known to be linked to COVID-19. Finally, network analysis identified sub-networks of cytokines and immune cell types associated with different manifestations, co-morbidities and symptoms of Coronavirus, SARS, and H5N1. CONCLUSION: Systematic review of research in medicine is essential to facilitate evidence-based choices about health interventions.

Here, we established a screening strategy to identify drugs that reduce ACE2 levels in human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived cardiac cells and lung organoids. Target analysis of hit compounds revealed androgen signaling as a key modulator of ACE2 levels. Treatment with antiandrogenic drugs reduced ACE2 expression and protected hESC-derived lung organoids against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Finally, clinical data on COVID-19 patients demonstrated that prostate diseases, which are linked to elevated androgen, are significant risk factors and that genetic variants that increase androgen levels are associated with higher disease severity.

However, the pathway to diagnosis for suspected coronary heart disease (CHD) symptoms in a rapid access chest pain clinic (RACPC) context is underexplored. The objective of this study was to examine patients' help-seeking experiences of accessing RACPC services, from the point at which they notice and interpret symptoms, to their decision to seek help from their general practitioner. DESIGN: Qualitative study. SETTING: Interviews were conducted in the RACPC at Queen Mary's Roehampton Hospital, London, UK. PARTICIPANTS: Maximum variation sampling was used to recruit 30 participants (15 men and 15 women) referred to a RACPC, using sampling dimensions of age, ethnicity and occupation. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews focussed on the patient experience of their pathway to the RACPC. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the interview data. RESULTS: Participant interpretation of symptoms was shaped by multiple influences; reluctance to seek help contributed to delay; various factors acted as drivers as well as barriers to help-seeking; and GP referrals to RACPC were based on symptoms as well as patients' need for reassurance.

AIM: To evaluate the knowledge Latin American gastroenterologists and endoscopists (staff physicians and residents) have about the characteristics of COVID-19, as well as the prevention measures to be taken during endoscopic procedures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study that included gastroenterologists and endoscopists from 9 Latin American countries. An electronic questionnaire was applied that was designed to evaluate the knowledge of symptoms, risk groups for severe disease, prevention measures, and the reprocessing of endoscopes utilized in patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: Information was obtained from 133 physicians. Ninety-five percent of them correctly identified the most frequent symptoms of the virus, and 60% identified the 3 risk groups for severe disease. Sixty-six percent of those surveyed did not consider it necessary to use standard precautions during endoscopic procedures, and 30% did not consider contact precautions necessary. Forty-eight percent of the participants surveyed were not familiar with the protocol for reprocessing the endoscopes utilized in patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The majority of the gastroenterologists and endoscopists surveyed were familiar with the signs and symptoms of COVID-19 and the populations at risk for complications. There was a lack of knowledge about prevention measures (during clinical care and endoscopic procedures) and the reprocessing of endoscopic equipment by 70% and 48%, respectively, of those surveyed.

However, recent mineralogical discoveries of POMs in mineral structures demonstrate their importance in geochemical systems. In total, 15 different types of POM nanoscale-size clusters in minerals are described herein, which occur in 42 different mineral species. The topological diversity of POM clusters in minerals is rather restricted compared to the multitude of moieties reported for synthetic compounds, but the lists of synthetic and natural POMs do not overlap completely. The metal-oxo clusters in the crystal structures of the vanarsite-group minerals ([As3+V4+2V5+10As5+6O51]7-), bouazzerite and whitecapsite ([M3+3Fe7(AsO4)9O8-;n(OH)n]), putnisite ([Cr3+8(OH)16(CO3)8]8-), and ewingite ([(UO2)24(CO3)30O4(OH)12(H2O)8]32-) contain metal-oxo clusters that have no close chemical or topological analogues in synthetic chemistry. The interesting feature of the POM cluster topologies in minerals is the presence of unusual coordination of metal atoms enforced by the topological restraints imposed upon the cluster geometry (the cubic coordination of Fe3+ and Ti4+ ions in arsmirandite and lehmannite, respectively, and the trigonal prismatic coordination of Fe3+ in bouazzerite and whitecapsite). Complexity analysis indicates that ewingite and morrisonite are the first and the second most structurally complex minerals known so far. The formation of nanoscale clusters can be viewed as one of the leading mechanisms of generating structural complexity in both minerals and synthetic inorganic crystalline compounds. The discovery of POM minerals is one of the specific landmarks of descriptive mineralogy and mineralogical crystallography of our time.","Krivovichev, Sergey V",Acta Crystallogr B Struct Sci Cryst Eng Mater,122,26

Given the variability in viral load across and within patients, absolute viral load quantification directly from crude lysate is important for diagnosis and surveillance. Here, we investigate the use of digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) for SARS-CoV-2 viral load measurement directly from crude lysate without nucleic acid purification. We demonstrate ddPCR accurately quantifies SARS-CoV-2 standards from purified RNA and multiple sample matrices, including commonly utilized universal transport medium (UTM). In addition, we find ddPCR functions robustly at low input viral copy numbers on nasopharyngeal swab specimens stored in UTM without upfront RNA extraction. We also show ddPCR, but not qPCR, from crude lysate shows high concordance with viral load measurements from purified RNA. Our data suggest ddPCR offers advantages to qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 detection with higher sensitivity and robustness when using crude lysate rather than purified RNA as input. More broadly, digital droplet assays provide a potential method for nucleic acid measurement and infectious disease diagnosis with limited sample processing, underscoring the utility of such techniques in laboratory medicine.","Vasudevan, Harish N; Xu, Peng; Servellita, Venice; Miller, Steve; Liu, Leqian; Gopez, Allan; Chiu, Charles Y; Abate, Adam R",Sci Rep,122,16

METHODS: In this prospective single-center study, we determined the serum levels of ACE-2, angiotensin II and aldosterone in patients with COVID-19 compared to control patients presenting with similar symptoms in the emergency unit. RESULTS: We analyzed serum samples from 24 SARS-CoV-2 positive and 61 SARS-CoV-2 negative patients. SARS-CoV-2 positive and control patients did not differ in baseline patients characteristics, symptoms and clinical presentation. Mean serum concentrations of ACE2, angiotensin II, and aldosterone did not differ between the SARS-CoV-2 positive and the control group. In line with this, serum potassium as surrogate parameter for RAAS activity and blood pressure were similar in both groups.

Since December 2019, when the virus was identified in humans, the literature on COVID-19 has grown exponentially and extrarespiratory symptoms including neurologic symptoms are increasingly highlighted. METHODS: Given the high and increasing number of publications reporting neurologic involvements of SARS-Cov-2, we thought that providing an update for neurologic complications of COVID-19 would be useful for physicians and especially young trainees in neurology and neurosurgery. Indeed, in this review we discuss several neurologic aspects reported in the literature to date including the evidence and pathways of neuroinvasion in COVID-19 and the main neurologic disorders reported in the literature to date, as well as future perspectives and the potential long-term consequence of current neuroinfection in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Currently, there is convincing evidence that SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent of COVID-19, can affect the nervous system, with damage and neurologic alterations. These neurologic disorders are grouped into several categories, ranging from nonspecific and moderate symptoms such as headache, myalgia, and hyposmia to severe symptoms including cerebrovascular disease and intracranial infections. Severe neurologic symptoms such as acute cerebrovascular disease occur only in a minority of patients with usual risk factors and are associated with poor outcome. However, most COVID-19 patients exhibit only minor or mild neurologic symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Management of COVID-19 patients should include early clinical, radiologic, and laboratory neurologic assessment, with a close follow-up, especially in severe forms. Future studies should assess late and long-term consequences of current COVID-19 patients with neurologic involvement.","Abboud, Hilal; Abboud, Fatima Zahra; Kharbouch, Hanane; Arkha, Yasser; El Abbadi, Najia; El Ouahabi, Abdessamad",World Neurosurg,122,4

PATIENT CONCERNS: A 24 year-old male was referred originally by his optician at the Emergency Eye Department of the Leicester Royal Infirmary in October 2018 with visual field changes affecting the nasal field of vision in both eyes on routine eye examination. The patient reported ongoing headaches over the last 6 weeks to 8 weeks associated with simultaneous peripheral visual field changes. He also reported rapid loss of weight over the same period of time. DIAGNOSIS: Binasal congruous hemianopia secondary to FVL. INTERVENTIONS: Full past medical and ocular history was obtained. The patient underwent full ophthalmic examination including dilated fundoscopy. Visual acuity was recorded with Snellen Chart. Color vision was assessed with Ishihara plates. Peripheral vision was assessed with both Humphrey visual fields and Goldmann visual fields. Optical coherence tomography of the macula and discs was also performed. Neuroimaging investigations included Computerized Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the Brain. Electrophysiology investigations included Electroretinogram and visual evoked potentials. Patient was also tested for syphilis. OUTCOMES: Humphrey visual fields and Goldmann visual fields confirmed the presence of complete binasal field defects. Optical coherence tomography, electroretinogram, visual evoked potentials, CT, MRI were all unremarkable. Ocular examination was normal. Finally, syphilis serology was negative. After 1 year of follow-up, the visual field changes have remained the same. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the fourth case described in the literature with complete congruous binasal hemianopia due to FVL. We advocate thorough investigations with multimodal imaging of the fundus, neuroimaging and syphilis serology to exclude serious organic causes for binasal field defects prior to labeling such a field defect functional.

METHODS: A two months cohort of retrospective data and consecutively collected specimens from COVID-19 patients or patients under investigation were used to understand the correlation between prolonged viral RNA positive test results, cycle threshold (Ct) values and growth of SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture. Whole genome sequencing was used to confirm virus genotype in patients with prolonged viral RNA detection. Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) was used to assess the rate of false negative COVID-19 diagnostic tests. RESULTS: In two months, 29,686 specimens were tested and 2,194 patients received repeated testing. Virus recovery in cell culture was noted in specimens with SARS-CoV-2 target genes' Ct value average of 18.8 ± 3.4.

Specific subsets of the population are more vulnerable, namely those with chronic diseases. We aimed to estimate the share of the Portuguese population at the highest risk for complications following COVID-19 infection due to both old age and specific comorbidities. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Our sample included all people aged 65 years and above (2215 men and 3486 women) who participated in the fifth Portuguese National Health Interview Survey, conducted in 2014. In order to project the potential population at highest risk for COVID-19, we used the latest available official demographic estimates from the National Institute of Statistics - INE 2018. We used a more restrictive definition of risk combining old age criteria and the following chronic conditions as potential risk factors for COVID-19 according to the available literature: hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardio- and cerebrovascular disease. RESULTS: We estimated that 15.5% (n = 1 560 667) of the Portuguese population might be at increased risk for complications from COVID-19 because of old age and existing chronic conditions. Such estimates vary across the country (from 1.7% in Azores to 33.7% in Northern Portugal). Northern Portugal not only has the highest prevalence of selected morbidity (72.8%) within mainland Portugal, but also has the largest population at risk for COVID-19 (n = 526 607). This was followed by the Lisbon and Tagus Valley region (n = 408 564) and Central Portugal (n = 388 867). DISCUSSION: Our results should encourage authorities to continue protecting those more vulnerable to the pandemic threat, particularly on those areas of the country which are more likely to be further affected. CONCLUSION: We projected a considerable number of Portuguese people at the highest risk for severe COVID-19 disease due to both old age and pre-existing chronic conditions. Such estimates vary across the country.","Laires, Pedro A; Nunes, Carla",Acta Med Port,122,24

These skills are used to determine digital readiness of pre-service teachers. The paper reports on validation of an adjusted set of 54 performance statements which were categorized into seven digital learning domains. The seven digital learning domains were validated based on structural equation modelling which was then confirmed by factor analysis using AMOS software. The results of the analysis indicate the existence of a multi-layered model where all digital learning domains are positively connected to each other. Our findings therefore suggest a strong statistical validity of the performance statement inventory. The findings also point to the fact that pre-service teachers are in a transit phase from digital immigrants to digital natives. That, in the context of COVID-19 pandemic, implies the need to invest in appropriate preparation and training of pre-service teachers to teach in an online environment. The inventory for measuring digital literacy can be used to assess teachers' digital readiness on a regular basis, thereby enabling them to adjust the teaching materials and pedagogy to achieve the required level of digital readiness, as defined by the school.

To date, the effects of any pandemic on telestroke service lines have not been described. The purpose of this cross-sectional analysis of telestroke activations in the 30 days before and after the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic is to describe the difference in case volumes of telestroke activations, the characteristics of patients, and treatment recommendations between the 2 time frames. We found a 50.0% reduction in total telestroke activations between the predeclaration group (142 patients) and the postdeclaration group (71 patients). There were no statistically significant differences in age (P=.95), sex (P=.10), diagnosis (P=.26), or regional variations (P=.08) in activation volumes. The percentage of patients for whom we recommended urgent stroke treatment with intravenous alteplase, mechanical thrombectomy, or both decreased from 44.4% (28 of 63) to 33.3% (11 of 33). The reasons for the sunstantial decrease in telestroke activations and urgent stroke treatment recommendations are likely multifactorial but nevertheless underscore the importance of continued public health measures to encourage patients and families to seek emergency medical care at the time of symptom onset.","Huang, Josephine F; Greenway, Melanie R F; Nasr, Deena M; Chukwudelunzu, Felix E; Demaerschalk, Bart M; O039,; Carroll, Cumara B; Nord, Charisse A; Pahl, Emily A; Barrett, Kevin M; Williams, Lindsy N",Mayo Clin Proc,122,2

A exiguidade dos recursos naturais e econômicos da região do Sudoeste angolano fez com que, desde pelo menos a metade do século XIX, o gado das populações nativas fosse motivo de interesse crescente por parte da sociedade colonial portuguesa. Após os prejuízos causados àquelas populações por guerras movidas pelas autoridades portuguesas entre 1890 e 1926, bem como em decorrência da crise econômica vivida por Portugal em finais da década de 1920, acentua-se a demanda de mão-de-obra africana barata para empreendimentos públicos e privados. Por outro lado, as manadas e a pastorícia nativas passam a ser alvo de uma política de racionalização por parte de técnicos e funcionários administrativos.

We characterized the association between pre-operative SARS-CoV-2 infection and post-operative respiratory failure (PORF). DESIGN AND SETTING: This was a single center retrospective cohort study in New York City between March 14-June 14, 2020. PATIENTS: Exclusion criteria were age < 18-years, obstetric procedures, absence of SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing, and pre-operative respiratory failure. A total of 778 patients met criteria, of which 87 had SARS-CoV-2. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome, PORF, included inability to extubate for &#8805;24 h or unplanned re-intubation within 5 days. Multiple exposures were measured including SARS-CoV-2 infection 4 weeks before or 5 days after surgery. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to adjust for pre-operative hypoxemia, oxygen use, and pneumonia as well as tachycardia, gender, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), Surgical Mortality Probability Model (S-MPM) index, and peri-operative blood transfusion. MAIN RESULTS: SARS-CoV patients had higher CCI (P = 0.007) and S-MPM scores (P = 0.02). The incidence of PORF was 16% versus 7% in uninfected comparators (P = 0.001). Amongst infected individuals, 39% exhibited symptoms of COVID-19 and PORF was more common in these patients compared to asymptomatic individuals (26% vs. 9%, P = 0.04). Adjusted analysis revealed increased odds of PORF with infection (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.2-6.2). This persisted even when adjusting for probable mediators such as pre-operative hypoxemia. Infected patients also demonstrated increased adjusted odds of 30-day mortality (OR 3.5, 95% CI 1.4-9.1). CONCLUSIONS: Detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection within 4 weeks before or 5 days after surgery is associated with increased odds of 5-day PORF and 30-day mortality. This supports delaying elective surgery, but questions remain regarding the applicability of this recommendation for asymptomatic patients needing urgent or semi-urgent procedures such as oncologic surgery.","Kiyatkin, Michael E; Levine, Samantha P; Kimura, Atsumi; Linzer, Ryan W; Labins, Jacqueline R; Kim, Joseph I; Gurvich, Aryeh; Gong, Michelle N",J Clin Anesth,122,2

BaP induces an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-dependent upregulation of the ubiquitin E3 ligase Skp2 for ACE2 ubiquitination. ACE2 in lung tissues of non-smokers is higher than in smokers, consistent with the findings that tobacco carcinogens downregulate ACE2 in mice. Tobacco carcinogens inhibit SARS-CoV-2 spike protein pseudovirions infection of the cells. Given that tobacco smoke accounts for 8 million deaths including 2.1 million cancer deaths annually and Skp2 is an oncoprotein, tobacco use should not be recommended and cessation plan should be prepared for smokers in COVID-19 pandemic.","Wang, Guizhen; Zhao, Qun; Zhang, Hui; Liang, Fan; Zhang, Chen; Wang, Jun; Chen, Zhenyin; Wu, Ran; Yu, Hong; Sun, Beibei; Guo, Hua; Feng, Ruie; Xu, Kaifeng; Zhou, Guangbiao",Front.

We report on a set of pragmatic recommendations for hospital-based IPC practices in resource-constrained settings of LMICs. For cases of confirmed or suspected COVID-19, we suggest that patients be placed in a single isolation room, whenever possible. When single isolation rooms are unavailable or limited, we recommend cohorting patients with COVID-19 on dedicated wards or in dedicated hospitals. We also recommend that cases of suspected COVID-19 be cohorted separately from those with confirmed disease, whenever possible, to minimize the risk of patient-to-patient transmission in settings where confirmatory testing may be limited. We suggest that healthcare workers be designated to care exclusively for patients with COVID-19, whenever possible, as another approach to minimize nosocomial spread. This approach may also be beneficial in conserving limited supplies of reusable personal protective equipment (PPE). We recommend that visitors be restricted for patients with COVID-19. In settings where family members or visitors are necessary for caregiving, we recommend that the appropriate PPE be used by visitors. We also recommend that education regarding hand hygiene and donning/doffing procedures for PPE be provided.

The cardiovascular risk factors for dementia trigger widespread inflammation -- which lead to neurodegeneration, gradual cognitive/memory decline, and eventually (late-onset) dementia. Accordingly, one useful strategy to delay dementia could be based upon nanotargeting drug(s), using lipid nanocarriers, toward a major receptor class responsible for inflammation-associated (cytokine-mediated) cell signaling events. At the same time, the immune response and excessive inflammation, commonly observed in the very recent human coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, may accelerate the progression of brain inflammatory neurodegeneration-which increases the probability of post-infection memory impairment and accelerating progression of Alzheimer's disease. Hence, the proposed multitasking combination therapeutic, using a (biobased) lipid nanocarrier, may also display greater effectiveness at different stages of dementia.","D039,; Arrigo, Joseph S",Am J Alzheimers Dis Other Demen,122,16

Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a key player in the development of cytokine storms. Shedding of interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R&#945;) results in the accumulation of soluble interleukin-6 receptors (sIL-6R). Only relatively few cells express membrane-bound IL-6R&#945;. However, sIL-6R can act on potentially all cells and organs through the ubiquitously expressed gp130, the coreceptor of IL-6R&#945;. Through this, so-called trans-signaling, IL-6-sIL-6R is a powerful factor in the development of cytokine storms and multiorgan involvement. Some bacteria (e.g., Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Listeria monocytogenes), commonly considered to cause co-infections during viral pneumonia, can directly induce the shedding of membrane receptors, including IL-6R&#945;, or enhance endogenous shedding mechanisms causing the increase of sIL-6R level. Here we hypothesise that bacteria promoting shedding and increase the sIL-6R level can be an important contributing factor for the development of cytokine storms. Therefore, inhibition of IL-6R&#945; shedding by drastically reducing the number of relevant bacteria may be a critical element in reducing the chance of a cytokine storm. Validation of this hypothesis can support the consideration of the prophylactic use of antibiotics more widely and at an earlier stage of infection to decrease the mortality rate of COVID-19.

The total amount of PPCPs (ranging from 2.61 to 1122 ng/L in water and 0.11 to 164 ng/g dry weight in sediments) were comparable to historical reports in Yangtze River basin, whereas the detection frequency and concentrations of ribavirin and azithromycin were higher than those of historical studies. The distribution of concerned drugs varied with space, season, media and water types: sampling sites located at WWTPs-river-estuary system around two hospitals (Regions L and J) usually had relatively high waterborne contamination levels, most of which declined in autumn; lakes had relatively low waterborne contamination levels in summer but increased in autumn. The potential risks of detected PPCPs were further evaluated using the multiple-level ecological risk assessment (MLERA): sulfamethoxazole and azithromycin were found to pose potential risks to aquatic organisms according to a semi-probabilistic approach and classified as priority pollutants based on an optimized risk assessment. In general, the COVID-19 pandemic did not cause serious pollution in lakes and WWTPs-river-estuary system in Wuhan City.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this observational longitudinal study was to identify nonoverlapping severity subgroups (ie, clusters) among patients with COVID-19, based exclusively on clinical data and standard laboratory tests obtained during patient assessment in the emergency department. METHODS: We applied unsupervised machine learning to a data set of 853 patients with COVID-19 from the HM group of hospitals (HM Hospitales) in Madrid, Spain. Age and sex were not considered while building the clusters, as these variables could introduce biases in machine learning algorithms and raise ethical implications or enable discrimination in triage protocols. RESULTS: From 850 clinical and laboratory variables, four tests-the serum levels of aspartate transaminase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), and the number of neutrophils-were enough to segregate the entire patient pool into three separate clusters. Further, the percentage of monocytes and lymphocytes and the levels of alanine transaminase (ALT) distinguished cluster 3 patients from the other two clusters. The highest proportion of deceased patients; the highest levels of AST, ALT, LDH, and CRP; the highest number of neutrophils; and the lowest percentages of monocytes and lymphocytes characterized cluster 1. Cluster 2 included a lower proportion of deceased patients and intermediate levels of the previous laboratory tests. The lowest proportion of deceased patients; the lowest levels of AST, ALT, LDH, and CRP; the lowest number of neutrophils; and the highest percentages of monocytes and lymphocytes characterized cluster 3.

On 25 March 2020, Intercollegiate guidelines were published in the UK to promote safe surgical provision during the COVID-19 outbreak advocating non-operative management or avoidance of laparoscopy when surgery is essential. The effects of this on the investigation and management of appendicitis remain unknown. METHODS: We performed a multicentre, prospective, observational study from the start of the new guidelines to the 6th of May 2020. We included all patients referred to surgical teams with suspected appendicitis. A recent historical cohort was identified for comparison. The primary outcome was the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the use of non-operative management in appendicitis. Secondary outcomes included imaging, negative appendicectomy rate (NAR), length of stay (LOS) and 30-day complications. RESULTS: A total of 63/164 (38%) patients compared to 79/191 (41%) were diagnosed with appendicitis before and after the guidelines were introduced (p = 0.589). CT scanning increased (71/164 vs 105/191; p = 0.033) while ultrasound scanning decreased (71/164 vs 62/191; p = 0.037). Appendicitis was more likely to be managed non-operatively (11/63 vs 51/79; p < 0.001) and, of those managed surgically, with an open approach (3/52 vs 26/28 p < 0.001). The NAR also reduced (5/52 vs 0/28; p = 0.157). LOS was shorter in non-operatively managed patients (1 day vs 3 days; p < 0.001) without a difference in complications (10/51 vs 4/28; p = 0.760). CONCLUSION: Introduction of the guidelines was associated with changes in practice. Despite these changes, short-term complications did not increase and LOS decreased. Questions remain on the longer-term complication rates in non-operatively managed patients.","English, W; Habib Bedwani, N; Smith, C; Doganay, E; Marsden, M; Muse, S; Mak, W K; Chana, M; Eves, J; Shatkar, V",Langenbeck&#039;s arch. surg,122,13

A significant proportion of participants self-reported increased negative emotional levels of anxiety (49.2%), worry (72.4%), depression (23.1%), panic (22.6%), and nervousness (38.2%) and decreased positive emotional levels of happiness (44.8%), joy (47.3%), and feelings of excitement (45.1%). Self-reported sleep disorders were not as common (less than 15% for any of the four items), while arguing with others was at 26.7%. Significant differences by gender and academic year were detected. Almost half of participants reported using social media as a main source of COVID-19 information 'most/all-the-times' with a significant effect of such on reducing emotional distress. Conclusion: The results suggest a potential effect of COVID-19 on the emotional distress of medical students. Addressing and mitigating such effects is crucial. The buffering effect of social media should be further investigated. © 2021 Kheirallah K et al.","Kheirallah, K.; Saleh, T.; Bloukh, S.; Khasawneh, W.; Alsulaiman, J.; Khassawneh, A.; Al-Mistarehi, A.

We compared the diagnostic performance of three specimen types for characterizing SARS-CoV-2 in infected nursing home residents. METHODS: A convenience sample of 17 residents were enrolled within 15 days of first positive SARS-CoV-2 result by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and prospectively followed for 42 days. Anterior nasal swabs (AN), oropharyngeal swabs (OP), and saliva specimens (SA) were collected on the day of enrollment, every 3 days for the first 21 days, then weekly for 21 days. Specimens were tested for presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using RT-PCR and replication-competent virus by viral culture. RESULTS: Comparing the three specimen types collected from each participant at each time point, the concordance of paired RT-PCR results ranged from 80–88%. After the first positive result, SA and OP were RT-PCR–positive for ≤48 days; AN were RT-PCR–positive for ≤33 days. AN had the highest percentage of RT-PCR–positive results (81%; 21/26) when collected ≤10 days of participants’ first positive result. Eleven specimens were positive by viral culture: nine AN collected ≤19 days following first positive result and two OP collected ≤5 days following first positive result. CONCLUSIONS: AN, OP, and SA were effective methods for repeated testing in this population. More AN than OP were positive by viral culture. SA and OP remained RT-PCR–positive longer than AN, which could lead to unnecessary interventions if RT-PCR detection occurred after viral shedding has likely ceased.","Gable, Paige; Huang, Jennifer Y; Gilbert, Sarah E; Bollinger, Susan; Lyons, Amanda K; Sabour, Sarah; Surie, Diya; Biedron, Caitlin; Haney, Tafarra; Beshearse, Elizabeth; Gregory, Christopher J; Seely, Kathryn A; Clemmons, Nakia S; Patil, Naveen; Kothari, Atul; Gulley, Trent; Garner, Kelley; Anderson, Karen; Thornburg, Natalie J; Halpin, Alison L; McDonald, L Clifford; Kutty, Preeta K; Brown, Allison C",Clin Infect Dis,122,8

A clear impact of the major intervention measures on the reproduction number (Rt) has been found in all studied countries and territories, as already suggested by the drop in the number of deaths over time. Interestingly, the impact of such major intervention measures seems to be the same in most of these countries. The model has also provided realistic estimates of the total number of infections, active cases and future outcome. While the predictive capabilities of the model are much more uncertain before the peak of the outbreak, we could still reliably predict the evolution of the disease after a major intervention by assuming the afterwards reproduction number from current study.

METHODS: A qualitative Reflexive Thematic Analysis was applied to 10 Photo Elicitation Interviews using images provided by five autistic adults. Interviews were conducted at two time points, before the pandemic and during the first lockdown. FINDINGS: Three themes before the pandemic were identified: (1) everyday interactions, (2) finding sense of belonging, and (3) fractured wellbeing, which revealed the participants’ eagerness to fit in socially whilst experiencing rejection, weakening their mental health. During the first Covid-19 lockdown, two master themes were identified: (1) daily, positive experiences, and (2) surfacing failures, which emphasised an increased lived stigma as well as an ineffective autism support network, contributing to a heightened anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: The current study provides further support to the recent findings highlighting lack of appropriate mental health support for the autistic communities during the pandemic, across the world.

AIMS/OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to assess the eventual changes of the nasal respiratory condition during continuous SM wearing. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fourteen healthcare professionals filled a visual analogue scale (VAS) questionnaire for the detection of eventual nasal breathing impairment or symptoms. Nasal resistance and flow values were obtained via the active anterior rhinomanometry (AAR) that was performed under the basal condition, as well as immediately after wearing the surgical mask (SM) and 3 h after its continuous use. RESULTS: The increase of inspiratory resistance was significantly correlated to the reduction of the maximum flux, when comparing SM parameters to the basal ones (r = -0.70, p < .05). At VAS evaluation, SM wearing showed to induce itching in 70% of the subjects, nasal dryness in 55%, nasal blockage in 50%, headache in 39%, watery nasal discharge in 20% and sneezing in 18%. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: The SMs do not induce evident physiological variations of the nasal function due to a compensatory respiratory mechanism that, despite a progressive increase of nasal resistances, is not inducing significant changes of the nasal fluxes.","Monini, Simonetta; Meliante, Piero Giuseppe; Salerno, Gerardo; Filippi, Chiara; Margani, Valerio; Covelli, Edoardo; Barbara, Maurizio",Acta Otolaryngol,122,1

Background: The COVID-19 pandemic led to systemic change within healthcare settings and demands placed on frontline nurses has been overwhelming. Lessons learned from previous pandemics indicate that clear communication and strong visible leadership can mitigate the impact stressful events may have on nurses. Conversely, a lack of clear leadership and regulatory protocols in times of crisis can lead to an increase in psychological distress for nurses. Design: Secondary analysis of semi-structured interview transcripts. Methods: Secondary data analysis was conducted on data collected during a hospital-wide evaluation of barriers and facilitators to changes implemented to support the surge of COVID-19 related admissions in wave one of the pandemic. Participants represented three-levels of leadership: whole trust (n=17), division (n=7), ward/department-level (n=8), and individual nurses (n=16). Data were collected through semi-structured video interviews between May and July 2020. Interviews were analysed using Framework analysis. Results: Key changes that were implemented in wave one reported at whole trust level included: a new acute staffing level, redeploying nurses, increasing the visibility of nursing leadership, new staff wellbeing initiatives, new roles created to support families and various training initiatives. Two main themes emerged from the interviews at division, ward/department and individual nurse level: impact of leadership, and impact on the delivery of nursing care. Conclusions: Leadership through a crisis is essential for the protective effect of nurses emotional wellbeing. While nursing leadership was made more visible during wave one of the pandemic and processes were in place to increase communication, system-level challenges resulting in negative experiences existed. By identifying these challenges, it has been possible to overcome them during wave two by employing different leadership styles, to support nurse wellbeing.","Phillips, N.; Hughes, L.; Vindrola-Padros, C.; Petrella, A.; Fern, L.

As a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many health care services have adopted new digital solutions, which rely on phone and internet connectivity. However, persons who are digitally inaccessible, such as those experiencing poverty or homelessness, are often unable to use these services. In response to this newly highlighted social disparity known as “digital health inequity,” emergency physicians at the University Health Network in Toronto, Canada, initiated a program called PHONE-CONNECT (Phones for Healthier Ontarians iN EDs – COvid NEeds met by Cellular Telephone). This novel approach attempts to improve patients’ access to health care, information, and social services, as well as improve their ability to adhere to public health directives (social isolation and contact tracing).

The virus itself, as well as the related political decisions, intensified an increasing feeling of fear in billions of people worldwide. However, while some people remained unperturbed, others experienced panic over the current situation. In order to investigate individual differences in the perceptions, emotions and behaviors in response to the Coronavirus pandemic, an online survey was conducted between 6th and 27th of March 2020. Participants included 7309 individuals from 96 countries, who provided information on socio-demographics, personality, political orientation and general life satisfaction. To determine the specificity of fear of Coronavirus, we also investigated fear related to two other current political issues: the refugee and the climate crises. Overall, in parallel with the escalation of the pandemic, fear of Coronavirus increased significantly over the 22-day period, with the strongest predictors being the personality variable neuroticism, as well as education, sex and being an at-risk person. A detailed longitudinal analysis of the largest sample, Germany, revealed that political orientation was also an important predictor of fear of Coronavirus. Specifically, conservatives were more afraid of Coronavirus than liberals. However, as the perceived threat of the virus increased, the influence of political orientation disappeared, whereas personality remained a stable predictor. The pattern of results regarding the perceived threat of the refugee and climate crises painted a different picture: political orientation was by far the best predictor, more important even than personality. Conservatives were more worried about the refugees, and liberals about climate change. Cross-cultural analyses showed pronounced differences between countries, dependent on the crisis. Nonetheless, the importance of personality for the prediction of fear of Coronavirus remained stable over time and across the world within the investigated 22-day period.","Lippold, Julia V.; Laske, Julia I.; Hogeterp, Svea A.; Duke, Éilish; Grünhage, Thomas; Reuter, Martin",Front Psychol,122,16

Understanding the persistence of immune responses in asymptomatic individuals merit special attention because of their importance in controlling the spread of the infections. We here studied the antibody and T cell responses, and a wide range of inflammation markers, in 56 SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positive individuals, identified by a population screen after the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These, mostly asymptomatic individuals, were reanalyzed 7-8 months after their infection together with 115 age-matched seronegative controls. We found that 7-8 months after the infection their antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid (N) protein declined whereas we found no decrease in the antibodies to Spike receptor-binding domain (S-RBD) when compared to the findings at seropositivity identification. In contrast to antibodies to N protein, the antibodies to S-RBD correlated with the viral neutralization capacity and with CD4(+) T cell responses as measured by antigen-specific upregulation of CD137 and CD69 markers. Unexpectedly we found the asymptomatic antibody-positive individuals to have increased serum levels of S100A12, TGF-alpha, IL18, and OSM, the markers of activated macrophages-monocytes, suggesting long-term persistent inflammatory effect associated with the viral infection in asymptomatic individuals.

RNAi has been widely applied in gene functional analysis, and as a potential therapeutic strategy in viral diseases, drug target discovery, and cancer therapy. Among the factors which may compromise inhibition efficiency, how to design siRNAs with high efficiency and high specificity to its target gene is critical.

We examined the degree to which care has moved to remote approaches, eliciting clinician and patient perspectives on what is appropriate for ongoing remote delivery. METHODS: Using an online research platform, we conducted a survey and consensus-building process involving clinicians and patients with COPD. RESULTS: Fifty-five clinicians and 19 patients responded. The majority of clinicians felt able to assess symptom severity (n=52, 95%), reinforce smoking cessation (n=46, 84%) and signpost to other healthcare resources (n=44, 80%). Patients reported that assessing COPD severity and starting new medications were being addressed through remote care. Forty-three and 31 respondents participated in the first and second consensus-building rounds, respectively. When asked to rate the appropriateness of using remote delivery for specific care activities, respondents reached consensus on 5 of 14 items: collecting information about COPD and overall health status (77%), providing COPD education and developing a self-management plan (74%), reinforcing smoking cessation (81%), deciding whether patients should seek in-person care (72%) and initiating a rescue pack (76%). CONCLUSION: Adoption of remote care delivery appears high, with many care activities partially or completely delivered remotely.

During the ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), most patients with COVID-19 who are symptomatic have used oseltamivir. Considering its popular and important role as an antiviral drug, it is necessary to evaluate oseltamivir in the treatment of COVID-19. Objective To evaluate the effect of oseltamivir against COVID-19. Methods Swiss-model was used to construct the structure of the N-terminal RNA-binding domain (NRBD) of the nucleoprotein (NC), papain-like protease (PLpro), and RNA-directed RNA polymerase (RdRp) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). TM-align program was performed to compare the structure of the viral proteins with the structure of the neuraminidase of influenza A. Molecular docking was used to analyze the theoretical possibility of effective binding of oseltamivir with the active centers of the viral proteins. In vitro study was used to evaluate the antiviral efficiency of oseltamivir against SARS-CoV-2. By clinical case analysis, we statistically evaluated whether the history of oseltamivir use influenced the progression of the disease. Results The structures of NRBD, PLpro, and RdRp were built successfully. The result from TM-align suggested that the S protein, NRBD, 3C-like protease (3CLpro), PLPrO, and RdRp were structurally similar to the influenza A neuraminidase, with TM-scores of 0.30077, 0.19254, 0.28766, 0.30666, and 0.34047, respectively. Interestingly, the active center of 3CL pro was found to be similar to the active center from the neuraminidase of influenza A. Through an analysis of molecular docking, we discovered that oseltamivir carboxylic acid was more favorable to bind to the active site of 3CLpro effectively, but its inhibitory effect was not strong compared with the positive group. Finally, we used in vitro study and retrospective case analysis to verify our speculations. We found that oseltamivir is ineffective against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro study and the clinical use of oseltamivir did not improve the patients’ symptoms and signs and did not slow the disease progression. Conclusions We consider that oseltamivir isn’t suitable for the treatment of COVID-19. During the outbreak of novel coronavirus, when oseltamivir is not effective for the patients after they take it, health workers should be highly vigilant about the possibility of COVID-19.","Tan, Qi; Duan, Limin; Ma, YanLing; Wu, Feng; Huang, Qi; Mao, Kaimin; Xiao, Wenjing; Xia, Hui; Zhang, Shujing; Zhou, E.; Ma, Pei; Song, Siwei; Li, YuMei; Zhao, Zilin; Sun, Yice; Li, Zeyu; Geng, Wei; Yin, Zengrong; Jin, Yang",Bioorg Chem,122,16

Within twelve hrs after cell cultures were initiated, cytoplasmic vacuoles appeared in many of the RPTEC. The RPTEC henceforth deteriorated rapidly. Since SV40 induces the formation of cytoplasmic vacuoles, this batch of RPTEC was rejected for the SV40 study. Nevertheless, we sought the likely cause(s) of the deterioration of the RPTEC as part of our technology development efforts. METHODS: Adventitious viruses in the RPTEC were isolated and/or detected and identified by isolation in various indicator cell lines, observation of cytopathology, an immunoflurorescence assay, electron microscopy, PCR, and sequencing. RESULTS: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) was detected in some RPTEC by cytology, an immunofluorescence assay, and PCR. Human Herpesvirus 6B was detected by PCR of DNA extracted from the RPTEC, but was not isolated. Human coronavirus NL63 was isolated and identified by RT-PCR and sequencing, and its replication in a fresh batch of RPTEC and another type of primary human kidney cells was confirmed. CONCLUSIONS: At least 3 different adventitious viruses were present in the batch of contaminated RPTEC. Whereas we are unable to determine whether the original RPTEC were pre-infected prior to their separation from other kidney cells, or had gotten contaminated with HCoV-NL63 from an ill laboratory worker during their preparation for commercial sale, our findings are a reminder that human-derived biologicals should always be considered as potential sources of infectious agents. Importantly, HCoV-NL63 replicates to high titers in some primary human kidney cells.","Lednicky, John A; Waltzek, Thomas B; McGeehan, Elizabeth; Loeb, Julia C; Hamilton, Sara B; Luetke, Maya C",Virol J,122,19

It is a hyperinflammatory complication observed to be comorbid with a variety of autoimmune diseases, including adult-onset Still’s disease and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Macrophage activation syndrome is less commonly detected in adult patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, which, if untreated, can be fatal, though determining the optimum treatment strategy is still a challenge. CASE PRESENTATION: Herein, we report a case of macrophage activation syndrome in a 33-year-old Egyptian female as an unusual complication of a systemic lupus erythematosus flare in adult patients. Our patient was initially treated with a combination of intravenous methylprednisolone pulse therapy and intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, which was followed by a course of oral prednisolone and oral cyclosporine with little response. Switching from oral prednisone to intravenous dexamethasone sodium phosphate showed a more favorable clinical and biochemical response. CONCLUSION: Macrophage activation syndrome is less commonly detected in adult patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. Our case demonstrates that dexamethasone sodium phosphate can be a successful alternative treatment for patients with systemic lupus erythematosus complicated by macrophage activation syndrome in whom the response to pulse methylprednisolone was inadequate to manage their illness, proving to be remarkably effective in a relatively short time frame.","Gouda, Wesam; Alsaqabi, Faisal; Moshrif, Abdelhfeez; Abbas, Awad S.; Abdel-Aziz, Tarek M.; Islam, Md Asiful",J Med Case Rep,122,16

For this ELISA, undiluted test sera are used to block the binding of an anti-IBRV gIII monoclonal antibody (mAbgIII)-horseradish peroxidase (HRPO) conjugate to gIII antigen. TMB substrate is used for color development. Negative S/N values (defined as the absorbance at 650 nm of test sera/absorbance at 650 nm of negative control sera) of >0.80 were obtained with immune sera from gnotobiotic cattle immunized with several bovine viruses, with bovine antisera to bovine herpesvirus-2, and vesicular stomatitis virus, with porcine antisera to pseudorabies virus and parvovirus, and with normal sera from heterologous species. Negative S/N values were also obtained with sera from rabbits twice vaccinated with IBRV(NG)dltkdlgIII. However, the S/N values became positive (S/N <0.8) 10 to 17 days after the rabbits were challenge exposed to virulent IBRV(Cooper). Most of 116 sera (84%) from feedlot cattle with virus neutralization (VN) titers of < 1:2 or < 1:4 had negative S/N values >0.8, but 18 sera with negative VN titers had positive S/N values, consistent with observations indicating that an IBRV outbreak was occurring in one of the feedlot herds. Thirty nine sera (98%) from feedlot cattle with VN titers of 1:2 to 1:128 had positive S/N values (<0.8). One serum with a VN titer of 1:2 had a borderline (±) S/N value of 0.81.

The aim of the present study was to delineate the prevalence of thromboembolic events and the current status of prophylactic anticoagulation therapy in patients with COVID-19 in Japan. METHODS: Between February 1 and August 31, 2020, we performed a dual-center, retrospective cohort study based on data obtained from the medical charts of COVID-19 patients admitted to healthcare facilities in Japan. The primary outcome was any thromboembolic events, including pulmonary embolism (PE), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke and other systemic thromboemboli. RESULTS: During the study period, we extracted 628 consecutive patients admitted for COVID-19. Prophylactic anticoagulant therapy was administered in 63 (10%) patients of whom 20 (31.7%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Thromboembolic events occurred in 18 (2.9%) patients (14.3% of patients in ICU and 2.2% of patients in the general wards). DVT were detected in 13 (2.1%) patients, PE in 11 (1.8%), and both DVT and PE in 6 (0.96%). An increasing prevalence in thromboembolic events was noted with progression in clinical severity. Overall in-hospital mortality was 4.8%. CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic anticoagulation therapy was administered in only 10% of all hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The prevalence of any thromboembolic events was 2.9% in COVID-19 patients with most events occurring in severe and critical patients. Therefore, prophylactic anticoagulation therapy may be warranted in severe and critical patients but in asymptomatic to moderate patients the practice remains controversial.","Fujiwara, Sho; Nakajima, Mikio; Kaszynski, Richard H.; Fukushima, Kazuaki; Tanaka, Masaru; Yajima, Keishiro; Kobayashi, Taiichiro; Sekiya, Noritaka; Yamamoto, Yasuhiro; Miwa, Maki; Ishihata, Ayaka; Yamauchi, Yuko; Yamamoto, Kazuo; Goto, Hideaki; Imamura, Akifumi",J Infect Chemother,122,1

METHODS: We enrolled 43 lung cancer patients and 21 healthy subjects that underwent exhaled breath condensate and bronchial brushing collection. The fungal incidence and nature of sample collected were analysed by using a selected media for Aspergillus species. RESULTS: For the first time we were able to analyse the fungal microbioma of the exhaled breath condensate. 27.9% of lung cancer patients showed a presence of Aspergillus niger, or A. ochraceus or Penicillium ssp. while none of the healthy subjects did so.

It is important to understand patient health-related behaviors and perceptions to guide public health vaccination strategies. OBJECTIVES: To examine perceptions of COVID-19 and vaccination beliefs, and identify predictors of intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine in the US. METHODS: A cross-sectional, web-based survey guided by the Health Belief Model was conducted using a web-based Qualtrics survey panel of US adults. The main outcome was the intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine if offered. Additional measures included: demographics, perceptions of COVID-19 severity, risk and susceptibility, views of a potential COVID-19 vaccine, virus and vaccine information sources, vaccine beliefs and behaviors, and seasonal flu vaccine history. RESULTS: A total of 1,047 complete responses were included. Females had lower odds of intending to receive the COVID-19 vaccine than males (AOR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.36 – 0.80). Those with a two-year degree/some college had lower odds of intending to receive the COVID-19 vaccine compared to those with a high school degree/GED (AOR = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.36 – 0.97). Respondents who perceived the severity of the virus to be higher, perceived a greater COVID-19 vaccine benefit, and perceived greater general vaccine benefits had higher odds of intending to receive a COVID-19 vaccine (AOR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.09 – 1.91; AOR = 2.82, 95% CI: 2.24 – 3.56; AOR = 1.77, 95% CI 1.41 – 2.21, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine varied across demographics, perceived virus severity, COVID-19 vaccine and general vaccine beliefs. Successful implementation of a COVID-19 immunization strategy by healthcare providers and public health officials will need to incorporate diverse COVID-19 vaccination education strategies tailored to patients' health beliefs.","Coe, Antoinette B.; Elliott, Marissa H.; Gatewood, Sharon B.S.; Goode, Jean-Venable R.; Moczygemba, Leticia R.",Res Social Adm Pharm,122,1

Also, a 19% reduction in NO(2) was observed during the 2020-lockdown as compared to the same period during 2019. The top cities where NO(2) reduction occurred were New Delhi (61.74%), Delhi (60.37%), Bangalore (48.25%), Ahmedabad (46.20%), Nagpur (46.13%), Gandhinagar (45.64) and Mumbai (43.08%) with less reduction in coastal cities. The temporal analysis revealed a progressive decrease in NO(2) for all seven cities during the 2020 lockdown period. Results also suggested spatial differences, i.e., as the distance from the city center increased, the NO(2) levels decreased exponentially. In contrast, to the decreased NO(2) observed for most of the cities, we observed an increase in NO(2) for cities in Northeast India during the 2020 lockdown period and attribute it to vegetation fires. The NO(2) temporal patterns matched the AOD signal; however, the correlations were poor. Overall, our results highlight COVID-19 impacts on NO(2), and the results can inform pollution mitigation efforts across different cities of India.","Vadrevu, Krishna Prasad; Eaturu, Aditya; Biswas, Sumalika; Lasko, Kristofer; Sahu, Saroj; Garg, J.

In addition to the treatment of COVID-19 patients, universities and other acute care hospitals had to provide emergency medical care, including for patients undergoing trauma surgery. The challenge was that no reliable planning figures were available regarding the expected volume for such a crisis situation and therefore no reliable resource planning was possible in this respect. Therefore, the aim of this work was to record the incidence of polytrauma and other injuries during the pandemic crisis in a university trauma surgery clinic and to compare it with the years 2017–2019. METHODS: In this single-center study, a retrospective analysis of the injury incidence during calendar weeks with existing exit restrictions (12th–19th week) for the year 2020 for trauma surgery patients of a university hospital was performed. At first, the treatment of COVID-19 patients was recorded daily in order to objectify the burden and expenditure of inpatient treatment for these patients. Then, for the evaluation period from 20.03.2020 to 06.05.2020, the numbers of 1. polytrauma, 2. work-related accidents and 3. leisure-related trauma patients were recorded and compared with the numbers from 2017–2019 during the same period. RESULTS: In total, 118 patients were treated with COVID-19 as inpatients during the period under study, of which up to 43 patients had to be treated simultaneously in intensive care on 1 day. Overall, the number of polytrauma, work-related accidents and leisure-time accident patients was lower in 2020 than in the previous years. Nevertheless, with a decline of only −28% (22 ± 4.9 vs. 16), a considerable number of polytrauma patients were recorded, while all work-related accidents (44%, 304 ± 31.3 vs. 170) and also leisure-time accidents (39%, 173 ± 22.7 vs. 106) considerably decreased. In the group of leisure-time accidents, there was initially a remarkable decline in the number of cases per week after the initial restrictions began, but as the duration of the restrictions increased, the number per week has risen to the level of previous years. DISCUSSION: Even in exceptional situations such as the corona pandemic, there were a significant number of patients in need of acute treatment, especially polytrauma patients. This should be considered in the future in the event of similar exceptional situations in the inpatient care framework when providing trauma surgery care capacities.","Popp, Daniel; Worlicek, Michael; Koch, Matthias; Kerschbaum, Maximilian; Rupp, Markus; Schicho, Andreas; Künzig, Holger; Zimmermann, Markus; Pfeifer, Christian; Alt, Volker",Unfallchirurg,122,18

By engaging in an integration of qualitative research methodologies and phenomenology, we investigate the actual first-person experiences of interaction in the virtual worlds of the popular team-based esports practices Counter Strike: Global Offensive and League of Legends. Our analysis discloses how the practitioners’ interactions essentially depend on intercorporeality – understood as a form of reciprocity of bodily intentionality between the players. This is an intercorporeality that is present throughout the players’ performance, but which especially comes to the front when they engage in feinting. Acknowledging the intercorporeality integral to at least some esports practices helps fuzzying the sharp division between virtuality and embodied social understanding. Doing so highlights the fluidity of our embodied condition, and it raises interesting questions concerning the possibility of yet other forms of embodied sociality in a wider range of virtual formats in the world.","Ekdahl, David; Ravn, Susanne",Phenomenol Cogn Sci,122,21

Here, we investigate m6A modification of the SARS-CoV-2 gene in regulating the host cell innate immune response. Our data show that the SARS-CoV-2 virus has m6A modifications that are enriched in the 3′ end of the viral genome. We find that depletion of the host cell m6A methyltransferase METTL3 decreases m6A levels in SARS-CoV-2 and host genes, and m6A reduction in viral RNA increases RIG-I binding and subsequently enhances the downstream innate immune signaling pathway and inflammatory gene expression. METTL3 expression is reduced and inflammatory genes are induced in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). These findings will aid in the understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis and the design of future studies regulating innate immunity for COVID-19 treatment.","Li, Na; Hui, Hui; Bray, Bill; Gonzalez, Gwendolyn Michelle; Zeller, Mark; Anderson, Kristian G.; Knight, Rob; Smith, Davey; Wang, Yinsheng; Carlin, Aaron F.; Rana, Tariq M.",Cell Rep,122,29

To understand this process, we assess data from dengue national and municipal basins regarding population and demographics, transportation network, human mobility, and Ae. aegypti monitoring for the Brazilian state of Acre since the first recorded dengue case in the year 2000 to the year 2015. During this period, several changes in Acre’s transport infrastructure and urbanization have been started. To reconstruct the process of dengue introduction in Acre, we propose an analytic framework based on concepts used in malaria literature, namely vulnerability and receptivity, to inform risk assessments in dengue-free regions as well as network theory concepts for disease invasion and propagation. We calculate the probability of dengue importation to Acre from other Brazilian states, the evolution of dengue spread between Acrean municipalities and dengue establishment in the state. Our findings suggest that the landscape changes associated with human mobility have created favorable conditions for the establishment of dengue virus transmission in Acre. The revitalization of its major roads, as well as the increased accessibility by air to and within the state, have increased dengue vulnerability. Unplanned urbanization and population growth, as observed in Acre during the period of study, contribute to ideal conditions for Ae. aegypti mosquito establishment, increase the difficulty in mosquito control and consequently its local receptivity.","Lana, Raquel Martins; Gomes, Marcelo Ferreira da Costa; de Lima, Tiago França Melo; Honório, Nildimar Alves; Codeço, Cláudia Torres",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,122,16

Over the subsequent five months NPIs were eased in stages according to national strategy. Covid-19 spread throughout the country heterogeneously, reaching rural areas by July and peaking in July-August. Data on the impact of NPI policies on social and economic wellbeing and access to healthcare is limited. We therefore analysed how rural residents of three South African provinces changed their behaviour during the first epidemic wave. METHODS: The South African Population Research Infrastructure Network (SAPRIN) nodes in Mpumalanga (Agincourt), KwaZulu-Natal (AHRI) and Limpopo (DIMAMO) provinces conducted longitudinal telephone surveys among randomly sampled households from rural and peri-urban surveillance populations every 2-3 weeks. Interviews included questions on: Covid-19 knowledge and behaviours; health and economic impact of NPIs; and mental health. RESULTS: 2262 households completed 10,966 interviews between April and August 2020. By August, self-reported satisfaction with Covid-19 knowledge had risen from 48% to 85% and facemask use to over 95%. As selected NPIs were eased mobility increased, and economic losses and anxiety and depression symptoms fell. When Covid-19 cases spiked at one node in July, movement dropped rapidly, and missed daily medication rates doubled. Economic concerns and mental health symptoms were lower in households receiving a greater number of government-funded old-age pensions. CONCLUSIONS: South Africans reported complying with stringent Covid-19 NPIs despite the threat of substantial social, economic and health repercussions. Government-supported social welfare programmes appeared to buffer interruptions in income and healthcare access during local outbreaks. Epidemic control policies must be balanced against impacts on wellbeing in resource-limited settings and designed with parallel support systems where they threaten income and basic service access.","Harling, Guy; Gómez-Olivé, Francesc Xavier; Tlouyamma, Joseph; Mutevedzi, Tinofa; Kabudula, Chodziwadziwa Whiteson; Mahlako, Ruth; Singh, Urisha; Ohene-Kwofie, Daniel; Buckland, Rose; Ndagurwa, Pedzisai; Gareta, Dickman; Gunda, Resign; Mngomezulu, Thobeka; Nxumalo, Siyabonga; Wong, Emily B.; Kahn, Kathleen; Siedner, Mark J.; Maimela, Eric; Tollman, Stephen; Collinson, Mark; Herbst, Kobus",medRxiv,122,4

The new adaptive challenges faced at night were recurrent enough to amplify existing psychological variation in our species. Night-time is dangerous and mysterious, so it selects for individuals with higher tendencies for paranoia, risk-taking, and sociability (because of security in numbers). During night-time, individuals are generally tired and show decreased self-control and increased impulsive behaviors. The lower visibility during night-time favors the partial concealment of identity and opens more opportunities for disinhibition of self-interested behaviors. Indeed, individuals with an evening-oriented chronotype are more paranoid, risk-taking, extraverted, impulsive, promiscuous, and have higher antisocial personality traits. However, under some circumstances, such as respiratory pandemics, the psychobehavioral traits favored by the nocturnal niche might be counter-productive, increasing contagion rates of a disease that can evade the behavioral immune system because its disease cues are often nonexistent or mild. The eveningness epidemiological liability hypothesis presented here suggests that during the COVID-19 pandemic, the evening-oriented psychobehavioral profile can have collectively harmful consequences: there is a clash of core tendencies between the nocturnal chronotype and the recent viral transmission-mitigating safety guidelines and rules. The pandemic safety protocols disrupt much normal social activity, particularly at night when making new social contacts is desired. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is contagious even in presymptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, which enables it to mostly evade our evolved contagious disease avoidance mechanisms. A growing body of research has indirectly shown that individual traits interfering with social distancing and anti-contagion measures are related to those of the nocturnal chronotype. Indeed, some of the social contexts that have been identified as superspreading events occur at night, such as in restaurants, bars, and nightclubs. Furthermore, nocturnal environmental conditions favor the survival of the SARS-CoV-2 virus much longer than daytime conditions. We compare the eveningness epidemiological liability hypothesis with other factors related to non-compliance with pandemic safety protocols, namely sex, age, and life history. Although there is not yet a direct link between the nocturnal chronotype and non-compliance with pandemic safety protocols, security measures and future empirical research should take this crucial evolutionary mismatch and adaptive metaproblem into account, and focus on how to avoid nocturnal individuals becoming superspreaders, offering secure alternatives for nocturnal social activities.","Varella, Marco Antonio Correa; Luoto, Severi; Soares, Rafael Bento da Silva; Valentova, Jaroslava Varella",Front Psychol,122,8

We aim to describe prehospital healthcare providers’ resuscitative efforts for OHCA cases and their definitive outcomes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective cross-sectional study included all OHCA cases between April and June 2021 across all regions in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Demographic variables, response times, CPR providers, initial rhythm, use of AED/Defibrillator, medical interventions, ROSC data, and dispatch codes were extracted from a central electronic platform. RESULTS: A total of 1307 OHCA cases were included in this study, males constituted 65% and 42% were ≥65 years. Although the median response time to initiate CPR was 13 min, 11% of OHCA cases had a response time between 0 and 6 min. About 75% of CPR was provided on scene by BLS units, 78% of OHCA cases had asystole as their initial rhythm, an AED/Defibrillator was used more than 90% of the time for pulseless VT/VF rhythm, and ROSC was achieved in 8% of OHCA patients. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, maintaining resuscitative efforts for OHCA continues in KSA. Closing knowledge gaps in the community and a better description of OHCA for the dispatcher could guide dispatch-assisted CPR and minimize OHCA response times.","Alsofayan, Yousef M; Althunayyan, Saqer M; Mohamed, Mohamed A; Alhabeeb, Saud H; Altuwaijri, Mohammad I; Alhajjaj, Fahad S; Alowais, Jalal M",Open Access Emerg Med,122,1

Beliefs and attitudes of clinicians have the potential to shape clinical research involving pregnant women. This study evaluates the current perspectives of Canadian physicians on the participation of pregnant women in COVID-19 clinical trials. Methods An anonymous 22-item online questionnaire was sent to Canadian physicians belonging to four Canadian professional associations. Physicians were surveyed regarding the inclusion of pregnant women in COVID-19 trials using a semi-quantitative approach with multiple choice and open-ended questions. Descriptive statistics were performed. Themes from free-text answers were extracted using a semi-inductive approach. Results 202 physicians agreed to participate, 168 of which completed the survey. The majority of respondents expressed support for including pregnant women in COVID-19 trials (119/165; 72%), especially those investigating therapies with a prior safety record in pregnancy (139/164; 85%). In addition, 66% (107/161) of physicians responded that including pregnant women in COVID-19 trials was urgent. The main barriers to including pregnant women in COVID-19 trials were perceived unwillingness of pregnant patients to take part in clinical trials, perceived unwillingness of treating teams to offer participation, burden of regulatory approval, and a general ‘culture of exclusion’ of pregnant women from clinical trials. Conclusions Most physicians surveyed were supportive of the inclusion of pregnant women in COVID-19 trials of intervention. Importantly, we describe why some physicians may be reluctant to include pregnant women in clinical trials and identify important barriers to be addressed for the appropriate participation of pregnant women in clinical research.","Trahan, Marie-Julie; Cumyn, Annabelle; Cheng, Matthew; McDonald, Emily; Lapinsky, Stephen; Daneman, Nick; Abenhaim, Haim; Malhame, Isabelle",Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada,122,21

This work introduces an expression to provide estimates of the number of remaining susceptible in a region using the reported number of deaths. Conclusions: any region with fewer than 2.5 deaths per thousand individuals will continue accumulating deaths until this average is achieved, and the infection rate will exceed the removal rate until the number of deaths is about two deaths per thousand, when herd immunity is reached.

It is connected wirelessly to any type of smartphone and it is used by asthma patients to self-monitor progress of their clinical condition. Thus evaluation of the SPF’s ability to provide accurate PEF values is essential. The aim of this pilot work was to provide preliminary in-vivo data about the measurement agreement between the SPF and a lab spirometer for a first time. METHODS: PEF measurements were obtained by 9 healthy adults as this pilot work was terminated earlier than it was expected due to COVID-19 restrictions. PEF readings (n=27) were recorded by the comparable devices at the same time during three different expiratory maneuvers performed by each participant. The Bland and Altman plot was used to assess the agreement. RESULTS: Good agreement between the SPF and the lab spirometer was found with the mean bias being estimated 0.29 L/min. The lower and upper limits of agreement (LOA) were estimated 30.03 L/min and −30.61 L/min respectively. CONCLUSION: Due to a small sample size, no firm conclusions can be drawn regarding the SPF’s accuracy. However the current promising results encourage further testing in the future.","Sakkatos, Panagiotis; Williams, Andrew",Digit Health,122,33

However, minimal data have been published demonstrating tangible changes across multiple ECT centers. This article aimed to examine changes in ECT patients and ECT service delivery during the pandemic. METHODS We retrospectively assessed data collected on ECT patients within the Clinical Alliance and Research in Electroconvulsive Therapy and Related Treatments (CARE) Network during a 3-month period starting at the first COVID-19 restrictions in 2020 and compared data with predicted values based on the corresponding 3-month period in 2019. Mixed-effects repeated-measures analyses examined differences in the predicted and actual number of acute ECT courses started and the total number of acute ECT treatments given in 2020. Sociodemographic, clinical, treatment factors, and ECT service delivery factors were compared for 2020 and 2019. RESULTS Four Australian and 1 Singaporean site participated in the study. There were no significant differences between the predicted and actual number of acute ECT courses and total number of acute ECT treatments administered in 2020. During 2020, there were statistically significant increases in the proportion of patients requiring ECT under substitute consent and receiving ECT for urgent reasons compared with 2019. CONCLUSIONS This multisite empirical study is among the first that supports anecdotal reports of changes in the triaging and delivery of ECT during COVID-19. Results suggest that ECT was prioritized for the most severely ill patients.

Participants (N = 60) were randomly assigned to read vignettes set in either distance learning or in-person classroom contexts. Then, participants completed measures about discipline and COVID-19. Results indicated there was an interaction between context and the sequence of vignettes on providers' troubled feelings and endorsements of discipline. Providers showed heightened troubled feelings and endorsements of discipline severity in the distance learning context, as compared to an in-person context, as vignettes progressed. Additionally, the more providers feared COVID-19, the more they felt troubled over the course of the vignettes across conditions.

The human nervous system is tuned to detect safety and danger, integrating body and brain responses via the autonomic nervous system. Shifts in brain-body states toward danger responses can compromise mental health. For those who have experienced prior potentially traumatic events, the autonomic threat response system may be sensitive to new dangers and these threat responses may mediate the association between prior adversity and current mental health. Method: The present study collected survey data from adult U.S. residents (n = 1,666; 68% female; Age M = 46.24, SD = 15.14) recruited through websites, mailing lists, social media, and demographically-targeted sampling collected between March and May 2020. Participants reported on their adversity history, subjective experiences of autonomic reactivity, PTSD and depression symptoms, and intensity of worry related to the COVID-19 pandemic using a combination of standardized questionnaires and questions developed for the study. Formal mediation testing was conducted using path analysis and structural equation modeling. Results: Respondents with prior adversities reported higher levels of destabilized autonomic reactivity, PTSD and depression symptoms, and worry related to COVID-19. Autonomic reactivity mediated the relation between adversity and all mental health variables (standardized indirect effect range for unadjusted models: 0.212–0.340; covariate-adjusted model: 0.183–0.301). Discussion: The data highlight the important role of autonomic regulation as an intervening variable in mediating the impact of adversity on mental health. Because of the important role that autonomic function plays in the expression of mental health vulnerability, brain-body oriented therapies that promote threat response reduction should be investigated as possible therapeutic targets.","Kolacz, Jacek; Dale, Lourdes P.; Nix, Evan J.; Roath, Olivia K.; Lewis, Gregory F.; Porges, Stephen W.",Front Psychiatry,122,26

Due to fear of infection, government and local authorities in China immediately closed academic institutions and tried to find survival techniques to cope with market turbulence. COVID-19 was present in China at the end of 2019. However, little attention has been paid by researchers to coping strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic, and few measures were taken to assess the coping strategies of university students, specifically following the closure of their institutions. To address this gap, this study attempted to discover the coping strategies of Chinese students during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. Methods: We conducted an online survey using a semi-structured questionnaire with a simple random sampling technique and received 559 responses. The survey questions captured information about students’ lives during the COVID-19 outbreak, actions to control anxiety, and what students care about during the pandemic. The associations between coping strategies used and levels of anxiety were tested using analysis of variance (ANOVA) procedures. SPSS Statistics v27 was used for statistical analysis in this study. Results: The university students reported that coping strategies and survival techniques were required due to high levels of anxiety and psychological pressure during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most of the respondents reported the prompt closure of their academic institutions due to COVID-19. Psychological concerns, such as lack of sleep, emotional support, mental support and social appeal, were also reported. Conclusions: This is one of the very first studies on coping strategies for anxiety in China. The study reveals that university students employ a number of coping strategies in relation to COVID-19, but also suggests a need to strengthen such strategies in this population.

As a student progresses, they are required to communicate the results of their experiments with their instructors in a manner that other scientists would understand. This style of communication is stressed throughout their entire training. But what happens when the need arises to communicate with interested nonscientific audiences? Scientific discourse has typically been considered what philosopher of language Mikhail Bakhtin termed an “authoritative discourse,”—a discourse that “binds us, quite independent of any power it might have to persuade us internally,” whose hegemony is traditionally a priori, unquestioned. However, within the public realm, that authority is in crisis. There is an unsettling rise of anti-scientific counter-discourses such as the anti-vaccine movement, the growing Flat Earth movement, climate change denialism, and a host of other “movements” grounded in either pseudo-science or an outright dismissal of scientific authority. In response to this crisis, scientists and educators have called for more attention to improving scientific literacy among the general public. By examining the generic conventions of scientific discourse using the theories of Mikhail Bakhtin, we hope to point out some of the barriers causing the current crisis in scientific authority.","Nichols, Marcia D.; Petzold, Andrew M.",Cult Stud Sci Educ,122,16

Deceased COVID-19 patients had higher levels of circulating, catalytically active sPLA2 group IIA (sPLA2-IIA), with a median value that was 9.6-fold higher than that for patients with mild disease and 5.0-fold higher than the median value for survivors of severe COVID-19. Elevated sPLA2-IIA levels paralleled several indices of COVID-19 disease severity (e.g., kidney dysfunction, hypoxia, multiple organ dysfunction). A decision tree generated by machine learning identified sPLA2-IIA levels as a central node in the stratification of patients who died from COVID-19. Random forest analysis and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator-based (LASSO-based) regression analysis additionally identified sPLA2-IIA and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) as the key variables among 80 clinical indices in predicting COVID-19 mortality. The combined PLA-BUN index performed significantly better than did either one alone. An independent cohort (n = 154) confirmed higher plasma sPLA2-IIA levels in deceased patients compared with levels in plasma from patients with severe or mild COVID-19, with the PLA-BUN index-based decision tree satisfactorily stratifying patients with mild, severe, or fatal COVID-19. With clinically tested inhibitors available, this study identifies sPLA2-IIA as a therapeutic target to reduce COVID-19 mortality.","Snider, Justin M; You, Jeehyun Karen; Wang, Xia; Snider, Ashley J; Hallmark, Brian; Zec, Manja M; Seeds, Michael C; Sergeant, Susan; Johnstone, Laurel; Wang, Qiuming; Sprissler, Ryan; Carr, Tara F; Lutrick, Karen; Parthasarathy, Sairam; Bime, Christian; Zhang, Hao Helen; Luberto, Chiara; Kew, Richard R; Hannun, Yusuf A; Guerra, Stefano; McCall, Charles E; Yao, Guang; Del Poeta, Maurizio; Chilton, Floyd H",J. clin. invest,122,1

This has led to the birth of new search tools specialized in different domains, because classical information retrieval models have trouble dealing with the special characteristics of some of these domains. Evidence-based Medicine is a case of a complex domain where classical information retrieval models can help search engines retrieve documents by considering the presence or absence of terms, but these must be complemented with other specific strategies which allow retrieving and ranking documents including the best current evidence and methodological quality. OBJECTIVE: The goal is to present a ranking algorithm able to select the best documents for clinicians considering aspects related to the relevance and the quality of said documents. METHODS: In order to assess the effectiveness of this proposal, an experimental methodology has been followed by using Medline as a data set and the Cochrane Library as a gold standard. RESULTS: Applying the evaluation methodology proposed, and after submitting 40 queries on the platform developed, the MAP (Mean Average Precision) obtained was 20.26%.

Our aim was to determine whether corticosteroids improve the outcomes of our patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: Our retrospective, single centre cohort study included consecutive patients hospitalized for moderate to severe COVID-19 pneumonia between March 15 and April 15 2020. An early short course of corticosteroids was given during the second phase of the study. The primary composite endpoint was the need for mechanical ventilation or mortality within 28 days of admission. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to estimate the propensity score, i.e. the probability of each patient receiving corticosteroid therapy based on the initial variables. RESULTS: About 120 consecutive patients were included, 39 in the “corticosteroids group”, 81 in the “no corticosteroids group”; their mean ages (±SD) were 66.4 ± 14.1 and 66.1 ± 15.2 years, respectively. Mechanical ventilation-free survival at 28 days was higher in the “corticosteroids group” than in the “no corticosteroids group” (71% and 29% of cases, respectively, p < .0001). The effect of corticosteroids was confirmed with HR .28 (95%CI .10–.79), p = .02. In older and comorbid patients who were not eligible for intensive care, the effect of corticosteroid therapy was also beneficial (HR .36 (95%CI .16–.80), p = .01). CONCLUSION: A short course of corticosteroids reduced the risks of death or mechanical ventilation in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 pneumonia in all patients and also in older and comorbid patients not eligible for intensive care.","Comparon, Celine; Boubaya, Marouane; Sritharan, Nanthara; Dournon, Nathalie; Duchemann, Boris; Tine, Samir; Lopez-Sublet, Marilucy; Mongin, Marie; Giroux-Leprieur, Bénédicte; Bloch-Queyrat, Coralie; Sigaux, Johanna; Cohen, Yves; Bohelay, Gérôme; Caux, Fréderic; Bihan, Hélène; Le Jeune, Sylvain; Abad, Sébastien; Levy, Vincent; Dhote, Robin",Infectious diseases,122,28

In this study, a large‐scale serological survey of antibodies against SARS‐CoV‐2 in dogs and cats was conducted during the first and second waves of COVID‐19 outbreaks in Thailand, from April to December 2020. A total of 3215 serum samples were collected from dogs (n = 2102) and cats (n = 1113) living in Bangkok and in the vicinities. Serum samples were tested for SARS‐CoV‐2 antibodies by using an indirect multispecies enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Positive and suspected samples were additionally tested for neutralizing antibodies by the surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT). The indirect ELISA results showed that 1.66% (35 out of 2103) of dogs and 0.36% (four out of 1112) of cats were positive for SARS‐CoV‐2 antibodies. The sVNT results showed that all ELISA‐positive and suspected samples were negative for neutralizing antibodies. Positive serum samples (35 dogs and four cats) were obtained from clinically healthy animals and animals with mild respiratory signs aged <1–13 years living in Bangkok and Samutprakarn Provinces.

The disease caused by this virus is called COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). The virus is transmitted between humans and the outbreak was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020. Coagulopathy is a common abnormality in patients with COVID-19 due to inflammation, hypoxia, immobilisation, endothelial damage and diffuse intravascular coagulation. However, the data on this topic are still limited. Here we report the case of a man presenting with pneumonia complicated by bilateral pulmonary embolism LEARNING POINTS: SARS-CoV-2 is a novel infectious agent that causes COVID-19, which can manifest in several ways, affecting endothelial cells and most organs. There is growing evidence that SARS-CoV-2-mediated endothelial damage is due to direct viral injury and the systemic inflammatory response, possibly together with a cytokine storm. As endothelial damage can manifest as thromboembolic disease, such as pulmonary thromboembolism, appropriate anti-thrombotic preventive strategies should be followed, and proper screening and treatment for thromboembolic complications should be implemented.","Tamburello, Adriana; Bruno, Giovanni; Marando, Marco",Eur J Case Rep Intern Med,122,16

The downstream ORF 1b is expressed by a mechanism involving (−1) ribosomal frameshifting. Translation of mRNA 1, which is thought to be equivalent to the viral genomic RNA, results in the synthesis of two large polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab. These polyproteins contain motifs characteristic of papain-like and 3C-like proteinases, RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, helicases, and metal-binding proteins. In this study, we have produced pp1ab-specific monoclonal antibodies and have used them to detect an intracellular, 105-kDa viral polypeptide that contains the putative RNA polymerase domain. Furthermore, usingtranscleavage assays with bacterially expressed HCV 229E 3C-like proteinase, we have demonstrated that the 105-kDa polypeptide is released from pp1ab by cleavage at the dipeptide bonds Gln-4068/Ser-4069 and Gln-4995/Ala-4996. These data contribute to the characterization of coronavirus 3C-like proteinase-mediated processing of pp1ab and provide the first identification of an HCV 229E ORF 1ab-encoded polypeptide in virus-infected cells.","Grötzinger, Carsten; Heusipp, Gerhard; Ziebuhr, John; Harms, Ute; Süss, Jochen; Siddell, Stuart G.",Virology,122,1

Cependant, les surinfections et co-infections bactériennes associées aux coronavirus sont peu décrites, et concernent principalement les patients de soins intensifs. Matériels et méthodes Une étude observationnelle rétrospective monocentrique a été menée dans notre CHU du 26/02/2020 au 22/04/2020. Ont été inclus tous les patients hospitalisés pour une COVID-19 (PCR respiratoire positive à SARS-CoV-2 ou atteinte scannographique compatible) hors service de réanimation et présentant une infection bactérienne documentée par un prélèvement bactériologique positif parmi: prélèvement respiratoire (ECBC, aspiration bronchique, LBA), hémoculture, antigénurie légionnelle ou pneumocoque, ou PCR nasopharyngée (Bordetella pertussis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae et légionnelle). Les données bactériologiques ont été obtenues par les laboratoires de bactériologie et virologie et les données cliniques recueillies à partir du dossier médical des patients. Résultats Au total, 2710 prélèvements ont été réalisés chez 778 patients hospitalisés: 957 hémocultures, 169 ECBC, 3 aspirations bronchiques, 2 LBA, 537 PCR nasopharyngées, 517 antigénuries légionnelle et 525 antigénuries pneumocoque. Quarante et un prélèvements étaient positifs (1,5 %) dont quatorze ont été considérés comme une colonisation par les cliniciens. Vingt neuf prélèvements positifs (1,1 %) ont été considérés comme pathogènes chez 27 patients (3,5 %): 15 ECBC, 2 aspirations bronchiques, 1 LBA, 7 hémocultures, 2 antigénuries et 4 PCR nasopharyngées. Parmi les 27 patients, 18 (66,7 %) avaient des comorbidités dont 10 (37 %) une pathologie respiratoire chronique. Huit patients (29,6 %) étaient sous traitement immunosuppresseur au long cours et 15 (55,6 %) ont reçu des corticoïdes ou autres traitements immunomodulateurs pour la COVID-19. Le delais entre l’apparition des symptômes de COVID-19 et la survenue de la surinfection bactérienne était en moyenne de 11jours. Les arguments en faveur d’une surinfection étaient l’augmentation des besoins en oxygène (n =22, 81,5 %), la toux expectorante (n= 20, 74,0 %) ou la modification de la toux (n =5, 18,5 %) et la présence de fièvre (n= 5, 18,5 %). Un patient avait un tableau de sepsis. Les pathogènes les plus fréquemment retrouvés nétaient: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n =8, 29,6 %), Staphylococcus aureus (n =5, 18,5 %), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n =4, 14,8 %) et Enterococcus faecalis (n =3, 11,1 %). Quatre patients (0,5 %) avaient une co-infection à bactérie intracellulaire: 2 à Bordetella pertussis et 2 à Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Aucune antigénurie légionnelle n’est revenue positive. Conclusion Le taux de surinfections et de co-infections bactériennes dans la COVID-19 semble faible. Ce faible taux est en faveur d’une utilisation limitée des antibiotiques dans la prise en charge de la COVID-19.","Husain, M.; Valayer, S.; Poey, N.; Rondinaud, E.; D’Humières, C.; Visseaux, B.; Deconinck, L.; Lescure, F.",Médecine et Maladies Infectieuses,122,5

On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. Since then, frontline healthcare professionals have been experiencing extremely stressful situations and damage to their physical and mental health. These adverse conditions cause stress and biochemical, hematological, and inflammatory changes, as well as oxidative damage, and could be potentially detrimental to the health of the individual. The study population consisted of frontline health professionals working in BHU in a city in southern Brazil. Among the 45 participants, two were infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus and were diagnosed using immunochromatographic tests such as salivary RT-LAMP and qRT-PCR. We also evaluated biochemical, hematological, inflammatory, and oxidative stress markers in the participants. The infected professionals (CoV-2-Prof) showed a significant increase in the levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), cholesterol, lactic dehydrogenase, lymphocytes, and monocytes. In this group, the levels of uric acid, triglycerides, leukocytes, neutrophils, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelets decreased. In the group of uninfected professionals (NoCoV-2-Prof), significant increase in HDL levels and the percentages of eosinophils and monocytes, was observed. Further, in this group, uric acid, LDH, triglyceride, and cholesterol levels, and the hematocrit count and mean corpuscular volume were significantly reduced. Both groups showed significant inflammatory activity with changes in the levels of C-reactive protein and mucoprotein. The NoCoV-2-Prof group showed significantly elevated plasma cortisol levels.

In a clinical study with healthy volunteers, levosimendan, a calcium sensitiser, was shown to improve neuromechanical efficiency and contractile function of the human diaphragm. We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral levosimendan in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, with a focus on respiratory function. METHODS The REFALS study is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial at 99 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis specialist centres in 14 countries worldwide. People with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis were eligible for participation if they were at least 18 years of age and had a sitting slow vital capacity (SVC) of 60-90% predicted. Participants were randomly assigned (2:1) by interactive web-response system to receive either levosimendan or placebo. The capsules for oral administration were identical in appearance to maintain blinding of participants and investigators. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in supine SVC at 12 weeks, assessed as the percentage of predicted normal sitting SVC. The key secondary endpoint was the combined assessment of function and survival (CAFS) up to 48 weeks. Analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population, comprising all participants who were randomly assigned. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03505021) and has been completed. An extension study (REFALS-ES; NCT03948178) has also been completed, but will be reported separately. FINDINGS Between June 21, 2018, and June 28, 2019, 871 people were screened for the study, of whom 496 were randomly assigned either levosimendan (n=329) or placebo (n=167). Participants were followed up between June 27, 2018 and June 26, 2020, for a median duration of 50·1 (IQR 37·5-51·1) weeks. The median duration of treatment was 47·9 (IQR 26·4-48·1) weeks. Change from baseline in supine SVC at 12 weeks was -6·73% with levosimendan and -6·99% with placebo, with no significant difference between the treatments (estimated treatment difference 0·26%, 95% CI -2·03 to 2·55, p=0·83). Similarly, at week 48, CAFS did not differ between treatment groups (least squares mean change from baseline 10·69, 95% CI -15·74 to 37·12; nominal p value=0·43). The most frequent adverse events were increased heart rate (106 [33%] of 326 receiving levosimendan vs 12 [7%] of 166 receiving placebo), fall (85 [26%] vs 48 [29%]), headache (93 [29%] vs 36 [22%]), and dyspnoea (59 [18%] vs 32 [19%]). 33 (10%) participants allocated levosimendan and 20 (12%) assigned placebo died during the trial, mainly due to respiratory failure or progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. INTERPRETATION Levosimendan was not superior to placebo in maintaining respiratory function in a broad population with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Although levosimendan was generally well tolerated, increased heart rate and headache occurred more frequently with levosimendan than with placebo. The possibility of a clinically relevant subgroup of responsive individuals requires further evaluation.

Here, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the antiviral materials and coatings that could be implemented for suppressing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 via contaminated surfaces. We discuss the mechanism of operation and effectivity of several types of inorganic and organic materials, in the bulk and nanomaterial form, and assess the possibility of implementing these as antiviral coatings. Toxicity and environmental concerns are also discussed for the presented approaches. Finally, we present future perspectives with regards to emerging antimicrobial technologies such as omniphobic surfaces and assess their potential in suppressing surface-mediated virus transfer. Although some of these emerging technologies have not yet been tested directly as antiviral coatings, they hold great potential for designing the next generation of antiviral surfaces.","Imani, Sara M.; Ladouceur, Liane; Marshall, Terrel; Maclachlan, Roderick; Soleymani, Leyla; Didar, Tohid F.",ACS Nano,122,5

Indeed, the number of antiviral mAbs developed in recent years has grown exponentially. Although their direct effects on viral blunting have been studied in detail, their potential immunomodulatory actions have been overlooked until recently. The ability of antiviral mAbs to modulate antiviral immune responses in infected organisms has recently been revealed. More specifically, upon recognition of their cognate antigens, mAbs form immune complexes (ICs) that can be recognized by the Fc receptors expressed on different immune cells of infected individuals. This binding may be followed by the modulation of the host immune responses. Harnessing this immunomodulatory property may facilitate improvements in the therapeutic potential of antiviral mAbs. This review focuses on the role of ICs formed with different viral determinants and mAbs in the induction of antiviral immune responses in the context of both passive immunotherapies and vaccination strategies. Potential deleterious effects of ICs on the host immune response are also discussed.","Lambour, Jennifer; Naranjo-Gomez, Mar; Piechaczyk, Marc; Pelegrin, Mireia",Emerg Microbes Infect,122,20

The role of boundary-spanning knowledge institutions in this context could be pivotal, not least in cities, where much of the pandemic has struck. ‘Urban observatories’ have emerged as an example of such institutions; harbouring great potential to produce and share knowledge supporting sustainable and equitable processes of recovery. Building on four ‘live’ case studies during the crisis of institutions based in Johannesburg, Karachi, Freetown and Bangalore, our research note aims to capture the role of these institutions, and what it means to span knowledge boundaries in the current crisis. We do so with an eye towards a better understanding of their knowledge mobilisation practices in contributing towards sustainable urban development. We highlight that the crisis offers a key window for urban observatories to play a progressive and effective role for sustainable and inclusive development. However, we also underline continuing challenges in these boundary knowledge dynamics: including issues of institutional trust, inequality of voices, collective memory, and the balance between normative and advisory roles for observatories.","Acuto, Michele; Dickey, Ariana; Butcher, Stephanie; Washbourne, Carla-Leanne",World Dev,122,1

The virus genome structure and evolution are positioned front and center for further understanding insights on vaccine development, monitoring of transmission trajectories, and prevention of zoonotic infections of new coronaviruses. Of particular interest are genomic elements Inverse Repeats (IRs), which maintain genome stability, regulate gene expressions, and are the targets of mutations. However, little research attention is given to the IR content analysis in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. In this study, we propose a geometric analysis method and using the method to investigate the distributions of IRs in SARS-CoV-2 and its related coronavirus genomes. The method represents each genomic IR sequence pair as a single point and constructs the geometric shape of the genome using the IRs. Thus, the IR shape can be considered as the signature of the genome. The genomes of different coronaviruses are then compared using the constructed IR shapes. The results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 genome, specifically, has an abundance of IRs, and the IRs in coronavirus genomes show an increase during evolution events.","Yin, Changchuan; Yau, Stephen S.-T.",J Theor Biol,122,24

Therefore, the SARS-CoV-2 S protein is a key therapeutic target, and prevention and treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have focused on the development of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (nAbs) that target this protein. In this review, we summarize the nAbs targeting SARS-CoV-2 proteins that have been developed to date, with a focus on the N-terminal domain and RBD of the S protein. We also describe the roles that binding affinity, neutralizing activity, and protection provided by these nAbs play in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 and discuss the potential to improve nAb efficiency against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants. This review provides important information for the development of effective nAbs with broad-spectrum activity against current and future SARS-CoV-2 strains.","Du, Lanying; Yang, Yang; Zhang, Xiujuan",Cell Mol Immunol,122,16

A total of 76 subjects (30–70 years of age) were recruited from the general population. The subjects were instructed to take one capsule per day of either EAP or a placebo for a period of 8 weeks. The duration of cold and flu symptoms, a primary variable in assessing effectiveness, and serum cytokine levels as well as WBC counts as secondary variables were also evaluated. RESULTS: EAP was associated with a statistically significant decrease in the duration of cold and flu symptoms, a primary variable in assessing effectiveness. Although cold and flu symptom levels were not significantly different at a significance level of 5%, the cold and flu symptom levels of the EAP group were less severe compared to the placebo group. No statistically significant changes of serum cytokine levels as well as WBC counts were observed.

COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) (i.e. plasma collected from individuals after their recovery from COVID-19) has emerged as a leading medical treatment for COVID-19. Studies to date support the safety—and increasingly the efficacy—of CCP to treat COVID-19. This has motivated large-scale procurement and transfusion of CCP, notably in the United States (US), where inventories of CCP have been attained, and government-supported stockpiling of CCP is underway. CCP is a therapy that could be implemented in LMICs. However, systemic and transfusion-specific challenges (e.g. capacity for donor mobilization and collections) impede local procurement of this resource in sufficient volumes to meet clinical demand. This raises the question as to whether there are strategies to facilitate sharing of CCP with LMICs and/or bolstering local capacity for collection to contend with the health crisis. While compelling, there are cost-related, logistical and regulatory barriers to both approaches. For one, there is complexity in diverting national interest (e.g. in the US) away from an epidemic that displays few signs of abating. There are also concerns regarding equitable distribution of CCP in LMICs and how that might be overcome. Further, the barriers to blood donation in general apply to collection of CCP; these obstacles are longstanding, accounting for the inability of many LMICs to meet their blood transfusion needs. Nonetheless, CCP affords dual opportunity for humanitarian outreach while tackling a broader challenge of blood transfusion safety and availability.","Bloch, Evan M.; Goel, Ruchika; Montemayor, Celina; Cohn, Claudia; Tobian, Aaron A.R.",Transfus Apher Sci,122,20

Random digit dialing recruited a population-representative sample of 3011 Hong Kong Chinese aged ≥ 15 years (mean = 44, 55% females) between February 25 and April 29 2020. Respondents reported social capital (perceived interpersonal trust, social harmony, and sense of belonging), income change since the outbreak (loss vs. gain/no change), depressive symptoms, preventive behaviors, and demographics. Controlling for sociodemographics, lack of perceived interpersonal trust was associated with probable depression and avoiding contact with people with respiratory symptoms. Lack of perceived sense of belonging was associated with probable depression and decreased odds of adopting preventive behaviors. Lack of perceived social harmony was associated with probable depression and increased odds of used face masks among respondents with income loss only. Our results suggest that social capital is related to lower risk of depression and to higher chance of used face masks particularly among those experiencing income loss related to COVID-19. Prevention of mental health problems and promotion of effective preventive behaviors could be implemented by focusing on support for those who are socioeconomically disadvantaged.","Li, Tsz Wai; Lee, Tatia Mei-chun; Goodwin, Robin; Ben-Ezra, Menachem; Liang, Li; Liu, Huinan; Hou, Wai Kai",Int J Environ Res Public Health,122,5

The purpose of this study is to share alternative COVID-19 case management based on the updated international knowledge. Methods: This study presents the main information about COVID-19 case management in Morocco from March to October 2020. The NVivo qualitative model content analysis was used to compare and prioritize health decisions with updated scientific evidence. Results: The lack of molecular diagnostic accuracy using the interpretation of cycles quantification values, was targeted only by allowing all private laboratories to do RT qPCR. However, there is an urgent need for standardisation with accurate molecular SARS-CoV-2 thermocyclers and kits that notify systematic cycles quantification and do more tests per days to control the spread effectively. A predictive tree of the cycle's range is presented following three steps: 1) the initial clinical definition, 2) the molecular confirmation, 3) and the diagnostic follows up results of the RT qPCR up to 28 days after the onset. At the same time, the seasonal vaccination against influenza and pneumonia could help to reduce COVID-19 deaths. Conclusions: Until an available SARS-CoV-2 specific vaccine and/or curative effective treatment, updated control strategy in Morocco and similar context countries require to target population living in highly COVID-19 epidemic cities or areas by mass testing with the right interpretation of PCR values changes, associated to seasonal vaccination to foster the immunity.","Bennis, I.",,122,7

The basic ideal refers to the possibility of thinking about vulnerability as deriving by the interactions of several risks that can affect the urban system and by the interactions among them. In this sense, it is possible to refer to an “integrated territorial risk”. Considering the city as a complex and dynamic system that while evolving produce entropy is the main theoretical reference supporting this study. The loss of energy during the evolution of the system corresponds to some conditions of inefficiency that involve the whole system and, as such, this lost energy can be assumed as a “systemic entropy”. Is it possible to measure the levels of this vulnerability of the urban system when it stays in ordinary conditions, namely not during stress states that modify the state of equilibrium of the system itself? It is possible to assess the production of this “internal entropy”? In order to answer to these questions in mind, this study aims at analyzing dyscrasias that can occur within the main components of the urban system in order to individuate possible strategies able both to mitigate the fragility of the urban system and to improve its resilience.","Fistola, R.; Gargiulo, C.; La Rocca, R.A.",Environ Impact Assess Rev,122,26

Here, we have devised a bioinformatic pipeline that inputs SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing in FASTA/FASTQ format and outputs a single Variant Calling Format file that can be processed to obtain variant annotations and perform downstream population genetic testing. As proof of concept, we have analyzed over 229,000 SARS-CoV-2 viral sequences up until November 30, 2020. We have identified over 39,000 variants worldwide with increased polymorphisms, spanning the ORF3a gene as well as the 3′ untranslated (UTR) regions, specifically in the conserved stem loop region of SARS-CoV-2 which is accumulating greater observed viral diversity relative to chance variation. Our analysis pipeline has also discovered the existence of SARS-CoV-2 hypermutation with low frequency (less than in 2% of genomes) likely arising through host immune responses and not due to sequencing errors. Among annotated non-sense variants with a population frequency over 1%, recurrent inactivation of the ORF8 gene was found. This was found to be present in the newly identified B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 lineage that originated in the United Kingdom. Almost all VOC-containing genomes possess one stop codon in ORF8 gene (Q27(∗)), however, 13% of these genomes also contains another stop codon (K68(∗)), suggesting that ORF8 loss does not interfere with SARS-CoV-2 spread and may play a role in its increased virulence.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, MIH has significant potential to mitigate concerns about COVID-19 infection from seeking urgent care in health care settings. The MIGHTy Heart (“Using Mobile Integrated Health and Telehealth to Support Transitions of Care among Heart Failure Patients”) study is a comparative effectiveness pragmatic trial comparing a transitions of care coordinator to MIH. Recruitment began in January 2021, 10 months into the pandemic. Existing challenges to patient engagement in research have become more pronounced during the pandemic;studies show that pre-COVID-19, less than 50% of trials met proposed timelines for recruitment, and early evidence suggests this number has dropped during the pandemic. Here we report on the challenges and solutions for recruiting patients in emergency medicine-focused programs during the COVID-19 pandemic in the first 5 months of recruitment. Methods: We convened a Stakeholder Engagement Board (SEB) including nurses, patients, community paramedics, and case managers. We conducted a descriptive, thematic synthesis of the SEB discussions to address the challenges. We implemented strategies for increased enrollment generated by the SEB two months into the MIGHTy Heart study and evaluated changes in the proportion of patients enrolled among those who were eligible for the study before and after implementation of these strategies. Results: We identified 4 significant COVID-related challenges to recruitment into the MIGHTY-Heart study. COVID-19 patients excluded from inpatient recruitment: 18% of screened patients (n=287) were COVID-19 positive while inpatient, and hospital policy prevented the team from approaching them in contact isolation. Limited family presence: the hospital visitor policy restricts visiting hours to 4 hours and 1 family member. Patients are more likely to participate if the decision is made with a family member. Due to COVID-19, patients are more reticent to allow any health care providers in their homes out of concern for possibly infecting other family members with COVID-19. Mandatory mask wearing in the hospital has posed barriers to communication, especially for some of the elderly patients, who may rely on visual and auditory cues for verbal communication. From the SEB, we identified 3 strategies to support patient engagement. Virtual recruitment: after discharge, patients who were COVID-19 positive were contacted by phone or email. Patients were emailed the informed consent and study materials and mailed gift cards. Family engagement: per patient request, the research assistants would call patient’s family members if they were not at the bedside at the time of recruitment to explain the study and answer any questions that family members might have. Study materials were left at the patient’s bedside for patients to read and share with family members in advance of deciding to enroll in the study. The proportion of eligible patients who enrolled in MIGHTy Heart increased from 28-32% before these strategies were implemented to 46-52% in the months after implementation (Figure 1). Conclusion: The novel solutions developed by the SEB and study team increased enrollment in the MIH program. These strategies may be useful for others facing challenges to recruitment in emergency medicine-related programs during the COVID-19 pandemic. [Formula presented]","Ellison, M.

METHODS: Four databases (CINAHL, MEDLINE, ProQuest, and Web of Science Core Collections) were searched in April 2020 using keywords relating to SARS-CoV, physical function, fitness, and exercise. Observational studies or randomised controlled trials were included if they involved people following SARS-CoV infection and either assessed the change or recovery in physical function/fitness or evaluated the effects exercise postinfection. RESULTS: 10 articles were included in this review. Evidence from nine articles demonstrated that SARS-CoV patients had reduced levels of physical function and fitness postinfection in comparison to healthy controls. Furthermore, patients demonstrated incomplete recovery of physical function, with some experiencing residual impairments 1 to 2 years postinfection. Evidence from one randomised controlled trial found that a combined aerobic and resistance training intervention significantly improved physical function and fitness postinfection in comparison to a control group. CONCLUSIONS: Physical function and fitness are impaired following SARS-CoV infection, and impairments may persist up to 1 to 2 years postinfection. Researchers and clinicians can use these findings to understand the potential impairments and rehabilitation needs of people recovering from the current COVID-19 outbreak. While one study demonstrated that exercise can improve physical function and fitness postinfection, further research is required to determine the effectiveness of exercise in people recovering from similar infections (eg, COVID-19). IMPACT STATEMENT: Considering the similarities in pathology and clinical presentation of SARS-CoV and COVID-19, it is likely that COVID-19 patients will present with similar impairments to physical function. Accordingly, research is required to measure the extent of functional impairments in COVID-19 cohorts. In addition, research should evaluate whether rehabilitation interventions such as exercise can promote postinfection recovery.","Rooney, Scott; Webster, Amy; Paul, Lorna",Phys Ther,122,2

It is evident from animal and imaging studies that subtle variations in the intrauterine environment can cause recognizable differences in brain structure and cognitive functions in the offspring. A wide variety of environmental factors may play a role in precipitating the emergent developmental dysregulation and the consequent evolution of psychiatric traits in early adulthood by inducing inflammatory, oxidative and nitrosative stress (IO&NS) pathways, mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis, and epigenetic dysregulation. However, the precise mechanisms behind such relationships and the specificity of the risk factors for schizophrenia remain exploratory. Considering the paucity of knowledge on fetal programming of schizophrenia, it is timely to consolidate the recent advances in the field and put forward an integrated overview of the mechanisms associated with fetal origin of schizophrenia.","Debnath, Monojit; Venkatasubramanian, Ganesan; Berk, Michael",Neurosci Biobehav Rev,122,1

Inter-relationships between sleep and mental health have not been examined using longitudinal objective sleep-wake data, during these abruptly imposed lifestyle changes. We examined objective sleep-wake data and surveyed mental health data collected among 4,912 U.S. adult users of a validated sleep wearable (WHOOP, Boston, Massachusetts) before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Comparing the pre-pandemic (January 1 to March 12, 2020) and acute pandemic-onset intervals (March 13 to April 12, 2020), participants exhibited increased mean sleep duration (0.25h [95% CI = 0.237-0.270]), later sleep onset (18m [17.378-20.045]) and offset (36m [35.111-38.106]), and increased consistency of sleep timing (3.51 [3.295-3.728] out of 100); all P < 0.0001. Generally, participants with persistent sleep deficiency and low sleep consistency had higher odds of symptoms of anxiety or depression, burnout, and new or increased substance use during the pandemic. Decreases in sleep duration (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.30, 95% CI = 1.03-1.65, P = 0.025) and sleep consistency (2.05 [1.17-3.67], P = 0.009) were associated with increased anxiety and depression symptoms during the pandemic.

Numerous pre-clinical studies are evaluating RNAi as a novel therapeutic modality in the battle against gain-of-function autosomal dominant diseases, cancer, and viral infections. One emerging concern is that RNAi mono-therapies might ultimately fail to control viruses that can escape silencing by mutation and/or RNAi suppression. Thus, sophisticated strategies are being developed that aim to avert viral resistance by combining RNAi effectors with each other or with further gene expression inhibitors. Several reports already validate this new concept of “combinatorial RNAi” (coRNAi) and illustrate its versatility by describing co-expression of RNAi triggers directed against single or multiple, viral or cellular, targets. Other studies document the successful delivery of these triggers with additional RNA- or protein-based silencers. Moreover, vectors have been engineered to blend RNAi-mediated gene inhibition with conventional gene replacement strategies. Collectively, these efforts open up exciting new therapeutic avenues but could also augment the inherent risks of RNAi technology, including immune responses, off-targeting, and oversaturation of endogenous pathways. Here, we critically review all coRNAi strategies and discuss the requirements for their transition into clinical application.","Grimm, Dirk; Kay, Mark A",Mol Ther,122,16

With the advent of novel biologics and small molecule inhibitors, it is important to critically evaluate the role of phototherapy in dermatology. Surveys have shown that many dermatology residency programs do not dedicate time to teach residents how to prescribe or administer phototherapy. Limitations of phototherapy include access to a center, time required for treatments, and insurance approval. Home phototherapy, a viable option, is also underutilized. However, it should be emphasized that modern phototherapy has been in use for over 40 years, has an excellent safety profile, and does not require laboratory monitoring. It can be safely combined with many other treatment modalities including biologics and small molecule inhibitors. In addition, phototherapy costs significantly less than these novel agents. Dermatologists are the only group of physicians who have the expertise and proper training to deliver this treatment modality to our patients. Therefore, in order to continue to deliver high quality, cost-effective care, it is imperative that phototherapy be maintained as an integral part of the dermatology treatment armamentarium.","Torres, Angeli Eloise E.; Lyons, Alexis B.; Hamzavi, Iltefat H.; Lim, Henry W.",J Am Acad Dermatol,122,3

The objective of this study was to determine knowledge, attitudes, and safety practices about COVID-19 among high school students in Iran. Methods: This study was conducted from March 24th-April 3rd, 2020. Data were collected via an online-parent-administrative questionnaire. Results: Responses of 704 students were analyzed. Students' mean (SD) knowledge score was 21.5 (4.6) of 30. More than 90% of students knew about the cause of the disease, the routes of transmission, and the most renowned symptoms: dyspnea and cough. Social-and- audiovisual-media were the leading information source. Most students believed that people need to keep safe physical distancing, everyone should isolate themselves upon symptoms onset, people should avoid unnecessary in-person contact with family and friends, and that cities need to go under lockdowns if needed. Students' mean (SD) practice score was 20.2 (2.5) of 24. Most students did not go on a trip, and more than 80% said they would wear facemasks when going outside. Conclusions: High school students' knowledge and safety practices about COVID-19 were somewhat satisfactory, and their attitudes toward the disease were mainly positive. Nevertheless, some witnessed knowledge gaps, negative attitudes, and unsafe practices in the study highlighted the need for targeted education on the pandemic.

Many of the COVID-19 patients develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and require ventilatory support based on their severity for which conventional strategies are being used along with few newer strategies. We conducted this multicenter survey to know the physician's current ventilation strategies adopted for the care of COVID-19 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The survey was conducted after taking the ethical committee clearance. The web-based multicenter, cross-sectional questionnaire study was sent to physicians, who were involved in the management of COVID-19 patients. The questionnaire was segregated into three parts: part one consisted of general information and consent form, part two was concerned regarding demographic characteristics, and part three was concerned about their practices and strategies for ventilation of COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: A total of 223 responders replied for the questionnaire; 190 participated in the study saying that they are involved in the management of COVID-19 patients. The answers to the questionnaires were expressed as a percentage of total responses. 86% of the respondents said they have a designated intensive care unit (ICU) and 89% of the responders said they have an intubation/extubation protocol for suspect/confirmed COVID-19 patients. The responses of junior residents (JRs), senior residents (SRs), assistant professors/junior consultants, and professors/consultants were analyzed separately, and a few significant differences were observed. 39% of JRs were aware of prone ventilation as the most effective rescue ventilation strategy compared to 69% of consultants/professors. Extracorporeal membranous oxygenation (ECMO) strategy was also more significant in consultants/professors (40%) vs JRs (12%). The responders were also diverged based on medical college and corporate hospitals, and their responses were noted. Most commonly, responders in the corporate hospitals had a facility to ventilate COVID-19 patients in a negative pressure isolation facility compared to a nonnegative pressure room isolation facility in medical colleges. CONCLUSION: Most of the responders were practicing ventilation strategies in a standard manner. JRs need to undergo further training in a few aspects of the ventilatory management, and also, they need to update themselves with newer treatment modalities as they keep evolving. Medical colleges are providing at par facility compared to corporate hospitals except for few advance care facilities. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: This study highlights the current practice of ventilatory management of COVID-19 patients, which is satisfactory. The survey can be used to develop study tools, to educate resident doctors, to further improve quality of care of critical COVID-19 patients.

To counter the spread of the virus, the Italian government has adopted an extensive lockdown, forcing citizens to stay at home and avoid social contact. The COVID-19 quarantine represents a unique phenomenon in the recent centuries, and its long-term consequences on people’s lives and mental health are still to be understood. This study aimed to explore significant experiences of people who did not contract the virus, yet experienced the quarantine as a potentially stressful condition. METHODS: Italians who did not contract the COVID-19 were invited to participate in semi-structured interviews employing the Critical Incident Technique. Interviews were designed to capture the significant experiences related to the lockdown period in Italy. Participants were asked to describe the most significant (1) negative and (2) positive critical events that they personally experienced during the ongoing quarantine. Such events were meant to provide information on their experience of the quarantine as a whole. The audio-taped interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed following Critical Incident Technique’s indications. RESULTS: Twenty two participants described a total of 43 critical events, including 22 negative episodes and 21 positive events experienced during the COVID-19 quarantine. Three categories emerged from the negative episodes and four categories emerged from the positive events described by the participants. Relevant themes both positive and negative concerned mostly relationships (with partners, family, and friends), and the alteration of everyday activities, Also a specific “sensation of emergency” that the participants felt during the pandemic emerged, as an emotionally-charged response to quarantine-related external stimuli. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge this is the first in-depth qualitative study investigating the significant negative and positive events that people experienced during the COVID-19 quarantine. Future research could employ analogous event recollection methods but focus on other populations (e.g., fragile subjects or on other national contests), in order to extend the information on the quarantine experience and its possible long-lasting effects.","Durosini, Ilaria; Triberti, Stefano; Savioni, Lucrezia; Pravettoni, Gabriella",PLoS One,122,9

METHODS: In this retrospective study, 85 patients with confirmed COVID‐19 were enrolled and divided into low and high MPR group. Data from repeated measures were compared by the generalized estimating equations. Cox regression analyses were performed to assess the impact of MPR on the incidence of severe pneumonia (SP), with inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) used to reduce confounding bias. The primary outcome is the incidence of SP of COVID‐19. RESULTS: During follow‐up, 17 (20.0%) patients were developed to SP. Compared with mild patients, patients with SP developed showed a higher MPR level at baseline, day 1, day 2, and day 3 after admission (P = .005, P = .015, P = .009, and P = .032, respectively). Kaplan‐Meier method showed a higher incidence of SP in the high MPR group than the low MPR group (log‐rank test = 10.66, P = .001). After adjustment, high MPR was associated with an elevated incidence of SP (HR, 5.841, 95% CI, 1.566‐21.791, P = .009). The IPTW method also suggested that MPR was a significant factor related to the incidence of SP (HR, 8.337, 95% CI, 4.045‐17.182, P < .001). CONCLUSION: High MPR level is an independent risk factor for severe pneumonia in patients with COVID‐19.","Zhong, Qingyang; Peng, Jie",J Clin Lab Anal,122,1

In contrast, heterologous polyclonal antibodies raised against S protein, through the recognition of multiple target epitopes, have the potential to maintain neutralization capacities. XAV-19 is a swine glyco-humanized polyclonal neutralizing antibody raised against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the Wuhan-Hu-1 Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. XAV-19 target epitopes were found distributed all over the RBD and particularly cover the receptor binding motives (RBM), in direct contact sites with the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE-2). Therefore, in Spike/ACE2 interaction assays, XAV-19 showed potent neutralization capacities of the original Wuhan Spike and of the United Kingdom (Alpha/B.1.1.7) and South African (Beta/B.1.351) variants. These results were confirmed by cytopathogenic assays using Vero E6 and live virus variants including the Brazil (Gamma/P.1) and the Indian (Delta/B.1.617.2) variants. In a selective pressure study with the Beta strain on Vero E6 cells conducted over 1 month, no mutation was associated with addition of increasing doses XAV-19. The potential to reduce viral load in lungs was confirmed in a human ACE2 transduced mouse model. XAV-19 is currently evaluated in patients hospitalized for COVID-19-induced moderate pneumonia in a phase 2a-2b (NCT04453384) where safety was already demonstrated and in an ongoing 2/3 trial (NCT04928430) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of XAV-19 in patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19.

To identify the best strategy to replace this full lock-down, sophisticated models that rely on mobility data have been developed. In this study, using the example of France as a case-study, we develop a simple model considering contacts between age classes to derive the general impact of partial lock-down strategies targeted at specific age groups. We found that epidemic suppression can only be achieved by targeting isolation of young and middle age groups with high efficiency. All other strategies tested result in a flatter epidemic curve, with outcomes in (e.g. mortality and health system over-capacity) dependent of the age groups targeted and the isolation efficiency. Targeting only the elderly can decrease the expected mortality burden, but in proportions lower than more integrative strategies involving several age groups. While not aiming to provide quantitative forecasts, our study shows the benefits and constraints of different partial lock-down strategies, which could help guide decision-making.","ROCHE, Benjamin; Garchitorena, Andres; Roiz, David",,122,24

Vaccination is the most effective method of preventing infection and controlling the spread of IBV, but currently available inactivated and attenuated virus vaccines have some disadvantages. We developed a chimeric virus-like particle (VLP)-based candidate vaccine for IBV protection. The chimeric VLP was composed of matrix 1 protein from avian influenza H5N1 virus and a fusion protein neuraminidase (NA)/spike 1 (S1) that was generated by fusing IBV S1 protein to the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of NA protein of avian influenza H5N1 virus. The chimeric VLPs elicited significantly higher S1-specific antibody responses in intramuscularly immunized mice and chickens than inactivated IBV viruses. Furthermore, the chimeric VLPs induced significantly higher neutralization antibody levels than inactivated H120 virus in SPF chickens. Finally, the chimeric VLPs induced significantly higher IL-4 production in mice. These results demonstrate that chimeric VLPs have the potential for use in vaccines against IBV infection.","Lv, Lishan; Li, Xiaoming; Liu, Genmei; Li, Ran; Liu, Qiliang; Shen, Huifang; Wang, Wei; Xue, Chunyi; Cao, Yongchang",J Vet Sci,122,24

We triangulated questionnaire data with interviews and text‐based website data. Of the 30 human milk bank services from which data were obtained, the majority faced substantial internal organization change in terms of staffing and protocols and experienced financial hardship in particular because of decreases in donor human milk orders. At the same time, most banks reported an increase in their numbers of donors and in the volume of milk collected. These results show that the pandemic significantly affected the way in which many North American milk banks operate, some lactating mothers donate their milk and, at least during the first few months of the crisis, certain hospitals' donor human milk ordering patterns changed. It suggests in particular that stay‐at‐home orders and the turn to remote work created the potential for a surge in human milk available for donation as a number of parents no longer needed their surplus for their own children. Legal and policy reform should focus on replicating the positive effects of the pandemic on breastfeeding by guaranteeing paid parental leave and flexible work conditions. Initiatives should also aim at counteracting its negative effects by mandating the insurance coverage of donor human milk, supporting milk banks financially and, more generally, integrating lactation and human milk banking services within the health system.","Cohen, Mathilde; Cassidy, Tanya",Matern Child Nutr,122,32

In the UK, it has led to sharp falls in labour demand in many sectors of the economy and to initial acute labour shortages in other sectors. Much more than in a typical downturn, the current crisis is not simply a general slowdown in economic activity but also a radical short‐term shift in the mix of economic activities – of which an unknown, but possibly significant, amount will be persistent. The initial policy response has focused on cushioning the blow to families’ finances and allowing the majority of workers and firms to resume their original activities once the crisis subsides. These are crucial priorities. But there should also be a focus on reallocating some workers, either temporarily if working in shut‐down sectors or permanently by facilitating transitions to sectors and jobs offering better prospects and facing labour shortages. The phasing‐out of the furlough subsidies, which is projected to happen in Autumn 2020, brings this into even sharper focus since the alternative for many workers will be unemployment.

Projecting the size of an unmitigated epidemic and the potential effect of different control measures has been critical to support evidence-based policymaking during the early stages of the epidemic. Methods We used a stochastic age-structured transmission model to explore a range of intervention scenarios, including the introduction of school closures, social distancing, shielding of elderly groups, self-isolation of symptomatic cases, and extreme ""lockdown""-type restrictions. We simulated different durations of interventions and triggers for introduction, as well as combinations of interventions. For each scenario, we projected estimated new cases over time, patients requiring inpatient and critical care (intensive care unit, ICU) treatment, and deaths. Findings We found that mitigation measures aimed at reducing transmission would likely have decreased the reproduction number, but not sufficiently to prevent ICU demand from exceeding NHS availability. To keep ICU bed demand below capacity in the model, more extreme restrictions were necessary. In a scenario where ""lockdown""-type interventions were put in place to reduce transmission, these interventions would need to be in place for a large proportion of the coming year in order to prevent healthcare demand exceeding availability. Interpretation The characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 mean that extreme measures are likely required to bring the epidemic under control and to prevent very large numbers of deaths and an excess of demand on hospital beds, especially those in ICUs.","Davies, Nicholas G; Kucharski, Adam J; Eggo, Rosalind M; Gimma, Amy; Edmunds, W.

Data were collected during January 2021, when Israel was in lockdown, from a convenience sample of 381 Jewish Israelis (M = 55.39, SD = 17.17). Participants completed questionnaires examining demographics, SNtD, death anxiety and COVID‐19 vaccination anxiety. A hierarchical regression analysis examined the connections between these variables and COVID‐19 vaccination anxiety while controlling for demographics and for receiving COVID‐19 vaccinations. In line with the hypotheses, SNtD and death anxiety were each positively associated with COVID‐19 vaccination anxiety, and death anxiety levels moderated the positive connection between SNtD and COVID‐19 vaccination anxiety, as this association was not significant for individuals with low death anxiety. The findings of this study provide preliminary evidence concerning the role of death anxiety in moderating the effect that SNtD has on COVID‐19 vaccination anxiety. These findings are in line with the TMT and justify further investigation and may be utilized in future research in order to address COVID‐19 vaccination anxiety more effectively.","Bodner, Ehud; Bergman, Yoav S.; Ben‐David, Boaz; Palgi, Yuval",Stress Health,122,18

We herein introduce a continuum model for elaborating on the rheological implications of adding particles in blood. The model is developed using non-equilibrium thermodynamics to guarantee thermodynamic admissibility. Red blood cells are modeled as deformed droplets with a constant volume that are able to aggregate, whereas particles are considered rigid spheroids. The model predictions are compared favorably against rheological data for both spherical and non-spherical particles immersed in non-aggregating blood. It is expected that the use of this model will allow for the testing of DCPs in virtual patients and for their tailor-design in treating various diseases.

There have been concerns that care deferral may have negative health effects, but it is hoped that telemedicine can provide a viable alternative. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to understand what type of health care services were being deferred during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, the role played by telemedicine to fill in care gaps, and changes in attitudes toward telemedicine. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of survey responses from 1694 primary care patients in a mid-sized northeastern city. Our main outcomes were use of telemedicine and reports of care deferral during the shutdown. RESULTS: Deferred care was widespread—48% (n=812) of respondents deferred care—but it was largely for preventive services, particularly dental and primary care, and did not cause concerns about negative health effects. In total, 30.2% (n=242) of those who delayed care were concerned about health effects, with needs centered around orthopedics and surgery. Telemedicine was viewed more positively than prior to the pandemic; it was seen as a viable option to deliver deferred care, particularly by respondents who were over 65 years of age, female, and college educated. Mental health services stood out for having high levels of deferred care. CONCLUSIONS: Temporary health system shutdowns will give rise to deferred care. However, much of the deferrals will be for preventive services. The effect of this on patient health can be moderated by prioritizing surgical and orthopedic services and delivering other services through telemedicine. Having telemedicine as an option is particularly crucial for mental health services.","Atherly, Adam; Van Den Broek-Altenburg, Eline; Hart, Victoria; Gleason, Kelsey; Carney, Jan",JMIR Public Health Surveill,122,16

Our laboratory performed a series of virology and serology tests for SARS patients admitted to our hospital. Cross‐reactivity was found when testing for antibody against human T‐cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) in one patient with SARS. Therefore, antibodies against HTLV were examined in paired‐sera from 26 SARS patients. ELISA and a neutralization test were used to measure anti‐SARS antibodies. Seroconversion for antibody against SARS‐CoV was observed in all patients. Surprisingly, with the use of ELISA for HTLV, sera for 13 patients were positive for HTLV (50%), and seroconversion for HTLV was also observed in 10 patients (38.5%). Western blot for HTLV on those 26 paired‐sera from 13 HTLV‐positive patients displayed 5 positive results for HTLV‐I, 7 positive results for HTLV‐II, 1 positive result for both HTLV‐I and II, 9 negative results for either HTLV‐I or HTLV‐II, and 4 “indeterminate” results. The findings that antibody to HTLV can be detected in blood samples collected from SARS patients provide important information for safe handling of blood products.

The aim was to determine feasibility and preliminary effect of a 12-week intervention consisting of anabolic steroid in addition to physiotherapy and nutritional supplement on knee-extension strength and function after hip fracture surgery. METHODS: Patients were randomized (1:1) during acute care to: 1. Anabolic steroid (Nandrolone Decanoate) or 2. Placebo (Saline). Both groups received identical physiotherapy (with strength training) and a nutritional supplement. Primary outcome was change in maximal isometric knee-extension strength from the week after surgery to 14weeks. Secondary outcomes were physical performance, patient reported outcomes and body composition. RESULTS: Seven hundred seventeen patients were screened, and 23 randomised (mean age 73.4years, 78% women). Target sample size was 48. Main limitations for inclusion were not home-dwelling (18%) and cognitive dysfunction (16%). Among eligible patients, the main reason for declining participation was Overwhelmed and stressed by situation (37%). Adherence to interventions was: Anabolic steroid 87%, exercise 91% and nutrition 61%. Addition of anabolic steroid showed a non-significant between-group difference in knee-extension strength in the fractured leg of 0.11 (95%CI -0.25;0.48) Nm/kg in favor of the anabolic group. Correspondingly, a non-significant between-group difference of 0.16 (95%CI -0.05;0.36) Nm/Kg was seen for the non-fractured leg. No significant between-group differences were identified for the secondary outcomes. Eighteen adverse reactions were identified (anabolic=10, control=8). CONCLUSIONS: Early inclusion after hip fracture surgery to this trial seemed non-feasible, primarily due to slow recruitment.

The aim of this study is to test the relationship between religious coping and health anxiety in Pakistani Muslims. The online survey method was used to collect data from 408 respondents. Structural equational modeling was performed, with results indicating that people who are suffering with health anxiety opt for religious coping (β = .54, R(2) = .29, p < .001). We conclude that it is important to consider the role of religion and spirituality during pandemic-induced anxiety. There are implications for counselors, physicians and researchers to integrate religious coping methods when planning mental health interventions during pandemics and otherwise.","Mahmood, Qaisar Khalid; Jafree, Sara Rizvi; Sohail, Malik Muhammad; Akram, Muhammad Babar",J Relig Health,122,21

While these measures are imperative to abate the spreading of COVID-19, the impact of these restrictions on health behaviours and lifestyles at home is undefined. Therefore, an international online survey was launched in April 2020, in seven languages, to elucidate the behavioural and lifestyle consequences of COVID-19 restrictions. This report presents the results from the first thousand responders on physical activity (PA) and nutrition behaviours. Methods: Following a structured review of the literature, the “Effects of home Confinement on multiple Lifestyle Behaviours during the COVID-19 outbreak (ECLB-COVID19)” Electronic survey was designed by a steering group of multidisciplinary scientists and academics. The survey was uploaded and shared on the Google online survey platform. Thirty-five research organisations from Europe, North-Africa, Western Asia and the Americas promoted the survey in English, German, French, Arabic, Spanish, Portuguese and Slovenian languages. Questions were presented in a differential format, with questions related to responses “before” and “during” confinement conditions. Results: 1047 replies (54% women) from Asia (36%), Africa (40%), Europe (21%) and other (3%) were included in the analysis. The COVID-19 home confinement had a negative effect on all PA intensity levels (vigorous, moderate, walking and overall). Additionally, daily sitting time increased from 5 to 8 h per day. Food consumption and meal patterns (the type of food, eating out of control, snacks between meals, number of main meals) were more unhealthy during confinement, with only alcohol binge drinking decreasing significantly. Conclusion: While isolation is a necessary measure to protect public health, results indicate that it alters physical activity and eating behaviours in a health compromising direction. A more detailed analysis of survey data will allow for a segregation of these responses in different age groups, countries and other subgroups, which will help develop interventions to mitigate the negative lifestyle behaviours that have manifested during the COVID-19 confinement.","Ammar, Achraf; Brach, Michael; Trabelsi, Khaled; Chtourou, Hamdi; Boukhris, Omar; Masmoudi, Liwa; Bouaziz, Bassem; Bentlage, Ellen; How, Daniella; Ahmed, Mona; Müller, Patrick; Müller, Notger; Aloui, Asma; Hammouda, Omar; Paineiras-Domingos, Laisa Liane; Braakman-Jansen, Annemarie; Wrede, Christian; Bastoni, Sofia; Pernambuco, Carlos Soares; Mataruna, Leonardo; Taheri, Morteza; Irandoust, Khadijeh; Khacharem, Aïmen; Bragazzi, Nicola L.; Chamari, Karim; Glenn, Jordan M.; Bott, Nicholas T.; Gargouri, Faiez; Chaari, Lotfi; Batatia, Hadj; Ali, Gamal Mohamed; Abdelkarim, Osama; Jarraya, Mohamed; El Abed, Kais; Souissi, Nizar; Van Gemert-Pijnen, Lisette; Riemann, Bryan L.; Riemann, Laurel; Moalla, Wassim; Gómez-Raja, Jonathan; Epstein, Monique; Sanderman, Robbert; Schulz, Sebastian V.

As an effort towards developing possible therapeutics for COVID-19, we have used machine-learning algorithms for the generation of alignment kernels from diverse viral sequences of Covid-19 reported from India, China, Italy and USA. Using these diverse sequences we have identified the conserved motifs and subsequently a peptide library was designed against them. Of these, 4 peptides have shown strong binding affinity against the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 (M(pro)) and also maintained their stability and specificity under physiological conditions as observed through MD Simulations.

This implies our Galaxy contains PeV accelerators (PeVatrons), but all proposed models of Galactic cosmic-ray accelerators encounter non-trivial difficulties at exactly these energies. Tens of Galactic accelerators capable of accelerating particle to tens of TeV (1 TeV =$10^\mathbf{12}$ electron volts) energies were inferred from recent gamma-ray observations. None of the currently known accelerators, however, not even the handful of shell-type supernova remnants commonly believed to supply most Galactic cosmic rays, have shown the characteristic tracers of PeV particles: power-law spectra of gamma rays extending without a cutoff or a spectral break to tens of TeV. Here we report deep gamma-ray observations with arcminute angular resolution of the Galactic Centre regions, which show the expected tracer of the presence of PeV particles within the central 10~parsec of the Galaxy. We argue that the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A* is linked to this PeVatron. Sagittarius A* went through active phases in the past, as demonstrated by X-ray outbursts and an outflow from the Galactic Centre. Although its current rate of particle acceleration is not sufficient to provide a substantial contribution to Galactic cosmic rays, Sagittarius A* could have plausibly been more active over the last $\gtrsim 10^{6-7}$ years, and therefore should be considered as a viable alternative to supernova remnants as a source of PeV Galactic cosmic rays.","Abramowski, H.E.S.S. collaboration A.; Aharonian, F.; Benkhali, F.

Objective: (1) Identify factors predicting intensive care unit (ICU) transfer and (2) develop a simple calculator for clinicians managing patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Methods: A total of 2,685 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to a large metropolitan health system in Georgia, USA between March and July 2020 were included in the study. Seventy-five percent of patients were included in the training dataset (admitted March 1 to July 10). Through multivariable logistic regression, we developed a prediction model (probability score) for ICU transfer. Then, we validated the model by estimating its performance accuracy (area under the curve [AUC]) using data from the remaining 25% of patients (admitted July 11 to July 31). Results: We included 2,014 and 671 patients in the training and validation datasets, respectively. Diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, serum C-reactive protein, and serum lactate dehydrogenase were identified as significant risk factors for ICU transfer, and a prediction model was developed.

To date, the disease has infected more than 18 million people with over 690k deaths reported. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the current gold standard for clinical diagnosis but may produce false positives; thus, chest CT based diagnosis is considered more viable. However, accurate screening is challenging due to difficulty in annotation efforts of infected areas, curation of large datasets, and the slight discrepancies between COVID-19 and other viral pneumonia. In this study, we propose an attention-based end-to-end weakly supervised framework for the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 and bacterial pneumonia based on multiple instance learning (MIL). We further incorporate unsupervised contrastive learning for improved accuracy with attention applied both in spatial and latent contexts, herein we propose Dual Attention Contrastive based MIL (DA-CMIL). DA-CMIL takes as input a several patient CT slices (considered as a bag of instances) and outputs a single label. Attention based pooling is applied to implicitly select key slices in latent space, and spatial attention learns slice spatial context for interpretable diagnosis. A contrastive loss is applied at the instance level to encode similarity in features from the same patient against pooled patient features. Empirical results show our algorithm achieves an overall accuracy of 98.6% and an AUC of 98.4%. Moreover, ablation studies show the benefit of contrastive learning with MIL.","Chikontwe, P.; Luna, M.; Kang, M.; Hong, K. S.; Ahn, J. H.; Park, S. H.",,122,22

Early and rapid detection is crucial to control of the SARS-CoV-2 transmission. While representing the gold standard for early diagnosis, nucleic acid tests for SARS-CoV-2 are often complicated and time-consuming. Serological rapid antibody tests are characterized by high rates of false-negative diagnoses, especially during early infection. Here, we developed a novel nanozyme-based chemiluminescence paper assay for rapid and sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen, which integrates nanozyme and enzymatic chemiluminescence immunoassay with the lateral flow strip. The core of our paper test is a robust Co–Fe@hemin-peroxidase nanozyme that catalyzes chemiluminescence comparable with natural peroxidase HRP and amplifies immune reaction signal. The detection limit for spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 was 0.1 ng/mL, with a linear range of 0.2-100 ng/mL. Moreover, the sensitivity of test for pseudovirus could reach 360 TCID(50)/mL, which was comparable with ELISA method. The strip recognized SARS-CoV-2 antigen specifically, and there was no cross reaction with other coronaviruses or influenza A subtypes. This testing can be completed within 16 min, much shorter compared to the usual 1-2 h required for currently used nucleic acid tests. Furthermore, signal detection is feasible using the camera of a standard smartphone. Ingredients for nanozyme synthesis are simple and readily available, considerably lowering the overall cost. In conclusion, our paper test provides a high-sensitive point-of-care testing (POCT) approach for SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection, which should greatly facilitate early detection of SARS-CoV-2 infections, and considerably lower the financial burden on national healthcare resources.","Liu, Dan; Ju, Chenhui; Han, Chao; Shi, Rui; Chen, Xuehui; Duan, Demin; Yan, Jinghua; Yan, Xiyun",Biosens Bioelectron,122,19

To this end, physiologically-relevant mathematical modeling can provide a robust in silico tool to understand COVID-19 pathophysiology and the in vivo dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. Guided by ACE2-tropism (ACE2 receptor dependency for infection) of the virus, and by incorporating cellular-scale viral dynamics and innate and adaptive immune responses, we have developed a multiscale mechanistic model for simulating the time-dependent evolution of viral load distribution in susceptible organs of the body (respiratory tract, gut, liver, spleen, heart, kidneys, and brain). Following calibration with in vivo and clinical data, we used the model to simulate viral load progression in a virtual patient with varying degrees of compromised immune status. Further, we conducted global sensitivity analysis of model parameters and ranked them for their significance in governing clearance of viral load to understand the effects of physiological factors and underlying conditions on viral load dynamics. Antiviral drug therapy, interferon therapy, and their combination was simulated to study the effects on viral load kinetics of SARS-CoV-2.

Modern hospitals in high-income countries have mechanical systems of building ventilation also called HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning) but installation and maintenance of such systems is a challenging and resource-intensive task. Even when the state-of-the-art technology was used to build airborne infection isolation rooms (AIIRs), recommended standards were often not met in field studies. The current coronavirus disease-2019 pandemic has highlighted the need to find cost-effective and less resource-intensive engineering solutions. Moreover, there is a need for the involvement of interdisciplinary teams to find innovative infection control solutions and doctors are frequently lacking in their understanding of building ventilation-related problems as well as their possible solutions. The current article describes building ventilation strategies (natural ventilation and hybrid ventilation) for hospitals where HVAC systems are either lacking or do not meet the recommended standards. Other measures like the use of portable air cleaning technologies and temporary negative-pressure rooms can be used as supplementary strategies in situations of demand surge. It can be easily understood that thermal comfort is compromised in buildings that are not mechanically fitted with HVAC systems, therefore the given building ventilation strategies are more helpful when climatic conditions are moderate or other measures are combined to maintain thermal comfort.

How to best obtain input in different risk scenarios is uncertain. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to investigate whether the International Risk Governance Council (IRGC) Framework is applicable to pharmacovigilance and can guide selecting engagement mechanisms for optimising stakeholder input. METHODS: For proof-of-concept, classify ‘iconic’ cases of pharmacovigilance engagement at the European Medicines Agency (EMA) by IRGC risk scenario types and compare the engagement that happened with the engagement discourse recommended by the IRGC Framework for different risk scenarios. If the concept is proven, derive proposals for strengthening engagement. RESULTS: Six iconic cases were classified by risk scenario type at the respective time points when deciding on engagement: venous thromboembolism with combined hormonal contraceptives (complex risk); lipodystrophy with highly active antiretroviral therapy medicines, carcinogenicity with contaminated nelfinavir products (uncertain risks); teratogenicity with thalidomide, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy with natalizumab, teratogenicity and developmental disorders with valproate (ambiguous risks). The comparison of the engagement events with IRGC recommendations showed correspondence between the scope/outcomes of the events and the features of the recommended discourse. CONCLUSIONS: The IRGC Framework appears applicable to pharmacovigilance. Proposals derived from the IRGC recommendations may be valuable for guiding regulators when selecting mechanisms for engagement with patients and healthcare professionals in given risk scenarios. The proposed decision guide aims at ensuring systematic and consistent engagement across regulatory assessments and providing for the most purposeful discourse, to effectively obtain real-world input for regulatory risk assessment, evaluation of risk minimisation measures and decision making.","Bahri, Priya; Pariente, Antoine",Drug Saf,122,22

For these reasons, hemp can be a new protagonist of Italian agriculture already oriented towards the objectives of EU 2030 which predicts 40% decrease in greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1990. The hemp cultivation can activate a new supply chain by allowing using different parts of the plant, benefiting farmers, environment, and human health. Indeed, although a very old plant, hemp will be one of the main protagonists of the green economy in the near future. Its seeds can be used by agri-food industry to produce flour, pasta, pastry and oil, while the stem through canapulo (woody part of stem) in green building sector. Its fiber (external part of stem) will find new applications in textile industry. As for its inflorescences and roots, thanks to the extraction of bioactive molecules, they will play an important role in the pharmaceutical and parapharmaceutical industry. Finally, only the medical sector with Δ(9)‐tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) extraction from inflorescence is not yet regulated by the aforementioned Italian Law.","Sorrentino, Giuseppe",Rend Lincei Sci Fis Nat,122,29

PCI is rare with an estimated incidence of 0.03 to 0–2% in general population. PCI can be distinguished into idiopathic (15%) or secondary (85%) and the clinical picture ranges from completely asymptomatic to life-threatening intraabdominal complications. Although etiology of PCI appears to be multifactorial, the exact pathophysiology is poorly understood and two main theories have been proposed (mechanical and bacterial). Over the last decades, an enormous therapeutic armamentarium was considered in PCI's management, including hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT). Treatment comprises conservative treatment in mild cases to surgery in highly symptomatic and complicated PCI. In the late 70s, HBOT started to be used in selected cases of PCI not responding to conservative measures. Since then, several case reports, case series, and reviews have been published in the literature with variable outcomes. The overall response rate and complete response were 92.1% (n = 82/89) and 65.2% (n = 58/89), respectively, with a median follow-up of 7 months. Furthermore, HBOT is extremely safe, with few reported complications in the literature when used for PCI. Nevertheless, a randomized, controlled, and double-blind clinical trial is unlikely to occur given the rarity of PCI, logistical issues of HBOT, and methodological considerations related to adequate blinding with a sham-controlled group. HBOT in combination with personalized diet and antibiotics may be beneficial for moderate to severe PCI in patients with no indication for emergency exploratory laparotomy. The purpose of this article is to synthesize the existing data, analyse results of previous studies, identify gaps in knowledge, and discuss PCI' management, including the proposal of an algorithm, with a special focus on HBOT.","Alpuim Costa, Diogo; Modas Daniel, Pedro; Vieira Branco, João",Front Med (Lausanne),122,20

The objective of this study was to systematically review the literature to scope and assess the effects of specific strategies for the management of the bodies. METHODS: We searched five general, three Chinese and four coronavirus disease (COVID-19)–specific electronic databases. We searched registries of clinical trials, websites of governmental and other relevant organisations, reference lists of the included papers and relevant systematic reviews, and Epistemonikos for relevant systematic reviews. We included guidance documents providing practical advice on the handling of bodies of deceased persons with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Then, we sought primary evidence of any study design reporting on the efficacy and safety of the identified strategies in coronaviruses. We included evidence relevant to contextual factors (ie, acceptability). A single reviewer extracted data using a pilot-tested form and graded the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. A second reviewer verified the data and assessments. RESULTS: We identified one study proposing an uncommon strategy for autopsies for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome. The study provided very low-certainty evidence that it reduced the risk of transmission. We identified 23 guidance documents providing practical advice on the steps of handling the bodies: preparation, packing, and others and advice related to both the handling of the dead bodies and the use of personal protective equipment by individuals handling them. We did not identify COVID-19 evidence relevant to any of these steps. CONCLUSION: While a substantive number of guidance documents propose specific strategies, we identified no study providing direct evidence for the effects of any of those strategies. While this review highlights major research gaps, it allows interested entities to build their own guidance.","Yaacoub, Sally; Schünemann, Holger J; Khabsa, Joanne; El-Harakeh, Amena; Khamis, Assem M; Chamseddine, Fatimah; El Khoury, Rayane; Saad, Zahra; Hneiny, Layal; Cuello Garcia, Carlos; Muti-Schünemann, Giovanna Elsa Ute; Bognanni, Antonio; Chen, Chen; Chen, Guang; Zhang, Yuan; Zhao, Hong; Abi Hanna, Pierre; Loeb, Mark; Piggott, Thomas; Reinap, Marge; Rizk, Nesrine; Stalteri, Rosa; Duda, Stephanie; Solo, Karla; Chu, Derek K; Akl, Elie A",BMJ Glob Health,122,22

Notre objectif était de déterminer la valeur prédictive positive (VVP) et la spécificité (Sp) de l’anosmie et de décrire sa prévalence et ses caractéristiques chez les patients COVID-19. Matériels et méthodes Il s’agissait d’une étude prospective observationnelle longitudinale d’une cohorte multicentrique des patients consultants entre le 17 et le 24 mars 2020, pour anosmie depuis moins de 9jours sans autres signes typiques d’infection à COVID-19. Les patients considérés comme COVID-19 positifs sont ceux ayant eu une RT-PCR COVID-19 positive sur les sécrétions nasopharyngées, ou ayant un contact documenté avec un patient COVID-19 positif. Sur 1824 patients, nous avons comparé la performance diagnostique de l’anosmie par rapport à celle des patients présentant une toux ou des céphalées. Comme pour l’anosmie, nous n’avons incus dans cette comparaison que les patients présentant des symptômes depuis moins de 9jours. Résultats Parmi les 55 patients ayant consulté pour anosmie, 51 (IC92,7 % [82,4–97,9]) avait une RT-PCR positive. La charge virale était modérée pour les 51 patients avec un taux médian de CT à 28,83 (27,55–32,72). L’âge moyen des 55 patients était 35,7±9,7 ans ; 56,4 % étaient des femmes. Dix-neuf patients (34,5 %) avaient des antécédents de rhinite allergique et 12 (21,8 %) étaient des fumeurs actifs. Aucun patient avait des antécédents de trouble de l’olfaction chronique. Une anosmie totale a été rapportée pour 47/55 patients (85,5 %) et une hyposmie pour 8 patients (14,5 %). L’anosmie était d’installation brutale dans 88,7 % des cas (n =47/55) et associée à une dysgueusie dans 80 % des cas (n =44/55). Une obstruction nasale était retrouvée chez seulement 2 patients. Les autres symptômes les plus fréquemment retrouvés étaient les céphalées (n =37, 68,5 %), l’asthénie (n =28, 57,1 %) et la toux (n =22, 40,7 %). L’anosmie était inaugurale chez 16 patients (29,1 %). Pour les autres patients, elle a commencé 3 (2–4) jours après le début de l’infection. Aucun de nos patients a eu une évolution vers une forme grave. À j15, la majorité des patients (72,9 %) ont partiellement récupéré l’odorat. L’analyse effectuée sur 1824 avait démontré que la VVP (77,8 % [73,8–81,6]) de l’anosmie et sa Sp (90,2 %, [88,2–92,0]) étaient plus élevées que celles de la toux (VVP : 47,3 % [45,0–49,5], Sp : 34,3 % [32,2–36,4]) ou les céphalées (VVP : 47,9 % [45,7–50,1], Sp : 36,7 % [34,5–38,8]). Conclusion L’anosmie paraît un symptôme spécifique et a une VVP élevée par rapport aux autres symptômes classiques de l’infection COVID. Elle est dans la majorité des cas d’installation brutale, sans obstruction nasale, souvent associée à une dysgueusie, et d’évolution a priori favorable.","Slama, D.; Bartier, S.; Hautefort, C.; Bequignon, E.; Etienne, N.; Pietri, M.

To address the myriad issues generated by this pandemic, an interdisciplinary breadth of research, clinical and public health communities has rapidly engaged to collectively find answers and solutions. One area of active inquiry is understanding the mode(s) of SARS‐CoV‐2 transmission. Although respiratory droplets are a known mechanism of transmission, other mechanisms are likely. Of particular importance to global health is the possibility of vertical transmission from infected mothers to infants through breastfeeding or consumption of human milk. However, there is limited published literature related to vertical transmission of any human coronaviruses (including SARS‐CoV‐2) via human milk and/or breastfeeding. Results of the literature search reported here (finalized on 17 April 2020) revealed a single study providing some evidence of vertical transmission of human coronavirus 229E; a single study evaluating presence of SARS‐CoV in human milk (it was negative); and no published data on MERS‐CoV and human milk. We identified 13 studies reporting human milk tested for SARS‐CoV‐2; one study (a non‐peer‐reviewed preprint) detected the virus in one milk sample, and another study detected SARS‐CoV‐2 specific IgG in milk. Importantly, none of the studies on coronaviruses and human milk report validation of their collection and analytical methods for use in human milk. These reports are evaluated here, and their implications related to the possibility of vertical transmission of coronaviruses (in particular, SARS‐CoV‐2) during breastfeeding are discussed.","Lackey, Kimberly A.; Pace, Ryan M.; Williams, Janet E.; Bode, Lars; Donovan, Sharon M.; Järvinen, Kirsi M.; Seppo, Antti E.; Raiten, Daniel J.; Meehan, Courtney L.; McGuire, Mark A.; McGuire, Michelle K.",Matern Child Nutr,122,20

Yield from blood culture is low, but lung aspirate culture provides a higher diagnostic yield. We aimed to determine if diagnostic yield could be increased further by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae b) and viruses in lung aspirate fluid. METHODS: A total of 95 children with radiological focal, lobar or segmental consolidation had lung aspirate performed and sent for bacterial culture and for PCR for detection of bacteria, viruses and Pneumocystis jirovecii. In children with a pneumococcal aetiology, pneumococcal bacterial loads were calculated in blood and lung aspirate fluid. RESULTS: Blood culture identified a bacterial pathogen in only 8 patients (8%). With the addition of PCR on lung aspirate samples, causative pathogens (bacterial, viral, pneumocystis) were identified singly or as co-infections in 59 children (62%). The commonest bacterial organism was S.pneumoniae (41%), followed by H. influenzae b (6%), and the commonest virus identified was adenovirus (16%), followed by human bocavirus (HBoV) (4%), either as single or co-infection. CONCLUSIONS: In a select group of African children, lung aspirate PCR significantly improves diagnostic yield. Our study confirms a major role of S.pneumoniae and viruses in the aetiology of childhood pneumonia in Africa.","Carrol, Enitan D.; Mankhambo, Limangeni A.; Guiver, Malcolm; Banda, Daniel L.; Denis, Brigitte; Dove, Winifred; Jeffers, Graham; Molyneux, Elizabeth M.; Molyneux, Malcolm E.; Hart, C.

However, these tests are often difficult to implement in a resource limited setting because of high cost. In this study, we developed and validated a method for simultaneous testing of common respiratory pathogens (Respanel) by real-time PCR in a convenient, strip-tube array format. Primers and probes for sixteen PCR assays were selected from the literature or newly designed. Following optimization of individual PCR assays, strip-tube arrays were prepared by dispensing primer-probe mixes (PPM) into two sets of 8-tube strips. Nucleic acid extracts from specimens were mixed with PCR master mix, and dispensed column-wise into 2 × 8-wells of a 96-well plate. PPMs from strip-tubes were then added to the wells using a multichannel pipette for real-time PCR. Individual PCR assays were optimized using previously known specimens (n = 394) with 91%–100% concordance with culture, DFA or PCR results. Respanel was then tested in a routine manner at two different sites using specimens (n = 147) previously tested by Qiagen Resplex I&II or Fast-Track Diagnostics Respiratory Pathogens 21 assays. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of Respanel were 94%, 95% and 95%, respectively, against Resplex and 88%, 100% and 99%, respectively, against FTDRP21. Respanel detected more pathogens (p < 0.05) than Resplex but the rate of pathogen detection was not significantly different from FTDRP21. Respanel is a convenient and inexpensive assay that is more sensitive than Resplex and comparable to FTDRP21 for the detection of common respiratory pathogens.","Hasan, Mohammad Rubayet; Al Mana, Hassan; Young, Virginia; Tang, Patrick; Thomas, Eva; Tan, Rusung; Tilley, Peter",J Virol Methods,122,1

This study explored organizational change processes and perceived facilitators and barriers relevant to implementing a health promotion initiative within gymnastics settings in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. A multiple-case design investigated the experiences of the state association (Gymnastics NSW) and five clubs from one region of NSW in a participatory Health-Promoting Gymnastics Clubs (HPGC) program. The program aimed to build the capacity of Gymnastics NSW to support affiliated clubs to become health-promoting settings. Interviews with organizational representatives explored their experiences of the program and identified factors that enabled or inhibited program adoption, implementation and sustainability. Facilitators and barriers identified included leadership and champions; organizational capacity and culture; priorities and timing; and characteristics of the HPGC framework. This multi-level, organizational change intervention demonstrated potential to create health-promoting gymnastics settings. Tailoring strategies in diverse club contexts required involvement of organizational leaders in program development and action planning. Despite positive impacts, pre-existing organizational culture inhibited integration of health promotion as a core value.

Our objectives were to determine the impact of SBM level on apparent total tract (ATTD) and ileal (AID) digestibility during PRRSV infection and to determine ileal basal endogenous losses (BEL) during PRRSV infection. Forty PRRSV negative gilts were fitted with a T-cannula in the distal ileum. Treatments were arranged in a 2 × 2 factorial with high and low SBM (HSBM, 29% vs. LSBM, 10%), with and without PRRSV (n = 6/treatment). The remaining pigs (n = 8/challenge status) were fed a N-free diet. Chromic oxide was used as an indigestible marker. On day post inoculation (dpi) 0, at 47.7 ± 0.57 kg BW, 20 pigs were inoculated with live PRRSV; 20 control pigs were sham inoculated. Infection was confirmed by serum PCR. Feces were collected at dpi 5 to 6 and dpi 16 to 17, and ileal digesta collected at dpi 7 to 8 and dpi 18 to 19. Feed, feces, and digesta were analyzed for DM, N, and GE. Digesta and feed were analyzed for AA. Data were analyzed in a 2 × 2 + 2 factorial design to determine main effects of diet and PRRSV and their interaction. Data from N-free fed pigs were analyzed separately to determine BEL and hindgut disappearance due to PRRSV infection. All control pigs remained PRRSV negative. There were no interactions for AID of AA; however, HSBM reduced DM, GE, Lys, and Met AID and increased Arg and Gly AID during both collection periods (P < 0.05). At dpi 7 to 8 only, PRRSV reduced DM and GE AID (P < 0.05). At 7 to 8 dpi, BEL of Arg, Ala, and Pro were reduced (P < 0.05) due to PRRSV by 64%, 39%, and 94%, respectively. At dpi 18 to 19, BEL of Thr tended (P = 0.06) to be increased in PRRSV-infected pigs; however, no other differences were observed. Pigs fed LSBM had increased Lys, Met, Thr, Trp, and Pro standardized ileal digestibility (SID), primarily at 7 to 8 dpi. At 7 to 8 dpi, PRRSV reduced Arg, Gly, and Pro SID (P < 0.01), and SID Pro continued to be reduced by 17% at dpi 18 to 19. Compared with HSBM pigs, LSBM reduced hindgut disappearance of DM and GE at dpi 5 to 8 and dpi 16 to 19, while N disappearance was reduced at dpi 5 to 8. There were no differences between control and PRRSV N-free fed pigs. Altogether, SBM inclusion impacts SID of AA and hindgut disappearance of nutrients, regardless of PRRSV. In contrast, there is minimal impact of PRRSV on BEL, and therefore, SID of most AA are not different.","Schweer, Wesley P; Patience, John F; Burrough, Eric R; Kerr, Brian J; Gabler, Nicholas K",Journal of Animal Science,122,20

The present study aimed to evaluate bioactive compounds found in plants using a molecular docking approach to inhibit the main protease (M(pro)) and spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. The evaluation was performed on the docking scores calculated using AutoDock Vina (AV) as a docking engine. A rule of five (Ro5) was calculated to determine whether a compound meets the criteria as an active drug orally in humans. The determination of the docking score was performed by selecting the best conformation of the protein-ligand complex that had the highest affinity (most negative Gibbs' free energy of binding/ΔG). As a comparison, nelfinavir (an antiretroviral drug), chloroquine, and hydroxychloroquine sulfate (antimalarial drugs recommended by the FDA as emergency drugs) were used. The results showed that hesperidin, nabiximols, pectolinarin, epigallocatechin gallate, and rhoifolin had better poses than nelfinavir, chloroquine, and hydroxychloroquine sulfate as spike glycoprotein inhibitors. Hesperidin, rhoifolin, pectolinarin, and nabiximols had about the same pose as nelfinavir but were better than chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine sulfate as M(pro) inhibitors. This finding implied that several natural compounds of plants evaluated in this study showed better binding free energy compared to nelfinavir, chloroquine, and hydroxychloroquine sulfate, which so far are recommended in the treatment of COVID-19. From quantum chemical DFT calculations, the ascending order of chemical reactivity of selected compounds was pectolinarin > hesperidin > rhoifolin > morin > epigallocatechin gallate. All isolated compounds' C=O regions are preferable for an electrophilic attack, and O-H regions are suitable for a nucleophilic attack. Furthermore, Homo-Lumo and global descriptor values indicated a satisfactory remarkable profile for the selected compounds. As judged by the RO5 and previous study by others, the compounds kaempferol, herbacetin, eugenol, and 6-shogaol have good oral bioavailability, so they are also seen as promising candidates for the development of drugs to treat infections caused by SARS-CoV-2. The present study identified plant-based compounds that can be further investigated in vitro and in vivo as lead compounds against SARS-CoV-2.","Tallei, Trina Ekawati; Tumilaar, Sefren Geiner; Niode, Nurdjannah Jane; Fatimawali,; Kepel, Billy Johnson; Idroes, Rinaldi; Effendi, Yunus; Sakib, Shahenur Alam; Emran, Talha Bin",Scientifica (Cairo),122,1

Epidemiologic and experimental studies suggest that URIs play a causal role in the pathogenesis of AOM. Specifically, viruses can either invade the middle ear (ME) space and invoke an inflammatory response that culminates in ME effusion formation and consequent symptoms, or URIs might cause eustachian-tube dysfunction, resulting in negative ME pressures and subsequent ME effusion (hydrops ex vacuo theory). The events responsible for the inflammatory response of the human ME following viral exposure have not been well characterized. Although many prophylactic and therapeutic interventions have been evaluated for the treatment of AOM, the information on virusspecific interventions is sparse. In this article, the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of viral otitis media are reviewed.","Buchman, Craig A.; Brinson, George M.",Curr Allergy Asthma Rep,122,16

Do it whenever you need it!,14.696921,4.8623815,2020-09-04,"BACKGROUND: Practice-based interprofessional education (IPE) is essential to prepare students for collaborative working. Pockets of practice-based IPE are integrated into healthcare curriculums in some regions. Yet practice-based IPE is not globally valued as a key element of healthcare curriculums. As students and clinical educators are key stakeholders, this study presents a case example of their experiences in a country where practice-based IPE is at an emergent stage. Their experiential knowledge generated important insights into how practice-based IPE is perceived. This learning can be applied, both locally and further afield, by those seeking to embed practice-based IPE in their placement curriculums. METHODS: A qualitative case study was conducted at a school of allied health and partner placement sites in Ireland. Data collection comprised two participant observations, 13 interviews and 12 document analyses. Inductive thematic analysis and deductive framework analysis, underpinned by activity theory and Hofstede’s cultural dimensions, informed data analysis and interpretations. RESULTS: Participants are grappling to establish the value of practice-based IPE, illustrated in three themes: clarifying the concept of practice-based IPE, mapping IPE activities and diversifying interprofessionalism. First, ambiguous conceptualisation of why and how to implement practice-based IPE was identified. Highlighting how practice-based IPE improved patient care and safety created a clear rationale for implementation. It was also helpful to demonstrate how adaptations to existing practice education models, rather than entirely new models, could achieve high-quality practice-based IPE. Second, the positioning of practice-base IPE in the placement curriculum was unclear. Overt mapping of practice-based IPE activities onto learning outcomes within assessment tools enhanced its value within practice education. Third, varying levels of professional engagement were noted, perpetuating stereotypes. Creating diverse educator networks and embedding practice-based IPE in organisational strategy may incentivise engagement across a greater range of professions. CONCLUSIONS: Implementing these recommendations could enhance the value of practice-based IPE and optimise student preparation for collaborative working. Practice-based IPE remains a complex model and the trajectory of embedding in healthcare curriculums will differ globally.

This is critical among hernia repairs, where improved outcomes are reliant on understanding the impact of different patient characteristics and surgical approaches. In this context, a hernia-specific synoptic operative note was piloted as part of an effort to create a statewide hernia registry. We aimed to understand the impact of the synoptic operative note on variable missingness and evaluate barriers and facilitators to improved intraoperative communication and note adoption. METHODS: In January 2020, the Michigan Surgical Quality Collaborative (MSQC) registry was expanded to capture hernia-specific intraoperative variables. A synoptic operative note for hernia repair was piloted at 8 hospitals. The primary outcome was change in hernia variable communication, measured by missingness. Using a sequential explanatory mixed-methods design, we performed semi-structured interviews with data abstractors (n = 4) and surgeons (n = 4) at 5 pilot sites to assess barriers and facilitators of implementation. Interviews were iteratively analyzed using content analysis with both deductive and inductive approaches. RESULTS: From January to June 2020, 870 hernia repairs were performed across 8 pilot and 53 control sites. Pilot sites had significantly less missingness for all hernia-specific variables. At pilot sites, 46% of notes were fully complete in regard to hernia variables, compared to 21% at control sites (p value < 0.001). While collection of intraoperative variables improved after synoptic note implementation, low note adoption was reported. Facilitators of improved variable collection were (1) communication with data abstractors and (2) stakeholder acknowledgment of widespread benefit, while barriers included (1) surgeon resistance to practice change, (2) EMR/technology, and (3) interruptions to communication and implementation. CONCLUSION: This mixed-methods evaluation of a synoptic operative note implementation suggests that sustained communication, particularly with abstractors, was the most impactful intervention. Future implementation efforts may have improved effectiveness with interventions supplementary to surgeon-level direction.

Regulated childcare services were closed due to the pandemic between March 16 and May 31, 2020, in areas considered “hot” (highly affected by the pandemic). During this time, some centers were transformed into “emergency childcare services” available to parents considered to be essential workers. Therefore, few children attended, and most educators worked remotely. In May 2020, 372 educators completed an online questionnaire regarding their emotional state, challenges, and learning opportunities. Results indicate that half of the respondents reported a decrease in their level of well-being at work and an increase in their stress level. Educators working remotely were more likely to report a lower level of stress than when working with children at daycare (36.1% vs 19.7%). Despite these findings, educators estimated that the parents who used their emergency childcare service presented either high (37.7%) or average (32.2%) levels of wellbeing. The factors that educators identified as facilitating their interactions with families included parental recognition of their work (11.68%) and direct contact with them (12.62%). While many tasks accomplished at home were done for the first time during this period (i.e., creating video capsules for children and parents, virtual meetings with children and colleagues), a large majority of respondents reported that these tasks made them feel useful. Working at their own pace (34.7%) was seen as the principal advantage of remote working. Finally, 28.84% mentioned that the reduced ratio (1:2 or 1:3) was a facilitating factor that they would like to maintain during the upcoming reopening phase. The discussion uses the Job Demands and Resources theoretical framework (Bakker and Demerouti in Wellbeing 3(2):1–28, 2014; Dicke et al. in J Occupat Health Psychol 23(2): 262–277, 2017) to explain the educators’ work-related demands and emotional state in both remote and CPE working pandemic contexts. In conclusion, we argued that this pandemic reveals the complexity, but also the essential nature of the work of early childhood educators, in particular by identifying their needs for support and recognition essential to their professional commitment.","Bigras, Nathalie; Lemay, Lise; Lehrer, Joanne; Charron, Annie; Duval, Stéphanie; Robert-Mazaye, Christelle; Laurin, et Isabelle",Early Child Educ J,122,17

MATERIAL/METHODS: A quasi-experimental study was performed to investigate situations of antibiotic use in secondary and tertiary general hospitals in Tianjin from April 2011 to 2013. Five major indicators were analyzed: percentage of antibiotic use in inpatient cases (%), antibacterial use density (AUD), proportion of prophylactic antibiotic application for type I surgical incision, compliance rate of medication administration 0.5–2.0 h before such procedures, and antibiotic prophylaxis for ≤24 h in patients receiving these surgeries. RESULTS: There was a decrease in the percentage of antibiotic use across general hospitals (60.38% to 46.88%), in AUD (51.60% to 35.37%), and in the proportion of prophylactic antibiotic applications for type I incisions (86.67% to 25.08%). For patients undergoing these procedures, there was an increased compliance rate of medication administration of 0.5–2.0 h prior to surgery (86.38% to 100%), and of antibiotic prophylactic use for ≤24 h (40.30% to 96.37%).

The biggest complication is pneumonia, which has a serious inflammatory component, with no standardized treatment. Low-dose radiation therapy (LD-RT) is non-invasive and has anti-inflammatory effects that can interfere with the inflammatory cascade, thus reducing the severity of associated cytokine release and might be useful in the treatment of respiratory complications caused by COVID-19. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This multicentric prospective clinical trial seeks to evaluate the efficacy of bilateral lung LD-RT therapy as a treatment for interstitial pneumonia in patients with COVID-19 for improving respiratory function. This prospective study will have 2 phases: I) an exploratory phase enrolling 10 patients, which will assess the feasibility and efficacy of low-dose lung irradiation, evaluated according to an increase in the PaO2/FiO2 ratio of at least 20% at 48–72 h with respect to the pre-irradiation value. If a minimum efficiency of 30% of the patients is not achieved, the study will not be continued. II) Non-randomized comparative phase in two groups: a control group, which will only receive pharmacological treatment, and an experimental arm with pharmacological treatment and LD-RT. It will include 96 patients, the allocation will be 1: 2, that is, 32 in the control arm and 64 in the experimental arm. The primary end-point will be the efficacy of LD-RT in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia according to an improvement in PaO2/FiO2. Secondary objectives will include the safety of bilateral lung LD-RT, an improvement in the radiology image, overall mortality rates at 15 and 30 days after irradiation and characterizing anti-inflammatory mechanisms of LD-RT by measuring the level of expression of adhesion molecules, anti-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress mediators.

Infectious diseases outbreaks like the ongoing COVID19 pandemic have negative impact on healthcare workers' (HCWs) mental health, which needs to be investigated. Therefore, we aimed to assess the psychological impact of COVID-19 on frontline HCWs and their coping strategies. Methods: A web-based, cross-sectional study was conducted among HCWs of the Punjab province of Pakistan. The generalized anxiety scale (GAD-7), patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Brief-COPE were used to assess anxiety, depression and coping strategies of the respondents. Results: The mean age of respondents (N = 398) was 28.67 {+/-} 4.15 years, with majority of medical doctors (52%). The prevalence of anxiety and depression were 21.4% and 21.9%, respectively. There was no significant difference of anxiety and depression scores among doctors, nurses and pharmacists.

AIMS: This study aims to identify the pathological findings at autopsy of asymptomatic COVID-19 death, to compare the incidence of acute bilateral pulmonary thromboembolism (ABPTE) in asymptomatic COVID-19 deaths versus non-COVID-19 deaths and to explore the possible pathogenesis of thrombosis in COVID-19. We also consider the place of COVID-19 in the death certification of 4 cases who died from ABPTE. METHODS: This study primarily reviewed post-mortem reports of 6 asymptomatic COVID-19 deaths. Post-mortem reports for the years 2019 and 2020 were also reviewed to establish the incidence of ABPTE. Each post-mortem report was reviewed for gross examination, histology and toxicology findings. A literature review on COVID-19 autopsy findings, COVID-19 pathogenesis, thrombosis in COVID-19 and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection was also conducted using PubMed. RESULTS: Of the 6 asymptomatic COVID-19 deaths, 4 died as a result of ABPTE, 1 died of ischaemic and hypertensive cardiac disease caused by coronary artery disease and ventricular hypertrophy and the remaining case died of heart failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy caused by subendocardial fibrosis. There were 2 cases of bilateral pulmonary thromboembolism (BPTE) in 2019 out of 140 post-mortems. Excluding the 4 cases of ABPTE described already, there was 1 case of ABPTE in 2020 out of 156 post-mortems.

Theoretically, viral antigen is the specific marker of the virus and precedes antibody appearance within the infected population. There is a clear need of detection of viral antigen for rapid and early diagnosis. METHODS We included a cohort of 239 participants with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection from 7 centers for the study. We measured nucleocapsid protein in nasopharyngeal swab samples in parallel with the nucleic acid test. Nucleic acid test was taken as the reference standard, and statistical evaluation was taken in blind. We detected nucleocapsid protein in 20 urine samples in another center, employing nasopharyngeal swab nucleic acid test as reference standard. RESULTS We developed a fluorescence immunochromatographic assay for detecting nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swab sample and urine within 10 minutes. 100% of nucleocapsid protein positive and negative participants accord with nucleic acid test for same samples. Further, earliest participant after 3 days of fever can be identified by the method. In an additional preliminary study, we detected nucleocapsid protein in urine in 73.6% of diagnosed COVID-19 patients.

The viral spike (S) glycoprotein is responsible for mediating receptor binding and membrane fusion. Recent studies have proposed that the carboxyl terminal portion (S2 subunit) of the S protein is a class I viral fusion protein. The Wimley and White interfacial hydrophobicity scale was used to identify regions within the CoV S2 subunit that may preferentially associate with lipid membranes with the premise that peptides analogous to these regions may function as inhibitors of viral infectivity. Five regions of high interfacial hydrophobicity spanning the length of the S2 subunit of SARS-CoV and murine hepatitis virus (MHV) were identified. Peptides analogous to regions of the N-terminus or the pre-transmembrane domain of the S2 subunit inhibited SARS-CoV plaque formation by 40–70% at concentrations of 15–30 μM. Interestingly, peptides analogous to the SARS-CoV or MHV loop region inhibited viral plaque formation by >80% at similar concentrations. The observed effects were dose-dependent (IC50 values of 2–4 μM) and not a result of peptide-mediated cell cytotoxicity. The antiviral activity of the CoV peptides tested provides an attractive basis for the development of new fusion peptide inhibitors corresponding to regions outside the fusion protein heptad repeat regions.","Sainz, Bruno; Mossel, Eric C.; Gallaher, William R.; Wimley, William C.; Peters, C.J.; Wilson, Russell B.; Garry, Robert F.",Virus Research,122,9

This was a substantial shift from a more restrictive system of coverage in previous years. However, irregular migrants continue to experience challenges accessing healthcare in Spain. This study aimed to describe the legislative and administrative barriers to implementation of this law from the perspective of providers and administrators of the healthcare system. DESIGN: We interviewed 12 individuals using a semistructured format. SETTING: Spain. PARTICIPANTS: 12 participants were interviewed; 7 males, 5 females. Participants included Spanish healthcare workers, government officials, hospital administrators, individuals working with non-governmental organisations focused on the provision of healthcare, and experts studying healthcare for underserved populations. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Interviews delved into personal experiences and knowledge of the entitlements and barriers of providing or trying to access care for undocumented migrants. RESULTS: The interviews yielded eight key themes: (1) context of universal healthcare in Spain pre-2012; (2) erosion of trust as rationale for more restrictive policies of 2012; (3) challenges of the 3-month residency requirement; (4) areas of ambiguity: exceptions in the 2012 Royal Decree Law not discussed in the 2018 Royal Decree Law; (5) jurisdictional authority and conflicts between national and AC government; (6) near impossibility of obtaining documentation for exportation of healthcare; (7) difficulties obtaining necessary paperwork to register residency; and (8) rise of NGOs to provide support to irregular migrants. CONCLUSION: While there has been a general political movement to expand healthcare access for undocumented migrants in Spain, there remains a fundamental need to clarify the legal entitlements for undocumented migrants nationally and create administrative consistency across autonomous communities for providing health cards for undocumented migrants. Other countries may be able to draw lessons from the Spanish experience about the legislative frameworks surrounding access to healthcare for undocumented migrants.","Hsia, Renee Y; Gil-González, Diana",BMJ Open,122,27

One such prevalent form of xenophobia, is Islamophobia or “fear and discrimination against the Muslims.” Though debated over its various facets and definitions, it is on the rise worldwide. India, being a socio-politically diverse and populous nation, has been facing unique challenges during COVID-19.

Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) is an isothermal nucleic acid amplification technique, and RPA-based diagnostic assays have been described for the detection of different types of pathogens. RESULTS: The RPA assays using real-time fluorescence detection (real-time RPA) and lateral flow strip detection (LFS RPA) were developed to detect M. ovipneumoniae targeting a conserved region of the 16S rRNA gene. Real-time RPA was performed in a portable florescence scanner at 39 °C for 20 min. LFS RPA was performed in a portable metal bath incubator at 39 °C for 15 min, and the amplicons were visualized with the naked eyes within 5 min on the lateral flow strip. Both assays were highly specific for M. ovipneumoniae, as there were no cross-reactions with other microorganisms tested, especially the pathogens involved in respiratory complex and other mycoplasmas frequently identified in ruminants. The limit of detection of LFS RPA assay was 1.0 × 10(1) copies per reaction using a recombinant plasmid containing target gene as template, which is 10 times lower than the limit of detection of the real-time RPA and real-time PCR assays. The RPA assays were further validated on 111 clinical sheep nasal swab and fresh lung samples, and M. ovipneumoniae DNA was detected in 29 samples in the real-time RPA, 31 samples in the LFS RPA and 32 samples in the real-time PCR assay. Compared to real-time PCR, the real-time RPA and LFS RPA showed diagnostic specificity of 100 and 98.73%, diagnostic sensitivity of 90.63 and 93.75%, and a kappa coefficient of 0.932 and 0.934, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The developed real-time RPA and LFS RPA assays provide the attractive and promising tools for rapid, convenient and reliable detection of M. ovipneumoniae in sheep, especially in resource-limited settings. However, the effectiveness of the developed RPA assays in the detection of M. ovipneumoniae in goats needs to be further validated.","Wang, Jinfeng; Li, Ruiwen; Sun, Xiaoxia; Liu, Libing; Hao, Xuepiao; Wang, Jianchang; Yuan, Wanzhe",BMC Vet Res,122,29

Here, we report that GCRV VP56 inhibits host IFN production by degrading the transcription factor IFN regulatory factor 7 (IRF7). First, overexpression of VP56 inhibited the IFN production induced by the polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) and mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), while the capacity of IRF7 on IFN induction was unaffected. Second, VP56 interacted with RLRs but did not affect the stabilization of the proteins in the normal state, while the phosphorylated IRF7 activated by TBK1 was degraded by VP56 through K48-linked ubiquitination. Finally, overexpression of VP56 remarkably reduced the host cellular ifn transcription and facilitated viral proliferation. Taken together, our results demonstrate that GCRV VP56 suppresses the host IFN response by targeting phosphorylated IRF7 for ubiquitination and degradation.","Zhang, Can; Lu, Long-Feng; Li, Zhuo-Cong; Zhou, Xiao-Yu; Zhou, Yu; Chen, Dan-Dan; Li, Shun; Zhang, Yong-An",Fish Shellfish Immunol,122,28

A spectral imaging-based surface plasmon resonance (SPRi) platform with an integrated microfluidic biosensor to detect oligonucleotide sequences has been proposed to be a promising alternative for infectious diseases due to its safe and straightforward use. Approaches to reduce the DNA probe loading onto gold nanoparticles with various types of polyethylene glycol (PEG) were explored. Here, we demonstrated the stability of functionalised gold nanoparticles with unmodified PEG whilst lowering the probe loading density. The system was evaluated by performing the detection of a mimicking COVID-19 target sequence, single point-mutation sequence and fully mismatch sequence. Highly specific binding of the mimicking COVID-19 target sequence was observed and analysed by the spectral imaging SPR approach. Our work has demonstrated the potential of a controlled probe density using unmodified PEG as an especially promising functionalisation strategy in SPR spectral imaging assays.","Yeung, Wing Kiu; Lo, Shu-Cheng; Wang, Sheng-Hann; Wei, Pei-Kuen; Cheng, Ji-Yen",The Analyst,122,16

A growing body of literature describes population-level SARS-CoV-2 exposure, but studies of antibody seroprevalence within school systems are critically lacking, hampering evidence-based discussions on school reopenings. The Lake Central School Corporation (LCSC), a public school system in suburban Indiana, USA, assessed SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in its staff and identified correlations between seropositivity and subjective histories and demographics. METHODS: This study is a cross-sectional, population-based analysis of the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in LCSC staff measured in July 2020. We tested for seroprevalence with the Abbott Alinity™ SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody test. The primary outcome was the total seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2, and secondary outcomes included trends of antibody presence in relation to baseline attributes. FINDINGS: 753 participants representative of the staff at large were enrolled. 22 participants (2·9%, 95% CI: 1·8% – 4·4%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Correcting for test performance parameters, the seroprevalence is estimated at 1·7% (90% Credible Interval: 0·27% – 3·3%). Multivariable logistic regression including mask wearing, travel history, symptom history, and contact history revealed a 48-fold increase in the odds of seropositivity if an individual previously tested positive for COVID-19 (OR: 48.2, 95% CI: 4 – 600). Amongst individuals with no previous positive test, exposure to a person diagnosed with COVID-19 increased the odds of seropositivity by 7-fold (OR: 6.5, 95% CI: 2.06 – 18.9). INTERPRETATION: Assuming the presence of antibodies is associated with immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection, these results demonstrate a broad lack of herd immunity amongst the school corporation’s staff irrespective of employment role or location. Protective measures like contact tracing face coverings, and social distancing are therefore vital to maintaining the safety of both students and staff as the school year progresses.

Inactivation of YopH activity would lead to the loss of bacterial pathogenicity. We have studied the inhibitory properties of aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) against YopH phosphatase and found that at nanomolar concentrations ATA reversibly decreases the activity of YopH. Computational docking studies indicated that in all binding poses ATA binds in the YopH active site. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that in the predicted binding pose, ATA binds to the essential Cys403 and Arg409 residues in the active site and has a stronger binding affinity than the natural substrate (pTyr). The cyclic voltammetry experiments suggest that ATA reacts remarkably strongly with molecular oxygen. Additionally, the electrochemical reduction of ATA in the presence of a negative potential from −2.0 to 2.5 V generates a current signal, which is observed for hydrogen peroxide. Here we showed that ATA indicates a unique mechanism of YopH inactivation due to a redox process. We proposed that the potent inhibitory properties of ATA are a result of its strong binding in the YopH active site and in situ generation of hydrogen peroxide near catalytic cysteine residue.","Kuban-Jankowska, Alicja; Sahu, Kamlesh K; Niedzialkowski, Pawel; Gorska, Magdalena; Tuszynski, Jack A; Ossowski, Tadeusz; Wozniak, Michal",Oncotarget,122,16

METHODS: We analyzed data from laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases registered from February 27-August 31, 2020 in Mexico City’s public database. Individuals were classified as non-HCW and HCW (subcategorized as physicians, nurses and other HCW). In hospitalized individuals, a multivariate logistic regression model was used to analyze potential factors associated with death and compare mortality risk among groups. RESULTS: A total of 125,665 patients were included. Of these, 13.1% were HCW (28% physicians, 38% nurses and 34% other HCW). Compared with non-HCW, HCW were more frequently female, younger and free of comorbidities. Overall, 25,771 (20.5%) were treated as inpatients and 11,182 (8.9%) deaths were reported. Deaths in the total population and in hospitalized patients were significantly higher in non-HCW than in HCW (9.9% vs 1.9%, P<.001; and 39.6% vs 19.3%, P<.001, respectively). In hospitalized patients, using a multivariate model, the risk of death in HCW in general was lower (OR 0.53) compared to non-HCW, and by specific occupation, in physicians, nurses and other HCW risk was OR 0.60, 0.29, 0.61, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: HCW represent an important proportion of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Mexico City. While the mortality risk in HCW is lower compared with non-HCW, a high mortality rate in hospitalized patients was observed in this study. Among HCW, nurses had lower risk of death compared to physicians and other HCW.","Guerrero-Torres, Lorena; Caro-Vega, Yanink; Crabtree-Ramírez, Brenda; Sierra-Madero, Juan G",Clin Infect Dis,122,1

Within that population, healthcare workers are at a high risk of back pain. Though they often demonstrate awkward postures and impaired balance in comparison with healthy workers, there is no clear relationship between compensatory postural responses to unpredictable stimuli and the strength of related muscle groups, in particular in individuals with mild to moderate back pain. This paper presents a study protocol that aims to evaluate the relationship between peak anterior to peak posterior displacements of the center of pressure (CoP) and corresponding time from peak anterior to peak posterior displacements of the CoP after sudden external perturbations and peak force during a maximum voluntary isometric contraction of the back and hamstring muscles in physiotherapists with non-specific back pain in its early stages. Participants will complete the Oswestry Disability Questionnaire. Those that rate their back pain on the 0–10 Low Back Pain Scale in the ranges 1–3 (mild pain) and 4–6 (moderate pain) will be considered. They will undergo a perturbation-based balance test and a test of the maximal isometric strength of back muscles and hip extensors. We assume that by adding tests of reactive balance and strength of related muscle groups in the functional testing of physiotherapists, we would be able to identify back problems earlier and more efficiently and therefore address them well before chronic back disorders occur.","Zemková, Erika; Ďurinová, Eva; Džubera, Andrej; Horníková, Henrieta; Chochol, Juraj; Koišová, Jana; Šimonová, Michaela; Zapletalová, Ludmila",Int J Environ Res Public Health,122,20

The plasticity of stem cells is one of the major criteria for generating organoids most similar to the tissue structures they intend to mimic. Stem cells are cells with unique properties of self-renewal and differentiation. Depending on their origin, a distinction is made between pluripotent (embryonic) stem cells (PSCs), adult (or tissue) stem cells (ASCs), and those obtained by somatic reprogramming, so-called induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). While most data since the 1980s have been acquired in the mouse model, and then from the late 1990s in humans, the process of somatic reprogammation has revolutionized the field of stem cell research. For domestic animals, numerous attempts have been made to obtain PSCs and iPSCs, an approach that makes it possible to omit the use of embryos to derive the cells. Even if the plasticity of the cells obtained is not always optimal, the recent progress in obtaining reprogrammed cells is encouraging. Along with PSCs and iPSCs, many organoid derivations in animal species are currently obtained from ASCs.

We assessed the prognostic implications of endothelial activation through measurement of endothelin-I precursor peptide (proET-1), the stable precursor protein of Endothelin-1, in a well-defined cohort of patients hospitalized with COVID-19. METHODS: We measured proET-1 in 74 consecutively admitted adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 and compared its prognostic accuracy to that of patients with community-acquired pneumonia (n = 876) and viral bronchitis (n = 371) from a previous study by means of logistic regression analysis. The primary endpoint was all-cause 30-day mortality. RESULTS: Overall, median admission proET-1 levels were lower in COVID-19 patients compared to those with pneumonia and exacerbated bronchitis, respectively (57.0 pmol/l vs. 113.0 pmol/l vs. 96.0 pmol/l, p < 0.01). Although COVID-19 non-survivors had 1.5-fold higher admission proET-1 levels compared to survivors (81.8 pmol/l [IQR: 76 to 118] vs. 53.6 [IQR: 37 to 69]), no significant association of proET-1 levels and mortality was found in a regression model adjusted for age, gender, creatinine level, diastolic blood pressure as well as cancer and coronary artery disease (adjusted OR 0.1, 95% CI 0.0009 to 14.7). In patients with pneumonia (adjusted OR 25.4, 95% CI 5.1 to 127.4) and exacerbated bronchitis (adjusted OR 120.1, 95% CI 1.9 to 7499) we found significant associations of proET-1 and mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to other types of pulmonary infection, COVID-19 shows only a mild activation of the endothelium as assessed through measurement of proET-1.

Immunohistochemistry was utilized to detect the expression levels of ZNF436, β-catenin, EGFR and CMTM5 in cancerous and paracancerous tissues of breast cancer patients. The expression levels of ZNF436, β-Catenin and EGFR in breast cancer tissues were significantly greater than those in paracancerous tissues in this study (p<0.05), while CMTM5 was highly expressed in paracancerous tissues (p<0.05).

This study aims to explore the influence of COVID-19 on exercise behavior and its impact on mood states, as well as predict changes in exercise behavior during a similar future pandemic in Taiwan. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted between 7 April and 13 May 2020 (n = 1114). Data on exercise behavior pre and during the pandemic and mood states were collected. A cumulative link model was used to predict changes in exercise frequency during a similar future pandemic by exercise frequency during the pandemic. A linear model was used to predict the influence of exercise frequency before and during the pandemic on mood states during the pandemic. A total of 71.2%, 67.3%, and 58.3% of respondents maintained their exercise intensity, frequency, and duration, respectively, during the pandemic. Frequent exercisers are more likely to maintain their exercise frequency during a similar pandemic (p < 0.001). Higher exercise frequencies during the pandemic were associated with better mood states (p < 0.05). Moreover, the effects of prepandemic exercise frequency on mood states are moderated by changes in exercise frequency during the pandemic (p < 0.05). Additionally, maintenance of exercise frequency during a pandemic specifically for frequent exercisers are recommended to preserve mood states. These results may provide evidence for health policies on exercise promotion and mental health before and during a future pandemic.","Chang, Yu-Kai; Hung, Chiao-Ling; Timme, Sinika; Nosrat, Sanaz; Chu, Chien-Heng",Int J Environ Res Public Health,122,26

SARS-CoV-2 has infected several millions of people, resulting in a huge socioeconomic cost and over 2.5 million deaths worldwide. Though the pathogenesis of COVID-19 is not fully understood, data have consistently shown that SARS-CoV-2 mainly affects the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. Nevertheless, accumulating evidence has implicated the central nervous system in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Unfortunately, however, the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 induced impairment of the central nervous system are not completely known. Here, we review the literature on possible neuropathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 induced cerebral damage. The results suggest that downregulation of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) with increased activity of the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and cathepsin L in SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion may result in upregulation of proinflammatory mediators and reactive species that trigger neuroinflammatory response and blood brain barrier disruption. Furthermore, dysregulation of hormone and neurotransmitter signalling may constitute a fundamental mechanism involved in the neuropathogenic sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The viral RNA or antigenic peptides also activate or interact with molecular signalling pathways mediated by pattern recognition receptors (e.g., toll-like receptors), nuclear factor kappa B, Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription, complement cascades, and cell suicide molecules. Potential molecular targets and therapeutics of SARS-CoV-2 induced neurologic damage are also discussed.","Welcome, Menizibeya O.; Mastorakis, Nikos E.",Inflammopharmacology,122,15
