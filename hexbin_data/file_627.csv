297295,"COVID-19 Outbreak Among College Students After a Spring Break Trip to Mexico - Austin, Texas, March 26-April 5, 2020",2020,"BACKGROUND: Reports of severe COVID-19 being associated with thrombosis, antiphospholipid antibodies (APLA), and antiphospholipid syndrome have yielded disparate conclusions. Studies comparing patients with COVID-19 with contemporaneous controls of similar severity are lacking. METHODS: 22 COVID-19+ and 20 COVID-19- patients with respiratory failure admitted to intensive care were studied longitudinally. Demographic and clinical data were obtained from the day of admission. APLA testing included anticardiolipin (aCL), anti-ß2glycoprotien 1 (ß2GP1), antidomain 1 ß2GP1 and antiphosphatidyl serine/prothrombin complex. Antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) were detected by immunofluorescence and antibodies to cytokines by a commercially available multiplexed array. Analysis of variance was used for continuous variables and Fisher's exact test was used for categorical variables with &#945;=0.05 and the false discovery rate at q=0.05. RESULTS: APLAs were predominantly IgG aCL (48%), followed by IgM (21%) in all patients, with a tendency towards higher frequency among the COVID-19+. aCL was not associated with surrogate markers of thrombosis but IgG aCL was strongly associated with worse disease severity and higher ANA titres regardless of COVID-19 status. An association between aCL and anticytokine autoantibodies tended to be higher among the COVID-19+. CONCLUSIONS: Positive APLA serology was associated with more severe disease regardless of COVID-19 status.

386813,"National, Regional, State, and Selected Local Area Vaccination Coverage Among Adolescents Aged 13-17 Years - United States, 2019",2020,"Based on a survey of undergraduate business students at a private Midwestern university in the United States, we found that the abrupt mid-semester transition from campus learning to at-home online learning due to the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic led to an unexpected challenge for students Students reported that stay-at-home learning eroded support for their student role while also creating conflicts between the student role and other competing roles, such as child, sibling, or supplemental wage earner As a result, they significantly lacked motivation to complete schoolwork during stay-at-home orders Using a framework rooted in role identity theory, we analyze this role erosion and role conflict Based on that analysis, we suggest potential actions for faculty to mitigate the adverse impact that this role erosion/conflict has on learning and, thus, bolster the student role while simultaneously reducing conflict between the student role and other competing roles As we brace for multiple semesters of teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic, such efforts to facilitate positive stay-at-home learning experiences for our students will contribute to determining our academic success and our educational institutions’ economic viability","Hvalshagen, Merete Lakshmi Nittala Raman Roopa Sullivan Nicholas Zolbanin Hamed M.",Communications of the Association for Information Systems,,627

Rather, the effects of the lockdown have impacted several sectors of the real economy. So far, stationary retail trade, the tourism sector and hotels and restaurants have been hit by the lockdown. In addition, industry has been particularly affected by an interruption in supply chains. The automotive industry even temporarily halted production completely. The question now is to what extent the corona pandemic may destabilise the banking sector.","Demary, Markus; Hüther, Michael",Wirtschaftsdienst,,627

471137,"COVID-19 Testing to Sustain In-Person Instruction and Extracurricular Activities in High Schools - Utah, November 2020-March 2021",2021,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Telemedicine is a rapidly growing healthcare sector that can improve access to care for underserved populations and offer flexibility and convenience to patients and clinicians alike. However, uncertainty about insurance coverage and reimbursement policies for telemedicine has historically been a major barrier to adoption, especially among physicians in private practice (the majority of practicing allergists). RECENT FINDINGS: The COVID-19 public health emergency has highlighted the importance of telehealth as a safe and effective healthcare delivery model, with governments and payers rapidly expanding coverage and payment in an effort to ensure public access to healthcare in the midst of an infectious pandemic. This comprehensive review of updated telemedicine coverage and payment policies will include a tabular guide on how to appropriately bill and optimize reimbursement for telemedicine services. This review of current trends in telemedicine coverage, billing, and reimbursement will outline the historical and current state of telemedicine payment policies in the USA, with special focus on recent policy changes implemented in light of COVID-19. The authors will also explore the potential future landscape of telehealth coverage and reimbursement beyond the resolution of the public health emergency.","Bajowala, Sakina S; Milosch, Jacob; Bansal, Chandani",Curr Allergy Asthma Rep,,627
513391,Hurricane Evacuation Laws in Eight Southern U.S. Coastal States - December 2018,2020,"After more than six months of the COVID-19 pandemic some of its effects to higher education have been already documented. The higher education institutions around the world rushed to teach online, most of them without any preparation and in some cases in public universities their authorities imposing the technology to be used, the school calendar and new labor relations. At the Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana more than a third of the students considers that learning online has been minimum or null and 76.1% of their professors use their own equipment to teach online and 74.6% work more hours than the established in their contracts. At the Instituto Politécnico Nacional, 20% of its students did not take classes online and 10% of their professors did not teach online. In this paper some of the negative effects of COVID-19 to higher education are referred and discussed, among them, the effects on the salary inequality. Some recommendations are offered to the institutions in their return to ""normal"" activities.","Dominguez-Vergara, Nicolas Dominguez-Perez Daniel Nicolas",Journal of Higher Education Theory and Practice,,627
593884,"Progress Toward Rubella Elimination — World Health Organization European Region, 2005–2019",2021-06-11,"Recent reports indicate that besides respiratory and systemic symptoms among coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients, the disease has a wide spectrum of neurological manifestations (encephalitis, meningitis, myelitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, metabolic and acute hemorrhagic necrotizing encephalopathy, cerebrovascular diseases, Guillain-Barré syndrome, polyneuritis cranialis, dysautonomia, and myopathies). The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can spread from the respiratory system to the central nervous system, using transneuronal and hematogenous mechanisms. Although not every COVID-19 patient will test positive for the virus in the cerebrospinal fluid exam, the appearance of neurological symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection reveals the importance of understanding the neurologic manifestations and capacity for neural invasion associated with the pathogen. These aspects are relevant for correct diagnosis and treatment, and for the potential development of vaccines. This review highlights the latest evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection with a focus on neurological involvement and potential neuropathogenesis mechanisms.","Puccioni-Sohler, Marzia; Poton, André Rodrigues; Franklin, Milena; da Silva, Samya Jezine; Brindeiro, Rodrigo; Tanuri, Amilcar",Revista da Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical,https://doi.org/10.1590/0037-8682-0477-2020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33027418/,627

Many of these individuals are complicated by underlying health conditions, such as cardiovascular and lung diseases and undermined immune systems. During the pandemic, access to the healthcare systems and support groups is greatly diminished. Current research on COVID-19 has not addressed the unique challenges facing individuals with SUDs, including the heightened vulnerability and susceptibility to the disease. In this systematic review, we will discuss the pathogenesis and pathology of COVID-19, and highlight potential risk factors and complications to these individuals. We will also provide insights and considerations for COVID-19 treatment and prevention in patients with SUDs.","Wei, Yufeng; Shah, Rameen",Pharmaceuticals (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32708495/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ph13070155,627
